Here, for the first time, we evaluated the expression of AMACR protein in normal breast, ductal carcinoma in situ, and <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> By immunoflu-orescence and immunohistochemistry, AMACR was seen in cytoplasmic granules consistent with a mitochondrial and peroxisomal localization. AMACR expression was deter-mined by immunohistochemistry on 160 <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> with long follow-up, using a high-density tissue microarray, and evaluated by two methods: standard pathology review and quantitative image analysis. AMACR was overexpressed in 42 of 160 (26 %) <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> and it {{was associated with a}} decrease in tumor differentiation, a feature of aggressive breast cancer. Quantitative analysis allowed for better discrimination and more accurate evaluation of low-intensity staining. In conclusion, AMACR protein is expressed in normal breast and its expression seems to increase in <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> We observed stronger AMACR protein expression in high-grade carcinomas when compared with low-grade ones.

In bitches no significant variation in PR expression was observed between normal tissue, dysplasias, and benign neoplasms, but was significantly lower in carcinomas. In both species ER and PR expression in <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> did not correlate either with histological parameters or overall survival time. This study demonstrates several differences in steroid hormone dependency between the two species. The percentage of PR-positive feline carcinomas suggests a possible role of progesterone in promoting early tumour cell growth in queens.

40|$|Introduction: Invasive Breast Cancer (IBC) {{has a great}} {{epidemiological}} {{impact in}} our society; {{it is the first}} most frequent cancer among women and the first cause of death from cancer in women worldwide. <b>Invasive</b> ductal <b>carcinoma</b> (IDC) represents the largest group of malignant tumours of the breast, comprising up to 75 % of the cases. It is a heterogeneous entity with no clear definition and its diagnosis is made by the exclusion of other special types of Breast Cancer. Women presenting with <b>Invasive</b> Ductal <b>Carcinoma</b> have a wide range of prognostic outcomes, thus, {{there is a need to}} reassess tumours classified as <b>Invasive</b> Ductal <b>Carcinomas</b> in an effort to elaborate more accurate subclassifications of this heterogeneous entity. It is in this context that, in the pathology unit of Josep Trueta Hospital of Girona, a possible morphological variant of <b>Invasive</b> Ductal <b>Carcinoma</b> has been recognized. It could be described as an <b>Invasive</b> Ductal <b>Carcinoma</b> exhibiting a growth pattern in linear cords, typically seen in <b>Invasive</b> Lobular <b>Carcinoma,</b> yet not fulfilling the criteria to be classified as mixed tumours. To our knowledge, these tumours have not been assessed in past studies. Objective: To assess the clinicopathological characteristics of <b>Invasive</b> Ductal <b>Carcinoma</b> with Lobular Pattern (IDCLp) regarding, age of presentation, nationality, menopausal status, family history, primary tumour size, histological tumour type, histological grade, lymph node status, bilateralism, oestrogen and progesterone receptors, HER 2 overexpression, staging and treatment procedures, disease-free survival and survival time, and to determine whether these characteristics significantly differ from the classic types of <b>Invasive</b> Ductal <b>Carcinoma</b> and <b>Invasive</b> Lobular <b>Carcinoma</b> (ILC). Methods: This is a retrospective, observational and analytical study. Information will be reviewed and collected from the Cancer Registry of Girona database which contains epidemiologic information of all Breast Cancer cases of the province of Girona since 1994. Three cohorts will be analysed retrospectively, between 1994 and 2016, regarding their clinicopathological characteristics: <b>Invasive</b> Ductal <b>Carcinoma</b> with Lobular Pattern cases, <b>Invasive</b> Ductal <b>Carcinoma,</b> and <b>Invasive</b> Lobular Carcinom...|$|R

40|$|Vulvar cancer {{represents}} an important medical problem worldwide whose incidence is increasing {{at an alarming}} rate in young females. Several factors have been linked to vulvar cancer development, but its exact pathogenesis remains to be determined. Vulvar tumorigenesis proceeds through intermediate dysplastic lesions, known as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias, frequently associated with non-neoplastic epithelial disorders of the vulva, such as lichen sclerosus and squamous cell hyperplasia. In this study, the expression of the CDK inhibitor p 27 (Kip 1) and the extent of endogenous oxidative DNA damage were evaluated in vulvar specimens, including normal tissues, lichen sclerosus, squamous cell hyperplasia, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias and <b>invasive</b> squamous cell <b>carcinomas.</b> We found that p 27 (Kip 1) was constantly expressed in normal vulvar epithelium cells while a progressive significant reduction in the percentage of p 27 (Kip 1) -positive cells was observed in vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias (77 %) and in <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (64 %). Mean percentage of positive cells in <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas,</b> but not in vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias, was also significantly lower than squamous cell hyperplasia lesions (78 %) while lichen sclerosus displayed a percentage of positive cells (45 %) significantly lower than both vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias and <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) is considered a sensitive biomarker for oxidative stress. We observed a progressive significant increase in the levels of 8 -OHdG and in the percentage of positive cells from normal vulvar epithelium to vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias (25 %) and to <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (64 %). Squamous cell hyperplasia displayed an intermediate percentage of positive cells comparable to vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias 2 but significantly higher than vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias 1 and lower than <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Lichen sclerosus staining was significantly lower than carcinomas but higher than vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias and squamous cell hyperplasia. These results demonstrate that expression of p 27 (Kip 1) is downregulated while oxidative DNA damage increases from early non-neoplastic epithelial alterations through vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias to <b>invasive</b> vulvar <b>carcinomas.</b> Thus, both parameters might {{play an important role in}} the development of this cancer and their study might contribute to our understanding of human vulvar carcinogenesis. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} factor in predicting outcome in patients with early breast cancer is the stage of the disease. There is no robust marker capable of identifying <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> that despite their small size have a high metastatic potential, and that would benefit from more aggressive treatment. RhoC-GTPase {{is a member of the}} Ras-superfamily and is involved in cell polarity and motility. We hypothesized that RhoC expression would be a good marker to identify breast cancer patients with high risk of developing metastases, and that it would be a prognostic marker useful in the clinic. We developed a specific anti-RhoC antibody and studied archival breast tissues that comprise a broad spectrum of breast disease. One hundred eighty-two specimens from 164 patients were used. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed tissues. Staining intensity was graded 0 to 3 + (0 to 1 + was considered negative and 2 to 3 + was considered positive). RhoC was not expressed in any of the normal, fibrocystic changes, atypical hyperplasia, or ductal carcinoma in situ, but was expressed in 36 of 118 <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> and strongly correlated with tumor stage (P = 0. 01). RhoC had high specificity (88 %) in detecting <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> with metastatic potential. Of the <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> smaller than 1 cm, RhoC was highly specific in detecting tumors that developed metastases. RhoC expression was associated with negative progesterone receptor and HER- 2 /neu overexpression. We characterized RhoC expression in human breast tissues. RhoC is specifically expressed in <b>invasive</b> breast <b>carcinomas</b> capable of metastasizing, and it may be clinically useful in patients with tumors smaller than 1 cm to guide treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Samples from feline normal, dysplastic, and {{neoplastic}} mammary tissues {{were used}} to investigate the usefulness of MIB- 1 labeling index (MIB- 1 I) as a prognostic indicator. Forty-eight queens bearing <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were included in a 2 -year follow-up study. Mammary lesions were classified according to the World Health Organization system, and <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were further graded {{on the basis of}} the degree of tubule formation, the degree of nuclear and cellular pleomorphism, and mitotic count. Additional sections were im-munostained using MIB- 1 antibody, and MIB- 1 I was expressed as a percentage of positive nuclei. In normal mammary gland tissues, the mean MIB- 1 I was 1 %. A low proliferation rate was found in all mammary adenosis and in situ carcinomas, and the highest rates were observed in feline mammary hypertrophy and <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Twenty-one (43. 7 %) of the queens bearing <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were still alive at the end of the trial, and 27 (56. 2 %) had died. The MIB- 1 I was not significantly correlated with clinical outcome, age, histologic type, or grading of the tumors, but a borderline correlation was observed with invasion of lymphatic vessels. Univariate analysis showed that high MIB- 1 I was also not associated with decreased overall survival, whereas the grading system of the tumors had high predictive value (P 0. 0040) for postsurgery survival. The lack of correlation between MIB- 1 I and postsurgery survival suggests that this marker alone is not sufficient to determine a correct prognosis in feline mammary carcinomas, even if it is a useful proliferation marker...|$|R

This study investigated the incomplete inside-out growth pattern (IGP) in <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>carcinoma,</b> not otherwise specified (NOS), and examined the association between incomplete IGP and clinicopathologic features, including the presence of intratumoral lymph vessels (ILV), LVI, nodal metastasis, and prognosis. Tumor tissues from 166 <b>invasive</b> duct <b>carcinomas</b> NOS and 10 IMPCs were immunostained using an anti-epithelial membrane antigen antibody to detect IGP and with D 2 - 40 antibody to determine the presence of ILV and LVI.

Transition areas between IMPC and <b>invasive</b> duct <b>carcinoma</b> NOS also showed prominent incomplete IGP in 9 (90 %) of 10 IMPCs. Incomplete IGP in <b>invasive</b> duct <b>carcinomas</b> NOS was associated with larger tumor size, higher frequencies of ILV, LVI, nodal metastasis, and poorer recurrence-free survival by univariate analysis.

Paraffin sections of 81 breast carcinomas detected through the National Screening Programme were examined for the over-expression of c-erbB- 2 oncoprotein using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique and 2 different specific antibodies: 21 N and 4 D 5. Twenty-one other carcinomas detected in symptomatic patients were similarly examined for comparison. The screen-detected lesions were of 2 types: palpable and impalpable which required needle localization prior to surgical removal. Of the 81 screen-detected tumours, only 8 were c-erbB- 2 positive, compared with 5 out of 21 non-screen-detected tumours. When only <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were considered, 5 out of 63 screen-detected cases were positive, compared with 5 out of 15 symptomatic cases. Four out of the 5 screen-detected positive <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were clinically palpable. Our results show an obvious trend towards a lower prevalence of c-erbB- 2 oncoprotein over-expression in screen-detected carcinomas.

40|$|International audienceWhile most {{invasive}} breast cancers {{consist of}} carcinomas of the ductal type, about 10 % are <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinomas.</b> <b>Invasive</b> lobular and ductal carcinomas differ {{with respect to}} risk factors. <b>Invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinoma</b> is more strongly associated with exposure to female hormones, and therefore its incidence is more subject to variation. This is illustrated by US figures during the 1987 to 2004 period: after 12 Â years of increases, breast cancer incidence declined steadily from 1999 to 2004, reflecting among other causes the decreasing use of menopausal hormone therapy, and these variations were stronger for invasive lobular than for <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>carcinoma.</b> Similarly, <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinoma</b> is more strongly associated with early menarche, late menopause and late age at first birth. As for genetic risk factors, four high-penetrance genes are tested in clinical practice when genetic susceptibility to breast cancer is suspected, BRCA 1, BRCA 2, TP 53 and CDH 1. Germline mutations in BRCA 1 and TP 53 are predominantly associated with <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>carcinoma,</b> while BRCA 2 mutations are associated with both ductal and lobular cancers. CDH 1, the gene coding for the E-cadherin adhesion protein, is of special interest as mutations are associated with <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinoma,</b> but never with ductal carcinoma. It was initially known as the main susceptibility gene for gastric cancer of the diffuse type, but the excess of breast cancers of the lobular type in CDH 1 families led researchers to identify it also as a susceptibility gene for <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinoma.</b> The risk of <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinoma</b> is high in female mutation carriers, as about 50 % are expected to develop the disease.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Aberrant {{expression}} of E-cadherin {{has been associated}} with the development of metastases in patients with breast cancer. Even though the {{expression of}} E-cadherin has been studied in primary breast tumors, little is known about its expression at the distant metastatic sites. We investigate the relationship between E-cadherin expression in primary breast carcinoma and their distant, non-nodal metastases. Methods Immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin was performed in tissues from 30 patients with primary <b>invasive</b> breast <b>carcinoma</b> and their distant metastases. E-cadherin expression was evaluated as normal or aberrant (decreased when compared with normal internal positive controls, or absent). Results Twenty-two (73 %) <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> were ductal, and eight (27 %) were lobular. Of the primary <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>carcinomas,</b> 55 % (12 / 22) had normal E-cadherin expression and 45 % (10 / 22) had aberrant expression. All of the metastases expressed E-cadherin with the same intensity as (12 tumors) or with stronger intensity than (10 tumors) the corresponding primaries. Of the <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinomas,</b> one of eight (12 %) primary carcinomas and none of the metastases expressed E-cadherin in the cell membranes, but they accumulated the protein in the cytoplasm. Conclusion Aberrant E-cadherin expression is frequent in <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>carcinomas</b> that progress to develop distant metastases. Distant metastases consistently express E-cadherin, often more strongly than the primary tumor. <b>Invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinomas</b> have a different pattern of E-cadherin expression, suggesting a different role for E-cadherin in this form of breast carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Lymphovascular {{invasion}} (LVI) {{of breast}} cancer is an independent adverse prognosticator {{that is associated with}} increased regional and distant tumor recurrence. LVI is infrequently encountered in <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinoma</b> when compared to <b>invasive</b> ductal <b>carcinoma.</b> We employed D 2 - 40 antibody, a novel marker for lymphatic endothelial cells, in an attempt to enhance the detection of LVI in <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinomas.</b> We identified 78 patients with <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinoma</b> with known axillary status, who were studied between 2003 and 2006. D 2 - 40 antibody was applied to one representative paraffin block from each case and the results were compared to LVI on routine histology. LVI was identified in 12 (15 %) and 19 (24 %) cases by routine histology and D 2 - 40 antibody, respectively. Eleven of 12 patients (92 %) with LVI identified by routine histology had axillary nodal metastasis compared to 14 of 19 patients (74 %) with LVI identified by D 2 - 40 antibody. LVI was missed by routine histology in 8 cases (10 %). D 2 - 40 antibody enhanced the identification of LVI by 9 % in node negative patients. D 2 - 40 antibody increased the identification of LVI by 12 % in classic <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinoma.</b> In conclusion, D 2 - 40 antibody staining may be useful as an adjunct in detecting LVI in <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinoma,</b> especially in node-negative patients with the classic variant of <b>invasive</b> lobular <b>carcinoma...</b>|$|R

To investigate whether the mdm- 2 /p 53 interaction {{plays a role in}} cervical neoplasms, we performed an immunohistochemical study in archival fixed, embedded specimens that included 178 pre-cancerous lesions (CIN) and <b>invasive</b> squamous-cell <b>carcinomas</b> of clinical stage IB. In addition to p 53, we assessed the p 53 -associated protein, mdm- 2, and the Ki- 67 labelling index (LI). The presence of HPV was assessed by in situ DNA hybridization. Tumor expression of all nuclear proteins was scored as fraction of positive CIN or cancer nuclei. The analysis demonstrated a significant association of the Ki- 67 LI with grade of atypia in cervical neoplasms. p 53 accumulation and mdm- 2 expression are higher in <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> than in pre-cancerous lesions. No correlation was observed with HPV status. An inverse correlation was found between increased tumor-cell proliferation and mdm- 2 expression in <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas</b> (p > 0. 0001). mdm- 2 expression was significantly associated with p 53 accumulation (p > 0. 02). However, the investigated nuclear proteins were not associated with overall survival in patients with <b>invasive</b> <b>carcinomas.</b> Cox stepwise-regression analysis revealed regional lymph node status and depth of invasion to be independent parameters...|$|R
