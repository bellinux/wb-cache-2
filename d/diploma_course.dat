5|$|Einstein's future wife, Mileva Marić, also {{enrolled}} at the Polytechnic that year. She {{was the only woman}} among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching <b>diploma</b> <b>course.</b> Over the next few years, Einstein and Marić's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest. In 1900, Einstein was awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma, but Marić failed the examination with a poor grade in the mathematics component, theory of functions. There have been claims that Marić collaborated with Einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the Annus Mirabilis papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.|$|E

25|$|In 1963 Archer {{was offered}} {{a place at the}} Oxford University Department for Continuing Education to study for a Diploma of Education. The course was based in the department, and Archer became a member of Brasenose College. There have been claims that Archer {{provided}} false evidence of his academic qualifications to Brasenose College: for instance, the apparent citing of an American institution which was actually a bodybuilding club, in gaining admission to the course. It has also been alleged Archer provided false statements about three non-existent A-level passes and a U.S. university degree.

25|$|Student nurses {{currently}} {{receive a}} bursary {{from the government}} to support them during their nurse training. Diploma students in England receive a non-means-tested bursary of around £6,000 – £8,000 per year (with additional allowances for students with dependant children), whereas degree students have their bursary means tested (and often receive considerably less). Degree students are, however, eligible for a proportion of the government's student loan, unlike diploma students. But in Scotland and Wales, all student nurses (regardless of which course they are undertaking) receive the same bursary {{in line with the}} English <b>diploma</b> <b>course.</b> All student nurses in Wales study, initially, for a degree, but may chose to remain at Level 2 for their third year, thereby achieving a diploma rather than a degree.|$|E

Managers at Relate considered his raising of a possible conscionable objection to assisting same-sex couples with sexual issues to be incompatible with the organisation's equal opportunities policy and would {{reduce the number of}} couples he were able to help.

500|$|Soon {{after joining}} the museum, Wheeler {{was elected to}} the council of the Society of Antiquaries. Through the Society, he became {{involved}} in the debate as to who should finance archaeological supervision of building projects in Greater London; his argument was that the City of London Corporation should provide the funding, although in 1926 it was agreed that the Society itself would employ a director of excavation based in Lancaster House to take on the position. Also involved in the largely moribund Royal Archaeological Institute, Wheeler organised its relocation to Lancaster House. In 1927, Wheeler took on an unpaid lectureship at University College London, where he established a graduate <b>diploma</b> <b>course</b> on archaeology; {{one of the first to}} enroll was Stuart Piggott. In 1928, Wheeler curated an exhibit at UCL on [...] "Recent Work in British Archaeology", for which he attracted much press attention.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Barr {{was born}} in Wellington, New Zealand, on 10December 1915; he had a twin brother, Jack. The family moved to Australia when the boys were six.

He was also the Victorian Schoolboys' 100 yards athletics champion three years in succession, from 1926 to 1928. In 1931, aged fifteen, he began his association with the Lord Somers Camp and Power House social and sporting organisations located at Western Port. After leaving school, Barr studied construction at Swinburne Technical College, but later took a <b>diploma</b> <b>course</b> in accountancy and made it his profession. He started playing rugby union in 1935 through {{a friend in the}} Power House club. Weighing [...] and just under [...] tall, Barr gained selection for Victoria as a hooker the following year. In 1939, he was chosen to play in the United Kingdom with the Australian national team, the Wallabies. The tour was cancelled less than a day after the team arrived in the UK on 2September, due to the outbreak of World WarII. Keen to serve as a fighter pilot, Barr initially tried to enlist in the Royal Air Force, but withdrew his application when told that it was unlikely he would fly anytime in the near future, and that he could expect only administrative duties in the interim.|$|E
