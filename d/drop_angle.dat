5|$|According to Walter Bolliger, {{development}} of the Dive Coaster began between 1994 and 1995. On March 14, 1998, the world's first Dive Coaster, Oblivion, opened at Alton Towers. Though Oblivion is classified as a Dive Coaster, {{it does not have}} a true vertical drop as the <b>drop</b> <b>angle</b> is 87-degrees. Two years later, the second Dive Coaster built, Diving Machine G5, opened at Janfusun Fancyworld and also does not have a vertical drop. In 2005, SheiKra opened at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay and was the first Dive Coaster to feature a 90-degree drop and a splashdown element. In 2007, Busch Gardens Williamsburg announced that Griffon would be the first ever Dive Coaster to feature floorless trains and SheiKra would have its trains replaced with floorless ones. In 2011, the first 'mini' Dive Coaster opened at Heide Park Resort, named Krake. Unlike other Dive Coasters, Krake has smaller trains consisting of three rows of six riders.|$|E

A {{three-dimensional}} discrete element method {{analytic model}} of the corn seed metering device with combination inner-cell was established based on its 3 D CAD model, and the three-dimensional particle model of corn seeds was built by using the method of combination spherical particle. The working process of the corn seed metering device was simulated and analyzed by self-developed three-dimensional CAE software. It was observed that the simulative results of the seeding performance, clearing <b>angles</b> and <b>dropping</b> <b>angles</b> of the corn seeds well agreed with the bench test results.

5000|$|In 2011, S&S Worldwide {{set about}} {{building}} two El Loco roller coasters. The first was Timber Drop at Fraispertuis City which opened on July 2, 2011. Following the trend {{from the previous}} versions, this ride had an increased <b>drop</b> <b>angle</b> of 1° (making the drop 113°) to claim the world record. This record was short-lived with Takabisha at Fuji-Q Highland claiming the record just two weeks later. Also in 2011, Warner Bros. Movie World collaborated directly with S&S Worldwide to develop an El Loco roller coaster that was unlike the previous models of Mumbo Jumbo, Steel Hawg and Timber Drop. The park wanted the same style of ride, but with increased capacity. S&S Worldwide {{came up with a}} new train design which features four across seating in two rows, totalling eight riders per train. This gives the ride double the capacity of the previous El Locos. The trains are articulated {{in such a way that}} the first row of four riders moves independently from the second row. Each seat features a pair of stereo speakers in the head rest which are capable of playing multiple tracks for up to 9 minutes on a single charge. Riders are harnessed in to the ride through the use of lap bars and seat belts. This design was showcased by the company at the 2011 IAAPA Attractions Expo. The ride also features a <b>drop</b> <b>angle</b> of 120.5° [...] - [...] the second steepest in the world. Green Lantern Coaster officially opened on December 23, 2011.|$|E

50|$|The {{basic problem}} in bombing is the {{calculation}} of the trajectory of the bomb after it leaves the aircraft. Due {{to the effects of}} air drag, wind and gravity, bombs follow a complex path that changes over time - the path of a bomb dropped from 100 meters looks different from the one when dropped from 5,000 meters. The path was too complex for early systems to calculate directly, and was instead measured experimentally at a bombing range by measuring the distance the bomb traveled forward during its fall, a value known as the range. Using simple trigonometry, this distance can be converted into an angle as seen from the bomber. This angle is measured by setting iron sights to this angle, known as the range angle or <b>drop</b> <b>angle.</b> The bomb aimer sets their sights to that angle, and drops the bombs when the target passes through the crosshairs.|$|E

50|$|The bombsight {{problem is}} the need to {{determine}} the exact spot in the air where the bombs should be dropped to hit a target on the ground. Due to the acceleration of gravity, bombs follow a roughly parabolic path, the steepness being defined by the forward speed of the aircraft at the instant of release. The distance the bombs travel between being dropped and hitting the ground is known as the range, it {{is a function of the}} speed and the time to fall, the later a function of altitude. The bomber attempts to manoeuvre along a line toward the target and then drop the bombs at the instant they are that distance, the range, from the target. The location at that instant is known as the drop point. Simple trigonometry can calculate the angle that the target would appear at when the aircraft was at the drop point. This is known as the range angle or <b>drop</b> <b>angle,</b> and was typically looked up from a set of pre-computed tables or using a simple mechanical calculator. The bombsight is then set to that angle, and the bomb aimer drops the bombs when the target passes through the sights.|$|E
