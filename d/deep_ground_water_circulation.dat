Located on the northwestern border of the Inle lake basin, the Khaung Daing hot spring outflows at a temperature of about 70 ̊C.

The hot spring isotopic composition falls close to the Yangon Meteoric Water Line, indicating that, despite its temperature, it is not strongly modified by water-rock interaction processes.

25|$|Groundwater: The water {{emerging}} from some <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> may have fallen as rain many tens, hundreds, {{or thousands of}} years ago. Soil and rock layers naturally filter the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> to {{a high degree of}} clarity and often, it does not require additional treatment besides adding chlorine or chloramines as secondary disinfectants. Such water may emerge as springs, artesian springs, or may be extracted from boreholes or wells. <b>Deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is generally of very high bacteriological quality (i.e., pathogenic bacteria or the pathogenic protozoa are typically absent), but the water may be rich in dissolved solids, especially carbonates and sulfates of calcium and magnesium. Depending on the strata through which the water has flowed, other ions may also be present including chloride, and bicarbonate. There may be a requirement to reduce the iron or manganese content of this water to make it acceptable for drinking, cooking, and laundry use. Primary disinfection may also be required. Where groundwater recharge is practiced (a process in which river water is injected into an aquifer to store the water in times of plenty so that it is available in times of drought), the groundwater may require additional treatment depending on applicable state and federal regulations.|$|R

The measurements demonstrate {{the significance of these}} <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge components for <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> flow systems in fractured granites of a high alpine catchment in the Central Alps, Switzerland. Hydrochemical and in situ parameters, as well as δ 18 O in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> samples collected in the tunnel, show only small temporal variations. The precipitation record of δ 18 O shows seasonal variations of ~ 14 ‰ and a decrease of 0. 23 ‰ ± 0. 03 ‰ per 100 m elevation gain. δ 2 H and δ 18 O in precipitation are well correlated and plot close to the meteoric water line, as well as δ 2 H and δ 18 O in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> samples, reflecting the meteoric origin of the latter. The depletion of 18 O in <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> compared to 18 O content in precipitation during the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge period indicates significant contributions from accumulated depleted winter precipitation to <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> recharge. The hydrochemical composition of the encountered <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> Na-Ca-HCO 3 -SO 4 (-F), reflects an evolution of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> along the flowpath through the granite body.

Shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> in this region is in close communication with the surface water, and a major problem with both systems is salinity.

40|$|The {{discharges}} of 43 {{springs in}} southeastern Cache Valley were measured monthly from May or June of 2005 through March of 2006. Water samples from 36 of these springs plus an additional 10 were analyzed for major ions and trace metals. Twenty-one of the springs were analyzed for deuterium and oxygen- 18 and 10 {{of these were}} analyzed for tritium. Six potential sources of recharge to the springs were identified: (1) shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> (2) <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> (3) river water, (4) canal water, (5) excess irrigation water, and (6) precipitation. The springs were divided into groups based on when they had their peak discharges. Six springs had peak discharges in the spring, suggesting they are recharged by precipitation. Eleven had peak discharges in the summer months, suggesting they are recharged by canal and/or excess irrigation water. Another 13 had peak discharges during the winter, suggesting they are recharged by rivers and/or <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water.</b> The last 13 springs had peak discharges during multiple seasons, suggesting they have multiple recharge sources. Spring water is characterized by calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate, similar to <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> and river water. However, of the 21 spring samples analyzed for deuterium and oxygen- 18, ten are most similar to canal water, six are most similar to wells completed into the deep aquifer system, suggesting that both the springs and the wells are recharged by rivers, three are most similar to river water, one is most similar to precipitation, {{and the last one}} is more negative (heavier) than any sample in this or previously published studies. In addition, four springs have high chloride concentrations, most likely from road de-icer suggesting they are recharged at least in part by precipitation, three springs have high concentrations of silica, two of which are known to be bedrock springs, and five springs have high sulfate concentrations due to their proximity to the Blacksmith Fork River. Of the 53 springs that had their discharges monitored and/or for which water samples were collected and analyzed, 23 appear to be recharged primarily by rivers, 21 probably are recharged mainly by canal and/or excess irrigation water, five gain water from multiple sources, two are bedrock springs, and the most likely source(s) of recharge could not be determined for the last two. The implications of these results include: (1) increased pumping from the deep aquifer system should not directly affect spring discharges, (2) drought conditions would likely decrease the discharges of springs recharged primarily by rivers, and (3) changes in land use may alter spring discharges...|$|R

The generation of new cracks might not unreasonably be assumed to precede major earthquakes.

40|$|Discharge {{monitoring}} and water sampling of springs {{in the southeastern}} portion of Cache Valley, Utah was performed {{in order to determine}} recharge sources and the cause of decreasing flows for some springs. The discharges of 43 springs were measured monthly from May or June of 2005 through March of 2006. Water samples from 36 of these springs plus an additional 10 were analyzed for major ions and trace metals. Twenty-one of the springs were analyzed for deuterium and oxygen- 18 and 10 of these were analyzed for tritium. The springs were divided into groups based on when they had their peak discharge. Peak discharges in the summer months suggest recharge from excess irrigation water and/or canal water, whereas peak discharges in winter months suggest recharge from rivers, and peak discharges in spring months suggest recharge by precipitation and/or river water recharge. Multiple discharge peaks suggest multiple recharge sources. The chemical data collected in the study were compared with data from previous investigations to determine potential spring sources, including: shallow <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> irrigation (river/canal) water, and precipitation. Spring water is characterized by calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate, similar to <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> and river water. However, most of the 21 springs analyzed for deuterium and oxygen- 18 displayed an evaporative signature; thus, chemically, the shallow, unconfined aquifer that recharges these springs appears to be recharged in part by excess irrigation water and/or canal water. Several of the springs have high chloride levels indicating the shallow, unconfined aquifer recharging those springs has surface runoff infiltrating into it. Because of the evaporative signature in the stable isotopes, the similarity of major ion and trace metal values, and the discharge trends observed throughout the year, it seems unlikely that the springs are directly connected hydraulically with the deep, confined aquifer, from which most of the wells in the valley withdraw their water. Thus, the recent drought, rather than increased pumping, probably has been responsible for decreases in spring discharges...|$|R

In this report the possible occurrence of pesticides in the upper (1 m) layer of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> and the <b>deep,</b> extracted <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> has been evaluated based on the actual use of soil and pesticides in a number of vulnerable agricultural areas in the Netherlands. Dilution, defined as the physical process of mixing of water streams in the extraction well, is determined by two factors: the actual use of a pesticide and the acreage fractions of the crops to which a pesticide may be applied. In case of public drinking water supplies the dilution factor, defined as the ratio of the pesticide concentration in the upper (1 m) layer of the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> and that in the <b>deep,</b> extracted <b>ground</b> <b>water,</b> has a minimum value of 3. 7 for pesticides which leaks into the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> with resulting concentrations higher than 0. 1 mg. m - 3. This dilution factor can be much higher for the various combinations of pesticide and crops. This dilution cannot prevent that the EC standard (for all pesticides together) of 0. 5 mg. m - 3 in the extracted <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is exceeded (by factors of 10 to 1000) and that for 13 of the 130 pesticides evaluated the individual EC standard of 0. 1 mg. m - 3 is exceeded. For private water extraction wells the situation may be somewhere between two extremes: no dilution (in case of very shallow extractions) or dilutions comparable to those of a public drinking water supply. It was concluded that degradation of the pesticides in the saturated zone may have a substantial effect on the concentrations in the extracted groundwater. The extent is determined by the relation between the residence time in this zone and the degradation rate of the pesticide in this zone. Only very limited information is available on the transformation of pesticides in the water satured zone and a reasonable certainty about the formation of harmless metabolites does not exist. Therefore the influence of transformation in the subsoil on the levels of pesticides in <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> has not been evaluated.

Other <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> aquifers may be developed to supply an additional resource to fulfill agricultural needs. Water quality analysis indicates that corrosion {{should not be a}} problem other than perhaps steady corrosion when the wells are closed. Considering the total dissolved solids and other criteria, water quality can be classified as good for irrigation. Water temperatures can be lowered by cooling ponds or cooling towers. An unlined cooling pond is less expensive than a cooling tower, but requires higher water consumption. Therefore, based on design assumptions, a mechanical draught tower may be considered more efficient than a cooling pond...|$|R
40|$|The hydrogeological {{system of}} an ecologically {{sensitive}} alpine floodplain in the Valle di Blenio, Switzerland, was investigated using hydrochemical and 3 H- 3 He dating methods. Water samples from six wells and from different surface locations were ana-lyzed. The {{analysis of the}} concentrations of major ions in conjunction with age determination by the 3 H- 3 He-method allowed the main hydrological properties of the system to be consistently characterized. Two geochemically distinct water zones can be dis-tinguished: Ca-SO 4 -dominated water from the main river and Ca-HCO 3 -dominated floodplain water. The floodplain water component characterizes the whole floodplain including the surficial hillslope drainage system. Within the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> samples, two spatially and temporally different types of water can be determined. A younger (age < 1. 5 years), less mineralized water {{is found in the}} upper part of the aquifer during the summer season. The underlying aquifer zone contains older and more highly miner-alized water. However, the general hydrochemical characterization of both types of <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> is similar. In winter, the water ages increase with decreasing <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> levels. Because precipitation is stored temporarily in the snow cover, the contribution of the younger near-surface <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> decreases, resulting in higher apparent water ages and higher mineralization in the upper zone of the aquifer. Water exchange between the main river and the <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> system is limited to <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> exfiltration from the shallow aquifer zone, whereas the hydrochemical separation of the deeper aquifer zone indicates the isolation of the <b>deeper</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water</b> from the main river...|$|R
40|$|With {{the recent}} extreme drought that Southern California is facing, many plants’ {{survivability}} adaptations have proven insufficient. The Malosma laurina plant {{is known for}} it’s incredible ability to survive through droughts and wildfires with it’s adaptations of resprouts regeneration and it’s roots that can reach a depth of 40 feet to gather <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>waters.</b> We theorized that the mechanical strength of the leaves directly relates to its survivability during droughts. To explore this theory we took focused our theory specifically on M. laurina resprouts. With two groups, one fully alive and one dying, we took six samples from six plants within each group, {{for a total of}} twelve total plants and seventy-two leaf samples. We predicted that the alive plants, that are able to endure the drought, will have a higher mechanical strength due to the water filled cells within the leaf. We expected our results to conclude that plants that are healthier and better hydrated shall have a greater mechanical strength than those of poorer health and lower hydration...|$|R
40|$|Alkali {{metals in}} lake, pond, and ice {{samples of the}} McMurdo Dry Valleys in {{southern}} Victoria Land, Antarctica were studied to clarify the origins of dissolved salts and to estimate their evolutional history. The contents of Li, Rb and Cs largely varied ranging from 0. 30 ppb to 390 ppm, 0. 06 ppb to 514 ppb and 0. 001 ppb to 90. 9 ppb, respectively. The low rare alkali metal contents with high Ef_m [Ef_m=(m/Cl) _s/(m/Cl) _, m; alkali metal, s; sample, sw; seawater] values of the pond waters and ice samples in the Labyrinth imply that dissolved salts are mainly derived from atmospheric fallout. The decrease of Ef_m values with increasing Cl content of the Labyrinth pond waters suggests that rare alkali metals are removed from waters during freeze and evaporative concentrations. The bottom waters of Lakes Fryxell and Bonney may originate from trapped seawater influenced by water-rock interaction. The extremely high Ef_m values (especially the Ef_, Ef_ values) of Don Juan Pond water and the bottom water in Lake Vanda {{can be explained by}} the contribution of <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R
40|$|Helicobacter pylori can infect {{the human}} stomach through the {{ingestion}} of water. Only {{a few studies}} on the morphological changes and viability of this bacteria in DGW (<b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>water)</b> have been reported and none in natural seawater (SW). Morphological changes and the culturability of H. pylori after storage in DGW or SW for a week were examined {{to see if they}} could be a factor associated with the high infection rate in Japan. An H. pylori strain, ATCC 43504, stored in DGW and in SW at 4 degrees C for 7 days, was examined daily for any ultrastructural changes and culturability. The same H. pylori strain was also cultured in conventional Brucella broth culture liquid medium as control and was similarly observed. Bacteria kept in DGW and SW were found not only to retain their spiral form but also to show better culturability than those kept in the control nutrient-rich medium (p < 0. 01). Thus, natural waters were found to be more conducive to H. pylori survival than a nutrient-rich medium...|$|R
40|$|This {{summary of}} the state of the {{knowledge}} related to nutrient effects on spring ecosystems and biota draws from the proceeding seven chapters of this report. It represents a synthesis of the most important findings; greater details can be found within each of the chapters. This synthesis chapter is organized into three parts: 1) a {{summary of the}} “knowns ” regarding nutrient effects on springs and spring biota, 2) the unknowns and suggestions for future research, and 3) suggestions for a research and adaptive management program for spring ecosystems in Florida. Florida springs are undergoing change. It is clear that nutrient loads within springsheds, particularly nitrate-N, from anthropogenic sources are increasing. These loads have apparently increased the quantities of nitrogen in shallow and <b>deep</b> <b>ground</b> <b>waters.</b> Nitrogen, but not phosphorus, concentrations in the discharges of many springs have increased in the past several decades. There are numerous other biotic and abiotic factors that have also changed in some, but not all springs, such as increased recreational use, decreased discharges, decreased O 2 concentrations in discharges, increased aquatic weed control, invasive species, and increase...|$|R
