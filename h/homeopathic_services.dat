A closed questionnaire was applied to 102 users during the month of January of 2007. It was found that the Homeopathy user uses other therapeutic resources concomitantly, mainly the conventional treatment (59, 7 %). The safety of the homeopathic treatment was invoked as the main motivation for its use (33, 1 %). The user rarely seeks the pharmacist’s advice, and when he/she does it is to ask orientations for self-medication. It is presented a short analysis of the emergency of pharmaceutical care in Brazil and the world and of the importance of systematization in the <b>homeopathic</b> specialized <b>services.</b> </p...|$|R

50|$|Naturopathic {{services}} {{are covered in}} some cases, but <b>homeopathic</b> <b>services</b> are generally not covered. Chiropractic is partially covered in some provinces. Cosmetic procedures are not typically covered. Psychiatric services (provided by physicians) are covered, fee-for-service psychology services outside of hospitals or community based mental health clinics are usually not. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, nursing, and chiropractic {{services are}} often not covered unless within hospitals. Some provinces, including Ontario include some rehabilitation services {{for those in the}} home care program, those recently discharged from hospitals (e.g., after a hip replacement), or those in particular age categories. Again, considerable variation exists, and provinces can (and do) alter their coverage decisions.|$|E

40|$|Homeopathy is {{one among}} the popular medical systems in India. Over the years, the {{government}} has been attempting to mainstream homeopathy in the public health system, nevertheless, most service providers are in the private sector. Therefore, increase of quality and availability to all population classes by means of public-private partnerships is seen as a viable policy option. In Delhi, 90 % of <b>homeopathic</b> <b>services</b> providers belong to the private sector, including charity trusts. Most of them provide services to the low-income population in urban slams. In 2003, Delhi government launched a program involving the private sector to provide <b>homeopathic</b> <b>services</b> in underserved city areas. This project funded private agencies to run homeopathic clinics. This paper provides an overview on this program, addressing in particular the lessons taught by six case studies represented by non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It also discusses expectations of private providers and concludes with specific recommendations for wider participation of the private sector...|$|E
40|$|There is {{demand for}} {{homeopathy}} in England amongst both doctors and patients. Exploring this demand remains {{the key to}} understanding the extent of integration of homeopathy in Primary and Secondary Care Practice and the potential significance of the role of GPs as gatekeepers. This thesis explores how qualified General Practitioners (GPs) and Medical Homeopathic Physicians in England adopt homeopathy as a healthcare innovation, and employ and integrate homeopathy treatments in their everyday work within healthcare practice in England. This study was conducted prior to the large scale changes that were introduced by NHS Mobilisation June 2010, championing the spread of activity to support the cost and quality agenda across the NHS, captured in the Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) goals, during the period covered by this study. The term, “integrative medicine” has become a common term to describe teams of health care providers working together to provide patient care. It is currently used interchangeably with complementary and alternative medicine, and at other times refers to treatments that combine conventional medicine and alternative modalities. The aim of this thesis is to determine how homeopathy is integrated into healthcare, its clinical and practice benefits and how GP/Medical Homeopath Physicians’ views and experiences effect integration. This two phase study, using an adapted General Practice Assessment Questionnaire (GPAQ), to audit patient satisfaction, explored patient experiences of available <b>homeopathic</b> <b>services</b> in two established Primary Care GP Practices between 2007 and 2008 and further explored in 2009 twenty General Practitioners and Medical Homeopathic Physicians views of the integration of homeopathy, through semi structured telephone interviews. The findings in Phase One confirm that homeopathy has been integrated to a degree within the National Health System (NHS) in England since its inception in 1948. Two Geographical Information Systems Maps utilised in this study identified and illustrated the locality of GP homeopaths in England and explored geographical demographics associated with homeopathy availability and use. A clinical audit of two established homeopathy services report patients satisfaction with the <b>homeopathic</b> <b>services</b> provided in Primary Care settings. Phase Two findings identified that Non-Homeopath GPs were not antagonistic about the use of homeopathy in Primary Care practice. Constraints against full integration of homeopathy were not specifically related to gate keeping but those predominately of the time necessary to fit in homeopathic consultations within regular patient consultation time. This is coupled with findings from the Medical Homeopathic Physicians that indicate it is not the future of homeopathy that is in question but that of the NHS itself...|$|E
40|$|The social {{determinants}} of the healthdisease {{process and the}} challenge of comprehensive care have led the World Health Organization to propose Complementary and Alternative Medicines to be included in health policies. In Brazil in 2006 the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) was published. It is a tool for the institutionalization of homeopathy in the Unified Health System (SUS). This paper analyzes the knowledge of health managers of municipalities of São Paulo on PNPIC, and its influence on homeopathic care. In 2008, the municipalities that performed homeopathic consultations from 2000 to 2007 were identified in DATA SUS, managers were interviewed and the results were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively: of the 645 municipalities, 47 had offered homeopathy and 42 of them were interviewed. Of these, 26 % knew about PNPIC, 31 % knew little, 41 % were unaware of it. It should be stressed that those aware of it stated that they use PNPIC to: instruct the local government about homeopathy; the construction of specific legislation and the increase in <b>homeopathic</b> <b>services.</b> The conclusion is that PNPIC is unknown by health managers and those that know it use it to make known the homeopathic medical rationale and justify its application in the SUS...|$|E
40|$|Os determinantes sociais do processo saúde-doença e o desafio da integralidade do cuidado levaram a Organização Mundial da Saúde a propor as Medicinas Alternativas e Complementares para comporem as políticas de saúde. No Brasil, em 2006 foi publicada a Política Nacional de Práticas Integrativas e Complementares (PNPIC); ferramenta para a institucionalização da homeopatia no Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS). Este trabalho analisa o conhecimento dos gestores da saúde de municípios de São Paulo sobre a PNPIC e sua influência na atenção em homeopatia. Em 2008 foram identificados no Datasus os municípios que realizaram consultas homeopáticas entre 2000 - 2007, os gestores foram entrevistados e os resultados analisados quanti-qualitativamente: dos 645 municípios, 47 ofertaram homeopatia e com 42 foram {{realizadas}} entrevistas. Desses, 26 % conhecem a PNPIC, 31 % a conhecem pouco e 41 % a desconhecem. Destaca-se que aqueles conhecedores afirmaram utilizar a PNPIC para: instruir o governo municipal sobre a homeopatia; a construção de legislação própria e o incremento dos serviços homeopáticos. Conclui-se que a PNPIC é desconhecida pelos gestores da saúde e aqueles que a conhecem utilizam-na para tornar conhecida a racionalidade médica homeopática e justificar sua indicação no SUS.

40|$|Pharmaceutical care is {{a concept}} already well established, but its {{application}} presents difficulties in homeopathy since homeopathic medicines have no the same indications as traditional drug classes. In recent decades the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacy presented a major development {{in the area of}} Pharmacotechnics, exemplified by the creation of local and national associations, the publication of technical texts and the fact that homeopathic medicines are, almost entirely, manipulated in pharmacies. It is also important to develop a pharmaceutical care in homeopathy, optimizing the activities of the medical homeopath and extending the service to the population. For two years, in a medical education and clinical service conducted at the Medical Faculty of JundiaÃƒÂ­, and supported by the Public Medical Service (SUS), three pharmacists and one pharmacy student, were responsible for pre and post consultation and dispensing of medicines. The objectives of this paper are to document the activities of pharmaceutical care, in order to encourage the activities of pharmacists in homeopathy. We developed a form for interviews as a pre-consultations. In the first consultation, it was used to record the identification data of the patient, the symptoms that brought him to the consultation, information about the presence of several physicians in the consultation and about the homeopathic treatment. In subsequent consultations, it was used to investigate the changes that have occurred since the last visit to the service. In post-consultation, the dispensation of the medication was done, with information about its use and conservation. The forms were given to the physicians and kept for future reference along with the clinical records of patients. As a result there was a positive reaction on the part of patients, probably because they felt more confident and instructed about the homeopathic treatment. The physicians referred in a positive manner about the help of pharmacists. Pharmacists have the opportunity to closely follow the changes in the health of patients, verifying the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment. The relationship between doctors and pharmacists developed in a positive way. Unfortunately, despite numerous cases of improvement of patients' symptoms, as well as its appreciation for homeopathic care, homeopathic service ended abruptly {{in the first half of}} 2011 due to lack of support from the Medical Faculty and public health service of that municipality, demonstrating once again the fragility of <b>homeopathic</b> <b>services...</b>|$|E
40|$|Since its {{introduction}} in Brazil in 1843, Homeopathy has presented a unique history with improvements and setbacks. In 2006 the Brazilian Ministry of Health finally introduces the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC, in Portuguese), {{a set of}} guidelines aiming to standardize and formalize the practices of Homeopathy, Acupuncture, Herbal Medicine, Hydrotherapy and Anthroposophy offered by the National Health System (SUS, in Portuguese). The {{aim of this study}} is to understand the impacts of those guidelines, already in process of consolidation, on Homeopathy service offered by SUS. This is a qualitative study that used the methodological framework of Content Analysis and collected data between 2012 and 2013 through the application of recorded semi-structured interviews that were later fully transcribed and analyzed. Those interviews were conducted with medical coordinator and/or managers of seven Homeopathy Services located in Southeastern Brazil. The analysis of the interviews unveiled themes relating to the formulated questions, revealing perceptions about the impact of each one of the seven PNPIC guidelines related to the homeopathic area. It is possible to observe that, given the peculiar process of construction and structuring of SUS <b>Homeopathic</b> <b>Services</b> both progress and stagnation could be perceived after the introduction of PNPIC. Established goals, formatted templates, guiding actions, publicity and some specific events could be mentioned as some of PNPIC's sensed benefits. On the other hand, it's surprising how it also created frustrated expectations regarding unreleased funding on already established Homeopathy services. Operational barriers can also be perceived, such as: implementation and development of homeopathic care services being still influenced by its managers' personal beliefs; restrict access to homeopathic medicine within the public healthy system; insufficient homeopathy professional [...] . Desde sua introdução no Brasil, em 1843, a Homeopatia apresenta uma história peculiar, com avanços e retrocessos no cenário nacional, até que, em 2006, é implantada, pelo Ministério da Saúde do Brasil, a Política Nacional de Práticas Integrativas e Complementares (PNPIC), sendo regida por diretrizes para normatizar e oficializar a prática da Homeopatia, Acupuntura, Fitoterapia, Termalismo e Antroposofia no Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS). Este estudo teve como objetivo compreender o impacto destas diretrizes propostas pela PNPIC em Serviços de Homeopatia do SUS, que já caminhavam em seu processo de consolidação. Tratase de um estudo de abordagem qualitativa, que utilizou o referencial metodológico da Análise de Conteúdo. A coleta dos dados se deu por meio da aplicação de entrevistas semiestruturadas gravadas em áudio e transcritas na íntegra no período entre 2012 e 2013. Foram entrevistados médicos homeopatas coordenadores ou gestores de sete Serviços de Homeopatia da região Sudeste do Brasil. A análise das entrevistas desvelou categorias temáticas referentes às questões formuladas, descortinando as percepções sobre o impacto de cada uma das sete diretrizes, próprias da área homeopática da PNPIC. Pode-se observar que avanços e estagnações foram percebidos após a introdução da PNPIC. Alguns ganhos foram percebidos, como criação de metas, moldes, ações norteadoras, divulgação e eventos específicos. No entanto, chama atenção como a PNIPIC criou uma expectativa nos serviços de Homeopatia já instituídos em relação a financiamentos que não vieram a ocorrer. Obstáculos de ordem operacional ainda se apresentam, como: implantação e ampliação de oferta de atendimento homeopático ainda mostrarem-se dependentes de desejos pessoais de gestores; dificuldade de acesso aos medicamentos homeopáticos na rede pública; pouca oferta de ensino e formação de profissionais homeopatas; pouco [...] ...|$|E
