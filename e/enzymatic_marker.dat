40|$|The {{last year}} we {{fabricated}} some new immunosensors {{for the analysis of}} lactoferrin protein. In the present research the immunological and analytical characteristics of the immunosensor method have been extensively investigated. The study was therefore extended to cover the ability of the analyte and the corresponding antibody to produce the immunocomplex. A rough estimation of the K(aff) value was obtained at the midpoint of the Langmuir curve, where K(aff) = 1 /IC(50). The K(aff) value was found to be of the order of 10 (6) M(- 1). In addition we attempted in the present study to reduce the excessively long time required for each measurement, due to the fact that, in the previous researches the measurement procedure used was the classic "competition" ELISA type, employing an ad hoc <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker.</b> One possible way of reducing measurement time was found to be to perform a kind of completely innovative "direct" measurement developed by us, which still uses an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker</b> and an amperometric transducer, as in the previous competition method.

40|$|Modifications of {{standard}} dot-blot immunoassay techniques {{have been made}} for the quantitation of integral membrane protein antigens. The modification involves the signal development step, which is performed by using punched-out wells of the solid support (nitrocellulose) to yield a soluble colored reaction product. This approach avoids the inhomogeneity of an insoluble reaction product and the subsequent quantitation problems encountered when such product is scanned by densitometry. The method was validated by comparing the purification and overall recoveries of a known plasma membrane <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker</b> with integral membrane antigens of defined localization during subcellular fractionation of mouse pancreas. The final plasma membrane fraction contained both basolateral (~ 20 -fold enriched) and apical membrane (~ 4 -fold enriched) domains...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years we {{fabricated}} several competitive immunosensors for the analysis of IgG proteins [1 - 4]. In the present study, to reduce the excessively long time required for each competition measurement, we developed an innovative “direct” immunosensor method for IgG determination. Of course other immunosensors for the direct measurement of several different antigens have already been described in the literature [5 - 7]; these devices usually do not involve any “competition” procedure and generally do not make use of a marker, because in these probes the signal is often obtained directly as a result of immunocomplex formation (which may, for example, be a cause of potential variation in the membrane). Usually these devices have not been very successful for various reasons (poor repeatability and scarce selectivity) even though they afford a considerable reduction in analysis time. Nevertheless, we recently resumed studies on direct immunosensors types as part of research conducted on new electrochemical immunosensors developed for the analysis of other proteins [8] and designed to perform a “competition free” measurement using different operating schemes. In the latter case, however, unlike what is usually reported in the literature for this kind of immunosensors (i. e. “Label Free” measurement), an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker</b> was again used to perform a “not Label Free” electrochemical measurement, while the transducer used was of the classic amperometric type [8]. In the present research slightly different approach was used for the measurement of IgG although of the same kind, while the electrochemical transducer was of the potentiometric type. The following conclusions may be drawn: direct amperometric immunosensor methods of this kind, in which no competitive step is thus envisaged, but which however still use an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker,</b> are as sufficiently precise, robust and reliable as the corresponding competition methods. Moreover, they have the additional advantage of taking half the analysis time and furthermore do not display the drawbacks of poor selectivity and precision often found in several direct potentiometric methods reported in literature, which do not use an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker,</b> as the signal is produced directly {{as a result of the}} antibody complex formation. Of course also the affinity constant value was evaluated, which resulted of the order of 107 M- 1. Lastly some applications to real matrices, i. e. human serum and milk, were performed using the new direct immunodevice. Results were compared with those obtained by applying, to the same samples, also a classical competitive immunosensor method previously developed by the present authors. Correlation between two immunosensor methods was satisfactory...|$|E

Moreover, a direct and positive correlation was found in the whole population studied between spermatozoa motility and all the mito-chondrial respiratory complex activities assayed (I, II, I 1 III, II 1 III, and IV).

40|$|The {{effect of}} LiCl on {{melanoma}} cell growth and differentiation was studied in mouse and human melanoma cell lines. LiCl markedly inhibited B 16 and HT- 144 melanoma cell growth in vitro. Clonogenicity in soft agar of the melanoma cells was also markedly inhibited by LiCl. Pretreatment of B 16 mouse melanoma cells with LiCl delayed {{the appearance of}} melanoma tumours in syngeneic mice. Growth inhibition of cells was accompanied by morphological and biochemical alterations. LiCl induced cell enlargement and formation of dendrite-like structures. The activity of NADPH cytochrome c reductase, an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker</b> of endoplasmic reticulum was significantly (2 - 3 fold) increased. Addition of myo-inositol to cell cultures partially reversed the anti-proliferative and morphological effects of LiCl on melanoma cells. This finding may suggest that the anti-proliferative effect of LiCl is related to its effect on phosphatidylinositol metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of the UPS locus encoding uroporphyrinogen I synthase has been investigated in human/mouse somatic cell hybrids. Human and mouse uroporphyrinogen I synthase can be readily distinguished by their isoelectric points. In hybrid cells, both human and mouse isozymes are detected. The multiple human uroporphyrinogen I synthase isozymes segregate as a single unit, as expected if they are the products of a single locus. The absence of new heteropolymers in hybrid cells supports the biochemical evidence that the active enzyme is a monomer. The presence of human uroporphyrinogen I synthase in hybrid clones was correlated {{with the presence of}} human chromosome 11, or its <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker,</b> without exception in 44 independent hybrid lines. All other chromosomes could be eliminated as possible locations for this locus, due to their independent segregation.

Expression of a monocyte/granulocyte cell surface antigen also occurred only when cells {{were treated with}} both agents. Similar effects were seen with other active but not inactive phorbol esters and with another Ca 2 + ionophore.

40|$|Long term {{exposure}} to a reduced gravitational environment has a deleterious effect on bone. The developmental events which occur prior to initial bone deposition will {{provide insight into the}} regulation of mature bone physiology. We have characterized a system in which the events preceding bone formation take place in an isolated in vitro organ culture environment. We show that cultured pre-metatarsal tissue parallels development of pre-metatarsal tissue in the embryo. Both undergo mesenchyme differentiation and morphogenesis to form a cartilage rod, which resembles the future bone, followed by terminal chondrocyte differentiation in a definite morphogenetic pattern. These sequential steps occur prior to osteoblast maturation and bone matrix deposition in the developing organism. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity is a distinctive <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker</b> for mineralizing tissues. We have measured this activity throughout pre-metatarsal development and show (a) where in the tissue it is predominantly found, and (b) that this is indeed the mineralizing isoform of the enzyme...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Supernatants of rat {{skeletal}} muscle homogenates were fractionated by differential centrifugation and by zonal centrifugation in sucrose density gradients. Cytochrome oxidase was employed as an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker</b> for locating mitochondria. The subcellular fractions were also assayed {{for their ability}} to prevent the ATP-induced contraction of myofibrils. Both the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions obtained by differential fractionation were found to be rich in such relaxing activity, and the microsomal fraction was appreciably contaminated by mitochondria. In contrast to this, when fractionation was carried out by means of zonal centrifugation (4200 RPM X 205 min. to 40, 000 RPM X 60 min.), relaxing activity was found to be associated only with particles having the sedimentation characteristics of microsomes (s 20,, estimated to be between 370 and 1880 S). Relaxing activity was not detected in the regions of the gradient containing either the starting sample zone (soluble phase) or the mitochondrial peak. The microsomal relaxing particles showed negligible cytochrome oxidase activity...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine triphosphate-sulphurylase (ATPS) plays a {{major role}} in dissimilatory {{sulphate}} reduction. In this study, the level of ATPS activity was monitored in a time course study using a biosulphidogenic batch bioreactor system. A coincident decrease in ATPS activity with a decline in sulphate concentration and an increase in sulphide concentration as biosulphidogenesis proceeded was observed. Flask studies further showed sulphate to be stimulatory to ATPS, while sulphide proved to be inhibitory. The effect of ions (Ca^(2 +), Cl^(−), Fe^(2 +) and Zn^(2 +)) on the ATPS activity was also investigated. Most of the ions studied (Ca^(2 +), Cl^(−) and Fe^(2 +)) were stimulatory at lower concentrations (40 – 120 mg/l) but proved toxic at higher concentrations (> 120 mg/l). In contrast, Zn^(2 +) was inhibitory even at low concentrations (40 mg/l). ATPS may potentially be used as an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker</b> for biological sulphate reduction in sulphate-rich wastewaters and natural environments (anaerobic systems such as soils and sediments found in freshwater and marine systems), providing all residual sulphide and interfering ions are removed using a simple preparative step...|$|E

We evaluated a vaccination protocol {{based on}} intradermal priming with recombinant Cz and intranasal boosting with rCz co-administered with a derivative of the TLR 2 / 6 agonist MALP- 2. Vaccination triggered strong systemic and mucosal antibody responses, and a vigorous cell-mediated immunity characterized by lymphoproliferation, DTH reactivity and IFN-gamma production. The immune responses protected against a lethal trypomastigote challenge and, upon sub-lethal infection, immunized mice showed reduction of tissue damage and normal <b>enzymatic</b> <b>markers</b> of muscle injury.

40|$|Occurrence {{of liver}} gas {{embolism}} after rapid decompression was assessed in 31 female rats that were decompressed in 12 min after 42 min of compression at 7 ATA (protocol A). Sixteen rats died after decompression (group I). Of the surviving rats, seven were killed at 3 h (group II), and eight at 24 h (group III). In group I, bubbles were {{visible in the}} right heart, aortic arch, liver, and mesenteric veins and on the intestinal surface. Histology showed perilobular microcavities in sinusoids, interstitial spaces, and hepatocytes. In group II, liver gas was visible in two rats. Perilobular vacuolization and significant plasma aminotransferase increase were present. In group III, liver edema was evident at gross examination in all cases. Histology showed perilobular cell swelling, vacuolization, or hydropic degeneration. Compared with basal, <b>enzymatic</b> <b>markers</b> of liver damage increased significantly. An additional 14 rats were decompressed twice (protocol B). Overall mortality was 93 %. In addition to diffuse hydropic degeneration, centrilobular necrosis was frequently observed after the second decompression. Additionally, 10 rats were exposed to three decompression sessions (protocol C) with doubled decompression time. Their mortality rate decreased to 20 %, but <b>enzymatic</b> <b>markers</b> still increased in surviving rats compared with predecompression, and perilobular cell swelling and vacuolization were present in five rats. Study challenges were 1) liver {{is not part of}} the pathophysiology of decompression in the existing paradigm, and 2) although significant cellular necrosis was observed in few animals, zonal or diffuse hepatocellular damage associated with liver dysfunction was frequently demonstrated.

40|$|Two common non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) {{and their}} nitric oxide (NO) adducts were evaluated for effects on stomach and thymus. Following 4 -h duration (acute) oral dosing of fasted male Wistar rats, 1. 33 × 10 − 4 mol/kg of ibuprofen caused significant visual irritation score and microscopic thinning, although an ulceration assay proved insensitive. Ibuprofen esterified with NO abolished irritation and significantly reduced thinning. Gastro-protective effects of NO-linked ibuprofen {{were associated with}} higher levels of diaphorase by optical density, an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker</b> of local synthesis of nitric oxide. Both indomethacin and its congener at 2 × 10 − 5 mol/kg produced microscopic signs of thinning only, not visible irritation or alteration of diaphorase staining. Results suggest that NO-linked ibuprofen can promote resistance to mucosal injury, possibly via local synthesis of NO. All NO-congeners and parent NSAIDs produced comparable reductions in the abundance of medullary nitrergic cells, those synthesising NO in thymus, without significantly lowering T-cellularity, the relative size of cortex wherein T-cells are produced.

40|$|Intracistronic {{complementation}} of N-terminally truncated beta-galactosidase mutants such as M 15 by coexpressed alpha-peptide {{was originally}} discovered in Escherichia coli and exploited for plasmid cloning as the well-known blue-white screening method. We show here that alpha-complementation also {{works in the}} budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and {{that it can be}} used as a simple nonselective <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker</b> for a variety of in vivo studies, for example, on the role of molecular chaperones in protein folding and assembly. To be able to induce alpha-complementation post-translationally, we have constructed a hormone-inducible alpha-peptide by fusion of the DNA encoding the alpha-peptide to that of to the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor. The accumulation of both subunits, the alpha-peptide and M 15, is severely compromised when they are expressed separately, presumably because their hydrophobic surfaces remain exposed. Moreover, alpha-complementation is defective in a strain of S. cerevisiae carrying a point mutant of the molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90. Heat-shock protein 90, which coprecipitates with M 15, might be required in vivo to prevent the degradation of unassembled M 15 and to hold it in an interaction-competent conformation...|$|E
40|$|We have devised, in guinea pigs, an {{improved}} ATPase technique which enables one to proceed from light to electron microscope study while preserving, on the ultrastructural level, the various membranous structures, {{in particular the}} Langerhans cell (LC) granules. Using this method, {{we have been able}} to confirm the action of acute, low-dose UVB on the surface <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker,</b> ATPase. Moreover, this study has shown that the ATPase-negative LC contain abnormal LC granules or, more often, are deficient in LC granules. In a previous work, we have shown that, after epicutaneous application of a hapten, one successively observes an extensive adsorptive pinocytosis process, the disappearance of the membranous ATPase system, and the appearance of LC granules in the cytoplasm. Therefore we may suppose that, after UVB irradiation, the disappearance of the ATPase system and/or the possible alteration of the adsorptive pinocytosis process interrupts or alters the formation of LC granules. These successive events might play a vital role in the formation of the hapten-carrier protein-Ia antigen complex. In their absence in a large number of LC, following UV irradiation, epicutaneous application of a hapten would lead to the development of a state of immune tolerance...|$|E
40|$|The {{differentiation}} {{status of}} epithelial cells in intestinal adaptation remains unclear. To determine whether enterocytes reach optimum maturity following adaptation after 85 % shortening {{of the rat}} gut by jejunoileal bypass surgery, activities of two brush border <b>enzymatic</b> <b>markers</b> of differentiation, alkaline phosphatase and sucrase, were examined in subpopulations of epithelial cells isolated sequentially from the villus/crypt axis of normal (sham operated) and hyperplastic mucosa. In jejunal villi, adaptational hyperplasia was associated {{with an increase in}} total epithelial alkaline phosphatase, but not total sucrase, activity; alkaline phosphatase activity increased most obviously in cells at the 11 - 50 % position (from the tip) on villi. In hyperplastic ileal villi, total alkaline phosphatase activity fell, although sucrase activity did not change significantly. Specific activity (per mg protein) of sucrase on jejunal villus epithelium was reduced by the adaptational changes to bypass; alkaline phosphatase specific activity remained unchanged. In the ileum, despite adaptational changes to bypass, there was no increase in the normally low specific activities of sucrase and alkaline phosphatase. Bypass surgery did not change the major site of expression of either enzyme on jejunal or ileal villi. In conclusion, <b>enzymatic</b> <b>markers</b> of functional differentiation are not all equally affected by adaptational hyperplasia. Hypertrophy of villi and increased cell proliferation seen in jejunum remaining exposed to luminal contents resulted in an increase in the alkaline phosphatase but not the sucrase content. This is not, therefore, the result of a simple immaturity of villus cells. Morphological adaptation in the ileum, however, is not accompanied by adaptation of brush border enzyme markers of differentiation, confirming a functional immaturity of these cells. Strategies for increasing the expression of these markers may have clinical value...|$|R

Good agreemen samples with an <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker,</b> and thorium dioxide-labeled samples evaluated by stereology. The rate of usion as assayed by fluorescence was not affected by the number of particles ingested, serum concentration, or prior uptake of digestible or nondigestible substances.

Both the rate and extent of fusion were dramatically increased after several days in culture and similar changes were found by use of the EM assays.

The enzyme 20 -alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20 alpha SDH) {{was used as}} a marker to distinguish between various populations of activated thymocytes. Thymocytes that were selected in Con A + pure or crude IL- 2 expressed high 20 alpha SDH activity, while those that were selected in Con A + recombinant IL- 1 (rIL- 1) or crude IL- 1, or Con A + PMA expressed low 20 alpha SDH activity. Both groups proliferate in response to Con A and had IL- 2 receptors. After selection, the enzymatic phenotype was stable even if the cells were transferred from Con A + IL- 2 to Con A + PMA (or IL- 1) or vice versa. A third group was selected from thymocytes that were cultured in PMA + T cell growth factor (TCGF). This group expressed low levels of 20 alpha SDH, had IL- 2 receptors, but did not respond to Con A.

Preparation of membrane vesicles from superficial and deep cortex allowed us to image the different distributions of γglutamyl transferase in membrane vesicles from these areas.

C.  albicans cells proliferate in a planktonic (suspension) state, but they also form biofilms, organized and tightly packed communities of cells attached to a solid surface. Biofilms colonize many niches of the human body and persist on implanted medical devices, where they are a major source of new C.  albicans infections. Here, we used an unbiased and global substrate-profiling approach to discover proteolytic activities produced specifically by C.  albicans biofilms, compared to planktonic cells, with the goal of identifying potential biofilm-specific diagnostic markers and targets for therapeutic intervention. This activity-based profiling approach, coupled with proteomics, identified Sap 5 (Candidapepsin- 5) and Sap 6 (Candidapepsin- 6) as major biofilm-specific proteases secreted by C.  albicans. Fluorogenic peptide substrates with selectivity for Sap 5 or Sap 6 confirmed that their activities are highly upregulated in C.  albicans biofilms; we also show that these activities are upregulated in other Candida clade pathogens.

Mixed-cell aggregate cultures were treated continuously for 10 days between DIV 5 and 15. Parathion induced astrogliosis at concentration at which MAP- 2 immunostaining, found here to be more sensitive than neuron-specific enzyme activities, was not affected. In contrast, chlorpyrifos induced a comparatively weak gliotic reaction, and only at concentrations at which neurons were already affected. After similar treatments, increased neurotoxicity of parathion and chlorpyrifos was found in aggregate cultures deprived of glial cells. These results suggest that glial cells provide neuroprotection against OPs toxicity. To address the question of the difference in toxicity between parathion and chlorpyrifos, the toxic effects of their leaving groups, p-nitrophenol and trichloropyridinol, were studied in mixed-cell aggregates. General cytotoxicity was more pronounced for trichloropyridinol and both compounds had similar toxic effects on neuron-specific enzyme activities. In contrast, trichloropyridinol induced a much stronger decrease in glutamine synthetase activity, the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>marker</b> of astrocytes. Trichloropyridinol may exert a toxic effect on astrocytes, compromising their neuroprotective function, thus exacerbating the neurotoxicity of chlorpyrifos. This is in line with the suggestion that glial cells may contribute to OPs neurotoxicity, and with the view that OPs may exert their neurotoxic effects through different mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Nine natural {{populations of}} Moroccan Medicago truncatula were {{analysed}} using <b>enzymatic</b> <b>markers</b> to identify useful phytogenetic resources for their integration in programmes of safeguard and conservation. Starch gel electrophoresis {{was used to}} examine genetic variation within and among natural populations. According to our estimates of genetic variation analysed by five loci detected for three enzyme system, the species showed a high genetic diversity. 46 % of the total variation is due to the diversity between populations. It appears that a considerable variation was found among populations, indicating an interesting genetic potential for selection. This result is in accordance with the strictly autogamous system of reproduction in this species. The dendrogram generated from pairwise genetic distance among all populations showed three distinct clusters independently from the geographic origin. Conservation programs should take into account the level of genetic diversity within and between populations revealed by isozyme markers. Key words: Medicago truncatula Isozyme Genetic diversity Morocc...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of {{antioxidant}} {{potential of}} natural products against Aluminium fluoride (AlF 4) induced oxidative stress in albino mice were {{represented in the}} present study. Gossypin, Quercetin dehydrate, (-) -Epicatechin gallate, Gallic acid and Suramin sulphate (G-protein inhibitor) were evaluated for antioxidant activity by measuring various biochemical / <b>enzymatic</b> <b>markers</b> such as lipid peroxidation, glutathione, total thiols, catalase and superoxide dismutase. Exposure to Aluminium fluoride resulted in the oxidative stress and free radical mediated damage. The flavonoids like Gossypin, Quercetin, (-) -Epicatechin gallate, Gallic acid and Suramin sulphate are significantly reduced lipid peroxidation, reversed the reduced protective enzymes SOD,CAT and non-enzymatic like glutathione and total thiols levels were approached to normal levels in Aluminium fluoride exposed mice. All the test compounds were showed significant protection against fluoride toxicity. Results {{of the present study}} reveals that the flavonoids and Suramin sulphate showed significant antioxidant activity on Aluminium fluoride induced oxidative stress. Further research warranted to study their exact mechanism of action. Article History...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{carried out a}} {{detailed}} light microscopy investigation of the cytochemical properties of the haemocytes of the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, using new cytochemical stains and <b>enzymatic</b> <b>markers,</b> a panel of antibodies and lectins as probes to characterise Botryllus blood cells further. Results indicate that lymphocyte-like cells are circulating stem cells recognised by anti-CD 34 antibody and {{there are at least}} two defined haemocyte differentiation pathways: i) phagocytes, represented by hyaline amoebocytes and macrophage-like cells, which share similar staining properties, the same hydrolytic enzyme content as well as the presence of detectable cytochrome-c-oxidase activity, recognition by anti-CD 39 and Narcissus pseudonarcissus agglutinin; ii) cytotoxic cell line, represented by granular amoebocytes and morula cells which have vacuoles stained by Ehrlich’s stain and Neutral Red; DOPA-containing protein are present inside morula cell vacuoles. Pigment cells and nephrocytes are involved in catabolite storage but their relationships with other cell types are less clear...|$|R
