Michael {{initially}} tells the documentary crew that [...] "nothing happened", that they <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> for several hours, but his story gradually changes to imply that they did more than that.

500|$|Zero Hour (that is, {{the start}} of the attack) was first fixed for midnight 23 May. But it was delayed 24 hours because it had not been {{possible}} to gather troops and weapons in time. Because no reconnaissance patrol was made the Israelis didn't know the exact composition of enemy forces. Intelligence reports <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> about [...] "local irregular forces". On 24 May at 19:30, Shlomo Shamir was warned that an enemy force of around 120 vehicles, comprising armoured vehicles and artillery, was probably moving towards Latrun, urged an attack. The attack was postponed by 2 hours and fixed at 22:00. The attack was planned on two axes: ...|$|E

[...] That line was written by Harris Wittels, who wrote past screenplays for other Parks and Recreation episodes. During the end credits, Andy sings a song he wrote for April called [...] "November," [...] which includes the lyrics, [...] "Let's spread our wings and fly on a date." [...] This is also a reference to [...] "Woman of the Year," [...] in which Andy explained every song he writes includes either the lyrics, [...] "Spread your wings and fly" [...] or [...] "You deserve to be a champion." [...] Schur, who wrote the words to [...] "November", said it was especially challenging working one of those phrases into a love song.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} was featured entirely off {{screen in the}} first season, often as a [...] "disembodied voice". In July 2015, she was revealed to be physically appearing in the second season, and Verbeek was cast in the role by October 2015. Verbeek was in Europe when she auditioned for and got the part, and Agent Carter had not yet begun airing there, so Verbeek [...] "didn't really know anything. I <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> to the showrunners, what is it about, what is the character about." [...] Verbeek wanted to play more than just [...] "the wife of", and noted that her take on the character is [...] "somewhat unexpected with Jarvis being who he is ... Ana just brings a whole different dimension to him." [...] Verbeek, who is Dutch, has [...] "spent {{a lot of time}} in Budapest", which helped with the character's Hungarian accent.|$|E
500|$|The idea of reuniting with Nolan and Cooper {{was first}} {{proposed}} in January 2010, when Mark O'Connell suggested Lazzara talk with Nolan on the phone. Lazzara said: [...] "One day he [...] {{called me and}} was like, 'Hey, man, {{what do you think}} about us going back to our original lineup?' And I was like, 'Are you crazy? I haven't talked to John [...] in, like, seven years. I don't know if he'd want to do it.'" [...] O'Connell continued to insist on the idea, [...] "and then I got a call from John ... it felt like no time had passed ... like we had <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> a few days ago". The pair did not discuss creating music initially, instead [...] " [...] reacquainted with what had been going on in our lives. Because for me, I genuinely missed his friendship, and same with Shaun [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The opening {{episode of}} Sense and Sensibility {{features}} the moment Willoughby seduces Eliza, a young schoolgirl. Davies told Carey and Claire Hill from the Western Mail {{that he wanted}} [...] "to do justice" [...] to Willoughby's back story, {{saying that it is}} [...] "quite interesting and steamy stuff like a lot of underage sex that goes on and is <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> about. I want {{to put it on the}} screen." [...] Davies elaborated on this further in an interview with The Independent's Peter Chapman, saying that the seduction and abandonment of a schoolgirl in the novel needed dramatising. He believed readers [...] "hardly notice" [...] the moment, which he felt was very important. The writer noted that the series was [...] "more overtly sexual" [...] than previous adaptations of Austen's works and added, [...] "The novel is as much about sex and money as social conventions." [...] Davies also included a duel between Colonel Brandon and Willoughby in his screenplay, an event that was absent from Lee's film adaptation of the novel.|$|E

500|$|Gilbert and Winnick co-wrote and co-designed the project, {{but they}} worked {{separately}} as well: Gilbert on programming and Winnick on visuals. As {{both of them}} enjoyed B horror films, they {{decided to make a}} comedy-horror game set in a haunted house. They drew inspiration from a film whose name Winnick could not recall. He described it as [...] "a ridiculous teen horror movie", in which teenagers inside a building were killed one by one without any thought of leaving. This film, combined with clich√©s from popular horror movies such as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street, became the basis for the game's setting. Early work on the game progressed organically: according to Gilbert, [...] "Very little was written down. Gary and I <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> and laughed a lot, and out it came." [...] Lucasfilm Games relocated to the Stable House at Skywalker Ranch during Maniac Mansions conception period, and the ranch's Main House was used {{as a model for the}} mansion. Several rooms from the Main House received exact reproductions in the game, such as a library with a spiral staircase and a media room with a large-screen TV and grand piano.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} {{between the}} two also saw racial dust-ups caused by perceptions of remarks made by campaign surrogates. [...] In March 2008 Ferraro gave {{an interview with the}} Daily Breeze in which she said: [...] "If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position. And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept." [...] (Ferraro had made a similar comment in 1988 disparaging Jesse Jackson's candidacy in the party's presidential primaries, saying that because of his [...] "radical" [...] views, [...] "if Jesse Jackson were not black, he wouldn't be in the race.") Ferraro justified the statements by referring to her own run for vice president. Echoing a statement she wrote about herself in 1988, Ferraro said that [...] "I was talking about historic candidacies and what I started off by saying (was that) {{if you go back to}} 1984 and look at my historic candidacy, which I had <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> about all these things, in 1984, if my name was Gerard Ferraro instead of Geraldine Ferraro, I would have never been chosen as a vice-presidential candidate. It had nothing to do with my qualification." [...] Her comments resonated with some older white women, but generated an immediate backlash elsewhere. There was strong criticism and charges of racism from many supporters of Obama and Obama called them [...] "patently absurd". Clinton publicly expressed disagreement with Ferraro's remarks, while Ferraro vehemently denied she was a racist. Again speaking to the Breeze, Ferraro responded to the attacks by saying: [...] "I really think they're attacking me because I'm white. How's that?" [...] Ferraro resigned from Clinton's finance committee on , 2008, two days after the firestorm began, saying that she didn't want the Obama camp to use her comments to hurt Clinton's campaign.|$|E
500|$|On 14 July 1918, local priests at Yekaterinburg {{conducted}} a private church {{service for the}} family and reported that Tatiana and her family, contrary to custom, fell on their knees during the prayer for the dead. The final entry in Tatiana's final notebook at Yekaterinburg was a saying she had copied from {{the words of a}} well-known Russian Orthodox holy man, Father Ioann of Kronstadt: [...] "Your grief is indescribable, the Savior's grief in the Gardens of Gethsemane for the world's sins is immeasurable, join your grief to his, in it you will find consolation." [...] The following day, on 15 July, Tatiana and her sisters appeared in good spirits as they joked with one another and moved the beds in their room so visiting cleaning women could scrub the floor. They got down on their hands and knees to help the women and whispered to them when the guards weren't looking. All four young women wore long black skirts and white silk blouses, the same clothing they had worn the previous day. Their short hair was [...] "tumbled and disorderly." [...] They told the women how much they enjoyed physical exertion and wished there was more of it for them to do in the Ipatiev House. On the afternoon of 16 July 1918, the last full day of her life, Tatiana sat with her mother and read from the Biblical Books of Amos and Obadiah, Alexandra noted in her diary. Later, mother and daughter sat and <b>just</b> <b>talked.</b> As the family was having dinner that night, Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the detachment, came in and announced that the family's kitchen boy and Alexei's playmate, 14-year-old Leonid Sednev, must gather his things and go to a family member. The boy had actually been sent to a hotel across the street because the guards did not want to kill him {{along with the rest of}} the Romanov party. The family, unaware of the plan to kill them, was upset and unsettled by Sednev's absence. Tatiana went that evening to Yurovsky's office, for what was to be the last time, to ask for the return of the kitchen boy who kept Alexei amused during the long hours of captivity. Yurovsky placated her by telling her the boy would return soon, but the family was unconvinced.|$|E
