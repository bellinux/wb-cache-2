50|$|A biopsy is {{a medical}} test {{commonly}} performed by a surgeon, interventional radiologist, or an interventional cardiologist involving <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> cells or tissues for examination to determine the presence or extent of a disease. The tissue is generally examined under a microscope by a pathologist, and can also be analyzed chemically. When an entire lump or suspicious area is removed, the procedure is called an excisional biopsy. An incisional biopsy or core biopsy samples {{a portion of the}} abnormal tissue without attempting to remove the entire lesion or tumor. When a sample of tissue or fluid is removed with a needle {{in such a way that}} cells are removed without preserving the histological architecture of the tissue cells, the procedure is called a needle aspiration biopsy. Biopsies are most commonly performed for insight into possible cancerous and inflammatory conditions.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of expert}} systems to {{interpret}} short tandem repeat DNA profiles in forensic, medical and ancient DNA applications {{is becoming increasingly}} prevalent as high-throughput analytical systems generate large amounts of data that are time-consuming to process. With special reference to low copy number (LCN) applications, we use a graphical model to simulate stochastic variation associated with the entire DNA process starting with <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample,</b> followed by the processing associated with the preparation of a PCR reaction mixture and PCR itself. Each {{part of the process}} is modelled with input efficiency parameters. Then, the key output parameters that define the characteristics of a DNA profile are derived, namely heterozygote balance (Hb) and the probability of allelic drop-out p(D). The model can be used to estimate the unknown efficiency parameters, such as πextraction. ‘What-if’ scenarios can be used to improve and optimize the entire process, e. g. by increasing the aliquot forwarded to PCR, the improvement expected to a given DNA profile can be reliably predicted. We demonstrate that Hb and drop-out are mainly a function of stochastic effect of pre-PCR molecular selection.

The model explains many of the observed features not contained in the interface state model.

Oxide states are the dominant defects {{over a wide range}} of energy. The defect state densities are not subject to the usual resolution limits of conventional analyses. Using this approach, it is possible to characterize relatively rapidly a wide range of energies at a single temperature without the need for reaching the low or high limits of frequency. The implications for the conventional interface state density (Dit) extraction techniques are explored. It is shown how oxide states can affect the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> parameters, particularly the insulator capacitance, and can result in a range of extracted Dit values.

40|$|Gaharu or Agarwood is a {{resinous}} wood from aquilaria species, naturally grown in tropical forest. It is of high demand from various industries for it contains therapheutical essential oil {{commonly used in}} cosmetic industry, religious ceremony and traditional medicine. Due to its high demand and scarce in the forest, gaharu oil is highly priced. As of early 2010, gaharu oil in Malaysia is valued at RM 420 per tola (12 g). Hence, it is of great importance for an efficient method of extracting the oil to be developed. The conventional method of extraction currently practiced in the industry requires very long hours and produces low oil yield. The present study focused on developing pretreatment steps of conditioning the gaharu wood prior to extraction {{in order to enhance}} the extraction process. Preliminary experimental work showed that all pretreatment methods of gaharu wood examined in the study strongly influenced the oil yield during extraction. Four types of pretreatment methods were examined, namely soaking (typically used in industry), ultrasonication, enzymatic and combination of ultrasonication and enzymatic. From the study, combination of ultrasonication and enzymatic pretreatment method was found to give the highest oil yield (0. 1232 %), followed by ultrasonication (0. 1134 %), enzymatic (0. 1088 %) and soaking (0. 0734 %) respectively. In comparison to untreated sample, an improvement of 53. 57 % was achieved in the <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>sample</b> pretreated with combination of ultrasound and enzymatic. On the other hand, soaking technique improved the oil yield by 28. 32 %. In general, hydro distillation performed better than steam distillation for extraction of gaharu oil, with extraction yield increased up to 35 % {{due to the fact that}} hydro distillation provides continuous water phase within the solid structure as compared to steam distillation where not all solid surfaces are in contact with the passing steam. At optimum operating conditions, the highest oil yield from combination of ultrasonic and enzymatic pretreatment method was 0. 1692 %, at 9 hours pretreatment time, 1 : 16 w/v of sample to water ratio and 1. 5 : 100 v/w of enzyme to substrate ratio. Calculation of extraction rate constant (Ko) showed that Ko for the combination of ultrasonic and enzymatic pretreated sample was greater than the value for the conventional (soaking) pretreated sample, with value of 0. 45 and 0. 25 respectively. The increased of Ko value indicates greater driving force of mass transfer at the solid-liquid interface...|$|E
