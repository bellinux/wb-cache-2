5000|$|Disappointed by {{the poor}} results of the 917 in 1969, and facing new competition, Porsche {{concluded}} an agreement with John Wyer and his JWA Gulf Team, which became the official Porsche team, and also the official development partner. During tests at the Österreichring at Zeltweg, works drivers Redman and Ahrens tested the car, and the car still performed like it did before. The Österreichring was the circuit where the car had won its only race at that time, Wyer's chief engineer John Horsman noticed that the bodywork had a pattern of dead gnats dashed against it, revealing the airflow. The tail was clean—the lack of dead gnats indicated that the air was not flowing over the tail. A modification to the tail was cobbled-up on the spot in the pits with aluminium sheets taped together. This new short tail gave the 917 much needed downforce. The plastic engine <b>intake</b> <b>cover</b> had already been removed. Redman and Ahrens were doing only one lap at a time before, they each did 10 laps and {{were satisfied with the}} improved performance. The new version was called 917K (Kurzheck, or [...] "short tail").|$|E

50|$|On its bottom, the sump {{contains}} an oil <b>intake</b> <b>covered</b> by a mesh filter which {{is connected to}} an oil pump then to an oil filter outside the crankcase, from there it is diverted to the crankshaft main bearings and valve train. The crankcase contains at least one oil gallery (a conduit inside a crankcase wall) to which oil is introduced from the oil filter. The main bearings contain a groove through all or half its circumference; the oil enters to these grooves from channels connected to the oil gallery. The crankshaft has drillings which take oil from these grooves and deliver {{it to the big}} end bearings. All big end bearings are lubricated this way. A single main bearing may provide oil for 0, 1 or 2 big end bearings. A similar system may be used to lubricate the piston, its gudgeon pin and the small end of its connecting rod; in this system, the connecting rod big end has a groove around the crankshaft and a drilling connected to the groove which distributes oil from there {{to the bottom of the}} piston and from then to the cylinder.|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Multi-hour ski {{mountaineering}} {{energy balance}} may be negative and intake below recommendations. METHODS: Athletes on the 'Patrouille des Glaciers' racecourses (17 on course Z, 27  km, + 2, 113  m; 11 on course A, 26  km, + 1, 881  m) volunteered. Pre-race measurements included body mass, stature, VO 2 max, {{and heart rate}} (HR) vs VO 2 at simulated altitude; race measurements HR, altitude, incline, location, and food and drink intake (A). Energy expenditure (EE) was calculated from altitude corrected HR derived VO 2. RESULTS: Race time was 5  h 7  min ±  44  min (mean ± SD, Z) and 5  h 51  min ±  53  min (A). Subjects spent 19. 2  ±  3. 2  MJ (Z), respectively, 22. 6  ±  2. 9  MJ (A) during the race. Energy deficit was - 15. 5  ±  3. 9  MJ (A); <b>intake</b> <b>covered</b> 20  ±  7  % (A). Overall energy cost of locomotion (EC) was 9. 9  ±  1. 3  J m(- 1)  kg(- 1) (Z), 8. 0  ±  1. 0  J m(- 1)  kg(- 1) (A). Uphill EC was 11. 7  ±  1  J m(- 1)  kg(- 1) (Z, 13  % slope) and 15. 7  ±  2. 3  J m(- 1)  kg(- 1) (A, 19  % slope). Race A subjects lost - 1. 5  ±  1. 1  kg, indicating near euhydration. Age, body mass, gear mass, VO 2 max and EC were significantly correlated with performance; energy deficit was not.

40|$|The authors {{automated}} {{the selection}} of foods in a computer system that compiles and processes tailored FFQ. For {{the selection of}} food items, several methods are available. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare food lists made by MOM 2, which identifies food items with highest between-person variance in intake of the nutrients of interest without taking other items into account, with food lists made by forward regression. The name MOM 2 refers to the variance, which is the second moment of the nutrient intake distribution. Food items were selected for the nutrients of interest from 2 d of recorded intake in 3524 adults aged 25 – 65 years. Food lists by 80 % MOM 2 were compared to those by 80 % explained variance for regression on differences between the number and type of food items, and were evaluated on (1) the percentage of explained variance and (2) percentage contribution to population intake computed for the selected items on the food list. MOM 2 selected the same food items for Ca, a few more for fat and vitamin C, and a few less for carbohydrates and dietary fibre than forward regression. Food lists by MOM 2 based on 80 % of variance in <b>intake</b> <b>covered</b> 75 – 87 % of explained variance for different nutrients by regression and contributed 53 – 75 % to total population intake. Concluding, for developing food lists of FFQ, it appears sufficient to select food items based on the contribution to variance in nutrient intake without taking covariance into accoun...|$|R
40|$|Consumer risk {{assessment}} {{relating to the}} maximum limits of pesticide residues is a crutial step in {{the approval of the}} plant protection products for an agricultural use. Although MRL is not a health limit it fully reflects the safety intake of the food containing residues of the pesticide for which the MRL has been set. MRL should be derived from the supervised residue field studies carried our according to the international rules and its final value is calculated by the statistical models. MRL value is required to be assessed for a dietary exposure risk. Residues dietary <b>intake</b> <b>covered</b> by the MRL {{is the result of the}} {{risk assessment}} which is then compared to the toxicological reference values of ADI (Acceptable Daily Intake) and ARfD (Acute Reference Dose). Until recently, attention has focused on estimating chronic intake because long term effects have been of more concern. It has been recognized meantime that many of the commonly used pesticides can have adverse effects when a single dose with a high residue content is ingested. The probability of a high residue content can be increased since a variability of residues appears, mainly in units of fruit and vegetables. Such variability expressed as a variability factor at present, is one of the inputs into the International Estimated Daily Intake (IESTI) equation. The variability appears to be generally independent of the type of pesticide, however it still depends on many other factors. The pesticide deposition on the individual food unit is probably the most significant factor. Variability is variable itself and is very difficult to standardize. The MRL risk assessment conclusion differences are affected by many factors so the international regulatory bodies make an effort focused on the harmonization of the MRL risk assessment methodologies by the means of creating new tool like guidance documents or calculation models...|$|R

50|$|The early {{generation}} 1JZ-GTEs {{combined the}} inherent smoothness of an inline 6-cylinder engine with the revving capacity of its short stroke and early power delivery of its small, ceramic wheeled turbochargers. The ceramic turbine wheels {{are prone to}} delamination {{in the setting of}} high impeller rpm and local temperature conditions, usually a result of higher boost. The first generation 1JZs were even more prone to turbo failure due to there being a faulty one-way valve on the head, specifically on the <b>intake</b> cam <b>cover</b> causing blow-by gases to go into the intake manifold. On the exhaust side, a decent amount of oil vapor flows into the turbos causing premature wear on the seals. The later second generation engines had this problem fixed and in Japan there was actually a recall in order to repair the first generation engines, though that does not apply to 1JZs imported to other countries. The fix is simple, and involves replacement of the PCV valve (2JZ); all parts are available through Toyota.|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIObjective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of combined calcium and iron versus single iron supplementation on iron status in Bolivian schoolchildren. Methods: Children ages 6 to 10 y old (N = 195), were randomly assigned to receive either 700 mg Ca (as calcium carbonate) plus 30 mg Fe (as ferrous sulfate) (Ca + Fe group) or 30 mg Fe (as ferrous sulfate) (Fe group). The doses were administered daily, from Monday to Friday, between meals at school over 3 mo. Iron status was assessed at baseline and after intervention. Additionally, overall nutritional status was assessed by anthropometry and an estimation of dietary intake. Results: At baseline, the prevalence of anemia in the Ca + Fe group and the Fe group were 15 % and 21. 5 %, respectively. After 3 mo follow-up, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia dropped significantly (P < 0. 001) to 3 % in both groups (X 2 = NS). Iron dietary intake was within recommended levels, but calcium <b>intake</b> only <b>covered</b> 39 % of the Recommended Daily Intake.

50|$|Raw vegans {{who follow}} a low-fat {{approach}} to raw veganism seek {{a very specific}} nutritional balance of carbohydrates/protein/fat ratio from their diet, trying to ensure they have a sufficient intake of calories, and placing greater importance on those ratios than on their foods being raw. Most low-fat raw vegans (LFRVs) follow an 80/10/10 ratio, and some a more lax 70/10/20 or more strict 90/5/5, trying to achieve between 2000 and 3000 calories per day, averaged per week, and according to exercise levels (some athletes consume an average of 6000 calories per day). Obtaining such a high amount of calories from carbohydrates from raw foods requires consuming large quantities of sweet and ripe fruit, such as bananas and dates, generally blended or juiced. Considering that a typical banana provides 100 calories, a LFRV following a typical 3000-calorie regime requiring 80% of the calories coming from carbohydrates must consume 2400 calories of banana daily, i.e. 24 bananas, or 48 dates, or 5.3 litres of orange juice, which provides almost all the required intake of protein and fat to satisfy the ratio. Most LFRV also consume a large low-fat salad daily to ensure the required protein, mineral and vitamin daily <b>intake</b> is <b>covered.</b> The low-fat raw vegan lifestyle has been tried by several athletes.|$|R
40|$|This is Part 4 / 5 of {{a series}} {{concerned}} with seasonality in the coastal lowlands of Kenya. Household surveys were carried out in six locations in Kwale and Kilifi Districts in 1985 - 1987. The present report deals with food consumption and the nutritional condition of the study population. Results show that the average energy intake in the sampled households is substantially lower than the reference requirements. However, energy intake differs according to research area, income class and season. On average, only {{about one-third of the}} energy <b>intake</b> is <b>covered</b> by the households' own food production. The general seasonality pattern of height and weight growth of the children differs little between the research areas. However, the amplitudes of the seasonal fluctuations differ between the areas. Household income level appears to be an important variable underlying differences in the seasonality of height growth and weight growth. The relationship between household income level and seasonality in the mothers' weight is more complex. In the present study, 'seasonal stress' is assessed in terms of a deterioration of the nutritional condition of the people. To a certain extent, most households are able to prevent this type of seasonal stress by buying food with money derived from a more or less regular type of off-farm employment {{and to a lesser extent}} also from farm sales...|$|R
40|$|The early {{lactation}} {{period of}} dairy cows, which produce high quantities of milk, is normally {{characterized by an}} insufficient energy <b>intake</b> to <b>cover</b> milk production and maintenance requirements. Mobilization of body reserves occurs to compensate this negative energy balance (NEB), and probably as a consequence there is a higher susceptibility to diseases and metabolic disorders. There are several diagnostic methods to detect NEB, usually involving ketosis related parameters. Due to the easy availability of milk this is a preferred matrix, but simple and robust predictors of NEB level are missing. To better understand the physiological mechanism of NEB, milk of cows subjected to different dry period lengths, in different energy balance status and lactation stage, were analyzed by untargeted metabolomics and proteomics techniques. Milk of cows in severe NEB showed higher concentrations of acute phase response proteins, unsaturated fatty acids, and galactose- 1 -phosphate. Improved energy balance (EB) resulted in higher concentration of cholesterol, cholesterol synthesis related proteins, and stomatin. The presence of stomatin and galactose- 1 -phosphate in milk was strongly dependent on the EB of the cows. These novel and interesting findings warrant more in-depth research to assess their applicability as robust indicators of NEB in milk and to clarify the role of stomatin and galactose- 1 -phophate in milk of dairy cows in NEB...|$|R
