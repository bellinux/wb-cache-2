40|$|Following the {{mechanical}} verification logic of spacecraft structures, a comprehensive programme of system identification and qualification tests {{was performed on}} the PPF/ENVISAT- 1 Flight Model, the largest European satellite up to now. In the course of this test programme it was required to obtain a modal identification of the satellite from the Sine Vibration Test data, because a dedicated Modal Survey test as for the Structural Model was not foreseen for the Flight Model. The Sine Vibration Test was performed on HYDRA <b>hydraulic</b> multi-axis <b>shaker</b> at ESTEC. The Sine Vibration Test data were to be utilized to identify the dynamic properties used to derive the flight loads and to validate the structural dynamic mathematical model of the spacecraft in terms of eigenfrequencies, mode shapes, and damping values. It was anticipated, that this baseline approach of modal identification could possibly be complicated by the cross-couping of the excitation axes of the HYDRA facility. Therefore an alternative approach of modal identification was requested. From the experiences with the Structural Model, DLR proposed to perform a simplified Modal Survey Test to complementary identify a number of modes. This "Mini Modal Survey Test" was to be performed in a simplified manner due to test and schedule constraints. The present paper describes the test performance and the modal identification of the Flight Model of PPF/ENVISAT- 1 following both approaches.

40|$|A {{prototype}} {{reinforced concrete}} moment frame representative of low-rise office {{buildings in the}} Central and Eastern United States from the 1950 s- 1970 s was designed and selected for evaluation under seismic loads. A plane frame specimen from the prototype was incorporated into {{the design of a}} test-bed of four full-scale, side-by-side nominally identical structures that could be evaluated independently. The testing of the first frame serves as the topic of this dissertation. The specimen was two bays x two stories x 9 -ft. wide. A new method for testing full-scale structures under seismic loads was proposed that used a <b>hydraulic</b> linear inertial <b>shaker</b> (LIS) to impart seismic loads. The response of the structure was monitored using 155 strain gages, 38 linear variable differential transformers, six string potentiometers, and 42 accelerometers. The response of the frame to a series of 25 load histories using the nees@UCLA LIS was marked by gradual structural softening and minimal yielding of the steel reinforcing throughout the structure. At a first interstory drift of 1. 5 % some yielding of the reinforcing bars was measured. Between 1. 5 % and 2 % first interstory drift, a global sway mechanism formed when the failure of a splice {{at the base of the}} first story west column led to a cascading set of failures within other first-story column splices.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 An {{association}} between occupational whole body vibration (WBV) exposure {{and the development}} of lower back pain (LBP) has been established through numerous epidemiological studies. However, the etiological and biomechanical mechanisms of how WBV contributes to LBP and injury are not well understood. Using field-measured occupational WBV exposures in a controlled laboratory setting, this study attempted to expose the human lumbar spine to occupational WBV exposures to better understand the mechanisms of WBV-related low back injury. The occupational exposures selected for this study were those encountered by bus drivers, who are known to have a high prevalence of LBP. Continuous and impulsive WBV accelerations collected at the floor of a bus traversing a standardized route in the Seattle metro area were played into a six-degree of freedom <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker</b> platform. Twelve professional drivers sat on an air suspension seat mounted to a six-degree of freedom <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker</b> platform. The drivers' response to the continuous and impulsive exposures at the seat and sternum were recorded. The difference between seat- and sternum-measured accelerations were used to calculate the displacement of the spine during the vibrations encountered during continuous and impulsive exposures. Based on these two exposure patterns for the bus drivers, six human lumbar functional spine units (FSUs) were placed in a servohydraulic testing system and continuously exposed to one of the two vibration signatures. A unique staining technique was used to visually differentiate preexisting intervertebral disc damage and damage brought on by cycling the FSU. No discernible damage was found for discs exposed to the continuous WBV while exposing FSUs to the impulsive WBV resulted in endplate fractures and damage to the annulus fibrosis of the intervertebral disc. These findings indicate that, for equal drive times, a more impulsive and intermittent loading signature is more likely to cause injury to components of the low back than a relatively less impulsive and more continuous signature...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{due to the}} {{widespread}} access to information, modern consumers acquire products after comparing different alternatives. As a result, {{there is a need}} to design and manufacture products with improved performance and increased functionality at reduced price. Examples of mechatronic system cover a broad range such as home appliances, consumer goods, modern automotive and aerospace vehicles, manufacturing machines, industrial robots, machine tools and many others. A typical mechatronic system comprises several sub-systems. Integrating these sub-systems and achieving system level functionality and performance specifications is very challenging due to limited understanding of complex interdependencies and interactions between these different sub-systems. Traditional or conventional system engineering methods used in the modern industry segment do not allow to push the existing limits. To this end, model centric approaches are gaining popularity in the mechatronic industry in order to overcome the existing shortcomings and accelerate the design and development process. This doctoral research focuses on combining modeling and model-based control techniques to enhance model based system engineering for modern complex mechatronics systems. In order to demonstrate the potential of model based approaches, three different contributions relevant to mechatronic industry are made. The first contribution proposes to use multi-fidelity models for the virtual prototyping of complex mechatronic system. To this end, a complex model for an industrial 3 -axes industrial machine is made to demonstrate the potential of virtual prototyping. The model comprises a 3 D flexible multibody model, a 1 D drive line model and a controller. The virtual design and analysis help to reduce the number of design and prototyping iterations, and consequently avoids delays, cost over runs, brand damages and even customer dissatisfaction. The second contribution is a system-level design approach to push the performance of a mechatronic system to its limits. Conventionally, in order to design and develop a complete mechatronic system, engineers adopt a sequential approach. Often, a control engineer cannot meet the desired specifications because of the poorly designed plant. To this end, an efficient concurrent design of optimal plant and feedback controller is proposed. The proposed technique falls under the category of nested optimization approach and can deal with the shortcomings of the existing techniques available in the literature. The developed co-design approach is validated for an industrial gantry machine and an electric motor. In industry, engineers continuously try to find discrepancies in the design before rolling out a new product to the market. Therefore, service load simulation and component testing such as qualification tests, durability tests, and endurance tests are an integral part of the overall design and development process. A substantial amount of these tests is usually performed on multi-axial hydraulic test rigs in the laboratory. The third contribution is an alternative strategy for the service load simulation process that can deal with the shortcomings of the existing techniques available in the literature. This new strategy has been validated both numerically using linear and non-linear models of a suspension test rig and experimentally using an industrial multi-axial <b>hydraulic</b> CUBE <b>Shaker.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

Dynamic qualification means experimental simulation of the structural dynamic environment in order to check the dynamic behaviour of spacecraft. The paper reviews the standard (single axis testing) and advanced test methods (multi axis testing). Two principly different multi-axis test methods are described. First, the possibilities of transient load simulation by means of multi-axis <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker</b> facilities are discussed. Particularly the assessment of the reproduction quality of the base acceleration is emphasized. A suitable transient comparison measure is proposed. Second, a shaker test method called Modal Force Combination technique is described which replaces the base acceleration by having a set of forces acting directly in a selected number of structural points. The forces simulate the d'Alembert's inertia forces, which arise due to the transient multi-axial base acceleration. Test results are presented. Finally, the different test methods of structural dynamic qualification are compared, advantages as well as inadequacies of each procedure are pointed out. The topics of further investigation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop advanced system identification techniques {{that can be used to}} accurately measure the frequency response functions of a wind-turbine structure immersed in wind noise. To allow for accurate identification, the authors have developed a special test signal called the Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS). The Matlab program that generates this signal allows the user to interactively tailor its parameters for the frequency range of interest based on the response of the wind turbine under test. By controlling NREL`s Mobile <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>Shaker</b> System, which is attached to the wind turbine structure, the PRBS signal produces the wide-band excitation necessary to perform system identification in the presence of wind noise. The techniques presented here will enable researchers to obtain modal parameters from an operating wind turbine, including frequencies, damping coefficients, and mode shapes. More importantly, the algorithms they have developed and tested (so far using input-output data from a simulated structure) permit state-space representation of the system under test, particularly the modal state space representation. This is the only system description that reveals the internal behavior the system, such as the interaction between the physical parameters, and which, in contrast to transfer functions, is valid for non-zero initial conditions...|$|E
40|$|Experimental work is {{reported}} here, which {{was carried out}} on a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker,</b> to verify the black-box system identification procedure developed in Part 1 of the paper. A linear parametric transfer function model of the spray boom has been identified from an experimental input-output data set based on the frequency domain maximum likelihood estimator. Since {{the accuracy of the}} model depends strongly {{on the quality of the}} data records, much attention is paid in this paper to the design of the experiment: three different reference signals and two types of transducers for both input and output have been tested. All data sets have been compared to evaluate the ability to obtain accurate frequency response functions in the frequency band of interest (0 - 5 Hz). Longitudinal and vertical boom motion could be accurately described by a linear low-order model structure. Subsequently, the models were thoroughly validated with a simulation experiment. Finally, to evaluate the effect of boom movements on the spray deposit distribution, vibrations at the boom tip are simulated with the experimental models for realistic inputs. The corresponding spray deposition is generated with a liquid simulation program. From these simulations, it is concluded that both the rolling motion and horizontal vibrations of the boom can severely disturb the spray deposition pattern.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to optimise {{the position of}} an "on-the-go" soil sensor installed on a variable rate (VR) granular fertiliser application system. Optimisation {{was carried out by}} measuring the lag time between acquiring the information on soil phosphorus (P) from the soil sensor and changing the fertiliser rate on the fertilisation system. The sensing system consisted of a soil sensor coupled with a Ziess spectrophotometer (CORONA fibre VISNIR 1. 7). The applicator was a four-row planter- applicator from AMAZONE (ED 302). The overall lag time consisted of a series of sub lag times consisting of the times required to collect soil spectra, compile data, change the fertiliser rate and the travel time of granules from the fertiliser metering devices to furrow openers. The static and dynamic tests were carried out to measure these lag times. For the dynamic test, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker</b> (Four Poster Vibratory Stands) was used to simulate the working movement under field conditions. The results revealed that the important factor for positioning the soil sensor {{at the front of the}} "on-the-go" fertiliser application system is tractor speed. The results showed that the soil sensor should be installed at the front of the tractor and an extra time delay should be artificially included. (c) 2008 lAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We present an alternative method, capturing the 3 D effects in the soil-pile interaction, in which the soil is characterized with in-situ seismic measurements. As {{the design of the}} foundations of offshore wind turbines often involves many expensive load simulations (load cases), the method also includes finding an effective 1 D or Winkler stiffness yielding a similar pile response as in the 3 D model. The method is exemplified for a real 5 m-diameter monopile embedded in stiff dense sand, in a near-shore wind farm in The Netherlands. The dynamic properties of this pile have been tested (prior to installation of the super-structure) with a unique measurement setup using a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker,</b> exciting between 1 and 9 Hz. The response of this stand-alone pile is highly sensitive to the soil and allowed us to verify the effective 1 D stiffness with much higher certainty as opposed to the usual situation including dynamic disturbances and uncertainties related to the interaction with the super-structure.

40|$|In {{bicycles}} and motorcycles {{the mass of}} the rider is a relevant share of the total mass and the passive response of the rider’s body to vibrations influences the dynamics and stability of the whole system. Therefore advanced models of twowheeled vehicles have to include a passive biomechanical model of the rider. This paper focuses on the development of biomechanical models able to simulate the response of the rider to yaw and steer oscillations and on the identification of the rider’s body mechanical properties. Rider models composed by some rigid bodies with lumped stiffness and damping elements in the articulations are developed. The inertial properties of the rider’s model are calculated from anthropometric data. The stiffness and damping properties are obtained from laboratory tests in which the rider rides a motorcycle mock-up driven by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker</b> generating yaw oscillations.

For more than 15 years, a multi-axis vibration test facility has been under service, originally designed for earthquake simulation but being upgraded to the demands of space testing. First tests with the DFS/STM showed good reproduction accuracy and demonstrated the feasibility of transient vibration testing of space objects on a multi-axis <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker.</b> An approach to structural qualification is possible by using this test philosophy. It will be outlined and its obvious advantages over the state-of-the-art single-axis test will be demonstrated by example results. The new test technique has some special requirements to the test facility exceeding those of earthquake testing. Most important is the high reproduction accuracy demanded for a sophisticated control system. The state-of-the-art approach of analog closed-loop control circuits for each actuator combined with a static decoupling network and an off-line iterative waveform control is not able to meet all the demands. Therefore, the future over-all control system is implemented as hierarchical full digital closed-loop system on a highly parallel transputer network. The innermost layer is the digital actuator controller, the second one is the MDOF-control of the table movement.

40|$|The tire dynamic {{transfer}} stiffness {{describes how}} a displacement enforced at the tire contact patch {{results in a}} force at the spindle-wheel interface. The dynamic transfer stiffness is expressed {{as a function of}} frequency and provides insight in the generation of vehicle interior structure-borne tire/road noise. The road surface texture excites the tire at the contact patch, resulting in structural waves travelling around the circumference of the tire. The tire sidewalls transfer these vibrations to the rim. The vibrational energy is then transmitted through the spindle-wheel interface toward the suspension and vehicle body. The resulting body panel and window vibrations cause noise radiation in the passenger compartment. It is known that the tire dynamic properties are dependent on the vibration amplitude. Therefore, the excitation levels during tire dynamic characterization tests should be similar as the excitation levels during operation of the tire. This is not possible with the classic excitation devices such as hammer and electrodynamic shakers. This paper presents an experimental method to obtain the dynamic transfer stiffness of a non-rolling tire which is excited at operational excitation levels. Therefore, a high-frequency 6 -DOF <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker</b> table (CUBE R ○) is used to excite the tire.

40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{split into two}} parts: {{in the first part}} the {{different}} dynamic damage indicators are defined and applied to beam and slab structures under laboratory conditions, whereas the present second part deals with experiments carried out on two real post-tensioned bridges. The damage indicators defined in part one are based on swept sine excitation and esveal the drop of the eigenfrequencies, the changes in damping, the varying dependency range of the first eigenfrequency on excitation force amplitude and the occurrence of higher harmonics, which changed the Total Harmonic Distorsion (THD) and a special transfer-function called TF or FRFsmall. In the first part it was proved that the amount of nonlinearities varies with damage and that harmonic excitation is favorable for good test conditions. In the laboratory this can easily be done using an electric or <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker,</b> but on real bridges this kind of excitation becomes more complicated due to the higher forces and the necessity to provide counter bearing for any shaker system. That is why two machines were designed and used to excite big structures harmonically, e. g. real bridges in this part. The different indicators are applied to assess the state of two post-tensioned bridges, which had been in good order and condition before artificial damage in multiple steps was caused. It turns out that the decrease in the eigenfrequencies is the most important damage indicator, provided temperature and mass dependant effects can be eliminated. All other indicators may be used as supplements to give correct tendencies, but no strict limits...|$|E

By controlling the synthesized electrical damper, the system is capable of providing variable damping forces, ranging from under-damped to over-damped cases, while regenerating mechanical vibration energy into electric charge stored in a battery. To demonstate the concept, the developed converter {{is attached to a}} small-scale one-degree-of-freedom suspension prototype which emulates a vehicle suspension mechanism. The energy regeneration mechanism consists of a mass-spring system and a ball-screw motion converter mechanism coupled to a DC machine, excited by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker.</b> The motion converter stage converts vibrational motion into a bi-directional rotatory motion, resulting in generation of back-emf in the rotary machine. We also introduce an optimized start/stop algorithm for the harvesting of energy using the proposed power converter. The algorithm allows for improvements in power conversion efficiency enhancement (≈ 14 % under class C road profile) through turning the circuit on/off during its operation. The idea is to ensure that the converter only operates in the positive conversion efficiency region; meaning that when there is enough energy the converter starts the energy harvesting process. Furthermore, an estimation of range enhancement for a full-scale electric vehicle (EV) is furnished using regenerative suspension. It is estimated that for a full size EV (e. g., Tesla model S), a range extension of 10 - 30 % is highly realistic, depending on the road conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} of dimensions and {{recent advances in}} lightweight design of space systems {{have led to the}} requirement of new structural dynamic qualification techniques. Dynamic qualification means experimental simulation of the structural dynamic environment in order to check the dynamic behaviour of spacecraft. Presently, structural dynamic qualification of space systems is accomplished by means of single-axis electrodynamic shaker systems. For the last ten years multi-axis <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker</b> systems have also been under investigation to supplement and possibly replace the current single-axis testing philosophy. Both methods apply base acceleration at the interface between the satellite and launcher. Thus, they require high forces in order to accelerate the total mass of the test structure. An alternative test philosophy was proposed and investigated in a study funded by ESA. The new concept called the Modal Force Combination (MFC) technique replaces the base acceleration by having a set of forces acting directly in a selected number of structural points. The forces compensate for the d'Alembert's inertia forces, which arise due to the transient multi-axial base acceleration. The transient forcing functions are calculated by means of modal deformations and related modal force distributions {{in order to get the}} same structural responses of the structure as would occur by base acceleration. The direct substitution of distributed forces by means of a set of single forces yielding the same responses is generally impossible. This would require too many exciters. However, the MFC method offers two possibilities to perform a simulation. The first version is based on the demand for the equality of the input energy expressed bymeans of the modes of vibration. The second version starts with the demand for the equality of the structural responses in the points o...|$|E
40|$|A fixed {{geometry}} hybrid {{thrust bearing}} is investigated {{with three different}} supply orifice diameters. The test rig uses a face-to-face thrust bearing design, with the test bearing acting as the rotor loading mechanism. A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker</b> applies the static axial load, which is reacted by a second thrust bearing. The rotor is supported radially by two water-lubricated fluid film journal bearings and {{is attached to a}} 30, 600 rpm motor via a high speed coupling with very low axial stiffness. Thrust bearings with three different orifice diameters (1. 63, 1. 80, and 1. 93 mm) are tested for a range of supply pressures, fluid film thicknesses, and rotational speeds. The water-lubricated test bearings have eight pockets, with feed orifices located centrally in each pocket. Experimental results are comparted to predictions found using bulk flow model HYDROTHRUST. Analysis of the data reveals generally good agreements between predictions and measurements. Thrust-bearing inlet supply and inner radius flow rates all decreased with decreasing orifice diameters and bearing axial clearances. In most cases, the bearings with larger orifice diameters exhibit higher recess pressure ratios, operating clearances, and flow rates. The largest orifice diameter configuration does not display higher recess pressure ratios or operating clearances at high speeds for some supply pressures, but it does continue to require additional lubricant flow rate compared to the smaller orifice bearings. In these cases, the results are not reflected in predictions, which otherwise correlate very well with experimental measurements. Estimations of static loading axial stiffness are obtained using experimental results. An optimum hybrid thrust bearing orifice diameter will depend on the conditions of individual applications. Larger orifices generally provide larger operating clearances and higher stiffnesses, but also require higher flow rates. For most applications, a compromise of bearing performance parameters will be desired. The test results and comparisons presented will aid in sizing orifice diameters for future hybrid thrust bearing designs...|$|E
40|$|LectureLecture 1 : Pre-Salt {{development}} projects {{continue to expand}} offshore Brazil into ever deeper waters year after year. Consequently, the required Discharge Pressures for Re-Injection Compressors aboard FPSO?s are likely to exceed current 550 bar levels, and requirements for design of higher pressure compressors becomes more severe. This paper presents development of super high pressure compressor {{and the results of}} verification tests. Super high pressure compressor can be used as re-injection compressor or injection compressor such as in the CCS plant and FPSO. Rotor stability is the most considerable requirement for super high pressure operation because of the high density flow destabilizing force in the compressor. From {{the point of view of}} rotor dynamics, the short bearing span and high shaft diameter are desirable for the stability of the rotor. On the other hand, from the point of view of aerodynamics performance, that rotor arrangement may decrease the performance. Some parametric study was conducted to optimize the boss ratio of compressor stage to get both high rotor dynamic stability and high aerodynamic performance. Rotating stall can be the cause of sub-synchronous vibrations in super high pressure operating condition and it induces narrow operation range. To prevent such situation, vaned diffuser was applied for developed compressor stage and it can also help to reduce the diffuser radius space. Seal leakage flow have large effects on the rotor stability and aerodynamic performance. For this item, the hybrid construction of hole pattern seal and step labyrinth seal was proposed. Hole pattern seal is well known as damping seal for high pressure compressor. CFD dynamic analysis and dynamic characteristics test for this hybrid hole pattern seal are introduced under the condition of high density by using <b>hydraulic</b> <b>shaker</b> device. The extensive verification test of developed super high pressure compressor were conducted with impeller of optimized boss ratio, vaned diffuser and hybrid honeycomb seal, and has demonstrated the robustness for all field operating condition including molecular weight variation with high aerodynamic performance and small vibration...|$|E
