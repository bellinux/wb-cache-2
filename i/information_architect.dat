50|$|Wireframes may be {{utilized}} by different disciplines. Developers use wireframes {{to get a}} more tangible grasp of the site’s functionality, while designers use them to push the user interface (UI) process.

Business Analysts use wireframes to visually support the business rules and interaction requirements for a screen. Business stakeholders review wireframes to ensure that requirements and objectives are met through the design. Professionals who create wireframes include business analysts, <b>information</b> <b>architects,</b> interaction designers, user experience designers, graphic designers, programmers, and product managers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To {{be faced}} with a {{document}} collection {{and not to be}} able to find the information you know exists somewhere within it is a problem as old as the existence of document collections. Information architecture is the discipline dealing with the modern version of this problem: how to organize web sites so that users can actually find what they are looking for. <b>Information</b> <b>architects</b> have so far applied known and welltried tools from library science to solve this problem, and now topic maps are sailing up as another potential tool for <b>information</b> <b>architects.</b> This raises the question of how topic maps compare with the traditional solutions, and that is the question this paper attempts to address. The paper argues that topic maps go beyond the traditional solutions in the sense that they provide a framework within which they can be represented as they are, but also extended in ways which significantly improve information retrieval...|$|R
