This paper considers the law on information disclosure for joint consultation and collective bargaining in three countries, Germany, France, and the UK, chosen for their <b>distinctive</b> <b>legal</b> and institutional <b>arrangements,</b> within a common European Union context. It is argued that there is coherence between the law and institutions in Germany; in France, despite extensive legal support for information provision, the law and institutions complement one another less; in the UK, there are contradictory approaches and new dilemmas confronting the traditional system. Although European Directives harmonise statutory minima, there are few signs of common disclosure practice emerging across the three countries...|$|R

40|$|Resumé: In my {{rigorous}} work I {{dealt with}} the <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the special working conditions of juveniles and minors. These conditions are being legally arranged since over two centuries. One of the characteristical signs {{in the development of}} this <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement</b> is enlarging the legal protection of working minors as well as of juveniles resulting namely in shortening the working hours for minors, determinations of the minimal age for taking a job, determinations of the obligatory school attendance duration as well as the inhibition of certain works and workplace which are dangerous for juveniles. The development of the <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the above mentioned working conditions is strongly affected by legal documents from the field of the european as well as international law arranging the fundamental human, social and economical rights. These international documents complete and enlarge the Czech <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the special working conditions of the juveniles. The Labour code no. 262 / 2006 Sb. with the relating legal rules provide a special legal protection since these juveniles are not yet physically and mentally adult enough and thus their sound and safe development has to be protected. These special working conditions differ from general conditions for other employees and manifest before all [...] .

40|$|The <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements</b> for the {{management}} of water resources are currently a complex matrix of rules of various kinds. These rules perform a diverse range of functions. Some are part of what may be described as the macro-legal system for the governance of water resources. This includes paralegal rules in the form of statements of value, objective, outcome or principles. Others are part of the micro-legal system for the governance of water resources. This includes traditional legal rules in the form of statements of standards in relation to individual conduct, behaviour or decision making. These <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements</b> may be international, regional, national or local. Accordingly some apply to nation states within the international community. Others apply to the regulatory agencies making decisions about water resources within nation states. Ultimately most of these <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements</b> apply to those who use and develop water resources for particular purposes and in particular locations. In accordance with this framework, rules explain how water resources should be used in particular circumstances and how decisions should be made to ensure the effective planning and regulation of water resources...|$|R

The thesis deals with the topic of commencement of basic labour relations and its comparison with the German <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement.</b> Therefore it is divided into three parts. The first part closely focuses on the commencement of basic labour relations according to the Czech law in force. The second part describes the commencement of labour relations according to the law in force of the Federal Republic of Germany. The third part compares and contrasts both <b>legal</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The first part is the most extensive. It describes the historical development of labour law in general, its sources as well as its incorporation into the legal system of the Czech Republic. Furthermore, it defines labour relations, basic labour relations and commencement of labour relations. Finally, the author endeavours to adumbrate the future development of private law with respect to the imminent coming into force of the new civil code. The second part, which describes the German <b>legal</b> <b>arrangement,</b> conceptually follows the previous part. The author adheres to the terminology of German labour law and to the description of commencement of labour relations according to German textbooks. The third part is the shortest and it compares and contrasts the similarities [...] ...|$|R
