25|$|Nevertheless, MOSFETs {{are widely}} used in many types of analog {{circuits}} because of their own advantages (zero <b>gate</b> <b>current,</b> high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base). The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the MOSFETs used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors {{the size of the}} device does not significantly affect its performance. MOSFETs' ideal characteristics regarding <b>gate</b> <b>current</b> (zero) and drain-source offset voltage (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make switched capacitor analog circuits practical. In their linear region, MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from thermal runaway as BJTs do. Also, MOSFETs can be configured to perform as capacitors and gyrator circuits which allow op-amps made from them to appear as inductors, thereby allowing all of the normal analog devices on a chip (except for diodes, which can be made smaller than a MOSFET anyway) to be built entirely out of MOSFETs. This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques. MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback.|$|E

We also studied the effects of brief interpulse intervals in axons pretreated with chloramine-T for removal of fast inactivation. We find marked effects of <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> kinetics induced by both prepulse inactivation and brief interpulse intervals. The apparent changes in <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> relaxation rates cannot be explained simply by changes in gating charge magnitude (charge immobilization) combined with "Cole-Moore-type" time shifts.

40|$|Nonlinear {{capacitative}} current (charge movement) {{was compared}} to the Ca current (ICa) in single guinea pig ventricular myocytes. It was concluded that the charge movement seen with depolarizing test steps from - 50 mV is dominated by L-type Ca channel <b>gating</b> <b>current,</b> because of the following observations. (a) Ca channel inactivation and the immobilization of the <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> had similar voltage and time dependencies. The degree of channel inactivation was directly proportional {{to the amount of}} charge immobilization, unlike what has been reported for Na channels. (b) The degree of Ca channel activation was closely correlated with the amount of charge moved at all test potentials between - 40 and + 60 mV. (c) D 600 was found to reduce the <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> in a voltage- and use-dependent manner. D 600 was also found to induce "extra" charge movement at negative potentials. (d) Nitrendipine reduced the <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> in a voltage-dependent manner (KD = 200 nM at - 40 mV). However, nitrendipine did not increase charge movement at negative test potentials. Although contamination of the Ca channel <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> from other sources cannot be fully excluded, it was not evident in the data and would appear to be small. However, it was noted that the amount of Ca channel gating charge was quite large compared with the magnitude of the Ca <b>current.</b> Indeed, the <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> was found to be a significant contaminant (19 +/- 7 %) of the Ca tail currents in these cells. In addition, it was found that Ca channel rundown did not diminish the <b>gating</b> <b>current.</b> These results suggest that Ca channels can be "inactivated" by means that do not affect the voltage sensor...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The peptide 0 ~-agatoxin-IIIA (co-Aga-IIIA) blocks {{ionic current}} through L-type Ca {{channels}} in guinea pig atrial cells without affecting the associated <b>gating</b> <b>currents,</b> c 0 -Aga-IIIA permits {{the study of}} L-type Ca channel ionic and <b>gating</b> <b>currents</b> under nearly identical ionic conditions. Under conditions that isolate L-type Ca channel currents, 0 ~-Aga-IIIA blocks all ionic current during a test pulse and after repolarization. This block reveals intramembrane charge movements of equal magnitude and opposite sign {{at the beginning of}} the pulse (Qon) and after repolarization (Qo~). Qon and Qo ~ are suppressed by 1 ~M felodipine, saturate with increasing test potential, and are insensitive to Cd. The decay of the transient current associated with Qon is composed of fast and slow exponential components. The slow component has a time constant similar to that for activation of L-type Ca channel ionic current, over a broad voltage range. The current associated with Qog decays monoexponentially and more slowly than ionic current. Similar charge movements are found in guinea pig tracheal myocytes, which lack Na channels and T-type Ca channels. The kinetic and pharmacological properties of Qon and Qoer indicate that they reflect <b>gating</b> <b>currents</b> associated with L-type Ca channels. o-Aga-IIIA has no effect on <b>gating</b> <b>currents</b> when ionic current is eliminated by stepping to the reversal potential for Ca or by Cd block. <b>Gating</b> <b>currents</b> constitute a significant component of total current when physiological concentrations of Ca are present and they obscure the activation and deactivation of L-type Ca channels. By using o-Aga-IIIA, we resolve the entire time course of L-type Ca channel ionic and <b>gating</b> <b>currents.</b> We also show that L- and T-type Ca channel ionic currents can be accurately quantified by tail <b>current</b> analysis once <b>gating</b> <b>currents</b> are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|A {{kinetic model}} of sodium {{activation}} gating is presented. The kinetics {{are based on}} harmonic analysis of <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> data obtained during large-amplitude sinusoidal voltage clamp in dynamic steady state. The technique classifies gating kinetic schemes into groups based on patterns of the harmonic content in the periodic <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> records. The kinetics that simulate the experimental data contain two independently constrained processes. The model predicts (a) sizable <b>gating</b> <b>currents</b> in response to hyperpolarizing voltage steps from rest; (b) {{a substantial increase in}} the initial peak of the <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> following voltage steps from prehyperpolarized potentials; (c) a small delay in the onset of sodium ion current following voltage steps from prehyperpolarized potentials; and (d) flickering during the open state in single channel current records. Although fundamentally different in kinetic structure from the Hodgkin-Huxley model, the present model reproduces the phenomenological development of Na conductance during the initiation and development of action potentials. The implications for possible gating mechanisms are discussed. A model gate is presented...|$|R

40|$|In voltage-dependent ether-Ã -go-go (eag) K+ channels, {{the process}} of {{activation}} is modulated by Mg 2 + and other divalent cations, which bind to a site in the voltage sensor and slow channel opening. Previous analysis of eag ionic and <b>gating</b> <b>currents</b> indicated that Mg 2 + has a much larger effect on ionic than <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> kinetics. From this, we hypothesized that ion binding modulates voltage sensor conformational changes that are poorly represented in <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> recordings. We have now tested this proposal by using a combined electrophysiological and optical approach. We find that a fluorescent probe attached near S 4 in the voltage sensor reports on two phases of the activation process. One component of the optical signal corresponds to the main charge-moving conformational changes of the voltage sensor. This is the phase of activation that is well represented in <b>gating</b> <b>current</b> recordings. Another component of the optical signal reflects voltage sensor conformational changes that occur at more hyperpolarized potentials.

50|$|A MOSFET/IGBT is a voltage-controlled device which, in theory, {{will not}} have any <b>gate</b> <b>current.</b> This makes it {{possible}} to utilize the charge inside the capacitor for control purposes.

This is because the pulsing action allows for the capacitor to discharge (at least partially if not completely). Most control schemes that use a bootstrap capacitor force the high side driver (N-MOSFET) off for a minimum time to allow for the capacitor to refill.
