A lot of these informal connections took place at SHADE meetings.(Shared Awareness and Deconfliction) These meetings allowed for shared tactics among a large of international entities, including China, Indian, Japan, Russia, India and South Korea but is definitely not limited to them. With NATO promoting co-operation amongst these foreign entities, Operation Ocean Shield could effectively protect the area. They also developed this innovative <b>electronic</b> <b>network</b> called Mercury which shared anti-piracy tactics with other task forces and operations. Since this was an informal system, it wasn’t weighed down with bureaucracy and could be spread amongst other coalitions and governmental organizations and could effectively help anyone that needed precise information in the area.|$|E

In line with Lave & Wenger's original work (1991), Brown & Duguid propose that communities of practice are a localized and specialized subset of networks of practice, typically consisting of strong ties linking individuals engaged in a shared practice who typically interact in face-to-face situations. At {{the opposite end of}} the spectrum are <b>electronic</b> <b>networks</b> of practice, which are often referred to as virtual or electronic communities and consisting of weak ties. In <b>electronic</b> <b>networks</b> of practice, individuals may never get to know one another or meet face-to-face, and they generally coordinate through means such as blogs, electronic mailing lists, or bulletin boards.|$|R

The elections also saw [...] "the world's first automated voting system, which featured a single integrated <b>electronic</b> <b>network</b> that was supposed to transmit the results from the polling stations to central headquarters within minutes." [...] Whilst Venezuela had traditionally provided election observers to other Latin American countries, the uncertainty of the new system and the possibility of handover to a non-traditional party raised the stakes in terms of demonstrating that the elections would be fair, and Venezuela invited international election observers for the first time. The Organization of American States, European Union, Carter Center and International Republican Institute all sent delegations.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1989 posthumous book, The Global Village, McLuhan, {{collaborating with}} Bruce R. Powers, {{provided}} a strong {{conceptual framework for}} understanding the cultural implications of the technological advances associated {{with the rise of}} a worldwide <b>electronic</b> <b>network.</b> This is a major work of McLuhan's because it contains the most extensive elaboration of his concept of Acoustic Space, and it provides a critique of standard 20th century communication models like the Shannon–Weaver model. McLuhan distinguishes between the existing worldview of Visual Space – a linear, quantitative, classically geometric model – and that of Acoustic Space – a holistic, qualitative order with a complex intricate paradoxical topology. [...] "Acoustic Space has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or center is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere." [...] The transition from Visual to Acoustic Space was not automatic {{with the advent of the}} global network, but would have to be a conscious project. The [...] "universal environment of simultaneous electronic flow" [...] inherently favors right-brain Acoustic Space, yet we are held back by habits of adhering to a fixed point of view. There are no boundaries to sound. We hear from all directions at once. Yet Acoustic and Visual Space are in fact inseparable. The resonant interval is the invisible borderline between Visual and Acoustic Space. This is like the television camera that the Apollo 8 astronauts focused on the Earth after they had orbited the moon.|$|E
2500|$|The BAE Systems Ground Combat Vehicle design had a {{steel-core}} {{hull and}} an integrated <b>electronic</b> <b>network</b> capability with embedded intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance equipment. Its turret was unmanned. [...] The {{centerpiece of the}} vehicle was its simplified drive train. [...] It was propelled by a Hybrid Electric Drive (HED), which was developed by Northrop Grumman, that produced 1,100kW of electricity. [...] Advantages to it are fewer components and lower volume and weight compared to current power plants. [...] The transmission was 40 percent smaller and the drive train had half the moving parts. [...] The hybrid drive train cost 5 percent more than a mechanical system, but had a 20 percent reduction in life-cycle cost. [...] The electric drive allows for smoother low-speed operation and less noise. [...] The vehicle burned 20 percent less fuel while running, with 4.61 gallons (17.45 liters) per hour used while stationary. [...] It had {{a top speed of}} 43mph (70km/h), could go from 0 to 20mph (32.18km/hr) in 7.8 seconds, and had a range of [...] with a 255-gallon fuel capacity. [...] Disadvantages to the BAE design included a weight of 70 tons and fuel efficiency of only 0.73 mpg. [...] It was argued that big, heavy vehicles are not practical in urban combat and that the infrastructure of urban and third-world countries should limit the vehicle's weight to 45 tons. [...] Others said that urban warfare tactics have become so lethal that only vehicles of this size can survive. BAE integrated the Artis Iron Curtain active protection system to defeat incoming rockets and missiles before they can hit the vehicle. [...] The Army conducted tests on the system in April 2013, and the it successfully passed all tests. [...] A prototype system for the vehicle to drive in low visibility conditions was also tested. [...] A Humvee with blacked-out windows drove through a smoke-filled mock town with the system safely, even though visibility was completely obscured. In August 2013, the BAE GCV's hybrid electric drive completed 2,000 miles of testing on a fully integrated “Hotbuck” mobility platform. [...] The Hotbuck is a stationary test stand that simulates real-life environments and terrain and puts actual miles on the HED system. Under BAE's own timeline, the testing was completed four months ahead of schedule. [...] Developing and testing actual hardware was not a program requirement for the Technology Development (TD) phase, but BAE Systems chose to demonstrate the fuel efficiency and performance of a hybrid system.|$|E
