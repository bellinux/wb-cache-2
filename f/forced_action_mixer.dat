50|$|AF or the <b>Action</b> <b>Force</b> {{were the}} third {{generation}} of <b>Action</b> <b>Force</b> <b>action</b> figures and comic book heroes released in the United Kingdom. Originally featuring in the Battle <b>Action</b> <b>Force</b> comics and cast as action figures by Palitoy, they were an internationally re-worked version of the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero series.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the closure}} of Palitoy in 1986 and Hasbro {{acquiring}} the various intellectual property rights to the <b>Action</b> <b>Force</b> toyline, the <b>Action</b> <b>Force</b> strip was canceled. The Battle <b>Action</b> <b>Force</b> magazine was subsequently merged with Eagle.|$|R

The Swordfish craft and the two characters Leviathan and Shark represented <b>Action</b> <b>Force's</b> debut in <b>Action</b> <b>Force,</b> written by Gerry Day. Later comic storylines also constructed Red Shadow frogmen and an enemy battlecruiser although these were never realised as action figures or toys.|$|R

40|$|The Mechanical Interaction {{between the}} Toes and the Underlay in the Standing Position and Itś Relationsthip to the Elevation of the Instep The {{research}} {{is focused on}} the enquiry into the relationship between the measure of the <b>force</b> <b>action</b> of the toes on the underlay and the elevation of the instep. The basic theme was to verify, if the higher measure of the force activity of the toes correlates with the superior instep. Within filling the project of this work, there were suggested and performed original experiments. There was made a new method for the evaluation of the instep and for measuration of the <b>force</b> <b>action</b> of the toes on the underlay during the standing position on the dynamometric plates Kistler®. There were 5 probands involved in the experiment, aged 21 - 28 years, without any expressive pathological determination of the movement system. Each proband was subjected to the investigation of the elevation of the instep, and to the experiment, which found the measure of the <b>force</b> <b>action</b> of the toes on the underlay during the standing position. The data evaluation was based on comparing of both parameters, the outcomes of every single proband were comparing and there were founded their shared characteristics. Resulting from the outcomes, there is a relationship between the measure of the <b>force</b> <b>action</b> of [...] ...|$|R

The strip proved to be so popular that a further five promotional mini-comics were included free with every IPC publication in the weeks to follow. On 8 October 1983, <b>Action</b> <b>Force</b> joined the pages of Battle full-time and the comic was retitled Battle <b>Action</b> <b>Force.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} normal {{locomotion}} {{requires an understanding}} of both the movements and the <b>force</b> <b>actions</b> involved. This is equally true in appreciating the problems of pathological gait. The gait cycle is {{described in terms of}} the significant events which occur during both the stance and swing phases. The basic principles underlying the analysis of <b>force</b> <b>actions</b> in walking are briefly described. A simple example of <b>force</b> <b>actions</b> in the elbow joint is considered and the analysis extrapolated to provide a general statement regarding loco-motion. This relates to the muscle actions required to resist turning actions at joints due to the force effects in walking and the corres-ponding forces in the joints themselves. The conventional display of information relating to joint actions is considered and compared with the actual situation. “Stick diagrams ” of motion in the sagittal plane are used to identify and discuss the actions at the joints of the leg in walking. Comparisons are made between this and pathological gait-in particular that of the above-knee amputee...|$|R

Capitalising on the popularity of the real SAS, many of the comic back-stories of the characters and storylines involved SAS Force.

In this study, the mechanical model of the structure with the eccentric sleeve behind the orbiting scroll is established, the offset level of the main and second balance weight inertia <b>force</b> <b>action</b> line and inertia <b>force</b> <b>action</b> line of the eccentric weight, {{as well as the}} effect of this deviation on the second balance and the main and second bearing loads were investigated in terms of working principle, structure and loading. The results show that the structure has great influence on scroll compressor rotor system balance in reducing orbiting radius regulation. It is suggested that the correlated parameters should be optimized in designing radial compliance mechanism structure...|$|R

40|$|The neural {{basis of}} {{decision-making}} is extremely complex {{due to the}} large number of factors that contribute to the outcome of even the most basic actions as well as the range of appropriate responses within many behavioural contexts. To better understand the neural processes underlying basic forms of decision-making, this study utilized an experiment that required a choice about whether to press a button with the right or left hand. These instances of decision-making were compared to identical button presses that were experimentally specified rather than selected by the subject. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was used to record neural activity during these – what are being termed – free and <b>forced</b> <b>actions</b> and differences in the MEG signal between these two conditions were attributed to the distinct forms of neural activity required to carry out the two types of actions. To produce instances of free and forced behaviour, cued button-pressing experiments were performed that use visual, aural, and memorized cues to instruct experimental subjects of the expected outcome of individual trials. Classification analysis of the trials revealed that cortical regions that allowed for the most accurate classification of free and <b>forced</b> <b>actions</b> primarily handle sensory input for the modality used to cue the trials: occipital cortex for visually cued trials, temporal cortex for aurally cued trials, and minor non-localized differences in MEG activity for trials initiated from memory. The differential roles of visual and auditory sensory cortices during free and <b>forced</b> <b>actions</b> provided insight into the neural processing steps that were engaged to initiate cued actions. Specifically, it suggested that detectable differences exist in the activity of sensory cortices and their target sites when subjects performed free and <b>forced</b> <b>actions</b> in response to sensory cues...|$|R
