5|$|In {{the ensuing}} {{reshuffle}} in Vienna Johann Philipp Stadion became the Austrian foreign minister, freeing Metternich {{to assume the}} post of Ambassador to the Russian Empire. He {{never made it to}} Russia, as need had arisen for a new Austrian at the French court. Metternich was approved for the post in June 1806. He enjoyed being in demand and was happy to be sent to France on a generous salary of 90,000 gulden a year. After an arduous trip he took up residence in August 1806, being briefed by Baron von Vincent and Engelbert von Floret, whom he would retain as a close adviser for two decades. He met French foreign minister Charles Talleyrand on 5 August and Napoleon himself five days later at Saint-Cloud; soon, the War of the Fourth Coalition drew both Talleyrand and Napoleon eastwards. Metternich's wife and children joined him in October, and he went into society, using <b>his</b> <b>charm</b> to win great eminence there.

25|$|Dangerously destabilized, Cobra Commander's persona {{runs the}} gamut from {{friendly}} charismatic, to terrifyingly sociopathic. <b>His</b> <b>charm</b> can twist intentions and morals, so that his rhetoric actually reads as plausible and relatable to his minions. Psychoanalysts who have studied his case files, have described him as an ingenious hustler with visions of grandeur, which makes him all the more dangerous. Most dictators are hampered by pretending to pursue a noble cause, but Cobra Commander does not have that problem. He hopes to fray the fabric of society, using terrorism, tyranny and economic slavery, to uproot the existing power structures across the globe.|$|E

500|$|Roald Dahl, a screenwriter of You Only Live Twice, said he {{was given}} a formula to work to for the film: [...] "you put in three girls... Girl number one is pro-Bond. She stays around roughly through the first reel of the picture. Then she is bumped off by the enemy, preferably in Bond's arms." [...] The next girl is anti-Bond and {{normally}} captures him, but Bond will save himself by using <b>his</b> <b>charm</b> and sexual potency: she is normally killed midway through the film. Girl number three will survive and end the film in Bond's embrace.|$|E

500|$|Hay and Nicolay divided their responsibilities: Nicolay {{tending to}} assist Lincoln {{in his office}} and in meetings, while Hay dealt with the correspondence, which was very large. Both men tried to shield Lincoln from office-seekers and others who wanted to meet with the President. Unlike the dour Nicolay, Hay, with <b>his</b> <b>charm,</b> escaped much of the hard {{feelings}} from those denied Lincoln's presence. Abolitionist Thomas Wentworth Higginson described Hay as [...] "a nice young fellow, who unfortunately looks about seventeen and is oppressed with the necessity of behaving like seventy". Hay continued to write, anonymously, for newspapers, sending in columns calculated to make Lincoln appear a sorrowful man, religious and competent, giving of his life and health to preserve the Union. Similarly, Hay served as what Taliaferro deemed a [...] "White House propagandist", in his columns explaining away losses such as that at First Manassas in July 1861.|$|E

Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film was shot in 147 different locations in only 52 days, making it [...] "the most adventurous, super-charged movie-making" [...] DiCaprio had experienced yet. Catch Me If You Can received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, becoming DiCaprio's highest-grossing film since Titanic with a total of US$351.1 million worldwide. Roger Ebert praised his performance, and noted that while [...] "DiCaprio, who in recent films [...] has played dark and troubled characters, is breezy and charming here, playing a boy who discovers what he is good at, and does it." [...] The following year, DiCaprio received his third Golden Globe nomination for his work in the film.|$|E
