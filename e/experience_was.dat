Foreign <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> measured as potential experience minus Years since migration, where Years since migration is calculated as 2005 minus {{the year the}} individual’s year of immigration (that is, the year landed immigrant status was first granted).

40|$|History of {{philosophy}} is built upon rigid discrimination between various human <b>experiences.</b> Human <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> divided mainly into two major experiences: Perceptual and intelectual. Perceptual <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> deined by empiricism as an aposteriori experience of empirical sensations.

5|$|A jazz fusion album, Songs of <b>Experience</b> <b>was</b> partly {{inspired}} by Gunther Schuller's Third Stream concept, which fused American jazz with European classical music. Axelrod supported his Baroque orchestrations {{on the album}} with rhythms and melodies from rock, R, and pop music. The album's suite is more orchestral and less rock-oriented than Song of Innocence. Its symphony is embellished with percussive sounds, British and Irish folk song elements, and stylistic innovations from contemporary arranger Gerald Wilson.|$|E

40|$|That current {{ideals of}} {{cognition}} impoverish <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> a classical observation, and complaint, {{of the early}} Frankfurt School. Adorno reacts to this phenomenon in several ways, among them his conception of metaphysical <b>experiences.</b> Metaphysical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> conventionally understood as promissory notes, as metaphors for rich experiences. This article takes {{a different view of}} metaphysical experiences. It discusses them in light of Adorno's notion that objects have priority in experience and of his further remark that metaphysical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> constituted by error. It argues that rather than promissory notes or metaphors for rich <b>experiences,</b> metaphysical <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> attempts at taking things literally...|$|R
40|$|The commonsense view of {{religious}} <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> {{that it is}} a preconceptual, immediate affective event. Work in philosophy and psychology, however, suggest that religious <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> an attributional cognitive phenomenon. Here the neural correlates of a religious <b>experience</b> <b>are</b> investigated using functional neuroimaging. During religious recitation, self-identified religious subjects activated a frontal-parietal circuit, composed of the dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsomedial frontal and medial parietal cortex. Prior studies indicate that these areas play a profound role in sustaining reflexive evaluation of thought. Thus, religious <b>experience</b> may <b>be</b> a cognitive process which, nonetheless, feels immediate...|$|R
5|$|Although rather solitary and introspective by nature, Elgar {{thrived in}} Worcester's musical circles. He {{played in the}} violins at the Worcester and Birmingham Festivals, and one great <b>experience</b> <b>was</b> to play Dvořák's Symphony No. 6 and Stabat Mater under the composer's baton. Elgar {{regularly}} played the bassoon in a wind quintet, alongside his brother Frank, an oboist (and conductor who ran his own wind band). Elgar arranged numerous pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, and others for the quintet, honing his arranging and compositional skills.|$|E
5|$|Around 1749, Priestley became {{seriously ill}} and {{believed}} he was dying. Raised as a devout Calvinist, he believed a conversion <b>experience</b> <b>was</b> necessary for salvation, but doubted he had had one. This emotional distress eventually led him to question his theological upbringing, causing him to reject election and to accept universal salvation. As a result, the elders of his home church, the Independent Upper Chapel of Heckmondwike, refused him admission as a full member.|$|E
5|$|Aspasia, who {{was noted}} for her {{ability as a}} conversationalist and adviser, was accused of corrupting the women of Athens {{in order to satisfy}} Pericles' perversions. The accusations against her were {{probably}} nothing more than unproven slanders, but the whole <b>experience</b> <b>was</b> very bitter for Pericles. Although Aspasia was acquitted thanks to a rare emotional outburst of Pericles, his friend, Phidias, died in prison and another friend of his, Anaxagoras, was attacked by the ecclesia for his religious beliefs.|$|E

5|$|Each {{show is a}} {{synthesis}} of circus styles from around the world, with its own central theme and storyline. Shows employ continuous live music, with performers rather than stagehands changing the props. After financial successes and failures in the late 1980s, Nouvelle <b>Expérience</b> <b>was</b> created – with the direction of Franco Dragone – which not only made Cirque du Soleil profitable by 1990, but allowed it to create new shows.|$|E
5|$|Having {{learned about}} the block-booking studio system that almost {{guaranteed}} the studios huge profits, Cagney was determined to spread the wealth. He regularly sent money and goods to old friends from his neighborhood, {{though he did not}} generally make this known. His insistence on no more than four films a year was based on his having witnessed actors—even teenagers—regularly being worked 100 hours a week to turn out more films. This <b>experience</b> <b>was</b> an integral reason for his involvement in forming the Screen Actors Guild in 1933.|$|E
5|$|His first {{business}} <b>experience</b> <b>was</b> in {{the bond}} department of Continental Illinois National Bank, where he worked days while attending the Booth School of Business MBA program at night.

5|$|In December 1811, Maria MacGregor died. At {{a stroke}} MacGregor lost his {{main source of}} income {{and the support of}} the {{influential}} Bowater family. His choices were, Sinclair suggests, limited: announcing his engagement to another heiress so soon after Maria's death might draw embarrassing public protests from the Bowaters, and returning home to farm the MacGregor lands in Scotland would be in his mind unacceptably dull. His only real <b>experience</b> <b>was</b> military, but the manner of his exit from the British Army would make a return there awkward at best.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Worsley {{was part}} of a yacht and ship {{delivery}} company, Imray Laurie Norie & Wilson Limited. His personal <b>experience</b> <b>was</b> a key selling point in the company's commercial literature. In 1937, the company completed over 50 delivery voyages.

50|$|Further {{blurring}} {{the lines of}} behavioral spheres, Gabriel Weimann wrote that media scholars have found that virtual <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> very similar to real-life experiences, and people can confuse their own memories and have trouble remembering if those <b>experiences</b> <b>were</b> mediated or not.|$|R
5000|$|In phenomenology, empathy {{describes}} {{the experience of}} something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and other. This draws on the sense of agency.

In most other respects, however, the <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> modified so that what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> as being the other's experience; in <b>experiencing</b> empathy, what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> not [...] "my" [...] experience, even though I <b>experience</b> it.

5|$|Opinions were {{generally}} favorable towards FreeSpace 2s multiplayer implementation. SquadWar received favorable {{responses from the}} reviewers who were impressed by its persistent nature and statistics tracking. While the required registration with PXO was considered a troublesome process by a few, the gameplay itself was a smooth experience with no lag at all. Other reviewers' experiences with lag were different. Reynolds of Combatsim.com said Internet gaming was laggy with ships jumping places, but LAN gaming was smooth sailing. GameSpy's reviewer said lag became more apparent on a dial-up connection during a multiplayer mission with four or more players.
