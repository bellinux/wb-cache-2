25|$|Traditionally rods {{are made}} from bamboo, while {{contemporary}} rods are usually made from fibreglass or carbon fibre. In contrast with nets, which are usually used in subsistence and commercial fishing, fishing rods are more often used in recreational fishing and competitive casting. Fishing rods come in many sizes, actions, lengths and configurations depending on whether {{they are to be}} used for small, medium or large fish or in different fresh or salt water situations. Various types of fishing rods are designed for specific types of fishing. Fly rods are used to cast artificial <b>flies,</b> <b>spinning</b> rods and bait casting rods are designed to cast baits or lures. Ice fishing rods are designed to fish through small holes in ice covered lakes. Trolling rods are designed to drag bait or lures behind moving boats.|$|R
5000|$|In Nintendo's {{video games}} Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario 3D Land, New Super Mario Bros. 2 and Super Mario 3D World, Mario can wear a [...] "Tanooki Suit". By doing so, he {{takes on the}} {{appearance}} of a tanuki and gains the ability to <b>fly,</b> <b>spin</b> his tail to attack enemies, and shape-shift into a statue, much like a bake-danuki. The same games also feature the [...] "Super Leaf", which gives Mario tanuki ears and tails and allows him to fly and use his tail to attack, although this form is known as Raccoon Mario; in Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World, Mario can only transform into his Tanooki form after obtaining a Super Leaf. This power up is based on the mythology of tanuki using leaves to help themselves transform.|$|R

The makers of the stock footage added some cartoon sounds to the video to entertain people.|$|R

While it was designed as an apogee kick motor and as such it <b>flew</b> in <b>spin</b> stabilized mode, it was also adapted to the Long March 1D third stage. It was paired with a RCS in a similar solution to the CTS.|$|R

50|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} from Cold Bay Airport on the Alaska Peninsula {{for a flight}} across the {{northern}} Pacific Ocean to Seattle, Washington with ten passengers, {{the crew of the}} Electra noted an unusual vibration in the aircraft, but were unable to isolate the source. As the aircraft climbed from FL190 (approximately 19,000 ft) to FL250 (approximately 25,000 ft), the flight engineer left the cockpit to visually check the engines from the passenger cabin, but saw nothing amiss. The flight attendant went into the cockpit to discuss the vibration, which suddenly increased in intensity as she went back into the cabin. She looked out a window {{just in time to see}} the propeller of No. 4 engine (the outboard engine on the right wing) detach itself and <b>fly</b> <b>spinning</b> under the fuselage. The propeller tore a gash 8 ft long in the aircraft's belly, causing the cabin to depressurize and jamming the flight controls and engine throttle controls. The pilots managed to gain some control of the aircraft by using the autopilot and diverted the aircraft to Anchorage. With the engine throttle controls jammed at cruise power, on approach to land the crew were able to make the aircraft descend and climb after shutting down No. 2 (the left inboard) engine in combination with lowering and raising the landing gear.|$|R

She has wild black hair from which hairpins <b>fly</b> and <b>spin</b> in midair, whenever she zooms off on her broom or cackles in glee over her next evil scheme, and she wears a crumpled black hat.

50|$|The Diadocidiidae are {{a family}} of flies (Diptera).Two genera with over 20 species are described. Diadocidiidae are found worldwide, except in Africa and Antarctica.

50|$|The thrower {{holds the}} valari {{by one of}} its limbs and throws it. There are several ways of {{throwing}} and aiming. It is usually given a spin while throwing. While flying through the air, it can maneuver and execute several types of movements according to the throwers purpose. It may spin in the vertical axis, horizontal axis, or just <b>fly</b> without <b>spinning.</b> The spin may also vary in speed. A lethal throw is given a spin and aimed at the neck. A non-lethal throw is given a spin and aimed at the ankles or knees. This is to capture a fleeing victim. A simple hurting blow {{does not have any}} spin.|$|R
