500|$|The episode {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics and viewers. Reviewers generally disliked the episode's humor, but were {{positive about the}} more serious moments. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club believed that the show's concept, which allowed only two characters and a single scene, was [...] "ambitious" [...] but that the end result was [...] "flaccid." [...] He commented that with no cut-away gags or side plots, the episode was [...] "basically everything critics of the show would like the show to have" [...] but was deprived of Family Guys trademark fast pace and reduced to [...] "a series of what amounts to grossout comedy sketches." [...] Television critic Ramsey Isler of IGN added that the gross-out humor [...] "didn't work for me" [...] and found the [...] "more serious stuff" [...] in the episode {{to be the most}} entertaining. Said Isler, [...] "the addition of more dramatic themes and the elimination of the cutaway gags really showed what this show could be if Seth [...] and team put more effort in." [...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Isler listed [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as being [...] "surprisingly dramatic," [...] and, [...] "had {{it not been for the}} extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad was also [...] "more than a little disturbed" [...] by the amount of time spent on Stewie's soiled diaper. However, he noted, [...] "I didn't laugh much at 'Brian & Stewie', but I found myself absolutely captured by their discussion throughout the episode." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "tedious, predictably vulgar, and, by the end, sentimental." [...] Adam Rosenberg of MTV wrote, [...] "Beneath all of the more disturbing elements there's actually some very thoughtful, mature discussion of suicide and what love means amidst it all." [...] Andrew Hanson of The Los Angeles Times found the soiled diaper gag [...] "too sick to watch" [...] and [...] "the grossest" [...] moment featured in Family Guy so far, but conceded that that may have been the producer's intention. Still, Hanson described Brian's suicidal confession as [...] "deep" [...] and stated, [...] "Itâ€™s nice to see that Family Guy is still trying new things and going out on a limb even at episode No. 150." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number seven on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and said he [...] "loved" [...] this episode due its feature of Brian and Stewie's relationship. He added that the episode was [...] "particularly great" [...] because it featured no cutaway gags and was a two-hander, noting that [...] "Clearly, the writers <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> fans want." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ideally, all {{employees}} {{of a firm}} would have one-on-one communication with each other so they <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> other workers are doing. A firm with a single worker does not require any communication between employees. A firm with two workers requires one communication channel, directly between those two workers. A firm with three workers requires three communication channels between employees (between employees A & B, B & C, and A & C). Here is a chart of one-on-one communication channels required: ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2001, Lawler's then-wife Stacy [...] "The Kat" [...] Carter was {{released}} by the WWF, and Lawler quit the company in protest. In his account, there was no clear notice as to why she was fired; when Jim Ross broke the news to him, he stated that the Creative Team simply said that Stacy had [...] "an attitude problem." [...] Vince McMahon told Lawler {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> attitude problem was, and failed to straighten the issue to the Lawlers. Considering that McMahon was Head of the Talent Creative Team, Lawler found it highly suspicious that McMahon then allowed him simply to quit, as if McMahon knew it would happen.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{supporting}} Palmer's {{contention of}} wastefulness is readily available. [...] Unfortunately, Colonel Westbrook did not possess {{many of the}} organizational or management skills necessary to successfully and efficiently supervise his division. On two separate occasions the mutual housing program's projects and efforts were brought before the scrutiny of the Truman Committee investigating waste and corruption in the National Defense Program. Contractors for mutual housing projects in New Jersey did particularly poor jobs and completed the projects substantially over budget. Bids were also badly mishandled by the Mutual Ownership Division. Senator Truman himself became so disgusted by {{the management of the}} mutual housing program that in answer to a witness' statement that he did not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Mutual Ownership Division did, Truman was recorded as saying that, [...] "They (Mutual Ownership Division) don't either, so proceed." ...|$|E
2500|$|It may be {{the case}} that a player does not <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> payoffs of the game are or of what type his opponents are. This sort of game has {{incomplete}} information. In extensive form it is represented as a game with complete but imperfect information using the so-called Harsanyi transformation. This transformation introduces to the game the notion of nature's choice or God's choice. Consider a game consisting of an employer considering whether to hire a job applicant. The job applicant's ability might be one of two things: high or low. His ability level is random; he is low ability with probability 1/3 and high ability with probability 2/3. In this case, it is convenient to model nature as another player of sorts who chooses the applicant's ability according to those probabilities. Nature however does not have any payoffs. [...] Nature's choice is represented in the game tree by a non-filled node. Edges coming from a nature's choice node are labelled with the probability of the event it represents occurring.|$|E

5000|$|The track may be {{considered}} an autobiographical account of Edwards' attempts to hold down any meaningful relationships. [...] "Revol" [...] is [...] "lover" [...] spelt backwards.

2500|$|Back at the school, Dr. Harris {{successfully}} {{removes the}} harness from Mike's son, {{with the help}} of Anne, Dai and Lourdes. [...] Harris explains that he figured out why children always died in previous attempts to remove the harnesses: [...] they synthesize some sort of drug into the body, stimulating the brain's nerve receptors in some way that facilitates mind-control. [...] Whatever this drug is, suddenly being separated from it made children die of shock. [...] Harris theorized that while they didn't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> drug was, it must have vaguely similar effects as other drugs that stimulate the cognitive centers of the brain, such as morphine. [...] Injecting a child with a large dose of morphine before removing the harness would serve as a [...] "bridge" [...] to safely transition off of the alien drug without fatally shocking the brain, after which the child could be incrementally weaned off the morphine. [...] Using this procedure, Harris and Anne are able to successfully cut the harness off Mike's son without killing him. [...] However, Harris says {{that it is impossible to}} remove the tips of the needles that have fused into the child's spine: [...] the points of the needles seem to be some sort of nanotechnology that grows into the spine the longer it is present.|$|E

2500|$|The {{editor who}} {{originally}} approved the cartoons, Carsten Juste, later {{declared that the}} opponents of free speech had [...] "won" [...] because the furor would almost undoubtedly deter future editors from printing anything similar.

6000|$|Mr. Taylor is {{reckoned}} {{a brilliant}} conversationist; but I suppose he requires somebody to draw {{him out and}} assist him; for I could hear nothing that I thought very remarkable on this occasion.

March thought he recognized the very flat in which he had disciplined the surly janitor, but he did not tell his wife; he made her notice the transition character of the street, which had been mostly built up in apartment-houses, with here and there a single dwelling dropped far down beneath and beside them, to that jag-toothed effect on the sky-line so often observable in such New York streets. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> old gentleman bought here for," [...] he said, as they waited on the steps after ringing, [...] "unless he expects to turn it into flats by-and-by.
