5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: the swing phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement <b>is</b> <b>sound,</b> symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
5|$|In 1111, {{according}} to the eleventhfourteenth-century Annals of Inisfallen, Domnall mac Taidc seized the kingship of the Isles by force. This annal-entry is the only notice of Domnall's lordship in the Isles preserved by Irish sources. This could indicate that the chronicle's aforesaid account of the petitioning of Muirchertach is incorrectly dated, and actually refers to about 1111. However, {{the fact that the}} chronicle places the petitioning during a period of new-found Uí Briain dominance in the region, before Magnús' arrival in the Isles, and {{at about the same time}} as Amlaíb's death, suggests that the chronicle's chronology concerning these events <b>is</b> <b>sound,</b> and that Domnall's seizure of the kingship in 1111 was indeed a return to the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Rick Holland, an {{instructor}} at The Master's College and Seminary and pastor of College and Student Ministries at Grace Community Church, criticized the Ludys' description of dating, claiming it was based too much on anecdotes and not enough on the Bible. Nonetheless, he commended the couple on the relevant Bible verses they do quote and {{he argued that the}} advice the Ludys share in the book <b>is</b> <b>sound</b> and that their story is an encouraging one.|$|E
2500|$|Train horns <b>are</b> <b>sounded</b> where {{a whistle}} post (marked {{with the letter}} [...] "S" [...] for [...] "siffler") is present. If the whistle post is {{labelled}} [...] "J" [...] (meaning [...] "jour"), the horn is only to <b>be</b> <b>sounded</b> between 0700 and 2000. Horns must also <b>be</b> <b>sounded</b> when passing an oncoming train, and shortly before reaching the last car of the train.|$|R

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Henkin {{proved that}} the standard deductive system for first-order logic <b>is</b> <b>sound,</b> complete, and effective for second-order logic with Henkin semantics, and the deductive system with comprehension and choice principles <b>is</b> <b>sound,</b> complete, and effective for Henkin semantics using only models that satisfy these principles.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} {{system is}} called LJ. It <b>is</b> <b>sound</b> and complete {{with respect to}} intuitionistic logic and admits a similar cut-elimination proof. This {{can be used in}} proving disjunction and existence properties.|$|E

5000|$|Within the Qur'an, {{written in}} Arabic, {{instances}} of onomatopoeia are documented. Out of about 77,701 words there are 9 {{words that are}} onomatopoeic, 3 which <b>are</b> animal <b>sounds</b> (ex. mooing), 2 which <b>are</b> <b>sounds</b> of nature (ex. thunder)  and 4 that <b>are</b> human <b>sounds</b> (ex. Whisper or groan.) ...|$|R
500|$|The reverse {{depicts the}} Old Belfry, located in Lexington, where a bell <b>was</b> <b>sounded</b> to {{assemble}} the local militia. The belfry was not then old, having been built following the donation of a bell weighing [...] by Isaac Stone {{to the town of}} Lexington in 1761. The bell <b>was</b> <b>sounded</b> after Revere and Dawes arrived, but when no British soldiers appeared, Captain John Parker sent his men home, with instructions to remain ready. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>sounded</b> again at 5:30 am, when word came the British were not far away.|$|R
25|$|By the {{definition}} of provability, there are no sentences provable other than by {{being a member of}} , an axiom, or following by a rule; so if all of those are semantically implied, the deduction calculus <b>is</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ultrasound <b>is</b> <b>sound</b> waves with {{frequencies}} {{higher than}} the upper audible limit of human hearing. Ultrasound {{is no different from}} 'normal' (audible) sound in its physical properties, except in that humans cannot hear it. Ultrasound devices operate with frequencies from 20 kHz up to several gigahertz.|$|E
25|$|The {{resolution}} rule is {{a single}} rule of inference that, together with unification, <b>is</b> <b>sound</b> and complete for first-order logic. As with the tableaux method, a formula is proved by showing that the negation of the formula is unsatisfiable. Resolution is commonly used in automated theorem proving.|$|E
25|$|The {{deductive}} systems {{considered by}} Shapiro (1991) and Henkin (1950) {{add to the}} augmented first-order deductive scheme both comprehension axioms and choice axioms. These axioms <b>are</b> <b>sound</b> for standard second-order semantics. They <b>are</b> <b>sound</b> for Henkin semantics if only Henkin models that satisfy the comprehension and choice axioms are considered.|$|R
50|$|The {{problem with}} the {{argument}} is that it <b>is</b> not <b>sound.</b> In order for a deductive argument to <b>be</b> <b>sound,</b> the deduction must be valid and all the premises true.|$|R

25|$|On May 12, 2016, Switchfoot {{announced}} that the album, titled Where the Light Shines Through, would be released on July 8, 2016. It was produced by Switchfoot and John Fields, with whom the band has worked on The Beautiful Letdown, Nothing <b>Is</b> <b>Sound</b> and Oh! Gravity..|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} issued on July 2008, the IMF noted that Morocco's {{financial}} sector <b>is</b> <b>sound</b> and resilient to shocks, and that the remarkable fiscal consolidation efforts of recent years have allowed the Moroccan economy to absorb the impact of difficult international economic conditions and increasing global prices for essential commodities such as petroleum and energy.|$|E
25|$|A rule of {{inference}} states that, given {{a particular}} formula (or set of formulas) {{with a certain}} property as a hypothesis, another specific formula (or set of formulas) can be derived as a conclusion. The rule <b>is</b> <b>sound</b> (or truth-preserving) if it preserves validity {{in the sense that}} whenever any interpretation satisfies the hypothesis, that interpretation also satisfies the conclusion.|$|E

25|$|A {{deductive}} {{system for}} a logic {{is a set of}} inference rules and logical axioms that determine which sequences of formulas constitute valid proofs. Several deductive systems can be used for second-order logic, although none can be complete for the standard semantics (see below). Each of these systems <b>is</b> <b>sound,</b> which means any sentence they can be used to prove is logically valid in the appropriate semantics.|$|E
25|$|A {{deductive}} system <b>is</b> <b>sound</b> if any {{formula that}} can be derived in the system is logically valid. Conversely, a deductive system is complete if every logically valid formula is derivable. All of the systems {{discussed in this article}} are both sound and complete. They also share the property {{that it is possible to}} effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called effective.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{structure}} of the history itself <b>is</b> <b>sound,</b> as most things are added with an eye to how they fit in with everything that is already known. As a result, the SFU has a history that covers (in various products) a span of about 130 years. Thanks to Steve Cole being the guiding influence from start to finish, the SFU has far fewer inconsistencies than the canon Star Trek universe.|$|E

50|$|An organ pipe, or a {{harpsichord}} string, {{designated as}} eight-foot pitch <b>is</b> <b>sounded</b> at standard, ordinary pitch. For example, the A above middle C in eight-foot pitch would <b>be</b> <b>sounded</b> at 440 Hz (or at some similar value, {{depending on how}} concert pitch was set {{at the time and}} place the organ or harpsichord was made).|$|R
50|$|Intracranially heard <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> heard inside one's head but the <b>sound</b> <b>is</b> in fact outside. This {{can be solved}} by adding {{reverberation}} cues.|$|R
25|$|It {{is easy to}} {{see that}} the steps in the tree {{preserve}} the semantic truth value of the formulas implied by them, with conjunction understood between the tree's different branches whenever there is a split. It is also obvious that an axiom is provable if and only if it is true for every truth values of the atomic symbols. Thus this system <b>is</b> <b>sound</b> and complete in propositional logic.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., {{a charismatic}} Republican presidential hopeful, Senator Jasper Irving, has invited liberal TV {{journalist}} Janine Roth {{to his office}} to announce a new war strategy in Afghanistan: the use of small units to seize strategic positions in the mountains ("forward operating points") before the Taliban can occupy them. The senator hopes that Roth's positive coverage will help convince the public that the plan <b>is</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
25|$|This hypothesis, {{created to}} explain palaeomagnetic data, {{suggests}} that Earth's {{axis of rotation}} shifted one or more times during the general time-frame attributed to snowball Earth. This could feasibly produce the same distribution of glacial deposits without requiring any of them to have been deposited at equatorial latitude. While the physics behind the proposition <b>is</b> <b>sound,</b> the removal of one flawed data point from the original study rendered {{the application of the}} concept in these circumstances unwarranted.|$|E
