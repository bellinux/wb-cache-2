40|$|Abstract — This letter {{considers}} the multicast scheduling {{problem for the}} case where the average rates of flows are known and a fixed frame size is applicable. We present a frame-based decomposition method for computing offline a recurring schedule that can guarantee the specified flow rates with minimum internal speedup, if any. We consider both the no-splitting case, where a multicast cell must be transferred to all <b>its</b> <b>destinations</b> in a single time slot, and the fanout-splitting case, where a multicast cell may take multiple time slots to transfer to all <b>its</b> <b>destinations,</b> transferring only to a subset of <b>its</b> <b>destinations</b> each time.

5|$|Unknown to Johnson and Hunt, {{the letter}} was intercepted by {{government}} spies and copied before being sent to <b>its</b> <b>destination.</b> The contents were interpreted to mean that an insurrection was being planned, and the government responded by ordering the 15th Hussars to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1914, Newland {{transferred}} to the newly raised Australian Imperial Force following the British Empire's declaration of war on Germany and her allies. Assigned to the 12th Battalion, he was made its regimental quartermaster sergeant and embarked from Hobart aboard HMAT Geelong on 20 October, bound for Egypt. Following a brief stop in Western Australia, the troopship arrived at <b>its</b> <b>destination</b> seven weeks later. The 12th Battalion spent the following four months training in the Egyptian desert.|$|E

5|$|Wallace and {{the crew}} spent ten days in an open boat before being {{picked up by the}} brig Jordeson, which was sailing from Cuba to London.

5|$|Australian coastwatchers {{stationed}} on New Britain were reinforced during September and October 1943 {{to provide}} warning of air attacks from Rabaul {{bound for the}} Allied landing sites and to report on Japanese barge and troop movements. In addition to a coastwatching team already in place at Cape Orford near Wide Bay, five other parties were sent to Cape Hoskins, Gasmata, Open Bay (on the north coast {{at the base of}} the Gazelle Peninsula), the area south of Wide Bay, and the neck between Wide Bay and Open Bay. The Gasmata party was discovered by the Japanese while en route to <b>its</b> <b>destination</b> and eliminated, but the other teams were in place by the end of October.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This letter {{considers}} the multicast scheduling {{problem for the}} case where the average rates of flows are known and a fixed frame size is applicable. We present a frame-based decomposition method for computing offline a recurring schedule that can guarantee the specified flow rates with minimum internal speedup, if any. We consider both the no-splitting case, where a multicast cell must be transferred to all <b>its</b> <b>destinations</b> in a single time slot, and the fanout-splitting case, where a multicast cell may take multiple time slots to transfer to all <b>its</b> <b>destinations,</b> transferring only to a subset of <b>its</b> <b>destinations</b> each time. Index Terms—Multicast switching, high-performance switches, rate guarantees. Recently, Sundararajan et al. [4] extended the BvN decomposition approach to support multicast switching. This method retains the generality of the BvN approach in that it can support any flow rates specified as non-negative real numbers, but it also inherits the worst-case online memory requirement of the BvN approach {{and the need for}} online scheduling using PGPS. Our work is complementary in that it provides a simpler solution in cases where integer flow rates and a fixed frame size apply. To our knowledge, previous frame-based offline scheduling methods did not consider multicast switching. I...|$|R

5|$|Before {{the tunnel}} had been completed, the American POWs were {{transferred}} to Oflag 64 in Szubin, Poland. Juskalian estimated that if the tunnel had been dug for another 100feet, it would reach <b>its</b> <b>destination</b> {{at the bank of}} the Fulda River. Two American POWs pretended to be sick in order to remain in the Rotenburg camp and to continue working on the tunnel and ultimately escape. The two Americans, who eventually rejoined the rest of the American POWs in Oflag 64, relayed the news that the tunnel had been discovered by the German guards who had learned of its existence after planting a spy among the POWs.|$|E
5|$|Fénix {{was part}} of a {{squadron}} of eleven ships-of-the-line, accompanied by two frigates and two tartanes, sent to collect the new king, Carlos III, from Naples in 1759. Under Captain Gutierra de Hevia y Valdés and as the flagship of Lieutenant General Juan Jose Navarro, she set sail from Cádiz on 29August. The squadron passed through the Straits of Gibraltar on 2September, before stopping at Cartagena on 10September to pick up supplies. On 28September it arrived at <b>its</b> <b>destination,</b> where it was reinforced with five other men-of-war. The King embarked on 7October, and the squadron arrived in Barcelona on 17October.|$|E
5|$|He {{was made}} {{commander-in-chief}} in the Leeward Islands Station {{and given the}} task of transporting a large troop convoy. Twice he attempted the crossing of the Atlantic, and twice he was forced back by severe gales which ravaged his fleet and wrecked {{a number of the}} merchant ships in the convoy. He made a third attempt in 1796, and succeeded in shepherding the fleet to <b>its</b> <b>destination.</b> He was then active in using the troops and his naval forces to capture the islands of Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and Grenada, before returning to England. He was made second in command at the Cape of Good Hope in 1797, succeeding to commander-in-chief the following year, and he died while in command there in November 1798.|$|E

50|$|In late April 2009, WestJet {{temporarily}} suspended {{service to}} several of <b>its</b> <b>destinations</b> in Mexico due to the outbreak of influenza A (H1N1) in the country.

5|$|On 5 December 1914, Shackleton's {{expedition}} ship Endurance left South Georgia for the Weddell Sea, on {{the first}} stage of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. It was making for Vahsel Bay, the southernmost explored point of the Weddell Sea at 77° 49' S, where a shore party was to land and prepare for a transcontinental crossing of Antarctica. Before it could reach <b>its</b> <b>destination</b> the ship was trapped in pack ice, and by 14 February 1915 was held fast, despite prolonged efforts to free her. During the following eight months she drifted northward until, on 27 October, she was crushed by the pack's pressure, finally sinking on 21 November.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to his bush camp, Wilson sent a further message to the laager, which reached <b>its</b> <b>destination</b> at around 23:00: Napier, Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners. Wilson repeated {{that he was going}} to stay north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning. Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also felt he could not recall Wilson, as to do so would be to lose Lobengula for sure.|$|E
5|$|Potemkin reached <b>its</b> <b>destination</b> at 23:00 on 7 July and the Romanians {{agreed to}} give asylum to the crew if they would disarm {{themselves}} and surrender the battleship. Ismails crew decided the following morning to return to Sevastopol and turn themselves in, but Potemkins crew voted to accept the terms. Captain Negru, commander of the port, came aboard at noon and hoisted the Romanian flag and then allowed the ship to enter the inner harbor. Before the crew disembarked, Matushenko ordered that the Potemkins Kingston valves be opened so Potemkin would sink to the bottom.|$|E
50|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and the {{collapse}} of communism in East Europe saw a vast {{reduction in the number of}} international services offered.

A sandstone structure discovered at 650 m depth seems to hint at a former sand beach and shoreline.|$|R
