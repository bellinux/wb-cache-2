5|$|European {{settlers}} on the North American Prairies {{found that}} the sod least likely to deteriorate due to freezing or rain came from dried sloughs. Turf was once extensively used for the walls of houses in Ireland, Scotland and Iceland, where some turf houses may still be found. A turf <b>house</b> <b>may</b> last fifty years or longer if well-maintained in a cold climate.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} alleged witches' coven in English legal history {{took place in}} Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612. Eight of those {{attending}} were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The <b>house</b> <b>may</b> have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.|$|E

5|$|The gardens {{behind the}} <b>house</b> <b>may</b> {{originally}} have resembled the gardens at Bodysgallen Hall, which {{were laid out}} in the Renaissance style popular across Europe. The slope of the land results in Plas Mawr's gardens forming the upper and lower terraces, and these have been replanted and restored in an attempt to show them as they might have appeared in 1665. The summerhouse is based on a version shown in a contemporary painting of Llanerch's gardens, and the flowerpots are modeled on those found in excavations at Tredegar House.|$|E
5|$|By the 1330s, Southampton's {{prosperity}} {{was in a}} slow decline. In 1338 {{there was}} a successful French attack on the town, during which various buildings were burned and castle was damaged. The <b>house</b> <b>may</b> {{have been one of}} those damaged in the raid, as the south-western corner of the building collapsed around that time and had to be quickly rebuilt; other alterations, including the addition of a fireplace, may have been carried out at the same time. Southampton's economy collapsed {{in the aftermath of the}} attacks and never fully recovered. The character of FrenchStreet began to change, as many houses were sub-divided or redeveloped to fit in more buildings. The Medieval Merchant's House ceased to be used by major merchants and by 1392 appears to have been rented out to tenants by Thomas Fryke and John Barflet, the latter a descendent of John Fortin, for whom the house was originally built.|$|E
5|$|If the Governor General of Canada {{is unable}} to give assent, {{it can be done}} by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada—the Chief Justice of Canada—or another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. It is not {{actually}} necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature, the signature being merely an attestation. In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law. Two methods are available: the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament; alternatively, each <b>house</b> <b>may</b> be notified separately, usually by the speaker of that house. However, though both houses must be notified on the same day, notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the Journals of the House of Commons, whereas the Senate must be sitting and the governor general's letter read aloud by the speaker.|$|E

5|$|The Avery Homestead is {{a two-story}} Colonial-style home in Ledyard, Connecticut {{that was built}} circa 1696. Evidence {{suggests}} that the <b>house</b> <b>may</b> have begun as a single-story, one-room house and later expanded to a two-story, two-room house by 1726. The house underwent major additions and renovations by Theophilus Avery and later his grandson, Theophilus Avery. In the mid-1950s, Amos Avery began a decade-long restoration effort to return the house to its 18th-century appearance. The Avery Homestead is historically significant as a well-preserved example of an 18th-century farmhouse with fine craftsmanship. The home is also historically important because more than twelve generations of the Avery family have resided there {{over the course of}} three centuries. The Avery Homestead was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Neither <b>House</b> <b>may</b> adjourn, {{without the}} consent of the other, for more than three days. Often, a House will hold pro forma {{sessions}} every three days; such sessions are merely held to fulfill the constitutional requirement, and not to conduct business. Furthermore, neither <b>House</b> <b>may</b> meet in any place other than that designated for both Houses (the Capitol), {{without the consent}} of the other House.|$|E

25|$|In a more {{contemporary}} {{version of the}} Chinese model, a courtyard can {{also can be used}} to separate a home into wings; for example, one wing of the <b>house</b> <b>may</b> be for entertaining/dining, and the other wing may be for sleeping/family/privacy. This is exemplified by the Hooper House in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E

25|$|Each House can {{determine}} its own Rules (assuming a quorum is present), and may punish {{any of its}} members. A two-thirds vote is necessary to expel a member.

25|$|The House {{generally}} {{adheres to}} the following order of priority as outlined in the House Rules, specifically Rule XIV during the 114th Congress, but variations exist to this order {{as a result of}} House Rules or parliamentary rules that take precedence.

25|$|The {{remains of}} a villa were found close to the river in 1973 in the {{adjacent}} village of Northchurch. The oldest building, made of timber, was built in AD60, rebuilt using stone in the early 2nd century, and enlarged to a ten-room building around AD150. The <b>house</b> <b>may</b> have been empty for a period, reoccupied in the 4th century, and abandoned in the late 4th or early 5th century.|$|E

25|$|This {{establishes}} the method for making Acts of Congress that involve taxation. Accordingly, any bill may originate in either House of Congress, {{except for a}} revenue bill, which may originate only in the House of Representatives. In practice, the Senate sometimes circumvents this requirement by substituting the text of a revenue bill previously passed by the House with a substitute text. Either <b>House</b> <b>may</b> amend any bill, including revenue and appropriation bills.|$|E
25|$|His {{third wife}} was Katherine Maria, {{daughter}} of George Powney Thompson, {{also of the}} Bengal Civil Service. They had seven children: Fendall, who played cricket for the Gentlemen of Kent and became a Major-General, Harriet Sophia, Susan Mary, Katherine Louisa, Mabel Thornton, Hugh Penton and Rivers Grenfell. The 1861 and 1871 British Census returns show him living at the Manor <b>House,</b> <b>May</b> Place, Crayford, Kent, England with his third wife Katharine Maria and the first six of his seven children by that marriage.|$|E
25|$|These {{interior}} poles, typically 7 to 10 feet in height, {{are usually}} shorter than exterior poles. The interior posts support the roof beam of a clan house {{and include a}} large notch at the top, where the beam can rest. A clan <b>house</b> <b>may</b> have two to four or more house posts, depending on the native group who built it. Carvings on these poles, {{like those of the}} house frontal poles, are often used as a storytelling device for children and help {{tell the story of the}} owners' family history.|$|E
