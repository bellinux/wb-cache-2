50|$|Forming limit curves (FLC) {{for four}} steel sheet grades are {{displayed}} in the attached figure. All forming limit curves have essentially the same shape. A minimum of the curve exists at the intercept with the major strain axis or close thereby, the plane strain forming limit. With {{the definition of the}} onset of local necking (e. g. membrane force reaches an extreme value) and the assumption of a hardening law according to Hollomon (σ = K εn) it can be shown that the corresponding theoretical plane strain forming limit is identical with the strain hardening coefficient, n. There is no thickness effect. Taking into account the strain rate sensitivity of the material, which is obvious in steel, along with the sheet thickness, the fact can be explained that practical forming limits, obtained by the use of the above described method, lie well above theoretical forming limits. Thus the basic influence parameters for the forming limits are, the strain <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent,</b> n, the initial sheet thickness, t0 and the strain rate hardening coefficient, m. The lankford coefficient, r, which defines the plastic anisotropy of the material, has two effects on the forming limit curve. On the left side there is no influence except that the curve extends to larger values, on the right hand side increasing r values reduce the forming limits.|$|E

40|$|Large rocket {{cryogenic}} tank domes have typically been fabricated using Al-Cu based alloys like Al-Cu alloy 2219. The use of aluminum-lithium based alloys for rocket fuel tank domes can reduce weight because aluminum-lithium alloys have lower density and higher strength than Al-Cu alloy 2219. However, Al-Li alloys have rarely {{been used to}} fabricate rocket fuel tank domes because of the inherent low formability characteristic that make them susceptible to cracking during the forming operations. The ability to form metal by stretch forming or spin forming without excessive thinning or necking depends on the strain <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> "n". The stain <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> {{is a measure of}} how rapidly a metal becomes stronger and harder. A high strain <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> is beneficial to a material's ability to uniformly distribute the imposed strain. Marshall Space Flight Center has developed a novel annealing process that can achieve a work <b>hardening</b> <b>exponent</b> on the order of 0. 27 to 0. 29, which is approximately 50 % higher than what is typically obtained for Al-Li alloys using the conventional method.

40|$|AbstractCleavage {{fracture}} of steel {{is governed by}} micromechanical mechanisms, but it is modelled with simple continuum- level models. These models are starting to reach {{the limits of their}} applicability, so there is interest to look deeper into micromechanical modelling of fracture processes. In order to model fracture on the microstructural level, a plasticity model of the grains themselves is needed. In prior studies, a method of finding the single-crystal properties by an inverse engineering approach has been described. By this method, a single crystal is indented, and the material input to a FE model of the experiment is iteratively changed until agreement is achieved. These prior studies have shown that methods like this provide ambiguous results. In this paper, the uniqueness of the solution is assessed by evaluating the difference between experiments and simulations for a variety of material input parameters. The results show that with a power law hardening relationship, martensite produces two unique minima (at n= 0 and 0. 1). This may represent the Lüder's plateau and the subsequent hardening, respectively.

40|$|Pre-deformation and post-deformation {{microstructure}} characterization {{was conducted}} on tempered 4340 steel and commercial pure copper specimens under impact to determine the microstructural changes and the mechanism of grain refinement that occur during the evolution of ASBs. It was observed that the movement and multiplication of dislocations, elongation of grains, breaking of elongated grains, rotation, carbide fragmentation and boundary refinement of broken grains occur simultaneously during the evolution of ASBs in the impacted 4340 steel specimens. The extent of these mechanisms depends on the imposed local strain and strain rate. Extensive grain refinement coupled with high density of dislocations results in the shear band structures being more susceptible to crack nucleation and propagation. In copper, {{it was observed that}} sequential occurrence of emergence of dislocations, dislocation cell formations with varying cell boundaries and cell interiors, dynamic recovery and extensive micro-twinning results {{in the formation of the}} shear bands. The structure within the evolved shear bands becomes less brittle after the onset of dynamic recovery and micro-twinning.

Stainless steel plates were welded using gas tungsten arc welding technique.

Microstructural analyses were performed using techniques including metallography, EDS analysis, and measurement of ferrite content with ferritoscope. Fracture behavior of the weld metals was characterized by conducting tensile tests at 25 and 500 °C, and performing fractographic and microstructural observations using SEM. Transformation of delta-ferrite to the intermetallic sigma phase during aging resulted in a mild increase in tensile strength and significant reduction in ductility. Slant and flat macroscopic fracture modes were observed in the aged weld metals, with the slant mode being dominant at 500 °C.

Three values of deformation (two in the plastic region taking into account the modified Crussard-Jaoul analysis and one after failure) were considered. Fractions of LAGB and HAGB, grain size and grain aspect ratio were calculated and compared for the different ECAP passes and tensile deformation levels. The dislocation density evolution calculated by the Bergström model for both the tensile curves and the ECAP curve showed a higher increase in the amount of dislocations during the initial stages of deformation than at higher values of deformation due to higher probabilities of dislocations annihilation. The strain <b>hardening</b> <b>exponents</b> calculated via the Bergström model for each ECAP pass shows that there is a continuous decrease in the strain hardening capacity until the eighth pass where a small increase with a subsequent stabilization was found.
