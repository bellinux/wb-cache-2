5|$|His ambivalence towards docetism, the heretical {{doctrine}} that Christ's <b>earthly</b> body was an illusion.|$|E
5|$|Mars {{has become}} a kind of mythic arena onto which we have {{projected}} our <b>Earthly</b> hopes and fears.|$|E
5|$|Freitas {{considers}} {{that even if}} an extraterrestrial being were to be afforded legal personhood, problems of nationality and immigration would arise. An extraterrestrial being {{would not have a}} legally recognized <b>earthly</b> citizenship, and drastic legal measures might be required in order to account for the technically illegal immigration of extraterrestrial individuals.|$|E
5|$|In his {{usage of}} grisaille, van der Weyden distinguishes between the <b>earthly</b> realm {{of flesh and}} blood, and the divine, {{represented}} by ancient sculptural figures, who appear frozen in time. Art historian Shirley Blum believes these figures were relegated to the architectural elements {{so as not to}} crowd the central devotional image.|$|E
5|$|The work clearly {{distinguishes between}} {{figures of the}} divine, <b>earthly</b> and hellish realms. Perhaps {{following}} Jan van Eyck's c. 1432 Ghent Altarpiece, the polyptych wings form an inverted T-shape. When the shutters are closed the panels resemble an upside-down cross, a form common in 15th-century carved retables: an elevated central panel allowed additional space for a narrative scene, to depict a heavenly vista, a single large figure, or a crucifixion with space for the cross to extend above the other panels, an innovation seen in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross. This shape echoes typical configuration of Gothic churches, where the naves often extended past the aisles into the apse or choir. The imagery of the outer panels {{is set in the}} <b>earthly</b> realm with the donors, and saints painted in grisaille to imitate sculpture.|$|E
5|$|To most a monarch was God's <b>earthly</b> representative, {{chosen by}} Him {{for the benefit}} of His people. For men to meddle in that choice was to tamper with the divine order, the {{inevitable}} price of which was chaos.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{tradition is}} that of the ship burial, where the deceased was laid in a boat, or a stone ship, and given grave offerings in accordance with his <b>earthly</b> status and profession, sometimes including sacrificed slaves. Afterwards, piles of stone and soil were usually laid on top of the remains {{in order to create a}} tumulus.|$|E
5|$|Banai {{does not}} appear in the Malhari Mahatmya {{originating}} from the Brahmin (high-priest caste) tradition, which glorifies Khandoba as Shiva and de-emphasizes his <b>earthly</b> connections. In contrast, Banai occupies the central position in the Dhangar folk narrative and Mhalsa's marriage to Khandoba is reduced to a passing mention; Marathas and other settled castes give more importance to Mhalsa.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astrology has a close {{relation}} with Chinese philosophy (theory {{of the three}} harmonies: heaven, earth and man) and uses concepts such as yin and yang, the Five phases, the 10 Celestial stems, the 12 <b>Earthly</b> Branches, and shichen (時辰 a form of timekeeping used for religious purposes). The early use of Chinese astrology was mainly confined to political astrology, the observation of unusual phenomena, identification of portents and the selection of auspicious days for events and decisions.|$|E
5|$|I {{will not}} {{disguise}} {{it in the}} least... the fact is, I most eagerly aspire after future eminence in literature, my whole soul burns most ardently after it, and every <b>earthly</b> thought centres in it... I am almost confident in believing, that if I can ever rise in the world it must be by the exercise of my talents in the wide field of literature.|$|E
5|$|In both paintings, Saint Francis of Assisi kneels by a rock as he {{receives}} the stigmata {{that were to}} stay on his body until his death. The composition is tonally similar to Giotto's 1295–1300 Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, but more grounded in <b>earthly</b> reality. The design is a mostly faithful representation of the original Franciscan texts, but differs in that Francis does not lean forward towards Christ.|$|E
5|$|In his teachings, Sai Baba {{emphasised}} {{the importance}} of performing one's duties without attachment to <b>earthly</b> matters and of being content regardless of the situation. In his personal practice, Sai Baba observed worship procedures belonging to Islam; he shunned any kind of regular rituals but allowed the practice of Salah, chanting of Al-Fatiha, and Qur'an readings at Muslim festival times. Occasionally reciting the Al-Fatiha, Baba enjoyed listening to mawlid and qawwali accompanied with the tabla and sarangi twice daily.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict on religion is misguided, and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of <b>earthly</b> perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E
5|$|Religion was an {{important}} part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing dynasty, the Palace of <b>Earthly</b> Harmony became a place of Manchu Shamanist ceremony. At the same time, the native Chinese Taoist religion continued to have {{an important}} role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties. There were two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court.|$|E
5|$|The album embraces {{a form of}} {{symbolism}} {{that would}} eventually become a staple of Morrison's songs, equating <b>earthly</b> love and heaven, or as close as a living being can approach it. Morrison and Davis's upright bass {{can be interpreted as}} the earth opposing Kay's percussion and the string arrangement representing heaven and with Berliner's lead acoustic guitar residing on a plane in between.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of planets}} {{has evolved over}} its history, from the divine lights of antiquity to the <b>earthly</b> objects of the {{scientific}} age. The concept has expanded to include worlds {{not only in the}} Solar System, but in hundreds of other extrasolar systems. The ambiguities inherent in defining planets have led to much scientific controversy.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} festival held at Badrinath Temple is Mata Murti Ka Mela, which commemorates the descent {{of the river}} Ganges on mother earth. The mother of Badrinath, who {{is believed to have}} divided the river into twelve channels for the welfare of <b>earthly</b> beings, is worshiped during the festival. The place where the river flowed became the holy land of Badrinath.|$|E
5|$|The painting's {{historical}} significance rests {{both on the}} skill behind the design and its merging of <b>earthly</b> and divine realms. By positioning himself in the same space as the Madonna, and showing a painter {{in the act of}} portrayal, Van der Weyden brings to the fore the role of artistic creativity in 15th-century society. The panel became widely influential with near copies by the Master of the Legend of Saint Ursula and Hugo van der Goes.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder investigates a small town plagued by deaths in which the bodies are found covered in cockroaches. Working from home, Scully has {{scientific}} explanations for all of them, but Mulder—at the crime scene with an attractive bug expert—suspects the insects may not be organic, or <b>earthly.</b>|$|E
5|$|When André Breton {{wrote his}} first Surrealist Manifesto in 1924, his {{historical}} precedents as inclusions named only Gustave Moreau, Georges Seurat and Uccello. However, the Surrealist movement soon rediscovered Bosch and Breughel, who quickly became popular among the Surrealist painters. René Magritte and Max Ernst both {{were inspired by}} Bosch's The Garden of <b>Earthly</b> Delights.|$|E
5|$|Animal zodiac: The {{earliest}} {{and most}} complete {{version of the}} animal zodiac mentions twelve animals which differ slightly from the modern version (for instance, the Dragon is absent, represented by a worm). Each animal matches the <b>Earthly</b> Branches and were written on bamboo slips from Shuihudi, dated to the late 4th century BC, {{as well as from}} Fangmatan, dating to the late 3rd century BC. Before these archaeological finds, the Lunheng written by Wang Chong (27– c. 100 AD) during the 1st century provided the earliest transmitted example of a complete duodenary animal cycle.|$|E
5|$|From 1865 to 1870, Morris {{worked on}} another epic poem, The <b>Earthly</b> Paradise. Designed as a homage to Chaucer, it {{consisted}} of 24 stories, adopted from an array of different cultures, and each by a different narrator; set in the late 14th century, the synopsis revolved around a group of Norsemen who flee the Black Death by sailing away from Europe, on the way discovering an island where the inhabitants continue to venerate the ancient Greek gods. Published in four parts by F. S. Ellis, it soon gained a cult following and established Morris' reputation as a major poet.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing from heaven, finally aware of the meaninglessness of <b>earthly</b> emotions. About {{a third of the}} lines of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room for a more detailed and characterised narrative.|$|E
5|$|Jesus is {{the central}} figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and <b>earthly</b> life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Tetragrammaton {{issued the}} album in a stark {{gatefold}} sleeve, wrapped {{around with a}} segmented illustration from Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of <b>Earthly</b> Delights. The label ran into difficulty {{over the use of}} the Museo del Prado-owned painting, which was incorrectly perceived in the US as being anti-religious, featuring immoral scenes, and was thus rejected or poorly stocked by many record shops. The original painting is in colour although it appeared on the LP in monochrome due to a printing error for the original layout and the band opted to keep it that way. Another section of the same Bosch painting (in colour) had previously been used as an album cover two years before by Pearls Before Swine on their debut One Nation Underground.|$|E
5|$|The Celestial Masters {{believed}} that qi pervaded everything, {{and in order}} to achieve immortality, the correct balance of qi had to be present within the body. Having a poor quantity of qi in the body, would result in illness, and eventually death. Meditation could be used to restore qi to the body, but sex was to be avoided, as it could result in the loss of qi. If there was the correct balance of qi within the body upon death, an adherent could 'feign death' and be reborn. If not, an adherent would be transported to an <b>earthly</b> prison where he would face eternal torment.|$|E
5|$|The {{paintings}} {{of the first generation}} of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references. Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals. Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the <b>earthly.</b> Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the Life of Mary vastly predominate.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{categories}} of ritual in Lingbao Daoism. The first {{is known as the}} heavenly Golden Register of Rituals, and is carried out to prevent natural disasters. During the Tang Dynasty, this ritual was carried out in honour of the imperial family, but later it could be performed by anyone. The <b>earthly</b> Yellow Register ritual was performed to ensure the dead was at rest. The final type of ritual, which has not survived, was the human Jade Register, which was performed to ensure the salvation of mankind. Of the rituals that have survived, the Golden Register has assumed the role of the Jade register, ensuring salvation and preventing bad weather.|$|E
5|$|They {{may also}} serve as {{religious}} symbols, as when Jonah (Hebrew: יוֹנָה, dove) embodied the fright, passivity, mourning, and beauty traditionally associated with doves. Birds have themselves been deified, {{as in the case}} of the common peacock, which is perceived as Mother Earth by the Dravidians of India. In religious images preserved from the Inca and Tiwanaku empires, birds are depicted in the process of transgressing boundaries between <b>earthly</b> and underground spiritual realms. Indigenous peoples of the central Andes maintain legends of birds passing to and from metaphysical worlds.|$|E
5|$|When the General Assembly {{convened in}} June 1564, an {{argument}} broke out between Knox and Maitland over {{the authority of}} the civil government. Maitland told Knox to refrain from stirring up emotions over Mary's insistence on having mass celebrated and he quoted from Martin Luther and John Calvin about obedience to <b>earthly</b> rulers. Knox retorted that the Bible notes that Israel was punished when it followed an unfaithful king and that the Continental reformers were refuting arguments made by the Anabaptists who rejected all forms of government. The debate revealed his waning influence on political events as the nobility continued to support Mary.|$|E
5|$|Buddhism {{never fully}} {{recovered}} after several major persecutions in China from the 5th through the 10th centuries, although Daoism continued {{to thrive in}} Song China. In northern China under the Jin dynasty after 1127, the Daoist philosopher Wang Chongyang (1113–1170) established the Quanzhen School. Wang's seven disciples, known as the Seven Immortals, gained great fame throughout China. They included the prominent Daoist priestess Sun Bu'er (c. 1119–1182), who became a female role model in Daoism. There was also Qiu Chuji (1148–1227), who founded his own Quanzhen Daoist branch known as Longmen ("Dragon Gate"). In the Southern Song, cult centers of Daoism became popular at mountain sites that were reputed to be the <b>earthly</b> sojourns of Daoist deities; elite families had shrines erected in these mountain retreats {{in honor of the}} local deity thought to reside therein. Much more so than for Buddhist clergy, Daoist priests and holy men were sought when one prayed for having a son, when one was physically ill, or when there was need for change after a long spell of bad weather and poor harvest.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about a renewed interest in his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of <b>Earthly</b> Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music and more to the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that <b>earthly</b> powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E
5|$|Examining the {{symbolism}} in Bosch's art"the freakish riddles … the irresponsible phantasmagoria of an ecstatic"Fränger concluded that his interpretation applied to Bosch's three altarpieces only: The Garden of <b>Earthly</b> Delights, Temptation of Saint Anthony, and The Haywain Triptych. Fränger distinguished these {{pieces from the}} artist's other works and argued that despite their anti-cleric polemic, they were nevertheless all altarpieces, probably commissioned for the devotional purposes of a mystery cult. While commentators accept Fränger's analysis as astute and broad in scope, they have often questioned his final conclusions. These are regarded by many scholars as hypothesis only, and built on an unstable foundation and {{what can only be}} conjecture. Critics argue that artists during this period painted not for their own pleasure but for commission, while the language and secularization of a post-Renaissance mind-set projected onto Bosch would have been alien to the late-Medieval painter.|$|E
5|$|Gods {{were linked}} with {{specific}} {{regions of the}} universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with {{other parts of the}} universe were said to live in those places instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an <b>earthly</b> setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E
