40|$|Abstract in Undetermined <b>Edge</b> <b>sealing</b> {{is often}} used to assure {{one-dimensional}} moisture flow and a defined exposure area in moisture transport experiments. This paper deals with the performance of a number of <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> systems including wax-paraffin mix, epoxy adhesive, silicone and different tapes and films. The overall performance of the sealing systems includes vapor permeability and hygroscopicity, workability, thermal durability, flexibility, adhesion and risk of hydrophobation. The moisture-related properties are determined gravimetrically. The other properties are examined visually and qualitatively. Each of the properties of the <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> systems is rated and the overall performance is an assessment of all the single properties. This comparative study shows that the best overall performance among the studied <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> systems were seen in the tapes and films, the mixes demonstrate a higher risk of hydrophobation.

40|$|PURPOSES: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the disintegration mechanism of concrete due to the infiltration of the moisture to the milling overlay pavement and to come up with a method to minimize the disintegration as well as verifying the effectiveness of the <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and Fogseal method. METHODS: This study investigated the distress mechanism due to the infiltrated moisture remaining in the milling overlay pavement through chloride freezing test and verified the effectiveness of the sealing of the milling <b>edge</b> and fog <b>seal</b> methods, which have been devised to minimize the moisture infiltration, through laboratory water permeability test. Additionally, long-term pavement performance was compared for the effectiveness of the proposed method through under loading test, and field water permeability test was carried out to verify the field applicability of the proposed method. RESULTS: The result of the research confirmed that chloride deteriorates the concrete surface through disintegration and lowers its strength and that the laboratory moisture infiltration test verified the effectiveness of the milling <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and fog seal methods in the deterrence of moisture infiltration to the overlay pavement with excellent long-term performance of the pavement treated with the proposed method. Although the field water permeability test revealed some deterrence of moisture infiltration of the milling <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and fog seal methods to a certain extent, the difference was a little. CONCLUSIONS: The milling <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> and fog seal methods are limited in their effectiveness for the cases of improvident compactio...|$|R
50|$|Another {{widely used}} method to seal through glass with low {{coefficient}} of thermal expansion {{is the use}} of strips of thin molybdenum foil. This can be done with matched coefficients of thermal expansion. Then the edges of the strip also have to be knife sharp. The disadvantage here is that the tip of the edge which is a local point of high tensile stress reaches through the wall of the glass container. This can lead to low gas leakages. In the tube to tube knife <b>edge</b> <b>seal</b> the edge is either outside, inside, or buried into the glass wall.|$|E

40|$|This poster aims at {{presenting}} {{an experimental}} investigations for the fabrication of vacuum glazing using a novel low-temperature <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> material, melts at around 200 C, {{as shown in}} figure 1. To date two materials indium and solder glass have been used for <b>sealing</b> the <b>edges</b> of the glass sheets in a vacuum glazing. Indium is a low temperature sealing material, melts at 157 C, but is very expensive. Solder glass is a high temperature sealing material, melts at around 450 C, but has limitation of using low-e coatings and a tempered glass. One of the main hindrance to the manufacture of vacuum glazing at the industrial level is the cost. In this poster presentation, a vacuum glazing system for production at a laboratory scale using a modified evacuation pump-out sealing technique is presented. A number of samples have been fabricated using a novel cost effective <b>edge</b> <b>sealing</b> material that achieves an evacuation pressure less than 0. 046 Pa in the cavity of the vacuum glazing samples.

40|$|The {{development}} of vacuum glazing represents a significant advancement {{in the area}} of low heat loss glazing systems with the potential to substantially reduce building heating and cooling loads. Vacuum glazing consists of two or more glass panes hermetically sealed together around the edge with a vacuum gap between the panes. To avoid the glass panes from collapsing and touching each other under the influence of atmospheric pressure an array of support pillars is provided between the glass panes. A high level of thermal insulation is achieved by evacuating the spaces between the glass panes to a very low pressure which greatly reduces conduction and convection within the space; therefore heat transfer through this kind of glazing is significantly lower when compared with conventional insulating glazing. However, vacuum glazing is subject to inherent stresses due to atmospheric pressure and temperature differentials which can lead to fracture of the glass panes and failure of the <b>edge</b> <b>seal.</b> A flexible <b>edge</b> <b>seal</b> has been proposed to minimise the impact of these issues. In this paper, vacuum glazing system with rigid and flexible edge seals is theoretically studied and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum glazing {{is a form}} of low-conductance {{double glazing}} using in {{internal}} vacuum between the two glass sheets to eliminate heat transport by gas conduction and convection. An array of small support pillars separates the sheets; fused solder glass forms the <b>edge</b> <b>seal.</b> Heat transfer through the glazing occurs by radiation across the vacuum gap, conduction through the support pillars, and conduction through the bonded <b>edge</b> <b>seal.</b> Edge conduction is problematic because it affects stresses in the edge region, leading to possible failure of the glazing; in addition, excessive heat transfer because of thermal bridging in the edge region can lower overall window thermal performance and decrease resistance to condensation. Infrared thermography was used to analyze the thermal performance of prototype vacuum glazings, and, for comparison, atmospheric pressure superwindows. Research focused on mitigating the edge effects of vacuum glazings through the use of insulating trim, recessed edges, and framing materials. Experimentally validated finite-element and finite-difference modeling tools were used for thermal analysis of prototype vacuum glazing units and complete windows. Experimental measurements of edge conduction using infrared imaging were found to be in good agreement with finite-element modeling results for a given set of conditions. Finite-element modeling validates an analytic model developed for edge conduction...|$|E
