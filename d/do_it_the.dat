5|$|The poem {{opens with}} the {{marriage}} of king Volsung's daughter Signy to Siggeir, king of the Goths. The bridal feast is interrupted {{by the arrival of}} a stranger, the god Odin in disguise, who drives a sword into a tree-trunk. Though everyone tries to draw the sword, Volsung's son Sigmund is the only man who can <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> disappointed Siggeir takes his new wife home, inviting Volsung to visit him. When Volsung does so he is killed by Siggeir, and his sons are taken prisoner. While in captivity they are all killed by a wolf, apart from Sigmund who escapes into the forest. Signy sends Sigmund her two sons to help him in avenging their family, but Sigmund only accepts Sinfjotli, the hardier of the two. Sigmund and Sinfjotli kill Siggeir and burn down his hall, then return to their ancestral home, the hall of the Volsungs. Sigmund marries Borghild, while Sinfjotli goes abroad with Borghild's brother, quarrels with him, and kills him. On his return Sinfjotli is poisoned by Borghild, and she is turned out by Sigmund, who instead marries Hiordis. Sigmund is killed in battle, and the pregnant Hiordis is taken to live in the hall of King Elf in Denmark.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from his}} mother, Al Saher's family were never {{supportive}} of his direction {{in becoming a}} musician.

Saher's brother once took him to different places where people usually sang, and told him it's your choice to sing a respectful way or you can choose to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> bad way. He said {{that the only way to}} achieve success is if you respect your music and respect yourself.|$|E

25|$|Don and Roma reach Vardhaan and Jabbar. When {{ordered by}} Vardhaan and Jabbar - and even Don himself - Roma is shot by Jabbar when {{she refuses to}} kill Don. She still has {{feelings}} for Don, although he killed her brother five years earlier, and she also refused to kill him because she refused to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> illegal way. Don defeats Vardhaan and his thugs, and kills Jabbar. Don ultimately saves the entire team. Don obtains his immunity papers, surrendering the plates and a disc with information about his team. He brings Roma to a waiting ambulance, and they exchange glances before the doors close. Don later detonates a bomb planted earlier in Diwan's car.|$|E
25|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{replied that}} he would consent to the test since he was confident of Marie's guilt, but he felt {{there was no need}} to call on Orfila to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> president of the court ruled in favor of the prosecutor's suggestion. Therefore, in lieu of Orfila, two well-known apothecaries from Tulle, M. Dubois and his son, and a chemist from Limoges named Dupuytren, were assigned to conduct the tests. While they were performed, the trial proceeded at a snail's pace. When they finally entered the courtroom, everyone waited to see what they would say. The elder Dubois testified that despite using the Marsh test carefully, they failed to find any arsenic. Almost immediately, the courtroom was in an uproar as Marie felt vindicated.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the decoding stage a child will often be devoting so much mental capacity to the process of decoding that they will have no comprehension of the meaning of the words being read. This is most likely if the text being read is at or above their skill level. It is nevertheless an important stage. Such decoding practice allows the child to improve their decoding skills with the ultimate goal of becoming automatic as it is for most skilled readers with most text they encounter. Like every skill, the more you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> better you get. Though comprehension may be poor at this stage, it is nevertheless an important step towards comprehension. As the skill of decoding improves and the more automatic it becomes the more the child has mental capacity to devote to comprehension. Therefore, understanding of what is being read increases.|$|E
25|$|With two rival Irish {{armed forces}} {{now in the}} country, civil war looked likely from the spring of 1922. Three events set it off. The first was the {{election}} of 18 June 1922, which the pro-Treaty Sinn Féin party won, giving the Free State a popular mandate. The second was the assassination by Irish republicans in London of a retired British general Henry Hughes Wilson. While {{it is not clear}} who ordered the killing, the British government assumed it was the anti-Treaty IRA and ordered Collins to act against them or risk armed British intervention to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> third trigger was the kidnapping by the IRA in the Four Courts of Free State general, JJ O'Connell. This combination of events forced the Collins government to assault and take the anti-Treaty positions in Dublin, which it succeeded in doing after a week's fighting in July 1922. Éamon de Valera declared his support for the anti-Treaty IRA after the outbreak of hostilities.|$|E
25|$|The Third Test {{began at}} Chennai on 18 March with high {{expectations}} of a hard-fought series decider. Australia won the toss {{for the third time}} and elected to bat. Hayden batted through the first day for an eventual total of 203, but the rest of Australia's team contributed little to the total of 391. Again, Harbhajan Singh was the destroyer, taking 7–133. India pushed to 501 on the back of Tendulkar's 126. Australia ended day 4 at 241/7, a precarious lead of 131 runs. Early on day 5, Harbhajan again ran through the Australian tail, taking 8–84 and his series tally to an astounding 32 wickets, leaving Australia all out for 264. India had a target of 155 to chase, and plenty of time to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> only question was whether Australia's bowlers could get them out first. In 42 nail-biting overs, India steadily lost wickets, sinking to 135/7, a tantalising 20 runs short of victory, but in dire danger of losing their last batsmen before they could score them. The 8th wicket fell at 151, 4 runs short of victory, and it was left to wicket-keeper Sameer Dighe and Harbhajan Singh to see out the end. Harbhajan Singh scored the winning runs past point and sealed the game and an incredible comeback series victory for India. The series victory for India meant that Australia had still not won a series in India for over 30 years.|$|E

It 2 ̆ 7 s hard to tell whether 2 ̆ 2 Loose Change 2 ̆ 2 is a you 2 ̆ 7 ve-gotta-hear-this conspiracy theory or a tongue-firmly-in-cheek parody of a conspiracy theory. Maybe I 2 ̆ 7 m just jaded, but it seems to me—particularly after reading David Aaronovitch 2 ̆ 7 s excellent book Voodoo Histories: The Role of Conspiracy Theory in the Shaping of Modern History (Penguin, 2010) —that we 2 ̆ 7 ve heard all this before: Satan 2 ̆ 7 s children <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Freemasons <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Illuminati <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Jews <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> Commies <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Mafia <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> John Birch Society <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Trilateral Commission <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Bilderberg Group <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Club of Rome <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> Skull and Bones <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> PNAC <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> and everyone else has done 2 ̆ 2 it 2 ̆ 2 whatever 2 ̆ 2 it 2 ̆ 2 happens to be.

You 2 ̆ 7 d think we 2 ̆ 7 d have learned by now not to believe that 2 ̆ 2 dark, hidden forces 2 ̆ 2 are behind everything because, well, they demonstrably aren 2 ̆ 7 t. But people want to believe these things, particularly when they seem to explain why something distrubing—say, the collapse of Germany in WWI, the high costs of rapid industrialization in the USSR in the 1930 s, or America 2 ̆ 7 s evident lack of {{preparation for}} 9 / 11 —wasn 2 ̆ 7 t 2 ̆ 2 our 2 ̆ 2 fault, but rather someone else 2 ̆ 7 s. I would like to think that David 2 ̆ 7 s wonderful book will put an end to loopy conspiracy theories so that we can get on with the important business of fixing things that matter. It probably won 2 ̆ 7 t, but nonetheless Voodoo History is certainly a fine step in that direction and I applaud David for writing it (and you for reading it) ...|$|R
