25|$|Hinduism {{originated}} on the Indian subcontinent. It {{is considered}} {{by some to be}} the world's oldest extant religion. Hinduism contains a vast body of scripture, divided as revealed and remembered, expounding on dharma, or religious living. Hindus consider the Vedas and the Upanishads as being among the foremost in authority, importance and antiquity. The , a treatise <b>excerpted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> , is sometimes called a summary of the spiritual teachings of the Vedas. It is difficult to identify any universal belief or practice in Hinduism, although prominent themes include: Dharma, Samsara, Karma, and Moksha. Hinduism is sometimes called a polytheistic religion, but this is an oversimplification. Hinduism includes a diverse collection of schools whose beliefs span monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, monism and even atheism. For instance, the Advaita Vedanta school holds {{that there is only one}} causal entity (Brahman), which manifests itself into all the various living and non-living forms that we observe, whereas traditions such as Vaishnavism and Shaivism worship Vishnu and Shiva in a relatively more monotheistic sense (caused by a differentiation between the parabrahman and atman). A number of scholars even consider the Samkhya school of thought to have atheistic leanings.Weightman (1997). Pg 263.|$|E

500|$|The studio {{recordings}} {{featured on}} (Untitled) mostly consisted of newly written, self-penned material, including {{a number of}} songs that had been composed by McGuinn and Broadway theatre impresario Jacques Levy for a planned country rock musical titled Gene Tryp that the pair were developing. [...] Plans for the musical had fallen through and as a result, McGuinn decided to record some of the material originally intended for the production with the Byrds. [...] Among the Gene Tryp songs included on (Untitled) was [...] "Chestnut Mare", which had originally been written for {{a scene in which}} the musical's eponymous hero attempts to catch and tame a wild horse. [...] The song was <b>excerpted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> album and issued as a single in the U.S. on October 23, 1970, but it only managed to climb to number 121 on the Billboard chart. Nonetheless, the song {{went on to become a}} staple of FM radio programming in America during the 1970s. [...] "Chestnut Mare" [...] did much better in the UK, however, when it was released as a single on January 1, 1971, reaching number 19 on the UK Singles Chart and giving the Byrds their first UK Top 20 hit since their cover of Bob Dylan's [...] "All I Really Want to Do" [...] had peaked at number 4 in September 1965.|$|E
500|$|The Mandarin-language Gēnǚ hóng mǔdān ( [...] , Singsong Girl Red Peony), {{starring}} Butterfly Wu, premiered as China's {{first feature}} talkie in 1930. By February of that year, production was apparently completed on a sound version of The Devil's Playground, arguably qualifying {{it as the}} first Australian talking motion picture; however, the May press screening of Commonwealth Film Contest prizewinner Fellers is the first verifiable public exhibition of an Australian talkie. In September 1930, a song performed by Indian star Sulochana, <b>excerpted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> silent feature Madhuri (1928), was released as a synchronized-sound short, the country's first. The following year, Ardeshir Irani directed the first Indian talking feature, the Hindi-Urdu Alam Ara, and produced Kalidas, primarily in Tamil with some Telugu. Nineteen-thirty-one also saw the first Bengali-language film, Jamai Sasthi, and the first movie fully spoken in Telugu, Bhakta Prahlada. In 1932, Ayodhyecha Raja became the first movie in which Marathi was spoken to be released (though Sant Tukaram {{was the first to}} go through the official censorship process); the first Gujarati-language film, Narsimha Mehta, and all-Tamil talkie, Kalava, debuted as well. The next year, Ardeshir Irani produced the first Persian-language talkie, Dukhtar-e-loor. Also in 1933, the first Cantonese-language films were produced in Hong Kong—Sha zai dongfang (The Idiot's Wedding Night) and Liang xing (Conscience); within two years, the local film industry had fully converted to sound. Korea, where pyonsa (or byun-sa) held a role and status {{similar to that of the}} Japanese benshi, in 1935 became the last country with a significant film industry to produce its first talking picture: Chunhyangjeon (/) is based on the seventeenth-century pansori folktale [...] "Chunhyangga", of which as many as fifteen film versions have been made through 2009.|$|E

Even more significantly, in January 1910, Robert Kajanus, chief conductor of the Helsinki Orchestral Society, conducted Madetoja's Elegia (from the four-movement Symphonic Suite, Op. 4) to great success, with the Elegia described as the [...] "first master work" [...] of a budding [...] "natural orchestral composer". Upon graduation from both the Music Institute and the University of Helsinki in 1910, Madetoja {{began his career as}} a music writer and critic, penning essays and reviews for the Säveletär magazine and, later, the [...] Additional praise followed Madetoja's first composition concert in Helsinki on 26 September 1910, at which he conducted the Piano Trio and excerpts from the Symphonic Suite and the Chess Suite, Op. 5 (<b>excerpted</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> incidental music Madetoja had composed for Eino Leino's play). The positive reviews did, however, contain a note of concern; given Madetoja's plans to travel to Paris to resume his studies, one critic, [...] of Uusi Suometar, worried about how [...] "French modern atonal composition" [...] would negatively influence [...] "this fresh northern nature [...] ".|$|E
