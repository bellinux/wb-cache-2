5|$|Several design {{proposals}} were submitted, all calling for heavy main guns, between 30.5cm(12in) and 34.3cm(13.5in) calibers. However, financial limitations dictated that smaller, less expensive weaponry {{would be used}} instead. The final design therefore used the same 28cm(11in) double turret introduced <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> s— hydraulic elevated Drh LC/1907 instead of electrical elevated Drh LC/1906. In compensation, the design was given a relatively heavy secondary armament.|$|E

5|$|Game of Thrones has an {{ensemble}} cast {{estimated to be}} the largest on television; during its third season, 257 cast names were recorded. In 2014, several actor contracts were renegotiated to include a seventh-season option, with raises which reportedly made them among the highest-paid performers on cable TV. In 2016, it was reported that several actor contracts were again renegotiated, with five of the main cast members having increased their salary to £2 million per episode <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> seasons, which would make them the highest paid actors on television. The main cast is listed below.|$|E
5|$|Lacking an infield {{lighting}} system, {{cars were}} driven inside the stadium to illuminate it <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> {{events of the}} decathlon. The cycling tandem event, which {{was held in the}} dark, was another example of the main venue's lighting issues. After the Games it was used as the English national football stadium, hosting numerous concerts and sporting events, including the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final and the British leg of Live Aid in 1985. It was closed in 2000, and demolished three years later to allow the construction of the new Wembley Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{was still}} some way behind when Lindwall {{replaced}} Johnson. Fifteen runs later, Yardley bowled Loxton for 93, while Saggers only managed five {{in his first}} Test innings before being stumped after being lured out of his crease by Laker.
