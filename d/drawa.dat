2500|$|A jackpot {{ticket number}} is then drawn, {{separately}} from the main <b>draw.A</b> jackpot ticket can only {{be one of the}} previous tickets drawn which means you must be drawn twice to actually win a jackpot prize If the ticket number drawn matches a winning number exactly (one-offs do not count), then they win the jackpot; otherwise, that number wins 10 free tickets for an advance draw and the jackpot increments by a certain amount. In recent years the $2 Jackpot – which is statistically more difficult to win than the [...] "6-from-45" [...] Tattslotto-style games – has reached more than $10 million more than once through continued jackpotting. The highest jackpot win to date in the $2 Jackpot Lottery is $16,320,000, won on 6 October 2009. The highest jackpot win to date in the $5 Jackpot Lottery is $38.185 million won on 22 November 2011.|$|E
2500|$|In the two next centuries the Draa {{remains the}} object of fights between warring (nomadic) tribes. Unfortunately sources have paid too little {{attention}} to the sedentary population to give a complete picture of its history and evolution. The officers of the colonising French were almost exclusively interested in the neighbouring resisting warrior tribe of the Ait Atta and neglected the Ktawa of the Draa. It is probable, however, that during these last centuries the nomad tribes [...] in the Draa valley have integrated with the sedentary. Blood ties (real or imaginary) in which the determining factor whether one belonged to this or that tribe or sub-tribe make place for the determining factor of the qsour where one lives. Alliances are made between particular qsour and nomad groups which offer protection. At the end of the 18th century the power in the Ktawa is divided between three chiefs of three groups: the caid Mohamed in the qsour Beni Hayoun, cheik El Maati in the Beni Sbih and cheik Aamaou in {{the upper part of the}} valley. Around 1800 the security of these qsour was threatened by Arab nomads like the Ghenama and the Beni Mohammed and the protection of the Ait Atta was invoked. The price the sedentary groups paid for the protection was a part of their land. This method was custom at many places throughout the valley. Certain qsour however remained independent under the protection of their local chiefs or zawiyas (e.g. qsour Mezguita). Much of the history of the Draa valley is characterised by the warfare between different tribes and most of all by the crimes these tribes committed against the local <b>Drawa</b> population.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the park}} is located on Drawsk Plain, it does not {{necessarily}} mean that it is flat. There are picturesque and deep valleys of the <b>Drawa</b> and Plociczna rivers as well as numerous water channels, lakes and peat-bogs. In some places the height can vary by 30 meters within 500 meters. This is quite remarkable for a plain. The highest hill (106 m) is located near the Martew lake, in northern part of the Park.

(Z for Zmodernizowany - {{literally}} Modernized) Further {{development with}} SAGEM Savan-15 fire control system, according to life fire test Savan-15 has only minor advantage in accuracy over <b>Drawa.</b> The biggest advantage {{was a new}} gun stabilization system that gave the tank {{a significant increase in}} accuracy when the tank is on the move. Later it was used as a base to develop the PT-91M. This variant has won a number of stress tests in Malaysia over T-90, T-84 and K1 tanks, and has won the competition for a new Malaysian MBT.

50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 3rd century, the Dębczyn (Denzin) culture (or group) succeeded the Wielbark culture between the Persante and <b>Drawa</b> rivers, and a local, not yet {{classified}} culture between the lower Oder and Persante rivers. The adjacent areas to the east were uninhabited by this time. Whether the eastern Dębczyn culture replaced or evolved from the Wielbark culture is not yet known, in the western areas, settlement was continuous. The emergence of this group is characterized by an influence of the Vistula region (Wielbark culture), the expansion of the Gustow group, and many paralleles to the Elbe Germanic areas. The dead were buried unburned. The culture existed until the first quarter of the 6th century, when burial of the dead in grave fiedls stopped.|$|E
50|$|In 1537 {{the former}} Franciscan monk Faustinus Schliepe {{introduced}} Lutheranism to Dramburg during the Protestant Reformation. From 1540 {{the town was}} administered by the Order of St. John in Germany (until 1808). A great fire destroyed a wide section of Dramburg in 1620, leaving only five houses unscathed, while five years later numerous citizens died from plague. In 1638 during the Thirty Years' War, the Swedish colonel Beer plundered and pillaged Dramburg. Despite that setback, the town's economic advantages allowed it to recuperate quickly. Dramburg had staple rights, giving it the privilege to force merchants traveling on the <b>Drawa</b> to offer their wares, such as Kolberg salt, for sale at Dramburg's markets. Wool-weaving and shoe-making were also important craft industries since the Middle Ages.|$|E
50|$|Production variant for Polish Army, {{extensively}} modernized {{development of}} T-72M1. Most {{of the vehicles}} are equipped with SKO-1M Drawa-1T dual-axis stabilized fire control system (with TES - Thermal Elbow Sight - total number of delivered thermal sights is 202) though some early production vehicles have a SKO-1 <b>Drawa</b> (with NV sight), Erawa reactive armour, a PCO SSC-1 Obra-1 laser-warning system and 850 hp PZL-Wola S-12U engine. The first 20 initial production vehicles were delivered to Polish Land Forces in 1993-1994 with another 78 full-scale production vehicles delivered 1995-1997, 135 modernized T-72M1 tanks (made in late 80s) delivered 1998-2002. Both new and modernized tanks have the same combat capabilities. Depending exact configuration Polish Army uses PT-91s in 3 variants PT-91, PT-91M and PT-91MA1.|$|E
50|$|The {{modernization}} {{of the fire}} control system started by replacing the earlier used Soviet two plane stabilizer 2Є28M with a new stabilizer developed in Slovakia. It has an electronic information block showing the tank's technical condition. Furthermore, it informs the commander when effective sighted fire becomes ineffective because of an excessively high cross-country speed or other reasons.The <b>Drawa</b> fire control system, developed by Polish engineers, contains the gunner's day sight PCD and the TES thermovision night sight developed by the Israeli company El-Op, the commander's combined day-night passive observation and aiming sight POD-72, a ballistic computer, a laser rangefinder and a data system processing information for the ballistic computer. The sighting of the ballistic computer depends on the target's speed, weather conditions, projectile temperature and projectile type.|$|E
