40|$|Pressor {{effects of}} {{angiotensin}} I (AI) and angiotensin II (AII) {{on the human}} <b>foetoplacental</b> vasculature were compared in dual-perfused term placental cotyledons in which <b>foetoplacental</b> perfusion pressure was monitored. Arterial injections of 1 nmol doses of AI and AII caused marked increases in perfusion pressure; the mean pressor response to AI was 92. 9 +/- 5. 8 % (mean +/- s. e. mean) of the AII response. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril at 2. 2 microM reversibly reduced the AI response to 13. 7 +/- 3. 2 % (mean +/- s. e. mean) of the AII response, which was unaffected. Saralasin, an AII receptor blocker, at 94 nM reversibly antagonized both AI-and AII-induced increases in <b>foetoplacental</b> perfusion pressure. It is concluded that <b>foetoplacental</b> vasoconstriction elicited by AI is due to its conversion to AII by angiotensin-converting enzyme present in the <b>foetoplacental</b> bed...|$|E
40|$|AIM: In diabetes, {{perinatal}} morbidity {{is significantly}} increased. This may partly {{be related to}} functional changes in the <b>foetoplacental</b> vascular bed. In diabetes models, a defect in the cyclo-oxygenase pathway is a common observation. Therefore, we hypothesized that the human <b>foetoplacental</b> circulation of diabetic patients is characterized by dysfunction of the cyclo-oxygenase pathway, as well. METHODS: We performed ex-vivo perfusions of isolated placental cotyledons from healthy women (n = 14) and from patients with Type 1 diabetes (n = 9). The contribution of cyclo-oxygenase products to <b>foetoplacental</b> vascular tone was quantified by measuring {{the response to the}} cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. RESULTS: Baseline <b>foetoplacental</b> arterial pressure was comparable between controls and diabetic women (mean +/- sem, 21. 7 +/- 1. 2 vs. 24. 4 +/- 2. 0 mmHg). Maximum <b>foetoplacental</b> arterial pressure at highest dose of indomethacin was 32. 8 +/- 3. 0 mmHg in controls vs. 27. 3 +/- 2. 3 mmHg in diabetic women. The indomethacin-induced increase in pressure was reduced in diabetes (2. 9 +/- 0. 7 vs. 11. 2 +/- 2. 4 mmHg in controls, P = 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Under baseline conditions, the net effect of all cyclo-oxygenase products in the <b>foetoplacental</b> vascular bed is vasodilation. In diabetes, this vasodilator effect seems significantly impaired...|$|E
40|$|Pregnant women {{diagnosed}} with gestational diabetes mellitus subjected to diet (GDMd) {{that do not}} reach normal glycaemia are passed to insulin therapy (GDMi). GDMd associates with increased human cationic amino acid transporter 1 (hCAT- 1) -mediated transport of L-arginine and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity in <b>foetoplacental</b> vasculature, a phenomenon reversed by exogenous insulin. Whether insulin therapy results in reversal of the GDMd effect on the <b>foetoplacental</b> vasculature is unknown. We assayed whether insulin therapy normalizes GDMd-associated <b>foetoplacental</b> endothelial dysfunction. Primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from GDMi pregnancies were used to assay L-arginine transport kinetics, NOS activity, p 44 / 42 (mapk) and protein kinase B/Akt activation, and umbilical vein rings reactivity. HUVECs from GDMi or GDMd show increased hCAT- 1 expression and maximal transport capacity, NOS activity, and eNOS, and p 44 / 42 (mapk), but not Akt activator phosphorylation. Dilation in response to insulin or calcitonin-gene related peptide was impaired in umbilical vein rings from GDMi and GDMd pregnancies. Incubation of HUVECs in vitro with insulin (1 nmol/L) restored hCAT- 1 and eNOS expression and activity, and eNOS and p 44 / 42 (mapk) activator phosphorylation. Thus, maternal insulin therapy {{does not seem to}} reverse GDMd-associated alterations in human <b>foetoplacental</b> vasculature...|$|E
40|$|Whether {{differences}} in <b>foetoplacental</b> weight and post-implantation mortality in rodents are secondary to heterosis and inbreeding depression or antigenic differences {{between mother and}} foetus has been a continuing controversy. To determine whether non-specific depression or stimulation of the maternal immune system affects {{the success of the}} <b>foetoplacental</b> allograft, groups of virgin Fischer (Ag-B 1) females of similar age and weight mated with DA (Ag-B 4) males were treated with daily intraperitoneal injections of: (a) saline, (b) methylprednisolone (MP), 1 - 0 mg/kg, (c) cyclophosphamide (CY), 3. 0 mg/kg, or (d) azathioprine (AZ), 3. 0 mg/kg; or they were injected intraperitoneally on the fifth day of gestation with: (a) B. pertussis, 1. 0 ml, (b) C. parvum, 0. 2 ml, or (c) BCG, 0. 1 ml. None of the immunostimulating agents were detrimental to the progeny, but the immunosupprissive drugs caused an increased percentage of foetal deaths and <b>foetoplacental</b> growth retardation. The reduced foetal and placental size induced by CY or AZ could be partially blocked by simultaneous maternal treatment with BCG. Analysis of mean maternal weight gain, spleen weight assays, changes in the lymph nodes draining the uterus and comparison of data from non-pregnant animals and syngeneic pregnancies treated with these agents suggest that immunosuppressive drugs reduce foetal survival rates and produce <b>foetoplacental</b> growth retardation via a combination of immunological and cytotoxic mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) characterizes by <b>foetoplacental</b> endothelial dysfunction. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from women with GDM show increased L-arginine transport via the human cationic amino acid transporter 1 (hCAT- 1). Moreover, expression of endothelial {{nitric oxide synthase}} (eNOS) and nitric oxide synthesis are increased. Exosomes are increased in maternal plasma from GDM. We evaluated the role of <b>foetoplacental</b> endothelial exosomes on endothelial dysfunction in GDM. Exosomes were isolated from HUVECs from normal (ExN) and GDM (ExGDM) pregnancies. HUVECs were exposed (8 h) to ExN or ExGDM and used for wound recovery assay (up to 8 h), L-arginine transport, hCAT- 1 and eNOS expression and activity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and 44 and 42 kDa mitogen activated protein kinases (p 44 / 42 (mapk)) and protein kinase B/Akt (Akt) activation. Wound recovery was slower in GDM compared with normal pregnancies and was recovered by ExN. However, ExGDM delayed wound recovery in cells from normal pregnancies. GDM-increased L-arginine transport, hCAT- 1 and eNOS expression and activity, and p 44 / 42 (mapk) activation were blocked by ExN, but ExGDM increased these parameters and ROS generation, and reduced eNOS phosphorylation at threonine(495) in cells from normal pregnancies. Inhibition of p 44 / 42 (mapk), but not Akt reversed GDM-increased L-arginine uptake. In conclusion <b>foetoplacental</b> endothelial-released exosomes {{play a role in}} the maintenance of a GDM phenotype in HUVECs. It is suggested that ExN and ExGDM cargo are different with differential effects in cells from normal or GDM pregnancies. This phenomenon could contribute to the understanding of mechanisms behind <b>foetoplacental</b> endothelial dysfunction in GDM pregnancies...|$|E

Similar effects of <b>foetoplacental</b> removal are noted in pregnant mice. 3. Gonadotrophin induced lower activities of 20 alpha-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase, {{except at the}} very end of pregnancy, and partly inhibited the induction caused by <b>foetoplacental</b> removal. 4. The results suggest that existence of a placental factor that restrains these changes until the end of normal pregnancy, which is produced in amounts proportional to the number of placentae and is conveyed to the ovary via the blood. 5. This factor was not replaced by prolactin. 6. It is argued that neither placental lactogen nor pituitary luteotrophin participate in the induction of 20 alpha-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase at late pregnancy in the rat. 7.

40|$|Insulin {{resistance}} {{is characteristic of}} pregnancies where the mother shows metabolic alterations, such as preeclampsia (PE) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), or abnormal maternal conditions such as pregestational maternal obesity (PGMO). Insulin signalling includes activation of insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 (IRS 1 / 2) as well as Src homology 2 domain-containing transforming protein 1, leading to activation of 44 and 42 [*]kDa mitogen-activated protein kinases and protein kinase B/Akt (Akt) signalling cascades in the human <b>foetoplacental</b> vasculature. PE, GDM, and PGMO are abnormal conditions coursing with reduced insulin signalling, but {{the possibility of the}} involvement of similar cell signalling mechanisms is not addressed. This review aimed to determine whether reduced insulin signalling in PE, GDM, and PGMO shares a common mechanism in the human <b>foetoplacental</b> vasculature. Insulin resistance in these pathological conditions results from reduced Akt activation mainly due to inhibition of IRS 1 / 2, likely due to the increased activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) resulting from lower activity of adenosine monophosphate kinase. Thus, a defective signalling via Akt/mTOR in response to insulin is a central and common mechanism of insulin resistance in these diseases of pregnancy. In this review, we summarise the cell signalling mechanisms behind the insulin resistance state in PE, GDM, and PGMO focused in the Akt/mTOR signalling pathway in the human <b>foetoplacental</b> endothelium...|$|E

40|$|Intercellular {{communication}} {{is a critical}} process in biological mechanisms. During pregnancy <b>foetoplacental</b> tissues release a heterogeneous group of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that include exosomes, microvesicles, apoptotic bodies, and syncytial nuclear aggregates. These vesicles contain a complex cargo (proteins, DNA, mRNA transcripts, microRNAs, noncoding RNA, lipids, and other molecules) that actively participate in the maternal-foetal communication by modulating different processes during gestation for a successful foetal development. Each stage of human gestation is marked by events such as immunomodulation, proliferation, invasion, migration, and differentiation, among others, requiring EVs-mediated signalling to be nearby or distant target cells. Furthermore, EVs also associate with pregnancy pathologies such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction.

40|$|BACKGROUND Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) {{refers to}} {{any degree of}} glucose {{intolerance}} with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Maternal diabetes constitutes an unfavourable environment for embryonic and <b>foetoplacental</b> development. The histomorphological changes in the placenta are associated with increased perinatal morbidity, increased risk of diabetes in the offspring and the mother in the ensuing years of life. Present study aims to study the morphological changes in the placenta along with maternal and foetal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by GDM. MATERIALS AND METHODS A descriptive observational case-controlled study was conducted from January 2013 to November 2016 in King George Hospital, Visakhapatnam. Hundred and sixty four women diagnosed with GDM and hundred women with normal gestation {{were enrolled in the}} study. Foetal surveillance was done by Doppler ultrasound and kick count technique during the gestation. Foetal and maternal outcome was evaluated and compared to the outcome of normal gestation.

Statistical analysis was done using descriptive statistical measures. RESULTS In the present study, 62. 19...|$|E
40|$|Embryo {{implantation}} {{consists of}} a series of events promoting the invasion of the endometrium and then the uterine arterial system by the extra-embryonic trophoblast. In order for this semi-heterologous implantation to succeed, the endometrium has to first undergo a number of structural and biochemical changes (decidualization). The decidua's various constituents subsequently {{play a role in the}} embryonic implantation. The third step is the transformation of the uterine vascular system and the growth of the placenta, which will provide the <b>foetoplacental</b> unit with nutrients. Several physiopathological aspects will be discussed: 1) the implantation window, regulated by maternal and embryonic hormonal secretions and thus influenced by any defects in the latter: dysharmonic luteal phase, 21 -hydroxylase block, abnormal integrin expression, 2) the successive trophoblast invasions of uterine vessels which, when defective, lead to early embryo loss or late-onset vascular pathologies, as preeclampsia, 3) the pregnancy's immunological equilibrium, with a spontaneously tolerated semi-allogeneic implant, 4) the impact of pro-coagulant factors (thrombophilia) on the pregnancy's progression, 5) the environment of the uterus, ranging from hydrosalpinx to uterine contractions. In summary, the least anatomical or physiological perturbation can interfere with human embryonic implantation - a very particular phenomenon and a true biological paradox...|$|E

Prenatal diagnosis of velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord is of practical importance since unsupported vessels in the amnion may be lacerated {{at the time of}} membrane rupture. Failure to diagnose ruptured vessels can lead to fetal death. This mode of insertion occurs much more frequently with multi-foetal pregnancies. We present a case of 32 yrs old women who presented with amennorrhoea for 8 months. With history of previous first trimester abortion, she was found to be of 34 weeks gestational age, clinically.

We hypothesized that exposure to AFB 1 contaminated food during pregnancy could disrupt the normal production of steroid hormones in placenta. We examined the capability of AFB 1 exposure to disrupt CYP 19 A 1 expression as a putative endocrine disrupter, and to investigate the metabolism of AFB 1 by CYP 19 A 1. JEG- 3 cells, as model for placental cells, were exposed alone and in combination to AFB 1 and estrogen receptor ligands for 24 - 96. h. AFB 1 (0. 3 - 1. 0 μM) induced the expression of CYP 19 A 1 by 163 %- 339 % compared to control at the 96. h time point, although no induction was observed at 24. h. AFB 1 concentrations higher than 1 μM were cytotoxic to JEG- 3 cells, and the cytotoxicity was inhibited by the aromatase inhibitor, finrozole. AFB 1 was metabolized to aflatoxicol (AFL) by JEG- 3 cells and CYP 19 A 1 recombinant protein. AFL formation was partially inhibited by addition of tamoxifen and finrozole to the JEG- 3 cells. AFB 1 had no effect on the expression of CYP 1 A 2 and CYP 3 A 4 in JEG- 3 cells.

40|$|Adenosine is an {{endogenous}} nucleoside with pleiotropic {{effects in}} different physiological processes including circulation, renal blood flow, immune function, or glucose homeostasis. Changes in adenosine membrane transporters, adenosine receptors, and corresponding intracellular signalling network associate with development of pathologies of pregnancy, including preeclampsia. Preeclampsia {{is a cause}} of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality affecting 3 – 5 % of pregnancies. Since the proposed mechanisms of preeclampsia development include adenosine-dependent biological effects, adenosine membrane transporters and receptors, and the associated signalling mechanisms might {{play a role in}} the pathophysiology of preeclampsia. Preeclampsia associates with increased adenosine concentration in the maternal blood and placental tissue, likely due to local hypoxia and ischemia (although not directly demonstrated), microthrombosis, increased catecholamine release, and platelet activation. In addition, abnormal expression and function of equilibrative nucleoside transporters is described in <b>foetoplacental</b> tissues from preeclampsia; however, the role of adenosine receptors in the aetiology of this disease is not well understood. Adenosine receptors activation may be related to abnormal trophoblast invasion, angiogenesis, and ischemia/reperfusion mechanisms in the placenta from preeclampsia. These mechanisms may explain only a low fraction of the associated abnormal transformation of spiral arteries in preeclampsia, triggering cellular stress and inflammatory mediators release from the placenta to the maternal circulation. Although increased adenosine concentration in preeclampsia may be a compensatory or adaptive mechanism favouring placental angiogenesis, a poor angiogenic state is found in preeclampsia. Thus, preeclampsia-associated complications might affect the cell response to adenosine due to altered expression and activity of adenosine receptors, membrane transporters, or cell signalling mechanisms.

We present this rare {{congenital}} malformation complex highlighting {{the importance of}} early sonographic imaging findings in LBWC along with differentiation from other anterior abdominal wall defects. Limb body wall complex / Body stalk anomaly refers to a rare complicated polymalformative fetal malformation syndrome of uncertain etiology and results in head, heart, lung, diaphragm, kidney or gonadal abnormalities. LBWC was first described by Van Allen et al; in (1987). The {{two of the three}} following anomalies must be present to establish the diagnosis: 1. Exencephaly / Encephalocele with facial clefts, 2. Thoraco-Abdominoschisis / ventral body wall defects and 3. Limb defects. LBWC arises as a result of early amnion disruptions or error in embryonic development. If all components of the syndrome are present, the condition is lethal. LBWC is invariably fatal and incompatible with life. No case of postnatal survival is reported so far.

40|$|Glucose {{metabolism}} was {{studied in}} fed, starved and toxaemic ewes {{in the last}} month of gestation to ascertain causes of hypoglycaemia, and to determine whether the glucose metabolism of sheep susceptible to ovine pregnancy toxaemia (OPT) differs from those not susceptible. Glucose kinetics were measured with a single injection of [U- ¹⁴C], [6 -³H] glucose. Subsequently glucose tolerance tests were performed using 0. 4 g glucose/kg liveweight. Ewes were starved for 10 days to induce OPT, and blood samples were taken from one jugular vein and analysed for packed cell volume, glucose, ketones, free fatty acids, urea, creatinine, inorganic phosphate, total CO₂, total plasma protein and albumin. Glucose turnover was measured by a primed continuous infusion of [U -¹⁴C], [6 -³H] glucose when the ewe s became recumbent with OPT (and these were classified as susceptible, S) otherwise at the end of 10 days (and these were classified as non-susceptible, NS). The ewe was slaughtered {{at the end of the}} infusion. The caudate lobe of the maternal liver was removed, and perfused with collagenase to prepare hepatocytes for measuring the gluconeogenic potential of the liver. In another experiment, the effect of live foetuses on maternal glucose metabolism was assessed. Nooses were surgically implanted around the umbilical cords of foetuses in twin-pregnant ewes {{in the last month}} of gestation. Ten days after surgery, the ewes were starved for four days. Glucose turnover was measured by continuous infusion of [U-¹⁴C], [6 -³H] glucose and then the foetuses were killed by tightening the nooses. Blood samples were taken for 24 hours, to monitor glucose and acetoacetate concentrations. The ewe was then given a second infusion of tracer glucose, and subsequently killed for hepatocyte studies. A 5 -compartment model was proposed for glucose kinetics of fed, twin-pregnant ewes. Data of Sand NS ewes were compared by fitting to the model separately, using the SAAM program. Ewes susceptible to OPT had significantly higher insulin resistance (2043 µU/ml. min) than NS ewes (1261 µU/ml. min). This criterion could be useful in screening sheep for susceptibility before inducing the disease, and also provides evidence that OPT may be related to a poor ability to maintain glucose homeostasis. During starvation plasma glucose decreased, while ketones and free fatty acids increased. The final concentrations were related to the state of the lambs rather than OPT symptoms. Indications of renal failure (raised serum creatinine, urea and inorganic phosphate, and lowered total CO₂) were observed in both S and NS ewes. On post-mortem analysis, liver glycogen of S ewes was 10 % (2 mg/g) the level of NS ewes (18 mg/g). The gluconeogenic potential of hepatocytes from S ewes, with the substrates propionate, lactate, alanine, glutamine and glycerol, was significantly lower than that of NS ewes and the rates were not stimulated by glucagon. It is hypothesized that the development of OPT may be related to a lesion in glucose production. Ewes with dead lambs were often hyperglycaemic (plasma glucose greater than 80 mg/dl) had significantly higher glucose turnover rates (6. 90 g/kg/day) than those with live lambs (2. 67 g/kg/day), and had significantly higher gluconeogenic potentials, measured on hepatocytes. This suggested that the maternal glucose production was restricted by the presence of live foetuses. Killing the foetuses in utero raised plasma glucose (from 27 to 99 mg/dl), increased glucose turnover (from 2. 39 to 4. 82 g/kg/day) and significantly increased hepatocyte glucose production. It is hypothesized that the hypoglycaemia of starved pregnant ewes is due to inhibition of hepatic glucose production by some <b>foetoplacental</b> factor...|$|E
40|$|Recurrent {{abortion}} of non-infectious or non-organic origin {{is exceedingly}} prevalent in many species including man, yet virtually no information on possible metabolic and endocrine causes was available. In order {{to study the}} pathogenesis of this form of gestational failure, an experimental flock was constituted which consisted of normal and habitually aborting Angora goats, a species in which {{the high incidence of}} abortion constitutes a significant economic problem. The investigation was initially {{complicated by the fact that}} at the time of its inception there were no acceptable theories regarding the cause of the initiation of normal parturition. For this reason experimental work on relevant fundamental aspects was included in the study. Comparative studies on normal and aborting goats entailed: (i) Investigations of sexual behavioural patterns and of breeding performance in mature animals, followed by physiological, clinical and pathological observations on mature does, foetuses and kids. (ii) Development of suitable methods for the precise chemical assay of steroid hormone metabolism in goats. The methods used facilitated detailed studies on luteal function, cortisol metabolism and the excretion of oestrogens. (iii) Investigation of the mohair growth rate as well as its fibre characteristics in relation to reproductive capabilities. (iv) Experimental reproduction in normal animals of the aberrations found and the investigation of the significance of such aberrations in causing gestation termination. Gestational failure was more prevalent in the heavier, older type of goats which were found to have enlarged pituitaries and which occasionally exhibited clinical signs of disturbed adrenal function. Animals that had aborted exhibited abnormally short oestrous cycles which appeared to be responsible for a lowered conception rate. Their ovaries contained cystic corpora lutea and displayed excessive follicular growth; experimental studies indicated that these changes were secondary to adrenal hyperplasia. Abortions were most frequent during the early part of the fourth month of gestation, a time which coincided with the most rapid increase in the rate of foetal growth and also with the cessation of placental growth. The condition of the foetus destined to be aborted suggested placental insufficiency; growth was retarded, anaemia was usually present and the concentration of some elements in the liver was abnormally low. Changes noted prior to abortion included excessive or deficient urinary oestrogen excretion, excessive ovarian follicular growth, the sudden onset of maternal adrenal atrophy, accumulation of excessive foetal fluids and degeneration of the placentomes. Control of gestation maintenance by the corpus luteum was confirmed; removal of the corpus luteum from Angora goats at any stage of pregnancy resulted in abortion 40 to 60 hours later. Variations in the level of luteal function during gestation are postulated to be due to a placental lactogen-type hormone secreted by the growing placenta. Peripheral plasma levels of progesterone tended to be higher than usual in pregnant aborters, but were depressed shortly prior to abortion in only some individuals. Studies on ovarian secretion rates suggested that this reduction was partly due to a lowered adrenal contribution, which may be expected in view of an observed concurrent adrenal atrophy. Signs of impending abortion were, however, evident while luteal function was still quite normal. The markedly aberrant oestrogen excretion rate of aborters could only be ascribed to an abnormal supply of steroid precursors resulting from altered metabolism in the maternal adrenal glands. Newborn kids destined to perpetuate the abortion defect tended to be heavier than normal and had finer birthcoats. The quantity of mohair produced by the young animal born from aborter stock was exceptional and the young males produced 30 per cent more than usual. Adrenal function in young high-producing aborter stock was lower than usual. However, established regular aborters had enlarged adrenal cortices and produced smaller quantities of finer mohair. Such findings are consistent with experimental results obtained with other species, the results demonstrating that corticosteroids inhibit the rate of hair growth and the fibre diameter. Evidence is presented which suggests that the adrenal enlargement found in aborters is an adaptive response favouring the foetus at the expense of hair production characteristics; aborter does which could maintain a higher level of adrenal function throughout gestation carried their foetuses successfully to term. Experimental administration of small doses of corticosteroids to goats during pregnancy prolonged gestation by several days, a situation which resembled successfully adapted aborter does. Dose-related prolongation of gestation was also obtained when small amounts of corticosteroid were administered to the sheep or goat foetus, but slightly higher dosages lead to rapid expulsion of the foetus. When administered maternally to sheep, these steroids caused a moderate reduction of placental progesterone synthesis. However, the same dosage rate given to the foetus caused a more drastic progesterone block, rapidly followed by expulsion of the foetus. Adrenalectomy of the foetus caused indefinite prolongation of gestation in sheep, but not in goats. The investigations have contributed to the concept that normal birth is initiated by the foetal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis; when the hypothalamus is adequately sensitive to ensure viability of the foetus, it responds to the usual prenatal deterioration of the foetal nutritional environment by stimulating the foetal adrenal glands and the elevated steroid secretions have effects on the <b>foetoplacental</b> unit, resulting in the initiation of parturition, possibly by means of blocking both the production and the action of progesterone. The cause of abortion in Angora goats appears to be intimately related to a high metabolic priority for hair growth, artificially induced by intensive selection and inbreeding. An abnormally low level of adrenal function, coupled with some qualitative changes in adrenal steroid biosynthesis seems to be the responsible mechanism. Physiological adaptation involves adrenal hyperplasia in order to assist the transfer of maternal nutrients to the foetus. Abortion is a consequence of the failure of this mechanism.
