40|$|The Department of Radiology at St. Luke’s Hospital has {{provided}} a screening service for stroke related disease since April 1991. This consisted of Duplex Ultrasound screening (DUS) for Extracranial Carotid Artery Disease (ECAD) followed by angiography or intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (lADSA) or <b>digital</b> <b>intravenous</b> <b>angiography</b> (DIVA) if ultrasound screening was positive for significant disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate in the local context, the various criteria for assessment already established overseas and to devise the best combination of these criteria to improve the detection of disease, thus improving the quality of the•local screening service. 504 patients have been screened for stroke related disease. Twelve patients (6 M : 6 F) with significant disease, who were considered for surgery, were referred for angiography, IADSA or DIVA. Comparison of these two modalities, DUS and vascular study, were made on 22 sides for the Multicentre Criteria (MCC), the Modified Seattle Criteria (MSC) and the Modified Washington Criteria (MWC). The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated for the MCC, the MSC and the MWC for peak systolic velocity. For the MCC the end diastolic velocity, the systolic velocity ratio and the diastolic velocity ratio were also compiled. The highest precision for extra cranial carotid artery disease screening can be achieved by a combination of the MCC or MSC for peak systolic velocity and with the systolic velocity ratio for the MCC...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA case of true pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA) {{aneurysm}} is reported. A calcified lesion {{was initially}} detected by plain x-ray films, and an essential diagnosis was made before operation by <b>intravenous</b> <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> (IVDSA).

Additionally, we reviewed {{a total of}} 82 cases with PDA aneurysm out of the 88 cases that had {{been reported in the}} English-language literature up to 1993. Fifty-three cases were accompanied by aneurysmal rupture (rupture group), and 29, including our case, were without rupture (nonrupture group). Because of the high mortality rate (49. 1 %) in the rupture group, a precise diagnosis and adequate treatment of PDA aneurysm before rupture is important. In the nonrupture group, a calcification on radiography appeared in 61. 6 % of the cases in which aneurysms were not found incidentally; this seems to be a significant indication for <b>angiography.</b> Moreover, <b>intravenous</b> <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> is quite useful for the screening of PDA aneurysm because it is an easy and noninvasive examination.

40|$|Duplex {{sonography}} and <b>intravenous</b> <b>digital</b> subtraction <b>angiography</b> (DSA) {{were compared}} in 102 carotid bifurcations in 51 patients. Sonograms were adequate in 87 (85 %) vessels and angiograms were adequate {{on at least}} one view in 86 (84 %) vessels.

Although most vessels were seen well on one view only on DSA, agreement with sonography was exact in 73 % of compared vessels and acceptable in 96 %. Furthermore, no difference was found in the rate of agreement with sonography for vessels seen well by DSA on two or more views compared with those seen well on one view only. It was concluded that DSA and sonography are comparable screening methods for carotid disease and that a suboptimal study by either can usually be compensated for by performance of the other.

Position of the external carotid artery anterolateral to the internal carotid artery was noted in 26 / 200 (13 %) bifurcations, but this anatomical variant was more common on the right (21 / 100) than on the left (5 / 100) (p less than 0. 01). Practical implications may be drawn from this study.

Computer-based digital subtraction techniques now permit high contrast left ventriculography after intravenous administration of contrast medium. To compare the accuracy of <b>intravenous</b> <b>digital</b> subtraction left ventriculography with film-based, standard contrast ventriculography, we assessed left ventricular function by both methods in 32 patients (8 with valvular disease, 22 with coronary disease and 2 with atypical pain). Studies in 31 of 32 patients were considered. Left ventricular ejection fraction by standard contrast ventriculography ranged from 24 to 88 %. Digital subtraction angiography was performed with bolus injection of radiopaque contrast material (30 cc at 20 cc/s) into the inferior vena cava. The two methods correlated closely in end-diastolic volume (correlation coefficient [r] = 0. 96, probability [p] < 0. 001), end-systolic volume (r = 0. 97, p < 0. 001) and ejection fraction (r = 0. 98, p < 0. 001).

Compared to the standard practice this method simply consists of a manual injection of a standard ionic contrast medium via an antecubital vein punctured with a large catheter needle (caliber 14 G), without preparatory injection of an intestinal antispasmodic. This method has produced a satisfactory arterial opacification in 96 % of the cases. The advantages and disadvantages of the technique are discussed. Of the 262 remaining patients, 250 were also examined by the peripheral venous mode, but the technique had to be modified in at least one of its aspects for one reason or another. Only 12 patients were not examined by the peripheral venous mode (7 puncture failures, 4 permanent venous accesses already installed). The IVDA simplified technique appears to be reliable for detecting reno-vascular arterial hypertension and with certain limitations, for the control of kidney grafts.

Our purpose was to evaluate the long-term patency in elastase-induced saccular aneurysm models in rabbits. METHODS: Serial <b>intravenous</b> <b>digital</b> subtractive <b>angiography</b> (IVDSA) was performed in 20 elastase-induced saccular aneurysm models in rabbits 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months after creation.

40|$|Exercise left {{ventriculography}} {{has been}} shown to be a sensitive and specific tool for the detection of coronary artery disease. At the present time, such studies require radionuclide-based methods. Computer-based techniques recently have been shown to provide high resolution images of the left ventricle when the levophase of an intravenous injection of radiopaque contrast medium is imaged with fluoroscopy. To evaluate the possible efficacy of using “intravenous digital subtraction left ventriculograms” in exercise ventriculography, such ventriculograms were performed at rest and during maximal supine bicycle exercise in 31 patients. Studies that could be analyzed were obtained in 29 patients. In 21 patients with coronary artery disease, ejection fraction was 58 % at rest and 45 % with exercise (p < 0. 001 vs. rest). In contrast, in seven patients with no coronary artery disease, ejection fraction was 65 % at rest and 69 % with exercise (difference not significant). In a subgroup of 8 patients with “severe” coronary obstruction, the change in ejection fraction from rest to exercise was - 18 %, while in the remaining 13 patients with less severe disease, it was - 9 % (p < 0. 001). All patients with coronary artery disease manifested new or worsening segmental wall abnormality with exercise, compared with two of seven patients without coronary disease (p < 0. 01).

Image processing includes beam harmonic contamination correction, spatial deconvolution and the extraction of a 'contrast' and a 'tissue' image from each couple of radiograms simultaneously acquired at energies bracketing the K-edge of iodine. Quantitative analysis includes the estimation of the vessel diameter, the calculation of the absolute iodine concentration profiles along the coronary arteries and the stenosis degree measurement...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Digital {{subtraction}} angiography (DSA) is {{a valuable}} tool in the investigation and treatment of patients with cerebrovascular disorders. In this paper, {{the experience of the}} Cleveland Clinic with intravenous DSA (more than 5, 000 studies) and intra-arterial (IA) DSA is reviewed. Stroke Vol 13, No 5. 1982 THE INTRAVENOUS INJECTION of contrast medi um for the visualization of vascular structures was introduced 43 years ago by Robb and Steinberg. 1 This technique never gained widespread popularity because of the technical problems in obtaining consistent im ages of good quality. Also, the amount of contrast medium that had to be injected to achieve adequate visualization of large arteries was substantial and tim ing of the circulation was difficult. The advent of computer technology has permitted a reassessment of the role of <b>intravenous</b> <b>angiography</b> in the evaluation of cerebrovascular disease. Important contributions to the development of this technique have been made by groups at the University of Wi...|$|R
40|$|Importance: Optical {{coherence}} tomography angiography (OCTA) allows {{visualization of}} iris racemose hemangioma course {{and its relation}} to the normal iris microvasculature. Objective: To describe OCTA features of iris racemose hemangioma. Design, Setting, and Participants: Descriptive, noncomparative case series at a tertiary referral center (Ocular Oncology Service of Wills Eye Hospital). Patients diagnosed with unilateral iris racemose hemangioma were included in the study. Main Outcomes and Measures: Features of iris racemose hemangioma on OCTA. Results: Four eyes of 4 patients with unilateral iris racemose hemangioma were included in the study. Mean patient age was 50 years, all patients were white, and Snellen visual acuity was 20 / 20 in each case. All eyes had sectoral iris racemose hemangioma without associated iris or ciliary body solid tumor on clinical examination and ultrasound biomicroscopy. By anterior segment OCT, the racemose hemangioma was partially visualized in all cases. By OCTA, the hemangioma was clearly visualized as a uniform large-caliber vascular tortuous loop with intense flow characteristics superimposed over small-caliber radial iris vessels against a background of low-signal iris stroma. The vascular course on OCTA resembled a light bulb filament (filament sign), arising from the peripheral iris (base of light bulb) and forming a tortuous loop on reaching its peak (midfilament) near the pupil (n[*]=[*] 3) or midzonal iris (n[*]=[*] 1), before returning to the peripheral iris (base of light bulb). <b>Intravenous</b> fluorescein <b>angiography</b> performed in 1 eye depicted the iris hemangioma; however, small-caliber radial iris vessels were more distinct on OCTA than <b>intravenous</b> fluorescein <b>angiography.</b> Conclusions and Relevance: Optical coherence tomography angiography is a noninvasive vascular imaging modality that clearly depicts the looping course of iris racemose hemangioma. Optical coherence tomography angiography depicted fine details of radial iris vessels, not distinct on <b>intravenous</b> fluorescein <b>angiography...</b>|$|R
