60|$|The maid <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} {{and went on}} preparing her mistress's clothes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Verloc <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. Chief Inspector Heat {{was amazed}} at her coolness.|$|E
60|$|Whispering Winds <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} with a startled cry, {{which ended in}} a scream.|$|E
6000|$|... "But--what," [...] {{she went}} on hurriedly, still <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} as if she suspected some trick--"what has brought you to this?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{girls were}} just walking past this lot when Helen {{happened}} to <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder {{and set up}} a cry of alarm.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{name is not}} Burnside," [...] Margaret went on, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} {{across the}} gardens and toward the river; [...] "my name is--" ...|$|R
60|$|The piano {{stopped as}} he entered, {{and the girl}} on the music-stool <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|Kate <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> table, with a perplexed {{look upon}} her countenance, and said, [...] "I don't {{believe there is}} {{anything}} to cook." ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} and saw Hoopdriver. [...] "Damn!" [...] {{said the other}} man in brown, quite audibly, starting as he followed her glance.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Biddy, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} again, [...] "he {{never told}} me so; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought so. Lynde {{said she}} had seen you on the shore once. Well"--she cast an {{uncertain}} <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder at the house--"I'm much obliged to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{get worse}} and worse. Sir Jasper, do vary the horrors by {{a touch of}} fun, or I shall run away," [...] said Blanche, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} nervously.|$|R
60|$|Jean {{laughed and}} went on; {{but her eyes}} gleamed with sudden malice, and she <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} with an expression which boded ill for the faithful old servant.|$|E
60|$|The {{outhouse}} {{lay in the}} neighbourhood of the hives, a gaunt, wooden structure {{surrounded by}} bushes. Elizabeth <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder as she drew the key from her pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... “To go {{down the}} river with me.” Subienkow <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> critically. “She will make a good wife, {{and it is an}} honour worthy of my {{medicine}} to be married to your blood.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{a terrible}} {{old man of}} yours, Reginald," [...] the former observed, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. [...] "I never came across such a person off the boards at Drury Lane." ...|$|R
60|$|Thuvia of Ptarth, {{battling for}} more than life against the lust of Jav, cast a quick <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} toward the forest from which had rumbled the fierce growl. Jav looked, too.|$|R
6000|$|EILEEN (puzzled). I can't {{understand}} how anyone could---- (With a worried <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.) I think I'd better look for Miss Gilpin, hadn't I? She may wonder---- (She half rises from her chair.) ...|$|R
60|$|Manuel kindled at once, and Pauline smiled stealthily as she <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} {{from the}} threshold of the dancing hall, for her slightest act, look, and word had their part to play in that night's drama.|$|E
60|$|The appalled Frances shrank {{back from}} between {{her brother and}} lover, where her ardent {{feelings}} had carried her, as the whole truth <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> mind, and she sank into a seat, gazing wildly on the young men.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep {{near the}} shore. It isn't {{safe in the}} middle." [...] Jo heard, but Amy was {{struggling}} {{to her feet and}} did not catch a word. Jo <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aren't you tired?" [...] she asked, <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} and turning towards {{him a little}} pink ear, a fluffy golden curl, and one blue eye twinkling from the very corner of its lid.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cap'n Kittridge!" [...] {{said his}} helpmeet, drawing herself up, and giving him an austere <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> spectacles; [...] "how often must I {{tell you that}} there is {{subjects}} which shouldn't be treated with levity?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{stop at the}} tannery when I {{come back}} from Brampton," [...] she said, and drove on. Once she gave a {{fleeting}} <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, {{and he was still}} standing where she had left him.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Jo <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, {{but no one}} was in sight; {{and rather}} liking the joke of the thing, she laughed back, saying, [...] "Well, if you won't mention it, I think I will;" [...] and with two nimble steps was in the willow.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{we were at}} the piano, and Beatrice {{was playing}} with noisy inaccuracy. She <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} and Lady Osprey had resumed her patience. The old lady was very pink, and appeared to be absorbed in some attempt to cheat herself without our observing it.|$|E
60|$|I <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder. She was {{perfectly}} right. It {{was a man}} beyond all doubt, the figure on the wagon. Yet the hand was Aunt Emma's, every line and every stroke of it; except, of course, the scars. Those, I saw at a glance, were wholly wanting.|$|E
60|$|The sound {{made by the}} saw was so slight that it did {{not worry}} her, but another sound, of an entirely {{different}} character and coming from the hallway, caused her to pause and <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Arrayed in her Sunday {{best she}} left the house half an hour later. A <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} revealed her husband huddled up in {{a chair in the}} dirty kitchen, gazing straight before him at the empty grate.|$|R
60|$|Blank silence ensued. Ellen cast a slow <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{father and}} the others, then she began to loosen the cinches of her saddle. Presently Jorth burst the silence with a curse, and Daggs {{followed}} {{with one of his}} sardonic laughs.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Snowdon {{remained}} {{silent for a}} moment, with brows knit in deep thought, while Annon uneasily watched her. Suddenly she <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, drew nearer, and whispered cautiously, [...] "Did the rumors of which you speak charge him with--" [...] and the last word was breathed into Annon's ear almost inaudibily.|$|E
60|$|She <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} {{and found him}} nearer than she thought, started, gesticulated, gave a little cry that pierced me to the heart, and fled up the beach obliquely toward me, running like the wind, and passed me, vanished amidst the black distorted bushes, and was gone--she and her pursuer, in a moment, over the ridge of sand.|$|E
60|$|The pause lengthened. She <b>glanced</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} {{down the}} vacant avenue. This interview--this momentous series of things unsaid {{was coming to}} an end! She looked at him hesitatingly and smiled again. She held out her hand. No doubt that was the proper thing to do. He took it, searching a void, tumultuous mind in vain.|$|E
60|$|Nat did neither, {{but still}} leaned {{in the doorway}} and still watched the trim figure before him, as if it was very {{pleasant}} to his eyes; while Ruth, after a brief <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, a nod and a smile, spatted away as busily as ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear," [...] {{she replied}} in a cold, small voice, [...] "so {{you are still}} {{worrying}} about that. I--I envied you." [...] With a <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, she leaned closer. [...] "Next time you go," [...] she breathed out to me, [...] "we'll go together." ...|$|R
6000|$|But {{after walking}} {{a few blocks}} she saw a sign, [...] "Cashier wanted," [...] {{in the window of}} a {{confectionery}} store. In she went and applied for the place, after casting a quick <b>glance</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder to assure herself that the job-preventer was not on her trail.|$|R
