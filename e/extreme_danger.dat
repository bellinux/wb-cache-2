25|$|The George Cross {{was instituted}} by King George VI, on 24 September 1940, {{replacing}} the Empire Gallantry Medal. It is the civilian {{equivalent to the}} Victoria Cross.

This medal is awarded only for acts of the greatest heroism or the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of <b>extreme</b> <b>danger.</b>|$|E

No lives were lost in Caruthersville as a result. More than half the community was destroyed. Charitable outpouring was enormous and several key buildings, including one of the schools, have been rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|Rusk's {{mountaineering}} career {{took him}} all over the West Coast of the United States, beginning in 1889 and continuing to 1930. He met many other people on his many journeys; however, few people became close friends and learned about his personal life. The few who knew him described {{him as one of}} the most expert and daring mountaineers in the West. While Rusk had some close calls and got himself into some hair raising situations, he had very few accidents while climbing and often saved others from <b>extreme</b> <b>danger.</b> He was not braggadocious about his exploits and in fact would only give the most matter-of-fact answers about them. He was known to be tenacious in his exploits, yet tempered by his good sense and consideration for others with him. Rusk was most familiar with Mount Adams, climbing it many times and exploring the area around it extensively.|$|E

25|$|This type {{of action}} was typical all along D Company's assault line and every time the Australians {{received}} fire from a building, tank rounds were used to breach the walls and a small team of infantry would conduct room clearance until all resistance was quelled. During the fighting some of the VC had discarded their uniforms and weapons and attempted to mingle with the pockets of civilians that were unable to escape. The continued presence of civilians in the village required the Australians to expose themselves to <b>extreme</b> <b>danger</b> while trying to usher these groups {{to the rear of}} the battle zone. Others tried to flee the village, or hide in the small air raid bunkers attached to every house. The fighting continued all afternoon and only ended at last light. With Binh Ba still insecure, D Company and their armoured support subsequently occupied a defensive harbour for the night, exhausted by the fighting. Overnight B Company killed two VC trying to break out to the south.|$|E
25|$|One such {{therapy is}} trauma-focused therapy. This therapy {{involves}} bringing {{the most disturbing}} elements of a traumatic memory to mind and using therapist-guided cognitive restructuring {{to change the way}} the memories are thought about. The change in evaluation usually involves highlighting that the feelings of certain death, <b>extreme</b> <b>danger,</b> hopelessness and helplessness within a traumatic memory do not apply to the person now, as they survived the event. The therapy also focuses on extending the memory so it is recalled beyond the most traumatic parts. Extending them to a point where the person felt safe again, so they remember the event in a more complete way with less focus on the negative aspects. As an example, a traumatic memory of wartime combat might be extended to after a battle, to when the person was no longer in immediate danger. In processing the memory in these ways it becomes less likely to intrude into their thoughts as an unwanted flashback.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}}. Lt. Col. Jackson distinguished himself as pilot of a C-123 aircraft. Lt. Col. Jackson volunteered to attempt the rescue of a 3-man USAF Combat Control Team from the Special Forces camp at Kham Duc. Hostile forces had overrun the forward outpost and established gun positions on the airstrip. They were raking the camp with small arms, mortars, light and heavy automatic weapons, and recoilless rifle fire. The camp was engulfed in flames and ammunition dumps were continuously exploding and littering the runway with debris. In addition, eight aircraft had been destroyed by the intense enemy fire and one aircraft remained on the runway reducing its usable length to only 2,200 feet. To further complicate the landing, the weather was deteriorating rapidly, thereby permitting only one air strike prior to his landing. Although fully aware of the <b>extreme</b> <b>danger</b> and likely failure of such an attempt. Lt. Col. Jackson elected to land his aircraft and attempt to rescue. Displaying superb airmanship and extraordinary heroism, he landed his aircraft near the point where the combat control team was reported to be hiding. While on the ground, his aircraft was the target of intense hostile fire. A rocket landed in front of the nose of the aircraft but failed to explode. Once the combat control team was aboard, Lt. Col. Jackson succeeded in getting airborne despite the hostile fire directed across the runway in front of his aircraft. Lt. Col. Jackson's profound concern for his fellow men, at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Air Force and reflect great credit upon himself, and the Armed Forces of his country.|$|E

The rarity of such spectacular failures of a corporation from securities fraud attests to the general reliability of most executives and boards of large corporations. Most spectacular failures of publicly traded companies result from such innocent causes as marketing blunders (Schlitz), an obsolete model of business (Penn Central, Woolworth's), inadequate market share (Studebaker), non-criminal incompetence (Braniff).|$|R

25|$|Due to the <b>extreme</b> <b>dangers</b> {{inherent}} with no man's land, specialized {{tools and}} methods were implemented {{to make the}} process quieter and more effective. Pickets, or metal posts, were originally used {{to hold up the}} wire and were hammered in by a muffled mallet. However, this still produced noise, rendering the sappers targets. Therefore, screw pickets or 'cork-screws' were produced. These looped steel posts had a drill-like end, allowing it to be twisted into the ground noiselessly and the wire then wrapped around it.|$|R

The paintings were produced by comic artist Ron Embleton, who would later illustrate the adult comic strips [...] "Oh, Wicked Wanda!" [...] and Sweet Chastity for Penthouse Magazine. In 2005, the Animation Art Gallery in London released licensed limited editions of the paintings signed by Francis Matthews, who had provided the voice of Captain Scarlet.|$|E

The tracks in the game include hills, loops, tunnels, corkscrews, and pipes. Players can drift into turns without losing momentum by using the control stick and trigger button. The game introduces 26 new vehicles, and reprises the 4 from the original F-Zero game. Each has its own performance abilities affected by its size and weight, and a grip, boost, and durability trait graded on an A to E (best to worst) scale. Before a race, players are able to adjust a vehicle's balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed.|$|E

5000|$|TATB is a {{powerful}} explosive (somewhat less powerful than RDX, but more than TNT), but it is extremely insensitive to shock, vibration, fire, or impact.

Later, he gave {{the impression that he}} had fought for the Spanish Republic and trained to fly a fighter with the Royal Air Force. Author Robert Jungk recounted in his book , the first published account of the Manhattan Project, that Slotin [...] "had volunteered for service in the Spanish Civil War, more {{for the sake of the}} thrill of it than on political grounds.
