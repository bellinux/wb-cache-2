40|$|Fuels {{for future}} fast {{reactors}} {{will not only}} produce energy, but they must also actively contribute to the minimisation of long lived wastes produced by these, and other reactor systems. The fuels must incorporate minor actinides (MA = Np, Am, Cm) for neutron transmutation into short lived isotopes. Within Europe oxide fuels are favoured. Transmutation can be considered in homogeneous or heterogeneous reactor recycle modes (i. <b>e.</b> <b>in</b> <b>fuels</b> or targets, respectively). Fabrication of such fuels {{can be made by}} advanced liquid processing methods, enabling property determination and screening irradiation experiments. This paper will describe these fabrication processes, and discuss properties and fuel irradiation experiments made to date. Both fertile and inert matrix fuel types are considered. JRC. DG.

In this paper we discuss the kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction in acidic media via mean-field modeling of surface adsorbents. We put a special focus {{on the importance of}} interactions between adsorbents. Our study is based on detailed ab-initio simulations of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters on the Pt(111) surface. The oxygen dissociation and the hydroperoxyl dissociation pathway are found to determine the overall reaction kinetics and to result in the double Tafel slope on Pt(111) ...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen is {{considered}} as a promising clean energy carrier that could replace fossil fuels. It can be produced by several ways including biological processes which are definitely environmental-safe methods. Unfortunately, the concentration of hydrogen in the gas mixture obtained during the fermentation process is not high enough for direct utilization (<b>e.</b> g. <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> cells) since there are other gases (mainly carbon-dioxide) present {{as a result of}} the microbial activity. In this work concentration of biohydrogen by gas separation membranes were aimed to study. Two different membrane modules were tested in order to obtain pure hydrogen. The permeabilities and selectivities for both membranes were determined by single gas experiments and the feasibility of the membranes for biohydrogen separation was discussed...|$|R
40|$|Sulfonated {{polysulfone}} (sPSU) membranes were analysed by nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (NMR) cryoporometry, conventional gravimetric water uptake measurements {{as well as by}} differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). NMR cryoporometry is based on the relation between the pore size and the melting point depression of the pore-filling liquid, i. <b>e.</b> water <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> cell membranes; thus providing a relation between the amount of molten water and the temperature shift, i. e. the pore size, in hydrated membranes. An sPSU membrane with high ion-exchange capacity (IEC 1. 45 mequiv. g- 1) possessed a significant amount of large pores after hydrothermal pre-treatment at 80 °C, which was related to its high hydrophilicity and low resistance towards swelling. An sPSU membrane with low IEC (0. 95 mequiv. g- 1) showed a significant fraction of small pores (r ~ 1 nm) after hydrothermal pre-treatment at 80 °C, implying a controlled water uptake of the membrane. NMR cryoporometry was also carried out on Nafion membranes, the results were found to be in agreement with the water uptake measurements and revealed a pore size distribution peak at r ~ 1 nm. The NMR cryoporometry, gravimetric water uptake and DSC results are also discussed in terms {{of the state of the}} water and methodological differences...|$|R
40|$|Going {{beyond its}} role as an encyclopedia, Wikipedia becomes a global memory place for high-impact events, such as, natu-ral {{disasters}} and manmade incidents, thus influencing collec-tive memory, i. e., the way we remember the past. Due {{to the importance of}} collective memory for framing the assessment of new situations, our actions and value systems, its open construction and negotiation in Wikipedia is an important new cultural and societal phenomenon. The analysis of this phenomenon does not only promise new insights in collec-tive memory. It is also an important foundation for tech-nology, which more effectively complements the processes of human forgetting and remembering and better enables us to learn from the past. In this paper, we analyse the long-term dynamics of Wikipedia as a global memory place for high-impact events. This complements existing work in analysing the collective memory negotiation and construction process in Wikipedia directly following the event. In more detail, we are interested in catalysts for reviving memories, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>in</b> the <b>fuel</b> that keeps memories of past events alive, interrupt-ing the general trend for fast forgetting. For this purpose, we study the trigger of revisiting behavior for a large set of event pages by exploiting page views and time series analy-sis, as well as identify of most important catalyst features...|$|R
40|$|Water {{confined}} {{into the}} interior channels of narrow carbon nanotubes or transmembrane proteins forms collectively oriented molecular wires held together by tight hydrogen bonds. Here, we explore the thermodynamic stability and dipolar orientation of such 1 D water chains from nanoscopic to macroscopic dimensions. We show that a dipole lattice model accurately recovers key properties of 1 D confined water when compared to atomically detailed simulations. In a major reduction in computational complexity, we represent the dipole model in terms of effective Coulombic charges, which allows us to study pores of macroscopic lengths in equilibrium with a water bath (or vapor). We find that at ambient conditions, the water chains filling the tube are essentially continuous up to macroscopic dimensions. At reduced water vapor pressure, we observe a 1 D Ising-like filling/emptying transition without a true phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. In the filled state, the chains of water molecules in the tube remain dipole-ordered up to macroscopic lengths of ≈ 0. 1 mm, and the dipolar order is estimated to persist for times up to ≈ 0. 1 s. The observed dipolar order in continuous water chains is a precondition {{for the use of}} nanoconfined 1 D water as mediator of fast long-range proton transport, <b>e.</b> g., <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> cells. For water-filled nanotube bundles and membranes, we expect anti-ferroelectric behavior, resulting in a rich phase diagram similar to that of a 2 D Coulomb gas...|$|R

Taking inspiration from natural systems, artificial photosynthesis is a technology to be for efficiently converting the tremendous solar energy received every day on Earth into chemical energy, i. <b>e.</b> <b>fuels.</b> <b>In</b> particular, hydrogen production through light-driven water splitting is the subject of numerous investigations. We focus here on the construction of electrodes and photoelectrodes achieving H 2 evolution, as components of photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. In such devices, H 2 evolution at the cathode or photocathode is combined with water oxidation to oxygen at the photoanode or anode. We review here the various molecular-based materials developed in this context with emphasis on those specifically exploiting the properties of Earth-abundant elements...|$|R

This work was however to use the PEO process to produce thin ceramic oxide coatings on an A 356 Al alloy for improving corrosion and wear resistance of the alloy.

40|$|Hand-held breath alcohol analyzers {{are widely}} used by police in traffic stops of drivers {{suspected}} of driving while intoxicated (DWI). E 85 is a motor fuel consisting of 85 % ethanol and 15 % gasoline or other hydro-carbons, and is available at nearly 2, 600 stations in the USA. We sought to determine whether handling E 85 fuel could produce measur-able breath alcohol results using a hand-held analyzer and {{to see if this}} would be a plausible explanation for a positive breath alcohol test. Five healthy adult subjects dispensed or transferred 8 US gallons of <b>E</b> 85 <b>fuel</b> <b>in</b> each of four scenarios. We measured breath alcohol con-centration in g/ 210 L of exhaled breath using the BACTrack S 50 at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 20 min after each fuel-handling scenario. Most of the subjects had no detectable breath alcohol after handling E 85 motor fuel. Transient elevations (0. 02 – 0. 04 g/ 210 L) in breath alcohol meas-urement occurred up to 6 min after handling <b>E</b> 85 <b>in</b> a minority of sub-jects.

First, optimizing the configuration and component sizing of a wheel loader to customer needs can lead to a significant improvement <b>in</b> <b>e.</b> g. <b>fuel</b> efficiency and cost. Second, relevant driving cycles {{to be used in the}} development of wheel loaders can be extracted from usage data. Third, on-line usage identification opens up for the possibility of implementing advanced look-ahead control strategies for wheel loader operation. The main objective here is to develop an on-line algorithm that automatically, using production sensors only, can extract information about the usage of a machine. Two main challenges are that sensors are not located with respect to this task and that significant usage disturbances typically occur during operation. The proposed method is based on a combination of several individually simple techniques using signal processing, state automaton techniques, and parameter estimation algorithms. The approach is found to berobust when evaluated on measured data of wheel loaders loading gravel and shot rock...|$|R

40|$|Changes in fire {{activity}} {{over the}} last 8000 years are simulated with a global fire model driven by changes in climate and vegetation cover. The changes were separated into those caused through variations <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> availability, fuel moisture or wind speed which react differently to changes in climate. Disentangling these controlling factors helps to understand the overall climate control on fire activity over the Holocene. Globally the burned area is simulated to increase by 2. 5 % between 8000 and 200 cal yr BP with larger regional changes compensating on a global scale. Despite the absence of anthropogenic fire ignitions, the simulated trends in fire activity agree reasonably well with continental scale reconstructions from charcoal records, {{with the exception of}} Europe. For some regions the change in fire activity is predominantly controlled through changes <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> availability (Australia-Monsoon, American Tropics/Subtropics). For other regions changes <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture are more important for the overall trend in fire activity (North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, Asia-Monsoon). In Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, changes <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture alone lead to an increase in fire activity between 8000 and 200 cal yr BP, while changes <b>in</b> <b>fuel</b> availability lead to a decrease. Overall, the fuel moisture control is dominating the simulated fire activity for Sub-Saharan Africa.
