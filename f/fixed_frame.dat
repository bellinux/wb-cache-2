40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{we present a}} {{framework}} for intelligent filming of an object moving in a wide field. We propose a new method of filming of the moving object by <b>fixed</b> <b>framing</b> of multiple pan-tilt cameras. This filming approach assures the acquisition of high resolution images of the object without blurring of its textures, which may occur when a conventional active tracking method is applied. Since the camera that is filming the object cannot be rotated in <b>fixed</b> <b>framing</b> approach, cameras which are not used for filming at that time should be directed beforehand so as to maximize the possibility of capturing the object by their <b>fixed</b> <b>framing</b> pose. To realize this system, we decouple the framing task into two parts, a monitoring part, and a stand-by part. We assign a monitoring role to one camera, and a stand-by role to other cameras. While the monitoring camera films the target, the motion information of this target is embedded into a marginal distribution through the projection of a probability density function onto the circumference of the image plane. Based on this new marginal distribution, the stand-by cameras predict the moving direction of the target. Each of thes...|$|R
