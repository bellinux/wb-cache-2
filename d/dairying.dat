5|$|During the 20th {{century the}} old wool {{industry}} in Frome declined, although the last fabric mill at Wallsbridge did not close until 1965. As a result, the population fell {{and in the}} 1930s it was slightly smaller {{than it had been}} in the mid 19th century. Other industries such as printing, light engineering, metal casting, carpeting and <b>dairying</b> continued, many taking old premises from the cloth mills and others being sited at the new Marston Road Trading Estate which led to growth after World War II, including the construction of council houses.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Waite {{returned}} to his Balclutha property which he converted to dairy farming. He remained {{a member of the}} TF for several years and was a major in the Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment before being promoted to lieutenant colonel and becoming its commander from 1927 to 1930. For his prolonged service with the TF, he eventually received the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration. In 1935 he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. Already involved in the <b>dairying</b> industry, he began to participate in the governance of the sector and set up the Co-Operative Dairy Company of Otago. He later joined the New Zealand Farmer's Union and was president of its Otago Branch.|$|E

5|$|Agriculture in Wales has in {{the past}} been {{a major part of the}} economy of Wales, a largely rural country that forms part of the United Kingdom. Wales is mountainous and has a mild, wet climate. This results in only a small {{proportion}} of the land area being suitable for arable cropping, but grass for the grazing of livestock is present in abundance. As a proportion of the national economy, the importance of agriculture has become much reduced; a high proportion of the population now live in the towns and cities in the south of the country and tourism has become an important form of income in the countryside and on the coast. Arable cropping is limited to the flatter parts and elsewhere <b>dairying</b> and livestock farming predominate.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture, and to {{a lesser}} extent forestry, are the main sources of income over most of the county of Carmarthenshire. On {{improved}} pastures, <b>dairying</b> is important and in the past, the presence of the railway enabled milk to be transported to the urban areas of England. The creamery at Whitland is now closed but milk processing still takes place at Newcastle Emlyn where mozzarella cheese is made. On upland pastures and marginal land, livestock rearing of cattle and sheep is the main agricultural activity. The estuaries of the Loughor and Towy provide pickings for the cockle industry.|$|E
5|$|Farming has {{traditionally}} been the basis of Cardiganshire's economy, with <b>dairying</b> and stock-rearing being the main occupations. Before the first railway was built in 1866, the stock used to be herded over the mountains to England, where Rugby, Northampton and London were important destinations. At one {{time there was a}} sizeable mining industry in Cardiganshire, but the reserves of lead, silver and zinc became unprofitable to mine by {{the early part of the}} twentieth century. Shipping was also important in the county, with coal and lime being imported in coastal vessels, and mineral ores and oak bark for tanning being exported. Shipbuilding was an important industry with most of Wales' sailing vessels being built in Cardiganshire.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{traces the}} material and social relations of <b>dairy</b> cows and <b>dairy</b> farmers in productionist <b>dairy</b> farming. Life story interviews and participant observation on <b>dairy</b> farms reveal how <b>dairy</b> cow/dairy farmer relationships take diverse forms in response to competing demands in productionist <b>dairy</b> farming. Seeking ways of understanding the complexities inherent in <b>dairy</b> cow/dairy farmer relationships, I enrolled <b>dairy</b> cows as ethnographic research participants. Embodied, sensory and empathic participant observation methods led to understandings of how humanimal relationships form across species boundaries. My research findings suggest that deeply embedded cultural narratives {{of what it means}} to be a “good farmer” may conflict with the multiplicity of “good cow” identities. <b>Dairy</b> cows create tension for <b>dairy</b> farmers: <b>dairy</b> farmers work with <b>dairy</b> cows as production machines; but also care for <b>dairy</b> cows as co-workers. This ethnographic humanimal research highlights how <b>dairy</b> cows and <b>dairy</b> farmers are not fixed as “good” or “bad”. Rather, through an anthropological appropriation of Actor Network Theory, this research highlights how <b>dairy</b> cow/dairy farmer networks form and reform (in part) through unintentional and intentional <b>dairy</b> cow agency...|$|R

50|$|As an attributive, {{the word}} <b>dairy</b> refers to milk-based products, {{derivatives}} and processes, {{and the animals}} and workers involved in their production: for example <b>dairy</b> cattle, <b>dairy</b> goat. A <b>dairy</b> farm produces milk and a <b>dairy</b> factory processes it {{into a variety of}} <b>dairy</b> products. These establishments constitute the global <b>dairy</b> industry, a component of the food industry.|$|R
5|$|<b>Dairying</b> is only {{economic}} in Wales with {{a sufficiently}} large herd in a productive lowland area. Hand-milking a few cows in a byre {{is a thing}} of the past and nowadays herds are milked by machine in modern parlours, two or three times a day. The milk passes by pipeline to the cooler and is stored in a refrigerated bulk tank and collected by milk tanker daily. In general, the cows graze outdoors in summer and spend their winter under cover, often in cubicles, the bulk of their feed being silage. Milk prices barely cover the costs of production, margins are tight, and there are fewer family-run dairy farms each year. In 2014, there were 1855 milk-producers in Wales, an annual decline of 1.23% since 2011, but the number of cows milked was nearly static at 223,000.|$|E

40|$|Tri-State <b>Dairy</b> Youth Expo {{has been}} a long {{standing}} program that has been in existence since the early 1980 ’s.

It began in 1984 at the Waterloo Cattle Congress as a <b>dairy</b> cattle judging show with commercial exhibits and informational seminars targeted mainly at <b>dairy</b> producers. As <b>dairy</b> farms changed and Iowa saw a decrease in <b>dairy</b> farms, the <b>dairy</b> sale diminished and locations changed from Waterloo to Dubuque to Decorah, and eventually to Calmar, Iowa. With the help of the Northeast Iowa Community College and Northeast Iowa <b>Dairy</b> Foundation, a youth program was created for students interested in the <b>dairy</b> industry.

The objective of this project is to assess how new <b>dairy</b> legislation has altered trends within levels of food waste of fluid milk, excess supply or surplus within the <b>dairy</b> industry, the modern landscape of <b>dairy</b> farming, and farming decisions made by <b>dairy</b> producers in response to federal policies. This study {{is part of a}} growing body of {{research on}} federal <b>dairy</b> policy and how it influences the <b>dairy</b> sector of U. S. agriculture. It has been found that when less government support is in place there are lower amounts of fluid milk food waste as well as lower surplus levels of manufactured <b>dairy</b> products. In addition, new <b>dairy</b> policy is associated with higher surplus levels of <b>dairy,</b> increases in the proportion of large farms in the U.
