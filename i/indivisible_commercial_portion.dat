50|$|As African Americans {{began to}} settle in Mount Pleasant, {{a new wave of}} {{immigrants}} from Central America came to the capital. Spanish-speaking immigrants began settling in Mount Pleasant in the 1960s, many from El Salvador and the Dominican Republic. Adams Morgan to the west already had a Latino population among its multi-racial residents, and they had developed businesses along Columbia Road and 18th Street that new immigrants found familiar. The new residents also developed businesses catering to Hispanics and Latinos along <b>commercial</b> <b>portions</b> of Mount Pleasant Street. The neighborhood also attracted former Peace Corps workers, who liked the diversity. Commercially developed Columbia Road extended from the Adams Morgan neighborhood to 16th Street. Businesses included grocery store and pharmacy, restaurants, low-priced retail stores and services.|$|R

A 50% reduction in the general Sales tax rate (from 7% to 3.5% as of July 15, 2006) and hiring incentives, are designed to reinvigorate the business climate within the Zone. These incentives {{have led to the}} construction of numerous malls and big-box retailers in parts of the development zone located near major highways, such as the Elizabeth Center and Jersey Gardens Outlet Center in the largely industrial city of Elizabeth along the New Jersey Turnpike. More than thirty of New Jersey's 566 municipalities now participate in the program.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the night}} of January 8, 1906, a {{landslide}} destroyed a large residential and <b>commercial</b> <b>portion</b> of the Village. Firefighters responded immediately but faced enormous odds because of burst valves and water mains, natural gas explosions and hoses which periodically froze because of the extreme cold. The landslide, a pit about 150 ft deep, claimed five Haverstraw blocks from Allison to Jefferson Street, 21 buildings, {{and the lives of}} 4 firefighters and 17 residents. Despite the events, the village rebounded. Eight years later, however, the Cleary-Newman murder took place, which cast a pall of corruption over the populace.

The <b>commercial</b> <b>portion</b> of the plant, used as food, comprises the innermost leaves (head) of plants harvested {{during the first}} year of growth; the outermost leaves and the roots are considered wastes. Three selections belonging to this variety have been analyzed for guaianolide and sugar contents and compared with the commercial product (head), roots and outermost leaves. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations of both classes of compounds were achieved by densitometric HPTLC. The analytical data showed a high variability during the stages of growth, both among the parts of the plant and among the three selections of chicory considered. With particular reference to the heads, a sensory bitterness evaluation method was set up in order to find a correlation between the analytical data and the bitter taste...|$|R
50|$|In 1988, {{family members}} and senior {{management}} of the company were outbid by the Danish textile firm, Northern Feather. The purchase of the company by Northern Feather would end the 100 year reign the family had over the company.

40|$|An {{improved}} {{model for}} estimating nutrient {{contents of the}} <b>commercial</b> <b>portion</b> of tree boles was developed for four boreal tree species (Populus tremuloides Michx., Betula papyrifera Marsh., Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, and Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). This model considers the spatial pattern of variation of nutrient concentrations inside the bole and its relationships with tree size. For all species-nutrient combinations, no significant pattern was found for vertical variations in nutrient concentrations, while two types of nonlinear models, using distance from the tree periphery as the independent variable, fit the pattern of horizontal (or radial) variations. These patterns of variability were used to estimate the global nutrient concentration of the bole by using mathematical integration. The values obtained with this method were generally lower, especially for large stems, than values obtained with traditional methods that do not consider the variability of nutrient concentrations inside the bole. This improved model would permit better estimates of the mounts of nutrients lost in biomass upon forest harvesting, as well as internal cycling of nutrients within the bole...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the total}} {{phenolic}} content, the antioxidant activity and toxicity of selected Greek medicinal aromatic namely Melissa officinalis L., Origanum vulgare L., Origanum dictamnus L., Salvia officinalis L. and Hyssopus officinalis L., were investigated under three different extraction processes. Among the plants studied, Melissa officinalis L. {{showed the highest values}} in total phenolic content (0. 985 ± 0. 001 mg caffeic acid/mL) and antioxidant activity (6. 61 ± 0. 04 mol Trolox/mL) {{independently of the}} extraction process. Toxicity evaluation of the infusions prepared in concentrations contained in <b>commercial</b> <b>portions</b> showed that inhibition values of Origanum vulgare L. and Origanum dictamnus L. were greater than 20 % thus further research is necessary. Although toxicity of plant extracts examined is not correlated to their total phenolic content and antioxidant activity, it was linked to the interaction of water soluble and volatile organic compounds. Interaction of water soluble and volatile organic compounds was evaluated through the estimation of synergism ratios (SR), where Origanum vulgare L., presented the maximum synergism (SR = 4. 2) in toxicity...|$|R

Most {{modifications}} to the program {{have been done in}} minute detail, such as to the show's book shelf display seen near the courtroom entrance. Aesthetically, the show's theme song, graphics, and color scheme are the only aspects that have changed repeatedly over its past eighteen years. The ninth season (2004-05) is one of few seasons in which the show underwent major remodeling when music for the show's opening, closing, and to/from <b>commercial</b> <b>portions</b> were modified. A modern version of a melody from Beethoven's 5th Symphony was then adopted as the show's opening theme song. This arrangement was composed by Non-Stop Music Productions. For its scenes, Sheindlin is shown in a different courtroom from her own (part of a proposed renovation to the courtroom that was rejected by Sheindlin for being too dark), approaching the camera, followed by folding her arms and smiling at the camera. This is followed by showing various scenes of her presiding over different cases. As part of these modifications, the show's introductory previews, graphics, and images all began showing up in falu red.|$|R
