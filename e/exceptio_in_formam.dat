60|$|The prejudice, {{that the}} {{conditions}} of a phenomenon must resemble the phenomenon, is occasionally exaggerated, at least verbally, into a still more palpable absurdity; {{the conditions of the}} thing are spoken of {{as if they were the}} very thing itself. In Bacon’s model inquiry, which occupies so great a space in the Novum Organum, the inquisitio <b>in</b> <b>formam</b> calidi, the conclusion which he favors is that heat is a kind of motion; meaning of course not the feeling of heat, but the conditions of the feeling; meaning, therefore, only that wherever there is heat, there must first be a particular kind of motion; but he makes no distinction in his language between these two ideas, expressing himself as if heat, and the conditions of heat, were one and the same thing. So the elder Darwin, in the beginning of his Zoonomia, says, “The word idea has various meanings in the writers of metaphysics; it is here used simply for those notions of external things which our organs of sense bring us acquainted with originally” (thus far the proposition, though vague, is unexceptionable in meaning), “and is defined a contraction, a motion, or configuration, of the fibres which constitute the immediate organ of sense.” Our notions, a configuration of the fibres! What kind of logician must he be who thinks that a phenomenon is defined to be the condition on which he supposes it to depend? Accordingly he says soon after, not that our ideas are caused by, or consequent on, certain organic phenomena, but “our ideas are animal motions of the organs of sense.” And this confusion runs through the four volumes of the Zoonomia; the reader never knows whether the writer is speaking of the effect, or of its supposed cause; of the idea, a state of mental consciousness, or of the state of the nerves and brain which he considers it to presuppose.|$|R

40|$|Imposed {{protection}} can {{be traced}} in Roman law in several forms: {{the application of the}} criterion of good faith (bona fides) by the judge, especially in contractual relations. Outside this sphere a special legal remedy for the defendant was introduced through the <b>exceptio</b> doli, introduced <b>in</b> 69 BC. Imposed protection is also visible in early family law since the Law of the XII Tables (450 BC), pertaining to children and women. Further legal measures were taken in the form of protective statutes (leges, e. g. Lex Cincia against impulsive donations) and in the form of decisions of the Senate (Senatus Consulta), e. g. the SC Vellaeanum protecting women and the SC Macedonianum protecting sons. In their turn the rules concerning mistake of law do have protective elements for groups of persons, women, minors, farmers and soldiers.

40|$|Modern law of {{contract}} in South-Africa {{can be seen as}} a dynamic field of law. It encompasses key principles such as freedom {{of contract}}, autonomy, good faith and public policy. These principles are seen as important concepts that underlie the substantive {{law of contract}}. The Consumer Protection Act, introduced in 2008 and operational since 31 March 2011, has contributed to this dynamic field of law. Unfortunately the uncertainties regarding the application of widely articulated definitions associated with the act remain a concern. Many legal academics have tried to alleviate the possible difficulties posed by the application of the CPA by means of constructive criticism, in-depth analysis of practical aspects and submissions to the legislator during the past three years. The exceptio doligeneralis has offered similar protection for consumers in circumstances where it seemed as if no remedy would provide a similar equitable outcome. This defence was available when a plaintiff wanted to enforce legal action in circumstances that are unconscionable. The defendant could raise these circumstances as a defence to the action of enforcement. The potential difficulties associated with the CPA are not entirely similar to the uncertainties created by the application of the <b>exceptio</b> doli <b>in</b> the past. The widely articulated definitions present a bigger problem of uncertainty. This may in certain circumstances be to the detriment of the consumer. Consumers are afforded rights in terms of the CPA but it does not necessarily mean that the enforcement of these afforded rights is in place. There are technical difficulties regarding the interpretation of terms such as “agreement”, “unfair tactics” or “pressure” to name but a few. There are still no guidelines provided to assist consumer tribunals to adhere to the purpose of the act in a fair and organised manner. The question that arises is whether these afforded rights seem better than what it actually is; leaving us to believe that the common law regarding consumer protection can be codified. This study is an attempt to demonstrate that the CPA might not have the desired outcome as initially anticipated. The CPA unfortunately, in my opinion, represents an April fool’s day. Sections 40, 48 and 51 of the CPA will perhaps have a similar effect than the exceptio doligeneralis. These sections offer protection to a consumer if there are unfair, unreasonable or unjust circumstances. The widely articulated sections create an inclusive protecting mechanism rather than excluding. Any contract, term or clause thereof will be interpreted in such a way to benefit a consumer. It is submitted that it will not be possible to attach precise meanings to concepts such as good faith, public interest or fairness. There will always be a different understanding in a particular language and within a variation of context. The main goal to be achieved, the rules of the law of contract should reflect attempts to achieve a balance between fundamental principles such as fairness and good faith, and economic policies such as economic efficiency and the facilitation of honest market participation.

40|$|The {{question}} {{to which this}} study will attempt to find a satisfactory answer, is whether the new Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA) has revived the abolished exceptio doli generalis. The exceptio doli was introduced in about 66 BC by the praetor Gaius Aquilius Gallus. An exceptio was a legal defence to a claim. The exceptio doli required the judge {{to take account of}} the fraud of which the plaintiff had been guilty of at the time of concluding the transaction, or of the dolus of which the plaintiff was guilty in actually instituting the action. It appears that the provisions of sections 40, 41 and 48 of the CPA reaffirm the existence of the <b>exceptio</b> doli generalis <b>in</b> the South African law of contract, since these provisions provide the same function and outcome that defence did. The section that speaks {{to the heart of the}} exceptio doli generalis, is section 40 (1) which provides that a supplier or an agent of the supplier must not use physical force, coercion, undue influence, pressure, duress or harassment, unfair tactics or any other similar conduct, in connection with the supply of services to a consumer and also in the negotiation, conclusion, execution or enforcement of an agreement. Section 52 of the Act deals with contraventions of sections 40, 41 and 48 of the Act. It grants the ordinary courts the power to declare agreements, in whole or in part, unfair or unconscionable. That only the ordinary courts would have jurisdiction in respect of unfair contract terms, is not stated unequivocally, but is implicit in the absence of any reference to the NCT or provincial consumer courts in section 52. It is a well-known fact that the costs, risks and effort of court action are just too high for ordinary consumers, including middle class consumers. For this reason it is unlikely that this legislation in its current form will have a real impact on the eradication of unfair contract enforcement. What is suggested, is an amendment to section 52 in order to bestow jurisdiction on the NCT and the consumer courts as well may also make any further order it considers just and As an alternative to the amendment of section 52, it is submitted that the legislature should create a statutory rule, because it seems that the exceptio doli generalis as well as the CPA are not up to the task. What is suggested, is legislation that deals specifically and exclusively with unreasonableness, unconscionableness and oppressiveness in contracts or terms of contract. The enactment of legislation dealing specifically with the problems previously dealt with by applying the exceptio doli generalis, will ensure that legal certainty is created as to the availability of a remedy in circumstances where the enforcement of a contract is unfair. This is in accordance with the proposal made by the South African Law Commission’s Project 47. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012. Private LawLLMUnrestricte...|$|R

The Charters of Justice of 1827 and 1832 reorganised the administration of justice in the Cape colony. An independent supreme court with professional judges was created and the laws of criminal and civil procedure were reformed. Absence of the curia ius novit rule frustrated the aspired assimilation of colonial law to British jurisprudence. This rule instructs the judge to find and apply the law ex officio, but in common law the English judge limits himself to the legal arguments raised by parties. Thus reception of Roman-Dutch law depended to a large extent on the legal practitioners in the Cape. The pre- 1828 advocates were all doctors of law who had studied in the Netherlands. The Charters of Justice did not introduce the binding force of precedent, but it has been generally accepted that from the earliest days of the Cape supreme court this doctrine constituted an essential element of South African common law.

In Brink’s Trustees v South African Bank the trustees of the insolvent Brink offered to pay the bank the amount of the secured debt in return for the transferred security. The bank refused this offer, maintaining that Brink’s other, unsecured, debts to the bank had to be repaid first. Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that Codex 8, 26, 1 granted the bank a jus retentionis against Brink himself until all other debts due by him to the bank had been paid. However, this right of retention could not be exercised against his creditors after his insolvency, since the remedy to enforce the right of retention, the exceptio doli mali, could not be pleaded against the other creditors of the insolvent debtor. Insolvency had divested the latter of his whole estate and vested it in the general body of the creditors, represented by the trustees. Counsel relied on Roman-Dutch law, European ius commune, colonial law, Scottish law, Anglo-American common law, and a Chancery decision. Counsel for the defendant relied more on Dutch and continental authors and maintained that Codex 8, 26, 1 granted the ius retentionis not only against the debtor himself, but also against all persons deriving any right from him or through him, except a secundus creditor hypothecarius. The court gave judgment for the plaintiffs and no grounds were reported, which provides an excellent example of Denis Cowen’s observation that while in form our law is largely judge-made, the work of the judge is often the work of intelligent selection, as in many instances judges simply put the stamp of the state’s authority on propositions which counsels have worked out for them in advance. In Bank of Lisbon and South Africa v De Ornelas the Ornelas Fishing Company paid off the overdraft and closed its account with the bank. The De Ornelas brothers demanded return of the securities provided, which the bank refused to do until the outcome of an action which the bank intended to institute against the company for damages resulting from alleged breach of contract. The court a quo upheld the application for the return of the furnished securities, against which judgment the bank appealed. For the bank it was argued that the application was based on the replicatio doli and that the exceptio doli did not exist anymore in modern law, which argument was founded on a long list of precedents. The respondents maintained that the bank was attempting to use the securities for a purpose not intended by the parties when the contracts were concluded. Such an attempt to abuse a right would constitute unconscionable conduct and result in gross injustice or great inequity. Again the argument was nearly exclusively based on case law. The fact that the Codex text remained unmentioned may be explained by the conclusion drawn by Chorus, namely that each time a text from the Corpus Iuris is used by a court in a precedent system, the text in question ceases to be a source of law as it has been replaced by the decision which serves as precedent. The citation of Brink’s Trustees can be explained only by the supposition that the 19 th century fell outside the scope of counsel’s concept of relevance. The question arises whether the absence of curia ius novit does prohibit independent judicial research. In the 1876 decision of Mills and Sons v Trustee of Benjamin Bros De Villiers DJ had attended counsels to the possible application of constitutum possessorium and given them the opportunity of handing in authorities on this point. In the Lisbon case Joubert JA limited himself to the legal question as determined by the parties, but undertook a thorough investigation into the origin, development, scope and applicability of the exceptio doli. The court decided on the basis of primary and secondary sources that the supersession of the formula procedure by the cognitio extraordinaria was the end of the exceptio doli as a technical term of pleading; that as the result of the new rule pacta sunt servanda and new principle that all contracts were regulated by good faith, the exceptio doli was never part of Roman-Dutch law. Joubert JA held that all sources deviating from this decision, such as Donellus, Brunneman, Zoesius, Tuldenus, Voet, Van der Keessel, Van der Linden et al. stated Roman law and not Roman-Dutch law. Finally, the court was of the opinion that the previous dicta of the appellate division relative to this defence were not binding. Thus the observation that once a Roman law or Roman-Dutch law text has been recepted by a court, such text is replaced by the decision which now serves as precedent has been proven correct in the Lisbon case where counsel deemed it superfluous to research outside precedent and outside a certain period. Another conclusion is that absence of the curia ius novit rule in common law does not prevent judicial research, although in the common law tradition such research is critically received as motivated by the desire to ignore precedent. The merits of the judgment in the Lisbon case are not discussed, but a concluding remark is made that judicial research involving reception or rejection of Roman law is increasingly unlikely in modern South African law since the Latin requirement for a law degree has been abolished.
