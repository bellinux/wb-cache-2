500|$|Overmars {{signed for}} Arsenal in June 1997. The fee was {{reported}} to be between £5million and £7million, with the player on a five-year contract, paid £18,000 per week.

[...] Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger believed Overmars had his [...] "best years ahead of him" [...] and met his criteria of a player [...] "used to the pressures of playing for a big club and everything that goes with it". He opined that Arsenal lost the Premier League at home the previous season – [...] "we were maybe the best away team," [...] and commented on their inability to play expansive football.

He stated, [...] "I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia [...] Natalie embodied all those traits and more". Portman was unfamiliar with Star Wars before being cast, but was enthusiastic about being cast as a character she expected to become a role model.

The writer behind the God of War video games, Marianne Krawczyk, said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos: [...] "The player has a personal experience with him, and then he's going to be embodied by a different actor, he's going to have a different voice, he's going to say a lot more words.

2500|$|The harsh {{reception}} that Vestiges received, and the mockery {{which was}} made of its evolutionary ideas, has been cited by some historians as a factor leading to Darwin's caution in publishing his own theory of evolution. In a letter to Thomas Henry Huxley in 1854 (five years before his own book on evolution was published but twelve years after its ideas had first been sketched out in an unpublished essay), Darwin expressed sympathy for the (still anonymous) author of Vestiges {{in the face of}} a savage review by Huxley: [...] "I must think that such a book, if it does no other good, spreads the taste for Natural Science. But I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox about species as the Vestiges itself, though I hope not quite so unphilosophical." [...] However, later the same year, in a letter to Hooker, Darwin mentioned Vestiges in a more sober tone: [...] "I should have less scruple in troubling you if I had any confidence what my work would turn out. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> good, at other times I really feel as much ashamed of myself as the author of the Vestiges ought to be of himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the book}} has always been popular and {{considered}} a children's classic by many literary critics, a number of prominent individuals have spoken unfavorably of the novel over the years. Children's novelist and literary historian John Rowe Townsend has described the book as [...] "fantasy of an almost literally nauseating kind" [...] and accused it of [...] "astonishing insensitivity" [...] regarding the original portrayal of the Oompa-Loompas as black pygmies, although Dahl did revise this in later editions. Another novelist, Eleanor Cameron, compared the book to the sweets that form its subject matter, commenting that it is [...] "delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare."Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (together with Charlotte's Web [...] ) is probably the book most read aloud by those teachers who have no idea, apparently, what other books they might read to the children. Charlie, again along with Charlotte's Web, is always {{at the top of}} the best sellers among children's books, put there by fond aunts and grandmothers and parents buying it as the perfect gift, knowing no better. And I do think this a most curious coupling: on the one hand, one of the most tasteless books ever written for children; and on the other, one of the best. We are reminded of Ford Madox Ford's observation that only two classes of books are universal in their appeal: the very best and the very worst. [...] is like candy (the chief excitement and lure of Charlie) in that it is delectable and soothing while we are undergoing the brief sensory pleasure it affords but leaves us poorly nourished with our taste dulled for better fare. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> admitted of the average TV show that goes on from week to week that there is no time, either from the point of view of production or the time allowed for showing, to work deeply at meaning or characterisation. All interest depends upon the constant, unremitting excitement of the turns of plot. And if character or likelihood of action – that is, inevitability – must be wrenched to fit the necessities of plot, there is no time to be concerned about this either by the director or by the audience. Nor will the tuned-in, turned-on, keyed-up television watcher give the superficial quality of the show so much as a second thought. He has been temporarily amused; what is there to complain about? And like all those nursing at the electronic bosom in McLuhan's global village (as he likes to call it), so everybody in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory is enclosed in its intoxicating confines forever: all the workers, including the little Oompa-Loompas brought over from Africa and, by the end of the book, Charlie and his entire family.}} ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{title track}} and opening song, [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", was {{compared}} to her debut single, [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), featuring a slap-and-pop bassline, synthesizer chord stabs and a mechanized beat. Lyrically, the song sees Spears warning to an overeager prospective lover: [...] "Oops, you think I'm in love/That I'm sent from above — I'm not that innocent." [...] The song also breaks down for a spoken-word interlude, involving {{a line from the}} film Titanic (1997). The second track [...] "Stronger" [...] is a synthpop and R track, which is lyrically a declaration of independence, where Spears leaves a partner who treats her like property. The line [...] "my loneliness ain't killing me no more" [...] makes reference to the verse [...] "my loneliness is killing me" [...] from her song [...] "...Baby One More Time". Another R track, which also adds a bit more funk to the mix, [...] "Don't Go Knocking on My Door" [...] finds Spears confidently forging ahead after a breakup. The fourth track, a cover of the Rolling Stones' [...] "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", begins with mushy guitar plucking and breathy coos, until a dry, crackling lockstep is thrown down, turning the song into an urban stomp. The dance-pop version also jettisons the song's final verse and adds some new lyrics ("how white my shirts could be" [...] becomes [...] "how tight my skirt should be"). [...] " [...] was my idea [...] ", Spears said. [...] "I was just like, 'I like this song,' and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a really cool combination working with [...] Rodney [...] and doing a really funky song like that." [...] The fifth track, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", was co-written by country-pop singer-songwriter Shania Twain and her then-husband, producer Robert [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who also produced the track. The ballad, which boasts a slinky keyboard riff and Lange's characteristically lavish production, finds Spears allowing a bit of country twang into her vocals as she begs a lover to reveal his feelings: [...] "My friends say you're into me ... but I need to hear it straight from you", she sings. The sixth track [...] "What U See (Is What U Get)" [...] demands respect by rebuking a jealous partner, while the seventh track, [...] "Lucky", is a heart-rending tale of a Hollywood starlet's loneliness, proving that fame can be empty. [...] "If there's nothing missing in my life/Then why do these tears come at night?", she asks. [...] "School crush" [...] is the theme of [...] "One Kiss from You", a track that has a reggae-style beat and lyrics about the feelings of falling in love, and the quickness of it, with Spears cooing that after only one kiss she sees her entire future with her lover. The ballad [...] "Where Are You Now" [...] talks about wanting to know where a previous love is, and what that person is up to, so that she can finally let them go and find closure. Lines on [...] "Can't Make You Love Me", an Europop song, state that fancy cars and money pale in comparison to true love, with Spears singing: [...] "I'm just a girl with a crush on you." [...] The mid-tempo, synth-backed [...] "When Your Eyes Say It", written by songwriter Diane Warren, combines a string section with a loping hip hop beat, while Spears makes her own songwriting debut on the modest, keyboard-driven ballad [...] "Dear Diary", which she said is autobiographical. On the track, she sings of wanting to become [...] "so much more than friends" [...] with a boy.|$|E
