5|$|Game {{director}} Shigeki Morimoto {{aimed to}} respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> new game to those that {{were introduced to the}} series in more recent years. The games have received positive reviews from critics, and as of March 2014, the games' combined sales have reached 12.72 million, making the two games combined the eight best-selling DS game of all time.|$|E
5|$|The {{thing about}} that song, it's such a passionate song. I had to present it in a passionate way, and I used mythology to tell the story, {{with the story of}} the Minotaur, the matador, {{fighting}} for love. And the color red. And flowers. Horns, and death. And naked men. You know, the important things in life. I don't want to make every video the same. But I did love the richness of that video. To me it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> painting that came to life. That's what I was trying to do.|$|E
5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving before he got a chance to sit in his lap <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E

5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that {{he knew what he was}} doing.|$|E
5|$|This {{community}} {{also saw}} close collaboration between architects, specialist structural engineers, and building contractors emerge {{on the new}} skyscraper projects. Historically the industry had been dominated by individuals and small firms who combined the roles of architect and engineer, but this broke down in Chicago during the period, being replaced by a partnership between specialist architects who focused on {{the appearance of the}} skyscraper, and specialist engineers who focused on the structures that enabled it to be built. Chicago architectural firms grew to be large, hierarchical and with numerous specialist staff; the D. H. Burnham & Company, for example, <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small factory to visitors, and ultimately expanded to employ 180 staff.|$|E
5|$|In Granny's Cafe, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) throws darts at {{a picture}} of a deer very accurately. Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrives but leaves {{immediately}} because she has not forgiven him for hiding his relationship with Regina (Lana Parrilla). Emma attempts to avoid conversation, but Graham is insistent on explaining to her he feels nothing for Regina. He kisses Emma and suddenly sees a vision of a wolf, only to have Emma push him away. Frustrated by Emma's lack of understanding, Graham later sleeps with Regina. During the night, he awakens abruptly from a dream of a deer and a wolf. When Graham tells Regina that the dream <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> memory, Regina tries to convince him to stay, but Graham leaves. As Graham attempts to get to his car, the wolf from his visions appears next to him, startling him before it leaves. As he tries to find the wolf in the woods, he runs into Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle). Graham tells him about the wolf, and Mr. Gold suggests to him that dreams are memories from another life.|$|E

The {{games are}} part of the Pokémon series of role-playing video games, and were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. First released in Japan on September 12, 2009, the games were later released to North America, Australia, and Europe during March 2010. Game director Shigeki Morimoto aimed to respect the feelings of those who played the previous games, while also ensuring that it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> new game to those that were introduced to the series in more recent years. Reception to the games was highly positive, the two being amongst the highest rated DS games of all time on Metacritic. Commercially, the two are among the best-selling Nintendo DS games of all time, with combined sales of 10million units as of July 29, 2010.|$|E
25|$|York had {{experienced}} freedom on his adventures with Lewis and Clark. He {{was part of}} the team and he contributed just like the rest with hunting, fishing, putting up tents etc. He had crossed rivers and mountains on the expedition and had a taste of what true freedom is like. On the expedition he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> free man, and then when he returned east he was a slave again, in a world where there was slavery and bondage.|$|E
25|$|Disappointed {{with the}} {{indifference}} of European cultural elites to their ideas, the trio returned home. Back in Saint Petersburg Gippius's health deteriorated, {{and for the}} next six years she (along with her husband, who had heart problems) regularly visited European health resorts and clinics. During one such voyage in 1911 Gippius bought a cheap apartment in Paris, at Rue Colonel Bonnet, 11-bis. What at the time <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> casual, unnecessary purchase, later saved them from homelessness abroad.|$|E

25|$|From 1989 to 1997, Ali {{attended}} King Edward VI Five Ways School. He {{has said}} that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> misfit at his school, being {{one of only a handful}} of Muslims in the overwhelmingly Anglo student body. As a youth, he found himself torn between an Islamic upbringing and the Birmingham's thriving club scene. In his late teens and early twenties, Ali entrenched himself in the urban Hip hop music scene, a lifestyle of late nights and partying that he said eventually left him disillusioned.|$|E
25|$|In {{designing}} the Jedi Master Yoda, Stuart Freeborn used {{his own face}} as a model and added the wrinkles of Albert Einstein for the appearance of exceptional intelligence. Sets for Dagobah were built five feet above the stage floor, allowing puppeteers to crawl underneath and hold up the Yoda puppet. The setup presented communication problems for Frank Oz, who portrayed Yoda, as he was underneath the stage and unable to hear the crew and Mark Hamill above. Hamill later expressed his dismay at being the only human character on set for months; he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> trivial element {{on a set of}} animals, machines, and moving props. Kershner commended Hamill for his performance with the puppet.|$|E
25|$|For Bavaria itself Charles Theodore did {{less than}} nothing. He <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{foreigner}} among foreigners, and his favourite scheme, {{the subject of}} endless intrigues with the Austrian cabinet and the immediate cause of Frederick II's League of Princes (Fürstenbund) of 1785, was to exchange Bavaria for the Austrian Netherlands and the title of king of Burgundy. For the rest, the enlightened internal policy of his predecessor was abandoned. The funds of the suppressed Society of Jesus, which Maximilian Joseph had destined for the reform of the educational system of the country, were used to endow a province of the knights of St John of Jerusalem, {{for the purpose of}} combating the enemies of the faith. The government was inspired by the narrowest clericalism, which culminated in the attempt to withdraw the Bavarian bishops from the jurisdiction of the great German metropolitans and place them directly under that of the pope. On the eve of the Revolution the intellectual and social condition of Bavaria remained that of the Middle Ages.|$|E

Mishima, dubious of Takechi's experimental approach to classical theater, later commented that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> father allowing a disreputable plastic surgeon {{to operate on}} his child. Also at Sankei Hall, Takechi directed Mishima's Sotoba Komachi, set as an opera by composer Mareo Ishiketa, in 1956.|$|E
500|$|Musician, activist, {{and writer}} CN Lester listed some {{ways in which}} the show perpetuated misconceptions or {{otherwise}} fell short, but still saw it as {{a turning point in the}} representation of transgender people on television: [...] "It <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> game changer.

500|$|Baker's lifelong {{ambition}} was to write. Upon {{graduating from}} UCLA, he spent approximately five years writing Hollywood screenplays {{in the early}} 1980s, a process he hated. While financially successful, he was frustrated that his work was not being produced. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> door-to-door salesman going to all these [...] pitch meetings ... rabid, hideous morons". [...] He became discouraged and disillusioned, and {{turned his attention to}} novels.|$|E

I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lot of people may not hear that message and a lot of people need to. It wasn't to be preachy. A lot of times people will hear songs that I write that are not the typical songs people look at as 'Mariah Carey songs.' ...|$|E
