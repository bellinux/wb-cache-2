500|$|In {{search of}} a {{replacement}} for the light rail project, the new Government sent experts to examine an innovative <b>guided</b> <b>bus</b> system being developed in West Germany by Daimler-Benz. From the German Omnibus (bus) and Bahn (railway, as in S-Bahn and U-Bahn), the O-Bahn system was developed for use in tram tunnels in Essen. After extensive consultations with German authorities, State Transport Authority engineers decided the O-Bahn could be used. The system was seen as far superior to previous proposals; it used less land, made less noise, was faster and cost less. In addition, its unique feature of a non-transfer service direct from suburban streets to the city centre made it more attractive. Plans were drawn up for a length of : initially only [...] were to be constructed as O-Bahn, with the rest being conventional busway. However, safety concerns and public opposition led to O-Bahn being used for the entire length. Construction began in 1983 for the first section to Paradise Interchange. Another change of Government in 1982 resulted in uncertainty {{over the future of}} the project. The John Bannon Government, after consultations, decided to continue with Stage 1 (City to Paradise) and in 1986 proceeded with Stage 2 (Paradise to Tea Tree Plaza). The cost of the project was A$98million, including the buses.|$|E

2500|$|Leeds' tram {{system was}} {{dismantled}} {{in the early}} 1950s (as {{was the case in}} most cities) with the final services running in November 1959. In recent years this decision has become regarded as short-sighted. [...] The former tram routes are evident on some of the main roads {{in and out of the}} city; for instance the void in the A64 York Road, now filled with <b>guided</b> <b>bus</b> lanes, and the unusually wide central reservation between the carriageways on the A58 Easterly Road (towards Wetherby). [...] The original tram system ran a larger route than the proposed supertram; the original system ran along the A64, A58, A61, A660 and also down through Beeston and Belle Isle. [...] By the time the tram network was dismantled it had become unpopular with many people in Leeds due to its ageing, draughty, poorly maintained fleet. [...] Neighbouring Bradford lost its trolley bus system during the same era (the final journey being made in 1972). [...] Sheffield also lost its tram system several years earlier, yet has seen the return of the tram in the early 1990s.|$|E
