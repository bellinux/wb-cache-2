50|$|The eastern <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> {{is found}} only in Southern Texas, Veracruz, Mexico, and ArizonaThe Molina <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> also known as Andes skunk, (C. chinga) is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and Uruguay. <b>Humboldt's</b> <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> also known as Patagonian <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> (C. humboldtii) finds its habitat in the open grassy areas in the Patagonian regions of Chile and Argentina. The western <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> (C. mesoleucus) is found in, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Sierra Guadalupe, Coahuila, Colima, Honduras, Sonora, and Nicaragua. The striped <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> C. semistriatus is found in Veracruz, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.|$|R
50|$|The fauna of the Andean Patagonian forest {{region is}} very varied with many endemic species. Predatory mammals include the cougar (Felis concolor), the culpeo (Lycalopex culpaeus), the {{southern}} river otter (Lontra provocax) and the Geoffroy's cat (Leopardus geoffroyi). Other mammals include <b>Humboldt's</b> <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> (Conepatus humboldtii), the Patagonian mara (Dolichotis patagonum), the guanaco (Lama guanicoe), the south Andean deer (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and numerous species of rodents.|$|R
40|$|The study {{explores the}} work of the English {{choreographer}} and Director of the Birmingham Royal Ballet, David Bintley. Particular reference is made to Bintley’s ballet Still Life at the Penguin Café (1988) {{and the extent to which}} he has drawn from English Cotswold Morris dance in the <b>Humboldt’s</b> <b>Hog-nosed</b> <b>Skunk</b> Flea section of the ballet. The comparison between Bintley’s selection of movements and their traditional Morris dance counterparts is based on findings from extensive fieldwork conducted with Morris dance teams and in particular the Ravensbourne Morris Men of Keston in Kent, as well as a study of Bintley’s creative practice. The research draws from ethnographic modes of study including participant observation, embodiment and notions of reflexivity. Following an analysis of the results from the creation and performance of a more authentically ‘Morris’ version of Bintley’s dance for eight female dancers, entitled Still Life at the Folk Café, the study offers a series of recommendations for the translation of English Morris into a theatrical setting. The thesis is divided into six chapters. The first explores the methods involved in the development of the analytical model for the study, including those of the Hungarian scholars György Martin and Erno Pesovár during their folk dance research in the Upper-Tisza region of Hungry, and the categorisation of the various aspects of Morris dance using Morris dancer Lionel Bacon's motif catalogue, A handbook of Morris dances. It also reviews {{the work of}} folk dance theorists such as John Forrest and Chris Bearman. The second chapter discusses the concept of Englishness to define the importance of the English ballet tradition as advocated from 1926 by the founder of the Royal Ballet, Dame Ninette De Valois. It looks at Bintley's influences, ideological inheritance, creative process and place as a protector of the English ballet tradition. Chapter three focuses on the fieldwork conducted with the Ravensbourne Morris Men, and compares Bintley’s movements in <b>Humboldt’s</b> <b>Hog-nosed</b> <b>Skunk</b> Flea dance with their counterparts from the Cotswold Morris tradition. Chapter four details the practice based element of the research and analyses the findings from a series of Morris dance workshops in which the eight female dancers representing the field of professional dance were introduced to the Morris dance form. It also investigates the results from the creation and performance of Still Life at the Folk Café. Chapter five discusses the benefits of conducting a workshop with the Ravensbourne Morris dance team and some of the dancers involved in the performance process. Finally chapter six explores the conclusions drawn from the research and explains how choreographers or dancers wishing to work with Morris dance should immerse themselves in the source language of its practitioners, and draw from aspects of the tradition in rehearsals and performances in order to extend their choreological and physical vocabulary and attain the stylistic and social qualities associated with the dance form. These aspects include working with live musical accompaniment, using the performance space informally to maintain close interaction with the audience and challenging the dancer’s personal response to their own movement style...|$|R
50|$|Before the merge of the American <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks,</b> {{the eastern}} <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> Conepatus leuconotus is {{typically}} {{larger than the}} western <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> Conepatus mesoleucus.

50|$|The <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks</b> {{belong to}} the genus Conepatus and {{are members of the}} family Mephitidae (skunks). They are native to the Americas. They have white backs and tails and black underparts.|$|R
50|$|Its flora is countless and beautiful, {{including}} important {{groups of}} Puya Raimondi. In its fauna, there are tarucas, spectacled bears, vicuñas, pumas, foxes, vizcachas, weasels, Andean mountain cats, opossums, <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|The American <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> has stocky {{legs and}} {{plantigrade}} feet (the entire sole {{of the foot}} touches the ground). Its hind feet are broad and large with soles that are naked for about one-half their length. Its upper body is powerfully built, and the fore claws are very long. Length can range from 44.4 - 93.4 cm and weight is typically 1,130 - 4,500 g. The striped skunk can broadly overlap in size with this species, but in comparison the striped, has a shorter head-and-body length and a longer tail than the <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk.</b> Males of this species average about 10% larger than females.|$|R
50|$|Among the mammals {{reported}} {{from the same}} area are: the colocolo, the Andean mountain cat, the spectacled bear, the taruca deer, the vicuña, the white-tailed deer, the puma, the northern viscacha, the long-tailed weasel, the <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk</b> and the Andean fox.|$|R
50|$|Molina’s <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> Conepatus chinga, {{is similar}} to the common skunk with scent glands used to spray an odorous liquid to offend {{potential}} predators. They have a resistance to pit viper venom, distinct thin white markings and a pink, hog-like, fleshy nose.|$|R
50|$|Skunk species vary in {{size from}} about 15.6 to 37 in long and in weight from about 1.1 lb (spotted skunks) to 18 lbs kg (<b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks).</b> They have {{moderately}} elongated bodies with relatively short, well-muscled legs and long front claws for digging.|$|R
50|$|The striped <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> Conepatus semistriatus, is a skunk {{species from}} Central and South America (from {{southern}} Mexico to northern Peru, {{and in the}} extreme east of Brazil).

50|$|Although {{both the}} spotted skunk and common skunks live mainly on insects, the <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunks</b> {{are even more}} insectivorous in their feeding habits.

50|$|Foraging mainly at night, the skunk is {{omnivorous}} eating birds, small mammals, eggs, insects, leaves, and fruit. The tooth morphology in the molina’s <b>hog-nosed</b> <b>skunk,</b> {{is different}} than most mammals in that their teeth are adapted to their omnivorous diet with grinding being the main function of the carnassial apparatus.|$|R
