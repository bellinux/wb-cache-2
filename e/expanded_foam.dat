5000|$|Direct {{injection}} <b>expanded</b> <b>foam</b> molding (also {{known as}} injection molded foam) is a foam manufacturing process that creates soft foam products direct from compound into a final product.

40|$|This project studied <b>expanding</b> <b>foam</b> as a {{possible}} mechanism to attenuate the impact of small payloads deployed from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Current mechanisms, such as paper honeycomb, occupy a significant volumetric fraction of UAV payload capacity. Hypotheses were formulated regarding the performance of <b>expanding</b> <b>foam</b> as compared to honeycomb using the metrics: crush thickness efficiency, predeployment volume, and foam expansion reliability. These metrics were evaluated for a payload with a vertical descent rate of 13. 5 feet per second and a 50 g impact shock limit. The experiment concluded that the crush efficiency of <b>expanding</b> <b>foam</b> is at least 72. 7 % of the crush efficiency of paper honeycomb, thus proving the hypothesis regarding crush efficiency. The <b>expanding</b> <b>foam</b> is 83 % reliable, with 95 % confidence, to expand to its expected volume within 30 seconds, thus disproving the hypothesis regarding foam expansion reliability. The pre-deployment volume of <b>expanding</b> <b>foam</b> is at most 33. 6 % the pre-deployment volume of paper honeycomb; however the hypothesis regarding predeployment volume was not assessed within experimental error.

50|$|Pushing in earplugs {{into the}} {{external}} ear canal may cause the air pressure {{to rise in}} it, in effect pushing against the eardrum and causing pain. This {{may be caused by}} pressure on the ear while lying down on the side, and is also the case when completely <b>expanded</b> <b>foam</b> earplugs are pushed further into the ear. To bypass the latter risk, such earplugs are instead removed, compressed and inserted to the desired depth. Vice versa, when pulled out, the resultant negative pressure pulls the eardrum. Therefore, some earplugs are better carefully screwed or jiggled out rather than yanked out. Yawning does not help to equalize this air pressure difference, since it equalizes the pressures between the middle ear and the environment, while this overpressure rather is located in the outer ear, between the eardrum and the earplug.|$|E

50|$|Urea-formaldehyde foam {{insulation}} (UFFI) {{dates to the}} 1930s and made a synthetic insulation with R-values near 5.0 per inch. It is a foam, like shaving cream, that is easily injected or pumped into walls. It is made by using a pump set and hose with a mixing gun to mix the foaming agent, resin and compressed air. The fully <b>expanded</b> <b>foam</b> is pumped into areas in need of insulation. It becomes firm within minutes but cures within a week. UFFI is generally found in homes built before the 1970s, often in basements, crawl spaces, attics, and unfinished attics. Visually it looks like oozing liquid that has been hardened. Over time, it tends to vary in shades of butterscotch but new UFFI is a light yellow color. Early forms of UFFI tended to shrink significantly. Modern UF insulation with updated catalysts and foaming technology have reduced shrinkage to minimal levels (between 2-4%). The foam dries with a dull matte color with no shine. When cured, it often has a dry and crumbly texture.|$|E

A typical early form of this (see the Lockheed Vega) was built using molded plywood, where the layers of plywood are formed over a [...] "plug" [...] or within a mold. A later form of this structure uses fiberglass cloth impregnated with polyester or epoxy resin, instead of plywood, as the skin. A simple form of this used in some amateur-built aircraft uses rigid <b>expanded</b> <b>foam</b> plastic as the core, with a fiberglass covering, eliminating the necessity of fabricating molds, but requiring more effort in finishing (see the Rutan VariEze). An example of a larger molded plywood aircraft is the de Havilland Mosquito fighter/light bomber of World War II.No plywood-skin fuselage is truly monocoque, since stiffening elements are incorporated into the structure to carry concentrated loads that would otherwise buckle the thin skin.The use of molded fiberglass using negative ("female") molds (which give a nearly finished product) is prevalent in the series production of many modern sailplanes. The use of molded composites for fuselage structures is being extended to large passenger aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner (using pressure-molding on female molds).|$|E

40|$|An aqueous foam rising adiabatically in {{a column}} suffers a drop in temperature. Under {{appropriate}} conditions, such a column periodically explodes. We here trace this explosion to the tight thermal coupling between the foam and its enclosing glass column. When the surface surfactant concentration is unbuffered by micelles, a positive feedback exists between the flow of heat from the walls into the foam and the thermal conductivity of the foam itself. In our highly <b>expanded</b> <b>foam,</b> heat is conducted through the foam cells' interior primarily by the heat-pipe effect. Such an effect is retarded by a dense layer of surfactant molecules. Heat absorption causes cell expansion, which, in a foam unbuffered by micelles, causes a reduction in surface concentration of surfactant molecules and, hence, {{in an increase in}} thermal conductivity. This interpretation of our observed periodic explosions is in agreement with all of our observations...|$|E
40|$|A new {{generation}} of ultralight particleboards (ULPB) with an <b>expanded</b> <b>foam</b> core layer produced in an in-line foaming step is under development. The environmental impacts of three types of ULPB containing foam based on 100 % polylactic acid (PLA), 100 % expanded polystyrene, and 50 % PLA/ 50 % polymethyl methacrylate, {{as well as a}} conventional particleboard (PB), have been compared in an LCA. Two approaches were chosen for the assessment: first, the “EPD-approach” in accordance with EN 15804 for EPD of building materials and second, a holistic-approach which allows an expansion of the system boundaries in order to forecast the consequences of a broader replacement of PB with ULPB. The results show that most of the environmental impacts are related to raw materials and end-of-life stages. Both approaches show that the exchange of PB with ULPB with a foam core based on PLA leads to a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the PLA is responsible for higher ecotoxicity results in comparison to non-bio-based polymers mainly due to agricultural processes. Both approaches allowed the drafting of complementary advisories for environmental impact reduction addressed to the developers...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical study and approach for estimating associated parameters {{resulting from the}} mathematical modelling of self expanding polyurethane (PU) foams. In reaction injection molding of PU foams, the reactant polymer mixture undergoes phase transition resulting from exothermic chemical reaction, evolution of gas and network formation. Thereby, exhibiting the chemorheological property of the mixture viscosity which strongly influence the final structure of the <b>expanded</b> <b>foam.</b> More so, measuring this viscosity experimentally becomes extremely difficult, hence, the resolve to numerical investigations. However, to account for this behaviour mathematically, the foam viscosity is assumed {{to depend on the}} rate of conversion of the reactants mixture (degree of cure), temperature of the system and the volume fraction of evolving gas attributed to the chemical reaction. With this form of coupling in the state variables it becomes very challenging to estimate the associated model parameters analytically. We therefore explore a purely numerical approach in estimating some of these parameters. The coupled system of time dependent PDEs governing the foam expansion process is solved on a numerical simulation platform (CoRheoS) based on finite volume method. With graphical illustrations, we discuss the influence of these parameters on the foam viscosity and then validate our results with available experimental data...|$|E

Human exposures have been reported during manufacture as well as during use. Groups of male F 344 /N rats were administered ADA by gavage, by intratracheal instillation, and by inhalation exposure to deter-mine the disposition and modes of excretion of ADA and its metabolites. At 72 hr following gavage, 30 % of the administered ADA was absorbed whereas following intratracheal instillation, absorption was 90 %. Comparison between groups of rats exposed by inhalation to ADA to achieve body burdens of 24 or 1230 n % showed no significant differences in modes or rates of excretion of [I 4 C]ADA equivalents. ADA was readily converted to biurea under physiological conditions and biurea was the only 14 C-labeled compound present in excreta.

The material and mechanical properties of polyurethane (PUR) foam structures {{can be enhanced}} by integration of fiber reinforcement in the mold prior to the injection of the reactant (polyol and isocyanate) polymer blend. In addition, the mathematical modelling and simulation of free rise expansion process of PUR foams in simple geometries suggests that the final morphology of the <b>expanded</b> <b>foam</b> is highly influenced by the interplay between the chemorheological viscosity, temperature, gas volume fraction and degree of polymerization of the foaming mixture. However, in modelling the foam expansion process through warp-knitted spacer fabrics, one must account for the additional effects originating from the porosity and/or permeability of such layers. This additional effect generally introduces another level of difficulty in the mathematical description of such physical setup. The emerging system of nonlinear partial differential equations governing the flow is solved in appropriate geometry and boundary conditions using CoRheoS; an in-house simulation platform based on the finite volume method.
