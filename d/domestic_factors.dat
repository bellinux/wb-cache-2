40|$|This paper {{incorporates}} {{informal sector}} and efficiency wage relation in a Harris-Todaro econmy under differential production structure. The simultaneous {{existence of the}} urban informal sector and the urban unemployment has been explained interms of such efficiency wage relation. Two different production structures have been considered in this paper: first, formal capital is specific to the urban formal sector, while informal capital is mobile between the rural sector and the urban informal sector;second, formal capital is mobile between urban formal sector and the rural sector, while informal capital is specific to the urban informal sector. Our investigation shows that rural subsidization reduces unemployment and raises <b>domestic</b> <b>factor</b> income in both cases. However, such a policy may lower <b>domestic</b> <b>factor</b> income in the original models of Gupta(1997) and Grinols (1992). Subsidization to the urban formal sector raises unemployment and <b>domestic</b> <b>factor</b> income in the two different production structures. However, such a policy may produce ambiguous effect in the original model of Grinols(1991). Interestingly, subsidization to the urban informal sector leads to different effects in the two different cases. In the case of capital mobility between informal sector and rural sector, this raises unemployment and lowers <b>domestic</b> <b>factor</b> income {{and in the case}} of capital mobility between formal sector and rural sector this policy lowers unemployment and raises <b>domestic</b> <b>factor</b> income. However, such policy raises <b>domestic</b> <b>factor</b> income in the original model of Gupta (1997); and leads to ambiguous effect in the model of Grinols (1991). Thus, our results have shown that the impact of development policies on unemployment and <b>domestic</b> <b>factor</b> income depends on the nature of the production structures. These theoretical results may guide the policy makers to pursue the development policy in a small open economy. Development policy, production structure,urban unemployment...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} possible future development paths for the Swedish economy in a context where both world market conditions and <b>domestic</b> <b>factor</b> accumulation and technical change are explicitly taken into account. The main analytical tool used in the study is a general equilibrium model of the Swedish economy. World market prices and trade flows as well as <b>domestic</b> <b>factor</b> accumulation and productivity change are exogenous to the model. The sectoral allocation of capital and labor as well as domestic consumption, foreign trade, and the domestic price system are endogenously determined variables. The study's projections indicate that Sweden is entering a period with considerably slower economic growth than during the earlier part of the postwar period. Underlying this result is an assumed slowdown of the rate of productivity growth. The assumed rates of productivity change do not differ significantly between the sectors. Consequently reallocation gains can be achieved only through a reduction of the intersectoral differences in the marginal productivity of capital, characterizing the initial year of the project period...|$|R

40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{specific features}} of formation {{and development of}} the <b>domestic</b> <b>factoring</b> market. In the result of the study the article establishes that development of factoring in Ukraine took place due to active participation of banking institutions in this process and nowadays they are leaders in the <b>domestic</b> <b>factoring</b> services market due to possessing significant competitive advantages if compared with non-banking companies that specialise in factoring. The article detects that nowadays the banks are not only offerers of factoring services and finance factoring operations of other market participants, but also take an active part in establishment of factoring branches and are consumers of factoring services. In order to accelerate development of international factoring in Ukraine, the article offers such forms of state support of banks, which render <b>factoring</b> services to <b>domestic</b> exporters. The article recommends to focus banks’ attention, under modern conditions that are characterised with volatility of financial markets, on factoring servicing of those clients, whom they have long business relations with, without jeopardising themselves through provision of factoring services to a big number of small debtors.

50|$|This {{period of}} Scottish history also marked the {{profound}} {{growth of the}} money supply within Scotland.

The increase in available capital helped fuel commercial development, especially in Scotland and England, which gained directly from the mines in the Pennines. However, even when the mines were exhausted of silver, the current account surplus enabled the money supply to continue growing. “During the thirteenth century, a positive and reciprocal relationship therefore existed between the growth of overseas trade, expansion of the money supplies, and advance of commercialization,” describes economic historian Bruce Campbell.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} focus on the role of FDIs for the growth and {{development}} process. We introduce a simple model of endogenous growth and development which captures a con-vergence as well as a divergence regime. Successful catching–up requires the closing of the technological gap towards the leading countries of the industrialized world. As the country is backward the knowledge and technology acquiring sector is described by a process of im-itation. Foreign direct investments, human capital, and technological spill over e¤ects are important factors for the production of the …nal good {{as well as for the}} imitation of tech-nologies. It is shown that the economy will face a divergence regime as long as the <b>domestic</b> <b>factor,</b> human capital endowment, is below a critical level. Although FDIs are important for the process of technological catching–up, the switching condition for upgrading as well as the …nal level of the technological position is solely determined by the stock of domes-tic resources. Without a su¢cient <b>domestic</b> <b>factor,</b> no take-o ¤ to a dynamic catching-up process takes place. Therefore, the results emphasize the importance of domestic resources. The role of FDIs as a sole source of foreign technologies may be overestimated, especially with respect to the question of convergence or divergence. Having reached a critical leve...|$|R
