25|$|Since the {{abolition}} of democratic government in America in 2070, Mega-City One has been a dictatorship run by the Justice Department. It subsequently became an independent city-state following the break-up of the United States and had already been granted autonomy within the Union in 2052. Its ruler is the Chief Judge, in current stories (as of January 2017) Chief Judge Barbara Hershey. She is accountable to a council of five senior judges. The citizens are permitted to have an elected city council and mayor, but with no significant power: {{the idea is that}} a facade of <b>democracy</b> <b>will</b> placate most people.|$|E
25|$|Reports were {{released}} that Antonis Samaras, {{the leader of}} New <b>Democracy,</b> <b>will</b> be summoned to the Hague trial issued by Skopje on Greece for breaking the 1995 Interim Agreement, after evidence was found of him addressing the Greek parliament and clearly stating that his Government (New Democracy then in power) vetoed the invitation of the Republic of Macedonia at the 2008 Bucharest NATO summit. Also in this year the dispute was inflamed by the erection of a statue in Skopje of a mounted warrior which copies a portrait of Alexander the Great attributed to the ancient Greek sculptor Lysippus, and the inauguration of a sports stadium named after Alexander's father Philip II. In his farewell speech to the Parliament, the outgoing prime minister George Papandreou listed the immediate settlement of the name issue {{as one of the}} 3 priorities of the next government.|$|E

500|$|In 1961 Bessie's {{aldermanic}} term on Liverpool's council expired. That year, the Conservatives briefly {{took control}} of the council, and used their majority to block her reappointment. This ended 31 years' service on the council. In 1963, when Labour regained control, she did not seek re-instatement. The year 1963 saw the publication of The Braddocks, [...] in which Bessie made a sustained attack on communism and Trotskyism: [...] "The purpose of this book is to bring home to the rank and file how wide that influence is... unless positive steps are taken by the workers themselves... <b>democracy</b> <b>will</b> be dead". Reviewing the book for the Socialist Standard, Lawrence Weidberg thought it gave a useful picture of early 20th century working-class life in Liverpool, but concluded that [...] "from the evidence of this book the Braddocks qualified fully for the role of blind leaders of the blind".|$|E

While direct military rule has become rare in Asia, military forces continue to impose limits on the scope of democratization efforts in many countries. This paper argues that civilian control exists when government officials hold ultimate jurisdiction over military activities, and that control is maximized when soldiers are confined to tasks linked to their primary function: preparing for war. Civilian control is likely to emerge only when rulers gain sufficient leverage over the armed forces to compel military officers to accept oversight.

You can take a vote among Jews and Christians and Moslems about whether lamp-posts should be painted green or portraits of politicians painted at all, and even their solid unanimity may be solid indifference. Most of what is called self-determination is like that; but there is no self-determination about it. The people are not determined. You cannot take a vote when the people are determined. You accept a vote, or something very much more obvious than a vote.|$|E

He put forth a cyclical theory of government where monarchies tend to decay into aristocracies, which then decay into democracies, which subsequently decay into anarchy, then tyranny, then return to monarchy.

But he wisely fears no change of Government from any, but the Papists. Now I am of a better heart, for I fear it neither from Papists nor Presbyterians.

6000|$|<b>Democracy</b> <b>will</b> {{be against}} science, we admit, in one contingency: if it loses {{the battle with}} the Ultramontane Church. The worst enemy of science is also the bitterest enemy of democracy, c'est le cléricalisme. The {{interests}} of science {{and the interests of}} democracy are one. Let us take a case. Suppose that popular Government in France were to succumb, a military or any other more popular Government would be forced to lean on Ultramontanes. Ultramontanes would gather the spoils of democratic defeat. Sir Henry Maine is much too well informed to think that a clerical triumph would be good for science, whatever else it might be good for. Then are not propositions about democracy being against science very idle and a little untrue? [...] "Modern politics," [...] said a wise man (Pattison, Sermons, p. 191) [...] "resolve themselves into the struggle between knowledge and tradition." [...] Democracy is hardly on the side of tradition.|$|E

Who, indeed, in these degenerate days would hesitate between an ode and an omelette, a sonnet and a salmis? Yet the position is not entirely Philistine; cookery is an art; are not its principles the subject of South Kensington lectures, and does not the Royal Academy give a banquet once a year? Besides, as the coming <b>democracy</b> <b>will,</b> no doubt, insist on feeding us all on penny dinners, it is well that the laws of cookery should be explained: for were the national meal burned, or badly seasoned, or served up with the wrong sauce a dreadful revolution might follow.|$|E

The answer is simple and concise, and acts as a background to all political studies that have dealt with the problem: the ideal, says Sartori (1993 : 54) “remains a parameter that is expected to measure and press the real forward ‘towards the best’”. 5 Namely, according to Lijphart (1984 : 2): “[…] the end of a scale on which the degree of democratic responsiveness of different regimes may be measured”.|$|R
