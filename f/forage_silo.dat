The feeding system of Holstein-Frisian cattle, applied in the Dambovita farms it’s a model can be extended and applied in all the cattle farms, in the same climate and soil conditions, even if the farm dimensions and working organization are different. At the studied farms the cattle don’t paste; the arable land it’s used for perennial and annual fodder culture, that assure the necessary in green forage during the summer and raw material for fibroses and silo-forage preparing. At these farms it isn’t a practice to feed the cattle only with green fodder in the summer period (for milk production) but with a balanced quantity of dry substances represented by fibrouses, industrial succulent and wet corn, near by green fodder. One of the reason that assure a big quantity of milk of Holstein-Frisian cattle it is represented by different feeding, depending on milk quantity and physical estate of each cow. An essential condition for a profitable activity of cattle farms is the presence of arable land to assure, at least, the production of base forage, respectively green and succulent <b>forage,</b> <b>silo</b> corn and hay; without this surfaces can’t speak about efficient breeding of cattle in a farm or agricultural exploitation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Forage</b> {{conservation}} in <b>silos</b> {{depends on the}} efficiency of silo sealing, among other factors, to minimize aerobic deterioration and consequent qualitative and quantitative losses in silage. Thus, {{the aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the effect of two sealing types on dry matter recovery rate, aerobic stability, nutritional composition, and in vitro digestibility of corn silage in bunker silos: 110 -µm-thick double-sided polyethylene sealing (conventional sealing) and 110 -µm-thick double-sided polyethylene sealing superimposed on 111 -µm-thick translucent polyethylene sealing (double sealing). There were no significant differences in nutritional composition of silages between conventional and double sealing. However, the double sealing system was more efficient (P< 0. 05) in maintaining lower silo temperatures (30. 48 °C vs. 31. 18 °C), in dry matter recovery (88. 79 % vs. 85. 64 %), and increased in vitro neutral-detergent fiber digestibility (33. 04 % vs. 24. 6 %), when compared to the conventional version...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal was}} to {{evaluate}} the chemical composition and fermentation pattern of elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum. cv. Roxo) silage with different levels of soybean hulls or rice bran. Two trials were conducted, comprising of a completely randomized design, with four replicates each. Treatments consisted on the addition of 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % of soybean hulls or rice bran to unwilted green elephant grass <b>forage.</b> Large PVC <b>silos</b> were used adopting a density of 600 kg of green mass m- 3. The silos were opened 40 days after ensiling. The results revealed that the inclusion of 10 % soybean hulls increased elephant grass forage dry matter (DM) content to 31 %, but did not alter the water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content or buffering capacity. The resultant silages exhibited good fermentation patterns in terms of pH (less than 3. 97) and NH 3 -N (4. 07 % total N) levels. The inclusion of rice bran increased both DM and WSC content in the forage, improving the fermentation pattern of silages (P < 0. 05). This too was verified by a pH lower than 3. 92 and a maximum NH 3 -N of 4. 23 % of the total N. The inclusion of 10 % rice bran to the elephant grass improved the nutritional value of the forage to be ensiled and, hence, of the produced silage...|$|R
40|$|Corn was inoculated with Lactobacillus plantarum and Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii either {{independently}} or as {{a mixture}} at ensiling, {{in order to}} determine the effect of bacterial additives on corn silage quality. Grain corn was harvested at 32 – 37 % of dry matter and ensiled in a 4 [*]L laboratory <b>silo.</b> <b>Forage</b> was treated as follows: bacterial types: B 0 (without bacteria-control), B 1 (L. plantarum), B 2 (P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii), and B 3 (combination of L. plantarum and P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii). Each 2 [*]kg of chopped forage was treated with 10 [*]mL of bacterial culture and allowed to ferment for 27 days. The first experiment determined the most suitable wavelength for detection of bacteria (490 [*]nm and 419 [*]nm for B 1 and B 2, resp.) and the preferable inoculation size (1 × 105 [*]cfu/g). The second experiment analysed the effect of B 1 and B 2 applied singly or as a mixture on the fermentation characteristics and quality of corn silage. L. plantarum alone increased crude protein (CP) and reduced pH rapidly. In a mixture with P. freudenreichii, the final pH was the lowest compared to other treatments. As a mixture, inclusion of bacteria resulted in silage with lower digestibility than control. Corn silage treated with L. plantarum or P. freudenreichii either alone or mixed together produced desirable silage properties; however, this was not significantly better than untreated silage...|$|R
