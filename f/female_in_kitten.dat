40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the changes in selected hematology and serum biochemistry of Angora cats (Felis catus) during growth period.

40|$|The {{development}} of cortico-cortical connections was studied <b>in</b> <b>kittens</b> deprived of vision by binocular eyelid suture during {{the formation of}} axonal arbors and synaptogenesis, i. e. between the second postnatal week {{and the end of}} the third postnatal month. Axons originating in area 17 and terminating either in ipsilateral or contralateral visual areas were visualized with biocytin. In ipsilateral areas 17 and 18, distinct clusters of branches begin to form, distally from the injection, during the second half of the first postnatal month, independently of pattern vision. More proximal clusters differentiate during the second postnatal month, and this seems to involve elimination of exuberant axonal branches. <b>In</b> <b>kittens</b> deprived of vision for 3 or more months, beginning before natural eye opening, the distal clusters regress and the proximal ones fail to differentiate. In extrastriate areas, distinct clusters of branches have segregated by the end of the second postnatal month, independently of visual experience; however, <b>in</b> <b>kittens</b> deprived of vision for 2 or more months, one of the clusters was selectively eliminated. In contralateral areas 17 and 18, we found stunted terminal arbors <b>in</b> <b>kittens</b> continuously deprived of vision. This was already noticeable at the end of the first postnatal month. Apparently, in the absence of pattern vision, most axons undergo only limited growth and do not form their characteristic terminal columns. Many of these axons are subsequently eliminated. In contrast, 8 days of vision beginning at natural eye opening and followed by visual deprivation caused a nearly normal {{development of}} intrahemispheric and interhemispheric connections. In conclusion, pattern vision appears to validate connections at early stages of their development; this validation is necessary for their further growth and differentiation that can then continue autonomously...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{mammalian}} brain remains {{capable of}} adapting {{to changes in}} the sensory input throughout the entire animal's life, there is a marked difference in this capability between young and adult animals. Young cats within a critical period respond to these input changes by modifying their cortical connections, while in adult animals this cortical plasticity is greatly reduced. The molecular basis of this age-dependent difference in modifiability of the visual cortex between kittens and adult cats is, until now, not known in great detail. In an attempt to unravel the proteins involved in this age-dependent cortical plasticity, we compared the protein expression levels of visual area 17 of 30 -day old kittens and adult cats, using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2 D-DIGE), combining a recently developed fluorescent pre-labeling technique for the quantitative analysis of proteins on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, with mass spectrometry for protein identification. This let us to identify 32 proteins showing differential expression levels, of which 18 were more abundantly expressed <b>in</b> <b>kitten</b> striate cortex and 14 were more abundant in adult cats. Next to a number of metabolic enzymes, we isolated several proteins related to axon growth and growth cone guidance (collapsin response mediator proteins) and to the formation of new cytoskeletal filaments (cofilin, T-complex proteins 1 alpha and zeta) <b>in</b> <b>kittens,</b> probably making the rapid outgrowth of new connections possible after sensory changes.

40|$|The recent {{introduction}} of fluorescent two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis, combined with mass spectrometry, has greatly simplified {{the analysis and}} identification of differentially expressed proteins by eliminating intergel variability. In this report, we describe the successful application of this functional proteomics approach to compare protein expression levels in visual cortical area 17 of adult cats and 30 -day-old <b>kittens,</b> <b>in</b> order to identify proteins expressed in an age-related fashion.

40|$|The sneeze reflex is a {{valuable}} tool for exploring the maturation of the respiratory control in the newborn as it alters both inspiratory and expiratory activities. Air puff stimulation of the superior nasal meatus innervated by ethmoidal afferents consistently evokes sneeze in adult cats. Such stimulation evokes only a reinforcement of expiratory activities <b>in</b> newborn <b>kittens.</b> This study demonstrates that the pattern of Fos-like immunoreactivity evoked by nasal stimulation changes during functional maturation of sneeze. Nasal stimulation evoked immunoreactivity (i) in the trigeminal sensory complex, at the levels where nasal afferents project, (ii) in the reticular formation, (iii) in the solitary complex and (iv) in the parabrachial area of mature kittens.

40|$|Abstract: Movement {{pattern of}} the Iriomote cat Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis was studied on Iriomote Island, Japan by radio-tracking. The {{influence}} of sex and reproductive status of cats on their daily movement distance (DMD), straight-line distance (SLD), daily movement range (DMR) and other relative indices of movements was estimated. DMD was longest in males (3. 2 km) and shortest <b>in</b> <b>females</b> without <b>kittens</b> (1. 9 km). Also, males moved faster than either females with or without kittens (0. 34, 0. 25 and 0. 25 km/h, respectively). During the mating season, males moved faster and their DMRs were larger than {{during the rest of}} the year. The SLD/DMD ratio in males was similarly high in both seasons (0. 29 and 0. 33), which indicates that their daily routes were expanded over large areas year-round, possibly to maintain a continuous control over their home range. In contrast, SLD/DMD varied seasonally <b>in</b> breeding <b>females.</b> It was low (0. 09) during the lactating period, when females returned repeatedly to the den with kittens and it became high (0. 32) out of the breeding season. Breeding females moved equally long DMDs in both seasons, whereas non-breeding ones moved shorter distances during the breeding period. These differences may be related to seasonal changes of food abundance. Cats moved intensively, as indicated by long (812 - 1139 m) routes per km 2 of their home range, an...|$|R

Responses to visual stimuli were analyzed to determine the relationship between two related facets of the behaviors of the cells: direction selectivity (DS) and timing.

40|$|OVERVIEW: Feline {{panleukopenia}} virus (FPV) infects all felids {{as well as}} raccoons, mink and foxes. This pathogen may {{survive in}} the environment for several months and is highly resistant to some disinfectants. INFECTION: Transmission occurs via the faecal-oral route. Indirect contact {{is the most common}} route of infection, and FPV may be carried by fomites (shoes, clothing), which means indoor cats are also at risk. Intrauterine virus transmission and infection of neonates can occur. DISEASE SIGNS: Cats of all ages may be affected by FPV, but kittens are most susceptible. Mortality rates are high - over 90 % <b>in</b> <b>kittens.</b> Signs of disease include diarrhoea, lymphopenia and neutropenia, followed by thrombocytopenia and anaemia, immunosuppression (transient in adult cats), cerebellar ataxia (<b>in</b> <b>kittens</b> only) and abortion. DIAGNOSIS: Feline panleukopenia virus antigen is detected in faeces using commercially available test kits. Specialised laboratories carry out PCR testing on whole blood or faeces. Serological tests are not recommended, as they do not distinguish between infection and vaccination. DISEASE MANAGEMENT: Supportive therapy and good nursing significantly decrease mortality rates. In cases of enteritis, parenteral administration of a broad-spectrum antibiotic is recommended. Disinfectants containing sodium hypochlorite (bleach), peracetic acid, formaldehyde or sodium hydroxide are effective. VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS: All cats - including indoor cats - should be vaccinated. Two injections, at 8 - 9 weeks of age and 3 - 4 weeks later, are recommended, and a first booster 1 year later. A third vaccination at 16 - 20 weeks of age is recommended for kittens from environments with a high infection pressure (cat shelters) or from queens with high vaccine-induced antibody levels (breeding catteries). Subsequent booster vaccinations should be administered at intervals of 3 years or more. Modified-live virus vaccines should not be used in pregnant queens or <b>in</b> <b>kittens</b> less than 4 weeks of age...|$|R
