5|$|E. c. albipennis was {{described}} by John Gould in 1841 and found in north Queensland, west though the Gulf of Carpentaria in the Northern Territory and across <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> Western Australia. It has white on the wings and a discontinuous stripe on the nape. The wing patch is pure white {{in the western part}} of its range and is more cream towards the east. It has a longer bill and shorter tail than the nominate race. Birds also decrease in size with decreasing latitude, consistent with Bergmann's rule. Molecular work supports the current classification of this subspecies as distinct from the nominate subspecies cyanotis.|$|E
5|$|He {{had shot}} June in her bed, but {{she managed to}} get up and walk a few steps before {{collapsing}} and dying. He had shot Nevill in the bedroom too, but Nevill was able to get downstairs where he and Bamber fought in the kitchen, before Bamber shot him four times, twice in his temple and twice <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> his head. He had shot Sheila in the main bedroom, next to her mother, and had shot the children in their beds as they slept.|$|E
5|$|The {{conformational}} {{mobility of}} serpins provides a key advantage over static lock-and-key protease inhibitors. In particular, {{the function of}} inhibitory serpins can be regulated by allosteric interactions with specific cofactors. The X-ray crystal structures of antithrombin, heparin cofactor II, MENT and murine antichymotrypsin reveal that these serpins adopt a conformation wherein the first two amino acids of the RCL are inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the A β-sheet. The partially inserted conformation is important because co-factors are able to conformationally switch certain partially inserted serpins into a fully expelled form. This conformational rearrangement makes the serpin a more effective inhibitor.|$|E

5|$|The {{telescope}} was constructed {{so that the}} bowl could be completely inverted. Originally, {{it was intended to}} use a movable tower {{at the base of the}} telescope to change the receivers at the focus. However, the movable tower was never built, due jointly to funding constraints and the fact that much of the receiver equipment was placed at the base of the telescope rather than at the focus. Instead, receivers were mounted on 50-foot (15-m) long steel tubes, which were then inserted by a winch <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the aerial tower while the bowl was inverted. The cables from the receivers then ran down the inside of this tube, which could then be connected when the {{telescope was}} pointed at the zenith. Associated receiver equipment could then be placed either in the small, swinging laboratory directly underneath the surface; in rooms at the tops of the two towers; at the base girders, or in the control building.|$|E
5|$|Midfielder Michael Collins joined on a one-month {{loan from}} Oxford, as {{cover for the}} injured Nolan and Summerfield. Michael Coulson scored with a low shot to give York a 50th-minute lead at home to Cambridge United, and John McCombe scored four minutes later with a curling shot to make the score 2–0. However, Mark Roberts and Barry Corr scored for Cambridge in the last 19 minutes, and the match {{finished}} a 2–2 draw. York knocked League One team Doncaster Rovers out of the Football League Trophy {{in the second round}} with a 2–0 home win. Oliver gave York an early lead with a header into the bottom corner from an Anthony Straker cross, and he doubled the lead early into the second half; after dispossessing Aaron Taylor-Sinclair he lifted the ball over the advancing goalkeeper, Thorsten Stuckmann, before hitting the ball into an empty net. York ended Luton Town's four-match winning streak with a 1–1 away draw; Lowe scored late into the first half with a shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the goal, before Luton equalised in the second half from a Cameron McGeehan penalty. Turner's loan was extended for a second month. York were beaten 3–1 away by Barnet, who had been on a three-match losing streak. After going behind to John Akinde's goal, Coulson equalised for York in the 80th minute with a drilled shot, but goals in the last 10 minutes from Michael Gash and Josh Clarke secured a win for the home team.|$|E
5|$|Porte {{kept the}} pink jersey for two days, conceding it to David Arroyo, a fellow {{member of the}} L'Aquila breakaway, on stage 14 when he could not climb Monte Grappa with the leaders on the day. On this stage, the race's overall {{favorites}} began to creep back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the overall classification, as previous race leaders Nibali, Vinokourov, and Evans assumed 8th through 10th in the standings. There were again great changes to the overall classification in stage 15, {{by way of the}} climb up Monte Zoncolan. Ivan Basso won the stage and greatly reduced his deficit to Arroyo, though the Spaniard still held the pink jersey after this stage. Evans, Scarponi, Vinokourov, and Nibali also finished well-placed and moved up. Wiggins again fell out of contention, this time conclusively so, by losing 25 minutes on the climb. Evans turned in the best ride of the pre-race favorites in the Plan de Corones time trial, closing his deficit to Basso and moving past Sastre in the overall. After this stage, the only riders left in the top ten from the L'Aquila breakaway were Arroyo, Porte, Sastre, and Robert Kišerlovski, who all finished the Giro in the top ten.|$|E

5|$|The Type 26 {{revolver}} is 231mm (9.09in) {{in length}} and 130mm (5.12in) tall, weighing 880 g (1lb 15oz) unloaded. It has an octagonal barrel, with the foresight blade being embedded directly into the barrel. The rear sight is incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the frame. A hinged sideplate allows access to the mechanism for lubricating and servicing. The weapon was opened by lifting the top latch, after which the barrel was swung downward, activating the automatic ejector. The notch that allows access to the cylinder {{is at the top}} rear of the frame. The revolver is double-action only because of the absence of a cocking spur, intended to avoid snagging on clothing and firing accidentally. The lock was self-cocking and was slow to respond. The delay in response made accurate shooting virtually impossible. The cylinder contains a serious design flaw, with it only notching while the hammer is cocked. This allows the cylinder to revolve by being brushed against an object or the inertia from a sudden sideways motion. As the cylinder can move freely, an empty or already fired chamber can rotate into position instead of the next shot, a dangerous event for the user during combat. Later Type 26 Revolvers have grips with lateral serrations in place of an earlier knurled pattern as well as differences in external finish, depth, and look of die stamped markings. The bluing of the steel is excellent, even though the steel used is soft compared to Western standards. The 9mm Japanese revolver ammunition used by the Type 26 is unique to the weapon. Both the Type 26 Revolver and the ammunition used was later replaced by semi-automatic pistols such as the Nambu {{in the beginning of the}} 20th century.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the other}} three designs, the R.90 was a biplane.

Two floats were fitted. The proposed armament was four 7.5mm machine guns, two in the lower wing and two in the floats.|$|E
