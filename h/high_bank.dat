25|$|Later, {{during a}} search in AO Wondai on the {{afternoon}} of 14 February, C Company 9 RAR contacted a strong Viet Cong force in a large bunker system. Despite being supported by a helicopter light fire team and artillery the Australians were unable to advance, and they subsequently broke contact in order to allow the use of medium artillery after having lost one killed and four wounded. The following day A Company was deployed with tanks to assist a further assault by C Company in the bunker system, which was again found to have been abandoned by the Viet Cong after having suffered a number of casualties. Meanwhile, a series of minor contacts occurred as communist forces began returning to the area. In AO Tiki, D Company 4 RAR/NZ mounted a series of ambushes on the creeks which flowed into the Rung Sat. The Viet Cong had been using these watercourses extensively for logistic resupply and {{to gain access to the}} villages in the area. On 15 February 10 Platoon D Company had deployed to southern end of the battalion AO in order to mount a night ambush on a <b>high</b> <b>bank</b> on a sharp bend in the Suoi Cau river. The infantry were reinforced by 90mm M67 recoilless rifles (RCLs) from the Tracker Platoon, which were placed on the flanks. At 21:03 six sampans carrying around 15 Viet Cong entered the engagement area moving from west to east and the ambush was initiated by splintex rounds from the RCLs as well as M60 machine-guns and small arms. At least two sampans were sunk and six Viet Cong killed before they were able to withdraw to the southern bank and engage the Australians with small arms and RPGs. At first light the next morning the Australians swept the area, wading through the shallow river at low tide, subsequently locating another damaged sampan, an AK-47, an RPG-2 and two RPG rounds.|$|E
