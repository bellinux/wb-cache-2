Michael Faraday described his laws of electrolysis in 1833, relating {{for the first time}} the amount of electrical charge and converted mass. In 1886 Charles Martin Hall developed a cheap electrochemical process for the extraction of aluminium from its ore in molten salts, constituting the first true large-scale electrochemical industry. Later, Hamilton Castner improved the process aluminium manufacturing and devised the electrolysis of brine in large mercury cells for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, effectively founding the chlor-alkali industry with Karl Kellner in 1892. The next year, Paul L. Hulin patented <b>filter-press</b> type electrochemical cells in France. Charles Frederick Burgess developed the electrolytic refining of iron ca. 1904 and later run a successful battery company. Burgess published one of the first texts on the field in 1920. During the first three decades of the 20th century, industrial electrochemistry followed an empirical approach.|$|E

HISTORY The peeling of pyroxylin or other films from the surfaces of petri-factions has long {{been used in the}} microscopical study of fossil plants. The history of the technique was summarized by Appel (1933). The technique was applied to soft ores by Appel (op. cit.) and to clays by Weatherhead (1940). Weatherhead noticed that detrital quartz-grains remained included in his micro-preparations, and this obser-vation led Williamson (1941) to use a comparable method for eluci-dating the effects of processing-operations (<b>filter-pressing,</b> casting, extrusion, mechanical spreading, etc.) on the arrangement of the non-plastic particles in electrical porcelain and other ceramic "bodies. " These particles had been comminuted by ball-mills and other devices, and most of them were quartz or calcined flint as flattened chips and feldspar as cleavage-fragments. Because of their tendency to flatness they developed epositional or flow planar parallelisms in response to processing-operations, e. g., to <b>filter-pressing</b> or extrusion re-spectively. They were oriented within clay-aggregates where the basal planes of the clay-minerals were in some accord with the major surfaces of the included particles; thus a general planar parallelism tended to appear throughout the composite mass (Williamson, 1947...|$|R

These are formed of three main, genetically related units: picrite, picrodolerite and crinanite, which {{are the result of}} differentiation of an alkali-olivine basalt magma (approximately 10 % MgO) in an upper-crustal magma chamber. Variations in igneous stratigraphy and the presence of internal chills in the Trotternish sills suggest that they were emplaced by multiple intrusion and subsequently differentiated in situ.

Rhythmic layering (1 cm to 1 m thick) is conspicuous in the sills near contacts but does not involve cryptic mineral variation.

In all cases, we obtained set cements composed mainly of biomimetic carbonated apatite analogous to bone mineral. With this study,we evidenced a synergistic effect of the L/P ratio and SF presence on the injectability (i. e., the <b>filter-pressing</b> phenomenon was suppressed) and the setting time of the SF-loaded cement paste compared to reference cement(without SF). In addition, the in vitro study of SF release, according to the European Pharmacopoeia recommendations, showed that, regardless of the L/P ratio, the cement allowed a sustained release of the antibiotic over 1 month in sodiumchloride isotonic solution at 37 °C and pH 7. 4; this release is discussed considering the microstructure characteristics of SF-loaded cements (i. e., porosity, pore-size distribution) before and after the release test.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we aim to}} {{evaluate}} {{the contribution of the}} co-grinding process in controlling calcium carbonate-dicalcium phosphate dihydrate cement properties. We set a method designed to evaluate phase separation, usually occurring during paste extrusion, which is quantitative, reliable, and discriminating and points out the determining role of cogrinding to limit <b>filter-pressing.</b> We show that solid phase co-grinding leads to synergistic positive effects on cement injectability, mechanical properties, and radio-opacity. It allows maintaining a low (< 0. 4 kg) and constant load during the extrusion of paste, and the paste’s composition remains constant and close to that of the initial paste. Analogous behavior was observed when adding a third component into the solid phase, especially SrCO 3 as a contrasting agent. Moreover, the cement’s mechanical properties can be enhanced by lowering the L/S ratio because of the lower plastic limit. Finally, unloaded or Sr-loaded cements show uniform and increased optical density because of the enhanced homogeneity of dry component distribution. Interestingly, this study reveals that cogrinding improves and controls essential cement properties and involves processing parameters that could be easily scaled up. This constitutes a decisive advantage for the development of calcium carbonate-calcium phosphate mixed cements and, more generally, of injectable multicomponent bone cements that meet a surgeon’s requirements...|$|R

40|$|Fine-grained anorthositic dikes are {{associated}} with a massive leuconorite pluton (CI = 15) which is exposed over an area of about 200 km 2. Internally, the pluton shows little compositional variation; average plagioclase composition ranges from An 32 to An 48. The dikes are nearly uniform in composition and similar to the estimated bulk composition of the pluton (55 per cent SiO 2). They therefore appear to represent the parental magma of the leuconorite pluton. A small body of granite (10 km 2) was emplaced within and prior to the complete solidification of the leuconorite. The granitic intrusion caused local deformation of the leuconorite and <b>filter-pressing</b> of its late stage interstitial liquids. These liquids occur in the younger hydrous granite as very fine-grained, chilled pillows of nearly anhydrous Fe-rich diorite and granite. Most of the pillows are diorites with approximately 55 per cent SiO 2. On oxide plots these lie approximately on a plagioclase control line passing through the composition of the leuconorite dikes. The entire group of chilled pillows ranges in composition from 45 to 71 per cent SiO 2 with a gap between 57 and 63 per cent SiO 2. On oxide plots they produce a smooth trend which is oblique to and truncates the plagioclase control line. Variation in the pillows can best be explained by late-stage liquid immiscibility. Fractionation in the interstitial magma was controlled early by crystallization of plagioclase and later by plagioclase plus pyroxene. Very late stage differentiation was controlled mainly by liquid immiscibility and produced FeO- and SiO 2 -rich liquids...|$|R
40|$|The Kameni Islands {{have been}} the focus of {{historic}} volcanic activity on Santorini, Greece. The islands comprise a series of dacite lavas, the erupted compositions of which have remained approximately constant for the last ∼ 2200 years. The dacite lava flows of Nea Kameni contain a variety of mafic enclaves, distinguished by differences in texture, composition and mechanical behaviour. The mafic enclaves represent chilled fragments of mafic magma that crystallised rapidly on contact with the cooler, more silicic host magma. The absence of chilled margins on the enclaves suggests that the replenishing magma initially formed a dense layer {{at the base of the}} chamber. Groundmass textures are interpreted as an indication of the degree of undercooling between the enclaves and the host. Groundmass textural information obtained from the enclaves has been used to determine the relative volumes of replenishing magmas injected into the host magma before eruption, which indicates that the volume of erupted magma is directly proportional to the volume of replenishing magma emplaced in the chamber prior to eruption, which thus may act as a potential eruption trigger. The variety of replenishing magmas implies the existence of a complex conduit and chamber system beneath Santorini volcano. Andesitic enclaves with linear crystal size distributions are thought to have originated as an aphyric andesitic melt expelled from a crystal mush by <b>filter-pressing.</b> Disequilibrium phenocryst assemblages in the lavas and phenocryst-bearing enclaves provide evidence for the entrainment and recycling of older phenocryst populations. © 2006 Elsevier B.

To test whether syn-magmatic deformation was essential to enhance {{the efficiency of the}} process, we studied the Main Series of Stepninsk, a pluton emplaced into an active crustal-scale strike-slip shear zone. The Main Series (N 95 vol. % of total granitoids) is high-K calc-alkaline, comprises rocks with SiO 2 from 51 to 77 wt. %, and stands out because most major and many trace elements yield excellent linear or curvilinear correlations with silica. It includes deformed gabbrodiorites to monzogranites, and undeformed syenogranites to alaskites. Deformed and undeformed rocks are coeval (283 F 2 Ma). All rocks, irrespective of their silica content, have the same initial Sr and Nd isotope ratios (87 Sr / 86 Sr 283 Ma= 0. 70488 F 0. 000131; e(Nd) 283 Ma = 0. 79 F 0. 49), and contain amphibole and biotite with the same compositions. Based on thermodynamic and trace-element fractionation simulations, we propose a model of deformation-driven <b>filter-pressing</b> differentiation consistent with these features. The Main Series is derived from a hydrous high-K granodioritic magma which intruded containing ~ 0. 3 of earlyformed solids. These accumulated locally by flow differentiation to produce the gabbrodiorites. The crystallization continued until the fraction of solids was higher than ~ 0. 55, after which different magma batches were efficiently squeezed by differential stress coupled with the opening of tensile fractures in the shear zone.

Although {{the large number of}} processes involved in the crystal-melt separation (i. e. crystal settling, compaction, <b>filter-press),</b> the efficacy of each process in generating consistent volumes of aphyric eruptible magmas is poorly known. Seeking for an answer, we have experimentally investigated crystallization in presence of a thermal gradient as a possible mechanism for crystal-melt separation, considering both chemical and physical effects acting on a variably crystallized system. Our case study is the phonolitic volcanism of Sabatini Volcanic District (SVD), Central Italy. We used a natural tephri-phonolitic composition as starting material, using a thermal gradient-driven crystallization in order to simulate the crystallization process of a thermally zoned magma chamber. Crystallization degree and melt composition vary along the thermal gradient. In particular, melt composition ranges from the tephri-phonolitic starting composition {{at the bottom of the}} charge (hottest and aphyric zone) to phonolitic at the top (cooler and heterogeneously-crystallised zone), reproducing the same liquid line of descent observed in phase equilibria experiments. Backscattered images of experimental products clearly evidence: i) the aphyric tephri-phonolitic melt region at the bottom of the charge; ii) a drop-shaped crystal clustering in the middle zone; and iii) large aphyric belt and pockets (up to 100 µm wide) of phonolitic melt, with large deformed-shaped sanidine occurring at their margin, at the charge top region. Intriguingly, these batches of aphyric phonolitic melt, are separated from the highly crystallized zone by a thick mush of crystals (Cpx+Pl). A mere settling process cannot explain the upward accumulation of the aphyric phonolitic melt, while the high viscosity of the crystalline region would limit the efficacy of compaction and <b>filter-press</b> mechanisms.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the comenditic {{trachyte}} enclaves hosted in pantelleritic lava and pumices emplaced {{during one of the}} most recent eruptive events at Pantelleria (~ 6 ka). Enclaves range from mm-sized fragments to dm-sized blocks with spheroidal to amoeboid shapes and characteristic globular surfaces; they are crystal-rich with ~ 30 vol% large anorthoclase, less abundant Fe-rich olivine, clinopyroxene and Fe–Ti oxides. Vesicles ranging from a fewmmto 1 – 2 cm in size are distributed throughout the enclave and are commonly filledwith microlitefree vesicular glass. The groundmass presents spectacular textures, including fine to coarse spherulites and hopper and skeletal microlites (mostly anorthoclase) with 10 – 35 vol% residual glass and 10 – 15 vol% small vesicles (b 50 μm to 200 μm). Residual glass has a pantelleritic composition with Na + K/Al N 2. Accordingly, the microlite composition is close to that of the host pantellerite. These textures were acquired during a magma mixing event prior to the eruption: (i) a vapor-saturated comenditic trachyte magma intruded the shallower, cooler pantellerite magma body, triggering a first degassing event (first boiling) and rapid crystallization {{with a high degree of}} undercooling (ΔT = 100 – 150 °C); (ii) vapor exsolution induced by rapid crystallization (second boiling) produced the microvesicular groundmass; and (iii) vapor pressure forced the residual pantelleritic liquid to migrate into the large vesicles and/or outside the enclaves. Based on this interpretation, these enclaves can be used as a natural laboratory for identifying the chemical and physical processes driving the evolution of silicic magmas at Pantelleria. In particular, they can be used to assess whether pantellerite melts can be obtained from comenditic trachytes after extensive crystallization followed by gas-driven <b>filter-pressing</b> and consequent (pantellerite) melt segregation...|$|R
40|$|Magmatic rocks {{containing}} economic {{concentrations of}} iron, titanium, vanadium and phosphorous are {{commonly associated with}} massif-type anorthosites and related rocks. This rock association {{is part of the}} anorthosite–mangerite–charnockite–(rapakivi-) granite suites that are restricted to the Proterozoic. Understanding the geochemistry and emplacement mechanisms of ilmenite, magnetite and apatite ore deposits is crucial for exploration, efficient mining operations and ore processing. This review discusses the controlling factors on the grade of an ore, its mineralogy, and its major and trace element distribution. We present petrogenetic models of currently mined deposits (Lac Tio, Tellnes, Damiao) and discuss the characteristics of minor ore bodies from anorthosite provinces worldwide (Grenville, North China Craton, East European Craton, Rogaland, Laramie). Models of formation of anorthosite and related rocks are presented, as well as the nature of the possible parental magmas of the suite. A mineralogical classification of Fe–Ti ores is proposed: (1) Gabbro-noritic ilmenite ore ± apatite ± magnetite; (2) Ti-magnetite-dominated ore; (3) Nelsonite (Fe–Ti oxides + apatite); and (4) Rutile-ilmenite ore. The stability of ilmenite and magnetite is then critically reviewed and the influence of various factors, particularly oxygen fugacity and crystallization pressure, is examined. We discuss liquidus compositions of Fe–Ti oxides and the behavior of important trace elements such as Cr and V, both of which are sensitive to fO 2 variations. Post-cumulus evolution of both oxides can occur due to re-equilibration with trapped liquid, re-equilibration with ferromagnesian silicates, exsolution, oxidation, reaction between ilmenite and magnetite, and metamorphic overprinting. These various processes are described and their effects on the oxide geochemistry are emphasized. Several potential ore-forming processes have been invoked and can explain the formation of huge concentration of ilmenite, ± magnetite, ± apatite. Fractional crystallization can be combined with crystal sorting and plagioclase buoyancy to produce relative enrichment of dense ore minerals. Silicate liquid immiscibility can segregate conjugate Si-rich and Fe-rich melts, the latter being enriched in Fe–Ti–P. Magma mixing can produce hybrid magmas located in a single-phase field of the phase diagram and precipitate a pure ilmenite cumulate. Alternative processes are also described, such as ejection of Fe–Ti-enriched residual melts by <b>filter-pressing</b> and compaction, solid-state remobilization of ilmenite in veins, and hydrothermal transport of Fe and Ti from the host anorthosite followed by concentration in veins and lenticular ore bodies. The magnetic properties of Fe–Ti ore deposits present contrasting signatures, depending on whether the natural remanent magnetization is dominated by hemo-ilmenite or multi-domain magnetite. Micro- and macro-scale deformation features of ore rocks are intimately correlated with magma emplacement, and with ballooning of the anorthosite diapir associated with gravitational sagging of dense ore bodies. Exploration perspectives show that oxide-apatite gabbronorites are interesting targets because ilmenite in these rocks is poorer in Cr and Mg, and because the Ti-resource may be combined with apatite and vanadiferous magnetite.

40|$|Extended high-iron {{differentiation}} occurred {{while the}} gabbroic rocks of Hole 735 B were undergoing intense ductile and brittle deformation beneath a spreading ridge segment near Atlantis II Fracture Zone, Southwest Indian Ridge. Within the partially molten mass, the deformation formed fissures, cracks, and porphyroclastic to gneissic shear zones with fine-scale porosity structure into which dense, iron-rich liquids or crystal mushes could migrate. The iron-rich liquids differentiated from melts squeezed during the deformation from interstitial spaces in adjacent or nearby olivine gabbros and troctolites, {{most of which}} retain a porosity of less than 3 %, based on low abundances of TiO 2, P 2 O 5, and Zr. Oxide minerals formed at a very late stage from the squeezed liquids and were left in places as extensive ilmenite-rich concentrates, following compaction of the partially molten surrounding rock and continued <b>filter-pressing</b> of residual liquids. The oxide concentrates contain abundant undeformed globular aggregates of pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite and thus crystallized after most ductile deformation had taken place. Most {{of the content of}} potassium, phosphorus, zirconium, and other excluded elements squeezed from the rocks was reincorporated into intruding basalt magmas, producing enhancements of the abundances of these elements in drilled basalts and dredged basalt glasses. A semiquantitative liquid line of descent has been estimated for FeO*, TiO 2, P 2 O 5, MnO, and sulfur abundances, based on starting glass compositions from basalts dredged from the Atlantis II Fracture Zone and gabbro bulk compositions and mineralogy. Parental melts were sodic and titanium-rich abyssal tholeiites, typical of the region. Four somewhat different parental magma types were involved, based on strontium compositions of the gabbros. These produced variably differentiated gabbros that alternate throughout the section. The oxide gabbros were derived from the two more Sr-rich parental lineages. Progressive iron enrichment is presumed to have taken place to the point of immiscible separation of siliceous and very iron-rich liquids, as indicated by the mineral data and comparisons to experimental analogs. The siliceous component at Hole 735 B is represented by late trondhjemitic dikelets in oxide ferrogabbros, whereas the iron-rich liquids probably were the sources of many of the oxide concentrates. Both silicic and iron-rich segregations locally penetrated porosity space in more primitive crystallizing gabbros, reacting with minerals and intercumulus liquids already present. Liquid density calculations indicate that the iron-rich liquids should have sunk through crystal cumulates until porosity-limiting horizons were reached, whereas the siliceous liquids were buoyant. The iron-rich liquids left from immiscible segregation of trondhjemite had high abundances of sulfur (> 3000 ppm) and MnO (> 0. 6 %), accounting for the consistently high abundances of globular sulfides in the oxide concentrates and the high MnO contents of ilmenites. Deformation accelerated subsolidus recrystallization of the gabbro mass and carried it to virtually every rock. Plagioclase, pyroxenes, and oxide minerals consequently have modified compositions. Pyroxene and two-oxide thermometers indicate that the transition between ductile and brittle deformation took place below about 900 °C.

The primary nature of the prevalent and penetrative fabrics in LGS (layering and compactioninduced magmatic foliation), indicate that the gabbroic suite emplacement occurred under P-T conditions above those of the amphibolite facies regional metamorphic peak. The LGS internal architecture grossly mimics the geometry of the Évora-Beja-Aracena Domain, defining a series of nested sigmoid-like shapes. The earliest record of ductile tectonic deformation (often with magmatic imprint) took place before the ≈ 340 Ma D 2 a- D 2 b regional rising of the ductile-brittle transition. Shearing progressed under gradually brittle conditions throughout the early stages of D 3 causing E-W rotation of the layering southwards of each Series. Propagation/reactivation of late fault zones continued under fully brittle conditions until Late Variscan times. LGS rocks show subalkaline character compatible with low-pressure fractionation of tholeiitic suites revealing mild LREE+Ba enrichment, strong to moderate depletion in Nb-Ta and Th-Rb and LILE/HFSE decoupling. LGS melts derived from a time-integrated, mildly depleted radiogenic source with influence of enriched mantelic components. Previous/repeated melt extraction events may account for the increasing of the mafic character and bulk lowering of the incompatible element budget towards LGS top. The formation of LGS and other regional magmatic events developed from early to late collisional times of the Variscan orogeny may be explained by underplating of basaltic juvenile magmas along-strike of the Ossa Morena Zone (OMZ) SW border at 350 ± 5 Ma, caused by slab break-off as a consequence of subduction blocking. SB I troctolite are primary oxidized magmas, proxy for LGS parental magmas. A first magmatic event of extensive differentiation produced SB I-SB II-ODV I Series. Other LGS Series (ODV II, III, BRG I, II) are macrorhythmic successions resulting from repeated incoming of magma replenishments with similar initial composition that attained limited degree of fractionation. Storage and crystal fractionation within transient deep magma chambers explains the more evolved and homogenous composition of LGS Series relatively to SB I parental magmas. Low-pressure fractionation and mixing of variable proportions of resident magma within the outcropping middle/upper crustal chamber caused further fractionation within each Series. BIC mesocratic rocks diorite, ATT /border facies and pegmatoid dykes are genetically related to LGS, all deriving from the same mantelic source with different contributions from lower and upper crustal rocks. It is proposed that the underplating of basaltic magmas at OMZ lower crust gave rise to a deep hot crustal source zone (DCHZ), envisaging the BIC evolution as a single long-lived magmatic event of progressive diversification due to the reworking of OMZ crustal rocks trough time. Small volumes of hydrous melts isotopically and geochemically similar to LGS magmas produced the early diorite. Mild lower crustal contamination in LGS magmas was gradually replaced by a stronger role of upper crustal contamination. Compositionally evolved Series reflect the progression of AFC processes favoured by longer upper crustal residence times. Upper crustal contamination occurred also by incorporation of crustal-derived fluids enriched in radiogenic Sr, heavy δ 18 O ± CO 2, ascribed to progressive devolatilization/dehydration of the OMZ upper country rocks during the emplacement of BIC suites. Late emplaced ATT/border facies are hybrid melts with strong contributions from lower crustal fertile rocks, LGS basaltic residual melt and cumulate plagioclase, acquired during large incubation times at depth. Following the regional crustal uplift at 340 ± 5 Ma, admixing of crustal and magmatic fluids (from diorite and/or LGS) generated the pegmatoid dykes and a magmatic-hydrothermal system that overlaps ODV I amphibolitic gabbro (reflecting entrainment of melts from the adjoining diorite). Odivelas type I mineralization are Fe-Ti-V massive accumulations of oxides enveloped by ODV I oxide-rich rocks. The prevailing oxidising conditions and the recurrent fractionation/replenishment buffered the Fe-Ti enrichment within a calcalkaline path for most Series. Oxide-rich rocks fractioned from magmas that followed a tholeiitic Fe-Ti enrichment under lower oxidation conditions due to decreasing of recharge and crystallization rates; these conditions favoured the V-partitioning into magnetite. Previous segregation of sulphide melts and transient opening of the system to oxygen may explain oxygen supersaturation triggering oxide fractionation. Increasing trapped melt fraction proportions with high Fe/Mg support that density driven processes are most important in geochemically/mineralogically evolved domains, playing a major role in oxide accumulation/segregation. ODV I Series reflects a self-sustained process of oxide deposition and lowering of fO 2 with strong density stratification of the magma and ponding of dense cool ferro-basaltic melt followed by convective overturning. Gravity-aided physical processes (e. g. <b>filter-pressing),</b> account for ODV I complex architecture and the development of type I oxide masses. Late oxidation of the former Ti-magnetite to maghemite is tentativally ascribed to high-temperature fluids related to the amphibolitic gabbro meteoric hydrothermal system at E. Type II mineralization are metal-poor sulphide veins hosted in a metasomatic halo superimposed to ODV III Series Upper Group exposed at the Ventoso quarry. The 344 Ma Pb-model ages for the sulphides overlap the pegmatoid 342 ± 9 Ma SHRIMP-zircon age and suggest that both are expressions of the same hydrothermal event, also recorded in ODV III Upper Group rocks. The sulphides result from mixing of a strongly diluted magmatic fluid (higher Ni/Cu) exsolved from LGS cumulates and/or late developed diorite suites and exogenous low Ni/Cu, heavy δ 34 S hydrothermal crustal fluids derived from OMZ country rocks. Both components were metal-deficient and the metal upgrading was possibly accomplished through chemical scavenging during the alteration of ODV III Upper Group rocks (including disseminated magmatic sulphides). Type III mineralization are intercumulus to massive Ni-Cu-Co rich sulphides representing mss + iss mixtures with negligible trapped sulphide melt. Important occurrences are hosted in BRG II Lower Group clinopyroxenites and BRG I Upper Group olivine norites, located at the Figueirinha and Serrabritas quarries, respectively. Sulphide melts segregated from Ni-PGE undepleted magmas and interacted with relatively high amounts of silicate magma (R [500 - 1500) ]. Several critical features for Figueirinha suggest ore-zoning in a relatively large ore-forming system, with significant higher metal contents than those of minor pyroxenitichosted occurrences at the Nain Labrador. Serrabritas sulphides developed under reduced oxidation conditions, supporting a relationship between overlying oxide accumulations. Sulphide segregation may reflect assimilation of reduced metasedimentary rocks rich in graphite/organic matter with subsequent isotopic homogenisation in magma. Two genetic hypotheses are proposed for Figueirinha. If the sulphides are endogenous and genetically related to BRG II Series, a transient contamination event could account for sulphide segregation at the Lower/Intermediate Group transition; sulphide accumulation should proceed in a low dynamic environment (low R values) by density-driven, ponding with rapid Ni-depletion of silicate magma. If the sulphides are exogenous relatively to BRG II Series, their formation could be related to felsification during the lower crustal contamination of mafic basaltic magma, further emplaced along with the ATT suite hybrid magmas. The first scenario configures a lower economic potential (similar to that of Serrabritas), due to the absence of efficient dynamic traps within the intrusion to concentrate sulphide; the second is a more favourable setting akin to highly economic sulphide ore-forming systems at magmatic conduits. Multifractal modelling of soil Cu-geochemistry in several OMZ southern border geological units discriminates among the large diversity of documented Cu-bearing systems. Several conspicuous geochemical anomalies not associated with currently acknowledged mineralised occurrences in OMZ may represent relevant findings in a near future, particularly concerning skarn-type ore systems. O compartimento oeste da sequência gabróica bandada de Beja (LGS) compreende sete Séries que hospedam três tipos de mineralizações e quatro sequências de rochas não gabróicas também incluídas no Complexo Ígneo de Beja (BIC). As fábricas mais penetrativas predominantes no LGS (bandado magmático e foliação induzida por compacção) são de natureza primária e indicam que a sequência bandada foi desenvolvida em condições P-T acima do pico metamórfico regional em fácies anfibolítica. A arquitectura interna do LGS revela um conjunto de formas sigmóides encastradas que mimetizam a geometria envolvente do domínio de Évora-Beja-Aracena. A cedência dúctil precoce (frequentemente com sobreposição magmática) precede a transição entre as fases de deformação D 2 a-D 2 b, coincidindo com o ressalto litosférico que condiciona a ascensão da transição dúctil-frágil, datada de ca. 340 Ma. A acomodação da deformação cisalhante perdurou em condições progressivamente mais frágeis desde os estádios precoces de D 3, com consequente rotação E-W do bandado magmático para Sul de cada Série. A propagação/reactivação de zonas de falha tardias prosseguiu em regime frágil durante o periodo|$|R

The regeneration of the cofactor NADH was ensured electrochemically, using either methyl viologen or a rhodium complex as electrochemical mediator. A semipermeable membrane (dialysis or ultra-filtration) was integrated in the <b>filter-press</b> electrochemical reactor to confine the enzyme(s) {{as close as possible}} to the electrode surface. When methyl viologen was used, the transformation ratio of cyclohexanone varied from 0 to 65 % depending on the internal arrangement of the reactor. Matching the reactor configuration to the reaction system was essential in this case. With the rhodium complex, the ultra-filtration MER was tested in continuous and recycling configurations. The best conditions led to 100 % transformation of 0. 1 L volume of 0. 1 M cyclohexanone after 70 h with the recycling mode.

The experiments were carried out on a laboratory <b>filter-press</b> cell connected to OH and PEF-treatment systems. OH (60 V/cm, 50 Hz) was used to attain different temperatures (30 - 70 C), which were maintained during a fixed time (10 - 30 min). It {{was followed by a}} PEF treatment (600 V/cm, 0. 04 s). OH noticeably enhances the extraction kinetics even at a moderate temperature of 50 C. With the increase of OH temperature to 60 C, the juice yield obtained by pressing is comparable to the one obtained after PEF treatment. The results show that combining OH and PEF treatment leads to some synergetic effect, promoting 85 - 87 % of juice extraction even from middle and coarse cuts. This affect might result from both the electropermeabilization of cell membranes and the thermal softening of tissues...|$|E

The electrolyses were performed with and without membrane separating the cell compartments [(homogeneous anionic (Nafion R 117), heterogeneous cationic (Ionac MC- 3470) and heterogeneous anionic (Ionac MA- 3475) ]. The influence of the membrane on the rate of CuII removal was bigger for cationic membranes. Current efficiencies up to ca. 55 % (Ionac MC- 3470) for CuII removal at 30 mA cm- 2 were obtained. By combining oxidation and reduction, 100 % CuII removal was achieved at current efficiencies of 75 %. The main path for the removal is the electrostatic interaction with the anode followed by diffusion through the membrane and deposition at the cathode.

The charge required for 90 % decolorization (Q 90) and the chemical oxygen demand removal percentage after 30 min electrolysis (COD 30) were used to model the system. The investigated independent variables were the current density, pH, NaCl concentration, and temperature. Low values of Q 90 (0. 2 - 0. 3 A h L- 1) were obtained at acidic conditions (pH 1 - 3) and high concentrations of NaCl (1. 0 - 2. 0 g L- 1), when Cl 2 and HOCl are the predominant oxidant species. The best values of COD 30 were obtained at high current densities and acidic to neutral conditions (pH 5 - 7); however, the consequent energy consumption makes the process not economically feasible under these conditions.

Electrolyte flow through the reactor channel was numerically calculated using a finite volume approach to solve the Navier–Stokes equations. The length of the channel was divided into 7 sections corresponding to distances of 0, 0. 01, 0. 04, 0. 08, 0. 12, 0. 14 and 0. 15 m from the electrode edge nearest to the inlet. The depth of the channel was divided into three planes parallel to the channel bottom. For each channel section, a velocity profile was obtained at each depth together with the average velocity in each plane. The flow predictions show that the flow development, as the electrolyte passes through the cell, is strongly affected by the manifold causing strong vortex structures at the entrance and exit of the channel. Although the flow disturbances are a function of the flow rate, they gradually disappear downstream along the channel length.
