50|$|At the morgue, {{the coroner}} (Fred Keating) {{estimates}} the dead girl's age to be 16 or 17. He announces {{the cause of}} death multiple sharp force injuries across the neck region. He also notes vaginal bruising, a broken finger, and a spinal cord nicked by a serrated <b>edge.</b> <b>Holder</b> asks if he left a 'Calling Card', to which the coroner states that the killer must have used a condom. Reddick suggests they give the case to fellow detective Tim Jablonski (Phil Granger). They leave after the coroner wishes Holder luck on his sergeant's exam. Jablonski agrees to take the case, although Holder is reluctant. He still needs to sign some paperwork.|$|E
50|$|The Diamond Jubilee Medal {{followed}} {{the design of}} Golden Jubilee Medal. It measures 30 mm in diameter. On the obverse Queen Victoria is depicted crowned and wearing a veil which falls {{over the back of}} the head and neck, with the text VICTORIA D.G. REGINA ET IMPERATRIX F.D.. The reverse bears the words IN COMMEMORATION OF THE 60TH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF QUEEN VICTORIA · 20 JUNE 1897 within a garland of roses, shamrock and thistles. The medal was designed by Clemens Emptmayer, with the portrait of Queen Victoria based on a design by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm. The ribbon is garter blue with wide white stripes towards each <b>edge.</b> <b>Holders</b> of the 1887 medal who qualified were awarded a bar inscribed '1897' and surmounted by a crown, to be attached to the ribbon of the existing medal.|$|R
30|$|Remanence {{measurements}} {{were carried out}} using a 2 G 3 -component DC SQUID magnetometer (model 755 – 4.2  cm discrete sample system) at the Center for Advanced Marine Core Research (CMCR), Kochi University. We used a sample holder specially designed for zircon measurements. The holder was made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and cylindrical form of 7  mm in diameter and 6  cm in length (Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The sample holder was fixed in a stainless rod and inserted into a sensing region of the magnetometer. The zircon crystal was sandwiched between the two Scotch Magic Transparent Tapes of 5 [*]×[*] 5  mm (sandwiched sample) and set at an <b>edge</b> of the <b>holder</b> using the Scotch Double Sided Tape (3  M). To keep a sample orientation, we fixed the zircon crystal sandwiched between the Transparent Tapes from NRM measurement to end of demagnetization/remanence measurement processes. In a sequence of remanence measurements, the sample holder was fixed in the stainless rod, and we only changed the sandwiched sample at an <b>edge</b> of the <b>holder.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, several {{problems}} were experienced {{with the construction}} of Dixon Drive, a main road running around the <b>edge</b> of <b>Holder</b> between Holder and Duffy. A section of roadway between Burrinjuck Crescent and Warragamba Avenue, formerly a natural watercourse, was closed due to water periodically flowing across the road during heavy rains. In December 1971 a 20 ft section of the road then caved in. Problems with water flooding across the road from the Weston Creek channel near Streeton Drive were also experienced, and a section of the road between Warragamba Avenue and Streeton Drive remained closed for nearly 18 months until remediation works with the channel were completed in late 1972. A section of the old Kambah Road between Cotter Road and Dixon Drive was used to give access to residents while remediation works were being carried out.|$|R
40|$|A new {{technique}} {{to measure the}} principal refractive indexes of a nematic liquid crystal is presented. The method {{is based on an}} indirect measurement of the refraction angle by determining the direction of a magnetic field which minimizes the light scattering. With this technique one can perform different light scattering experiments, which require a knowledge of the refractive indexes, on the same crystal slab. The accuracy is better than ± 0. 15 %.

50|$|The {{good run}} of form {{continued}} in the Serie A, with Reggio Emilia grabbing a sixth place before taking Luigi Datome's Roma to seven games in their quarterfinals series, losing game 7 in the Eternal City in front of 600 away fans. Qualified for another European competition, the third-tier EuroChallenge, a team spearheaded by EuroChallenge Final Four MVP Andrea Cinciarini - helped by James White among others - recorded an emphatic 79-65 victory over Triumph Lyubertsy in a packed PalaDozza Bologna arena to win their first even international title on 27 April 2014 in front of 4.000 enthusiastic fans. On the domestic front they again reached the playoffs but were <b>edged</b> 2-3 by <b>holders</b> Montepaschi Siena in their quarterfinal series, after a controversial defeat in a game 4 played at home with Reggio Emilia 2-1 at the time marked by bad refereeing.|$|R
5000|$|Both Ignis and Simmenthal raced {{ahead of}} the others, so much {{that by the time}} they met each other in Varese on 27 December 1970 they were both unbeaten, with only Fides Napoli having {{provided}} any serious opposition.The game was already seen as title-deciding, Ignis had the best defence (60,1 points conceded per game to Simmenthal's 63.8) but the Milanese were more prolific in attack (81.8 points per game to Varese's 79.4) and were seen to have a slight <b>edge</b> over the <b>holders.</b> [...] Ultimately, Varese would win a hard-fought if not spectacular game 71-58, Meneghin out-rebounded Massimo Masini to score 16 points while Vittori and Flaborea dominated in attack (the first scoring a game-high 22 points).Though Giorgio Giomo shackled Raga well and Kenney put in a fighting performance (15 points), it was not enough for Simmenthal, not helped by an anonymous performance from Renzo Bariviera (3 points).|$|R
40|$|Diversos fatores podem exercer influência sobre o processo e o resultado da restauração ecológica, determinando sua viabilidade no longo prazo. Dentre estes fatores, a largura da faixa de plantio tem sido apontada como um limitador da recuperação da integridade biológica de ambientes ribeirinhos, devido aos efeitos de borda intensificados em áreas estreitas e alongadas. Deste modo, este estudo objetivou identificar possíveis influências da largura da faixa de mata ciliar em restauração sobre a comunidade vegetal. Para tal, foram selecionadas 10 faixas de reflorestamento com aproximadamente oito anos de implantação e com diferentes larguras (10 até 120 m). No centro de cada faixa foram estabelecidas cinco parcelas de 100 m², e em cada um dos três reflorestamentos com as maiores larguras de faixa foram estabelecidas adicionalmente cinco parcelas na borda voltada para a agricultura e cinco na borda voltada para o reservatório. Em cada parcela foi realizado o levantamento das características florísticas, estruturais e microclimáticas. Os resultados obtidos indicam que a largura da faixa de reflorestamento não exerceu influência sobre a maioria das variáveis analisadas. No entanto, na região central das faixas mais largas houve maior abundância e riqueza de espécies não plantadas. Tal fato pode ser uma resposta a eventuais condições propícias de microssítio, não presentes nas bordas detentoras de elevada cobertura herbácea. É válido ressaltar que embora a largura da faixa não exerça uma influência expressiva sobre a comunidade vegetal de reflorestamentos com oito anos de implantação, e independentemente se exercerá no futuro, é de {{fundamental}} importância a influência destas áreas restauradas com larguras apropriadas para a proteção dos recursos hídricos. Many {{factors may}} influence the process and result of the ecological restoration, determining their long term viability. Among those factors, the permanent preservation width {{has been identified as}} a limiter of the biological integrity recovery of riparian zones, due to the intensified edge effect in narrow and elongated sites. Thus, the goal {{of this study was to}} identify the possible influences of the width of riparian reforestation on the plant community. Ten reforestation strips were selected, about eight years old and with different widths (10 to 120 meters). In the center of each strip five plots of 100 m² were established, and in each one of the three wider strips more five plots at the edge facing the crop field and five at the edge facing the reservoir were established. In each plot the floristic, structural and microclimatic characteristics were recorded. The results showed that for most of the analyzed variables the strip width is not exerting influence. However, the core of the wider strips showed greater abundance and richness of species not planted. The results showed that for most of the analyzed variables the strip width is not exerting influence. However, the core of the wider strips showed greater abundance and richness of species not planted. Such fact may be a response to micro site conditions, which are not present at <b>edges,</b> <b>holders</b> of high herbaceous cover. Although the strip width does not exert a strong influence on the plant community of reforestation with eight years old, and regardless if will exert in the future, it is of fundamental importance the influence those restored sites with appropriate widths to the protection of water resources...|$|R
500|$|On the October 2, 2006 {{episode of}} Raw, {{interference}} from the newly reformed D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) cost Edge his [...] "final chance" [...] at John Cena's WWE Championship in a Steel cage match, though their interference {{was a response}} to the interference of Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, led to Edge approaching Randy Orton and asking him to join forces to defeat DX, which Orton accepted and joined an alliance with Edge. The two formed the tag team Rated-RKO. Rated-RKO became the first to defeat DX since their reunion, at Cyber Sunday, Rated-RKO defeated D-Generation X with Eric Bischoff as the special guest referee, at Survivor Series, Rated-RKO teamed with Johnny Nitro, Mike Knox and Gregory Helms to face Team DX (Triple H, Shawn Michaels, CM Punk and The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff Hardy)) but all members of Team Rated-RKO were eliminated. Rated-RKO quickly dominated the Raw brand's tag team division to become tag team champions, making <b>Edge</b> a record <b>holder</b> of 11 World Tag Team Championship title reigns in his WWE career. Due to Lita retiring that night, her on-screen relationship with Edge abruptly ended, with no explanation.|$|R
