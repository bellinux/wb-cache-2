5|$|After the {{departure}} of Massasoit and his men, Squanto remained in Plymouth to teach the Pilgrims how to survive in New England, for example using dead fish to <b>fertilize</b> the soil. For {{the first few years}} of colonial life, the fur trade was the dominant source of income, buying furs from Native Americans and selling to Europeans, beyond subsistence farming. Shortly after {{the departure}} of the Mayflower, Governor Carver suddenly died. William Bradford was elected to replace him and went on to lead the colony through much of its formative years.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{also made}} up an {{important}} part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American agricultural practices and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and potatoes. Besides the crops themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop rotation and the use of dead fish to <b>fertilize</b> the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E
50|$|In pronuclear transfer, an oocyte {{is removed}} from the recipient, and <b>fertilized</b> with sperm. The donor oocyte is <b>fertilized</b> with sperm from the same person. The male and female pronuclei are removed from each <b>fertilized</b> egg prior to their fusing, and the pronuclei from the recipient's <b>fertilized</b> egg are {{inserted}} into the <b>fertilized</b> egg from the donor. As with MST, a small amount of cytoplasm from the donor egg may be transferred, and as with MST, the <b>fertilized</b> egg is allowed to form a blastocyst, which can then be investigated with preimplantation genetic diagnosis to check for mitochondrial mutations, prior to being implanted in the recipient's uterus.|$|R
40|$|The {{fertilizer}} {{value of}} human urine was compared with mineral fertilizer in pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima) cultivation at {{a dose of}} 113 kg N ha- 1 with no-fertilization used as control. The growth of the vine was better in urine <b>fertilized</b> pumpkins than in mineral <b>fertilized</b> and non-fertilized pumpkins. Total fruit biomass was higher in mineral <b>fertilized</b> plants compared to urine <b>fertilized</b> and non-fertilized pumpkins. Urine <b>fertilized</b> pumpkins may have suffered from lower potassium or higher chloride, thus they produced fewer flowers and fruits. However, total fruit biomass {{and the number of}} fruits were slightly higher in urine <b>fertilized</b> plants than in their non-fertilized counterparts, i. e. 17. 2 t ha- 1 more pumpkin could be produced with urine fertilizer. The microbial hygiene quality as well as the contents of soluble sugars, protein and taste quality were similar in all treatments, but lower nitrate and higher chloride contents were recorded in urine <b>fertilized</b> pumpkins than other treatments. In conclusion, our study shows that the production rate of urine <b>fertilized</b> pumpkins was somewhat lower than mineral <b>fertilized</b> pumpkins but it was higher than non-fertilized pumpkins. The hygienic quality was equally good with all treatments. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} dealing with fertilization of winter oilseed rape with sulphur in elemental and sulphate form and it examines the effect of different variants of fertilization with sulphur containing fertilizers, which were applied in various phenophases. There was founded a small-plot field trial at the experimental field station of Mendel University in Brno, situated in Žabčice near Brno {{in the course of}} years 2014 and 2015. We compared yield and oiliness of the seeds of four variants: the first variant <b>fertilized</b> with elemental sulphur, the second variant <b>fertilized</b> with elemental and sulphate sulphur, the control unfertilized variant and variant <b>fertilized</b> only with nitrogen. There were not proved any statistically significant effects on yields between variants, even though both variant <b>fertilized</b> with sulphur proved increase in yields about around 26 % compared to unfertilized variant. Compared to the variant <b>fertilized</b> only with nitrogen had the variant <b>fertilized</b> with elemental sulphur 22, 5 % lower yield and the variant <b>fertilized</b> with elemental and sulphate sulphur 23, 1 % lower yield. Statistically insignificant was also effect on oiliness. Variant <b>fertilized</b> with sulphur proved approximately 5 % lower yields than unfertilized variant. In comparison to variant <b>fertilized</b> only with nitrogen had both variants by 1, 9 % and 1, 3 % higher oiliness...|$|R
5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to <b>fertilize</b> the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, and due to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to <b>fertilize</b> the egg.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} of bird {{life on the}} island has both relied on and helped to advance the spread of plant life. Birds use the plants for nesting material, but also continue {{to assist in the}} spreading of seeds, and <b>fertilize</b> the soil with their guano. Birds first began nesting on Surtsey three years after the eruptions ended, with fulmar and guillemot the first species to set up home. Twelve species are now regularly found on the island.|$|E
40|$|Burning and <b>fertilizing</b> {{pastures}} {{were evaluated}} on six Bluestem pastures by comparing performances by spring-calving cows and calves. Two control pastures were not burned or <b>fertilized,</b> two pastures were burned, {{and two were}} burned and <b>fertilized</b> with 40 pounds of nitrogen an acre applied aerially.

40|$|Equilibrium-tension lysimeters {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} and compare dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) leaching from a prairie and <b>fertilized</b> no-tillag a d chisel-plowed corn agroecosystems on Plano silt l am (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Argiudolls) in south central Wisconsin during four monitoring periods, March through April 1996, 1997, and 1998, and from January 1999 through September 2000. A low level of soluble P was found to leach from both natural and managed ecosystems. Dissolved reactive P leaching losses were higher from the managed compared to the natural ecosystems. The <b>fertilized</b> no-tillage agroecosystem consistently maintained higher DRP concentrations in soil leachate solutions compared to the <b>fertilized</b> chisel-plowed agroecosystem, which led to higher DRP leaching losses for the <b>fertilized</b> no-tillage agroecosystem, despite greater drainage from the <b>fertilized</b> chisel-plowed compared to the <b>fertilized</b> no-tillage agroecosystem.

5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and <b>fertilize</b> eggs, rather than being digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and <b>fertilize</b> the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
5|$|Mangroves {{also serve}} as {{excellent}} rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings <b>fertilize</b> the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like rails, terns and gulls; diving birds such as pelicans and grebes; and birds of prey such as ospreys, hawks and vultures are {{among the more than}} 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.|$|E
40|$|We have {{examined}} the claim that rabbit eggs penetrated by epididymal spermatozoa have a higher embryonic mortality than those <b>fertilized</b> by ejaculated spermatozoa. Spermatozoa from the lower corpus epididymidis inseminated into the uterus <b>fertilized</b> 76. 5 percent of 204 ova in comparison with 75. 9 percent of 199 ova <b>fertilized</b> by ejaculated spermatozoa of the same males inseminated into the contralateral uterine horn. Twenty-seven hours after insemination and HCG injection the 4 cell stage was reached by 11. 4 percent of ova <b>fertilized</b> by lower corpus sperm vs. 17. 4 percent <b>fertilized</b> by ejaculated sperm. When transferred to contralateral oviducts of synchronized recipients 60. 3 percent of 63 ova <b>fertilized</b> by lower corpus sperm implanted and 50. 8 percent developed normally to term, compared with 57. 1 percent and 47. 6 percent respectively for those <b>fertilized</b> by ejaculated spermatozoa. It appears, therefore, that once rabbit epididymal spermatozoa acquire the ability to penetrate the egg, they are equally as competent as ejaculated sperm to support normal embryonic and fetal development...|$|R

5|$|The {{cervical}} canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel to <b>fertilize</b> an egg cell after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must flatten and dilate to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use {{the extent of the}} dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.|$|E
5|$|Only Phoronis ovalis {{naturally}} builds colonies by budding or by splitting into top {{and bottom}} sections which then grow into full bodies. In experiments, other species have split successfully, but only when both parts have enough gonadal (reproductive) tissue. All phoronids breed sexually from spring to autumn. Some species are hermaphroditic (have {{both male and female}} reproductive organs) but cross-fertilize (<b>fertilize</b> the eggs of other members), while others are dioecious (have separate sexes). The gametes (sperms and ova) are produced in the swollen gonads, around the stomach. The gametes swim through the metacoelom to the metanephridia. Sperm exit by the nephridiopores and some are captured by the lophophores of individuals of the same species. Species that lay small fertilized eggs release them into the water as plankton, while species with larger eggs brood them either in the body's tube or stuck {{in the center of the}} lophophore by adhesive. The brooded eggs are released to feed on plankton when they develop into larvae.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs are {{dedicated}} parents. Many poison dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles {{stick to the}} mucus {{on the backs of}} their parents. Once in {{the upper reaches of the}} rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison frogs lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison frogs <b>fertilize</b> their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison frogs can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Oocytes {{collected}} from superovulated Swiss albino mice were activated by heat-shock and/or <b>fertilized</b> in vitro.

5|$|Temnospondyls, {{like all}} amphibians, {{reproduced}} in aquatic environments. Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through external fertilization. Like most living frogs, female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to <b>fertilize</b> them. Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 {{that may be}} egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls. They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs. The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo-like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings. They are attached to plant fossils, suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs. The mucous membranes show that the eggs were laid by amphibians, not fish (their eggs lack mucous), but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs. The eggs {{are thought to be}} from dissorophoids because {{they are likely to be}} close relatives of modern amphibians, and probably had similar reproductive strategies. They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the eggs were found.|$|E
5|$|The three remain undetected for two days, {{even as a}} {{probe and}} a group of the Martians {{themselves}} explore the basement. They also soon discover that the Martians are growing strange red-colored alien vegetation across the landscape and is quickly growing, covering trees and spreading into the basement, thus explaining the Martians' motives: to colonise Earth for their species, therefore making Earth a Mars-like planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue to <b>fertilize</b> the alien vegetation. Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping.

40|$|Summary We {{compared}} {{the range and}} variation in shoot silhouette area to projected leaf area ratio (SPAR) in <b>fertilized</b> and unfertilized (control) Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees. We measured SPAR for several view directions of 169 shoots at different depths in the crown of <b>fertilized</b> and control trees. There {{was an increase in}} SPAR with depth in the crown in both control and <b>fertilized</b> trees. In the <b>fertilized</b> trees, how-ever, mean SPAR was larger overall, the increase with depth in the crown was steeper, and there was a larger variation in SPAR with inclination and rotation angle of the shoot (relative to the view direction). In particular, shoots in the lower crown of <b>fertilized</b> trees were rotationally asymmetrical (“flat”) and had high values of the maximum ratio of shoot silhouette area to projected leaf area (SPARmax). Differences in SPAR between <b>fertilized</b> and control trees were explained by changes in shoot structure in response to fertilization and shading. Shoots of <b>fertilized</b> trees were larger and had more needle area than shoots of control trees. How-ever, the ratio of needle area to shoot size was smaller in fertil-ized trees than in control trees, implying less within-shoot shading and, consequently, a larger SPAR. Also, the increase in SPAR with increased shading (depth in the crown) could be explained by a decrease in the ratio of needle area to shoot size. In addition, because <b>fertilized</b> trees had more needle area than control trees, the effect of shading at a given depth in the crown was more pronounced in <b>fertilized</b> trees than in control trees...|$|R
