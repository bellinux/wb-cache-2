25|$|Two major {{strategies}} used for monitoring and controlling V. pensylvanica include trapping with synthetic chemical attractants and tree shaking.

25|$|Several {{different}} {{families of}} liquid crystals {{are used in}} liquid crystals. The molecules used have to be anisotropic, and to exhibit mutual attraction. Polarizable rod-shaped molecules (biphenyls, terphenyls, etc.) are common. A common form {{is a pair of}} aromatic benzene rings, with a nonpolar moiety (pentyl, <b>heptyl,</b> octyl, or alkyl oxy group) on one end and polar (nitrile, halogen) on the other. Sometimes the benzene rings are separated with an acetylene group, ethylene, CH=N, CH=NO, N=N, N=NO, or ester group.

50|$|JWH-019 is an {{analgesic}} chemical {{from the}} naphthoylindole family {{that acts as}} a cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors. It is the N1-hexyl homologue of the more common synthetic cannabinoid compound JWH-018. Unlike the butyl homologue JWH-073, which is several times weaker than JWH-018, the hexyl homologue is only slightly less potent, although extending the chain one carbon longer to the <b>heptyl</b> homologue JWH-020 results in dramatic loss of activity. These results show that the optimum side chain length for CB1 binding in the naphthoylindole series is the five-carbon pentyl chain, shorter than in the classical cannabinoids where a seven-carbon <b>heptyl</b> chain produces the most potent compounds. This difference is thought to reflect a slightly different binding conformation adopted by the naphthoylindole compounds as compared to the classical cannabinoids, and may be useful in characterising the active site of the CB1 and CB2 receptors.|$|E

The rearrangement chemistry of the N-chloro derivative was investigated. This underwent silver-ion catalysed solvolysis to afford 4 -methoxymethyl- 2 -methyl-l-pyrroline and also rearranged {{in the presence}} of alumina with retention of chlorine to give 2 -methyl- 2 -chloro-l-azabicyclo [2. 1. 1] hexane, a novel ring system. The hydrochloride salt of this chlorine-retaining product rearranged with aqueous base to afford 4 -hydroxymethyl- 2 -methyl-l-pyrroline. A study of 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrafluoro- 9, 10 -dihydroanthracen- 9, 10 -imines showed that electronic influences exhibit subtle effects on the mode of kinetically-controlled chlorination at the 11 -position and on the preferred orientation of the chlorine substituent under conditions of thermodynamic control. The influence of aryl substituents on the rate of aryl participation during silver-ion catalysed solvolysis was also investigated. The heterolytic rearrangement of 9 -chloro-l, 4 -dimethyl- 2, 3 -dihydronapthalen- 1, 4 -imines required the use of novel solvolytic conditions. Unlike their l, 4 -dihydro analogues, these preferred rearrangement to benzo (f) - 5 H-azepines which themselves underwent an extensive series of rearrangements. Investigation of 7 -chloro-l, 7 -diazabicyclo [2. 2. 1] heptane provided evidence that the effect of raising the barrier to nitrogen inversion by electronegative substituents arose predominantly from lone pair - lone pair repulsions. The 15 N NMR signals of a variety of systems containing the 7 - azabicyclo [2. 2. 1] <b>heptyl</b> skeleton were observed downfield of the most shielded examples reported for several classes of amine. X-ray crystallographic studies of two 9 -chloro- 2, 3 - dihydronapthalen- 1, 4 -imines, each possessing a different stereochemistry at nitrogen, showed that the position of the chlorine atoms exerts influence on the structure of the remainder of the 7 -azabicyclo [2. 2. l] <b>heptyl</b> skeleton...|$|E
