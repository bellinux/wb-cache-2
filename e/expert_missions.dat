5000|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} that in 1984 the CIA secretly started providing intelligence to the Iraqi army during the Iran-Iraq War. This included information to target chemical weapons strikes. The same year it was confirmed beyond doubt by European doctors and UN <b>expert</b> <b>missions</b> that Iraq was employing chemical weapons against the Iranians. Most of these occurred during the Iran-Iraq War, but WMDs were used at least once to crush the popular uprisings against Kurds in 1991. Chemical weapons were used extensively, with post-war Iranian estimates stating that more than 100,000 Iranians were affected Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons during the eight-year war with Iraq, Iran today is the world's second-most afflicted country by weapons of mass destruction, only after Japan. The official estimate {{does not include the}} civilian population contaminated in bordering towns or the children and relatives of veterans, many of whom have developed blood, lung and skin complications, according to the Organization for Veterans. Nerve gas agents killed about 20,000 Iranian soldiers immediately, according to official reports. Of the 90,000 survivors, some 5,000 seek medical treatment regularly and about 1,000 are still hospitalized with severe, chronic conditions. Many others were hit by mustard gas. Despite the removal of Saddam Hussein and his administration by American forces, there is deep resentment and anger in Iran that it was Western nations that helped Iraq develop and direct its chemical weapons arsenal {{in the first place and}} that the world did nothing to punish Iraq for its use of chemical weapons throughout the war. For example, the United States and the UK blocked condemnation of Iraq's known chemical weapons attacks at the UN Security Council. No resolution was passed during the war that specifically criticized Iraq's use of chemical weapons, despite the wishes of the majority to condemn this use. On March 21, 1986 the United Nation Security Council recognized that [...] "chemical weapons on many occasions have been used by Iraqi forces against Iranian forces"; this statement was opposed by the United States, the sole country to vote against it in the Security Council (the UK abstained).|$|E
5000|$|When {{the time}} came for {{resolution}} of the process, United Nations Secretary Gereral Kofi Annan appointed Martti Ahtisaari to lead the Kosovo status process in November 2005. In a period of fourteen months Ahtisaari held seventeen rounds of negotiations between Serbian and Kosovar officials in Vienna and made twenty-six <b>expert</b> <b>missions</b> to both capitals. These discussions had a great support of the Contact Group, which included the United States, the UK, France, Germany and Italy as well as Russia. On 2 February 2007, the final report was released which included the [...] "Ten guiding principles", which created a structure and authorities for the broad governing of Kosovo and its government. The report contained a broad provision for Kosovo's autonomy which included the power to enter into international agreements {{as well as to}} become a member of international organizations but the report also constrains Kosovo's sovereignty because of the power sharing arrangements with the minority groups that international missions had the power to enforce. The only contact group state that refused the proposal was Russia, stating that the Serbian part of the agreement was not held. Because of Russia's rejection of the plan, a [...] "Troika" [...] from German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier of representatives from the United States, European Union, and Russia held additional negotiations to reach an agreement. However, the parties were not able to reach an agreement on the final status of Kosovo. Despite the stalemate inside the international consensus, Kosovo declared independence on 17 February 2008 and the Assembly adopted a declaration of independence in accordance with the Special Envoy of the U.N. Ahtissari and the plan agreed by the official Prishtina. (8) It pledged to be a democratic republic and accept all the obligations under the Ahtisaari plan, including the adoption of a new constitution within 120 days. The Kosovo Assembly approved a new constitution in April 2008 and it went into effect on 15 June 2008. Although Kosovo declared independence in February, the U.N. did not approve the plan of the Special Envoy, Ahtisaari; the Constitutional Commission began to draft the Constitution as early as March 2007. The commission was to be composed of 21 Kosovo members, 15 appointed by the President of Kosovo, 3 by the Assembly holding seats reserved for minorities especially Serbs, and 3 members of other minority communities also appointed by the Assembly. First the sub-groups of the Commission published the drafted segments of the Constitution in late summer of 2007. Then the entire Commission submitted drafts for the reviewing process, internal and international advisors did the review. By the end of 2007, the Commission produced a draft constitution, directly derived from the Ahtisaari plan. After the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution was published for public comment, with more than 1000 comments from the public and the Commission holding public hearings for gathering more suggestions the final draft was created. The final draft was completed in April 2008 and the ratification process then went into force on 15 June 2008. The new Constitution created a parliamentary republic with pledges to protect minorities. In terms of structure, the President is the head of state and the Prime Minister, elected by the Kosovo Assembly, {{is the head of the}} government. The unicameral Kosovo Assembly contains 120 seats. Of those seats, ten are reserved for ethnic Serbs, ten for other designated minorities, and three are for other non-specified minority groups.|$|E

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of issues important to studying technocracy and economic decision-making in Southeast Asia. Historically the subject extends from the incorporation of non-communist states of the region into the US-molded post-World War II international order to the East Asian financial crisis of 1997. To Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand, advisory and <b>expert</b> <b>missions</b> of the United States, World Bank, and other international agencies bore "state-of-theart" economic policy-making and development planning that reserved a special, politically immunized role for technocrats. Yet, technocrats occupied a contentious position because of conflicting interests in changing conditions of underdevelopment, late industrialization, trade and investment liberalization, and financial globalization. As such, the assessment of the relationship between technocracy and economic decision-making in Southeast Asia should consider such opposed expectations as: the claims of technocratic efficacy against claims on social equity; demands of professional efficiency against demands of public accountability; appeals to state priorities against appeals to democracy; advances of national interests against defense of vested interests; promotion of economic targets against the attainment of social objectives; and the autonomy of technocrats against their captivity to patronage...|$|E

Since 1969, and in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), the IAEA has implemented a dosimetry audit service using mailed thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) to verify the calibration of radiotherapy beams in hospitals in Member States. The IAEA/WHO TLD service aims at improving the accuracy and consistency of clinical radiotherapy dosimetry worldwide.

40|$|Elucidation of in situ {{environmental}} processes {{is the key}} {{to effective}} ecosystem management. However, due to the complexity of coastal ecosystems, few tools are available to determine the inter-relationships and rates of these events. It is only when all of the important variables are understood and computationally described that effective ecological risk analysis can be accomplished. Model packages already exist which describe and predict specific coastal processes and further refinement of subroutines and user-interfaces has some value; however the truly significant advances lie in synergistic integration of different codes. Predictive ecological risk analysis requires transport models predicting contaminant concentrations under a range of environmental scenarios and bioaccumulation and trophic-transfer models using keystone species (or critical groups) identified by models elucidating trophic structure. In an attempt to elucidate natural processes, or solve environmental problems, stable and radioisotope tracers have a number of advantages over conventional techniques. Stable isotope studies replace visual observations of prey-predator interactions with statistically interpretable chemical data. Radiotracers provide real time kinetic data on uptake and transfer of specific contaminants and environmental transport processes. The unique assemblage and application of these nuclear and isotopic environmental probes will greatly assist in effective ecological risk assessment of present situations and the resource-economic evaluation of proposed management options.

40|$|International audienceCourt-ordered {{treatment}} {{was created in}} 1998, {{as part of a}} law against sexual offense recidivism. The creation of court-ordered treatment is {{based on the premise that}} many offenders have psychiatric disorders. If the court-ordered treatment is appraised as an effective way to prevent recidivism by the lawmaker, the preeminent role of psychiatry, in the prevention of recidivism has generated controversy in the psychiatric community. Few studies have been conducted on court-ordered treatment in France, and have concerned epidemiological measures. Court-ordered treatment leads to an extension of the <b>expert's</b> <b>mission.</b> In order to prevent recidivism, the interest of a treatment is a new part of the <b>expert's</b> <b>mission.</b> PURPOSE: The main purpose of this study was to assess the kind of diagnosis reported by the forensic psychiatrist who considered the court-ordered treatment as appropriate. METHOD: We led a descriptive and retrospective study among the experts' reports of 68  subjects followed by three psychiatrists. We categorized each diagnosis found in the experts' reports in reference to DSM-IV-TR axis I and axis II. As the expert has no obligation to refer to the DSM-IV-TR, we also considered the "no DSM-IV-TR categorized disorder" as a category. The primary outcome was the proportion of each diagnosis category in experts' reports, in which the forensic psychiatrist agreed with the indication of a court-ordered treatment. RESULTS: We analysed 123  experts' reports in which the mission was to diagnose a mental disorder and to assess the need for a court-ordered treatment. The expert agreed with the need for a court-ordered treatment in 112  reports. In those reports the diagnosis was "no disorder" in 27 % of them, "no DSM-IV-TR categorized disorder" in 26 % of them, "axis II disorder" in 24 % of them, "axis I disorder" in 19 % of them, and "association of an axis I and an axis II disorder" in 4 % of them. DISCUSSION: The diagnoses were heterogeneous. Their associations with the need for a court-ordered treatment seem to be contradictory when considering the association between "no mental disorder" and "need for a court-ordered treatment" found in 27 % of the reports. These paradoxical results led us to question the meaning of mental disorder and treatment...|$|R
