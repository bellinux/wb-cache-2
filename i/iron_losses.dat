50|$|Distribution {{transformers}} {{normally have}} ratings less than 200 kVA, although some national standards can allow for units up to 5000 kVA {{to be described}} as distribution transformers. Since distribution transformers are energized for 24 hours a day (even when they don't carry any load), reducing <b>iron</b> <b>losses</b> has {{an important role in}} their design. As they usually don't operate at full load, they are designed to have maximum efficiency at lower loads. To have a better efficiency, voltage regulation in these transformers should be kept to a minimum. Hence they are designed to have small leakage reactance.|$|E
50|$|If {{the applied}} voltage is normal voltage then normal flux {{will be set}} up. Since iron loss is a {{function}} of applied voltage, normal iron loss will occur. Hence the iron loss is maximum at rated voltage. This maximum iron loss is measured using the wattmeter. Since the impedance of the series winding of the transformer is very small compared to that of the excitation branch, all of the input voltage is dropped across the excitation branch. Thus the wattmeter measures only the iron loss. This test only measures the combined <b>iron</b> <b>losses</b> consisting of the hysteresis loss and the eddy current loss. Although the hysteresis loss is less than the eddy current loss, it is not negligible. The two losses can be separated by driving the transformer from a variable frequency source since the hysteresis loss varies linearly with supply frequency and the eddy current loss varies with the square.|$|E

This paper describes a simple analytical method to predict flux density waveforms in discrete regions of the laminated stator of a tubular PM machine, and employs an established <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> model to determine the <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> components, on both no load and on load. Analytical predictions are compared with the <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> deduced from finite-element analyses for two tubular PM machine designs, and it is shown that if a machine has a relatively high electrical loading, the on-load <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> can be {{significantly higher than the}} no-load value...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> {{in motor}} stators is {{measured}} using loss separation, where overall loss is measured and then other losses like windage, bearings, copper, and rotor losses subtracted. This technique is unsatisfactory because the stator <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> is typically {{smaller than the}} other losses subtracted and therefore a small error percentage wise {{in one of these}} other losses leads to a large error in the <b>iron</b> <b>loss.</b> A new technique is described that directly measures the stator <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> and therefore offers much improved accuracy.

40|$|Abstract – A new {{calculation}} method for <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> coefficients is proposed {{by using the}} Steinmetz equation from Epstein data. The hysteresis loss must have linear characteristic according to the frequency. However, the existing <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> coefficients are defined by formula of frequency. In this case, the hysteresis loss has non-linear characteristics by frequency. So, in this paper, the <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> coefficients were defined by {{a function of the}} magnetic flux density, and the <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> calculation is applied for Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor(IPMSM) of 600 (W) and 200 (W).

50|$|The test is {{conducted}} on the high-voltage (HV) side of the transformer where the low-voltage (LV) side or the secondary is short circuited. A wattmeter {{is connected to the}} primary. An ammeter is connected in series with the primary winding. A voltmeter is optional since the applied voltage {{is the same as the}} voltmeter reading. The LV side of the transformer is short circuited. Now with the help of variac applied voltage is slowly increased until the ammeter gives reading equal to the rated current of the HV side. After reaching at rated current of HV side, all three instruments reading (Voltmeter, Ammeter and Watt-meter readings) are recorded. The ammeter reading gives the primary equivalent of full load current IL. As the voltage applied for full load current in short circuit test on transformer is quite small compared to the rated primary voltage of the transformer, the <b>iron</b> <b>losses</b> in transformer can be taken as negligible here.|$|E

40|$|Linear motors {{are widely}} used in {{cryogenic}} fields to drive Stirling-type cryocoolers. Generally the Joule heat loss associated with copper lead is considered as the main loss in motors while the <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> is ignored at a lower frequency operation, not only because it’s regarded as small enough but also it’s difficult to measure or calculate. This paper introduces an experimental method to measure the <b>iron</b> <b>loss</b> for linear motors. Two kinds of moving-magnet linear motors have been tested, one is known as single coil and magnet linear motor, and the other as double coils and magnets linear motor.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} an enhanced dynamic {{model of a}} self-excited induction generator (SEIG) with <b>iron</b> <b>losses.</b> The <b>iron</b> <b>losses</b> are represented in the induction machine model with an equivalent resistance connected in parallel with the magnetizing reactance. Since these losses vary with the air-gap flux and the stator frequency, a series of no-load tests were performed using sinusoidal supply of various frequencies to determine this variation. The air-gap flux influence on the <b>iron</b> <b>losses</b> can be expressed {{by means of the}} corresponding iron loss current. Consequently, an enhanced induction generator model, including the equivalent iron loss resistance as a function of both stator frequency and iron loss current, was built in the MATLAB Simulink environment. In addition, this is, to the best knowledge of the authors, the first SEIG model which includes variable <b>iron</b> <b>losses</b> that is entirely built in MATLAB Simulink. The performance of the proposed model is analyzed through simulation under various operating conditions and compared with the conventional SEIG model in which the <b>iron</b> <b>losses</b> are neglected.
