25|$|On the surface, blue fire {{hydrants}} {{in the streets}} are <b>dry</b> <b>risers</b> connected to the Metro fire control system. If a fire breaks out in tunnels, firefighters connect the red fire hydrant with the blue terminals to power the subway system. This decoupling prevents accidental flooding.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} (1) a {{canonical correlation}} analysis {{that describes the}} relations between characteristics of a building and cost indices of fire protection equipment, and (2) how to apply the analysis for a standard and a trade-off for investment model of fire protection equipment when designers would decide to invest in fire protection equipment. The results of the analysis show that the variate pairs between characteristics of a building and cost indices of fire protection equipment are highly related, and also are available for a standard and a trade-off for investment model of fire protection equipment. Based on the canonical loadings, designers evaluate the installation of sprinkler systems against widths within the buildings, and decide to emphasize the installation of <b>dry</b> <b>risers</b> or sprinkler systems by comparison between the width and service cost index of the buildings. 1...|$|R
40|$|Solid {{particles}} were <b>dried</b> in the <b>riser</b> of circulating {{fluidized bed}} with internals {{to study the}} drying kinetics. Experiments were conducted in a circulating fluidized bed, having perforated plates as internals covering wide range in the operating parameters. The effects of various operating parameters, i. e., initial moisture content, temperature, and flow rate, of the heating medium and solid circulation rate on the rate of drying have been critically examined. It has been observed from the present investigation {{that the presence of}} internals enhances the solids holdup in the riser of circulating fluidized bed. The drying efficiency of a circulating fluidized bed with internals has been compared with the drying performance of a circulating fluidized bed without internals under the same operating conditions...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>dry</b> <b>riser</b> is a {{normally}} empty {{pipe that}} can be externally connected to a pressurized water source by firefighters. It is a vertical pipe intended to distribute water to multiple levels of a building or structure {{as a component of}} the fire suppression systems.|$|E

He was {{replaced}} by Lowell Killen, who is originally from the Isle of Man. He has played in other bands and left Manchester band <b>Dry</b> <b>Riser</b> to join Puressence.|$|E
50|$|An {{investigation}} into the fire {{found that there was}} no <b>dry</b> <b>riser</b> outlet on the 14th floor of the building as they were only located on alternate floors. The firefighters connected to the <b>dry</b> <b>riser</b> on the 13th floor, but then to fight the location of the fire, the hose had to pass through firedoors, which were then kept open. This led to the fire to have more oxygen {{due to the fact that}} compartmentation was not achieved. The two firefighters died when they got tangled in cable trays which were attached to the ceiling with plastic hooks which melted. The melting of plastic hooks was also listed as the cause for the death of two other firefighters during another tower block fire in Southampton five years later. It was after these subsequent deaths that changes to Building Regulations was imposed, namely to BS 7671, which covers electrical installations in the UK, and apply to the use of fire resistant cables in escape routes fixed to walls and ceilings, which came into force in July 2015. The regulation was not a retrospective one, meaning that it will only be enforceable on all new builds and not refurbishments.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{buildings}} have a [...] "wet riser" [...] or [...] "wet standpipe" [...] system where the pipes are kept {{full of water}} for manual or automatic fire fighting operations. Dry risers are used when the water pressure of a building wouldn't be enough for fire suppression, and in unheated buildings where the pipes could freeze. Dry risers have to allow access to a fire engine within 18 m of the <b>dry</b> <b>riser</b> inlet box. Dry risers in occupied {{buildings have}} to be within a fire-resistant shaft, usually one of a building's fire escape staircase enclosures.|$|E
