25|$|As a flow in {{a channel}} becomes supersonic, one {{significant}} change takes place.

However, once the flow becomes supersonic, the relationship of flow area and speed is reversed: expanding the channel actually increases the speed.|$|E

2500|$|Two rivers which {{feed the}} lagoon are the Arani river at the {{southern}} tip and the Kalangi River from the northwest, in addition to some smaller streams.

The lake acts as buffer to retain the accumulated flood water till the flood water is discharged gradually to the sea during the monsoon period and cyclones. The lake and its river basins are located both in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states. The lake and its drainage river basins become interstate river basin as per Interstate River Water Disputes Act 1956.

2500|$|Under {{steady state}} flow {{conditions}} (e.g. no flood wave), {{open channel flow}} can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. [...] Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. [...] This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in <b>flow,</b> <b>channel</b> geometry, roughness or channel slope. [...] During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn). [...] This depth {{is analogous to the}} terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013). [...] Typically, this depth is calculated using the Manning formula. [...] Gradually varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is very small. [...] In this case, hydrostatic relationships developed for uniform flow still apply. [...] Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice gate, weir, etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope. [...] Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant. In this case, hydrostatics relationships are not appropriate for analytical solutions, and continuity of momentum must be employed. [...] Examples of this include large changes in slope like a spillway, abrupt constriction/expansion of flow, or a hydraulic jump.|$|E
40|$|I deduced a 3 -D sunspot {{model that}} is in {{agreement}} with spectropolarimetric observations, {{to address the question}} of penumbral heating by the repetitive rise of <b>flow</b> <b>channels.</b> I performed inversions of data taken simultaneously in infrared and visible spectral lines. I used two independent magnetic components to reproduce the irregular Stokes profiles in the penumbra. I studied the averaged and individual properties of the two components. By integrating the field inclination to the surface, I developed a 3 -D model of the spot from inversion results without intrinsic height information. I find that the Evershed flow is harbored by the weaker of the two field components. This component forms <b>flow</b> <b>channels</b> that show upstreams in the inner and mid penumbra, continue horizontally as slightly elevated loops throughout the penumbra, and finally bend down in the outer penumbra. I find several examples, where two or more <b>flow</b> <b>channels</b> are found along a radial cut from the umbra to the outer boundary of the spot. I find that a model of horizontal <b>flow</b> <b>channels</b> in a static background field is in good agreement with the observed spectra. The properties of the <b>flow</b> <b>channels</b> correspond very well to the simulations of Schlichenmaier et al. (1998). From the temporal evolution in intensity images and the properties of the <b>flow</b> <b>channels</b> in the inversion, I conclude that interchange convection of rising hot flux tubes in a thick penumbra still seems a possible mechanism for maintaining the penumbral energy balance.

40|$|A {{model to}} predict the {{permeability}} of Non-Crimp Fabrics is proposed. The model {{is based on the}} geometrical features of the fabric. The stitches penetrating the uni-directional plies of the NCF induce distortions in the plane of the fabric. The dimensions of these Stitch Yarn induced fibre Distortions (SYD) are analysed for different fabrics in relaxed and sheared configurations. The length and width of the SYDs are found to be distribution values. The averaged value and the distribution change as the fabric is sheared. The SYDs form <b>flow</b> <b>channels,</b> which determine the permeability of the NCF.

50|$|The {{flow cell}} format is most {{commonly}} implemented in hematology instruments, and sometimes flow cytometers.

Further, the use of a flow cell lends itself to addition of a sheath flow, which keeps particles centered {{in the middle of the}} <b>flow</b> <b>channel.</b> This allows measurements to be performed simultaneously, such as probing the object with a laser.

50|$|Conditions {{within a}} {{continuous}} reactor {{change as the}} product passes along the <b>flow</b> <b>channel.</b> In an ideal reactor {{the design of the}} <b>flow</b> <b>channel</b> is optimised to cope with this change. In practice, this is achieved by breaking the reactor into a series of stages. Within each stage the ideal heat transfer conditions can be achieved by varying the surface to volume ratio or the cooling/heating flux. Thus stages where process heat output is very high either use extreme heat transfer fluid temperatures or have high surface to volume ratios (or both). By tackling the problem as a series of stages, extreme cooling/heating conditions to be employed at the hot/cold spots without suffering overheating or overcooling elsewhere. The significance of this is that larger flow channels can be used. Larger flow channels are generally desirable as they permit higher rate, lower pressure drop and a reduced tendency to block.|$|E

We identified 50 conjunction events during the southern winter seasons of 2007 – 2011. In a majority (45) of events, longitudinally narrow flow enhancements directed anti-sunward {{are found to be}} collocated with the patches, have velocities (up to a few km/s) substantially larger than the large-scale background flows (~ 500  m/s) and have widths comparable to patch widths (~ 400  km). While the patches start with poleward moving auroral forms (PMAFs) as expected, many PMAFs propagate azimuthally away from the noon over a few hours of MLT, resulting in formation of polar cap patches quite far away from the noon, as early as ~ 6 MLT. The MLT separation from the noon is found to be proportional to the IMF |By|. Fast polar cap flows of >~ 1500  m/s are predominantly seen during large IMF |By| and small |Bz|. The presence of fast, anti-sunward <b>flow</b> <b>channels</b> associated with the polar cap patches suggests that the <b>flow</b> <b>channels</b> form in the dayside auroral oval through transient reconnection and can be the source of <b>flow</b> <b>channels</b> propagating into the polar cap.|$|R
