50|$|They {{are used}} in many <b>dishwashers</b> to release the {{detergent}} dispenser door latch.

50|$|Many new <b>dishwashers</b> feature microprocessor-controlled, sensor-assisted wash cycles that {{adjust the}} wash {{duration}} to {{the quantity of}} dirty dishes (sensed by changes in water temperature) or the amount of dirt in the rinse water (sensed chemically/optically). This can save water and energy if the user runs a partial load. In such <b>dishwashers</b> the electromechanical rotary switch often used to control the washing cycle {{is replaced by a}} microprocessor but most sensors and valves are still required to be present. However, pressure switches (some <b>dishwashers</b> use a pressure switch and flow meter) are not required in most microprocessor controlled <b>dishwashers</b> as they use the motor and sometimes a rotational position sensor to sense the resistance of water; when it senses there is no cavitation it knows it has the optimal amount of water. A bimetal switch or wax motor opens the detergent door during the wash cycle.|$|R
