5|$|Tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli revised their tyre compounds for the 2012 {{season in}} an effort to encourage teams to use each of the compounds supplied for individual races. Pirelli predicted that the changes would translate into 0.7 seconds' difference per lap between the harder and softer compounds, down from 1.5 seconds per lap in 2011. According to Pirelli, the hardest tyre compound available is just 31% <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> softest compound on offer; by comparison, the hardest tyres used in 2011 were 70% <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> softest.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} has {{finished}} the thirty floors {{that make up}} the main game, a fourth companion character and additional, optional dungeons become available. These dungeons are <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> main game, but include highly powerful items as a reward for their completion. A puzzle-based dungeon called Fay's Puzzles is also available from the start, in the first town, hosting fifty puzzles about avoiding enemies, using items and moving carefully.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} titles, Ninja Gaiden III received mostly positive reviews from critics. Early reviews praised the game for its plot, gameplay, and difficulty; later reviews criticized it for that plot being overly outlandish, inconsistent level designs, and the game's difficulty level, in which the North American version was intentionally made <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Japanese version through limited continues, stronger enemies, and omission of a password system. The Atari Lynx port, while receiving general praise for graphics and controls, received poor reception for its sound and for the inability for players to see characters and items, attributing it to the Lynx's small screen.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. It exists in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> cubic form.|$|E

5|$|Only eight {{species of}} lemur {{are known to}} be seed predators (granivores), but this may be under-reported since most {{observations}} only report fruit consumption and do not investigate whether the seeds are consumed as well. These lemurs include some indriids, such as the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), the golden-crowned sifaka (Propithecus tattersalli), the indri, and the aye-aye. The aye-aye, which specializes in structurally defended resources, can chew through Canarium seeds, which are <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> seeds that New World monkeys are known to break open. At least 36genera from 23families of plants are targeted by lemur seed predators.|$|E
5|$|Released in 1981, Asteroids Deluxe is {{the first}} sequel to Asteroids. Dave Shepperd edited the code and made {{enhancements}} to the game without Logg's involvement. The onscreen objects were tinted blue, and hyperspace {{was replaced by a}} shield that depleted if used. The asteroids rotate, and the added killer satellite enemy breaks apart into three smaller ships when hit that home in on the player's position. The arcade machine's monitor displays vector graphics overlaying a holographic backdrop. The game is much <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> original and does not allow saucers to be hunteda common strategy for Asteroids high scores.|$|E
5|$|The hardest natural {{diamonds}} mostly {{originate from}} the Copeton and Bingara fields {{located in the}} New England area in New South Wales, Australia. These diamonds are generally small, perfect to semiperfect octahedra, and are used to polish other diamonds. Their hardness {{is associated with the}} crystal growth form, which is single-stage crystal growth. Most other diamonds show more evidence of multiple growth stages, which produce inclusions, flaws, and defect planes in the crystal lattice, all of which affect their hardness. It is possible to treat regular diamonds under a combination of high pressure and high temperature to produce diamonds that are <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> diamonds used in hardness gauges.|$|E

Harding won nationally {{in one of the most}} decisive landslides in American history, and New York, already a fiercely Republican state, went even <b>harder</b> for <b>Harding</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> nation, making New York a solid 12 percent more Republican <b>than</b> <b>the</b> national average.|$|R
5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} have {{a perfect}} and easy octahedral cleavage, {{which means that they}} only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures but those of the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> team thought.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} of beta carbon nitride (β-C3N4) was first proposed by Marvin Cohen and Amy Liu in 1989. It is isostructural with Si3N4 and was predicted to be <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> diamond. <b>The</b> calculated bond length was 1.47 Å, 5% shorter <b>than</b> <b>the</b> C-C bond length in diamond.

25|$|Dragon Quest IX {{continues}} the Dragon Quest tradition of turn-based combat {{and is considered}} <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other Dragon Quest games before it. The game allows players to have a cooperative wireless multi-player experience with up to four players; it does not, however, feature multi-player capabilities via Nintendo Wi-Fi. Multiplayer play requires a game cartridge for each player. The game includes only one save slot, whereas most have at least three.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{its limited}} road access, Kings Canyon {{receives}} much fewer visitors than its neighboring national parks, Sequoia and Yosemite. The overall decline in national park visitation {{in the late}} 1990s hit Kings Canyon considerably <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> other parks; from 1970 to 1990 it averaged almost a million visitors per year, but in the 21st century, it has averaged just 560,000. In 2016, it saw an increase to 607,479 visitors, which (with the exception of 2009) was the highest count since 1995. Since records began in 1904, an approximate total of 53 million people have visited Kings Canyon.|$|E

25|$|Another common {{application}} of case-hardening is on screws, particularly self-drilling screws. In {{order for the}} screws {{to be able to}} drill, cut and tap into other materials like steel, the drill point and the forming threads must be <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> material(s) that it is drilling into. However, if the whole screw is uniformly hard, it will become very brittle and it will break easily. This is overcome by ensuring that only the case is hardened and the core remains relatively soft. For screws and fasteners, case-hardening is achieved by a simple heat treatment consisting of heating and then quenching.|$|E
25|$|Heligoland's rock is {{significantly}} <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> postglacial sediments and sands forming the islands and coastlines {{to the east}} of the island. This is why the core of the island, which a thousand years ago was still surrounded by a large, low-lying marshland and sand dunes separated from coast in the east only by narrow channels, has remained to this day, although the onset of the North Sea has long eroded away all of its surroundings. A small piece of Heligoland's sand dunes remains—the sand isle just across the harbour called Düne (Dune). A referendum in June 2011 dismissed a proposal to reconnect the main island to the Düne islet with a landfill.|$|E
25|$|Combat is fast-paced and {{requires}} an offensive approach {{in order for}} players to combat dense hordes of enemies. The player character is agile {{and is able to}} dodge attacks by strafing around enemies while locked on. The new risk-and-reward style of gameplay is emphasized through Bloodbornes Rally system, which allows the player to, within a small window of time, recover portions of lost health by striking an enemy. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki explained that this is representative of the player's increased will to continue after successfully striking an enemy. A New Game Plus mode is also present; after the player has finished the game, a new game will immediately be started. New Game Plus is optional, players retain all their equipment, and the game is <b>harder</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> previous play through.|$|E
