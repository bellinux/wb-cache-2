40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel patch-guided <b>initial</b> <b>deformation</b> estimation framework for improving {{performance of the}} existing registration algorithms. It is challenging for the registration algorithm to directly align two images with large anatomical shape difference, when no good <b>initial</b> <b>deformation</b> is provided. Inspired by the patch-based multi-atlases segmentation method, we propose to estimate the <b>initial</b> <b>deformation</b> between two images (under registration) in a patch-by-patch fashion. Specifically, after obtaining the sparse representation for each local patch in the subject by using the training patches in the over-complete dictionary that include both patches and their associated deformations from the training images, the <b>initial</b> <b>deformation</b> for each local subject patch can be predicted by those estimated sparse coefficients. More specifically, after registering all training images to the template in the training stage, the following three steps {{can be used to}} register any given subject image. First, for each key point in the subject, we can construct a coupled dictionary from the nearby patches in the training images and their associated deformations, and can then use this dictionary to seek for sparse representation of the respective subject patch. The estimated sparse coefficients can be used to fuse the associated deformations in the dictionary, for estimating the <b>initial</b> <b>deformation</b> for the respective subject key point. Second, after estimating the initial deformations on a small number of key points in the subject, thin-plate spline (TPS) can be applied to interpolating the dense deformation field. Finally, we can apply any existing deformable registration method (with reasonable performance) to estimate the remaining deformation from the template to subject. Experimental results on both simulated and real data show that our patchguided deformation estimation framework can allow for more accurate registration than the direct use of the original methods for registration. ...|$|E

40|$|Fission {{transients}} {{describe the}} fission rate as it evolves towards the quasistationary value given by Kramers' formula. The nature of fission transients {{is dependent on}} the assumed initial distribution of the compound nuclei along the fission coordinate. Although the standard initial assumption of a near-spherical object leads to a transient suppression of the fission rate (fission delay), a moderate <b>initial</b> fissionlike <b>deformation</b> can reduce the magnitude of this suppression. For still larger <b>initial</b> <b>deformations,</b> transient fission enhancements are possible. Examples of this behavior are illustrated via a one-dimensional Langevin simulation. It is argued that the initial conditions are determined by the fusion dynamics and thus are entrance-channel dependent. Transient fission may be considered intermediate between statistical fission and quasifission as the rapid time scale of transient fission may not lead to an equilibrium of the angular and mass-asymmetry coordinates. The relationship between the mean first passage time and the transients are discussed. For temperatures much smaller than the fission barrier, the mean first passage time is independent {{of the nature of the}} fission transients if there is no strong competition from evaporation. Thus, fission transients are most important when the evaporation time scale is smaller than, or of the order of, the transient time. Comment: Submitted to Phys Rev. ...|$|R

The creep deformation perpendicular to the grain was decreased by cross laminating. The creep deformation perpendicular to the grain of parallel-laminated woods (P⊥ type), that perpendicular to the grain of face laminae of cross-laminated woods (C⊥ type), and also that parallel to the grain of face laminae of cross-laminated woods (C║ type) tended to decrease with increasing density of species used for perpendicular-direction lamina.

The extent of the decrease was much greater in creep deformation than in <b>initial</b> <b>deformation</b> and considerably smaller in buna with higher density than in sugi with lower density. The measured values of <b>initial</b> <b>deformation</b> and creep deformation of C⊥ type were almost equal to the calculated values obtained from the measured values of parallel-laminated woods, whereas the measured values of both deformations of C║ type were much greater than their calculated values and increased markedly with increasing shear compliance in cross section of perpendicular-direction lamina used for core.
