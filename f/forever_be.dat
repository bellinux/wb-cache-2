5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would <b>forever</b> <b>be</b> thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is just out of reach.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the decade}} will <b>forever</b> <b>be</b> remembered for the apocalyptic edition of 1985, won by Eric Vanderaerden. The 23-year-old Belgian {{suffered}} a broken wheel before the Koppenberg, but {{returned to the}} front of the race in a group with Hennie Kuiper, Greg LeMond and his team-mate Phil Anderson. Vanderaerden, considered a sprinter, attacked on the Muur of Geraardsbergen and rounded off a 20km solo break. The race gained a place in cycling legend because a severe storm broke out in the second half of the race, with strong winds and torrential rainfall ravaging the peloton.

25|$|In 2012, Brazil {{passed an}} affirmative action law {{in an attempt}} to {{directly}} fight the legacy of slavery. Through it Brazilian policy makers have forced state universities, regarded very highly because it is free and of high quality, to have a certain quota of Afro-Brazilians. The percentage of Afro-Brazilians to be admitted, as high as 30% in some states, causes great social discontent that some argue furthers racial tensions. It is argued that these high quotas are needed because of the unequal opportunities available to Afro-Brazilians. In 2012 Brazil’s Supreme Court unanimously held the law constitutional. However, in sectors like education, political representation, and overall quality of life, opportunities and capabilities for Afro-Brazilians will continue to increase. Brazil's government will continue to provide for all of its people as it sees fit, but the issue of slavery and its legacy may <b>forever</b> <b>be</b> felt in all facets of Brazilian life.|$|E
25|$|Brisbane – The {{first signs}} of a Collingwood/Brisbane rivalry {{originated}} in 1999, when Brisbane comprehensively beat the Magpies in the last ever AFL match at Victoria Park. In Round 8 2002 Collingwood beat Brisbane by three points in a tense match in front of 46,279 people at Colonial Stadium. This victory over the reigning premier took the Magpies to equal top of the league table (2nd on percentage) with Brisbane. The rivalry grew with the 2002 Grand Final when Brisbane beat Collingwood by nine points. The rivalry grew again in 2003 when the two clubs clashed on four occasions. The Lions defeated the Magpies at The Gabba in Round 4 before thrashing them in Heritage Round — Round 19 at the MCG. Collingwood then defeated Brisbane in the Qualifying Final with Alan Didak ensuring victory late in the final quarter, with two goals from the boundary line. The rivalry peaked in the 2003 Grand Final with Brisbane easily defeating Collingwood to win the premiership. The rivalry cooled off to a degree in the period following Brisbane's loss in the 2004 Grand Final due a sustained period of success at Collingwood {{and a string of}} poor seasons at Brisbane, however Dayne Beams recent defection to the Lions has seemingly reignited the rivalry. Despite Brisbane's string of poor seasons, the rivalry remains ignited due to many Collingwood supporters remaining bitter about the two grand final losses {{and the fact that the}} Brisbane Lions will <b>forever</b> <b>be</b> the last team to win a VFL/AFL match at Victoria Park.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, Elliott {{sold his}} team to Ray Evernham and began driving the No. 9 Dodge Dealers/UAW-sponsored Dodge Intrepid the {{following}} year. The team found success in his first race in the No. 9 Dodge, as Elliott won the pole for the 2001 Daytona 500 and finished in the Top 5, bringing home a 5th-place finish, though the race will <b>forever</b> <b>be</b> remembered {{for the death of}} fan favorite Dale Earnhardt. Elliott finished his first season with Evernham Motorsports with two poles, five Top 5's, and nine Top 10 finishes, and one win at the Pennzoil Freedom 400 at Homestead from the pole. This was his first win in over seven years. He finished 15th in the final points standings. In 2002, he won four poles and went to victory lane twice; those wins included the Pennsylvania 500 {{and one of the most}} dominant victories in the history of the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway a week later He finished 13th in the final points standings. His last win, in what became his final full-time season, came in 2003 at Rockingham. A week later, Elliott came within a lap of winning his final race as a full-time driver (he would have been the only retiring driver to do so) in the 2003 Ford 400 at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Elliott led 189 of 267 laps and was on his way to victory, but a cut tire on the final lap allowed Bobby Labonte to score the victory (his last and most recent win to date). He still finished the race and maintained his ninth-place position in the final points standings, his best points finish since finished eighth in the 1997 standings. A few weeks later, Elliott announced that he was relinquishing the No. 9 car to Kasey Kahne and switching to a part-time schedule driving R cars for Evernham.|$|E
