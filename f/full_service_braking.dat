30|$|The {{average in}} service {{deceleration}} achieved with manual driving during braking of the Metrocars has been measured at 0.5  m/s 2 by previous work, {{well below the}} <b>full</b> <b>service</b> <b>braking</b> figure of around 1.3  m/s 2 [43]. For ATO, the London Underground Central Line {{can be used as}} a point of comparison. This uses a target deceleration of 0.75  m/s 2 when running above ground and 1.15  m/s 2 in underground sections. The full service maximum here is also around 1.3  m/s 2, and this provides an illustration of the differences in deceleration levels for manual driving and ATO referred to above. However, when the Central line ATO system was first introduced, there were significant issues with low wheel/rail adhesion levels on above-ground sections, with wheel slide under braking resulting in unacceptable levels of wheel flats and station overruns. Low adhesion conditions on the line are most commonly reported during autumn, typically due a combination of light rain and fallen leaves on the rails. When these conditions are present, the ATO target deceleration is reduced to 0.55  m/s 2, in addition to other mitigation measures such as railhead treatment [44].|$|E
25|$|Prior to each {{leaf fall}} season many train {{companies}} arrange low adhesion training for their newly qualified drivers. This consists of taking over {{a section of}} line during a quiet period. Using lineside markers each driver gets his train up to speed and then makes a <b>Full</b> <b>Service</b> <b>brake</b> under normal adhesion conditions. The railhead is then treated with a contaminant that has a low coefficient of friction. On the second run the driver will experience the sound and sensation of the train sliding, and the stopping distance will be considerably greater.|$|R

50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes</b> concurrently with the front <b>service</b> <b>brakes,</b> resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the relay valve for remote <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> application.|$|R
40|$|Problem statement. By {{means of}} {{mathematical}} modelling it is investigated longitudinal forces of non-uniform bulk trains at various ways of braking. Various schemes of {{formation of the}} bulk trains, consisting of four-axised and eight-axised tanks with various level of incomplete filling of transported liquid are considered. It is estimated the influence of level of filling of a copper of the tank by liquid on longitudinal forces of trains at braking. For {{the decision of the}} given problem the trains made from 30 four-axised and 30 eight-axised cars-tanks and one locomotive VL- 8, located in the head of a train were considered. For the estimation of longitudinal forces emergency and <b>full</b> <b>service</b> <b>braking</b> at speeds of movement 30 km/h and 60 km/h on a horizontal site of a way were considered. At mathematical modelling it was supposed that tanks were filled by black oil in density ρ = 0, 99 t/m 3. Various variants of removal of the level free surface of liquid from the top internal surface of a copper of the tank were considered. The incomplete filling was accepted equal 0, 4; 0, 8; 1, 2 metres. Scientific results. As a result of calculations diagrammes of distribution of the maximum longitudinal forces along the length of a train and brake ways for various schemes of formation and different level of incomplete filling of transported liquid have been received. Various braking of preliminary stretched and compressed trains are considered. Conclusions. The received results show that in need of driving the bulk non-uniform as cars-tanks (4 - axised and 8 - axised) trains their formation should be made with installation of eight-axised tanks {{in the first half of}} the structure...|$|E

50|$|With a <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{relay valve}} installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers, and quickly applies the rear <b>service</b> <b>brakes.</b> The pressure delivered to the <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> chambers.|$|R

50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit.

The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer <b>service</b> <b>brake</b> hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|R

25|$|In normal {{operation}} for locomotive/carriage trains, on descending and level running, {{the train is}} normally <b>braked</b> (<b>service</b> <b>braking)</b> using the locomotive.

40|$|Purpose. As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} paper {{it is necessary to}} study the waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on longitudinal train dynamics at different modes of braking. At this one should estimate the level of maximum longitudinal forces and braking distance size in freight cars of various lengths. Methodology. In this paper we attempt to approximate the actual diagram of braking cylinders filling with rational functions of varying degrees. In selection of coefficients in the required functions the highest values of the longitudinal forces and braking distances were used as controlled parameters. They were compared with similar values obtained as a result of experimental rides. The level of longitudinal forces and braking distances amount were evaluated by means of mathematical modeling of train longitudinal vibrations, caused by different braking modes. Findings. At mathematical modeling was assumed that the train consists of 60 uniform four-axle gondola cars, weight of 80 tons, equipped with air dispenser No. 483 included in the median operation, composite braking blocks, and one locomotive VL- 8. Train before braking has been pre-stretched. Various types of pneumatic <b>braking</b> (emergency, <b>full</b> <b>service</b> and adjusting <b>braking)</b> of the freight train on the horizontal section of the track were simulated. As the calculation results were obtained values of the longitudinal forces, braking distances amounts and reduction time in speed at various braking modes. Originality. Waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on the longitudinal forces level and braking distances amount in freight trains were investigated. Also the longitudinal loading of freight trains at various pneumatic braking was investigated. Practical value. Obtained results can be used to assess the level of largest longitudinal forces and braking distances in the freight trains of different lengths by mathematical modeling of different braking modes...|$|R
