Why {{do we need to}} <b>digitize</b> our local <b>content?</b> How do we <b>digitize</b> local <b>content?</b> And how do the <b>digitized</b> local <b>content</b> help in preserving and transmitting African literary and cultural heritage to the world at large? Furthermore, recent initiatives at digitizing and transmitting local content were highlighted while constraints to digitizing and transmitting African local content were also identified. However, the paper concluded and made recommendations on how Nigeria can join the rest of Africa in improving and promoting our local content in the Global Information Infrastructure (GII), which is seen presently to be minimal...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Some special {{features}} should be identified when digitizing archival materials.

40|$|Abstract In the {{information}} society, {{the volume of}} born-digital <b>contents</b> and <b>digitized</b> <b>contents</b> from original resources is rapidly increasing. Therefore various types of digital contents, such as text, images, movies and other data types, are stored into digital archive systems and key technologies are long-term preserving storage, database management system, information retrieval, web service and others. The one of major application programs is CMS (Contents Management System), some types of CMSs focus on specific functions in order to administrate digital contents and support a work flow in museums. In this paper, using several CMS softwares, we also develop a digital gallery of "the Anthropological Museum of Nanzan University " in order to organize various collections with metadata and photographs. Firstly, we consider metadata attributes based o...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} open access {{initiatives}} {{in terms of}} open access publishing and institutional repositories for scholarly communication in Sri Lanka. Relevant data from Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), OpenDOAR and Sri Lanka Journals Online (SLJOL) were analyzed to study the status of open access in Sri Lanka. Further, websites of all established institutional repositories (IR) of Sri Lanka were explored to gather the relevant data. Semi-structured interviews with Librarian of National Science Foundation and the staff involved {{in the development of}} many IRs and digitization projects were also carried out. Findings show that many libraries in Sri Lanka have established institutional repositories. The recently created national open access policy is under review. Different universities and special libraries such as science and technology libraries were granted financial and technical support by the NSF for <b>digitizing</b> their rare <b>contents.</b> However, all <b>digitized</b> <b>contents</b> have not been uploaded yet.

40|$|Sound {{reproduction}} via a noncontact surface mapping {{technique has}} {{great potential for}} sound archives, aiming to <b>digitize</b> <b>content</b> from early sound recordings such as wax cylinders, which may otherwise be “unplayable” with a stylus. If the noncontact techniques are {{to be considered a}} viable solution for sound archivists, a method for quantifying the quality of the reproduced signal needs to be developed. In this study, a specially produced test cylinder recording, encoded with sinusoids, provides the basis for the first quantitative analysis of signal reproduction from the noncontact full surface mapping method. The sampling and resolution of the measurement system are considered with respect to the requirements for digital archiving of cylinder recordings. Two different methods of audio signal estimation from a discrete groove cross section are described and rated in terms of signal-to-noise ratio and total harmonic distortion. Noncontact and stylus methods of sound reproduction are then compared using the same test cylinder. It is shown that noncontact methods appear to have distinct advantages over stylus reproduction, in terms of reduced harmonic distortion and lower frequency modulation...|$|R
