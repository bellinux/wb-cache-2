A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|R

Hidden under the temporal, frontal and parietal opercula, as well as under dense {{arterial}} and venous vessels, its accessibility is particularly restricted. Functional data on this region in humans, therefore, are scarce and the existing evidence makes conclusions on its functional and somatotopic organization difficult. 5 patients with intractable epilepsy underwent an invasive presurgical evaluation with implantation of <b>diagnostic</b> invasive-depth <b>electrodes,</b> including insular electrodes that were inserted using a mesiocaudodorsal to laterorostro-ventral approach. Altogether 113 contacts were found to be in the insula and were stimulated with alternating currents during preoperative monitoring.

A relatively high density of elec-trode contacts enabled us to delineate several functionally distinct areas within the insula. We found somatosensory symptoms to be restricted to the posterior insula and a subgroup of warmth or painful sensations in the dorsal posterior insula. Viscerosensory symptoms were elicited by more anterior electrode contacts with a subgroup of gus-tatory symptoms occurring after stimulation of electrode contacts in {{the central part of the}} insula. The anterior insula did not show reproducible responses to stimulation. In line with previous studies, we found evidence for somato- and viscerosensory cortex in the insula. In addition, our results suggest that there is a predominantly posterior and central distribution of these functions in the insular lobe...|$|R

It is of major technical importance to predict surface flashover events for a given window geometry, material and power level.

50|$|Intramuscular EMG can be {{performed}} {{using a variety of}} different types of recording electrodes. The simplest approach is a monopolar needle electrode. This can be a fine wire inserted into a muscle with a surface electrode as a reference; or two fine wires inserted into muscle referenced to each other. Most commonly fine wire recordings are for research or kinesiology studies. <b>Diagnostic</b> monopolar EMG <b>electrodes</b> are typically insulated and stiff enough to penetrate skin, with only the tip exposed using a surface electrode for reference. Needles for injecting therapeutic botulinum toxin or phenol are typically monopolar electrodes that use a surface reference, in this case, however, the metal shaft of a hypodermic needle, insulated so that only the tip is exposed, is used both to record signals and to inject. Slightly more complex in design is the concentric needle electrode. These needles have a fine wire, embedded in a layer of insulation that fills the barrel of a hypodermic needle, that has an exposed shaft, and the shaft serves as the reference electrode. The exposed tip of the fine wire serves as the active electrode. As a result of this configuration, signals tend to be smaller when recorded from a concentric electrode than when recorded from a monopolar electrode and they are more resistant to electrical artifacts from tissue and measurements tend to be somewhat more reliable. However, because the shaft is exposed throughout its length, superficial muscle activity can contaminate the recording of deeper muscles. Single fiber EMG needle electrodes are designed to have very tiny recording areas, and allow for the discharges of individual muscle fibers to be discriminated.|$|R

The modifications simplify the continuous-flow (AutoAnalyzer) manifold, decrease baseline noise, increase the sensitivity, and permit use of a less-expensive fluorometer.

Day-to-day precision (CV) during the past year for samples that included three different lots of quality-control sera was 2 to 3 %.

40|$|OBJECTIVE Cochlear {{implants}} (CI) {{are standard}} treatment for prelingually deafened children and postlingually deafened adults. Computed tomography (CT) {{is the standard}} method for postoperative imaging of the electrode position. CT scans accurately reflect electrode depth and position, which is essential prior to use. However, routine CT examinations expose patients to radiation, which is especially problematic in children. We examined whether new CT protocols could reduce radiation doses while preserving diagnostic accuracy. METHODS To investigate whether electrode position can be assessed by low-dose CT protocols, a cadaveric lamb model was used because the inner ear morphology is similar to humans. The scans were performed at various volumetric CT dose-indexes CTDIvol) /kV combinations. For each constant CTDIvol the tube voltage was varied (i. e., 80, 100, 120 and 140 kV). This procedure was repeated at different CTDIvol values (21 mGy, 11 mGy, 5. 5 mGy, 2. 8 mGy and 1. 8 mGy). To keep the CTDIvol constant at different tube voltages, the tube current values were adjusted. Independent evaluations of the images were performed by two experienced and blinded neuroradiologists. The criteria diagnostic usefulness, image quality and artifacts (scaled 1 - 4) were assessed in 14 cochlear-implanted cadaveric lamb heads with variable tube voltages. RESULTS Results showed that the standard CT dose could be substantially reduced without sacrificing <b>diagnostic</b> accuracy of <b>electrode</b> position. The assessment of the CI electrode position was feasible in almost all cases up to a CTDIvol of 2 - 3 mGy. The number of artifacts did not increase for images within this dose range as compared to higher dosages. The extent of the artifacts caused by the implanted metal-containing CI electrode {{does not depend on}} the radiation dose and is not perceptibly influenced by changes in the tube voltage. Summarizing the evaluation of the CI electrode position is possible even at a very low radiation dose. CONCLUSIONS CT imaging of the temporal bone for postoperative electrode position control of the CI is possible with a very low and significantly radiation dose.

40|$|Landslides {{are often}} the result of complex, {{multi-phase}} processes where gradual deterioration of shear strength within the sub-surface precedes the appearance of surface features and slope failure. Moisture content increases and the build-up of associated pore water pressures are invariably associated {{with a loss of}} strength, and thus are a precursor to failure. Consequently, hydraulic processes typically {{play a major role in}} the development of landslides. Geoelectrical techniques, such as resistivity and self-potential are being increasingly applied to study landslide structure and the hydraulics of landslide processes. The great strengths of these techniques are that they provide spatial or volumetric information at the site scale, which, when calibrated with appropriate geotechnical and hydrogeological data, can be used to characterise lithological variability and monitor hydraulic changes in the subsurface. In this study we describe the development of an automated time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ALERT) and geotechnical monitoring system on an active inland landslide near Malton, North Yorkshire, UK. The overarching objective of the research is to develop a 4 D landslide monitoring system that can characterise the subsurface structure of the landslide, and reveal the hydraulic precursors to movement. The site is a particularly import research facility as it is representative of many lowland UK situations in which weak mudrocks have failed on valley sides. Significant research efforts have already been expended at the site, and a number of baseline data sets have been collected, including ground and airborne LIDAR, geomorphologic and geological maps, and geophysical models. The monitoring network comprises an ALERT monitoring station connected to a 3 D monitoring electrode array installed across an area of 5, 500 m 2, extending from above the back scarp to beyond the toe of the landslide. The ALERT instrument uses wireless telemetry (in this case GPRS) to communicate with an office based server, which runs control software and a database management system. The control software is used to schedule data acquisition, whilst the database management system stores, processes and inverts the remotely streamed ERT data. Once installed and configured, the system operates autonomously without manual intervention. Modifications to the ALERT system at this site have included the addition of environmental and geotechnical sensors to monitor rainfall, ground movement, ground and air temperature, and pore pressure changes within the landslide. The system is housed in a weatherproof enclosure and is powered by batteries charged by a wind turbine & solar panels. 3 D ERT images generated from the landslide have been calibrated against resistivity information derived from laboratory testing of borehole core recovered from the landslide. The calibrated images revealed key aspects of the 3 D landslide structure, including the lateral extent of slipped material and zones of depletion and accumulation; the surface of separation and the thickness of individual earth flow lobes; and the dipping in situ geological boundary between the bedrock formations. Time-lapse analysis of resistivity signatures has revealed artefacts within the images that are <b>diagnostic</b> of <b>electrode</b> movement. Analytical models have been developed to simulate the observed artefacts, from which predictions of electrode movement have been derived. This information has been used to correct the ERT data sets, and has provided a means of using ERT to monitor landslide movement across the entire ALERT imaging area. Initial assessment of seasonal changes in the resistivity signature has indicated that the system is sensitive to moisture content changes in the body of the landslide, thereby providing a basis for further development of the system with the aim of monitoring hydraulic precursors to failure...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} the effects of the {{electron}} absorption at the physical boundaries like walls, <b>electrodes,</b> <b>diagnostic</b> probes and divertors onthe plasma and sheath parameters. The effects of the electron absorption manifest themselves via lack of reflected electrons in their velocity distribution in approaching to the boundary. The rate of this lack toward the boundary determines the electron density profile. It turns out that the ion velocity distribution in laboratory and fusion plasmas is strongly (and in some cases entirely) determined by the electron density profile. This is apparently striking but, nevertheless, well established (and physically clear) why and how a kinetic picture, i. e., velocity distribution emerges from a hydrodynamic quantity. Whereas, in mathematical sense, we always prefer to calculate hydrodynamic quantities from the kinetic ones, in the nature this approach works well only when the thermodynamic equilibrium at least for the electron velocity population is obeyed. Otherwise, statistical systems became strongly influenced by the sources of non-equilibrium which, under consideration here, is represented by an electron sink, i. e., by electron absorbing boundaries. Our general task is to find how to best correlate the hydrodynamic and kinetic parameters up to such surfaces which terminate the plasma locally (i. e., electrodes) or globally (i. e. divertors) with special attention to the boundary conditions which arise in the approximate two scale-approach, i. e., at the plasma-sheath boundary. Here in particular we present a complete set of boundary conditions and consequent solutions on a basic and very important, but surprisingly rarely tackled plasma-sheath model when the electron velocity distribution is cut-off maxwellian. Basically we follow the methodology first applied by Tonks and Langmuir [1] and further elaborated for various cases during the previous century (see e. g., [2] and references therein). While the sheath boundary conditions and solutions for the case of strong electron absorption were already discussed by Andrews and Varey [3] the plasma region is here treated for the first time. Consequences of the results obtained from the sheath and plasma sides for this particular case to the general bounded plasma theory and its further possible developments and applications to laboratory and fusion devices are discussed.

40|$|Implantable brain {{computer}} interfaces (BCIs) {{promise to}} re-establish communication for severely paralyzed people. This thesis argues that decoding {{the acts of}} language production is a promising strategy for BCI control. Using high-field {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and high-density electrocorticography (ECoG) we studied the topographic representation of different acts of language production and the robustness of their activity patterns, to test the hypothesis of fine-grained topography. Given that the brain surface is covered with blood vessels, we first investigated the importance of positioning ECoG electrodes on brain tissue, by evaluating effects of bloodvessels on signal quality. We showed that the signal recorded by electrodes on top of blood vessels has a different frequency content compared to the signal recorded by electrodes that are in direct contact with the cortical surface. This is primarily the case for higher frequencies, which are most informative for BCI control. The absolute differences in power are only small; however, this becomes important in the context of implantable BCI systems where the absolute signal strength is a relevant factor, for example for the necessary pre-amplification of the signal before it can be transmitted. We subsequently tested the hypothesis that hand gestures from sign language can be discriminated based on their representation on the sensorimotor cortex on a single trial basis, by using fMRI and a 7 Tesla MRI scanner. Four complex hand gestures could be classified with an accuracy of 63 % (range 35 - 95 %; chance level 25 %). A small patch of cortex, around the hand knob area, was sufficient to make this discrimination. The classification accuracy varied considerably between participants, and appeared {{to be related to the}} consistency with which the gestures were executed. We tested the same hypothesis with implanted electrode grids in five epilepsy patients (implanted for <b>diagnostic</b> reasons). High-density <b>electrode</b> grids were implanted on the sensorimotor cortex. From the five patients, two had adequate hand-knob coverage for analysis. We showed that hand gestures could also be discriminated using ECoG signals. Four different hand gestures were classified with 97 % in one participant and with 73 % in the second participant. In the final phase we tested whether we could decode speech articulators, and showed that articulator movements can be discriminated based on their representation on the sensorimotor cortex on a single trial basis using 7 Tesla fMRI with an accuracy of 89 %. A small patch of cortex, the ventral half of the lateral sensorimotor cortex, was sufficient to make these discriminations, indicating that the articulator movements could also be distinguished using surface electrodes. This research shows that language related movements can be decoded based on the brain activity of a small patch of cortex. Further testing in paralyzed people is required to investigate potential applications of this work in BCIs...|$|R
40|$|In various applications, {{fuel cells}} are widely {{recognized}} as very attractive devices to obtain directly electric energy from the electrochemical combustion of chemical products. Low temperature fuel cells, which generally utilize proton electrolyte membranes, seem to be also of utility for a large of power applications. However, the final choice of the fuel is still difficult and depends greatly {{on the field of}} application. Utilization of pure hydrogen or hydrogen-rich gases, rather than alcohols, as fuels in Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) leads to higher electric efficiencies. Due to the problems related to the hydrogen storage, the hydrogen-oxygen PEMFC is the best choice for stationary applications. Direct alcohols (methanol and ethanol) fuel cells based on solid polymer electrolytes are widely proposed for portable and mobile applications due to relatively low prices of the methanol and ethanol fuels and easiness of storage. The major impediment in the development of fuel cells operating on hydrogen, methanol, and ethanol is deactivation of the anode electrocatalyst by trace level of CO. Thus, the most active Pt electrocatalyst for the oxidation of hydrogen and alcohols (e. g. methanol, and ethanol) is deactivated by strong adsorption of carbon monoxide, and leads to decreased performance of fuel cell. Therefore, a new inexpensive, stable electrocatalyst must be developed, which is tolerant to high levels of CO (particularly, for direct alcohol fuel cell) or that could preferably utilize CO. There are currently two state-of-the-art methods which increase CO tolerance of the fuel cell anode. One method is to use a Pt-alloy catalyst (e. g. PtRu, PtSn, PtMo,PtW). The other method is to use the zeolite as matrix, and limit the preferential formation of CO clusters on platinum by the steric constraints imposed by the zeolites framework, followed by facile oxidation to CO 2 by interaction with the surface or bridged hydroxyls of the zeolites. Furthermore, the porous nature of the zeolite support material provides relatively improved gas permeability and minimizes the disadvantage associated with restricted gas diffusion in the electrode. The ideal support would also an enhanced electrochemically active surface area by dispersion of the metal catalyst. Keggin-type heteropolyacids show appreciable acid catalytic properties that are of practical importance as illustrated in numerous recent reviews. The fact that heteropolyanions undergo spontaneous adsorption (from aqueous solution) on various substrates provides a simple tool for modification of electrode surfaces. Among other important issues related to electrocatalysis are their ability to undergo fast reversible multi-electron transfers and super-acid properties resulting in the increased availability and mobility of protons at the electrocatalytic interfaces. Consequently, polyacids were considered for fuel cell research. With respect to the oxygen reduction, the adsorbed heteropolyacid (particularly H 3 PW 12 O 40) nanostructures do not seem to block access of reactant molecules to catalytic Pt. Further, their presence at the interface shifts formation of the inhibiting Pt-oxo (PtOH or PtO) species towards more positive potentials thus increasing the potential range where catalytic metallic (Pt 0) sites exist. It is reasonable to expect that, by analogy to the activating role of WO 3 and partially reduced hydrogen tungsten oxide bronzes during elect oxidation of methanol, the related heteropolyblue tungstates should also enhance reactivity of Pt during oxidation of organic fuels. Stanis and co-workers reported that the addition of adsorbed HPAs can improve the performance of Pt anodes in a fuel cell under CO-poisoned conditions. Also Farell et al. postulated that HPAs can act as cocatalysts with platinum for methanol electrooxidation. Among limitations in practical applications of heteropolyacids is their very good solubility in aqueous solutions including acids as well as their ability to undergo desorption during long-term operation. Thus it is necessary to stabilize heteropolyacid layers at electrocatalytic interfaces without loosing their activating properties. An interesting alternative arises from the possibility of formation of acidic salts of heteropolytungstates or molybdates by partial exchange of protons with large cations (such as Cs+, Rb+, NH 4 + or K+) in the parent heteropolyacid. Consequently, a watersoluble polyacid of low surface area (< 5 m 2 g- 1) is transferred into a water-insoluble acid salt precipitate characterized by the surface area exceeding 100 m 2 g- 1. Contrary to zeolites exchanged with alkali metals, heteropolyacid salts remain strong acidity. The resulting materials have occurred to be efficient solid shape-selective acid catalysts for a variety of organic liquid-phase reactions that include hydrogenations and oxidations. The pore size and acidity of heteropolyacid salt can be controlled by the cation content. For example, when the Cs content, x, is initially increased in CsxH 3 - xPW 12 O 40 from 0 to 2, the number of surface protons decreases but, later, it significantly increases when x changes from 2 to 3 to show the highest surface acidity at x = 2. 5. In the present work, we consider the salts of Keggin-type heteropolyacids containing 2. 5 moles of Cs+ and Rb+ cations in 1 mole of the heteropoly salt. The system with such Cs or Rb-content is micro-mesoporous, and it is characterized by very good stability and, while being insoluble in water, it exhibits high acidity (proton availability and mobility). The aim of this work is to study the applicability of the Cs and Rb salts of Keggin type heteropolyacids as a stable meso-microporous matrix for anode catalyst for H 2 /O 2 Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell, Direct Methanol Fuel Cell and Direct Ethanol Fuel Cell. The experimental part is divided into four chapters (from 6 to 9). In the Chapter 6, we present characterization of cesium, rubidium and ammonium salts of Keggin types heteropolyacids by infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. In Chapter 7, we illustrate incorporation and activation of Pt centers in the conductive high surface-area zeolite-type robust, Cs 2. 5 H 0. 5 PW 12 O 40 matrices through application of mixing and electrochemical methods. To evaluate electrocatalytic activity towards the hydrogen oxidation of the investigated electrode material, we have performed the <b>diagnostic</b> rotating disc <b>electrode</b> voltammetric measurements. In a case of the catalytic layer prepared by corrosion of Pt counter electrode (electrochemical method), CO-stripping and HRTEM measurements have been performed to comment the electrochemically active area of catalyst, dimensions of Pt particles and platinum loading.
