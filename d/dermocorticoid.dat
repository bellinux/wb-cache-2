40|$|The topical {{treatment}} of psoriasis {{benefits from the}} alternate use of dermocorticosteroids and vitamin D 3 analogues. A new galenic formulation allows to combine them in a single application. Dovobet (LEO Pharma) ointment is the association of calcipotriol 50 microg/g with betamethasone dipoprionate 0. 5 mg/g. This formulation boosts the therapeutic activity of calcipotriol.

30|$|Patients and methods: Participants—ICU {{adults with}} septic shock or without sepsis {{admitted}} to the Raymond Poincaré university hospital. We also evaluated 10 healthy controls. Intervention—resistance to corticosteroids was assessed using a skin test. 10  µl of <b>dermocorticoid</b> cream (class III, Betamethasone) was applied on a 3  cm 2 surface of the skin. At 24  h, two independent physicians scored the blanching of the skin from 0 to 4 — 0 - no blanching +  1 - <  50 % of surface +  2 - 50 to 75 % of surface +  3 - 75 to 100 % of surface, and 4 - blanching beyond application area. Cohen’s kappa {{was used to measure}} concordance. A mean score of <  2 indicated corticoresistance and a score of 4 indicating normal sensitivity to corticosteroids. We also performed a 250  µg ACTH test.|$|E
