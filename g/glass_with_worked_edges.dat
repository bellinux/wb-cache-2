40|$|Asymmetric rolling of {{thin strip}} has become {{important}} {{due to a}} significant decrease of rolling force, which contributes to obtain the extremely thin strip, to reduce the rolling passes, and to save the energy by a decrease of anneal treatment. In asymmetric rolling of thin strip, <b>edges</b> of <b>work</b> rolls may contact and deform when no or small work roll bending force is applied. <b>Work</b> roll <b>edge</b> contact forms a new deformation feature. In this paper, the effects of initial thickness of strip and friction coefficient on the rolling pressure, roll edge contact length and strip crown during asymmetric rolling of thin strip <b>with</b> <b>work</b> roll <b>edge</b> contact effect has been discussed, and the calculated rolling force <b>with</b> <b>work</b> roll <b>edge</b> contact is compared with the measured value...|$|R

Surface roughness of the rolled strip {{on a cold}} rolling mill was characterized by a surface profilometer. Roll edge contact and related surface roughness transfer are discussed. The focus of this work on cold rolling of thin strip was to justify the roll bite contact mechanics and to analyse the friction in the roll bite {{and the effect of}} the friction on the strip profile and the surface finish. The work roll wear and its value are also discussed. The <b>work</b> roll <b>edge</b> contact affects the <b>work</b> roll <b>edge</b> wear significantly. The strip surface finish becomes better after rolling, and the calculated rolling forces are in good agreement with the measured values...|$|R

25|$|Six tombs {{were built}} on a {{perfectly}} outlined patio, one of them unfinished; there is another one associated to this group with the same characteristics; the walls are made with stone blocks perfectly cut and jointed with mortar; the floor is compacted earth; the tombs are covered by large stone slabs, some <b>with</b> <b>worked</b> <b>edges.</b> The location dimensions of six of them is very interesting as they were constructed symmetrically; in {{the central part of}} the group, the slab forming the roof of tomb number 2 serves as weight to number 4, that is oriented perpendicularly, with a cruciform aspect although in fact they are two rectangles. Each grave contained remains of an adult primary burial accompanied by rich and numerous offerings consisting of pottery, shell objects, bone and stone tools. A three by eighteen ditch was excavated, in which sixty three primary and secondary burials were found with numerous fragments clearly identified as decapitations or mutilations, that is to say, skulls with the atlas and maxillary bone in place or the bones of an arm with hand but without the rest of the body.|$|R

40|$|An {{influence}} function method {{has been developed}} to simulate the asymmetric cold rolling of thin strip <b>with</b> <b>work</b> roll kiss at edges.

The rolling mechanics and crown of the strip <b>with</b> <b>work</b> roll <b>edge</b> kiss, which are new findings for cold rolling of thin strip, are obtained. A comparison of the rolling force, roll edge kiss force and the strip crown after rolling has been conducted for various cross shear regions in the roll bite.

5000|$|Evidence of pre-Clovis {{activity}} {{was found at}} the SV-2 site. There are three archaeological horizons evident of human occupation located within a one-meter thick alluvial, colluvial, and lacustrine sediments overlying a pedestal of bedrock. These are dated within 14,510, and 13,500-13,000 RCYBP. The oldest horizon is dated to 14,510 + 80 RCYBP (Beta-117541) {{by the presence of}} a tibia bone tool from a musk ox that was AMS radiocarbon dated. [...] Evidence for the butchering/cooking of a mastodon was found in this level. It is believed that one individual was represented. Seven complete or partial ribs, two fragments of limb bones, one tooth, and nine pieces of tusk, all of these display alike surface characteristics lacking signs of fluvial abrasion or extensive subaerial weathering. Evidence that this mastodon was processed and cooked includes the presence of two sandstone knives <b>with</b> <b>worked</b> <b>edges</b> that were used to cut meat and/ or remove hide. A concretion representing a congealed mass of viscous fluid replaced by minerals, may represent fat drippings produced by cooking with fire. Fire cracked rocks and a burned mastodon tooth were also found. Also associated were a triangular stone used as a hand held ax or wedge, a piece of exotic chert used as wedge chert flake, and two pieces of bone modified by human agency. The first of these is an incised basicranial complex of a midsized herbivore, and possible tibia bone tool AMS dated back to 14, 510 RCYBP which suggests a Pre Clovis occupation. It was from the shaft of a right tibia of what was assumed to be a midsized adult musk-ox since it was too gracile to belong to a bison with identification also based on surface details, absolute size, elongative nature, and the presence of other musk-oxen bone and teeth. It measured 195.2 mm in length, 48.9mm in maximum width across the proximal end of the medial surface, 36 mm in peak width in transverse (medial-lateral) section. The tibia bone exhibits three pairs of parallel fractures, two percussion fracture cone in the medullary cavity, and extensive non-random patterned wear. The fractures could have either occurred with one or numerous blow with the goal of obtaining marrow. The wear pattern indicates that the bone tool was used as a scraper or flesher, and might have been used as meat or hide splitter.|$|R

50|$|Essentially, any {{stone that}} is often used in {{jewellery}} is likely to count as a hardstone. Hard organic minerals such as amber and jet are included, {{as well as the}} mineraloid obsidian. Hardstones normally have to be drilled rather than <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>edged</b> tools to achieve a fine finish. Geologically speaking, most of the gemstones traditionally carved in the West are varieties of quartz, including: chalcedony, agate, amethyst, sard, onyx, carnelian, heliotrope, jasper, and quartz in its uncoloured and transparent form, known as rock crystal. The various materials called jade have been dominant in East Asian and Mesoamerican carving. Stones typically used for buildings and large sculpture are not often used for small objects such as vessels, although this does occur. For example, in the Uruk period of Sumerian culture (4th millennium BCE) heavy vases, cups and ewers of sandstone and limestone have been found, but were not for common use, as the people of Uruk had well-developed pottery.|$|R
