50|$|When the {{airplane}} produces lift, another <b>drag</b> <b>component</b> results. Induced drag, symbolized , {{is due to}} a modification of the pressure distribution due to the trailing vortex system that accompanies the lift production. An alternative perspective on lift and drag is gained from considering the change of momentum of the airflow. The wing intercepts the airflow and forces the flow to move downward. This results in an equal and opposite force acting upward on the wing which is the lift force. The change of momentum of the airflow downward results in a reduction of the rearward momentum of the flow which {{is the result of a}} force acting forward on the airflow and applied by the wing to the air flow; an equal but opposite force acts on the wing rearward which is the induced drag. Induced drag tends to be the most important component for airplanes during take-off or landing flight. Another <b>drag</b> <b>component,</b> namely wave drag, , results from shock waves in transonic and supersonic flight speeds.

At latitudes higher than 30 ° N and altitudes 30 – 70 km, {{one can see}} northward EP-flux differences in all panels of Fig.  7 a, which decrease EP-fluxes produced by tropospheric PW sources and plotted with arrows in Fig.  6 a. They could be caused by OGW drag influence on the general circulation (see Fig.  1 b) and PW refractive index (Fig.  6 b), which modify the SPW propagation conditions in the middle atmosphere.

50|$|Wingtip {{vortices}} {{modify the}} airflow around a wing, reducing wing's {{ability to generate}} lift, so that it requires a higher angle of attack for the same lift, which tilts the total aerodynamic force rearwards and increases the <b>drag</b> <b>component</b> of that force. The angular deflection is small and has {{little effect on the}} lift. However, there is an increase in the drag equal to the product of the lift force and the angle through which it is deflected. Since the deflection is itself a function of the lift, the additional drag is proportional to the square of the lift.|$|E
5000|$|Here, {{it can be}} {{seen that}} {{increasing}} the area (S) and lift coefficient (...) allow a similar amount of lift to be generated at a lower airspeed (V).Extending the flaps also increases the drag coefficient of the aircraft. Therefore, for any given weight and airspeed, flaps increase the drag force. Flaps increase the drag coefficient of an aircraft due to higher induced drag caused by the distorted spanwise lift distribution on the wing with flaps extended. Some flaps increase the wing area and, for any given speed, this also increases the parasitic <b>drag</b> <b>component</b> of total drag.|$|E

This point is known as the [...] "center of pressure", or CoP, and is normally located somewhere between ⅓ and ½ of the way back from the leading edge. The exact location changes with changes in the angle of attack, which leads to the requirement to trim aircraft as they change their speed or power settings.|$|R
40|$|The drag {{produced}} by 2 D orographic gravity waves trapped at a temperature inversion and waves propagating in the stably stratified layer existing above are explicitly calculated using linear theory, for a two-layer atmosphere with {{neutral static stability}} near the surface, mimicking a well-mixed boundary layer. For realistic values of the flow parameters, trapped lee wave drag, which is given by a closed analytical expression, is comparable to propagating wave drag, especially in moderately to strongly non-hydrostatic conditions. In resonant flow, both <b>drag</b> <b>components</b> substantially exceed the single-layer hydrostatic drag estimate used in most parametrization schemes. Both <b>drag</b> <b>components</b> are optimally amplified for a relatively low-level inversion and Froude numbers Fr ≈ 1. While propagating wave drag is maximized for approximately hydrostatic flow, trapped lee wave drag is maximized for l_ 2 a = O(1) (where l_ 2 is the Scorer parameter in the stable layer and a is the mountain width). This roughly happens when the horizontal scale of trapped lee waves matches that of the mountain slope. The drag behavior {{as a function of}} Fr for l_ 2 H = 0. 5 (where H is the inversion height) and different values of l 2 a shows good agreement with numerical simulations. Regions of parameter space with high trapped lee wave drag correlate reasonably well with those where lee wave rotors were found to occur in previous nonlinear numerical simulations including frictional effects. This suggests that trapped lee wave drag, besides giving a relevant contribution to low-level drag exerted on the atmosphere, may also be useful to diagnose lee rotor formation...|$|R
40|$|Drag {{reduction}} for aerial vehicles has a {{range of}} positive ramifications: reduced fuel consumption, larger operational range, greater endurance and higher achievable speeds. The aerodynamic drag breakdown of a transport aircraft at cruise shows that the skin friction drag and the lift-induced drag constitute the two main sources of drag, approximately one half and {{one third of the}} total drag. The paper summarizes {{the state of the art}} in aeronautical drag reduction for the `conventional’ <b>drag</b> <b>components</b> of viscous <b>drag,</b> drag due to lift and wave drag, and also will give an overview of the results obtained for the different mentioned topics and will try to evaluate the potential gains offered by the different technologies...|$|R
50|$|Aerodynamic {{efficiency}} for {{supersonic aircraft}} increases with thin section airfoils with sharp leading and trailing edges. Swept wings where {{the leading edge}} is subsonic {{have the advantage of}} reducing the wave <b>drag</b> <b>component</b> at supersonic flight speeds; however experiments show that the theoretical benefits are not always attained due to separation of the flow over the surface of the wing; however this can be corrected with design factors. Double-Wedge and Bi-convex airfoils are the most common designs used in supersonic flights. Wave drag is the simplest and most important component of the drag in supersonic flow flight regions. For the optimized aircraft nearly 60% of its drag is skin friction drag, little over 20% is induced drag, and slightly under 20% is wave drag, hence less than 30% of the drag is due to lift.|$|E
50|$|An {{approximate}} way {{to relate}} the sound generated to the flow characteristics is to perturb the standard drag equation with velocity perturbations {{as shown in the}} upper equation below.(lift measurements for cylinders are generally not available). The upper equation is the modified drag equation with both <b>drag</b> <b>component</b> u and lift component v and the cross sectional area dL where d is the cylinder diameter and w is the length. Manipulation of the equation yields the lower two equations for the dipole sound power of both lift and drag. Each time a vortex is shed, the drag velocity fluctuation u has the same sign, but the lateral velocity fluctuation v, has opposite signs, since the vortex is shed on alternate sides. As a result, The drag dipole would be expected to be twice the frequency of the lift dipole.|$|E
50|$|This {{was another}} concept {{introduced}} by Frahm {{and used in}} several ships in the early 1900s. In this concept the two wing tanks are connected only by an air duct at the top. Water flows {{in and out of}} each tank via an opening in the hull to the sea. This eliminates the need for a crossover duct as in the other designs, but has its own set of disadvantages. This design promoted corrosion of the tanks due to the explicit interaction with sea water. The holes on the hull cause resistance to forward motion. The force required to accelerate sea water outside the ship (which is initially at rest) to the speed of the ship as it enters the ship is a substantial <b>drag</b> <b>component</b> (momentum drag) as its magnitude increases with the square of ship speed. More recently, a variation of these tanks has been used in oil drilling rig applications where forward motion is of little relevance.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The use of {{multidisciplinary}} optimization {{techniques in}} aerospace vehicle design often is limited {{because of the}} significant computational expense incurred {{in the analysis of}} the vehicle and its many systems. In response to this difficulty, a variable-complexity modeling approach, involving the use of refined and computationally expensive models together with simple and computationally inexpensive models has been developed [1]. This variable-complexity technique has been previously applied to the combined aerodynamic-structural optimization of subsonic transport aircraft wings and the aerodynamic-structural optimization of the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) [2]-[4]. In related research conducted by members of the MAD Center at Virginia Tech, convergence difficulties were encountered in the aerodynamic-structural optimization of the HSCT [5].

The objective of this paper is the additional introduction of a similarly high-quality body-boundary layer resolution by grid redistribution.

50|$|CD= CD,O + KCL2Where CDO {{is the sum}} of C(D,friction) and C D,thickness, and k for {{supersonic}} flow {{is a function of the}} Mach number. The skin-friction component is derived from the presence of a viscous boundary layer which is infinitely close to the surface of the aircraft body. At the boundary wall, the normal component of velocity is zero; therefore an infinitesimal area exists where there is no slip. The zero-lift wave <b>drag</b> <b>component</b> can be obtained based on the supersonic area rule which tells us that the wave-drag of an aircraft in a steady {{supersonic flow}} is identical to the average of a series of equivalent bodies of revolution. The bodies of revolution are defined by the cuts through the aircraft made by the tangent to the fore Mach cone from a distant point of the aircraft at an azimuthal angle. This average is over all azimuthal angles. The drag due-to lift component is calculated using lift-analysis programs. The wing design and the lift-analysis programs are separate lifting-surfaces methods that solve the direct or inverse problem of design and lift analysis.|$|E

Such metals are found,most famously, near optimal doping in the hole-doped cuprates, but also appear in numerous other correlatedelectron compounds. For strange metals in which momentum is approximately conserved, a set of hydrodynamic equations were proposed in 2007, describing two-component transportwith momentum <b>drag</b> <b>component</b> and a quantum-critical conductivity.This formulation {{was connected to the}} holography of charged black holes, memory functions, and new field-theoretic approaches. These equations are validwhen the electron-electron scattering time is much shorter than the electron-impurity scattering time,and they lead to specific predictions for the density, disorder, temperature, frequency, and magnetic field dependenceof transport properties. Strange metal behavior obeying these hydrodynamic equations was predicted in graphene, in the 'quantum critical'regime of weak disorder and moderate temperatures near the Dirac density.The theory quantitatively describes measurements of thermal and electricaltransport in graphene, and points to a regime of viscous, rather than Ohmic, electron flow.Extensions of this theory to Weyl metals pointed out the relevance of the axial-gravitational anomaly, and made predictions for thermal transport which wereconfirmed in observations (and highlighted in the New York Times).|$|E

In our implementation, we fit quadratic polynomials within variable bounds to data gathered from a series of numerical analyses of different aircraft designs. Because the HSCT optimization process contains noise and suffers from a nonconvex design space even when noise is filtered out, multiple optimization runs are performed from different starting points with and without the response surface models in order to evaluate their effectiveness. It is shown that response surface methodology facilitates design space exploration, allowing improvements in terms of both convergence performance and computational effort when multiple starting points are required...|$|R
