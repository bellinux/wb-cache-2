The systems addressed in this section are the off-gas <b>system,</b> the turbine <b>gland</b> <b>seal</b> exhaust <b>system,</b> and the mechanical vacuum pump system. The effects of hydrogen addition for hydrogen water chemistry are also addressed in this section. The off-gas system collects, contains, and processes the radioactive gases extracted from the steam condenser. The gases are exhausted by the steam jet air ejectors and flow through a preheater to a catalytic recombiner where all of the hydrogen is recombined with oxygen to form steam. All steam, from recombination booster jets and dilution is condensed for return as condensate and the noncondensible gases flow to a holdup pipe. The gas flow continues through a cooler condenser, a moisture separator, electric reheaters, a prefilter, activated charcoal adsorber vessels, high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, and then to the 310 -foot chimney for discharge to the environment. An alternate off-gas system flow path allows flow to bypass the catalytic recombiners, the activated charcoal adsorber vessels, (bypass lines around 2 A and 3 B recombiners exist but their use is not permitted by TSUP. ...|$|R

40|$|LectureFor years, {{labyrinth}} shaft-end seals {{have been}} used for centrifugal compressors handling air and nonhazardous gases, and for low suction pressure compressors in hydrocarbon service. To prevent gas leakage from the hydrocarbon machines, either injection of inert gas or jet ejector systems have been applied with the seals. The ejectors were normally arranged to exhaust back to the compressor suction. Early application of labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> were generally on compressors with suction pressures in the 0 - 8 psig range, and the <b>seal</b> <b>system</b> operation was generally satisfactory. Many of the older machines have been uprated to higher suction pressures. The labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> have been applied to newer compressors with suction pressures as high as 15 psig. Many of the systems do not perform satisfactorily, and operators complain of leakage of hydrocarbons and contamination of the lube oil. This {{may be the result of}} noncritical-flow ejectors operating with critical pressure ratios. Labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> can be designed to perform satisfactorily with the higher compressor suction pressures, but these systems often require critical-flow ejectors.

40|$|<b>Gland</b> <b>sealing</b> {{has been}} {{researched}} since the 1950 ’s by the British Hydraulic Research Association and others to improve seal performance. The literature review showed the focus had been on uniform packing compression to more closely match the packing pressure distribution to the fluid pressure {{with the objective of}} reducing leakage over time. There was limited work on the tribology of <b>gland</b> <b>sealing</b> and the patents were dominated by seal designs in a liquor environment. The review identified the particle properties of hardness, shape, fracture toughness and size as relevant to the wear and useful life of a <b>gland</b> <b>seal</b> in a slurry environment. This research presents the design, development and testing of a novel laboratory test rig which deliberately injects slurry particles into a typical standard slurry pump <b>gland</b> <b>seal</b> to cause wear of the sacrificial shaft sleeve. Mineral processing relies on slurry pumping to transfer slurry between plant operations and to improve life cycle costs and reliability in the long term a tribology approach was employed for the research. A range of mineral and synthetic particles were selected over the widest possible hardness range, tested and correlated with the output variable (specific wear rate) of the shaft sleeve. The wear of the shaft sleeve was normalised by travel distance and gland follower load. The data was combined by a novel empirical regression wear model which unified the controlling variables of load, travel distance, particle size, hardness, fracture toughness and size. Recent published values of hardness and fracture toughness were included in the analysis. A linear regression model with interactive terms between the fracture toughness, particle size and hardness, including a log term for the size, provided a good fit with statistical significance to the experimental data. Some dependency was demonstrated between the controlling variables of fracture toughness and particle size. Particle shape was found not to be relevant to the model for particle sizes less than 500 microns. A novel particle shape descriptor weighted dihedral angle which described the average dihedral angle of particle vertices, was proposed and this did not provide any more accuracy than existing descriptors such as SPQ. It was discovered during the experiments that slurry particles may form quasi particles in the seal gap depending on the geometric parameters, gap dimension and material parameters of the opposing (packing) surface, in a semi continuous process. A new tribology qualitative model for the wear of the shaft sleeve and motion of the particles in the gap is described. The relevant particle properties have also been combined into a novel dimensionless number (PDN) which was found to provide a significant correlation with the shaft sleeve SWR, and therefore has the potential to {{serve as the basis for}} future research investigation in three body wear.
