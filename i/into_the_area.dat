This, coupled with {{a substantial increase in}} people moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> has led to a sharp rise in the resident population since 2001. Of the total population, 3.3% are 85 or over, compared to 2.2% nationally; however the largest group of people moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>area</b> are students in the 16-24-year age group, and 9% of the current population are between 20 and 24.
