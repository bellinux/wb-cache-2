5|$|By the 1951 season, Motley {{started to}} feel the {{physical}} effects of his hard-hitting, up-the-middle running style. He suffered a knee injury in training camp, and he was getting older; {{by the time the}} season was in <b>full</b> <b>swing,</b> he was 31. Motley only ran for 273 yards and one touchdown that year, an uncharacteristically low total. Despite Motley's troubles, the Browns made the championship game again after winning the American Conference with an 11–1 record. Cleveland, however, lost the title game to the Rams, 24–17. Motley had just five carries and 23 yards.|$|E

30|$|This number also {{indicates}} {{how many times}} the swing leg swings until it lands in each step [8]. Each leg is allowed to swing for T_b/ 2 during each step. The largest step is obtained if the swing leg lands on the ground, T_l/ 2 after it has started to swing. Therefore, the condition for the largest step is T_b/ 2 = T_l/ 2, or r_p = 1. When r_p = 2, T_b/ 2 is equal to T_l. In this case, the stride becomes zero because T_l is the period of <b>full</b> leg <b>swing,</b> {{which means that the}} swing leg lands on the ground at the same place as it is lifted up. When r_p = 3, T_b/ 2 is equal to (1 + 1 / 2) T_l, which indicates that the swing leg <b>swings</b> one <b>full</b> forward <b>swing,</b> one <b>full</b> backward <b>swing,</b> and one more <b>full</b> forward <b>swing.</b> This period ratio also maximizes the stride but it has unnecessary leg swings, compared to the gait for r_p = 1. Similarly, any odd integer numbers of r_p can realize the maximum step length, but as r_p becomes larger, the gait contains more unnecessary leg swings. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} period ratio of 1 realizes the ideal walking.|$|R

In two years they produced gold worth $190,000 ($ in modern dollars), funding the construction of a stamping mill and sawmill. In Aspen, further down the valley, silver was found in even greater abundance than Independence's gold. B.

5|$|With {{the dawn}} of the Haitian Revolution in 1791, a {{successful}} slave rebellion on the French colony, then known as Saint-Domingue, allowed the local population to gain control over the government. Despite their success in removing the French colonial authorities, the various political factions that had seized control of the colony were fractious, and fighting soon broke out among them. By 1800, the War of Knives between the pro-French André Rigaud and the pro-autonomy Toussaint L'Ouverture was in <b>full</b> <b>swing</b> and Saint-Domingue was divided in two. Rigaud controlled part of the southern portion of Saint-Domingue while L'Ouverture controlled the rest of the French colony.

5|$|Hagiographic {{accounts}} of Harding's life quickly followed his death, such as Joe Mitchell Chapple's Life and Times of Warren G. Harding, Our After-War President (1924). By then, the scandals were breaking, and the Harding administration {{soon became a}} byword for corruption {{in the view of}} the public. Works written in the late 1920s helped shape Harding's historical reputation: Masks in a Pageant by William Allen White mocked and dismissed Harding, as did Samuel Hopkins Adams' fictionalized account of the Harding administration, Revelry. These books depicted Harding's time in office as one of great presidential weakness. The publication of Nan Britton's bestselling book disclosing they had had an affair also lowered the late president in public esteem. President Coolidge, not wishing to be further associated with his predecessor, refused to dedicate the Harding Tomb. Hoover, Coolidge's successor, was similarly reluctant, but with Coolidge in attendance presided over the dedication in 1931. By that time, with the Great Depression in <b>full</b> <b>swing,</b> Hoover was nearly as discredited as Harding.|$|E

50|$|As Grout saw it, his Six Fundamentals were a base {{on which}} to build an {{outstanding}} swing. He felt strongly that the absolute first thing you must have is a Good Grip on the club; a grip that will naturally - unconsciously - deliver the club face square to the target at impact. Second, Set Up Correctly because that important maneuver determines how you will swing the club. Third, maintain a Steady Head position throughout the swing. His fourth fundamental was Proper Footwork because it promotes both good balance and <b>full</b> <b>swinging.</b> The basis of footwork is rolling your ankles correctly while keeping your knees flexed at all times. Fundamental 5 called for Full Extension. A golfer should try to develop the widest possible arc by making a full shoulder turn and fully extending his arms on the backswing and downswing. Grout's sixth fundamental was the importance of having Quiet Hands {{at the start of the}} downswing. While the feet actually initiate the downswing, the arms -- not the hands -- must swing the club through the ball. Asked about putting, later in his career, Grout stated that, if he had it to do over, he would have taught Nicklaus to putt cross-handed. Nicklaus later quoted Grout and said that golfers new to the game should learn to putt left hand low (right handed golfers).|$|R
5|$|The French {{started their}} {{evacuation}} with their pre-conceived notion that few {{would want to}} head south. As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist-controlled north, thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum-seekers descended on the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, {{both of which were}} still in French control. This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter, food, medicine and places on the ships and planes that were bound for the south. By early August, there were over 200,000evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong. Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation and water quality control, leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen. The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into <b>full</b> <b>swing,</b> and did not improve significantly for a month. There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and immunisation of the waiting evacuees. The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps and said that the lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees would be even worse in the south, where they would be completely under the control of South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1260s, John {{returned}} to Europe, {{and there is}} evidence of his activity in Macedonia and Thessaly. He had estates in the valley of the river Strymon in Macedonia, and is attested in documents concerning the properties of monasteries in eastern Thessaly, which the Byzantines had probably recovered by that time, following the death of Michael II of Epirus in 1267/1268. John Doukas of Thessaly, however, remained one of the Empire's chief opponents, and Michael Palaiologos organized a campaign (variously dated to 1272/1273 or 1274/1275) to finally subdue him. It was a large-scale undertaking: an army of some 30,000 men, mostly mercenaries, was placed under the command of John Palaiologos and Alexios Kaballarios, while the land forces were to be aided by a fleet of over 70 vessels under Alexios Philanthropenos. The campaign was initially crowned with success, as the Byzantine army advanced quickly through Thessaly and besieged John Doukas at his capital Neopatras. The latter, however, was able to escape in secret, procure aid from the Duchy of Athens, and utterly defeat the besieging Byzantine army at the Battle of Neopatras. With his forces scattered, John Palaiologos retreated to the north; on his way, he learned of an attack by the Latin fleet on the Byzantine navy at Demetrias. Assembling whatever men he could find, the despotes led his troops in a forty-mile ride, through the night, towards Demetrias. There they encountered the battle in <b>full</b> <b>swing,</b> and the Latins having the advantage.
