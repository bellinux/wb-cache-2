25|$|As {{the first}} line of defense, {{healthcare}} systems and workers are particularly vulnerable.

25|$|Techniques {{of public}} <b>health</b> <b>surveillance</b> {{have been used}} in {{particular}} to study infectious diseases. Many large institutions, such as the WHO and the CDC, have created databases and modern computer systems (public health informatics) that can track and monitor emerging outbreaks of illnesses such as influenza, SARS, HIV, and even bioterrorism, such as the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Today the DoDSR {{is among}} the largest serum {{repositories}} in the world, in terms of numbers of individuals represented, number of longitudinal specimens stored per individual, and total quantity of serum. The majority of specimens are linked to detailed medical and personnel data, creating a valuable resource for retrospective research and public <b>health</b> <b>surveillance.</b> The DoDSR's longitudinal serum, collected systematically from a large population, has enabled major contributions to understanding the etiology of many health conditions not otherwise amenable to prospective study, including multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, autoimmune diseases and cancer.|$|E

25|$|Public <b>Health</b> <b>{{surveillance}}</b> {{systems can}} be passive or active. A passive surveillance system consists of the regular, ongoing reporting of diseases and conditions by all health facilities in a given territory. An active surveillance system is one where health facilities are visited and health care providers and medical records are reviewed {{in order to identify}} a specific disease or condition. Passive surveillance systems are less time consuming and less expensive to run but risk under-reporting of some diseases. Active surveillance systems are most appropriate for epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination.|$|E

25|$|WHO has the {{broadest}} health mandate under the UN system, including setting priorities, coordinating global <b>health</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and emergency {{assistance in the}} event of disease outbreaks. Health experts give WHO credit for major successes, such as the eradication of smallpox, near eradication of polio, and substantial progress in controlling childhood diseases, and in expanding primary health care in developing countries. WHO defenders blame continued member state parsimony that has kept WHO's regular biennial budget to roughly $850 million for several years and forced it to rely more on voluntary contributions that often come with strings attached as the cause of its shortcomings. This situation led to lack of focus at the top level as well as overly optimistic forecasts.|$|E
25|$|People {{who work}} with poultry and swine, {{especially}} those with intense exposures, {{are at increased risk}} of zoonotic infection with influenza virus endemic in these animals, and constitute a population of human hosts in which zoonosis and reassortment can co-occur. Vaccination of these workers against influenza and surveillance for new influenza strains among this population may therefore be an important public health measure. Transmission of influenza from swine to humans {{who work with}} swine was documented in a small surveillance study performed in 2004 at the University of Iowa. This study, among others, forms the basis of a recommendation that people whose jobs involve handling poultry and swine be the focus of increased public <b>health</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Other professions at particular risk of infection are veterinarians and meat processing workers, although the risk of infection for both of these groups is lower than that of farm workers.|$|E

2500|$|Prompted by {{experiences}} {{in the aftermath of}} the Persian Gulf War, including claims by many service members of adverse health outcomes, the December, 1995 deployment of U.S. service members to Bosnia was accompanied by increased emphasis on <b>health</b> <b>surveillance.</b> A 1996 Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs memorandum [...] mandated the collection of pre- and post-deployment serum specimens from deploying service members, and their integration into the DoDSR. The policy also directed that specimens collected for HIV surveillance could suffice. Although a small number of specimens were collected directly for <b>health</b> <b>surveillance</b> outside of existing HIV testing channels, specimens collected in this manner suffered from lack of standardization. By 1999, the Assistant Secretary of Defense issued modified instructions, which directed that the requirement for pre- and post-deployment specimens be satisfied by HIV testing. Initially, an HIV specimen was required to be collected prior to deployment if none had been collected in the year prior.|$|E

The use of connection tracking works to record every connection between devices in a monitored network. There may be advantages in connection tracking techniques as they avoid sampling, produce more data in real time and put less load on the functioning of networks.|$|R
