These were made from “geometric backed” blades that were hafted together with heated ochre and <b>gum</b> <b>compound</b> glue. [...] These blades are sometimes called segments, crescents, lunates or microliths are the type fossils for identifying a technology as Howiesons Poort. Blades from the Howiesons Poort assemblages were produced by soft hammer percussion on marginal platforms and the backed tools of this industry subsequently fashioned from these flakes. Organic residues preserved on the tips of these stone tools show not only that they were hafted but also that they were used as hunting weapons. Sarah Wurz's study shows that the general assemblage, frequency of retouch pieces, and the variability in formal tool morphologies {{still need to be}} looked into further. Meanwhile, Harper's study at Rose Cottage contain a confusion concerning the backed pieces and laterally crested blades ...|$|E

40|$|A journal {{review of}} gums of {{industrial}} value. There {{is an increasing}} trend towards the use of available plant resources for food and technological applications. One class of ingredients often exploited for their texturizing capabilities are the plant polysaccharides called the hydrocolloids or <b>gums.</b> These <b>compounds</b> are long chain polymers which dissolve in water to give a thickening or viscosity-building effect. Some of these plant polysaccharides have found applications in the food, pharmaceutical, textile, mining and other industries. The United States Food and Drug Administration regulates <b>gums,</b> classifying these <b>compounds</b> as food additives. Though required at usage levels of less than two percent to achieve the desired properties in food systems, gums have become a big business. In 1991 the market of gums reached 126 metric tons at a worth of $ 748. 7 million. There is an increased awareness of the nutritional importance of polysaccharides. The demand for water-soluble polysaccharide gums including the seaweed extracts, seed gums, plant exudates and cellulose derivatives, has slowly increased {{over the past few}} years along with population growth and the advent of easy to prepare foods. Effective use of gums requires that their chemical and physical properties be understood as much as possible. This article gives a review of some of the polysaccharide gums of industrial value...|$|R

Theeffect of these xanthates with zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (ZDC) on the vulcaniza-tion of HAF filled NR compound {{has been studied}} at different temperatures. The rubber compounds with the three xanthate accelerators and ZDC were cured at various temperatures from 60 °C to 150 °C. The sheets were moulded and properties such as ten-sile strength, tear strength, cross-link density, elongation-at-break, compression set, heat build up, abrasion resistance, flex resistance, etc. were evaluated. The properties showed that zinc xanthate/ZDC accelerator combination has a positive synergistic effect on the mechanical properties of NR compounds. The curing of HAF filled NR compound containing zinc xanthate/ZDC is slightly slower than the curing of the corresponding gum compounds.

40|$|Dynamic {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} natural rubber and its composites reinforced with short coir fibers has been studied. Maxima in tan delta, E" {{and the middle}} point of E' vs. temperature curves of the <b>gum</b> natural rubber <b>compound</b> at different frequencies almost coincide with one another. But the maxima in tan delta and E" do not coincide {{in the case of}} composites. It is observed that as frequency increases the values of tan delta and E" decrease whereas the values of El increase in the case of both gum and the composites. The values of E" and tan delta increase with fiber incorporation, which indicates lower heat dissipation in the gum. Two prominent peaks are observed in the tan delta vs. temperature curve of these composites due to the dynamic mechanical behavior of matrix and fiber. The additional small peak represents the dynamic mechanical behavior at the interface. The effect of chemical treatment of coir fiber on damping of composites was studied and it was found that composite with poor interfacial bonding tend to dissipate more energy than that with good interfacial bonding.

Yeast strains were identified by traditional methods. Identifications were confirmed by sequencing of ribosomal DNA in case of doubt. In total 14 yeast species of ascomycetous affiliation and 6 anamorphic basidiomycetous yeasts were isolated and identified. Most species were represented by only one strain, but Candida bertae by two and Trichosporon porosum by six strains, all from different wood samples. Three strains represented novel species, one of which is described as Cryptococcus fagi Middelhoven et Scorzetti. The type strain is CBS 9964 (JCM 13614). All strains were tested for growth on several polysaccharides as sole carbon source. Only some of these polymers supported growth of ascomycetous yeasts. Basidiomycetous yeasts assimilated soluble starch, pullulan, dextran, xylan, polygalacturonate, galactomannan and tannic acid or at least some of these.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this randomized, {{cross-over}} in situ {{study was to determine}} the effects of 4 chewing gums on artificial caries-like subsurface lesions. Two chewing gums (1 with zinc citrate and 1 without) contained dicalcium phosphate (3. 9 %), calcium gluconate (1. 8 %) and calcium lactate (0. 45 %), 1 chewing gum contained casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate nanocomplexes (0. 7 %), and another one contained no calcium. Fifteen subjects without current caries activity (7 male, 8 female; mean age: 27. 5 +/- 2. 5 years) wore removable buccal appliances in the lower jaw with 4 bovine enamel slabs with subsurface lesions. The appliances were inserted immediately before gum chewing for 20 min and then retained for an additional 20 min. This was performed 4 times per day. Every subject chewed 4 different chewing gums over 4 periods of 14 days each. During a fifth period (control) the subjects only wore the appliances without chewing gum. At completion of each period the enamel slabs were embedded, sectioned and subjected to transversal microradiography. With regard to change of mineral loss and of lesion depth no significant differences could be found between chewing gums containing calcium and calcium-free chewing gums. Moreover, the chewing gum groups and the control group did not differ significantly if adjustments were made for baseline values (p > 0. 05; ANCOVA). Under the conditions of the present study it may be concluded that the use of chewing gum offers no additional remineralizing benefit to buccal tooth surfaces, even if the chewing <b>gum</b> contains calcium <b>compounds...</b>|$|R
40|$|The use {{of olive}} oil in several food {{products}} as been increasing {{in the past few}} years due to its healthy fatty acid composition, content of phenolic compounds and appreciated flavour. The addition of natural phenolic compounds in foods is also an interesting issue for researchers and food industry, as several challenges have to be addressed, such as lipid oxidation and the effects on the physical stability over storage. Usually, emulsions used as sauce or dressing creams are not formulated with olive oil, mainly due to its price, but its use is interesting for some niche markets. With specific regard to olive oil, there is usually the aim is to preserve its characteristics and its appreciated flavour, both in terms of aroma and taste. However, little is known about the possible interaction of constituent phenolic compounds of virgin olive oil on the emulsions properties, both in terms of physical stability and oxidation rate, but also for its impact on aroma release. The present thesis deals with the use {{of olive oil}} as fat phase in mode oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions, with also the addition of phenolic compounds extracted and recovered from olive mill wastewater. Indeed, the presence of valuable phenolic compounds also in the by-products of olive oil extraction, i. e. olive mill wastewater, is of great importance in terms of environmental sustainability for its high pollutant risk, but it is also interesting for the recovery and application of these biophenols to be further used in food products to design functional foods. Moreover, olive phenolic compounds have been shown to protect some key aroma compounds in virgin olive oils, with consequent impact on the headspace aroma release was demonstrated. The effect of ingredient interactions on the release of aroma compounds and therefore on the final aroma and flavour of the product was also addressed in the present thesis. The first chapter presents an overview of the most up-to-date researches on olive oil chemistry and flavour, on food emulsions characterisation and on the emulsion destabilisation phenomena. The interaction of emulsion ingredients, particularly phenolic compounds and proteins (especially milk proteins) has been detailed, with emphasis on their effect on emulsion stability and on aroma compounds. The principle of “molecular gastronomy”, i. e. the use of new ingredients but also the application of an uncommon combination of ingredient in a food product must be studied to assess the final flavour effect, based on the food pairing theory, has been detailed. Being the study of aroma release particularly important, the latest research papers about food aroma release and model systems simulating mouth conditions, also regarding the interaction of phenolics and proteins, have been reviewed. The third chapter presents an experimental study where a model olive O/W emulsion has been created by using refined olive oil and the following ingredients: olive mill wastewater phenolic extracts, whey protein isolate, xanthan <b>gum.</b> The phenolic <b>compounds</b> extracts were added to create a functional food product with possibly effect on the lipid oxidation status and potential human health benefits, but the effects on physical stability should be also studied. For this reason, the creaming rate, mean particle size, particle size distribution and other physical properties were assessed and reported in order to verify the effects of the hydrocolloid, proteins and phenolic added. A mathematical model has been then created and presented in chapter four to study the emulsion behaviour by means the response surface methodology to better describe the effect and interaction of these ingredients. Not discrete concentrations but ranges were used for each of the compound in the same emulsions system, by using the statistical design known as central composite design. The model performance and the full description of the emulsions was reported and discussed. Finally, in chapter five the headspace aroma release from emulsions/dispersions was the object of the study. Dispersed systems were created by using olive oil with added olive phenolic compounds and whey protein isolate. Their effect on the aroma release was studied by solid-space micro-extraction and analysed using gas-chromatography coupled with mass-spectroscopy. Moreover, a retronasal aroma simulator system was applied in order to evaluate the possible retronasal release in vitro. This system used human saliva and therefore also the effects of salivary proteins and other components on the mixture was studied, in relation to the release of olive oil aroma compounds...|$|R
6000|$|Five hours (and {{who can do}} it less in?) By haughty Celia {{spent in}} dressing; The goddess from her chamber issues, Array'd in lace, brocades, and tissues. [...] Strephon, who found the room was void, And Betty {{otherwise}} employ'd, Stole in, and took a strict survey Of all the litter as it lay: Whereof, to make the matter clear, An inventory follows here. [...] And, first, a dirty smock appear'd, Beneath the arm-pits well besmear'd; Strephon, the rogue, display'd it wide, And turn'd it round on ev'ry side: On such a point, few words are best, And Strephon bids us guess the rest; But swears, how damnably the men lie In calling Celia sweet and cleanly. [...] Now listen, while he next produces The various combs for various uses; Fill'd up with dirt so closely fixt, No brush could force a way betwixt; A paste of composition rare, Sweat, dandriff, powder, lead, and hair: A fore-head cloth with oil upon't, To smooth the wrinkles on her front: Here alum-flour, to stop the steams Exhaled from sour unsavoury streams: There night-gloves made of Tripsey's hide, [1]Bequeath'd by Tripsey when she died; With puppy-water, beauty's help, Distil'd from Tripsey's darling whelp. Here gallipots and vials placed, Some fill'd with washes, some with paste; Some with pomatums, paints, and slops, And ointments good for scabby chops. Hard by a filthy bason stands, Foul'd with the scouring of her hands: The bason takes whatever comes, The scrapings from her teeth and <b>gums,</b> A nasty <b>compound</b> of all hues, For here she spits, and here she spues. [...] But, oh! it turn'd poor Strephon's bowels When he beheld and smelt the towels, Begumm'd, bematter'd, and beslim'd, With dirt, and sweat, and ear-wax grim'd; No object Strephon's eye escapes; Here petticoats in frouzy heaps; Nor be the handkerchiefs forgot, All varnish'd o'er with snuff and snot. The stockings why should I expose, Stain'd with the moisture of her toes,[2] Or greasy coifs, and pinners reeking, Which Celia slept {{at least a week}} in? A pair of tweezers next he found, To pluck her brows in arches round; Or hairs that sink the forehead low, Or on her chin like bristles grow. [...] The virtues we must not let pass Of Celia's magnifying glass; When frighted Strephon cast his eye on't, It shew'd the visage of a giant: A glass that can to sight disclose The smallest worm in Celia's nose, And faithfully direct her nail To squeeze it out from head to tail; For, catch it nicely by the head, It must come out, alive or dead. [...] Why, Strephon, will you tell the rest? And must you needs describe the chest? That careless wench! no creature warn her To move it out from yonder corner! But leave it standing full in sight, For you to exercise your spight? In vain the workman shew'd his wit, With rings and hinges counterfeit, To make it seem in this disguise A cabinet to vulgar eyes: Which Strephon ventur'd to look in, Resolved to go thro' thick and thin. He lifts the lid: there needs no more, He smelt it all the time before. [...] As, from within Pandora's box, When Epimetheus op'd the locks, A sudden universal crew Of human evils upward flew; He still was comforted to find That hope at last remain'd behind: So Strephon, lifting up the lid, To view what in the chest was hid, The vapours flew from up the vent; But Strephon, cautious, never meant The bottom of the pan to grope, And foul his hands in search of hope. O! ne'er may such a vile machine Be once in Celia's chamber seen! O! may she better learn to keep Those [...] "secrets of the hoary deep." [...] [3] [...] As mutton-cutlets, prime of meat, Which, tho' with art you salt and beat, As laws of cookery require, And toast them at the clearest fire; If from upon the hopeful chops The fat upon a cinder drops, To stinking smoke it turns the flame, Pois'ning the flesh from whence it came, And up exhales a greasy stench, For which you curse the careless wench: So things which must not be exprest, When drop'd into the reeking chest, Send up an excremental smell To taint the part from whence they fell: The petticoats and gown perfume, And waft a stink round ev'ry room. [...] Thus finishing his grand survey, Disgusted Strephon slunk away; Repeating in his amorous fits, [...] "Oh! Celia, Celia, Celia sh--!" [...] But Vengeance, goddess never sleeping, Soon punish'd Strephon for his peeping: His foul imagination links Each dame he sees with all her stinks; And, if unsavoury odours fly, Conceives a lady standing by. All women his description fits, And both ideas jump like wits; By vicious fancy coupled fast, And still appearing in contrast. [...] I pity wretched Strephon, blind To all the charms of woman kind. Should I the Queen of Love refuse, Because she rose from stinking ooze? To him that looks behind the scene, Statira's but some pocky quean. [...] When Celia in her glory shews, If Strephon would but stop his nose, (Who now so impiously blasphemes Her ointments, daubs, and paints, and creams, Her washes, slops, and every clout, With which he makes so foul a rout;) He soon would learn to think like me, And bless his ravish'd sight to see Such order from confusion sprung, Such gaudy tulips raised from dung.|$|R
