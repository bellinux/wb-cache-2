40|$|Purpose – Consumer {{confidence}} in the European food industry has been shaken {{by a number of}} recent scandals due to food fraud and accidental contamination, reminding the authors that deliberate incidents can occur. <b>Food</b> <b>defence</b> methods aim to prevent or mitigate deliberate attacks on the food supply chain but are not a legal requirement. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to discuss how proactive and reactive <b>food</b> <b>defence</b> practices can help prevent or mitigate malicious attacks on the food chain and also food fraud, food crime and food safety. The authors look at how <b>food</b> <b>defence</b> differs from food safety and how it contributes to food supply chain integrity. Design/methodology/approach – <b>Food</b> <b>defence</b> has been the focus of two different EU FP 7 security projects, EDEN and SNIFFER. Food industry stakeholders participated in workshops and demonstrations on <b>food</b> <b>defence</b> and relevant technology was tested in different food production scenarios. Findings – Food industry end-users reported a lack of knowledge regarding <b>food</b> <b>defence</b> practices. They wished for further guidelines and training on risk assessment as well as access to validated test methods. Novel detection tools and methods showed promise with authentication, identification, measurement, assessment and control at multiple levels of the food supply chain prior to distribution and retail. Practical implications – The prevention of a contamination incident, prior to retail, costs less than dealing with a large foodborne disease outbreak. <b>Food</b> <b>defence</b> should therefore be integral to food supply chain integrity and not just an afterthought in the wake of an incident. Originality/value – It is argued that <b>food</b> <b>defence</b> practices have a vital role to play across the board in unintentional and intentional food contamination incidents. The application of these methods can help ensure food supply chain integrity.

40|$|This {{research}} updates previous {{inventories of}} malicious attacks {{on food and}} water to include data from 1946 through mid- 2015. A systematic search of news reports, databases and previous inventories of poisoning events was undertaken. Incidents that threatened or were intended to achieve direct harm to humans, and that were either relatively large (number of victims > 4 or indiscriminate in intent or realisation were included. Agents could be chemical, biological or radio-nuclear. Reports of candidate incidents were subjected to systematic inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as validity analysis (not always clearly undertaken in previous inventories of such attacks). We summarise contextual aspects of the attacks that may be important for scenario prioritisation, modelling and defensive preparedness. Opportunity is key to most realised attacks, particularly access to dangerous agents. The most common motives and relative success rate in causing harm were very different between food and water attacks. The likelihood that people were made ill or died also varied by food/water mode, and according to motive and opportunity for delivery of the hazardous agent. Deaths and illness associated with attacks during food manufacture and prior to sale have been fewer than those in some other contexts. Valuable opportunities for <b>food</b> <b>defence</b> improvements are identified in other contexts, especially food prepared in private or community settings...|$|E
40|$|The HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) {{system is}} still {{recognised}} internationally {{as the most}} effective way to produce safe food throughout the supply chain, but a HACCP system cannot operate in a vacuum. It requires prerequisite programmes to be in place and it can be highly affected by, or dependent upon, other major considerations such as animal, plant, human and environmental health, food security and <b>food</b> <b>defence.</b> This book: * Provides a practical and up-to-date text covering the essentials of food safety management in the global supply chain, giving the reader the knowledge and skills that they need to design, implement and maintain a world-class food safety programme. * Builds on existing texts on HACCP and food safety, taking the next step forward in the evolution of HACCP and providing a text that is relevant to all sectors and sizes of food businesses throughout the world. * Shares practical food safety experience, allowing development of best-practice approaches. This will allow existing businesses to improve their systems and enable businesses that are new to HACCP and food safety management requirements in both developed and developing countries to build on existing knowledge for more rapid application of world-class food safety systems. * Educates practitioners such that they will be able to use their judgement in decision-making and to influence those who make food policy and manage food operations. This book is an essential resource for all scientists and managers in the food industry (manufacturing and foodservice); regulators and educators in the field of food safety; and students of food science and technology...|$|E
