5|$|Escape from New York (1981): The {{director}} {{drew from}} {{the concepts of}} gang warfare {{and the experience of}} being walled-in. Rhona Mitra's character has an <b>eye</b> <b>patch</b> like Snake Plissken, though the director sought to create a plot point for the eye of Mitra's character to reinforce its inclusion.|$|E
5|$|Type C is the {{smallest}} type and lives in larger groups than the others. Its <b>eye</b> <b>patch</b> is distinctively slanted forwards, rather than parallel to the body axis. Like type B, it is primarily white and medium gray, with a dark gray dorsal cape and yellow-tinged patches. Its only observed prey is the Antarctic cod.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the Bohemian waxwing {{overlaps}} those of both {{the other members of}} the genus. The cedar waxwing is smaller than the Bohemian; it has browner upperparts, a white undertail and a white line above the black <b>eye</b> <b>patch.</b> Adult cedar waxwings have a yellowish belly, and all ages have less strongly patterned wings than the Bohemian waxwing. The Japanese waxwing is easily distinguished from its relatives; it has a red terminal band to the tail, the black mask extends up the rear of the crest, and there is no yellow stripe or red tips on the wings.|$|E
50|$|Sexes are similar, but immatures are browner {{than adults}} and lack the red <b>eye</b> <b>patches.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>patching</b> (monocular {{or right}} hemifield) has been {{proposed}} to improve visuospatial attention to the ignored field in patients with neglect. The aim {{of this paper is}} to review the literature on the effects of <b>eye</b> <b>patching</b> in hemispatial neglect after stroke in order to convey evidence-based recommendations to clinicians in stroke rehabilitation. Thirteen intervention studies were selected from the Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsychINFO, EBRSR and Health Star databases. Methodological quality was defined according to the Physiotherapy Evidence Database. Overall, seven studies used monocular <b>eye</b> <b>patching,</b> five used right hemifield patching and one compared right monocular with right hemifield patching. Seven studies compared normal viewing to monocular or hemifield patching conditions. Six studies included a period of treatment. Three studies included follow-up evaluations. As to the monocular <b>eye</b> <b>patching,</b> four studies reported positive effects of right monocular patching. One study showed an improvement in hemispatial neglect with left monocular patching. Two studies found no superiority of right versus left monocular patching. One study found no effects of right monocular patching. As to the right hemifield <b>eye</b> <b>patching,</b> one study showed improvements in neglect after right hemifield patching. Three studies found that right hemifield patching combined with another rehabilitation technique was more effective than that treatment alone. One study found no differences between right hemifield patching combined with another treatment and that treatment alone. One study found the same effect between right hemifield patching alone and another rehabilitation technique. Our results globally tend to support the usefulness of right hemifield <b>eye</b> <b>patching</b> in clinical practice. In order to define a level of evidence with the standard rehabilitation evidence rating tools, further properly powered randomized controlled trials or meta-analysis are needed...|$|R

5|$|Type D was {{identified}} based on photographs of a 1955 mass stranding in New Zealand and six at-sea sightings since 2004. The first video record {{of this type}} in life happened between the Kerguelen and Crozet Islands in 2014. It is immediately recognizable by its extremely small white <b>eye</b> <b>patch,</b> narrower and shorter than usual dorsal fin, bulbous head (similar to a pilot whale), and smaller teeth. Its geographic range appears to be circumglobal in subantarctic waters between latitudes 40°S and 60°S. And although nothing {{is known about the}} type D diet, it is suspected to include fish because groups have been photographed around longline vessels, where they reportedly prey on Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides).|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} {{controls}} Scarygirl, {{a young girl}} with an <b>eye</b> <b>patch,</b> a sewn-shut mouth and a hook-capped tentacle for one arm. The girl, an orphan, was raised and cared for by Blister, an intelligent, mustached octopus that built the girl a tree house to live in. Plagued by recurring nightmares that featured a mysterious man, the girl consults Bunnyguru, a rabbit that lives {{in the bottom of}} the tree where the girl makes her home. Bunniguru offers a vision of a city far away from the girl's home. The girl is then sent by Blister into a forest to investigate why the Tree of Life is losing its leaves, where she discovers that one of the keepers of the forest has been kidnapped and taken to the city from Bunnyguru's vision, and becomes tasked with seeing to the keeper of the forest's safe return.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an <b>eye</b> <b>patch</b> is not because he got glitter in his eye, as he told his friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>patching</b> {{is used in}} the {{orthoptic}} {{management of}} children at risk of lazy eye (amblyopia), especially strabismic or anisometropic amblyopia. [...] These conditions can cause visual suppression of areas of the dissimilar images by the brain such as to avoid diplopia, resulting in a loss of visual acuity in the suppressed eye and in extreme cases in blindness in an otherwise functional <b>eye.</b> <b>Patching</b> the good <b>eye</b> forces the amblyopic eye to function, thereby causing vision in that eye to be retained. It is important to perform “near activities” (such as reading or handiwork) when patched, thereby exercising active, attentive vision.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{treatment}} varies {{depending on}} how bad eye alignment is and also {{the underlying causes of}} strabismus. Treatment for strabismus may include orthoptics a term used for eye muscle training, this treatment can be provided by orthoptists and also optometrists. Other treatment may include wearing <b>eye</b> <b>patches</b> aimed at strengthening the weaker eye while inhibiting the stronger eye, an alternative to <b>eye</b> <b>patches</b> is the use of an opaque lens, other treatments may include eye drops to temporarily inhibit the stronger eye and at any age eye muscle surgery can be done to correct the muscular balance of the ocular muscles.|$|R
40|$|Neglect {{behavior}} of experimental animals with unilateral posterior cortical lesions improves with {{the placement of}} a second lesion in the contralesional superior colliculus or in the intercollicular commissure. Given that the retinotectal fibers are mainly crossed, it has been speculated that ipsilesional <b>eye</b> <b>patching,</b> by depriving the contralesional superior colliculus of its main facilitatory visual input, might achieve similar results, and thus {{be used as a}} remediation maneuver in patients with neglect. From six patients with severe persistent neglect, only one showed an unequivocal beneficial effect from ipsilesional <b>eye</b> <b>patching.</b> We discuss the factors which possibly underlie success and failure with this procedure, and the place for it in neglect rehabilitation...|$|R

The director began with an omniscient vantage point, transited to the intact viewpoint of the doctor's wife, and changed again to the Man with the Black <b>Eye</b> <b>Patch,</b> who connects the quarantined {{to the outside world}} with stories.
