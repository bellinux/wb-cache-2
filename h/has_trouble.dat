After six miscarriages, Henry wishes to save Clare further pain and has a vasectomy. However a version of Henry from the past visits Clare one night and they make love; she subsequently gives birth to a daughter, Alba. Alba is diagnosed with Chrono-Impairment as well but, unlike Henry, she has some control over her destinations when she time travels. Before she is born, Henry travels to the future and meets his ten-year-old daughter on a school field trip and learns that he dies when she is five years old.|$|E

To use a pump, the man inserts his penis into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the penis, making it erect. He then slides a ring from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the penis to hold the blood in and maintain the erection. A man who is able to get an erection but <b>has</b> <b>trouble</b> maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself.

40|$|Medicare {{provides}} {{health care}} coverage for approximately 93 % of non-institutionalized older adults. Compared to uninsured adults, Medicare beneficiaries have greater access to needed healthcare including preventative care. However, disparities in accessing needed health care still exist among Medicare beneficiaries. Prior research has described barriers to accessing needed health care among older Medicare beneficiaries, such as transportation and health system characteristics, but {{little is known about}} prevalence, risks, or health consequences of older Medicare beneficiaries delaying, forgoing, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed health care. The three studies included in this dissertation followed a nationally representative sample of older Medicare beneficiaries to describe the phenomenon of older adults delaying, forgoing, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> getting needed care. ^ Study 1 described the prevalence and risks of Medicare beneficiaries forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> getting needed medical care. Estimates of the prevalence and risks for forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed care were estimated separately for five years beginning with 2006 and ending in 2010 using the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS). A meta-analysis was conducted to determine overall effect sizes for the five years of data. Study results revealed that about one in every nine older Medicare beneficiaries reported forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed health care. Beneficiaries most likely to report going without or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> getting needed care {{were more likely to be}} of minority status, younger, female, more educated, live in a non-metropolitan area, have a lower annual income, have no supplementary insurance, be in poorer health, and have multiple chronic conditions or disabilities. This study confirmed that disparities in accessing needed care exist among Medicare beneficiaries. The study findings also revealed that those most likely to delay, forgo, or <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed care are among the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries due to their multiple chronic conditions or disabilities. ^ The second study examined whether reports of forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed health care was prognostic of receiving an influenza vaccination in the following year. This study followed the 2006 -cohort and 2007 -cohort from the 2007 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey to determine if receipt of the influenza vaccination in 2008 was associated with forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed health care. Nearly one in every four older Medicare beneficiaries reported not receiving an influenza vaccination. Those who reported forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed health care were significantly less likely (OR = 0. 749; 95 % CI = 0. 609, 0. 922) to receive an influenza vaccination the following year. Findings suggest that forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed healthcare increases risk for vaccination non-compliance; which in turn can increase risk for experiencing adverse health outcomes associated with influenza. The results of this study suggest that more proactive measures may be needed to increase vaccination rates among older adults who forgo, delay, or <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed health care. ^ Study 3 examined whether reports of forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed care were prognostic of hospital admissions among older Medicare beneficiaries. Number and length of hospital admissions in 2010 were determined for respondents to the 2009 MCBS survey. Results revealed that forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed care was not prognostic (Hazards Ratio = 0. 905; 95 % CI = 0. 722, 1. 134) of future hospital admissions after adjusting for other risk factors associated with hospitalizations. Findings suggest that there may be potential confounding between forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed health care and hospital admissions. Further work should be considered to examine potential confounders and/or other health outcomes. ^ The three studies in this dissertation improve our understanding of the prevalence, risks, and consequences of older Medicare beneficiaries forgoing, delaying, or <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> accessing needed health care. The findings will inform the importance of developing interventions or policies aimed at improving older Medicare beneficiaries’ access to needed health care. ...|$|R

5|$|A unique {{feature of}} Murder on the Orient Express is Poirot, {{who serves as}} a hint system for the {{duration}} of the game. The player can access Poirot at any time during the game, and can receive hints to help them proceed. The game has two difficulty levels, and the player can determine which one they prefer to play at soon after the murder occurs. Poirot challenges the player, allowing them to choose to either readily accept help from him and allow him to guide the player through the game, or alternatively try to outsmart the famous sleuth by solving the mystery with obscure, and in some cases nonexistent hints. If the player <b>has</b> <b>trouble</b> once they have chosen the more difficult setting, Poirot will gradually become more forthcoming with information.|$|E
5|$|After Cameron retires, Keating hires Roark, whom Francon soon fires {{for refusing}} to design a {{building}} in the classical style. Roark works briefly at another firm, then opens his own office but <b>has</b> <b>trouble</b> finding clients and closes it down. He gets {{a job in a}} granite quarry owned by Francon. There he meets Francon's daughter Dominique, a columnist for The New York Banner, while she is staying at her family's estate nearby. They are immediately attracted to each other, leading to a rough sexual encounter that Dominique later calls a rape. Shortly after, Roark is notified that a client is ready to start a new building, and he returns to New York. Dominique also returns to New York and learns Roark is an architect. She attacks his work in public, but visits him for secret sexual encounters.|$|E

During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (Kristin Chenoweth) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and {{he is unable to}} stop the woman before she disappears. He only knows she wears a crucifix and is an Aries, which means her birthday is soon. Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping this woman, and begins visiting the city's red-light district with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a homeless man named Gus (Gene Larche), but with no money for him, he gives him a rosary instead. Later, he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O'Brien (Brian Baumgartner), who advises him not to become too personally involved.|$|E

After getting samples of Hock's DNA from his private quarters, recording a sample of his voice, and disabling the vault's defenses, Kasumi and Shepard infiltrate the vault. As Kasumi starts cracking the graybox, the pair is detected and attacked by Hock's forces. Kasumi and Shepard eventually manage to escape in a shuttle after destroying a gunship piloted by Hock. After the mission, Kasumi accesses the graybox and sees her partner one last time. A hologram of Okuda reveals the data, saying that it would impact humanity's reputation if made public. He begs her to destroy the data along with his memories. Kasumi <b>has</b> <b>trouble</b> letting him go, showing that their relationship was much more than professional.

Chris also has a series of one-night stands and gets two warnings at work from his new boss, Danni Ferguson (Laura McIntosh). Chris is arrested when he punches Josh Willis, who spoke to a journalist about Chris and Hudson's relationship. Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) drives Chris to the prison, so he can see Hudson and sort things out. Hudson tells Chris that he cut off contact as he needed time to prepare himself for prison. Chris asks Hudson to give their relationship another go and he agrees. Chris keeps Hudson's incarceration a secret from his parents, so he is angered when Sonya Rebecchi (Eve Morey) inadvertently reveals his secret to his mother, Patricia (Katerina Kotsonis).

Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{and the women}} of the office teach him how to {{interact}} with women. The lesson, which is taught by Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith), goes nowhere, and they give up. Pam goes with Dwight to the White Pages, only to find out that the buyer is Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin). Jan was expecting to meet with CEO David Wallace, and reprimands her assistant for the confusion. Pam quickly realizes that the meeting was just a ruse to take revenge on David for firing her five years prior. However, Dwight remains determined to make the sale, so he has Pam stall while he gets Clark (Clark Duke), intuiting that Jan has an attraction to underage men due to her rumored affair with her 17-year-old former assistant Hunter. After he introduces Clark to her, Jan says she will think about it, and tells everyone to leave her office except Clark. As Pam and Dwight leave, Dwight offers a sympathetic comment to Jan's assistant (a woman). Pam is pleased, seeing that some of the lessons they gave Dwight on women sunk in after all.|$|E

Sarah has many toys that she has grown out of and realizes that Toby is in possession of her treasured teddy bear Lancelot. Frustrated by this and his constant crying, Sarah rashly wishes Toby be taken away by the Goblin King Jareth, a character in the play she is rehearsing. She is shocked when Toby disappears and the Goblin King confronts her and transports her to his kingdom. He refuses to return the baby but gives Sarah thirteen hours to solve his labyrinth and find him before Toby is turned into a goblin forever.

Michael, the policeman who the Mallards visited, stops traffic for the family to cross. Michael calls police headquarters and instructs them to send a police car to stop traffic along the route for the ducks. The ducks cross the highway, Embankment Road (Storrow Drive {{had yet to be}} constructed when the book was written), then proceed down Mount Vernon Street to Charles Street where they head south to the Garden. The people on the streets admire the family of ducks. When the family must cross Beacon Street to enter the Garden, there are four policemen standing in the intersection stopping traffic {{to make way for the}} ducklings. Mr. Mallard is waiting in the Public Garden for the rest of the family. Finally, the family decides to stay in the Garden and lives happily ever after. They end each day searching for peanuts and food, and when night falls, they swim to their little island and go to sleep.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{collapse}} of a solar-mass protostellar nebula takes around 100,000years. Every nebula begins {{with a certain amount}} of angular momentum. Gas in the central part of the nebula, with relatively low angular momentum, undergoes fast compression and forms a hot hydrostatic (not contracting) core containing a small fraction of the mass of the original nebula. This core forms the seed of what will become a star. As the collapse continues, conservation of angular momentum means that the rotation of the infalling envelop accelerates, which largely prevents the gas from directly accreting onto the central core. The gas is instead forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane, forming a disk, which in turn accretes onto the core. The core gradually grows in mass until it becomes a young hot protostar. At this stage, the protostar and its disk are heavily obscured by the infalling envelope and are not directly observable. In fact the remaining envelope's opacity is so high that even millimeter-wave radiation <b>has</b> <b>trouble</b> escaping from inside it. Such objects are observed as very bright condensations, which emit mainly millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave radiation. They are classified as spectral Class0 protostars. The collapse is often accompanied by bipolar outflows—jets—that emanate along the rotational axis of the inferred disk. The jets are frequently observed in star-forming regions (see Herbig–Haro (HH) objects). The luminosity of the Class0 protostars is high— a solar-mass protostar may radiate at up to 100 solar luminosities. The source of this energy is gravitational collapse, as their cores are not yet hot enough to begin nuclear fusion.|$|E

5|$|Valhalla {{is first}} {{mentioned}} in chapter 2 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{where it is}} described partially in euhemerized form. In the chapter, King Gylfi sets out to Asgard {{in the guise of}} an old man going by the name of Gangleri to find the source {{of the power of the}} gods. The narrative states that the Æsir foresaw his arrival and had prepared grand illusions for him, so that when Gangerli enters the fortress, he sees a hall of such a height that he <b>has</b> <b>trouble</b> seeing over it, and notices that the roof of the hall is covered in golden shields, as if they were shingles. Snorri then quotes a stanza by the skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir (c. 900). As he continues, Gangleri sees a man in the doorway of the hall juggling short swords, and keeping seven in the air at once. Among other things, the man says that the hall belongs to his king, and adds that he can take Gangleri to the king. Gangleri follows him, and the door closes behind him. All around him he sees many living areas, and throngs of people, some of which are playing games, some are drinking, and others are fighting with weapons. Gangleri sees three thrones, and three figures sitting upon them: High sitting on the lowest throne, Just-As-High sitting on the next highest throne, and Third sitting on the highest. The man guiding Gangleri tells him that High is the king of the hall.|$|E
