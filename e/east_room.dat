5|$|The White House is {{the oldest}} {{building}} on President's Park. An {{integral part of the}} planned city that is Washington, D.C., a design was chosen and construction begun in 1792, and the building (although unfinished) was opened for occupancy on November 1, 1800. The first people to occupy the building were President John Adams and his wife, Abigail. Parts of the mansion were unfinished, including the cavernous <b>East</b> <b>Room.</b> With no running water (it was not installed until 1834), water had to be brought into the house by jug and heated for bathing or laundry to be done. Abigail Adams often hung the family's laundry up to dry in the drafty <b>East</b> <b>Room.</b> The ghost of Abigail Adams has been seen since shortly after her death in 1818, arms extended as if she were still carrying laundry into the <b>East</b> <b>Room,</b> accompanied by the smell of soap or damp clothing. Household staff in the Taft administration even observed her walking through walls.|$|E
5|$|Another celebrated {{image of}} Washington is the Lansdowne {{portrait}}, a large portrait with one version {{hanging in the}} <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> of the White House. This painting was saved during the burning of Washington by British troops in the War of 1812 through the intervention of First Lady Dolley Madison and Paul Jennings, one of President James Madison's slaves. Four versions of the portrait are attributed to Stuart, and additional copies were painted by other artists for display in U.S. government buildings. In 1803, Stuart opened a studio in Washington, D. C.|$|E
5|$|Howe's health {{declined}} in 1934, {{and he was}} hospitalized for heart problems and breathing difficulties. He {{spent the last two}} years of his life in and out of Bethesda Naval Hospital. Though he experienced increasing periods of confusion, he continued to give orders to his staff by telephone; Roosevelt had instructed them to treat Howe's calls with courtesy, but to double-check his instructions with himself and other staff. Howe died on April 18, 1936. Roosevelt gave him a state funeral three days later in the White House <b>East</b> <b>Room.</b>|$|E
60|$|Little {{by little}} {{she felt the}} rest quieting her. In a few minutes she became {{conscious}} of the triumph of having won {{her way to the}} <b>east</b> <b>rooms.</b> In a few minutes she was strong enough to rise from the chair, to take the keys from her pocket, and to look round her.|$|R
50|$|The <b>east</b> <b>rooms</b> were {{combined}} {{into a large}} gallery when the museum occupied the space. The lower hall and stairs have a flat-paneled dado, and the upstairs hallway has a dado of its own with floral and ornamental designs on the plaster. The library, upstairs, has a parquet floor more intricate than the other rooms.|$|R

5|$|On July 8, 2002, in a {{ceremony}} in the White House <b>East</b> <b>Room,</b> Versace was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President George W. Bush for his heroism, the first time an Army POW had been awarded the nation's highest honor for actions in captivity. Present were his surviving siblings, Dr. Stephen Versace, Richard (former coach of the Indiana Pacers), Michael and Trilby Versace. On November 7, 2008, the Department of the Army announced the revocation of Versace's Silver Star because it was upgraded to the Medal of Honor.|$|E
5|$|By then, Morgan {{was drawn}} into another situation. There was deep {{concern that the}} Trust Company of America and the Lincoln Trust might fail to open on Monday due to {{continuing}} runs by depositors. On Saturday evening 40–50 bankers had gathered at the library to discuss the crisis, with the clearing-house bank presidents in the <b>East</b> <b>room</b> and the trust company executives in the West room. Morgan and those dealing with the Moore & Schley situation {{had moved to the}} librarian’s office. There Morgan told his counselors that he would agree to help shore up Moore & Schley only if the trust companies would work together to bail out their weakest brethren. The discussion among the bankers continued late into Saturday night but without much progress. Around midnight, J.P. Morgan informed a leader of the trust company presidents that keeping Moore & Schley afloat would require $25 million, and he would not commit those funds unless the problems with the trust companies could also be resolved. The trust company executives understood they would not receive further help from Morgan; they would have to finance any bailout of the two struggling trust companies.|$|E
25|$|John F. Kennedy – Kennedy's body lay in repose in the <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> {{beginning}} about 4:40a.m. on November 23, 1963. A blessing {{was said}} by a Catholic priest at 5:00a.m. on November 23, but the Mass at 10:00a.m. {{was held in}} the State Dining Room rather than <b>East</b> <b>Room.</b> A second Mass (not a funeral Mass), for Kennedy family members and close friends, occurred in the <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> at 11:15a.m. on November 24. Kennedy's casket was removed from the <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> at about 1:00p.m.|$|E

50|$|The East Sitting Hall {{is located}} {{on the second floor of}} the White House, home of the President of the United States.

25|$|The <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> is {{an event}} and {{reception}} room in the White House, {{the home of the}} President of the United States. The <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> is the largest room in the Executive Mansion; it is used for dances, receptions, press conferences, ceremonies, concerts, and banquets. The <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> {{was one of the last}} rooms to be finished and decorated, and it has undergone substantial redecoration over the past two centuries. Since 1964, the Committee for the Preservation of the White House has, by executive order, advised the President of the United States and First Lady of the United States on the decor, preservation, and conservation of the <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> and other public rooms at the White House.|$|E
25|$|Two {{funerals}} {{were held}} in the <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> in the 1860s. The first was that of 11-year-old Willie Lincoln, President Abraham Lincoln's son, who died of typhoid fever on February 21, 1862. Just over three years later, Lincoln's body lay in state in the <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> as well, and his funeral was held there on April 19.|$|E
25|$|The <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> {{was among}} the last rooms on the State Floor to be {{completed}} and used. The White House was unfinished when President John Adams occupied it between 1800 and 1801. His wife, Abigail Adams, hung laundry in the bare <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> to dry. Although much of the White House was finished and decorated during Adams administration, the <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> was not. The room's lone artwork was {{a copy of the}} Lansdowne portrait depicting George Washington, painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1797. It was purchased by the White House in 1800, and hung in the <b>East</b> <b>Room.</b> (Rescued from the 1814 fire, it still hangs there, with a companion portrait of Martha Washington painted by Eliphalet Frazer Andrews in 1878.) There was extensive feeling in Congress that Adams had adopted too many of the trappings of monarchy, and Congress declined to appropriate funds to finish the room for fear it would look too much like a throne room. During the Jefferson administration, 38 gold-and-black painted chairs were purchased and placed in the room, but little else is known of the room's furnishings prior to 1814. Jefferson also had the <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> partitioned (using canvas and sailcloth for walls) and the southern end used for a bedroom and office for Meriwether Lewis and Lewis Harvie (both Private Secretary to the President).|$|E

50|$|The East Sitting Hall {{was more}} distinctively set {{off from the}} Center Hall by the 1952 reconstruction. The steps leading from the Center Hall to the <b>East</b> Hall <b>Room</b> were removed, and small storage spaces added on {{the north and south}} side of the passage. This roughly halved the width of the hall here, which created a more private <b>East</b> Sitting <b>Room.</b> A very narrow {{servants}} stair was added in the north storage area to provide additional access to the Third Floor.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{happened}} as she descended the stairs, nothing {{happened as}} she passed along the corridor; the house was as silent and as solitary as ever. She crossed the Banqueting-Hall this time without hesitation; {{the events of the}} night had hardened her mind against all imaginary terrors. [...] "Now, I have got it!" [...] she whispered to herself, in an irrepressible outburst of exaltation, as she entered the first of the <b>east</b> <b>rooms</b> and put her candle {{on the top of the}} old bureau.|$|R
25|$|While the Kennedy {{stage was}} fine for the small, {{intimate}} {{performances in the}} <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> which the Kennedys favored, the President Lyndon B. Johnson and First Lady Lady Bird Johnson favored larger, more elaborate performances. Ballet patron Rebekah Harkness learned of the Johnsons' desire for a larger stage, and contacted noted ballet and theatrical designer Jo Mielziner to design something. Mielziner crafted a stage which took up a full third of the <b>East</b> <b>Room,</b> and featured cream white-painted pilasters matching the room's architecture. Mileziner originally wanted the stage's curtains {{to have the same}} fabric used for the <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> drapes. But when he learned of the cost, he settled for American-made gold silk curtains instead. The larger stage took eight men three days to set up.|$|E

25|$|The {{house has}} been through several {{different}} owners since that subdivision, {{some of whom have}} made some changes. In 1940 the porches were removed, replaced with a patio in the rear and the millstone in front, and a large entryway cut inside between the <b>east</b> <b>rooms</b> on the first floor. Later owners have respected the house as part of the county's history; however sometime between the Register listing and 2009 the portions of the chimneys originally exposed on the exterior's first story have been covered in clapboard.|$|R
50|$|In 1911, Kendrick's son Greene Kendrick II {{sold the}} house to the Mattatuck Historical Society for use as a museum. By that time most of the other houses on the Green and {{neighboring}} streets had been demolished and replaced by the larger commercial blocks that dominate the area now. The historical society converted the house for museum use, merging all the <b>east</b> <b>rooms</b> into a large gallery for exhibits. It remained in the house until the construction of its current home across the Green in 1987.|$|R

25|$|President Chester Arthur {{hired the}} Washington, D.C., firm of W. B. Moses & Son to redecorate {{much of the}} White House in 1881, {{including}} the <b>East</b> <b>Room.</b> Moses & Son added new window curtains and drapes, and a suite of ebony furniture carved in a Japanese style. This suite included sofas, arm chairs, side chairs, and corner chairs. Arthur then auctioned off an immense quantity of older White House furnishings in April 1882, including some amount of undescribed older furniture from the <b>East</b> <b>Room.</b> Desiring an even grander approach to the public rooms, Arthur hired Tiffany & Co. in 1882 to redecorate the <b>East</b> <b>Room</b> yet again. Most of this work involved painting and regilding, however. No new furniture was ordered, and the over-mantel and pier mirrors reframed or regilded.|$|E
