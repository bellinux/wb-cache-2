5000|$|Any {{direct debit}} {{instruction}} {{that has not been}} used to collect funds for over 13 months is automatically cancelled by the customer's bank [...] (this is known as a [...] "dormancy period"). This can cause problems when the mandate is used infrequently, for instance, taking a payment to settle the bill for a seldom-used credit card. If the credit card company has not collected a payment using the Direct <b>Debit</b> <b>mandate</b> for over 13 months the direct <b>debit</b> <b>mandate</b> may have been cancelled as dormant without the customer's knowledge, and the direct debit claim will fail.|$|E

The client signs a <b>debit</b> <b>mandate</b> form giving the requesting company permission to debit their account with a fixed or variable monthly value. This value can be recurring or once-off.

40|$|With the SEPA {{migration}} {{end date}} set for February 2014, banks and creditors need to adapt their systems {{to support the}} management of SEPA Direct <b>Debit</b> (SDD) <b>mandates.</b> This white paper is targeted at banks, creditors, and service providers seeking a solution that streamlines their processes and complies with the new SEPA requirements and recommendations. It presents possible alternatives and discusses their respective advantages and limitations. The investigated alternatives are: - (Scanned) paper mandates and two-corner model mandate solutions - Three-corner model-based mandates that make use of a digital signature, and - Four-corner model solutions for e-mandates which directly involve the debtor bank and the creditor bank. These solutions are assessed based on arguments {{taking into account the}} mandate validity, the efficiency for all involved actors (debtor, debtor bank, creditor and creditor bank), and the reachability of potential debtors and creditors...|$|R
