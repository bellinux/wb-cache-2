5|$|Lynch's {{original}} {{rough cut}} ran for approximately four hours. He was contractually obligated {{to deliver a}} two-hour movie by De Laurentiis and cut many small subplots and character scenes. He also made cuts {{at the request of}} the MPAA. For example, when Frank slaps Dorothy after the first rape scene, the audience was supposed to see Frank actually hitting her. Instead, the film cuts away to Jeffrey in the closet, wincing at what he has <b>just</b> <b>seen.</b> This cut was made to satisfy the MPAA's concerns about violence. Lynch thought that the change only made the scene more disturbing. In 2011, Lynch announced that footage from the deleted scenes, long thought lost, had been discovered. The material was subsequently included on the Blu-ray disc release of the film. The final cut of the film runs at just over two hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{completion}} {{of all the}} major objectives, {{as well as some}} that were not considered vital, upgraded the telescope to its most technologically advanced state since its launch nineteen years ago, and made it more powerful than ever. The upgrades will also help Hubble to see deeper into the universe, and farther into the past, closer to the time of the Big Bang. Hubble's importance to science is not <b>just</b> <b>seen</b> in the dramatic images it provides, but also in the volume of work it has generated – an average of fourteen scientific articles are published each week based on data gathered from the telescope. Officially, the upgrades should extend Hubble's life through 2014, but Hubble Space Telescope Senior Scientist David Leckrone noted prior to the mission that if all of the mission's objectives were successful, the telescope could easily last longer than that. The next large telescope scheduled to be launched is the James Webb Space Telescope in 2018, which is infrared-only, so to have Hubble, which has ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared capabilities, still operational after 2018 would be of great benefit to the scientific community.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first real crisis of his career, and he most certainly {{would have known that}} even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had <b>just</b> <b>seen</b> a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E

25|$|The {{religions}} of Chinese Buddhism and Taoism {{require that}} monks and nuns eat an egg free, onion free vegetarian diet. Since abbeys were usually self-sufficient, in practice this meant they ate a vegan diet. Many religious orders also avoid hurting plant life by avoiding root vegetables. This is not <b>just</b> <b>seen</b> as an ascetic practice, but Chinese spirituality generally believes that animals have immortal souls, {{and that a}} diet of mostly grain is the healthiest for humans.|$|E

25|$|The act for {{the most}} part simply reiterates {{existing}} provisions in the Criminal Code, the Code of Consumption, the Code of Public Health and the New Code of Civil Procedure and does so for a precise purpose in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights, as we have <b>just</b> <b>seen.</b> Consequently, even if it had been possible to achieve the same objective by recourse to existing provisions, there is nothing to prevent the passing of an act which has the advantage of grouping together all the provisions necessary to achieve that objective.|$|E

25|$|A {{very small}} {{preliminary}} {{study published in}} 2016 shows that prayer helps people who have achieved sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous reduce cravings for alcohol. The study used a MRI machine to scan how subjects reacted to images of people drinking. The study randomly assigned the subjects, so that some subjects saw the images after saying prayers in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous; others after reading newspaper articles. The people who had <b>just</b> <b>seen</b> the prayers reported feeling fewer cravings for alcohol; the MRI scans of their brains confirmed {{that there was a}} different reaction.|$|E

Charles Laughton visited in 1961, saying “I have <b>just</b> <b>seen</b> the four best productions of Shakespeare that I have {{ever seen in my}} life.” Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper visited in 1962, attending two plays. Stacy Keach was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. Duke Ellington and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.|$|E

25|$|In April 1936 it was {{reported}} that RKO had purchased the rights to the serialized story, The Big Game, by Francis Wallace, which had appeared in Collier's magazine. On April 8 RKO announced that Pandro Berman would handle the producing duties. Later that month RKO hired a young author, Irwin Shaw, to pen the screenplay. Shaw had <b>just</b> <b>seen</b> the successful production of his first play on Broadway, Bury the Dead. In June the studio assigned Nicholls to direct, shortly after renewing his contract. Also in June, it was announced that Berman would be the producer, although it was initially reported that the director would be George Stevens.|$|E
25|$|Twentieth-Century Fox brought Allen {{in for a}} rewrite {{when they}} were unhappy with the script that David Mamet had {{produced}} from Barry Reed's novel The Verdict, thinking he had deviated too much from the original material. She produced a script they were happy with, but then handed it to Robert Redford, who began to tinker it to fit his persona. Eventually the producers took it away from Redford and offered it to Lumet, who had <b>just</b> <b>seen</b> a production of Mamet's, American Buffalo with Al Pacino, and preferred to use Mamet's original script. In the end the studio had paid both Allen and Redford and ended up with Mamet's original script anyway.|$|E
25|$|At around 6pm on 5 June 1983, Einem (possibly {{along with}} other unknown persons) {{abducted}} Kelvin in a North Adelaide street, just 60 metres from Kelvins' home in Ward Street. Kelvin had <b>just</b> <b>seen</b> off a friend at a nearby bus stop {{on the corner of}} O'Connell and Marian Streets, North Adelaide, and was returning home for dinner. Several witnesses living near to the Kelvins' home heard cries for help, car doors slamming, and a car with a noisy exhaust speeding away. Significantly, Kelvin had a dog collar in his possession which was likely to have attracted Einem's attention. Einem then tortured, drugged, raped and held Kelvin captive for five weeks, before murdering him and dumping his body alongside an airstrip near Kersbrook in the Adelaide Hills area (to the north-east of the city and close to where relatives of Einem lived).|$|E

25|$|A magic {{ring that}} {{provides}} invulnerability to death is encountered {{not only in}} this tale of Sir Eglamour of Artois. In a 12th-century romance Floris and Blancheflour, Floris's mother gives her son a ring when he departs, disguised as a merchant, {{to look for the}} maiden Blancheflour, whose tomb he has <b>just</b> <b>seen</b> to be empty. ‘Take this ring, son. While you are wearing it, you need fear nothing. Fire will not burn you, the sea will not drown you and steel {{will not be able to}} cut you,' she urges him. And the boy Perceval, in the Middle English romance Sir Perceval of Galles, steals a ring from the finger of a sleeping maiden, and only after having travelled to a Land of Maidens and defeated an entire Saracen army singlehandedly, does he learn that it is a magic ring that confers invulnerability to its wearer. In the late-14th century Middle English alliterative poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Sir Gawain refuses the offer of a ring from Sir Bertilak's amorous wife before accepting, instead, another circular adornment, a girdle, that will protect him from ever being killed, and which he wears when he goes to suffer a return stroke of the axe from the Knight of the Green Chapel.|$|E
