She pretends to return a ham to the meat department but decides to hide it in her purse instead. <b>Hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to theft. She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a Matisse painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is caught by Brian, who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing is not going to solve problems. Lois accepts his reasoning, but as she loads up the car to return her stolen goods, she is caught by Joe and arrested.|$|E
5|$|Of the 22 {{species of}} {{albatross}} recognised by the IUCN, all {{are listed as}} at some level of concern; 3 species are Critically Endangered, 5 species are Endangered, 7 species are Near Threatened, and 7 species are Vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, but today the albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become <b>hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations {{and people in the}} fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.|$|E

500|$|Of the 21 {{albatross}} species recognised by IUCN {{on their}} Red List, 19 are threatened, {{and the other}} two are [...] "near threatened". Three species (as recognised by the IUCN) are considered critically endangered: the Amsterdam albatross, Tristan albatross and waved albatross. One of the main threats is commercial longline fishing, as the albatrosses and other seabirds—which will readily feed on offal—are attracted to the set bait, become <b>hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lines and drown. An estimated 100,000 albatross per year are killed in this fashion. Unregulated pirate fisheries exacerbate the problem.|$|E

Disney agreed and Peet created an original treatment, with little supervision, as he had done with One Hundred and One Dalmatians and The Sword in the Stone. However, after the disappointing reaction to The Sword in the Stone, Walt Disney decided to become more involved in the story than he had been with the past two films, with his nephew Roy E.

500|$|McNallen {{was born}} in the rural town of Breckenridge, Texas on October 15, 1948 to a family of {{practicing}} Roman Catholics. After high school, he attended Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, Texas. While there, he began to investigate alternative religions, reading about the modern Pagan religion of Wicca and the writings of the occultist Aleister Crowley. In his freshman year of college he read a novel, The Viking, by Edison Marshall, which generated his interest in the societies of pre-Christian Scandinavia. According to him, upon reading this book he [...] "got <b>hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spirit of the North", being attracted to the Vikings by what he perceived as [...] "their warlike nature, their will to power, and their assertion of self". In 1968 or 1969 he dedicated himself to the worship of the deities found in Norse mythology, and remained a solitary devotee of theirs for about two years. He later noted that on initially becoming a Heathen, he went through [...] "a stridently anti-Christian phase", and that while he later mellowed in his opinion of Christianity and Christians, he still believed the religion to be [...] "a faulty faith, a foreign imposition on European soil" [...] which had eroded [...] "our traditional culture" [...] and [...] "done us great damage".|$|E
500|$|... 2001 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated, [...] "2001 isn't as consistent or striking as Slim Shady, {{but the music}} is always brimming with character." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair praised the production, calling it [...] "uncharacteristically sparse sound" [...] from Dr. Dre {{and that it was}} as [...] "addictive as it was back when over 3million record buyers got <b>hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Chronic and Snoop Dogg's Dre-produced Doggystyle" [...] and went on to commend Dr. Dre, stating, [...] "If any rap producer deserves the title [...] "composer", it's he." [...] NME mentioned that Dr. Dre didn't expand the genre, but it was [...] "powerful enough in parts, but not clever enough to give Will Smith the fear". PopMatters writer Chris Massey declared that [...] "Musically, 2001 is about as close to brilliant as any one gangsta rap album might possibly get." [...] Christopher John Farley of Time stated that [...] "The beats are fresh and involving, and Dre's collaborations with Eminem and Snoop Dogg have ferocity and wit." [...] Although he was ambivalent towards the album's subject matter and guest rappers, Greg Tate of Spin was pleasantly surprised by [...] "the most memorable MC'ing on this album com from Dre himself, Eminem notwithstanding" [...] and stated, [...] "Whatever one's opinion of the sexual politics and gun lust of Dre's canon, his ongoing commitment to formal excellence and sonic innovation in this art form may one day earn him a place next to George Clinton, if not Stevie Wonder, Duke Ellington, or Miles Davis." ...|$|E

"Knature of a Girl" [...] was {{the first}} record by the Shamen to feature Sinnott, {{but it was not}} until June's [...] "Jesus Loves Amerika" [...] single that the techno {{influence}} began to show. By this stage, Angus and Sinnott had become <b>hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> acid house movement taking place in London, and its music and clubs were to exert a massive influence on the pair. Keith McKenzie and Peter Stephenson were less impressed by these new developments, and left the group the following summer, after the January 1989 release of the In Gorbachev We Trust album, which saw the group further enhancing their sound. Over the summer 1988, they met Mr. C and Evil Eddie Richards, who would later both work with the Shamen to help them transition their music into the rave scene.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Variety disliked {{the film and}} said in its review, [...] "Tron is loaded with visual delights but falls way short of the mark in story and viewer involvement. Screenwriter-director Steven Lisberger has {{adequately}} marshalled a huge force of technicians to deliver the dazzle, but even kids (and specifically computer game geeks) will {{have a difficult time}} getting <b>hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> situations". In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin criticized the film's visual effects: [...] "They're loud, bright and empty, and they're all this movie has to offer". The Washington Posts Gary Arnold wrote, [...] "Fascinating as they are as discrete sequences, the computer-animated episodes don't build dramatically. They remain a miscellaneous form of abstract spectacle". In his review for the Globe and Mail, Jay Scott wrote, [...] "It's got momentum and it's got marvels, but it's without heart; it's a visionary technological achievement without vision".|$|E

2500|$|William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, stating: [...] "Zwick's narrative skills keep us <b>hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> story, and the first-rate production values and imaginative use of locations (it {{was shot in}} Mozambique) give the film an enthralling scope and epic sweep." [...] Damon Wise of the Empire magazine gave the film four-stars-out-of-five, he stated: [...] "Great performances, provocative ideas and gripping action scenes fall prey to Hollywood logic and pat storytelling in the final hour." [...] David Edelstein of the New York magazine also gave the film a positive review, stating: [...] "Given that the movie doesn't have a single narrative surprise--you always know where it's going and why, commercially speaking, it's going there--it's amazing how good Blood Diamond is. I guess that's the surprise." [...] Ann Hornaday of the Washington Post also praised DiCaprio's acting, saying that he [...] "who between this outing and The Departed has undergone a major growth spurt this year." [...] About the film itself, she stated: [...] "For its flaws, Blood Diamond is a gem, if only for being an unusually smart, engaged popcorn flick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eclipse {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Anne Rouyer of School Library Journal {{gave the}} novel a positive review and said that, [...] "Meyer knows what her fans want: thrills, chills, {{and a lot}} of romance, and she delivers on all counts." [...] Rouyer also thought that as in the two previous installments, [...] "it is Meyer's effective and intense portrayal of first love in all its urgency, passion, and confusion that drives the story along with the supernatural elements coming in a close second", and said that the [...] "injection of heightened sexual tension and sensuality that hasn't been present in the series before" [...] contributed well to the emotional atmosphere of the novel. However, she found that the werewolves' and vampires' histories slowed the book's pace and called the newborn army's story a [...] "convoluted add-in", while noting that they [...] "contribute in some way to Bella's epiphanies about her future." [...] Katie Trattner of Blogcritics praised the characters and their development throughout the novel, particularly the histories of Rosalie and Jasper—contradicting Rouyer—stating, [...] "The history that formed them and their reactions towards Bella become clear and the characters much more solid because of this knowledge. I think {{that is part of the}} appeal of these books—the fact that you do become so wrapped up in the characters, that they touch places deep inside yourself." [...] She commended Meyer for painting a good emotional image, as well as Bella's emotional growth, and went on to say that she [...] "writes so fluidly and propels the reader forward so effortlessly." [...] Selby Gibson-Boyce of Tulsa World wrote, [...] "I read without stopping until I finished. Meyer's book would not detach itself from my hand. Exactly the same thing happened with Twilight and New Moon." [...] Publishers Weekly wrote, [...] "The legions of readers who are <b>hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> romantic struggles of Bella and the vampire Edward will ecstatically devour this third installment of the story", while noting that, [...] "it's unlikely to win over any newcomers." [...] Kirkus Reviews concluded its review stating that the book's [...] "unsettling racially charged characterizations are offset by messages of overcoming difference and working together. Fans of Bella's angst-drenched love triangle will gobble this entry up, and the open-ended conclusion paves the way for Jake's story to come." ...|$|E

60|$|The beauty, the darling, the daisy, my Salmon Bahadur, weighed twelve pounds, and I {{had been}} seven-and-thirty minutes {{bringing}} him to bank! He had been lightly <b>hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{angle of the}} right jaw, and the hook had not wearied him. That hour I sat among princes and crowned heads greater than them all. Below the bank we heard California scuffling with his salmon and swearing Spanish oaths. Portland and I assisted at the capture, and the fish dragged the spring balance out by the roots. It was only constructed to weigh up to fifteen pounds. We stretched the three fish on the grass--the eleven and a half, the twelve and fifteen pounder--and we gave an oath that all who came after should merely be weighed and put back again.|$|E
60|$|How shall I {{tell the}} glories of that day so {{that you may be}} interested? Again and again did California and I prance down that reach to the little bay, each with a salmon in tow, and land him in the shallows.

Each fish, for the merits of the three that had died so gamely, was hastily <b>hooked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> balance and flung back, Portland {{recording}} the weight in a pocket-book, for he was a real-estate man. Each fish fought for all he was worth, and none more savagely than the smallest--a game little six-pounder. At the end of six hours we added up the list. Total: 16 fish, aggregate weight 142 lbs. The score in detail runs something like this--it is only interesting to those concerned: 15, 11-1/2, 12, 10, 9-3/4, 8, and so forth; as I have said, nothing under six pounds, and three ten-pounders.|$|E
