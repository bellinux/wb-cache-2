No gold was found but the company's equipment proved useful for dredging of harbours and docks; the company pioneered the manufacture of steam powered cranes with <b>grab</b> (<b>clamshell)</b> buckets.|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} reveals {{little about}} the prediction of the closing process of clamshell dredging buckets when cutting sand or clay under water. The results of research carried out, mostly relates {{to the use of}} clamshells in dry bulk materials. While good prediction of the forces (in dry materials) involved are possible by measuring the closing curve, the very prediction of the closing curve of clamshells in general, seems to be problematic. Because the dredging business is concerned with water-saturated sand or clay has to be dredged, the research into the closing process of <b>clamshell</b> <b>grabs</b> had to start from scratch (except for the kinematics of clamshells). In 1989 the research carried out by Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Company resulted in a numerical method of calculating the closing process of <b>clamshell</b> <b>grabs</b> in water saturated sand and clay, which simulates the closing of a clamshell so that production and forces can be predicted. The calculation method is based on the non-linear equations of motion of the buckets and the sand cutting theory Miedema presented at WODCON XII. A clay cutting theory is implemented in the numerical model but will not be taken into consideration in this paper. In 1991, Great Lakes and the Delft University of Technology carried out laboratory research in which a scale model clamshell was used. This research, carried out in dry and in water saturated sand, resulted in a verification and validation of the calculation method with respect to the closing curve, the angular velocity and the pulling force in the closing wire. This paper contains results of a literature survey, the equations of motion of a <b>clamshell</b> <b>grab,</b> background to the sand cutting theory, results of the computer program CLAMSHELL, and it will give some {{of the results of the}} research carried out with respect to verification and validation of the computer program...|$|R

There were some real practical inventions in the book including a lamp that would mechanically dim, alternating fountains, and a <b>clamshell</b> <b>grab.</b> Eighty of these devices were described as [...] "trick vessels" [...] that showed a real mastery of mechanics, with a real focus {{on the use of}} light pressure. Some of the devices seem to be replications of earlier Greek works, but the rest were much more advanced than what the Greeks had done.|$|R

The calculation method is based on the non-linear equations of motion of the buckets and the sand cutting theory Miedema presented in 1987 and 2006 and the clay cutting theory presented by Miedema (1992). The production of a clamshell depends on: 1. The dimensions of the clamshell. 2. The weight and weight distribution of the clamshell. 3. The geometry of the clamshell and especially the cutting edges. 4. The type of soil, the soil mechanical parameters. 5. The water depth...|$|R

All main {{units of the}} port are equipped with video surveillance systems. The process of unloading of coal laden railcars is performed at Rosterminalugol by two rotary car dumpers that can discharge the discharge simultaneously four gondola cars in three minutes at most. Therefore, this method virtually eliminates the mechanical damages to railcars possible while handling bulk materials with <b>clamshell</b> <b>grabs.</b> For {{the first time in}} Russia the traversers were used and have been successfully utilized for prompt formation of empty rolling stock. With the help of these transfer tables it is possible to expedite railcars supply to several parallel rail tracks without additional railroad switches. The railcar thawing system equipped with infrared transmitters operates to ensure the uninterrupted discharge of loaded cars in the winter season. After unloading coal is transferred to the conveyor belt through the grid with cells of 280-mm diameter. After that, having come through the aspiration equipment, the coal is automatically transported through the system of conveyor lines, to one of four warehouses or directly to the ship, depending on the loading scheme. The loading to the ships is performed by two high-technology ship loading machines on two berths, which enable simultaneous handling of two Panamax vessels.|$|R
