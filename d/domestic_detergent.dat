40|$|Alkylphenol polyethoxylates (APEOs) are commercially {{important}} {{non-ionic surfactants}} used in industrial and <b>domestic</b> <b>detergent</b> and emulsifier formulations (Ferugerson et al. 2001), and nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEO) and octylphenol ethoxylates (OPEO) {{are some of}} the most commonly used surfactants. The exposure of wildlife to these chemicals is mainly through water by discharge through wastewater treatment plant effluents and possibly sewage disposal (Montgomery-Brown and Reinhard 2003;Ying et al. 2002). It has been reported that partial biodegradation of NPEO in wastewater treatment plants generates more persistent nonylphenol (NP) and shorter-chain mono- to triethoxylates (NP 1 - 3 EO) (Giger et al. 1984).

In the PIREN Seine programme, the fate of urban pesticides is studied in the Orge River basin, where AMPA is frequently detected in higher concentrations than glyphosate. However, in the literature, it is well documented that AMPA might be also a degradation product of other phosphonates, particularly ethylene-diamine-tetra-methylenephosphonic acid (EDTMPA) and diethylene-triamine-penta-methylene-phosphonic acid (DTMTPA), essentially used in <b>domestic</b> <b>detergents...</b>|$|R

40|$|Quaternary {{ammonium}} compounds (QACs) {{are widely}} used as adjuncts to hygiene in domestic cleaning products. Current concern that {{the increased use of}} such biocides in consumer products might contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance has led us {{to examine the effects of}} a QAC-containing domestic cleaning fluid on the population dynamics and antimicrobial susceptibility of domestic sink drain biofilm communities. QAC susceptibilities of numerically dominant, culturable drain bacteria (15 genera, 17 species) were determined in vitro before and after repeated QAC exposure (14 passages). A fully characterized drain microcosm was then exposed to short-term (12 days) and long-term (3 months) dosing with a QAC-containing <b>domestic</b> <b>detergent</b> (QD). QAC exposure of isolated cultures caused both increases (three species) and circa twofold decreases (six species) in QAC susceptibility. The susceptibility of Ralstonia sp. was considerably decreased following 14 consecutive QAC passages. Control drain microcosm biofilms maintained dynamic stability, as evidenced by culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis. Bacterial population densities were largely unaffected during short-term exposure to use levels of QD, although 50 % QD caused circa 10 -fold viability reductions. DGGE analysis supported these observations; identified the major microcosm genera as Pseudomonas, Pseudoalteromonas, Erwinia, and Enterobacter, and showed that aeromonads increased in abundance under 10 to 50 % QD. Long-term exposure of the microcosms to QD did not significantly alter the pattern of antimicrobial susceptibility. These data demonstrate the recalcitrance of domestic drain biofilms toward QAC and that although repeated QAC exposure of drain isolates in pure culture results in susceptibility change in some test bacteria, such changes do not necessarily occur within complex communities...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{concern that}} the {{increased}} use of triclosan (TCS) in consumer products may contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance has led us {{to examine the effects of}} TCS dosing on domestic-drain biofilm microcosms. TCS-containing <b>domestic</b> <b>detergent</b> (TCSD) markedly lowered biofouling at 50 % (wt/vol) but was poorly effective at use levels. Long-term microcosms were established and stabilized for 6 months before one was subjected to successive 3 -month exposures to TCSD at sublethal concentrations (0. 2 and 0. 4 % [wt/vol]). Culturable bacteria were identified by 16 S rDNA sequence analysis, and their susceptibilities to four biocides and six antibiotics were determined. Microcosms harbored ca. 10 log 10 CFU/g of biofilm, representing at least 27 species, mainly gamma proteobacteria, and maintained dynamic stability. Viable cell counts were largely unaffected by TCSD exposure, but species diversity was decreased, as corroborated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis. TCS susceptibilities ranged widely within bacterial groups, and TCS-tolerant strains (including aeromonads, pseudomonads, stenotrophomonads, and Alcaligenes spp.) were isolated before and after TCSD exposure. Several TCS-tolerant bacteria related to Achromobacter xylosoxidans became clonally expanded during dosing. TCSD addition did not significantly affect the community profiles of susceptibility to the test biocides or antibiotics. Several microcosm isolates, as well as reference bacteria, caused clearing of particulate TCS in solid media. Incubations of consortia and isolates with particulate TCS in liquid led to putative TCS degradation by the consortia and TCS solubilization by the reference strains. Our results support the view that low-level exposure of environmental microcosms to TCS does not affect antimicrobial susceptibility and that TCS is degradable by common domestic biofilms...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasingly}} {{widespread use}} of non-ionic surfactants as main ingredients in <b>domestic</b> <b>detergent</b> formulations requires an understanding of their performance during washing, not only as separate products but also as binary mixtures with anionic surfactants. In order to attain acceptable levels of biodegradability and toxicity, alkyl polyglucosides (APGs) have appeared on the market. These non-ionic surfactants, obtained from natural substances (saccharides), are 100 % biodegradable and have very attractive features for application to washing.

The aim of our work was to analyze behavior in the staining of undyed cotton fabric with the dye desorbed in the washing of cotton fabric previously dyed and finished with resin and softened, by means of the use of the surfactant APGs with sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, separately and in mixtures in different proportions. Likewise, the staining of undyed diacetate, polyamide, polyester, acrylic, cotton and wool fabrics was obtained. The cotton was previously dyed with red, orange and blue direct dyes. The behavior of the discoloration of dyed and finished and unfinished cotton fabric and the staining of undyed fabrics in washing were related to the zeta potentials of the fabrics obtained by the streaming potential method {{in the presence of the}} surfactants and their mixtures used After washing, the undyed fabric with the anionic surfactant showed a greater difference in color than non-ionic surfactant and when the concentration of the non-ionic surfactant in the mixture was increased the color difference decreased.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{findings on}} the effect of <b>domestic</b> laundry <b>detergents</b> on the fastness to light of selected fibre reactive dyes applied to cotton. The study was carried out to elucidate the reasons for the accelerated colour loss of cotton garments washed under Australian domestic laundering conditions. Cotton fabric dyed with commonly used reactive dyes were laundered with water only, several <b>domestic</b> <b>detergents</b> and a laboratory formulated neutral detergent, and then exposed to light for two hours in the wet state. Quantities of detergent used were in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations. Exposures were repeated fifteen times equivalent to 30 hours exposure. Colour loss and colour difference were measured after 5, 10 and 15 wash cycles and 10, 20 and 30 hours exposure. When the fabric was exposed wet the colour faded more rapidly than when exposed dry to light. Detergents increased the colour loss even when the fabric was not exposed to light. The presence of an oxidizing bleach (sodium perborate) in the detergent increased colour loss during washing and wet exposure to light. Ultraviolet radiation from the light source, heat, moisture, alkali and oxidising bleach during exposure resulted in hydrolysis of the dye-fibre bond causing dye desorption during washing and rinsing. Water alone increased the fading of the dyes most likely due to presence of dissolved oxygen held within the fibre. The combination of ultraviolet radiation and oxidizing bleaches altered the chemistry of the dye and hence its shade. This was particularly evident on the black dye and one of the navy blue dyes...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to phosphorus enrichment associated with shrimp farm effluents, Sibu Laut River is also {{susceptible to the}} domestic sewage effluent.

In the present study, sub-surface TP and OP at station 2 were 2.9 times and 3.4 times higher than the other stations along Sibu Laut River; whereas IP concentration was similar to the other stations. The elevated phosphorus concentrations were confined to sub-surface water as near-bottom phosphorus at station 2 was similar or even lower than other stations. Since station 2 is near to the Sibu Laut Village, the high mean phosphorus concentration indicated that wastewater discharged from the village was likely to contribute to the high phosphorus observed as phosphorus is an important component of <b>domestic</b> <b>detergents.</b> Ling et al. (2010 a) reported high loading of reactive phosphorus into rivers in Kuching, Sarawak, from household wastewater, especially low income residential area which are attributable to more usage of phosphorus detergent.

40|$|Phosphorus is {{an element}} {{essential}} for life. Concerns regarding long-term security of supply and issues related to eutrophication of surface waters once released into the aquatic environment have led governments to consider and apply measures for reducing the use and discharge of phosphorus. Examples of source control include legislation to reduce phosphorus use in <b>domestic</b> <b>detergents.</b> This research shows that other domestic sources of phosphorus also contribute significantly to the domestic load to sewer and that overall, domestic sources dominate loads to sewage treatment works. Estimates provided here show that although the natural diet contributes 40 % of the domestic phosphorus load, other potentially preventable sources contribute significantly to the estimated 44, 000 tonnes of phosphorus entering UK sewage treatment works each year. In the UK, food additives are estimated to contribute 29 % of the domestic load; automatic dishwashing detergents contribute 9 % and potentially increasing; domestic laundry 14 %, including contributions from phosphonates, but decreasing; phosphorus dosing to reduce lead levels in tap water 6 %; food waste disposed of down the drain 1 %; and personal care products 1 %. Although UK data is presented here, it is anticipated that similar impacts would be expected for other developed economies. Consideration of alternatives to all preventable sources of phosphorus from these sources would therefore offer potentially significant reductions in phosphorus loads to sewage treatment works and hence to the aquatic environment. Combining all source control measures and applying them to their maximum extent could potentially lead to the prevention of over 22, 000 tonnes-P/year entering sewage treatment works...|$|R

Phosphate in sewage effluents arises from human wastes and <b>domestic</b> phosphate-based <b>detergents</b> and soaps (Ogunfowokan et al. 2005). Phosphorous is one of the important elements for the growth of algae, and its concentration in wastewater discharges has to be controlled/reduced in order to avoid noxious algal blooms.

40|$|Linear Alkyl benzene Sulfonic Acid (LAS) is {{the main}} {{ingredient}} of many commercial formulations for industrial and <b>domestic</b> synthetic <b>detergents.</b> The current industrial LAS production method includes sulfonation of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) with sulfur trioxide in tubular falling film reactors. In such reactors a diluted gaseous stream of SO 3 and dry air, feed gas, is contacted with liquid LAB while both reactants flow co-currently downward. The reaction is highly exothermic and product quality is primarily dependent on heat removal efficiency from the reactors, and also contact time. This research project investigates a new route {{for the production of}} LAS. This new method employs SO 2 oxidation over activated carbon at 25 oC to SO 3, followed by the extraction of the adsorbed SO 3 from the activated carbon by supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO 2). The condensed phase CO 2 -SO 3 mixture after expansion is contacted with LAB where sulfonation of this substrate occurs to yield LAS. The new route should offer lower operating temperatures and lower feed gas SO 3 concentrations in the sulfonation reaction to minimize loss of LAB to side-reactions and reduce LAS contamination (that appears as unacceptable product discoloration). The laboratory set up was designed, assembled and in total 25 experiments were carried out. Over the course of experiments a number of remedial actions were taken to improve set up functionality and reaction yield. The problems needed to be tackled included feed gas moisture removal, SO 2 /SO 3 adsorption/desorption efficiency, homogeneous mixing of reactants and reducing the SCCO 2 /SO 3 flow rate through LAB columns. The maximum LAB/LAS conversion obtained was 3. 6 % per sulfonation column. The maximum SO 3 removal efficiency from activated carbon obtained was 77 %. It was also found that nitrogen gas in a specific temperature range may be used as the desorbing agent in lieu of supercritical carbon dioxide with satisfactory performance.
