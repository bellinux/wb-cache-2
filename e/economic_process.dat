5|$|The main {{disadvantage}} to {{die casting}} {{is the very}} high capital cost. Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly, as compared to most other casting processes. Therefore, to make die casting an <b>economic</b> <b>process,</b> a large production volume is needed. Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high-fluidity metals, and casting weights must be between 30grams (1oz) and 10kg (20lb). In the standard die casting process the final casting will have {{a small amount of}} porosity. This prevents any heat treating or welding, because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand, which causes micro-cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface. Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable. Parts needing hardening (through hardening or case hardening) and tempering are not cast in dies.|$|E
25|$|Introducing {{the term}} 'low entropy' for {{valuable}} natural resources, and the term 'high entropy' for valueless waste and pollution, Georgescu explains {{that all the}} <b>economic</b> <b>process</b> does from a physical {{point of view is}} to irreversibly transform low entropy into high entropy, thereby providing a flow of natural resources for people to live on. The irreversibility of this <b>economic</b> <b>process</b> is the reason why natural resources are scarce: Recycling of material resources is possible, but only by using up some energy resources plus an additional amount of other material resources; and energy resources, in turn, cannot be recycled at all, but are dissipated as waste heat (according to the entropy law).|$|E

25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} the {{relevance}} of thermodynamics to economics stems from the physical fact that man can neither create nor destroy matter or energy, only transform it.

25|$|Globalization (or globalisation; see {{spelling}} differences) is {{the increasing}} interaction of people through {{the growth of the}} international flow of money, ideas and culture. Globalization is primarily an <b>economic</b> <b>process</b> of integration which has social and cultural aspects as well. It involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology and data. Advances in the means of transport (such as the steam locomotive, steamship, jet engine, and container ships) and in telecommunications infrastructure (including the rise of the telegraph and its modern offspring, the Internet and mobile phones) have been major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities.|$|E
25|$|In Georgescu's flow-fund {{model of}} production, a 'fund' factor is either labour power, farm land or {{man-made}} capital providing a useful service {{at any point}} in time; a 'stock' factor is a material or energy input that can be decumulated at will; and a 'flow' factor is a stock spread out over a period of time. The fund factors constitute the agents of the <b>economic</b> <b>process,</b> and the flow factors are used or acted upon by these agents. Unlike a stock factor, a fund factor cannot be utilised (decumulated) at will, as its rate of utilisation depends on the distinct physical properties of the fund (labour power and farm land, for instance, may run the risk of overutilisation and exhaustion if proper care is not taken).|$|E

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of the theory and methodology of social, political and <b>economic</b> <b>processes</b> risks in different countries with relative indicators of the socio-economic development level, as well as the size and condition of the public debt. Developed by the authors the methodology of determining the risks of social, political and <b>economic</b> <b>processes</b> of public policy around the world revealed close relationship between socio-economic situation of the countries and their public debt. Within the framework of this methodology two groups of factors characterizing the socio-political and <b>economic</b> <b>processes</b> in the country are being developed. After that each exponent and indicator are being processed, using expert procedures. Maximum statutory values for tentatively referenced countries with effective and ineffective government policies are identified. Then standardization (specification) and definition of integral (generalized) indexes of socio-political and <b>economic</b> <b>processes</b> in the country are taking place. After that the ranking of countries by aggregated standardized ratio is arranged, taking into account the significance of the developed indicators. The final phase of implementation methodology is identifying risks of social, political and <b>economic</b> <b>processes</b> of public policy around the world. This is the ranking of countries by ratio of stability in public policy (stability of <b>economic</b> and socio-political <b>processes</b> in the country). As the result of implementation methodology the following output was received: what really makes a difference is not the amount of the country's debt, but how effectively it manages this debt, whether it has a goal to improve social and economic indicators. Practical testing methodology has proven that studied indicators fully characterize the development of the countries, their political, social and economic situation on the world stage...|$|R

25|$|The life of Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (born Nicolae Georgescu) spanned {{most of the}} 20th century, from 1906 to 1994. In {{his native}} Romania, he lived through two world wars and three dictatorships before he fled the country. Living in {{political}} exile in the US {{in the second part}} of his life, he witnessed at a distance the rise and fall of socialism in Romania. He made many important contributions to mainstream neoclassical economics before he finally turned against it and published his paradigmatic magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the <b>Economic</b> <b>Process.</b> Although this opus was seminal in establishing ecological economics as an independent academic subdiscipline in economics, Georgescu-Roegen died disappointed and bitter that his paradigmatic work did not receive the appreciation he had expected for it in his own lifetime.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} {{to the position of}} Solow and Stiglitz, Georgescu argues that neoclassical economists generally fail to realise the important difference between material resources and energy resources in the <b>economic</b> <b>process.</b> This is where his flow-fund model of production comes into play (see above). Georgescu's point is that only material resources can be transformed into man-made capital. Energy resources, on the other hand, cannot be so transformed, as it is physically impossible to turn energy into matter, and matter is what man-made capital is made up of physically. The only possible role to be performed by energy resources is to assist — usually as fuel or electricity — in the process of transforming material resources into man-made capital. In Georgescu's own terminology, energy may have the form of either a stock factor (mineral deposits in nature), or a flow factor (resources transformed in the economy); but never that of a fund factor (man-made capital in the economy). Hence, substituting man-made capital for energy resources is physically impossible.|$|E
