2500|$|Years later, Chester Smith, {{the retired}} East Liverpool Police Captain and sharpshooter, {{described}} events differently in a 1979 interview for TIME magazine. Smith, who {{was credited with}} shooting Floyd first, stated that he had deliberately wounded, but not killed, Floyd. He added: [...] "I knew Purvis couldn't hit him, so I dropped him with two shots from my [...]32 Winchester rifle." [...] According to Smith's account, after being wounded, Floyd fell and did not regain his footing. Smith then disarmed Floyd. At that point, Purvis ran up and ordered: [...] "Back away from that man. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him." [...] Purvis questioned Floyd briefly, and after receiving curses in reply ordered agent Herman [...] "Ed" [...] Hollis to [...] "Fire into him." [...] Hollis then shot Floyd at point-blank range with a sub-machine gun, killing him. The interviewer {{asked if there was}} a cover-up by the FBI, and Smith responded: [...] "Sure was, because they didn't want it to get out that he'd been killed that way." ...|$|E

[...] He was a staff reporter at The Times from 1995 to 2007, ending his tenure {{as a member of}} the Los Angeles bureau. LeDuff, who had been on paternity leave, quit The Times to pursue the promotion of his second book, US Guys, according to a memorandum from Suzanne Daley, the national editor.
