40|$|The seed {{moisture}} level marking {{the onset of}} imbibitional injury (breakpoint) was determined for two cultivars of Phaseolus vulgaris L. cvs `Tendercrop' (TC) and `Kinghorn Wax' (KW). At 20 °C the breakpoints were 0. 15 gram H 2 O/gram dry weight (<b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram)</b> for TC and 0. 11 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for KW. When seeds were imbibed at 5 °C, the breakpoints were 0. 19 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> (TC) and 0. 16 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> (KW). Below the breakpoint germination changed 4. 6 %/ 0. 01 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for all treatments. Imbibition rates were maximal at 0. 07 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> after 20 minutes imbibition. Rates of electrolyte leakage were correlated with the imbibition rate maximum at 0. 07 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> but were unaffected by the maximum at 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> The transition from tightly bound to semibound water occurred at 0. 09 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and 0. 11 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> for KW and TC, respectively. T 1 values increased exponentially as seed moisture decreased from 0. 47 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> to 0. 05 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram.</b> 13 C-NMR sugar signals increased at {{moisture level}}s above 0. 14 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> and plateaued at approximately 0. 33 <b>gram</b> <b>per</b> <b>gram</b> seed moisture.

Imbibition and leakage rate maxima reflect transitions in the states of seed water. NMR data support the application of the Water Replacement Hypothesis to seeds. Thus, imbibitional injury may be related to specific, temperature dependent moisture levels that are determined by water binding characteristics in the seed tissue...|$|R

5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium and chlorine. Sea {{salt and freshly}} mined salt (much of which is sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 <b>grams</b> <b>per</b> litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of salt, and the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|E
