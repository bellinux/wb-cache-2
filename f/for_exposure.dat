5|$|The {{exposure}} levels to free crystalline silica in the ash {{are commonly used}} to characterise the risk of silicosis in occupational studies (for {{people who work in}} mining, construction and other industries,) because it is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Guideline values have been created <b>for</b> <b>exposure,</b> but with unclear rationale; UK guidelines for particulates in air (PM10) are 50µg/m3 and USA guidelines <b>for</b> <b>exposure</b> to crystalline silica are 50µg/m3. It is thought that the guidelines on {{exposure levels}} could be exceeded for short periods of time without significant health effects on the general population.|$|E
5|$|Early {{researchers}} tasted beryllium and {{its various}} compounds for sweetness {{in order to}} verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt {{should be made to}} ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust (lung cancer is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium-laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in fluorescent lighting tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential <b>for</b> <b>exposure</b> to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.|$|E
5|$|People can {{be exposed}} to hafnium in the {{workplace}} by breathing it in, swallowing it, skin contact, and eye contact. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (Permissible exposure limit) <b>for</b> <b>exposure</b> to hafnium and hafnium compounds in the workplace as TWA 0.5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set the same recommended exposure limit (REL). At levels of 50mg/m3, hafnium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

Targets should be lowered in steps as decontamination proceeded. Targets might differ by region and residents should have a voice in setting the targets.|$|E
25|$|Arrestin linking: The {{phosphorylated}} receptor can {{be linked}} to arrestin molecules that prevent it from binding (and activating) G proteins, in effect switching it off {{for a short period of}} time. This mechanism is used, for example, with rhodopsin in retina cells to compensate <b>for</b> <b>exposure</b> to bright light. In many cases, arrestin's binding to the receptor is a prerequisite for translocation. For example, beta-arrestin bound to β2-adrenoreceptors acts as an adaptor for binding with clathrin, and with the beta-subunit of AP2 (clathrin adaptor molecules); thus, the arrestin here acts as a scaffold assembling the components needed for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of β2-adrenoreceptors.|$|E

25|$|The highest {{background}} radiation in an inhabited area {{is found in}} Ramsar, primarily due {{to the use of}} local naturally radioactive limestone as a building material. The 1000 most exposed residents receive an average external effective radiation dose of 6mSv per year, (0.6 rem/yr,) six times the ICRP recommended limit <b>for</b> <b>exposure</b> to the public from artificial sources. They additionally receive a substantial internal dose from radon. Record radiation levels were found in a house where the effective dose due to ambient radiation fields was 131mSv/a, (13.1 rem/yr) and the internal committed dose from radon was 72mSv/a (7.2 rem/yr). This unique case is over 80 times higher than the world average natural human exposure to radiation.|$|E
25|$|The 2010 National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement (NHIS-OHS) {{identified}} work organization {{factors and}} occupational psychosocial and chemical/physical exposures which may increase some health risks.

25|$|The Tremolite Asbestos Registry {{contains}} {{people who}} lived in or worked in Libby, Montana, while vermiculite was mined there; these people were at risk <b>for</b> <b>exposure</b> to the tremolite asbestos that was naturally occurring in the vermiculite. ATSDR began addressing public health concerns in Libby in 1999 and created the registry in 2004. The purpose of the registry was to monitor the long-term health effects of people in Libby exposed to tremolite asbestos and to assist with communicating important health information to registrants. Researchers have used the registry to study how asbestos exposure affects human health. This research has yielded several important findings. Registry data was used to conduct the first study of the relationship between asbestos exposure and respiratory problems in children. Another study using registry data found a significant relationship between asbestos exposure and death from cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Coccidioidomycosis* is a {{fungal disease}} caused by Coccidioides immitis or Coccidioides posadasii that affects {{a variety of}} species, {{including}} dogs. In dogs signs of primary pulmonary disease include a cough, fever, weight loss, anorexia, and lethargy. Disseminated disease occurs when the fungus has spread outside of the lungs and may include clinical signs such as lameness, pain, seizures, anterior uveitis, and localized swelling. Diagnosis of Valley Fever may include multiple tests, including serology and radiology. According to a study performed in the Tucson and Phoenix area, 28% of dogs will test positive <b>for</b> <b>exposure</b> to the fungus by two years of age, but only 6% of the dogs will be ill with clinical disease. There is {{an increased risk of}} infection associated with amount of time spent outdoors, a larger roaming space accessed by the dog, and increasing age.|$|E
25|$|Healthcare workers {{exposed to}} antineoplastic agents take {{precautions}} {{to keep their}} exposure to a minimum. There is a limitation in cytotoxics dissolution in Australia and the United States to 20 dissolutions per pharmacist/nurse, since pharmacists who prepare these drugs or nurses who may prepare or administer them are the two occupational groups with the highest potential exposure to antineoplastic agents. In addition, physicians and operating room personnel may also be exposed through the treatment of patients. Hospital staff, such as shipping and receiving personnel, custodial workers, laundry workers, and waste handlers, all have potential exposure to these drugs {{during the course of}} their work. The increased use of antineoplastic agents in veterinary oncology also puts these workers at risk <b>for</b> <b>exposure</b> to these drugs. Routes of entry into the worker's body are skin absorption, inhalation, and ingestion via hand-to-mouth. The long-term effects of exposure include chromosomal abnormalities and infertility.|$|E
