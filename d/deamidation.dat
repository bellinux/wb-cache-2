25|$|A {{large number}} of the {{individual}} nucleotides in a tRNA molecule may be chemically modified, often by methylation or <b>deamidation.</b> These unusual bases sometimes affect the tRNA's interaction with ribosomes and sometimes occur in the anticodon to alter base-pairing properties.|$|E
25|$|These {{variants}} {{are typically}} aggregates, <b>deamidation</b> products, glycosylation variants, oxidized amino acid side chains, {{as well as}} amino and carboxyl terminal amino acid additions. These seemingly minute structural changes can affect preclinical stability and process optimization as well as therapeutic product potency, bioavailability and immunogenicity.

50|$|The <b>deamidation</b> {{potential}} for wheats is discussed above. Glutens are {{generated by the}} wheat starch industry. Glutens however {{are more difficult to}} handle once starch and other proteins are removed, for example, alcohol-soluble glutens cannot be mixed with dairy since the alcohol denatures and precipitates dairy proteins. Therefore, gluten is often modified for commercial use by <b>deamidation</b> by treatment with acid at high temperatures, or enzymatic treatment with deamidase or transglutaminases. The increased charge increases the hydrophilicity of gliadins, causing them to stretch out in solution. <b>Deamidation</b> of 20% of glutamine side chains to glutamate suffices to generate a soluble product. This renders gluten soluble enough without alcohol to mix with other products like milk.|$|E

5000|$|The {{catalytic}} {{mechanism for}} crosslinking in human tTG involves the thiol group from a Cys residue {{in the active}} site of tTG. [...] The thiol group attacks the carboxamide of a glutamine residue {{on the surface of}} a protein or peptide substrate, releasing ammonia, and producing a thioester intermediate. The thioester intermediate can then be attacked by the surface amine of a second substrate (typically from a lysine residue). The end product of the reaction is a stable isopeptide bond between the two substrates (i.e. crosslinking). Alternatively, the thioester intermediate can be hydrolyzed, resulting in the net conversion of the glutamine residue to glutamic acid (i.e. <b>deamidation).</b> The <b>deamidation</b> of glutamine residues catalyzed by tTG is thought to be linked to the pathological immune response to gluten in celiac disease. [...] A schematic for the crosslinking and the <b>deamidation</b> reactions is provided in Figure 1.|$|E
50|$|The <b>deamidation</b> of {{pyrazinamide}} to pyrazinoic acid (assumed to be {{the active}} component of the drug pyrazinamide) in four days is a useful physiologic characteristic by which M. tuberculosis-complex members can be distinguished.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deamidation</b> is the {{reaction}} {{by which a}} glutamate residue is formed by cleavage of the epsilon-amino group of a glutamine side chain. Transamidation, which occurs three times more often than <b>deamidation,</b> is the cross-linking of a glutamine residue from the gliadin peptide to a lysine residue of tTg in a reaction which is catalysed by the transglutaminase. Crosslinking may occur either within or outside the active site of the enzyme. The latter case yields a permanently covalently linked complex between the gliadin and the tTg. This results {{in the formation of}} new epitopes which are believed to trigger the primary immune response by which the autoantibodies against tTg develop.|$|E
50|$|The {{immunodominant site}} for DQ2.5 is on α2-gliadin. The {{site is a}} {{protease}} resistant 33mer that has 6 overlapping DQ2.5 restricted epitopes. This creates very strong binding of T-cells for DQ2.5-33mer complexes. DQ2.5 binds gliadin, but the binding is sensitive to <b>deamidation</b> caused by tissue transglutaminase. In almost all case the highest affinity sites of gluten are derived by <b>deamidation.</b> The HLA DQB1*0202 and its linked DQA1* alleles (the DQ2.2 haplotype) do not produce the α5 subunit. While the DQ2.2 heterodimer cannot effectively present α-2 gliadin, it can present other gliadins. In at least 1% of coeliacs DQ2.2 confers adaptive immunity to gliadin permitting coeliac disease.|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>deamidation</b> of an {{asparagine}} residue under physiological conditions, {{the side}} chain is {{attacked by the}} nitrogen atom of the following peptide group (in black at top right of Figure), forming an asymmetric succinimide intermediate (in red). The asymmetry of the intermediate results in two products of its hydrolysis, either aspartic acid (in black at left) or isoaspartic acid, which is a beta amino acid (in green at bottom right). The <b>deamidation</b> of a glutamine residue may proceed via the same mechanism but at a much slower rate since formation of the six-member-ring glutarimide intermediate is less favoured than the succinimide intermediate for asparagine.|$|E
50|$|MCPs undergo two {{covalent}} modifications: <b>deamidation</b> and reversible methylation at {{a number}} of glutamate residues. Attractants increase the level of methylation, while repellents decrease it. The methyl groups are added by the methyl-transferase CheR and are removed by the methylesterase CheB.|$|E
5000|$|... tTG {{also has}} GTPase activity: In the {{presence}} of GTP, it suggested {{to function as a}} G protein participating in signaling processes. Besides its transglutaminase activity, tTG is proposed to also act as kinase, and protein disulfide isomerase, and deamidase. This latter activity is important in the <b>deamidation</b> of gliadin peptides, thus playing important role in the pathology of coeliac disease.|$|E
50|$|Tissue {{transglutaminase}} modifies gluten peptides into a {{form that}} may stimulate the immune system more effectively. These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways, <b>deamidation</b> or transamidation. Modern anti-tTG assays rely on a human recombinant protein as an antigen. tTG testing should be done first as it is an easier test to perform. An equivocal result on tTG testing should be followed by anti-endomysial antibodies.|$|E
5000|$|Another mode of RLC {{modulation}} lies in {{its ability}} to be modified by phosphorylation and <b>deamidation</b> in the N-terminal region, resulting in significant charge alterations of the protein. RLC is phosphorylated by a cardiac-specific myosin light chain kinase (MYLK3), which was recently cloned. Studies have supported a role for myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 2 (MYPT2,PPP1R12B) in the dephosphorylation of RLC. Human RLC has an Asparagine at position 14 (Threonine in mouse) and a Serine at position 15 (same in mouse). Endogenous RLC exists as a mixture of unmodified (typically ~50%), singly-modified (either N14 <b>deamidation</b> or S15 phosphorylation) and doubly modified (N14 <b>deamidation</b> and S15 phosphorylation) protein. Both <b>deamidation</b> and phosphorylation contribute negative charge to the N-terminal region of RLC, undoubtedly altering its interaction with the C-terminal myosin alpha helical domain. Functional studies have supported a role for RLC phosphorylation in modulating cardiac myosin crossbridge kinetics. It is well established that RLC phosphorylation enhances myofilament sensitivity to calcium in isometrically-contracting, skinned cardiac fibers. It was also demonstrated that a lack of RLC phosphorylation decreases tension cost (isometric force/ATPase rate at a given pCa), suggesting that RLC phosphorylation augments cycling kinetics of myosin. It has been proposed that RLC phosphorylation promotes a [...] "swing-out" [...] of myosin heads, facilitating weak-to-strong crossbridge binding to actin per unit calcium. Additional insights regarding RLC phosphorylation in beating hearts have come from in vivo studies. Adult mice expressing a non-phosphorylatable cardiac RLC (TG-RLC(P-)) exhibited significant decreases in load-dependent and load-independent measures of contractility. In TG-RLC(P-), the time for the heart to reach peak elastance during ejection was elongated, ejection capacity was decreased and the inotropic response to dobutamine was blunted. It is also clear that ablation of RLC phosphorylation in vivo induces alterations in the phosphorylation of other sarcomeric proteins, namely cardiac myosin binding protein C and cardiac troponin I. Moreover, RLC phosphorylation, specifically, appears to be necessary for a normal inotropic response to dobutamine. In agreement with these findings, a second in vivo model, cardiac myosin light chain kinase (MYLK3) knockout (cMLCK neo/neo), showed depressed fractional shortening, progressing to left ventricular hypertrophy by 4-5 months of age. Taken together, these studies clearly demonstrate that RLC phosphorylation regulates cardiac dynamics in beating hearts, and is critical for eliciting a normal sympathetic response.|$|E
50|$|Anti-transglutaminase {{antibodies}} to the enzyme tissue transglutaminase (tTG) {{are found in}} the blood of the majority of people with classic symptoms and complete villous atrophy, but only in 70% of the cases with partial villous atrophy and 30% of the cases with minor mucosal lesions. Tissue transglutaminase modifies gluten peptides into a form that may stimulate the immune system more effectively. These peptides are modified by tTG in two ways, <b>deamidation</b> or transamidation.|$|E
50|$|The pool of MBP in {{the central}} nervous system is very diverse, with several splice {{variants}} being expressed and a large number of post-translational modifications on the protein, which include phosphorylation, methylation, <b>deamidation,</b> and citrullination. These forms differ by the presence or the absence of short (10 to 20 residues) peptides in various internal locations in the sequence. In general, the major form of MBP is a protein of about 18.5 Kd (170 residues).|$|E
50|$|Endonuclease V (endoV) is {{a highly}} conserved {{endonuclease}} enzyme family. The primary function of endoV differs significantly in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as suggested by studies on the E. coli and human orthologs. In prokaryotes endoV is primarily a deoxyribonuclease involved in DNA repair of deoxyinosine introduced into the genome by <b>deamidation</b> of adenine bases. However, it has broad substrate specificity and can also act on other types of DNA lesions {{as well as on}} inosine-containing RNA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deamidation</b> is a {{chemical}} reaction {{in which an}} amide functional group in the side chain of the amino acids asparagine or glutamine is removed or converted to another functional group. Typically, asparagine is converted to aspartic acid or isoaspartic acid. Glutamine is converted to glutamic acid or pyroglutamic acid (5-oxoproline). In a protein or peptide, these reactions are important because they may alter its structure, stability or function and may lead to protein degradation. The resulting mass adduct is a +1 Da shift.|$|E
50|$|Regarding the {{function}} of NGLY1, {{it has been shown}} that the enzyme is involved in the ER-associated degradation (ERAD), one of the ER quality control/homeostasis systems for newly synthesized glycoproteins. The functional importance of NGLY1 in the ERAD process, however, is not clearly understood. It has also been suggested that NGLY1 is closely involved in MHC class I-mediated antigen presentation. The Ngly1-mediated (glycosylated) Asn-to-Asp <b>deamidation</b> constitutes, together with other reactions such as transpeptidation, unconventional post-translational modifications for antigenic peptides that are presented by MHC class I molecules.|$|E
50|$|These {{variants}} {{are typically}} aggregates, <b>deamidation</b> products, glycosylation variants, oxidized amino acid side chains, {{as well as}} amino and carboxyl terminal amino acid additions.

50|$|Prolamins and to {{a lesser}} degree {{glutelins}} are excellent substrates for <b>deamidation</b> particularly by mammalian tissue transglutaminases (tTG). <b>Deamidation</b> is a process in which the R-C0-NH2 portion of glutamines (or asparagine) is hydrolyzed to R-CO-OH forming glutamic acid or aspartic acid. In gliadin, the -QQP-, -QVP-, -QLP-, -QYP- tripeptides in the context of favorable adjacent peptides are readily deamidated. Most proteins have few or no such transglutaminase sites; however alpha gliadin has 13 such sites. Human tissue transglutaminase not only deamidates gliadin, but it also crosslinks itself to gliadin, which has immunological consequences. Gliadin also has a small peptide that appears to alter the distribution of transglutaminase in the gut but is not crosslinked, the mechanism of its 'innate' behavior is not clear. tTG also crosslinks gliadin to other proteins via these sites, generating anti-food responses, anti-self protein responses, and self-crossreactive responses to food proteins that result in secondary autoimmunities. The role of tTG in the extracellular matrix is to crosslink lysine side chains of proteins such as collagen to proteins, however glutens appear to infiltrate into the small intestine, interfering with this process and resulting in a false immune recognition of the matrix and surrounding cells as foreign, leading, ultimately, tothe destruction of the intestinal mucosa. Seeds of certain plants may elicit the innate and cellular responses as a defensive response to overconsumption of seeds.|$|E
5000|$|Isoaspartic acid (isoaspartate) is an {{amino acid}} {{that is an}} isomer of aspartic acid. It is formed via a {{chemical}} reaction in which the nitrogen atom of the following peptide group (in black at top right of Figure 1) nucleophilically attacks the γ-carbon of the side chain of an asparagine or aspartic acid residue, forming a symmetric succinimide intermediate (in red). Hydrolysis of the intermediate results in two products, either aspartic acid (in black at left) or isoaspartic acid, which is a β-amino acid (in green at bottom right). [...] The reaction also results in the <b>deamidation</b> of the asparagine residue. Racemization may occur leading {{to the formation of}} D-aminoacids.|$|E
50|$|Insulin glargine has a {{substitution}} of glycine for asparagine at N21 (Asn21) and two arginines {{added to the}} carboxy terminal of B chain. The arginine amino acids shifts the isoelectric point from a pH of 5.4 to 6.7, making the molecule more soluble at an acidic pH and less soluble at physiological pH. The isoelectric shift also allows for the subcutaneous injection of a clear solution. The glycine substitution prevents <b>deamidation</b> of the acid-sensitive asparagine at acidic pH. In the neutral subcutaneous space, higher-order aggregates form, resulting in a slow, peakless dissolution and absorption of insulin {{from the site of}} injection. It can achieve a peakless level for at least 24 hours.|$|E
50|$|Citrullinated {{peptides}} and proteins can {{be detected}} using antibodies targeting the citrullinated residues, or detected using mass spectrometry-based proteomics technologies. Citrullination of arginine results in a monoisotopic mass increase of +0.984016 Da, which can be measured with mass spectrometry. The mass shift {{is close to the}} mass difference between the different peptide isotopes of +1.008665 which can be mistaken for a citrullinated peptide, especially on low-resolution instruments. However, this is less of an issue with modern high resolution/high accuracy mass spectrometers. Furthermore, the mass shift is identical to the mass shift caused by <b>deamidation</b> of the amino acid asparagine or glutamine side chain, which are common modifications. Different strategies are being used to help correctly differentiate between citrullinations and deamidations in proteomics.|$|E
50|$|The {{covalent}} {{attachment to}} the tRNA 3’ end is catalyzed by enzymes called aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. During protein synthesis, tRNAs with attached amino acids are delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors, which aid in association of the tRNA with the ribosome, synthesis of the new polypeptide and translocation (movement) of the ribosome along the mRNA. If the tRNA's anticodon matches the mRNA, another tRNA already bound to the ribosome transfers the growing polypeptide chain from its 3’ end to the amino acid attached to the 3’ end of the newly delivered tRNA, a reaction catalyzed by the ribosome.A large number of the individual nucleotides in a tRNA molecule may be chemically modified, often by methylation or <b>deamidation.</b> These unusual bases sometimes affect the tRNA's interaction with ribosomes and sometimes occur in the anticodon to alter base-pairing properties.|$|E
5000|$|Tissue {{transglutaminase}} (abbreviated as tTG or TG2) is a 78-kDa, calcium-dependent enzyme (...) of the protein-glutamine γ-glutamyltransferases family (or simply transglutaminase family). Like other transglutaminases, it crosslinks proteins {{between an}} ε-amino group of a lysine residue and a γ-carboxamide group of glutamine residue, creating an inter- or intramolecular bond {{that is highly}} resistant to proteolysis (protein degradation). Aside from its crosslinking function, tTG catalyzes other types of reactions including <b>deamidation,</b> GTP-binding/hydrolyzing, and isopeptidase activities. [...] Unlike {{other members of the}} transglutaminase family, tTG can be found both in the intracellular and the extracellular spaces of various types of tissues and is found in many different organs including the heart, the liver, and the small intestine. Intracellular tTG is abundant in the cytosol but smaller amounts can also be found in the nucleus and the mitochondria. [...] Intracellular tTG is thought {{to play an important role}} in apoptosis. In the extracellular space, tTG binds to proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM), binding particularly tightly to fibronectin. [...] Extracellular tTG has been linked to cell adhesion, ECM stabilization, wound healing, receptor signaling, cellular proliferation, and cellular motility.|$|E
40|$|Every {{asparagine}} {{in every}} protein undergoes nonenzymatic <b>deamidation</b> to aspartate or isoaspartate {{at a rate}} determined by the surrounding protein structure and cellular environment. Under physiologic conditions, the <b>deamidation</b> half-life of individual asparagines in proteins is proposed to range from {{less than a day}} to several centuries. More than 200 proteins have been shown to undergo <b>deamidation</b> to a meaningful degree, and modeling predicts that hundreds more undergo <b>deamidation</b> at rates that have the potential to be of biological consequence. Because <b>deamidation</b> converts an asparagine into an aspartate or isoaspartate, it introduces a negative charge into a protein and results in the isomerization of a residue. Therefore, <b>deamidation</b> has the potential to change protein function. Additionally, <b>deamidation</b> is thought to render some proteins more susceptible to degradation. In most instances in which asparagine <b>deamidation</b> has been identified in vivo, it is involved in pathology. Hence, <b>deamidation</b> has been viewed primarily as a form of protein damage. However, the pervasiveness and evolutionary persistence of these unstable asparagines suggest that they may have a beneficial role. Notably, the change of even a single neighboring amino acid can have a marked effect on the rate of <b>deamidation</b> of an asparagine. Therefore, the underlying rate of <b>deamidation</b> of any asparagine is genetically programmable. This characteristic, combined with the wide range of <b>deamidation</b> rates that can be programmed, imparts to asparagines the potential to serve as molecular timers that regulate protein function and stability...|$|E

The effect of specific sites of <b>deamidation</b> on crystallin stability in vivo is not known. Using mass spectrometry, a previously unreported <b>deamidation</b> in βB 1 -crystallin was identified at Gln 146. Another <b>deamidation</b> was investigated at Asn 157. It {{was determined that}} whole soluble βB 1 contained 13 %– 17 % <b>deamidation</b> at Gln 146 and Asn 157. Static and quasi-elastic laser light scattering, circular dichroism, and heat aggregation studies were used to explore the structure and associative properties of recombinantly expressed wild-type (wt) βB 1 and the deamidated βB 1 mutants, Q 146 E and N 157 D. Dimer formation occurred for wt βB 1, Q 146 E, and N 157 D in a concentration-dependent manner, but only Q 146 E showed formation of higher ordered oligomers at the concentrations studied. <b>Deamidation</b> at Gln 146, but not Asn 157, led to an increased tendency of βB 1 to aggregate upon heating. We conclude that <b>deamidation</b> creates unique effects depending upon where the <b>deamidation</b> is introduced in the crystallin structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{rates of}} <b>deamidation</b> of α-synuclein and single Asn {{residues}} in 13 Asn-sequence mutants have been measured for 5 × 10 − 5 M protein {{in both the}} absence and presence of 10 − 2 M sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In the course of these experiments, 370 quantitative protein <b>deamidation</b> measurements were performed and 37 <b>deamidation</b> rates were determined by ion cyclotron resonance Fourier transform mass spectrometry, using an improved whole protein isotopic envelope method and a mass defect method with both enzymatic and collision-induced fragmentation. The measured <b>deamidation</b> index of α-synuclein {{was found to be}} 0. 23 for an overall <b>deamidation</b> half-time of 23 days, without or with SDS micelles, owing primarily to the <b>deamidation</b> of Asn(103) and Asn(122). <b>Deamidation</b> rates of 15 Asn residues in the wild-type and mutant proteins were found to be primary sequence controlled without SDS. However, the presence of SDS micelles slowed the <b>deamidation</b> rates of nine N-terminal region Asn residues, caused by the known three-dimensional structures induced through protein binding to SDS micelles...|$|E
40|$|<b>Deamidation</b> of {{glutamine}} (Q) and asparagine (N) {{has been}} recognized as a marker of degradation and aging in ancient proteins. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to study <b>deamidation</b> in wool textiles, we identified eight peptides from α-keratin proteins in sheep wool that could potentially be {{used to assess the}} level of degradation. For each chosen peptide, the extent of <b>deamidation</b> was determined by comparing the calculated theoretical distribution with the measured distribution using a genetic algorithm that gives the best fit to the measured distribution. Variations in the levels of <b>deamidation</b> were observed between peptides and in modern wool samples buried for up to 8 years in which <b>deamidation</b> levels were relatively low under short-term burial. In contrast, <b>deamidation</b> was higher in archeological textile fragments from medieval sites ranging from the 9 th to 13 th century in York (United Kingdom) and Newcastle (United Kingdom) and from the 13 th to 16 th century in Reykholt (Iceland). Major differences were observed between the British and the Icelandic samples, showing a negative correlation between age of samples and levels of <b>deamidation,</b> but highlighting the effect of local environment. In addition, nanoscale liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS) data indicated that <b>deamidation</b> in wool's α-keratin was influenced by primary and higher-order structures.
