5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he has done in the past two days. Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> flashes back again to when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property and parked near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E

They could hear crying and screaming from other cells. Police doctors at the facility also participated in the torture, using ritual humiliation, threats of rape and deprivation of water, food, sleep and medical care. A prisoner named Richard Moth was given stitches <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> legs without anaesthetics, which made the procedure painful.|$|E
25|$|Pepe Sánchez, born José Sánchez (18561918), {{is known}} as the father of the trova style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. He had no formal {{training}} in music. With remarkable natural talent, he composed numbers <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost for ever, though some two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples transcribed them. His first bolero, Tristezas, is still remembered today. He also created advertisement jingles before radio was born. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed him.|$|E
25|$|The {{force had}} navigated fairly far up river {{when they came}} under {{unexpected}} fire from Spanish Florida. The British soon silenced the fire, but Phillott decided to retreat as the river ahead was narrow (only 30 to 40 yards wide), with commanding heights and houses to their rear. During the withdrawal, the expedition was exposed to harassing fire for over ten hours. In all, the expedition cost the British three men killed and 15 wounded. Bartholomew, of Erebus, was hit four times. He took his first hit <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> then a second ball hit his middle finger and thumb when {{he put his hand}} up to feel the first wound. He was also hit in the neck and throat. Phillott too was wounded twice.|$|E

500|$|David Fricke of the Rolling Stone in {{a review}} of ¡Uno! {{compared}} the theme of the song with [...] "Stay the Night", another song on the album, stating; [...] "'Stay the Night' and 'Let Yourself Go' are the kind of pop-smart here's-my-fucking-problem miniatures Armstrong was writing like second nature when he, Dirnt and Cool were too young to drink (legally) where they gigged. But Armstrong is 40 now, married and a dad, and a lot of this ruckus sounds designed to drown out the time bombs ticking <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> the maddening static outside".|$|E
500|$|The episodes {{produced}} by Johnson and Vincent included Dr. Mercy exploiting a 125-year-old Civil War veteran {{and dealing with}} a strike by the doctors and nurses. Another episode saw Noland create a mythical patient and then claim that the patient died, {{the cause of death}} being the result of a lack of cardiac crash carts on each floor of the hospital. Johnson and Vincent's favorite episode was one where the X-rays of a professional footballer are misread, resulting in him being placed by mistake in [...] "Crutchfield's Traction", in which holes are drilled <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> tongs inserted in them.|$|E

A young Horatio Nelson was serving in the West Indies at the time, and wrote to his friend and patron William Locker about the captures, noting that William Williams, commander of Active had also died shortly afterwards, apparently of a broken heart. The heavy British losses at the time speeded Nelson's own promotion, and he was made master and commander of the brig [...] on 8 December 1778.|$|E

500|$|Most of the songs' lyrics {{were not}} written down on paper, as Timberlake {{believed}} {{it would only}} slow him down. For most of the album's production, Timberlake composed the lyrics <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> would record the song shortly after. Some songs were conceptualized within a relatively shorter time, while others took longer because Timberlake had wanted to incorporate variation. For instance, the lyrics to [...] "Losing My Way" [...] were in a narrative style which took Timberlake longer to write. The only song that Timberlake wrote down on paper was the Rick Rubin-produced [...] "(Another Song) All Over Again". Rubin felt it was unusual for Timberlake because he requested the latter to write the lyrics first instead of recording it directly in the vocal booth.|$|E

500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine.

[...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It {{never occurred to me}} in a million years that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ...

500|$|While Butcher contributed about a {{third of}} the album's lyrics, most of the music on Loveless was written and {{performed}} by Shields. Shields stated, [...] "I'm actually the only musician on the record except for the Colm song [...]" [...] Shields assumed Butcher's guitarist duties during the recording process; Butcher admitted that she had not minded because she felt she [...] "was never a great guitarist". Bassist Debbie Googe did not perform on the album, though she received a credit on the album sleeve. Googe said, [...] "At the beginning I used to go down [...] most days but after a while I began to feel pretty superfluous so I went down less." [...] Butcher explained, [...] "for Kevin to actually translate to Debbie what he had <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> play it right would have been an agonizing process." [...] "It wasn't collaborative at all", Alan Moulder said of the album's recording. [...] "Kevin had a clear view of what he wanted, but he never explained it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "John Doe" [...] was co-executive MacLaren's directorial debut. Although she {{had never}} helmed an episode before, MacLaren {{utilized}} information that she had gathered by working with Kim Manners, one of the series' prolific directors. She later noted, [...] "Kim taught me how he breaks down a script and prepares his shot list. The most powerful thing {{he said to me}} was that he imagines the show all cut together and sees the movie <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> really visualizes it." [...] Gilligan later said that MacLaren [...] "really rose to the occasion and really did her homework." [...] The bus crash scene was created with the use of elaborate [...] "smoke and mirrors", according to Gilligan. Over nine cameras were used to film the entire scene. Several of the cameras were under-cranked in order to give the illusion that the bus was going faster than it really was. A steel ramp was buried in the ground to flip the bus. However, the scene was reportedly torpid to film. Gilligan later joked that [...] "You could have stood there and had a sandwich while the thing was backing up: it was so slow." ...|$|E

50|$|Her ideas {{concerning}} {{performance are}} shaped by a fidelity to compositional intent. Peris stated in 2012, “For me, now, music is about conveying what the composer had <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart, <b>head</b> <b>and</b> soul. <b>His</b> moods, his feelings.” Her playing has been noted for its tonal color, sensitive phrasing and technical expertise.|$|R
500|$|Zooropa {{producer}} Flood {{said that}} [...] "Zooropa" [...] {{was one of}} his favourite songs on the album, along with [...] "Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car", [...] "The First Time", and [...] "Numb". Mullen felt that the song was [...] "absolutely mesmerizing". Following the release of [...] "Zooropa", references to the song have appeared in professional writings and in other media. [...] On the day of the U2 concert in Sarajevo during the PopMart Tour in 1997, tour set designer Willie Williams wrote about waking up that day with [...] "Zooropa" [...] playing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> stated that Sarajevo [...] "is the city of Zooropa, if there ever was one." [...] José Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, quoted the song's lyrics at a 2005 press conference after enlisting Bono {{in an effort to get}} governments in the European Union to give more money to developing countries, [...] and stated that the lyrics inspired an article he wrote about the future of Europe.

500|$|While {{the team}} investigates several pathologies {{to fit the}} bus driver's condition, House overdoses on his Vicodin and starts to hallucinate. He finds himself back on the bus, where he sees a woman (Ivana Miličević) who {{was not on the}} bus. However, before House can speak to her, Wilson awakens him to do an MRI on him. When House returns to the bus hallucination, Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) is with him. As they discuss the bus driver's {{possible}} diseases, House realizes they are <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> tells Cuddy to accompany the discussion with a strip tease. Cuddy complies, but just before she takes off her bra, she notes that she is distracting House and stops stripping. The woman from House's earlier hallucination returns and introduces herself as [...] "the answer". She tells House to look at the bus driver's shuffling feet, which House believes to indicate Parkinson's disease. When the bus driver needs to be intubated due to a possible clot from a pulmonary embolism, House notices the driver's recent dental work. He reasons that an air bubble being accidentally injected into the patient's bloodstream through the gums would explain all the symptoms, so the bubble is extracted and the patient is saved. House believes the case to be over, but a dream that night causes him to realize that the bus driver is not the patient he saw suffering from symptoms; the crash merely dislodged the air bubble and caused the driver's problems.|$|E
