5|$|Defense {{accounts}} contradicted {{the testimony}} of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with <b>his</b> <b>pistol</b> first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to <b>his</b> <b>pistol</b> to continue firing.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday {{himself had}} a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One {{of the women}} who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been {{discharged}} from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with <b>his</b> <b>pistol.</b> As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew <b>his</b> <b>pistol</b> and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday.|$|E
5|$|Virgil Earp was {{not expecting}} a fight. Once Behan said that he'd {{disarmed}} the Cowboys, Virgil traded the short, double-barreled shotgun {{he was carrying}} for Holliday's cane. Virgil carried the cane {{in his right hand}} and shifted the pistol in his waistband from the right side to his left. Holliday concealed the short shotgun under his long jacket. Wyatt too was not expecting a fight and put <b>his</b> <b>pistol</b> in his overcoat pocket.|$|E

As he leaned against the glass, Rupert {{discharged}} both <b>his</b> <b>pistols</b> into <b>his</b> body, and then, leaping up, dashed in the window, and leapt over the man's body into the room.|$|R

However, the magistrates had been informed and the men were arrested before the duel could take place.|$|E
5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it.

5|$|At E3 2006, Origins was {{announced}} as in development by Climax Studios, instead of by Konami's Team Silent who had developed previous installments. The first previews {{of the game}} featured {{a departure from the}} third-person view typical of the series to a Resident Evil 4-style camera angle, and an emphasis on action and combat to a greater degree than the previous installments in the series. In the previews, Travis had six weapons, divided equally between melee weapons and firearms. Additional changes included a laser sight for <b>his</b> <b>pistol</b> and an option for the player to barricade areas. At the time, the game was expected to be released in late 2006.|$|E

After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took <b>his</b> <b>pistol</b> at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the {{position}} held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the impetus to advance. This bought time for Indian forces to fly into Srinagar airfield and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar itself. During the battle, along with Sharma, one junior commissioned officer and 20 other ranks of D company were killed. Sharma's body was recovered three days later. Though it was disfigured beyond recognition, his body was identified {{by means of the}} leather holster of <b>his</b> <b>pistol</b> and a few pages of Bhagavad Gita in his breast pocket.|$|E
5|$|Scott Gorman (William Hope) is {{commanding}} officer of the mission to LV-426, and the Colonial Marines do not take kindly to the inexperienced lieutenant.

Ripley takes over, driving the command vehicle, and Gorman is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he transfers command of the colony's defense to Hicks. During the Aliens' assault on the operations room, Gorman tries to rescue Vasquez but <b>his</b> <b>pistol</b> runs out of ammunition. Realizing they are trapped, they embrace and detonate a grenade (taking a number of Aliens with them).|$|E
