Every element of language is integrated in the grammatical structure on a qualitative and a quantitative basis: qualitatively, it is defined by the <b>double</b> <b>dichotomy</b> of morphology versus syntax and symbol versus logic; quantitatively or formally, it is defined by the structural principles for differences and similarities between elements. Thus, the defining notions of Brøndal's doctrine cover that area which in other theories is defined by notions developed in connection with the sign.|$|E

The primary results from the study of 845 couples in the general population suggest that there exists a significant spouse-similarity across the various mental health dimensions examined (psychological distress, general well-being, and role satisfaction). The main results from the study of 17 couples in marital therapy suggest that significant sex differences exist in dyadic adjustment. Sex differences were also noted in the correlations between dyadic adjustment and depressive symptoms.

40|$|Three of the {{potential}} models for the 2 x 2 contingency table are discussed: the hyper geometric Independence Trial, the double-binomial Comparative Trial, and the multinomial <b>Double</b> <b>Dichotomy</b> Trial. Then the critical re-gions of seven statistical tests are evaluated within each of these models. The uncorrected Pearson s Chi-Square test and Upton's correction {{are found to be}} overly liberal in all three models, particularly for the hyper geometric. A continuity correction, when properly applied, is shown to be an extremely good approximation to Fisher's Exact test, which employs the hypergeo-metric distribution to evaluate outcome probabilities—but is an extremely conservative approximation to the double binomial and multinomial mod-els. Haber's test is recommended for these two cases, but the amount of work required may be prohibitive for many investigators. Despite the long, extensive literature {{on the use of the}} chi-square test of independence in 2 x 2 contingency tables, the argument as to the appropri-ateness of a continuity correction continues (e. g., Yates, 1984). Regarding 2 x 2 tables, some statistical texts recommend against using Yates's (1934) correction because it tends to be overly conservative (e. g., Conover, 1980, p. 149; Sachs, 1984, p. 351), and others argue even more emphatically that "the correction should always be used " (e. g., Fleiss, 1981, p. 27).

40|$|Antirrhinum majus flowers, {{similarly}} {{to those of}} many other groups, comprise four types of organs, sepals, petals, stamens and carpels, which arise sequentially in the flanks of dome-shaped floral meristems. Following a radial axis of the flower, organs are therefore organized in concentric whorls. In addition to this radial pattern, the various organs within each whorl also adopt different identities according to their positions along a dorsoventral axis. The dorsoventral pattern is such that the flower has only one plane of bilateral symmetry coinciding with the dorsoventral axis. In this work. mechanisms by which these patterns are established are investigated by the analysis of mutants in which differences along the radial or the dorsoventral axes are reduced. In one of the mutants considered, alien, the internal part of the pistil, which develops later during {{the formation of the}} radial pattern, is specifically affected, with petals and stamens developing at the place of the placenta. Analysis of the patterns of expression of other genes controlling the radial pattern, in the alien mutant, indicates that the alien gene is a late-acting determinant of pistil development. The study of mutants in which the dorsoventral pattern is affected, indicates that two genes, cycloidea and dichotomy, determine dorsal identities and dorsoventral asymmetry. Flowers in which both genes are inactivated, as those from <b>double</b> cycloidea; <b>dichotomy</b> mutants, are radially symmetric with all members within whorls adopting ventral identities. The analysis of mutant combinations further indicates that these dorsal genes act negatively on divaricata, a gene controlling ventral identitiesAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|Plantain {{is a major}} {{staple food}} in the humid tropics of Africa {{providing}} more than 25 % of the carbohydrates required by about 70 million people. In addition to being an important staple food for rural and urban consumers, plantain provides {{an important source of}} revenue for smallholders who produce them in compounds or home gardens as well as in large-scale field production. In Nigeria three main plantain cultivars are grown; the French plantain the Horn plantain and the Falsehorn plantain. Each of these cultivars produces only one bunch of fruit and yet some farmers in Eastern Nigeria claim to have a plantain 'type' that produced two bunches at fruiting. A scientist from the Department of Crop Science of the University of Nigeria, conducted a survey in Southern Nigeria into the incidence of a phenomenon known as 'double bunching'. While the centre of origin or concentration of this plantain 'type' cannot yet be pinned down to any particular location of Southern Nigeria, it was observed that double-bunching was found in every part of Southern Nigeria where plantain is primarily cultivated. The reason for this <b>double</b> bunching, or <b>dichotomy,</b> is still unknown but it was observed that some 50 % of the suckers from double-bunching plantains reverted back to single bunching. The initial investigation has thrown up some interesting questions that need further research such as: - Is dichotomy of genetic origin, that is through mutation of the existing plantain cultivars? - Is the dichotomous plantain a naturally occurring but endangered plantain 'types that has not been noted scientifically nor fully domesticated and multiplied for wider cultivation? - Are there certain environmental factors (especially nutritional) that could induce dichotomy in plantain? The researchers are interested in proposals or funding that would enable more research to be conducted into the preservation and development of this potentially useful plantain.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that almost all of the largest economies in the world are already {{dominated}} by services. What may be less well known is that many are also evolving towards becoming information economies in the sense of both value added (GNP) and jobs. Of course, this evolution is less advanced in some countries, but the US is already well past the 60 % mark in terms of value added. We further explore the confluence of these two trends, by examining the <b>double</b> <b>dichotomy</b> of products versus services and information versus material (non-information) which divides the economy into four super-sectors. We do this by analyzing data on US GNP in 1992 and 1997 and the US job market (employment and wage rates by 821 occupational categories) in 1999. The main conclusions are that the US job market is also dominated by information work, that the largest part of the US economy in terms of GNP value added (in 1997) is the “information services ” super-sector, that the largest job share {{in terms of the number}} of jobs is in the “physical or non-information ” jobs in services but the largest share of the wage bill (in 1999) is in information related jobs in services. Interestingly, the highest level of wages per worker is in information intensive tasks in products. We discuss some of the possible reasons for these trends, and also discuss the major differences between information and non-information sectors, that have potentially large implications for management and policy decisions...|$|E
40|$|The Official Histories of the Second World War are {{the largest}} historiographical project in New Zealand's history. They are still used as core {{reference}} texts for individual battles and for the war as a whole. The War Histories were intended to fill {{a wide range of}} roles. They were to be 'at once a memorial, a souvenir, an interpretation of events and a record of experience in certain specialised fields'. The conflicting nature of these roles created a <b>double</b> <b>dichotomy</b> within the War History project, between an affirmative national memory and an empirically accurate history {{on the one hand and}} between the critical evaluation of campaigns and the recognition of service and sacrifice on the other. This thesis examines this dichotomy through a framework of memory, history, nation and war. It uses four case studies from the War History series, Journey towards Christmas, by S. P. Llewellyn, 23 Battalion, by Angus Ross, Crete, by Dan Davin and Battle for Egypt, the Summer of 1942, by J. L. Scoullar, to consider the extent to which the tensions between the roles of the Histories influenced their production and their place as contemporary histories in post-war New Zealand. While the War Histories represent the largest repository of information on New Zealand in World War Two, the thesis contends that to use the series now as reference works only is to miss a significant opportunity. The War Histories were Official, but they were also contemporary and collective in their production. Each volume in the series is a valuable historical text in its own right, and can be read and deconstructed as representative of both the individual and society that produced it...|$|E
40|$|The twentieth-century {{has been}} dubbed the century of anti-Platonism by Badiou, a {{contemporary}} French philosopher. He identifies six strains of anti-Platonism: the vitalist, analytic, Marxist, existentialist, Heideggerian and “ordinary political philosophy. ” My research responds to these interpretations: in order to illustrate the dialectic between the past and present, I situate my work within the “affective turn,” one of the currents in critical theory. In my dissertation “One Hundred and One Nights: Plato and the Metaphysical Feminine,” I reassess Plato’s stance towards the realm of becoming and {{see it as a}} feminine space, for the female body resides in his politics as the materialization of desire and the embodying of aspirations. It is with this approach that I make an intervention in the scholarly debate known as “Plato’s Feminism:” I elucidate gendered spaces in the utopian paradigm and demonstrate that political discourses are gendered discourses. I look at the points of contact and disagreement among Plato’s utopian dialogues, Republic, Laws and Timaeus, and, in my examination of the different textures of the ideal city, trace his gendered line of thought in the images, metaphors and analogies of the narrative. I use Deleuze’s theory of cinema in Cinema 1 : The Movement-Image and Cinema 2 : The Time-Image as a hermeneutic model to locate the vital feminine principle of becoming, which I believe to be operative in the ancient texts. My work thus combines theoretical, literary and philological methodologies and is interested in an issue of enhancement: I proceed to show, by periodic demonstrations, that my philological answers verify the theoretical questions and categories that I pose as initiating them, that each depends upon and enhances the other. Ultimately what I try to magnify in Plato’s thought is a <b>double</b> <b>dichotomy,</b> the bones and structure of binary oppositions: on the one hand, a set of neat micro-definitions, exemplified by the realm of the forms and the neutral, to kalon, for instance, and, on the other, the cacophony of muthoi, in other words, the realm of flux, language and meta-language. Because language is not pure—it is structured and manipulated, put under great stress since it expresses the world of appearance, and produces gendered bridges and divisions—Plato has to revert to fiction, noble lies and bodily metaphors to describe any reality, phenomenal or ideal. I focus on this vulnerability in Plato in his utopian dialogues and argue that he offers a theory of politics based on mimēsis and an aesthetics of politics, made tangible by what I identify to be a cinematic narrative, which gives impressions of movement, time, fluidity and psychic contortions of all kinds. I take an interdisciplinary approach in order to show Plato not as a negative-polarity to the contemporary period but as a rather modern thinker, more than relevant to the present day...|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that {{scientific research and}} science, technology and innovation (STI) policies within the US and the EU have gone through deep changes for about 30 years. Many scholars from science and technology studies and innovation studies have investigated these policy changes, and the publication of “The New Production of Knowledge” (Gibbons et al., 1994) {{paved the way for}} vigorous debates on regimes of knowledge production (Hessels & Van Lente, 2008). While different general models were proposed to describe a transition (see, e. g. “mode 2 production of knowledge”, “post normal science”, “strategic science”, “academic capitalism”), these models often posit a dichotomous history, stating that a new regime simply succeeded the previous one (Rip, 2000). In a nutshell, the old regime characterized by strong public intervention and a linear conception of innovation is replaced by a new regime where research and innovation are conceived in systemic terms, regarding their strategic interest for the economy and their societal relevance. This dichotomous conception of STI policy change has been criticized regarding its historical accuracy, e. g. with Pestre (2003), showing that the autonomy of research that characterizes the old regime, or “mode 1 ” is While the diagnosis of these various science and technology policy studies is not to be dispraised concerning the different effects they emphasize, These macro-perspectives are of little use when it comes to study a local situation they lack acuteness to properly describe and compare empirical observation of such policy changes. This issue is even more salient for empirical work to be conducted in states where multi-level policies are crafted on different, sometimes overlapping national and regional polities. In Belgium, the case in point in my PhD researches, the above-mentioned studies are of little use to characterize the actual state and interplay of Walloon and Flemish STI systems. Hence, {{there is a need to}} develop theoretical approaches paying greater attention to local specificities and nuances. My proposal builds on an analysis of STI policies based on coexisting, and sometimes competing “narratives”. In the vein of Stone (1989) and Radaelli (2000), this paper aims at comparing the different policy narratives that circulates as rationale for STI policies in Wallonia, to identify their variants and to study their interplay. Policy narratives give meaning to complex realities, they help making sense of things, but they also contain a plot; they are articulating elements in a logical sequence (with, e. g., causalities, cf. Stone, 1989). As such, they are resources for action: they are descriptive and prescriptive. The broad literature of innovation studies, and its diffusion through the EU or the OECD already provides the Walloon STI stakeholders with different master-narratives (Sum & Jessop, 2013). So far, I could distinguish four different master-narratives in the literature as well as in Walloon stakeholders ‘discourses: •	“The Knowledge-based economy” (KBE). KBE seems to be the “dominant” master-narrative today. In a nutshell, this narrative runs as follow (see OECD, 1996) : knowledge is the source of economic growth. Since innovation and market success are better encountered through network management and the intertwinement of industry and university, STI institutions must be organized accordingly, in order to achieve a sustained growth and a “better competitiveness” o	Variants of this narrative are, e. g. the triple-helix model (Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 2000), or National innovation system (Freeman, 1987, Lundvall, 1988). •	Grand societal challenges: This recent master-narrative is being promoted by the OECD and the EU (see, e. g., Lund Declaration, 2009). It states that scientific research should benefit of high (public) funding in certain areas, or regarding certain issues. High means for strategic research should help to solve major problems such as climate change, ageing population, energy supply and consumption, cancer, etc. This narrative calls for mission oriented STI policy, so the concern here is not (solely/primarily) economic (Kallerud et al 2013). •	 “Science, the endless frontier” - continued: famously reported by V. Bush (1945), this master-narrative is still of common use among STI stakeholders. With this narrative, science is considered a public good, the state has to fund it because the linear conception of innovation and serendipity assure technological and economic progress in the end – the rationale is based on economic aspects (the state must fund research because it is a special kind of good and the market efficiency will not work, and basic research is the source of marketable innovation). •	“Science for the sake of science”: in this narrative, science is considered as common good regardless of the potential economic impacts (and usefulness to address other societal issues) – we can make a parallel with the idea that artistic creation is worth it: for the beauty, for the critique, science here is considered as a superior activity that brings rationality and knowledge to the society as long as it is independent from “external influences” (Bonneuil & Joly, 2013) – cf. “mertonian Ethos” of Communalism, Universalism, Disinterestedness, Originality and Skepticism. Other examples / variants of this narrative include the idea that science contributes to the greatness of Nation, that science fights obscurantism, and so on and so forth. (examples : peer review, excellence, Copernican revolution are compatible storylines with science for the sake of science : a self-supporting system) While these master-narratives are present in international, academic literature, this paper focuses on their local manifestations. This study compares three critical moments: in different situations, various STI stakeholders (government, researchers, administrative staff, journalists, academic authorities, etc.) publicly expressed their views on the organization and funding of scientific research and innovation activities, and the role of STI within the region. I analyzed the discourses in press articles, policy documents, public statements, allocutions and opinion paper, blogs, etc. I intentionally sampled for heterogeneity since I’m looking for variations and multiple use of narratives. The analysis of the Walloon case permits to overcome the <b>double</b> <b>dichotomy</b> of dominant vs. counter narrative and old vs. new regime. The different narratives, in context, are concurrent but they are not mutually exclusive: while the narratives purport different ideologies, different visions of the role of science and of the state intervention, one is not being erased by the advent of another. Rather, I could find out that narratives “overlap”, and one narrative does not constitute the only resource of a (group of) actors. In situation, the actors use one or multiple narratives, regarding the context, the public, the goal of a policy, etc., in a dynamic of conflict or compromise. This description of the transition is more accurate than the one provided with a sequence of two regimes, since the flexible use of multiple narratives accounts for the continuity of certain institutions (justified by, e. g., a version of “science for the sake of science”) as well as for certain reforms in STI policy (that are inspired by the KBE narrative, for example).
