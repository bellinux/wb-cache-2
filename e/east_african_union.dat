The Tanzanian Railways - except the TAZARA - was reorganised as Tanzania Railways Corporation (TRC). Economically, the network then went constantly downhill, due to increasing road traffic, corruption and political neglect. A number of rail links, such as between Arusha and Moshi, were shut down, and passenger services abandoned, including on the Usambara Railway.|$|E

40|$|Internal {{communication}} {{is a vital}} component of organizational communication and {{plays a major role}} in the realization of an organization’s mission because it influences organization members’ interpersonal relationships. However, most of the literature on organizational communication understates factors that may impede adequate internal communication practices in complex organizations such as <b>East</b> <b>African</b> <b>Union</b> (EAU). Hence factors such as the organization’s culture, or organization members’ cultural and educational backgrounds, and gender relations are understated. Furthermore, the literature understates how complex organizational structures such as those of the EAU can hinder or facilitate effective internal communication or the relationships between communication partners. Also, most studies on organizational communication have tended to study organizations from a problem-centric approach, making them more problematic and complex. This study provides an alternative lens for studying organizations by advocating for a positive approach. The study sought to identify existing positive internal communication practices in EAU, and strategies to improve them. Using structuration theory to frame the research questions and 3 phases of appreciative inquiry (AI) cycle, this study established that trust, leader-follower confidence, freedom of creativity and positive gender relations influence the organization’s internal communication practices. Enhanced communication in turn improves trust, leader-follower confidence, creativity, and positive gender relations. Study participants identified and proposed strategies, actions and practices to enhance the respective communication drivers. The study found that variables such as the organization’s culture, diverse organizational members, organizational leadership, and appreciative inquiry mediate the effect of internal communication in the organization, making the improvement of internal communication in EAU through appreciative inquiry a dynamic, tentative and fluid process. The study showed that structuration theory facilitated organizational learning and change of the organization’s communication culture demonstrating therefore that the organization was open to learning. This study contributes to organizational communication studies by demonstrating that enhanced trust, enhanced leader-follower confidence, enhanced creativity, and positive gender relations influence the quality and quantity of internal communication and vice versa. The study also contributes to appreciative inquiry studies by extending it to Christian organizations and also demonstrates that AI can be used flexibly according to a researcher’s needs...|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{a survey of}} recent advances {{in the literature on}} proposed <b>African</b> monetary <b>unions.</b> The survey comprises about 60 empirical papers published during the past fifteen years. Four main strands are discussed individually and collectively, notably, the proposed: West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ), <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Monetary <b>Union</b> (EAMU), Southern <b>African</b> Monetary <b>Union</b> (SAMU) and <b>African</b> Monetary <b>Union</b> (AMU). We observe a number of issues with establishing the feasibility and/or desirability of potential monetary unions, inter alia, variations in: choice of variables, empirical strategies, sampled countries and considered periodicities. We address this ambiguity by reviewing studies with scenarios that are consistent with Hegelian dialectics and establish selective expansion as the predominant mode of monetary integration. Some proponents make cases for strong pegs and institutions as viable alternatives to currency unions. Using cluster analysis, disaggregating panels into sub-samples and distinguishing shocks from responses in the examination of business cycle synchronisation provide more subtle policy implications. We caution that for inquiries using the same theoretical underpinnings, variables and methods just by modifying the scope/context and periodicity may only contribute to increasing the number of conflicting findings. Authors should place more emphasis on new perspectives and approaches based on caveats of, and lessons from the European Monetary Union (EMU) and CFA zones...|$|R

The <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Community (Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda) has a goal of a {{currency}} union, {{as part of a}} movement toward eventual political union. A key factor in making a currency union desirable is a high level of business cycle synchronization (BCS) among member countries. In this paper we undertake a new approach to this topic with a recently developed set of tools. These tools have the advantage of yielding time-varying estimates, and, unlike previous metrics, allow us to gauge both differences of the phase of the business cycle between countries and differences in business cycle amplitude. We find BCS among the five countries does compare reasonable well with that found for euro zone nations before euro adoption. However, given the euros' difficulties, this is not strong evidence in favor of the desirability of a currency union. Moreover, Rwanda appears less well-suited, in terms of BCS, than the other four countries. In addition, all five nations have experienced sharp drops in BCS in recent years. Lastly, there has been no significant increase in BCS since the 2000 EAC Treaty, or the 2005 customs union.

40|$|For {{the most}} part, formal {{economic}} integration between African states can be characterised as ‘theatre regionalism’: governments sign regional economic agreements with no intention to implement them. Yet amidst widespread theatre {{there have been}} a few instances of actual integration. This thesis sets out to explain this variance: under what conditions do African governments implement – and not just sign – formal agreements on regional economic integration? To answer this question the dominant Eurocentric literature on comparative regionalism is amended with insights from the third worldist literature on African states to develop a new approach for comparative analysis, the ‘Regionalism as Policy Space’ (RPS) framework. This framework models African regionalism as a two-stage game. At the first stage, governments’ interests in regionalism are determined by perceptions of the existence of structural cross-issue linkages connecting implementation of regional agreements with the widening of government policy space. Given such linkages, at the second stage, governments of a region engage in a coordination game to establish the distribution of benefits from integration. Variance in the implementation of regional agreements, then, is explained by variance in the existence of perceived cross-issue linkages (the Benefits Existence Condition) and the ability of participating governments to ease distributional tensions (the Benefits Distribution Condition).

40|$|The {{treaty of}} 1999 {{to revive the}} defunct <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Community (EAC) {{ratified}} by Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania came into force on July 2000 {{with the objective of}} fostering a closer co-operation in political, economic, social, and cultural fields. To achieve this, an East Africa Customs Union protocol was signed in March 2004. A Common Market, a Monetary Union, and ultimately a Political Federation of East Africa states is planned. Though the question of a monetary union has been discussed in the political arena there has been no corresponding empirical study on the economic viability of such a union. This article fills the gap and assesses whether the political force driving the EAC towards a monetary union has economic basis. In particular, we focus on the symmetry of the underlying shocks across the <b>East</b> <b>African</b> economies as a precondition for forming an optimum currency area (OCA). As Mundell (1961) and McKinnon (1963) describe, the member countries of a monetary union do not have independent monetary policy, which differs from that of the union as a whole; governments cannot use monetary and exchange rate policies to react to a country-specific shock. How serious this limitation is for the union countries depends on the degree of asymmetry of shocks and the speed with which the economies adjust to these shocks. If disturbances are distributed symmetrically across union countries, a common response will suffice. If, however, the countries face mostly asymmetric shocks, the retention of policy autonomy is beneficial. <b>East</b> <b>African,</b> Monetary <b>Union,</b> Optimal Currency Area, Structural Vector Autoregression Analysis...|$|R

Currently the intention is to sign the <b>East</b> <b>African</b> Monetary <b>Union</b> protocol 2012, while the date for actual implementation of the common currency is uncertain. The purpose of this note is to discuss preconditions for an effective monetary union among the EAC members, with a focus on Rwanda.

It concludes that although there are potentially substantive economic net-benefits, a monetary union is a risky project for political reasons. The political will among policymakers is key to successful implementation, and it could vanish with a change of government or because of discontent among influential lobby groups. However, the process towards forming are monetary union is appears to be highly beneficial the EAC members, both directly by improving monetary policy and indirectly by contributing to economic integration.

Without correctly modelling MTR, it is impossible either to obtain accurate estimates of the effects on trade of exchange rate regimes and other variables or to perform accurate counterfactual simulations of trade patterns under other assumptions about exchange rate regimes or other variables. In this paper we implement a number of different ways of modelling MTR – both for a standard gravity model and for an extended model which includes a full range of bilateral exchange rate regimes – notably several variants of the technique developed by Baier and Bergstrand (2006), which turn out to produce broadly similar results.
