The competing YC-15 had started flights {{almost a year}} earlier. Head-to-head flight testing at Edwards Air Force Base started in early November 1976. During flight testing, the YC-14 was flown at speeds as low as 59 kn and as high as M=.78 at 38000 ft. However, {{it was found that}} the YC-14's drag was 11% higher than originally predicted. Modifications developed in wind tunnel testing, comprising the addition of vortex generators to the upper aft portion of the nacelles, deletion of the nozzle door actuator fairing, alterations to the aft end of the landing gear pods and the addition of aft fuselage strakes, reduced this drag <b>decrement</b> <b>to</b> 7%.

40|$|In PC Cl 3 cells, a continuous, fully {{differentiated}} rat thyroid cell line, P 2 Y 2 purinoceptor activation {{provoked a}} transient increase of [Ca 2 C] i, {{followed by a}} decreasing sustained phase. The a and b 1 protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Gö 6976 decreased the rate of <b>decrement</b> <b>to</b> the basal [Ca 2 C]i level and increased the peak of Ca 2 C entry of the P 2 Y 2 -provoked Ca 2 C transients. These effects of Gö 6976 were not caused by an increased permeability of the plasma membrane, since the Mn 2 C and Ba 2 C uptake were not changed by Gö 6976. Similarly, the Na C /Ca 2 C exchanger was not implicated, since the rate of <b>decrement</b> <b>to</b> the basal [Ca 2 C] i level was equally decreased in physiological and Na C-free buffers, {{in the presence of}} Gö 6976. On the contrary, the activity of the sarcoplasmic–endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 C ATPase (SERCA) 2 b was profoundly affected by Gö 6976 since the drug was able to completely inhibit the stimulation of the SERCA 2 b activity elicited by P 2 -purinergic agonists. Finally, the PKC activator phorbol myristate acetate had effects opposite to Gö 6976, in that it markedly increased the rate of <b>decrement</b> <b>to</b> the basal [Ca 2 C] i level after P 2 Y 2 stimulation and also increased the activity of SERCA 2 b.

If the channel {{is found to}} be idle for an interval that exceeds the distributed inter frame space (DIFS), the node continues its transmission.

After the medium becomes idle for a DIFS period, nodes decrement their backoff timer until the channel becomes busy again or the timer reaches zero. If the timer has not reached zero and the medium becomes busy, the node freezes its timer. When the timer is finally decremented to zero, the node transmits its packet.
