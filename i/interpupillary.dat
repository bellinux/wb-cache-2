50|$|The {{distance}} between the inner corner of the left eye and the inner corner of the right eye, is called intercanthal distance. In most people, the intercanthal distance {{is equal to the}} {{distance between}} the inner corner and the outer corner of each eye, that is, the width of the eye. The average <b>interpupillary</b> distance is 60-62 millimeters (mm), which corresponds to an intercanthal distance of approximately 30-31 mm. The situation, where intercanthal distance is intensely bigger than the width of the eye, is called telecanthus (tele= Greek τηλε = far, and Greek ακανθα = thorn).

50|$|Human {{eyes are}} {{horizontally}} separated by about 50-75 mm (<b>interpupillary</b> distance) depending on each individual.

The binocular disparity can be observed from apparent horizontal shift of the vertical edge between both views.|$|E
50|$|Surgeons in many {{specialties}} commonly use loupes {{when doing}} surgery on delicate structures. The loupes used by surgeons are {{mounted in the}} lenses of glasses and are custom made for the individual surgeon, taking into account their corrected vision, <b>interpupillary</b> distance and desired focal distance. Multiple magnification powers are available. They are most commonly used in otolaryngology, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery, and vascular surgery.|$|E
50|$|Pupillary {{distance}} (PD) or <b>interpupillary</b> distance (IPD) is {{the distance}} (the industry standard is to measure in millimeters) between {{the centers of}} the pupils in each eye. This measurement is used when preparing to make prescription eyeglasses. Positioning lenses correctly {{in relation to the}} centre of the pupils is especially important for higher powered lenses due to the location of the optical centre of the lenses. It can also be relevant to binoculars: they must be adjusted to suit the user's IPD; and the minimum allowed by some binoculars is still too great for people with a small IPD.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Interpupillary</b> {{distance}} (IPD) is {{the distance}} between the center of the pupils of the two eyes. IPD is critical for the design of binocular viewing systems, where both eye pupils need to be positioned within the exit pupils of the viewing system. These viewing systems include binocular microscopes, night vision devices or goggles (NVGs), and head-mounted displays (HMDs). IPD data are used in the design of such systems to specify the range of lateral adjustment of the exit optics or eyepieces. IPD is also used to describe {{the distance between}} the exit pupils or optical axes of a binocular optical system.|$|E
50|$|Another {{indispensable}} {{piece of}} equipment is a pupilometer. A pupilometer is a tool for more accurately measuring <b>interpupillary</b> distance (IPD or PD). It is used for fitting eyeglasses so that the lenses are centered in the visual axis. This {{is the most common}} nomenclature. A pupilometer may be manually operated, or may be digital. Pupilometers may also be used to verify a PD measurement taken by hand with a millimeter ruler. A pupilometer is best suited for better assurance in fitting progressive lenses, and other specialty lenses, since even tiny errors cause eye strain. Pupilometer apps have also been developed for smart phones and tablets.|$|E
5000|$|Ability to show {{stereoscopic}} imagery. A binocular HMD has {{the potential}} to display a different image to each eye. This can be used to show stereoscopic images. It should be borne in mind that so-called 'Optical Infinity' is generally taken by flight surgeons and display experts as about 9 metres. This is the distance at which, given the average human eye rangefinder [...] "baseline" [...] (distance between the eyes or <b>Interpupillary</b> distance (IPD)) of between 2.5 and 3 inches (6 and 8 cm), the angle of an object at that distance becomes essentially the same from each eye. At smaller ranges the perspective from each eye is significantly different and the expense of generating two different visual channels through the computer-generated imagery (CGI) system becomes worthwhile.|$|E
50|$|Pupillary Distance (PD) is the {{distance}} between pupil centers, usually expressed in millimeters. It is sometimes known as the <b>interpupillary</b> Distance (IPD). It is written as two values if the prescription is for bifocals or progressive lenses - these are the pupillary distances for {{the distance}} and near fixation (essentially, {{the upper and lower}} part of the lenses). They differ due to pupillary convergence when looking at near objects. Additionally, an eyeglasses prescription may include a monocular pupillary distance ("monocular PD"). These measurements indicate, in millimeters, the distances from the center of each pupil {{to the center of the}} nose where the center of the frame bridge rests. PD measurements are essential for all spectacle dispensings, monocular PDs being essential in progressive lenses and for those with high prescription. PDs can be measured using a pupilometer or by using a ruler. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, PD measurement is not a legal requirement as part of the prescription and is often not included.|$|E
50|$|The Oculus Rift headset uses an OLED {{panel for}} each eye, each having a {{resolution}} of 1080×1200. These panels have a refresh rate of 90 Hz and globally refresh, rather than scanning out in lines. They also use low persistence, meaning that they only display an image for 2 milliseconds of each frame. This combination of the high refresh rate, global refresh and low persistence means that the user experiences none of the motion blurring or judder that is experienced on a regular monitor. It uses lenses that allow for a wide field of view. The separation of the lenses is adjustable by a dial {{on the bottom of}} the device, in order to accommodate a wide range of <b>interpupillary</b> distances. The same pair of lenses are used for all users, however there are multiple facial interfaces so that the user's eyes can be positioned at a different distance.

Aim: To evaluate the relationship between extraoral and intraoral soft tissue landmarks with the occlusal plane in dentulous subjects on both sides and to check for any variations. Study and Design: An in vivo study and 100 subjects with all healthy permanent teeth in normal arch and alignment were selected from Modern Dental College and Research Centre, Indore. Materials and Methods: Three custom made instruments (occlusal plane analyzer, buccinator groove relator, and level analyzer) were indigenously designed to check parallelism of the <b>interpupillary</b> line, ala-tragus line, buccinator groove with the occlusal plane. Relation of retromolar pad with the occlusal plane was checked with the metallic scale. Statistical Analysis: Chi-square test. Results: In 20. 0 % subjects, the occlusal plane was parallel to the <b>interpupillary</b> line. The posterior reference point for ala-tragus line was middle point on right side in 56 % and left side in 58 % subjects.

Methods: <b>Interpupillary</b> distance (IPD) by Viktorin&# 39;s method and the corneal reflex pupillometer (PD- 5) method, as well as near heterophoria by the Saladin near point card, were each obtained on 133 randomly selected normal subjects aged 20 – 67 years. Comparison within and between techniques, influence of age on IPD, and near heterophoria were assessed. Results: The mean FIPD varied significantly from the NIPD (P 0. 05) for FIPD, and - 3. 1 mm and 2. 9 mm (P > 0. 05) for NIPD. Both IPDs varied significantly across age groups (P 0. 04; P < 0. 03, both techniques). Conclusion: The difference between FIPD and NIPD (about 4. 4 mm in Arab males) was observed independent of the technique used. The Viktorin&# 39;s and the PD- 5 methods of IPD assessment resulted in similar values, and therefore, could be interchangeably used. However, caution is advised in cases of high power refractive corrections as the difference could vary from - 4 mm to + 3 mm (FIPD) and - 3 mm to + 3 mm (NIPD).

40|$|We have {{hypothesized}} {{that the size of}} the binocular field among mammals has been selected to maximize the visually surveyable region around the animal (Changizi and Shimojo, 2008). At first glance it may seem that this hypothesis should always predict lateral pointing eyes, and a consequently small binocular field width. However, the hypothesis does not predict lateral pointing eyes in cases where the environment is filled with leafy occlusions and the animal's <b>interpupillary</b> distance surpasses the typical widths of the leaves (when both of these apply, we call the environment “cluttered”). In such cases, within an animal's binocular region the eyes tend to sample the scene independently. Laterally directed eyes also sample the scene independently, but the binocular region benefits from a variety of binocular summation, lowering the threshold for the recognition of objects in the binocular field. Our hypothesis predicts that mammals outside of leafy environments should have small binocular fields, independent {{of the size of the}} animal; but it predicts that for animals in leafy environments, whereas small animals should have small binocular fields (because their <b>interpupillary</b> distance is small compared to the typical occlusion width), large animals should have large binocular fields (because the binocular region begins to become more powerful at object recognition).
