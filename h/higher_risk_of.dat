40|$|Objective To screen {{vascular}} {{risk factors}} for cognitive dysfunction in population with <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> stroke by cognitive function evaluation on community people with <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> stroke. Methods A total of 541 subjects who were screened with <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> stroke from August to December 2012 in Yanta District of Xi'an, Shaanxi were evaluated by collecting baseline data and analyzing vascular risk factors. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) {{was used to assess}} their cognitive function. Univariate and stepwise multivariate Logistic regression analysis were used to screen vascular {{risk factors for}} cognitive dysfunction in people with <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> stroke. Results In those subjects, 90 people were identified as cognitive dysfunction, with a prevalence of 16. 64 %. Univariate and stepwise multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that diabetes mellitus (OR = 1. 871, 95 % CI: 1. 132 - 3. 151; P = 0. 015) was an independent risk factor for cognitive dysfunction in people with <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> stroke. Conclusions Vascular risk factors could increase the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> cognitive dysfunction, especially diabetes mellitus is the independent risk factor for cognitive dysfunction in people with <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> stroke.   DOI: 10. 3969 /j. issn. 1672 - 6731. 2017. 02. 010 </table...|$|R

5|$|Following work by {{the breed}} clubs to ensure that any reoccurring health {{problems}} are dealt with, there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. However, minor problems affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in the breed, the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals throughout their lives. The Dandie is also at slightly <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> canine cancer than average. The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 1113 years.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to breast cancer}} in men and women, mutations in BRCA2 also lead to {{an increased risk of}} ovarian, Fallopian tube, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, as well as malignant melanoma. In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} of early-stage NSCLC, {{removal of a}} lobe of lung (lobectomy) is the {{surgical}} treatment of choice. In people who are unfit for a full lobectomy, a smaller sublobar excision (wedge resection) may be performed. However, wedge resection has a <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> recurrence than lobectomy. Radioactive iodine brachytherapy {{at the margins of}} wedge excision may reduce the risk of recurrence. Rarely, removal of a whole lung (pneumonectomy) is performed. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and VATS lobectomy use a minimally invasive approach to lung cancer surgery. VATS lobectomy is equally effective compared to conventional open lobectomy, with less postoperative illness.|$|E

Levels of 7g per day or more in people with hypertension were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, {{but this was not}} found to be true for people without hypertension.

After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E
5|$|Some sexually {{transmitted}} diseases are communicable between women, including human papillomavirus (HPV)—specifically genital warts—squamous intraepithelial lesions, trichomoniasis, syphilis, and herpes simplex virus (HSV). Transmission of specific {{sexually transmitted}} diseases among women {{who have sex with}} women depends on the sexual practices women engage in. Any object that comes in contact with cervical secretions, vaginal mucosa, or menstrual blood, including fingers or penetrative objects may transmit {{sexually transmitted diseases}}. Orogenital contact may indicate a <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> acquiring HSV, even among women who have had no prior sex with men.|$|E
5|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans.

Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|E

5|$|The {{increased}} radiation levels pose a <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> crews developing cancer, and {{can cause}} damage to the chromosomes of lymphocytes. These cells {{are central to the}} immune system and so any damage to them could contribute to the lowered immunity experienced by cosmonauts. Over time, lowered immunity results in the spread of infection between crew members, especially in such confined areas. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of cataracts in cosmonauts. Protective shielding and protective drugs may lower the risks to an acceptable level, but data is scarce and longer-term exposure will result in greater risks.|$|E
5|$|There is also modest {{evidence}} that genetic factors influence the prognosis in SAH.

While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E
