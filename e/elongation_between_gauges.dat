40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to the study of various types of equivalences in large N gauge theories. We are {{specifically}} interested in theories whose dynamics is not constrained by supersymmetry or conformal invariance, and we consider theories both at zero and at finite temperature. Specific examples include equivalences <b>between</b> <b>gauge</b> theories, gauge theories and matrix models, and <b>between</b> <b>gauge</b> theories and gravitational theories. The use of lattice regularization for zero temperature gauge theories and effective hydrodynamic description for finite temperature gauge theories made it possible to find generic equivalences which do not rely on any sort of small-parameter expansion...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, a {{tremendous}} amount of {{progress has been made in}} understanding gauge theories and theories of gravity, especially string theory. One extremely profound result of this new understanding is a connection <b>between</b> <b>gauge</b> theories, which a priori seem to have nothing to do with gravity, and M-Theory, which, in its many facets, is the candidate for a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity. A key role in the “duality” <b>between</b> <b>gauge</b> theories and M-Theory is played by the UV- IR connection: short scales in one theory are exchanged with long scales in the dual theory...|$|R

40|$|The alpha-amanitin domain or domain f of {{the largest}} subunit of RNA {{polymerase}}s {{is one of the}} most conserved of these enzymes. We have found that the C-terminal part of domain f can be swapped between yeast RNA polymerase II and III. An extensive mutagenesis of domain f of C 160, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase III, was carried out to better define its role and understand the mechanism through which C 160 participates in transcription. One mutant enzyme, C 160 - 270, showed much reduced transcription of a non-specific template at low DNA concentrations. Abortive synthesis of trinucleotides in a dinucleotide-primed reaction proceeded at roughly wild-type levels, indicating that the mutation did not affect the formation of the first phosphodiester bond, but rather the transition from abortive initiation to processive elongation. In specific transcription assays, on the SUP 4 tRNA gene, pausing was extended but the rate of RNA <b>elongation</b> <b>between</b> pause sites was not affected. Finally, the rate of cleavage of nascent RNA transcripts by halted mutant RNA polymerase was increased approximately 10 -fold. We propose that the domain f mutation affects the transition between two transcriptional modes, one being adopted during abortive transcription and at pause sites, the other during <b>elongation</b> <b>between</b> pause sites...|$|R
