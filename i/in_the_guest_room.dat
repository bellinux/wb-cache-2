25|$|A 16-year-old American boy {{calling himself}} Billy {{approaches}} Ripley in the village, {{asking for a}} job. Ripley agrees {{to give him a}} small amount of gardening work and puts him up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>room,</b> but he believes that he recognizes the youth from a newspaper. Further investigation reveals that 'Billy' is actually Frank Pierson, the son of a recently deceased American tycoon, who has fled the United States.|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>room,</b> Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
500|$|... "The Final Hours", {{the third}} episode of Son of God, details Jesus's last days alive. Bowen {{claims that the}} Last Supper would have been held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> of a [...] "well-to-do" [...] house in Jerusalem. Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper {{took place in a}} triclinium. As guest of honour, Jesus would have been {{at the end of the}} table with John the Apostle at his side, rather than at the centre, as {{proposed}} by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus could have sweated blood at Gethsemane. Leaving the Middle East for the first time, he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe, a forensic pathologist at Columbia University. Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis, a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die. He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences. Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County, Vermont, by measuring their blood pressure while they are strapped to crosses with their arms outstretched and level with their shoulders. He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus's crucifixion, with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists, may have been possible if his feet were supported. The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of Jehohanan, a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion, also supports this theory. Next, Bowen questions whether the disciple Judas Iscariot truly did double-cross Jesus. William Klassen, an historian at École Biblique in Jerusalem, theorises that the Greek word [...] "paradidomi" [...] was mistranslated, and that Judas simply [...] "handed over" [...] Jesus to the Romans, rather than betrayed him.|$|E

The Culver Hotel also hosts live jazz and special events.|$|R
60|$|There is a {{touch of}} pathos in this parting {{acquiescence}} in fate. If it must be so, indeed! I wonder did mine host suspect that I did not all leave,--that a part of me, a sort of ghostly lodger, remained with him who had asked me so little for my stay? Probably in body I shall never stir him again from beside his fire, nor follow as he leads {{the way through the}} labyrinth of his house; but in spirit, at times, I still steal back, and I always find the same kind welcome awaiting me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>room</b> in the ell, and the same bright smile of morning to gild the tiny garden court. The only things beyond the grasp of change are our own memories of what once was.|$|E

50|$|The resort {{consists}} of ten individual buildings, divided into five pairs. Each building is three stories tall and the rooms all {{open to the}} exterior hallways. The buildings have exterior and interior decor to match their names.

50|$|The Bear Creek Motel is a {{historic}} motel on United States Route 65 in Bear Creek Springs, Arkansas. It is a single T-shaped stone and concrete building, built in 1936 to replace a wood-framed tourist accommodation that had burned down. The building has a distinctive wave-shaped concrete roof, intended to lure travelers off the road, and houses five <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> and an office. The wave shape is continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>rooms,</b> which have barrel-vaulted ceilings, and are also finished in concrete and stone veneer.|$|R
50|$|The Hotel {{featured}} a wrap around porch {{that provided a}} picturesque view of Blanket Mountain, that was wide enough for numerous swings and white rocking chairs (green in later years) where visitors relaxed. Because the Wonderland provided no phones, radios or TV <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>rooms,</b> most visitors choose to spend their evenings relaxing either on <b>the</b> porch or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lobby, meeting and getting to know <b>the</b> other <b>guests.</b> It was a common sight to have Raccoons come up on the porch at night to beg for food from <b>the</b> <b>guests.</b>|$|R

50|$|There are {{no known}} {{original}} {{drawings of the}} interior, so HRI had a task on their hands. They had to go in, and document {{every aspect of the}} building, including measurements of floor to ceiling heights and mechanical equipment to name just a few. Original plaster ceilings found hidden behind suspended ceilings were discovered. Finally interior demolition began, gutting the interior down to the floor plates, stairwells, and elevator shafts. This included removal of escalators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lobby, tearing out and replacing all electrical and plumbing. <b>The</b> window frames <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> were made of cypress and were restored with broken glass replaced.|$|R
50|$|The {{hotel lobby}} {{remains the most}} intact {{interior}} space within the building. The Patio Room, once {{the hallmark of the}} hotel, has been covered over, modernized and combined with the Empire Room. Originally, the open patio room was framed by a Corinthian arcade. A small formal garden and fountain room, the Spartan Room on the second floor has also been modernized. Ceilings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lobby, Spartan and Empire rooms were hand-painted, but alterations over the years have obliterated the original work. Wood details <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> and <b>the</b> ornate hand-carved wood doors leading to the retail areas are intact. Many of the rooms have original bathroom fixtures.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the athletes}} hotels is <b>the</b> APA Hotel <b>in</b> Sapporo. <b>The</b> founder and {{president}} of this hotel chain, Toshio Motoya, who is a strong supporter of political and historical view aligned with those of Japan's right wing. For example, Motoya claimed that [...] "Japanese aggression, the Nanking Massacre, and comfort women" [...] were [...] "fabricated stories" [...] or [...] "fictitious". His book is available <b>in</b> each of <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> at <b>the</b> hotel. This created controversy, particularly in China, which caused the games organizers to ask the hotel to take appropriate actions and remove them from <b>guest</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>The</b> Organizing Committee will gain exclusive access over the hotel from February 12, and an organization committee official said, [...] "we can decide what is removed and placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> so that we don’t place any items that offend athletes, from not only China, but also any other nation”. Eventually both South Korea and China requested that their athletes stay at a different hotel, and the organizing committee obliged by changing their accommodations to the Sapporo Prince Hotel.|$|R

The maintenance demand of the daytime electrical work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> <b>rooms</b> was found to dominate over those of the air-conditioning, plumbing and drainage, and builder's works. The performances of the four trades of work, although exhibiting strong correlations with their demands, were not correlated with their manpower inputs.
