5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E

5|$|Shoe polish {{products}} are low-value {{items that are}} infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months {{for even the most}} frequent user. Consumer demand is inelastic and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with sneakers <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> use.|$|E
5|$|The SS {{established}} its own symbolism, rituals, customs, {{ranks and}} uniforms to set itself {{apart from other}} organizations. Before 1929, the SS wore the same brown uniform as the SA, {{with the addition of}} a black tie and a black cap with a Totenkopf (death's head) skull and bones symbol, moving to an all-black uniform in 1932. In 1935, the SS combat formations adopted a service uniform in field grey <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> wear. The SS also developed its own field uniforms, which included reversible smocks and helmet covers printed with camouflage patterns. Uniforms were manufactured in hundreds of licensed factories, with some workers being prisoners of war performing forced labor. Many were produced in concentration camps.|$|E
5|$|These {{were the}} major stamp {{productions}} <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> use.

Some definitive and commemorative stamps have been produced in miniature sheet, booklet and coil configurations {{in addition to the}} common sheet layout. Postage dues and airmails complete the stamp issues of the two, sequential, Irish stamp-issuing authorities. Two styles of watermark were used though the overprinted issues came with the watermarks of the British stamps provided for overprinting by the British Post Office.|$|E

5|$|In the 4th century, Coptic script—based on the Greek {{alphabet}} {{with additional}} characters from Egyptian demotic to reflect Egyptian phonology—is found in documents in several dialects, including Old Bohairic, Fayumic, Achmimic, and Sahidic. At this time Coptic {{emerged as a}} fully literary language, including major translations of Greek scriptures, liturgical texts, and patristic works. From the 4th to 7th centuries, original works—including homilies, saints' lives, monastic rules, letters, and exhortations—were composed in Coptic, primarily in the Sahidic dialect. As a writing system, Coptic was used <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> purposes such as inventories and real estate transactions, {{as well as for}} poetry. By the 640s, when Egypt came under Arab rule, Coptic-speaking Christians constituted the majority of the population. At the end of the 7th century, legal texts might still be written in Coptic: in one example, a bilingual Greek-Arabic protocol with a reference to Mohammed precedes a document entirely in Coptic that invokes the Trinity.|$|E
