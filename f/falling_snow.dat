5|$|Snow {{interacts with}} {{vegetation}} in two principal ways, vegetation {{can influence the}} deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept <b>falling</b> <b>snow</b> and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth {{is dependent on the}} departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|One {{challenge}} for the production team was how to convey Bella's depression once Edward departs. In the novel, these pages were filled {{with the names of}} the passing months, and in the movie, would be represented as a visual effects shot with a camera circling around Kristen Stewart. The window that was used for the original film did not quite fit what Weitz was looking for, so the production team created a bay window when recreating the Swan house. The effect was one of the 300 visual effects helmed by Prime Focus led by visual effects supervisor Eric Pascarelli. It required matching two camera shots: one that shot the actress in a chair, and the other shooting the view outside the window as seen from the house built on location. Using a greenscreen, Prime Focus was able to enhance the changing of seasons with computer-generated leaves and <b>falling</b> <b>snow.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{enter the}} ride, guests {{walk through the}} gates of Hogwarts and begin their journey in the dungeons where they see items {{featured}} in the movies and books. Passengers enter through the castle doors, go to the lockers, queue outside in the green house and then enter the back castle doors. Objects recognizable from the series include the Mirror of Erised, the Hogwarts House Jewels, and talking portraits. As guests proceed throughout the hallways, they encounter replicas of the rooms of Hogwarts castle, including the Headmaster's office, the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom and the Gryffindor common room. In the Headmaster's office, Professor Dumbledore extends a warm welcome to all Muggles, informing them that Professor Binns is hosting a lecture {{on the history of}} the school. In the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom, Harry, Ron, and Hermione appear from under the Invisibility Cloak, urging guests to meet them in the Room of Requirement in order to sneak everyone down to a Quidditch match. Ron tries to cast a spell, which goes wrong, and one of several special effects, such as <b>falling</b> <b>snow,</b> is triggered. Before continuing on, visitors receive a safety reminder from the Sorting Hat and several paintings in the next two rooms.|$|E

However, there was little change to the plot itself, and the dialogue remained entirely with the six onstage characters and one offstage character.|$|E
25|$|The weak {{absorption}} of radio waves by the medium through which it passes is what enables radar sets to detect objects at relatively long ranges—ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths, such as visible light, infrared light, and ultraviolet light, are too strongly attenuated. Such weather phenomena as fog, clouds, rain, <b>falling</b> <b>snow,</b> and sleet that block visible light are usually transparent to radio waves. Certain radio frequencies that are absorbed or scattered by water vapour, raindrops, or atmospheric gases (especially oxygen) are avoided in designing radars, except when their detection is intended.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background In the UK, the 2009 / 10 {{winter was}} characterised by {{sustained}} low temperatures; grit stocks became depleted and surfaces left untreated. We describe {{the relationship between}} temperature and emergency hospital admissions for <b>falls</b> on <b>snow</b> and ice in England, identify the age and gender of those {{most likely to be}} admitted, and estimate the inpatient costs of these admissions during the 2009 / 10 winter. Methods Hospital Episode Statistics were used to identify episodes of emergency admissions for <b>falls</b> on <b>snow</b> and ice during winters 2005 / 06 to 2009 / 10; these were plotted against mean winter temperature. By region, the logs of the rates of weekly emergency admissions for <b>falls</b> on <b>snow</b> and ice were plotted against the mean weekly temperature for winters 2005 / 06 to 2009 / 10 and a linear regression analysis undertaken. For the 2009 / 10 winter the number of emergency hospital admissions for <b>falls</b> on <b>snow</b> and ice were plotted by age and gender. The inpatient costs of admissions in the 2009 / 10 winter for <b>falls</b> on <b>snow</b> and ice were calculated using Healthcare Resource Group costs and Admitted Patient Care 2009 / 10 National Tariff Information. Results The number of emergency hospital admissions due to <b>falls</b> on <b>snow</b> and ice varied considerably across years; the number was 18 times greater in 2009 / 10 (N = 16, 064) than in 2007 / 08 (N = 890). There is an exponential increase [Ln(rate of admissions) = 0. 456 - 0. 463 *(mean weekly temperature) ] in the rate of emergency hospital admissions for <b>falls</b> on <b>snow</b> and ice as temperature falls. The rate of admissions in 2009 / 10 was highest among the elderly and particularly men aged 80 and over. The total inpatient cost of <b>falls</b> on <b>snow</b> and ice in the 2009 / 10 winter was 42 million GBP. Conclusions Emergency hospital admissions for <b>falls</b> on <b>snow</b> and ice vary greatly across winters, and according to temperature, age and gender. The cost of these admissions in England in 2009 / 10 was considerable. With responsibility for health improvement moving to local councils, they will have to balance the cost of public health measures like gritting with the healthcare costs associated with falls. The economic burden of <b>falls</b> on <b>snow</b> and ice is substantial; keeping surfaces clear of snow and ice is a public health priority. </p...|$|R

500|$|Snow flurry, snow {{storm and}} {{blizzard}} describe snow events of progressively greater duration and intensity. A blizzard is a weather condition involving snow and has varying definitions {{in different parts}} of the world. In the United States, a blizzard occurs when two conditions are met for a period of three hours or more: A sustained wind or frequent gusts to , and sufficient snow in the air to reduce visibility to less than [...] In Canada and the United Kingdom, the criteria are similar. While heavy snowfall often occurs during blizzard conditions, <b>falling</b> <b>snow</b> is not a requirement, as blowing snow can create a ground blizzard.|$|E

For exterior scenes shot during sunnier filming days, computer-generated imagery (CGI) was used to re-create the overcast skies and counter any inconsistencies caused by the <b>falling</b> <b>snow.</b> In depicting the shootout in Lou's home, Kivilo's intent was to [...] "keep things quite sketchy in the lighting and not be clear about exactly what was happening." [...] The camera department lit a China ball from the ceiling to depict a dimly lit kitchen light that would reveal Nancy holding a shotgun. Flash photography guns were used to depict the muzzle flashes during the shootouts.|$|E

500|$|During the {{development}} process, LucasArts supplied {{most of the}} art and level-design, while Factor 5 provided the programming, tools, sound, {{and most of the}} cut-scene and art post-production work. After contemplating the idea of reusing Rogue Squadron game engine, the team decided it was necessary to develop a new engine from scratch. Being more familiar with the Nintendo 64, Factor 5 was able to write Battle for Naboo microcode by identifying the previous engine's strengths and weaknesses. Factor 5 stated that many of Battle for Naboo technical aspects (such as a farther draw distance) [...] "simply would not have been possible" [...] using the Rogue Squadron engine. The game uses a particle system that was written in microcode for the Nintendo 64's Reality Signal Processor. The team first developed the technique to display <b>falling</b> <b>snow</b> in Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, another Nintendo 64 game that was developed simultaneously by the company. The result allowed Battle for Naboo to have rain and the snow effects that display up to 3,000particles at any given time without compromising the game's frame rate and without using the system's central processing unit. Explosions and fountains also use these particle effects.|$|E
500|$|Climax Studios {{began with}} the game's plot, which the {{development}} team considered the main appeal of the series. Early in the game's development, some team members visited a psychiatrist for research. The use of ice as a visual theme originated partly because the developers wanted to create an Otherworld for the game, as previous games in the series had featured the same theme as Silent Hill, and because snowfall is common in the northeastern or midwestern United States, where the fictional town is located. <b>Falling</b> <b>snow</b> was added to limit the player's visibility and build an atmosphere of dread. The developers included a system of psychological profiling that adjusted gameplay elements based on the player's interaction with the game. Writer Sam Barlow explained the system: [...] "ultimately every little thing {{you do in the}} game or piece of content you can interact with can be assigned a little personality score. This is all added into a very classical psychometric profile of your personality that can then be mapped onto research." [...] The opening questionnaire has little significance in the player's profile. Capturing the multiple variations of gameplay elements for submission to the Entertainment Software Rating Board proved to be difficult, according to the game's producer, Tomm Hulett. Loading times were eliminated from the game to maintain a sense of immersion for the player.|$|E
