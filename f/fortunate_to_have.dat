5|$|The Dominicans, who {{introduced}} the first printing {{press in the}} Philippines, were <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been able to transfer the UST printing press from Intramuros to the España campus {{in the nick of}} time in 1940, a year before the Pearl Harbor bombing.|$|E
5|$|Despite his father's {{wishes that}} DeLee become a rabbi, DeLee {{attended}} Chicago Medical College. Of particular influence on DeLee was obstetrics professor W. W. Jaggard. He graduated in 1891. Author Charlotte Borst noted {{that most women}} delivered {{at home in the}} 1870s through 1890s; medical students at Northwestern only witnessed deliveries at that time if they could bribe women into having their babies at the hospital's amphitheatre. DeLee felt <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> observed two such births while he was a student.|$|E
5|$|Indonesian {{artillery}} fire continued to rain {{down on the}} camp, wounding several men and sending the defenders into disarray. Sergeant-Major Williams rushed to the headquarters to order the artillery officer to bombard the taken positions before attempting to organise a counterattack himself. Whilst under heavy Indonesian fire, Williams gathered a section of defenders who had taken refuge in a slit trench and led them towards the captured outer positions. A shell landed among the group and wounded half of them, but Williams and the remainder engaged at least thirty Indonesian infantry who had been firing into the base from the trench in vicious hand-to-hand combat and managed to push them from it with minor casualties. Williams them looked to secure the perimeter, but seeing that the Indonesians were massing for a second attack, {{he sat down in}} a vacated machine gun nest and sprayed the new wave of attackers, who attempted to seize the command bunker, with fire. This was not without cost, and Williams was <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> escaped with a single head wound, which nevertheless blinded him in one eye, though he did not notice this in the heat of battle. Williams then began to receive supporting rifle fire from other British troops in nearby trenches, as well bombardment from the single remaining mortar and some 105mm artillery emplacements from a nearby camp.|$|E

5|$|Willaumez {{had planned}} to {{resupply}} his squadron at the Cape itself before searching for the China Fleet, but the crew of a merchant ship captured in the South Atlantic informed him that the Dutch governors had surrendered on 10 January 1806 to an expeditionary force under General Sir David Baird and Commodore Popham after five days of fighting. Turning away from the Cape, Willaumez decided to continue operations in the South Atlantic until April, when he put into Salvador in Brazil for supplies. Willaumez was <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> collected this information before attempting to anchor in Table Bay: Popham had ordered all ships and shore facilities to continue to fly the Dutch flag {{in the hope that}} enemy ships would be lured within range of the port's gun batteries. On 4 March this ruse worked successfully when the frigate Volontaire, detached from Willaumez's squadron in December, anchored in the midst of Popham's squadron without realising their identity. Hopelessly outnumbered, Captain Bretel {{had no choice but to}} surrender, the British boarding party discovering 217 British soldiers in the hold, captured by Willaumez from Redmill's convoy.|$|E

25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was initially}} assigned Albatros D.IIIs. It was also known to operate Fokker Dr.I triplanes, which were first introduced in August 1917.

25|$|The United States {{is rich in}} mineral {{resources}} and fertile farm soil, and it is <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a moderate climate. It also has extensive coastlines on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, {{as well as on}} the Gulf of Mexico. Rivers flow from far within the continent and the Great Lakes—five large, inland lakes along the U.S. border with Canada—provide additional shipping access. These extensive waterways have helped shape the country's economic growth over the years and helped bind America's 50 individual states together in a single economic unit.|$|E
25|$|In early 2005, {{the band}} started {{recording}} Howling Bells at Parr Street Studios in Liverpool. Some of Coldplay's equipment from the X sessions {{was still in}} the facility when Howling Bells arrived. They recorded Howling Bells in two to three months, with all the main vocal and instrument tracking done in real time, as if in a live setting. This was a staple of Nelson's recording approach. Due to the personal significance of her songs, Juanita had the studio lights turned off {{in order to make the}} recording experience feel more private. The band appreciated Nelson's techniques and studio abilities. They stated that he was great sonically and very adept at de-emphasising some songs that they had initially approached overzealously. They also expressed that they felt <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had the opportunity to work with the award-winning producer.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, Columbia Law School {{was one of}} the few {{law schools}} {{established}} in the United States before the Civil War. During the 18th and 19th centuries, most legal education took place in law offices, where young men, serving as apprentices or clerks,were set to copying documents and filling out legal forms under the supervision of an established attorney. For example, in New York John Jay, revolutionary founding father and first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, read law with Benjamin Kissam, whose busy practice kept his clerks occupied in transcribing records, pleadings, and opinions. Jay was <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> attentive supervision because the quality and time of learning the law varied greatly within the profession. Theodore Dwight, who had been head of the law department of Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, believed formal legal education, conducted in the classroom with regular lectures, was far superior to casual law office instruction.|$|E

The Entrance Cycle & Walking track, is a concrete path starting in at Picnic Point allowing for off road cycling alongside the lake. Fishing and boat ramp facilities are located at Picnic Point. The Entrance Memorial Park is located {{at the heart of the}} town and features a band stand with stunning views across the channel and lake. The park is home to the town Christmas tree, festooned with coloured lights every December.|$|E
25|$|Lancaster, as a {{historic}} city, {{has a wide}} range of historic buildings and venues. The city is <b>fortunate</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> retained many fine examples of Georgian architecture. Lancaster Castle, the Priory Church of St. Mary and the Edwardian Ashton Memorial are among many sites of historical importance. The city has numerous museums,including Lancaster City Museum, Maritime Museum, the Cottage Museum, and Judges' Lodgings Museum. Lancaster Friends Meeting House dating from 1708, is the longest continual Quaker meeting site in the world with the original building built in 1677. George Fox, founder of Quakerism, was near the site several occasions in the 1660s and spent two years imprisoned in Lancaster Castle. The meeting house today holds regular Quaker meetings and {{a wide range of}} cultural activities including adult learning, meditation, art classes, music and political meetings. The Lancaster Grand Theatre is another one of Lancaster historic cultural venues, under its many names, has been {{a major part of the}} social and cultural life of Lancaster since being built in 1782.|$|E
