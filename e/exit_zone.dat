50|$|Additional {{advances}} {{in understanding the}} etiology and improving treatments for hemifacial spasm did not occur until the mid-seventies. In 1977, 47 cases of hemifacial spasm underwent microvascular decompression {{of the facial nerve}} using the operating microscope. The results illustrated nerve-vessel conflicts (or cholesteatoma) to be located at the root <b>exit</b> <b>zone</b> of the facial nerve in all cases. The root <b>exit</b> <b>zone</b> is where the central glial axonal insulation of the nerve ends and the peripheral nerve axonal myelination begins. Biopsies of the root <b>exit</b> <b>zone</b> demonstrated degeneration of axons, denuded axis cylinder and interrupted myelin. The results of the experiment strengthened the theory that vascular compression of the facial nerve was the primary cause of hemifacial spasm, and proposed a specific region of the facial nerve where the effects of longstanding compression results in nerve dysfunction.|$|E

The topology is determined by tracking moving objects and establishing object correspondence across multiple cameras. To track people successfully in multiple camera views, we used the Merge-Split (MS) approach for object occlusion in a single camera and the grid-based approach for extracting the accurate object feature. In addition, we considered the appearance of people and the transition time between entry and <b>exit</b> <b>zones</b> for tracking objects across blind regions of multiple cameras with non-overlapping FOVs. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} to estimate transition times between various entry and <b>exit</b> <b>zones,</b> and to graphically represent the camera topology as an undirected weighted graph using the transition probabilities.

In this anatomic study, foraminal apertures were evaluated by MRI at the entry, middle, and <b>exit</b> <b>zones</b> of the nerve roots in 30 dogs that were clinically affected by lumbosacral disease. Standard vs. oblique planar orientation and neutral vs. hyperextended positioning of the lumbosacral area were compared by measuring the median values for entry, middle, and <b>exit</b> <b>zones.</b> The neuroforaminal area acquired using oblique plane acquisition was significantly smaller than standard parasagittal measurements. Furthermore, standard parasagittal neuroforaminal dimensions in the hyperextended position were significantly smaller than standard parasagittal measurements in the neutral position. This statistical difference was even more pronounced for neuroforaminal dimension evaluated in the oblique plane and hyperextended position. Positioning of the dog during imaging has a significant effect on neuroforaminal dimension, corroborating the notion that spinal position may influence neural claudication in clinically affected patients. Reductions in neuroforaminal dimension are more evident on oblique planar image acquisition, suggesting that this approach may be more useful than parasagittal imaging as a tool for identifying subtle changes in L 7 neuroforaminal dimensions in cases of canine {{lumbosacral stenosis}}...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—In {{microvascular}} decompression for hemifacial spasm, the perforating branches {{around the}} facial nerve root <b>exit</b> <b>zone</b> occasionally complicate facial nerve decompression. In this context, the vertebrobasilar configuration was retrospectively correlated with the perforating branches.  METHODS—Based on vertebral angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and three dimensional computed tomographic angiography, 69 patients were divided into three groups, according to the anatomy of the vertebrobasilar system. In patients with the type I configuration, the vertebral artery on the affected side was dominant and had a sigmoidal course. The type II patients had the basilar artery curving mainly towards the affected side. The type III patients showed the basilar artery either running straight or curving toward the unaffected side. The relation of the anatomical configuration of these vessels with the perforating branches around {{the facial nerve}} <b>exit</b> <b>zone</b> was investigated.  RESULTS—The posterior inferior cerebellar artery in type I patients (n= 33) and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery in type II (n= 5) and type III (n= 31) patients were the most common offending arteries. More {{than half of the}} type I patients (n= 20) showed no perforating branches around the facial nerve <b>exit</b> <b>zone.</b> However, the type II (n= 3) and III patients (n= 23) often showed one or more perforating branches around that region.  CONCLUSIONS—The configuration of the vertebrobasilar system has a significant correlation with the presence of perforating branches near the site of microvascular decompression. These perforating vessels are often responsible for the difficulty encountered in mobilising the offending artery during the procedure. ...|$|E

In this context, the verte-brobasilar configuration was retrospec-tively correlated with the perforating branches. Methods—Based on vertebral angio-graphy, magnetic resonance angiography, and three dimensional computed tomo-graphic angiography, 69 patients were divided into three groups, according to the anatomy of the vertebrobasilar system. In patients with the type I configuration, the vertebral artery on the aVected side was dominant and had a sigmoidal course. The type II patients had the basilar artery curving mainly towards the aVected side. The type III patients showed the basilar artery either running straight or curving toward the unaVected side. The relation of the anatomical configuration of these ves-sels with the perforating branches around the facial nerve <b>exit</b> <b>zone</b> was investigated. Results—The posterior inferior cerebellar artery in type I patients (n= 33) and the anterior inferior cerebellar artery in type II (n= 5) and type III (n= 31) patients were the most common oVending arteries.

40|$|Histological {{studies were}} {{performed}} on Lewis rats with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) passively transferred by myelin basic protein (MBP) -sensitized syngeneic spleen cells {{in order to determine}} the relationship between demyelination and neurological signs. Neither inflammation nor demyelination was present on the day prior to the onset of neurological signs but both were present in the spinal roots and spinal cord on the day of onset of tail weakness (4 days after passive transfer). Demyelination and the neurological signs both increased over the next 48 h. There was evidence that the caudal roots were more severely affected than the rostral roots. The peripheral nerves were spared. Demyelination in the spinal cord was concentrated in the dorsal root entry and ventral root <b>exit</b> <b>zones.</b> The initial stages of repair of demyelinated spinal root fibres by Schwann cells were observed on the earliest day that clinical recovery commenced (day 7). At this time some demyelinated fibres were closely associated with debris-free Schwann cells, and occasional fibres were completely invested by 1 - 2 layers of Schwann cell cytoplasm. Remyelination (compact myelin lamellae formation) by Schwann cells was first observed in the spinal roots on day 9. By the time of complete clinical recovery (day 11) the majority of affected spinal root fibres had thin new myelin sheaths. Repair of central nervous system myelin by oligodendrocytes was slower than peripheral nervous system myelin repair. Investment of demyelinated spinal cord axons by oligodendrocytes was observed on day 9, and remyelination by these cells was seen on day 10. We conclude that the neurological signs of passively induced MBP-EAE can be accounted for by demyelination of the lumbar, sacral and coccygeal spinal roots and spinal cord root entry and <b>exit</b> <b>zones,</b> and that the subsequent clinical recovery can be explained by investment and remyelination of demyelinated peripheral and central nervous system fibres by Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes respectively...|$|R

Precipitated secondary minerals during the treatment process usually accumulate on the pore spaces (clogging) and on the reactive surfaces (armouring) of recycled concrete aggregates. Clogging and armouring reduce the porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the reactive media. Finite different codes available in MODFLOW and RT 3 D software were utilized for time-dependent modelling. The model predictions were in agreement with the laboratory and field data.
