500|$|Gielgud {{was in the}} Oxford {{company in}} January and February 1924, from October 1924 {{to the end of}} January 1925, and in August 1925. He played a wide range of parts in {{classics}} and modern plays, greatly increasing his technical abilities in the process. The role he most enjoyed was Trofimov in The Cherry Orchard, his first experience of Chekhov: [...] "It was the first time I ever went out on stage feeling that perhaps, after all, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> be an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|Kills {{described}} {{working with}} will.i.am, [...] " [...] it's almost difficult having a normal {{conversation with him}} because he's firing out ideas all the time. [...] His entire life revolves around creativity, and that's something <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> relate to." [...] Kierszenbaum praised Kills' work ethic during the recording sessions, stating that she would focus simultaneously on the melodic and lyrical structure of song, {{as well as its}} soundscape. He {{went on to say that}} she [...] "influenced the timbre of the sound" [...] and assisted the production as if [...] "she's making a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|Charity Wakefield {{successfully}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Marianne Dashwood. The actress revealed, [...] "Marianne is the embodiment of youth and hope. I was so excited to be offered the part because I felt that it was a role which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> attack. I understand her character and feel that we have lots in common." [...] Dan Stevens was chosen to play Edward Ferrars, Elinor's love interest. The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character. Stevens became ill with tonsillitis during the shoot, and quipped that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Mr. Hoopdriver. [...] "That's it. You can't do much at drapery without capital, you know. But if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get <b>really</b> educated. I've thought sometimes..." ...|$|R
500|$|... "The lion didn't do {{anything}} {{he was supposed to}} do, and I ended up leaning against this pillar with his head in my crotch... I {{thought he was going to}} take a bite out of me so I lifted the veil I was wearing and had a stare-down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar. I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{was pleased}} that Wyman directed, as he found it nice to have [...] "somebody who's in the writer's room day-in and day-out and knows the show so intimately, come in and jump behind the camera and are just a font of information." [...] Seth Gabel was also happy with Wyman's direction, as the two were able to discuss themes in the script {{as well as how}} Wyman planned to shoot certain scenes. Gabel remarked that the {{director}} [...] "wanted to do this fun thing that actually related to Lincoln's feelings about Olivia and how they were changing based on everything that's been happening. We played so many things that weren't in the script, that were between the lines in just looks, and he told me how he was gonna shoot it so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> play with what the character was thinking and know that it would actually be seen in the end, and not end up on the cutting room floor because it wasn't in the script." ...|$|E
500|$|A bird-beaked {{member of}} the Green Lantern Corps who teaches Hal Jordan how to use his cosmic powers. Rush stated he was not {{initially}} familiar with Green Lantern but {{was drawn to the}} part after seeing the concept art explaining, [...] "When I got the offer for it I said, ‘Haven’t they made that film?’ They said, ‘No, it’s a completely computer-generated character.’ I saw the artwork and I said, I would love to be that guy. Because I had voiced an owl in [...] and I’d voiced a pelican in Finding Nemo and I thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> improve on that now by being half-bird, half-fish, part lizard. You don’t get to do that in a live-action film." [...] Rush compared the role to previous roles where he played a mentoring figure, [...] "You could say that I’ve mentored Queen Elizabeth I as [...] Walsingham, and [...] Trotsky has mentored Frida Kahlo and now Tomar Re is going to mentor Hal Jordan, and I was sort of mentoring King George VI in The King's Speech. But I can’t imagine Tomar Re setting up an office on Harley Street in London. They’re all very different people to me, but {{there is a kind of}} theme I suppose".|$|E
60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>really</b> tell you, citizens, what suspicions had by {{this time}} entered Hercule's head or mine; {{certainly}} what suspicions we did have were still very vague.|$|R
5000|$|Regarding Reagan, Morris claimed, [...] "Nobody {{around him}} {{understood}} him. I, every person I interviewed, almost without exception, eventually would say, 'You know, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>really</b> figure him out.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That wouldn't be true," [...] objected Dorothy, [...] "for I've {{always loved}} {{her as much}} as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and, <b>really,</b> Toto, <b>I</b> want to give Ozma some PRESENT, 'cause {{everyone}} else will give her a present." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{a letter}} to his mother from prison, Rudolph has written, [...] "Many good people {{continue}} to send me money and books. Most of them have, of course, an agenda; mostly born-again Christians looking to save my soul. I suppose the assumption is made that because I'm in here I must be a 'sinner' in need of salvation, and they would be glad to sell me a ticket to heaven, hawking this salvation like peanuts at a ballgame. I do appreciate their charity, but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> do without the condescension. They have been so nice I would hate to break it to them that I really prefer Nietzsche to the Bible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later {{on in the}} letter, Gottlieb {{stated that}} he still had faith in Toole {{as a writer and}} that he wished to hold onto the {{manuscript}} in case he or Toole would be able to see a way around his objections. Toole decided that it would be best for Gottlieb to return the manuscript, saying [...] "Aside from a few deletions, I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> do much to the book now—and of course even with revisions you might not be satisfied." [...] Toole made a trip to New York to see Gottlieb in person; however, he was out of town and Toole came back disappointed. He felt that he had embarrassed himself by giving a rambling, uncomfortable speech explaining his situation to one of Gottlieb's office staff. He returned home having left a note for Gottlieb to call him, and they later talked for an hour on the phone. In this conversation Gottlieb re-iterated that he would not accept the novel without further revision. He suggested that Toole move on to writing something else, an idea which Toole ultimately rejected.|$|E
2500|$|Tommy Lee of Mötley Crüe fame played drums on [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". Due {{to various}} {{personal}} and legal struggles, Lee {{was living in}} the studio for a time during the recording of the album. Humphrey was a good friend of Lee's, and had previously worked with his band prior to the production of Hellbilly Deluxe. Zombie later asked Lee to appear on the album, with Lee agreeing to do so. On the collaboration, Lee stated [...] "I went to his house after I got out of jail to stay for a while, and I think I was there about a day or two and they were working on the record downstairs and Scott and Rob were like, 'Dude, Tommy’s upstairs, we should ask him to play.' And they asked me to play and I was like, 'I would love to play right now. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> use ... you know, just kind of check out, really do some music' and I ended up playing like four tracks or so on the record." [...] Lee is credited as the drummer for [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] and [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore". [...] "Meet the Creeper" [...] was originally referred to as [...] "Creature Core" [...] prior to the release of the album. Danny Lohner provided additional guitar recordings for [...] "Meet the Creeper". Zombie recorded a song titled [...] "Wish It Away" [...] for the album, though it was not included on the final product.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was truly}} {{one of the}} strangest men who's ever lived. Nobody around him {{understood}} him. I, every person I interviewed, almost without exception, eventually would say, [...] "You know, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>really</b> figure him out." ...|$|R
5000|$|MC Lyte declared, “I {{was totally}} psyched {{to be in}} a video with Janet Jackson. The only thing I wish I did know how to do was dance laughs. Have I been able to dance <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>really</b> participated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> But <b>really,</b> you know, I find {{it so hard}} {{to believe}} it is not all a joke, despite the grave deputations that have waited on me, and the serious {{arguments}} they have used. The idea of making me--Me--a Queen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{took time}} to {{consider}} this. [...] "I might have been vexed, or hurt, I suppose, but I don't see how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> have been offended." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. G. I wish--I wish so {{much that}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> help you. I believe I could--if I left the room. But that's not what I mean.|$|E
6000|$|Nick {{looked at}} her askance. [...] "You say things {{every now and then}} for which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> kill you. 'The article of the month,' for instance: I could kill you for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Marian saw that, {{though there}} would be many a little expense to make a mickle one, yet it would still only cost her Mrs. Jameson, instead of the gifts to the poor people; but as this was what chiefly {{justified}} her in her own eyes, she would not admit the conviction, and answered, [...] "Those things that are altered and adapted really are as costly in the end {{as if they were}} new altogether. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>could</b> not shoot before such an assembly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You must excuse me," [...] she said, {{when she}} was able to speak, [...] "but this is so sudden my mind is not {{prepared}} for it. And so you wish to become a brother of the House of Martha? I would be solemn about it if <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> but <b>really</b> <b>I</b> cannot," [...] and again she laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "It couldn’t be done proper," [...] {{said the}} mate; [...] "they’d see through it. We’ve sailed {{together}} five years now, an’ never ’ad what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> call a <b>really</b> nasty word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> {{think that}} thou likenest me, in any way, with that {{managing}} and false-faced King of Aragon, much as I love thee, Mercedes, I would withdraw, forever, in pure shame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} teacher, [...] "but here are {{fifteen or twenty}} boys tardy this morning; now {{how long would it}} take me to hear their excuses, and {{understand}} each case thoroughly, so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> tell whether they were tardy from good reasons or not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lovely? Well, I don't {{know why}} it isn't the word. It suits him a great deal better than some insipid girls that people give it to. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> {{fall in love with}} Mr. Hinkle. He's the only man I ever saw who would know how to break the fall!" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>could</b> not endure this. [...] "I have my {{own opinion}} of what you deserve," [...] I answered. [...] "Don't provoke me to mention it." ...|$|R
60|$|ERMYNTRUDE. You may laugh, Sir; but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>could</b> {{not live}} in that style. I am the widow of a millionaire, ruined by your little war.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} it is of the least use to pursue her with any further overtures. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>could</b> not {{undertake}} to conduct them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "`Yes,' he {{said with}} a huge sigh, `I am free in Russia. You are right. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> walk into that town over there and have love all over again, and perhaps marry some {{beautiful}} woman and begin again, and nobody could ever find me. Yes, you have certainly convinced me of something.' ...|$|E
60|$|June 15.--I laboured all the evening, {{but made}} little way. There were many books to consult; {{and so all}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> do was to make out my task of three pages. I {{will try to make}} up the deficit of Tuesday to-day and to-morrow. Letters from Walter--all well. A visit {{yesterday}} from Charles Sharpe.|$|E
6000|$|... "You will be {{surprised}} to see how near I am to you. Paris became impossible--and I have come here to be within reach of your advice. I would so love to see you again. Since you left Paris I don't think I have met anyone <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>really</b> talk to. Is all well with you and with your boy? No one knows, I think, that I am here at present.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{you seem}} so sympathetic, so understanding. I feel that {{all sorts of}} things that are muddled in my mind would come clear if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have a <b>really</b> Good Talk. To you...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But don't imagine to {{yourself}} that I make myself bad blood on that account. I {{took them to}} oblige Monsieur Stroeve, and I said I would sell them if <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> But <b>really</b> --" [...] He shrugged his shoulders. [...] "I'm interested in the young men, but <i voyons>, you yourself, Monsieur Stroeve, you don't think there's any talent there." ...|$|R
5000|$|To {{compliment}} Electronic Dream's {{sound and}} success, AraabMuzik {{began working on}} a full length official album Dream World, slated for a 2015 release. However, it ended up being delayed numerous times; he was quoted saying [...] "I pushed it back so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> still <b>really</b> perfect it and work on it more, because I didn't really feel like I was satisfied with it." ...|$|R
