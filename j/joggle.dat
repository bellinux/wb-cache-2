He praised her work but suggested that she delay publishing until she had written longer, being unaware that she had already appeared in print. She assured him that publishing was as foreign to her [...] "as Firmament to Fin", but also proposed that [...] "If fame belonged to me, I could not escape her". Dickinson delighted in dramatic self-characterization and mystery in her letters to Higginson. She said of herself, [...] "I am small, like the wren, and my hair is bold, like the chestnut bur, and my eyes like the sherry in the glass that the guest leaves." [...] She stressed her solitary nature, stating that her only real companions were the hills, the sundown, and her dog, Carlo. She also mentioned that whereas her mother did not [...] "care for Thought", her father bought her books, but begged her [...] "not to read them– because he fears they <b>joggle</b> the Mind".|$|E
2500|$|While {{generally}} considered a beautiful design, the Cross of Sacrifice {{is not a}} robust one. The artwork is susceptible to toppling in high wind, as the shaft is held upright only by a [...] long piece of stone and a single bronze dowel. [...] Should the stone <b>joggle</b> or dowel break, the shaft topples. This problem quickly became apparent in Europe, where {{a large number of}} the crosses fell in high winds in the 1920s and 1930s. At one point, the Imperial War Graves Commission considered suing Blomfield for under-designing the artwork, but no lawsuit was ever filed.|$|E
2500|$|The Cross of Sacrifice is {{carved from}} white stone. This is usually Portland stone, {{but it is}} {{sometimes}} granite or any type of white limestone commonly found in France or Belgium. In Italy, Chiampo Perla limestone was used. The proportions of the cross, with short arms close {{to the top of}} the shaft are similar to some Celtic crosses, the crossarm being one-third the length of the shaft (as measured from the point where the shaft emerges from the base). The cross consists of three pieces: The shaft, from base to crossarm; the crossarm; and the upper shaft, above the crossarm. The crossarm is fastened to the lower and upper shaft by two bronze dowels. [...] A <b>joggle</b> (a portion of the shaft which extends into the base, acting as a joint) about [...] long extends into the base, where it is secured by another bronze dowel. The shaft and crossarm are both octagonal in shape, and the shaft tapers slightly as it rises to give the cross entasis. [...] On the large size version, there are three plain mouldings on the shaft near the base, often reduced to one in smaller sizes, and the three extremities of the cross finish at a plain moulding projecting sideways from the main element. The crossarms are sometimes irregular octagons in section, with four wide faces at front, back, top and bottom, and four shorter faces in between them.|$|E

Shortly after that, they faced off at the 2006 Boston Marathon, {{which was the first}} time two jogglers had ever participated in the same marathon. Kapral would go on to regain, lose and regain the world record, setting the current marathon <b>joggling</b> world record with a time of 2:50:12 in 2007, while also chewing gum throughout the race.

50|$|<b>Joggling</b> was {{conceived}} by Bill Giduz in 1975. The first official <b>joggling</b> event {{took place at}} the 1981 International Jugglers' Association festival in North Dakota. The sport has two primary rules: a runner must juggle at least three objects every step of the way, and if the object drops, the runner must pick it up and continue running from the point where the drop occurred. Kapral first learned of <b>joggling</b> at the age of 11, when he saw the world record listed in The Guinness Book of World Records, and started running after graduating from college. He completed his first marathon in 1999, and in 2002 won the Toronto Marathon with a time of 2:30:40, his best overall marathon time. Earlier that year, he was the top Canadian finisher at the Boston Marathon.|$|R

I start {{in a few hours}} straight for California--enter my train this, Monday, night 7.30, and reach Los Angeles and Pasadena at 2.30 Thursday afternoon. The train has, I believe, barber's shops, bathrooms, stenographers and typists; so that if I can add a postscript, without too much <b>joggle,</b> I will. But you will say [...] "Here is <b>joggle</b> enough," [...] for alack, I am already (after 17 days of the [...] "great Middle West") rather spent and weary, weary of motion and chatter, and oh, of such an unimagined dreariness of ugliness (on many, on most sides!) and of the perpetual effort of trying to [...] "do justice" [...] to what one doesn't like.

This Chicago is huge, infinite (of potential size and form, and even of actual;) black, smoky, old-looking, very like some preternaturally boomed Manchester or Glasgow lying beside a colossal lake (Michigan) of hard pale green jade, and putting forth railway antennae of maddening complexity and gigantic length. Yet this club (which looks old and sober too!) is an abode of peace, a benediction to me in the looming largeness; I live here, and they put one up (always, everywhere,) with one's so excellent room with perfect bathroom and w.c. of its own, appurtenant (the universal joy of this country, in private houses or wherever; a feature that is really almost a consolation for many things.)

6000|$|SCENE I.--A Room in SIR TUNBELLY CLUMSY'S House. Enter MISS HOYDEN and NURSE. Nurse. Well, miss, how do {{you like}} your husband that is to be? Miss Hoyd. O Lord, nurse, I'm so overjoyed I can scarce contain myself! Nurse. Oh, but you must have a care of being too fond; for men, nowadays, hate a woman that loves 'em. Miss Hoyd. Love him! why, do you think I love him, nurse? Ecod I would not care if he was hanged, so I were but once married to him. No, that which pleases me is to think what work I'll make when I get to London; for when I am a wife and a lady both, ecod, I'll flaunt it with the best of 'em. Ay, and I shall have money enough to do so too, nurse. Nurse. Ah, there's no knowing that, miss; for though these lords have a power of wealth indeed, yet, as I have heard say, they give it all to their sluts and their trulls, who <b>joggle</b> it about in their coaches, with a murrain to 'em, whilst poor madam sits sighing and wishing, and has not a spare half-crown to buy her a Practice of Piety. Miss Hoyd. Oh, but for that, don't deceive yourself, nurse; for this I must say of my lord, he's as free as an open house at Christmas; for this very morning he told me I should have six hundred a year to buy pins. Now if he gives me six hundred a year to buy pins, what do you think he'll give me to buy petticoats? Nurse. Ay, my dearest, he deceives thee foully, and he's no better than a rogue for his pains! These Londoners have got a gibberish with 'em would {{confound}} a gipsy. That which they call pin-money, is to buy everything in the versal world, down to their very shoe-knots. Nay, I have heard some folks say that some ladies, if they'll have gallants as they call 'em, are forced to find them out of their pin-money too.--But look, look, if his honour be not coming to you!--Now, if I were sure you would behave yourself handsomely, and not disgrace me that have brought you up, I'd leave you alone together. Miss Hoyd. That's my best nurse; do as you'd be done by. Trust us together this once, and if I don't show my breeding, I wish I may never be married, but die an old maid. Nurse. Well, this once I'll venture you. But if you disparage me-- Miss Hoyd. Never fear. [Exit NURSE.] Enter TOM FASHION. Fash. Your servant, madam; I'm glad to find you alone, for I have something of importance to speak to you about. Miss Hoyd. Sir (my lord, I meant), you may speak to me about what you please, I shall give you a civil answer. Fash. You give so obliging an one, it encourages me to tell you in a few words what I think, both for your interest and mine. Your father, I suppose you know, has resolved to make me happy in being your husband; and I hope I may obtain your consent to perform what he desires. Miss Hoyd. Sir, I never disobey my father in anything but eating green gooseberries. Fash. So good a daughter must needs be an admirable wife. I am therefore impatient till you are mine, and hope you will so far consider the violence of my love, that you won't have the cruelty to defer my happiness so long as your father designs it. Miss Hoyd. Pray, my lord, how long is that? Fash. Madam, a thousand years--a whole week. Miss Hoyd. Why, I thought it was to be to-morrow morning, as soon as I was up. I'm sure nurse told me so. Fash. And it shall be to-morrow morning, if you'll consent. Miss Hoyd. If I'll consent! Why I thought I was to obey you as my husband. Fash. That's when we are married. Till then, I'm to obey you. Miss Hoyd. Why then, if we are to take it by turns, it's the same thing. I'll obey you now, and when we are married you shall obey me. Fash. With all my heart. But I doubt we must get nurse on our side, or we shall hardly prevail with the chaplain. Miss Hoyd. No more we shan't, indeed; for he loves her better than he loves his pulpit, and would always be a-preaching to her by his good will. Fash. Why then, my dear, if you'll call her hither we'll persuade her presently. Miss Hoyd. O Lud! I'll tell you a way how to persuade her to anything. Fash. How's that? Miss Hoyd. Why tell her she's a handsome comely woman, and give her half a crown. Fash. Nay, if that will do, she shall have half a score of 'em. Miss Hoyd. O gemini! for half that she'd marry you herself.--I'll run and call her. [Exit.] Fash. So! matters go on swimmingly. This is a rare girl, i'faith. I shall have a fine time on't with her at London. Enter LORY. So, Lory, what's the matter? Lory. Here, sir--an intercepted packet from the enemy; your brother's postilion brought it. I knew the livery, pretended to be a servant of Sir Tunbelly's, and so got possession of the letter. Fash. [Looks at the letter.] Ouns! he tells Sir Tunbelly here that he will be with him this evening, with a large party to supper.--Egad, I must marry the girl directly. Lory. Oh, zounds, sir, directly to be sure. Here she comes. [Exit.] Fash. And the old Jezebel with her. Re-enter MISS HOYDEN and NURSE. How do you do, good Mrs. Nurse? I desired your young lady would give me leave to see you, that I might thank you for your extraordinary care and kind conduct in her education: pray accept this small acknowledgment for it at present, and depend upon my further kindness when I shall be that happy thing, her husband. [Gives her money.] Nurse. [Aside.] Gold, by the maakins!-- [Aloud.] Your honour's goodness is too great. Alas! all I can boast of is, I gave her pure and good milk, and so your honour would have said, an you had seen how the poor thing thrived, and how it would look up in my face, and crow and laugh, it would. Miss Hoyd. [To NURSE, taking her angrily aside.] Pray, one word with you. Pr'ythee, nurse, don't stand ripping up old stories, to make one ashamed before one's love. Do you think such a fine proper gentleman as he is cares for a fiddlecome tale of a child? If you have a mind to make him have a good opinion of a woman, don't tell him what one did then, tell him what one can do now.--[To Tom FASHION.] I hope your honour will excuse my mis-manners to whisper before you. It was only to give some orders about the family. Fash. Oh, everything, madam, is to give way to business; besides, good housewifery is a very commendable quality in a young lady. Miss Hoyd. Pray, sir, are young ladies good housewives at London-town? Do they darn their own linen? Fash. Oh no, they study how to spend money, not to save. Miss Hoyd. Ecod, I don't know but that may be better sport, eh, nurse? Fash. Well, you have your choice, when you come there. Miss Hoyd. Shall I? then, by my troth, I'll get there as fast as I can.--[To NURSE.] His honour desires you'll be so kind as to let us be married to-morrow. Nurse. To-morrow, my dear madam? Fash. Ay, faith, nurse, you may well be surprised at miss's wanting to put it off so long. To-morrow! no, no; 'tis now, this very hour, I would have the ceremony performed. Miss Hoyd. Ecod, with all my heart. Nurse. O mercy! worse and worse! Fash. Yes, sweet nurse, now and privately; for all things being signed and sealed, why should Sir Tunbelly make us stay a week for a wedding-dinner? Nurse. But if you should be married now, what will you do when Sir Tunbelly calls for you to be married? Miss Hoyd. Why then we will be married again. Nurse. What twice, my child? Miss Hoyd. Ecod, I don't care how often I'm married, not I. Nurse. Well, I'm such a tender-hearted fool, I find I can refuse you nothing. So you shall e'en follow your own inventions. Miss Hoyd. Shall I? O Lord, I could leap over the moon! Fash. Dear nurse, this goodness of yours shall be still more rewarded. But now you must employ your power with the chaplain, that he may do this friendly office too, and then we shall be all happy. Do you think you can prevail with him? Nurse. Prevail with him! or he shall never prevail with me, I can tell him that. Fash. I'm glad to hear it; however, to strengthen your interest with him, you may let him know I have several fat livings in my gift, and that the first that falls shall be in your disposal. Nurse. Nay, then, I'll make him marry more folks than one, I'll promise him! Miss Hoyd. Faith, do, nurse, make him marry you too; I'm sure he'll do't for a fat living. Fash. Well, nurse, while you go and settle matters with him, your lady and I will go and take a walk in the garden.-- [Exit NURSE.] Come, madam, dare you venture yourself alone with me? [Takes MISS HOYDEN by the hand.] Miss Hoyd. Oh dear, yes, sir; I don't think you'll do anythink to me, I need be afraid on. [Exeunt.] ...|$|E
