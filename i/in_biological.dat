5|$|Insects play an {{important}} role <b>in</b> <b>biological</b> research. Because of its small size, short generation time and high fecundity, the common fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster was selected as a model organism for studies of the genetics of higher eukaryotes. D. melanogaster has been an essential part of studies into principles like genetic linkage, interactions between genes, chromosomal genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, animal behaviour and evolution. Because genetic systems are well conserved among eukaryotes, understanding basic cellular processes like DNA replication or transcription in fruit flies helps scientists to understand those processes in other eukaryotes, including humans. The genome of D. melanogaster was sequenced in 2000, reflecting the fruit fly's important role <b>in</b> <b>biological</b> research. 70% of the fly genome is similar to the human genome, supporting the Darwinian theory of evolution from a single origin of life.|$|E

Models show that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of DNA damage.

The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{that employ}} many {{strategies}} to obtain food or feed {{on a variety}} of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists.

Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged <b>in</b> <b>biological</b> pest control programmes.|$|E
