40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increased}} interest in the extent to which managers can improve their property portfolio position through international diversification. Much of this research interest has centred around the use of various statistical/econometric tests of time varying correlations and long run equilibrium positions using whole of country property indices. In this article we effectively adopt a short-run ‘tactical asset allocation ’ approach to securitised property only international diversification. Using neural network methodology we build a neural network model that `learns ’ well established rules of portfolio investment using a set of individual property companies across three of the most highly securitised property markets in the world viz. the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. We ask the model to compare portfolios constructed purely from domestic assets with portfolios constructed from internationally held assets allowing for foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>adjustments.</b> When the foreign exchange risk is actively managed the outcomes from the analysis suggest that the gains from hedging are conditional on both the return to the unhedged position an...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{investigate}} whether a monetary union between economies of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) is viable by analyzing the nature, extent and consequences of shocks in these economies during 1990 - 2009. This study analyzes internal shocks captured by demand and supply shocks, and external shocks captured by exchange rate shocks. The study adopts the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) approach to identify and analyze shocks based on the aggregate demand-aggregate supply framework, while for external shocks, exchange rates variability, symmetry and persistence is analyzedfollowing the framework developed by Von Hagen and Neumann (1994). The empirical results suggest that there is a possibility for a monetary union in the COMESA region. However, an untimely monetary union can hurt the participating economies by exposing them to large variations in prices to facilitate real <b>exchange</b> <b>adjustments.</b> In addition, with less than optimal factor mobility in these countries {{and in the absence of}} an effective compensating mechanism, a monetary union might make these countries more vulnerable to shocks, thereby limiting the potential benefits of monetary integration...|$|E

This study employs the monetary-portfolio balance exchange rate model and its unrestricted version {{in the analysis of}} Malaysian Ringgit during the post-Bretton Wood era (1991 M 1 - 2012 M 12), before and after the subprime crisis. We compare two Artificial Neural Network (ANN) estimation procedures (MLFN and GRNN) with the random walks (RW) and the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) methods. The out-of-sample forecasting assessment reveals the following. First, the unrestricted model has superior forecasting performance compared to the original model during the 24 -month forecasting horizon. Second, the ANNs have outperformed both the RW and VAR forecasts in all cases. Third, the MLFNs consistently outperform the GRNNs in both exchange rate models in all evaluation criteria. Fourth, forecasting performance is weakened when the post-subprime crisis period was included. In brief, economic fundamentals are still vital in forecasting the Malaysian Ringgit, but the monetary mechanism may not sufficiently work through foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the short run due to global uncertainties. These findings are beneficial for policy making, investment modelling, and corporate planning. © Asian Academy of Management and Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2013...|$|E

40|$|A dynamic dependent-economy {{model is}} {{developed}} {{to investigate the}} role of the real exchange rate in determining the effects of foreign aid. If capital is perfectly mobile between sectors, untied aid has no longrun impact on the real exchange rate. A decline in the traded sector occurs because aid, being denominated in traded output, substitutes for exports in financing imports. While untied aid causes short-run real exchange appreciation, this response is very temporary and negligibly small. Tied aid, by influencing sectoral productivity, does generate permanent relative price effects. The analysis, which employs extensive numerical simulations, emphasizes the tradeoffs between real <b>exchange</b> <b>adjustments,</b> long-run capital accumulation, and economic welfare, associated with alternative forms of foreign aid.

40|$|Prior to the {{issuance}} of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 8 (SFAS No. 8), there was a marked inconsistency {{in the area of}} accounting for foreign currency translation. Though designed to make the diverse accounting practices of multinational corporations (MNCs) more compatible, SFAS No. 8 {{was the subject of a}} great deal of criticism, eventually leading to {{the issuance}} of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 52 (SFAS No. 52). SFAS No. 52 differs from SFAS No. 8 on objectives and method of translation, and on accounting treatments of translation adjustments. This dissertation provides an empirical examination of the security market reaction to the accounting policy change embodied in SFAS No. 52, and its impact on the volatility of reported earnings of MNCs. The effects of the issuance and early adoption of SFAS No. 52 on security return distributions were determined by both cross-sectional comparisons of cumulative average residuals (CAR) between MNCs and domestic firms and between early and late adopters, and by time-series tests on CAR of MNCs. Two volume analyses were performed to test the effects of SFAS No. 52 on security volume. The first analysis was adjusted to remove the effects of the marketwide factors on volume, and the second analysis was unadjusted for the market influences. Four nonparametric tests were used in testing the effects of SFAS No. 52 vis-a-vis SFAS No. 8 on the volatility of reported earnings of MNCs. The findings of this study led to the following conclusions: (1) SFAS No. 52 had significantly affected security returns of MNCs, but had no significant effects on security volume of MNCs; (2) the early adoption of SFAS No. 52 had no effects on security returns and volume of early adopters as opposed to late adopters; and (3) SFAS No. 52 did not have any significant effects on the volatility of reported earnings of MNCs.

40|$|Abstract This study {{tries to}} show empirically the short-run {{monetary}} effects of commodity exports price {{changes on the}} nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> in Indonesia via money supply and domestic inflation rate for the period 1999 to 2012. It is concentrated on commodity oil and an average of {{the rate of change}} in the world price of four main commodity exports (oil, rubber, palm oil, plywood). This study examines {{the extent to which the}} rate of depreciation or appreciation of the Indonesia???s currency, rupiah, has responded to the world price changes of these commodities. Based on the monetary approach to nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustments,</b> this study used the analytical model of Edwards (1986) as well as Reviane (1992) which looks at interactions among commodity export prices, money creation, inflation, and the nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment.</b> In case for cil commodity, this study finds that the changes in the world price of oil has positive effect to the money growth only, but has not influenced the nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> directly and indirectly through money creation and the domestic inflation. However, in case of three commodities (rubber, palm oil, plywood) has positive effect to the money growth, and has negative effect to the nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> directly and indirectly through money creation and the domestic inflation. Finally, in case of four commodities (oil, rubber, palm oil, plywood) finds that changes in the average of the world price of rubber, palm oil and plywood together with oil price changes have negative effect only to the nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment.</b> The implication of this study is that, for Indonesia, the world price of oil is no longer plays a dominant role on their nominal <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment.</b> On the other hand, the policy-makers should fully sterilized the accumulation of international reserves when the world price of main commodity export increases...|$|R

40|$|Through the {{research}} perspective of U. S. nuclear assistance programs to Italy under the {{fixed exchange rate}} international monetary regime of Bretton Woods, this paper investigates the meaning and importance of high technology transfer {{in the framework of}} the international economic policy of the United States government and the Bretton Woods institutions, particularly the World Bank Group. Through the case study of the country most dependent on foreign energy supply both during the Bretton Woods years and after the demise of currency convertibility, we follow the U. S. assistance programs to erect and to develop an Italian nuclear energy industry. We aim to shed light on the linkage between the development of capital intensive sectors and the American aim to make the reintegration of each advanced industrial economy in the postwar system of international economic relations revolve around the combining non-inflationary domestic economic growth and stable external equilibrium, including both foreign exchange stability and sound terms of trade. We make the argument that the U. S. pursued this combination both during and after the collapse of Bretton Woods international monetary arrangements by drawing upon a flow of high capital intensive technology transfer. Furthermore, while focusing only on the period prior to floating currencies in the 1970 s, this article maintains that Washington carried out this foreign economic policy both under the Bretton Woods regime and after its demise, through foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>adjustments</b> and financial assistance programs respectively. After reviewing how the leading literature on the history of U. S. foreign economic policy has portrayed it so far, we focus attention on the Italian case to explore the hypothesis that both under Bretton Woods and after its collapse a very close interlocking was established between exchange rate regimes and the U. S. policy of technology transfer. Through the case study of Italy, we make the argument that prior to the deterioration of fixed exchange rate arrangements Washington provided Rome with technological assistance to target the twin objective of advancing expansionary internal economic policies and pushing forward an ever-rising level of international economic integration of her partner industrial economies. We frame this reconstruction on the decades prior to currency floating before a broader interpretation about the meanings of U. S. financial assistance in the field of high capital intensive manufacturing way beyond the collapse of fixed exchange rates and the end of cheap foreign energy supply...|$|E
40|$|An {{agricultural}} protection policy {{is very common}} among industrial countries. However, there are actual pro and con arguments for it because someone must bear its cost. Even in Japan, consumers themselves do not necessarily object to increasing the importation of agricultural products. It may not be easy for today's advanced industrial countries to determine the criteria for opening their agricultural markets completely since to implement this kind of policy adjustment, many difficult political considerations {{must be taken into}} account. The number of agricultural items restricted for import in Japan was reserved at 22, in 1983. This number was the greatest among the advanced industrial countries. According to the investigation by Yujiro Hayami, the price support rate of Japanese agricultural products, which shows how much higher the Japanese prices are in comparison {{with the rest of the}} world, was inferred at 45 % in 1980. This number is regarded as almost twice the EC's and is similar to the level in Switzerland where agriculture is strongly protected in order to preserve the "Alps Agriculture". As general impression, people may think that {{agricultural protection}} policy in Japan must be adopted because the pressure of agricultural organizations on the government is so strong. Before World War II, the small textile or miscellaneous good industry which used labor intensive technology and cheaper labor was Japan's main industry for earning foreign exchange. For these small industries, the increase in food prices which would have forced a wage increase was a matter of life or death. Through the desperate resistance of these commercial and industrial concerns, even the political pressure of the agricultural organizations could not force the government to adopt agricultural protection policies. However, after World War Ii, especially during the High Economic Growth Period (from the 1950 's), the Japanese industrial structure was transformed from a labor intensive form into a capital and knowledge intensive form. Further, owing to an increase in income of its wage-earning class, the rate of food costs against the household account was reduced and the degree of closer repercussion which had brought forth previous wage increases was also gradually reduced. In such a situation, Financial Circles and consumers began to lose their ability to resist the expansion of agricultural protectionism and the increase in prices of agricultural products as a matter of life or death. Through these political and economic processes, the level of Japanese agricultural protectionism was greatly raised during its high economic growth period. By inference, using the Agricultural Price Support Rate, at the beginning of the high economic growth period (1955) the rate was 15 % and was lower then the EC's 23 %. However, 10 years later, Japan's support rate exceeded that of the EC and reached that of Switzerland's. The ultimate purpose of this paper is to assess the welfare effects of price supports in Japan. However, there exists an external factor on agricultural trade, which is the effect of foreign exchange rates. Hence, another purpose is to infer Japan's benefits from the change of foreign exchange systems. The time period for these analyses is confined mainly to 1960 through 1983, and the agricultural products to be examined are limited to two - wheat and beef. Efforts will be made to answer the questions: 1) How much has Japan benefitted from the foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>adjustments</b> through the shifting of the system from a fixed to a floating exchange rate? and 2) How much have the producers benefitted and how much of the cost of the internal program have the consumers borne over this period?Financial Economics, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

It Is also shown that the year prior to a devaluation, international reserves have been, on average, 30 % below their short-run desired level. These results are important since they indicate that not all LDC's should be aggregated for prediction purposes.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an analytical}} model {{to evaluate the}} costs and benefits of a single currency area within a unified framework, inspired by the separate arguments of Mundell (1961) and (1973).

In our model, a single currency area, as compared with a system of national currencies and floating exchange rates, brings both welfare costs associated with the absence of <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> and welfare benefits associated with risksharing. The model provides a utility-based comparison of costs versus benefits. While theoretically, either monetary regime may dominate, quantitatively, the net welfare benefits of a single currency area are likely to be negative. ...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{rationale}} {{for the doctrine of}} Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) is arbitrage in international markets for goods. This paper builds on the argument that frictions in international markets for goods limit the opportunity to exercise arbitrage, thereby creating a band of inaction around the PPP value of the real exchange rate. The existence of the band implies a discrete nonlinear real <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> process: Inside the band, where there are no arbitrage opportunities, the real exchange rate exhibits no central tendency; arbitrage activity translates into fast real <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment</b> outside the band. Applying a threshold autoregression framework that explicitly captures the notion of the band of inaction to data from two sources and at different frequencies, I estimate the width of the band and the speed of adjustment {{to the edge of the}} band for a large set of bilateral real exchange rates. I find that the width of the band is in the range of 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{influential}} work of Obstfeld and Rogoff {{argues that}} a closing-up of the US current account deficit involves a large <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment.</b> However, the Obstfeld-Rogoff model works exclusively via demand-side channels and abstracts from possible supply-side changes. We extend the framework to allow for endogenous supply-side changes and show that this fundamentally alters the mechanism of the adjustment process. Allowing for such an extension attenuates quite significantly the implied <b>exchange</b> rate <b>adjustment.</b> The paper also provides some empirical evidence of variations in the supply-side structure and correlations with the exchange rate and the current account. The policy implications are that measures to foster a supply-side reaction would facilitate the external adjustment by alleviating an exclusive reliance on demand and exchange rate changes, with the latter being potentially destabilising for the global financial system.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the {{challenges for the}} Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) {{to be an effective}} lender of last resort (LOLR) as part of a modern banking crisis resolution framework. The main results from the theoretical model of the ECCB''s institutional arrangement are that the majority of currency union members may veto emergency lending {{in the case of a}} member-specific shock, as such lending may endanger the stability of the currency board (by lowering the central bank''s international reserves, thus raising devaluation risk). However, in the presence of contagion across countries, all currency union members have a vested interest in liquidity supply from the central bank. A key policy recommendation is that currency union members need a stronger fiscal position to continue to access international financial markets and sustain the exchange rate peg.
