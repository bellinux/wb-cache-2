5|$|In the Prapancasarasara-samgraha, Dhumavati is {{described}} as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. Her dress is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. The spear is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and <b>frowning.</b> Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her breasts are dry. Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} bottom right corner, two Polish Jews are {{on the edge of}} the scene; the younger (36) one is usually {{described}} as enthralled by the events, watching them with hope, but most analysis focuses on the older man (37), whose hand is making a Sy, git ("that's good") gesture. Interpretation of this figure varies; while some suggest that he express his interest and support for the Constitution, which he sees as a promise of further reforms that will improve the situation of the Jews—the Constitution had not addressed them in any significant way—others put him, or both of the Jews, among the opponents of the Constitution, describing them as <b>frowning</b> and disturbed, gleefully anticipating the end of the Commonwealth, or at least concerned with the liberal reforms. The latter interpretation can be also supported by the fact that Matejko tended to portray Jews in his paintings in negative roles.|$|E
25|$|On 22 July, around 30 pro-government protesters {{demonstrated}} {{in front of}} the French embassy in Sofia, <b>frowning</b> upon what they saw as the French ambassador Philippe Autié's interference in Bulgaria's internal affairs due to his support for the anti-Oresharski rallies.|$|E

25|$|The {{facial nerve}} {{controls}} {{a number of}} functions, such as blinking and closing the eyes, smiling, <b>frowning,</b> lacrimation, salivation, flaring nostrils and raising eyebrows. It also carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, via the chorda tympani nerve (a branch of the facial nerve). Because of this, people with Bell's palsy may present with loss of taste sensation in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue on the affected side.|$|E
25|$|Kayak {{stanchions}} or kayak cockpit stanchions (ayapervik sg ayaperviik dual ayaperviit pl or ayaperyaraq sg ayaperyarat pl in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, ayaperwig in Cup'ig) are {{top piece}} centered at side of coaming {{and used as}} a support as one climbs out of a kayak. They prevented the person from falling while {{getting in and out}} of the kayak. All kayaks had ayaperviik on them. This one has a woman's <b>frowning</b> face with a down-turned mouth carved on it. Perhaps the other side would have a man's smiling face carved on it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} round of the 1996 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Panthers {{defeated}} the Boston Bruins in five games, then the Philadelphia Flyers in six games, to reach the Eastern Conference Finals. Then, they defeated the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games to win the Prince of Wales Trophy as the rat-tossing craze reached its peak as 3,000 rats rained onto the ice following goals. While officially <b>frowning</b> on the practice of throwing rats, the team nonetheless brought on Orkin as a sponsor and employed a crew of 40 rink attendants dressed up as exterminators to clear the ice after each Florida goal.|$|E

6000|$|A <b>frown,</b> a {{very heavy}} <b>frown,</b> came across the old woman's brow. She would have {{repressed}} it had it been possible;--but she could not command herself, and the <b>frown</b> was there. [...] "If that had been practicable, Mr. Masters," [...] she said, [...] "we should not have sent for you." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the word}} Suspect, {{she turned her}} eyes {{momentarily}} upon her son, with a dark <b>frown.</b> She then suffered them to seek the fire, as before; but with the <b>frown</b> fixed above them, as if the sculptor of old Egypt had indented it in the hard granite face, to <b>frown</b> for ages.|$|R
25|$|Koffing {{resembles a}} large, {{floating}} blue-purple ball with various gas-emitting stud-like orifices surrounding its body save for its face, which {{appears as a}} smiling mouth with two eyes, and two small white upper fangs protruding from its mouth and a skull and crossbones symbol directly below said mouth. Once a Koffing has gained enough experience points, it evolves into a Weezing. Weezing's design appears as two light-purple Koffing fused together at the side, one larger and the other smaller than normal, additionally joined by an appendage from each connecting to a smaller, spherical mass. Both faces appear to be <b>frowning,</b> with the larger featuring two lower large fangs and two upper blunted teeth. On each, the skull has been changed to simpler oval, with the smaller lacking the crossbones. Koffing is 2feet (60cm) tall, while Weezing is 3feet 11inches (119cm) tall.|$|E

500|$|Melinda Houston of The Sydney Morning Herald {{was also}} {{critical}} of the character, branding him [...] "the most ineffectual cop in Australia".

60|$|Mr. Horlock <b>frowned</b> portentously. This {{was not at}} all the way {{in which}} he should have been {{addressed}} by an unsuccessful follower. But underneath that <b>frown</b> was anxiety.|$|R

500|$|By the 19thcentury, gardens {{were created}} within the castle's enclosure. Charles Dickens lived in Rochester and {{included}} the castle ruins in The Pickwick Papers and The Mystery of Edwin Drood. Through {{the words of}} one of his characters, Dickens described the castle as a [...] "glorious pile– <b>frowning</b> wall– tottering arches– dark nooks– crumbling stones". Many of England's historic buildings, particularly ruins, have acquired myths and legends, and some are rumoured to be haunted. Rochester is no exception, and is reportedly haunted by a white lady. Dickens is also said to haunt the moat on Christmas Eve.|$|E
500|$|In March 1970, George Harrison and {{his first}} wife, Pattie Boyd, moved into their Victorian Gothic {{residence}} at Friar Park in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. The 120-room house {{was built in the}} 1890s on the site of a thirteenth-century friary by Frank Crisp, a City of London solicitor and microscopist. Harrison was immediately taken with Crisp's penchant for whimsy, the legacies of which included interior features such as doorknobs and light switches shaped as monks' faces (which meant [...] "tweaking" [...] a nose in order to turn each light on), and a carving of a monk's head that showed him smiling on one side and <b>frowning</b> on the other. A keen horticulturalist and an authority on medieval gardening, Crisp established 10 acres of formal gardens, which similarly reflected his eccentric tastes.|$|E
500|$|La Venta Monument3 stands [...] {{high and}} {{measures}} [...] wide by [...] deep; it weighs 12.8 tons. Monument3 was located a few metres {{to the east}} of Monument2, but was moved to the Parque-Museo La Venta in Villahermosa. Like the other La Venta heads, its context has been radiocarbon dated to between 1000 and 600BC. It appears unfinished and has suffered severe damage through weathering, making analysis difficult. It had a large headdress that reaches to the eyebrows but any details have been lost through erosion. Straps descend in front of each ear and continue {{to the base of the}} monument. The ears are wearing large flattened rings that overlap the straps; they probably represent jade ornaments of a type that have been recovered in the Olmec region. Although most of the facial detail is lost, the crinkling of the bridge of the nose is still evident, a feature that is common to the <b>frowning</b> expressions of the other Olmec colossal heads.|$|E
6000|$|Then {{again there}} came a black <b>frown</b> upon his brow,--a <b>frown</b> such as there had often been there of late. [...] "And will Mrs. Orme's {{presence}} make the attendance of your own son improper?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the mention}} of these two names, Mr Dorrit <b>frowned,</b> stared, <b>frowned</b> again, hesitated with his fingers at his lips, as he had hesitated long ago, and said, 'Do me the favour to--ha--state your pleasure, madam.' ...|$|R
60|$|She took Kit up {{the outside}} stairs and along a balcony to a small, hot room. Don Erminio {{occupied}} the old-fashioned bed, and when Kit came in looked {{up with a}} savage <b>frown,</b> but the <b>frown</b> vanished.|$|R
500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head3 is {{also known}} as San Lorenzo Monument3. The head {{measures}} [...] high by [...] wide by [...] deep and weighs 9.4 tons. The head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthew Stirling in 1946; it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully. The monument was found [...] southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo, however, its original location is unknown; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture. Head3 has been moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa. The headdress is complex, with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal cords, with diagonal folds above each eye. A small skullcap tops the headdress. A large flap formed of four cords drops down both sides of the head, completely covering the ears. The face has a typically <b>frowning</b> brow and, unusually, has clearly defined eyelids. The lips are thick and slightly parted; the front of the lower lip has broken away completely, and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions.|$|E

2500|$|Svetlana Khorkina {{was born}} on 19 January 1979, the {{daughter}} of Vasiliy and Lyubov. She has a younger sister, Yulia, {{who was also a}} gymnast. Khorkina said, [...] "As a child, I was very picky with my food. My mother hoped, that if she puts me into gymnastics, I would start eating breakfast without <b>frowning,</b> after having spent a lot of energy in the gym. This is how, by simple nutritional reasons, I started my gymnastics career at the age of four." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{from that}} time a change took place in their experience. Fortune seemed to <b>frown</b> from that memorable day. We say [...] "seemed," [...] because knitted brows do not always or {{necessarily}} indicate {{what is meant by}} a <b>frown.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Ann Burt Meyer of The Capital Times {{noted that}} [...] "children will clamor for this full-color cartoon book if they're {{fans of the}} show. Adult buyers may want {{to check it out}} first — because the book, like the TV show, has innuendoes for adults only." [...] Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "fans of television's most popular underachievers will enjoy Groening's The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album a {{collection}} of bizarre memorabilia that traces the clan back to their bug-eyed ancestors Sven Simpson, Claretta Ethridge, Mary <b>Frowning</b> Cloud, and Joe Puffing Goat." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{figures are}} {{positioned}} in a wave-like order of body height, with {{the orientation of}} each of the eight faces in looking in different directions. A number of scholars have remarked on their physiognomy. Their cherub faces and long, open, curly hair are similar but also show a clear intention by the artist to establish individual traits. Four angels are shown <b>frowning,</b> three have narrowed eyelids which give the appearance of peering, a trait also seen in some of the apostles in the [...] "Adoration of the Lamb". Pächt does't see Jan's hand in the rendering of their expressions, and speculates if they are remnants from Hubert's initial design.|$|E
2500|$|In {{another book}} called Rebels All, the authors sought {{to define the}} main goals of Post-War {{conservatism}} in the United States. They wrote: [...] "isn't conservatism {{supposed to be about}} maintaining standards, upholding civility, and <b>frowning</b> on rebellion?" [...] In addition, looking back at how it has evolved from after World War II to modern times, it seems undeniable that conservatism holds the capacity to defend diverging beliefs such as free-market libertarianism, religious traditionalism while valuing the aggressively suggested by the anti-communist mind. Modern Conservatism, a highly complex concept, finds its roots in the works of post-World War II thinkers and philosophers whose differing opinions about how to promote similar goals reflect the subjectivity of this political inclination.|$|E
6000|$|With {{sudden and}} desperate {{tenderness}} {{she threw her}} arms around him, and pressed his head against her bosom, little caring though his cheek rested on the scarlet letter.
