25|$|Grand jury {{proceedings}} (without {{defense counsel}} {{and without a}} judge present) in Santa Barbara, starting in March 2004, led to Jackson's indictment on April 21, 2004. The grand jury had nineteen jurors; the indictment required the votes of at least twelve jurors. Prosecution witnesses testified without defense cross-examination. The judge ruled that witnesses {{before the grand jury}} could talk to defense attorneys about their knowledge of the case as long as the witnesses did not tell what they saw <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> room or what questions they were asked and their answers. Many grand jury witnesses were sneaked into the building where the grand jury was meeting, sometimes covered in blankets to hide their identities. In February 2005 The Smoking Gun published the Grand Jury transcripts (1903 pages).|$|E
25|$|Late in August, New York {{prosecutor}} Joseph Stone {{convened a}} grand jury to investigate the allegations of the fixing of quiz shows. At {{the time of the}} empaneling, neither being a party to a fixed game show nor fixing a game show in the first place were crimes in their own right. Some witnesses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> acknowledged their role in a fixed show, while others denied it, directly contradicting one another. Many of the coached contestants, who had become celebrities due to their quiz show success, were so afraid of the social repercussions of admitting the fraud that they were unwilling to confess to having been coached, {{even to the point of}} perjuring themselves to avoid backlash. Show producers, who had legally rigged the games to increase ratings but did not want to implicate themselves, the show sponsors, or the networks they worked for in doing so, categorically denied the allegations. After the nine-month grand jury, no indictments were handed down, and the judge sealed the grand jury report in Summer 1959.|$|E
500|$|On July 3, 1986, the First Circuit Court of Appeals {{upheld the}} {{contempt}} of court fines from the Boston grand jury. That decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which let it stand. [...] The First Circuit Court heard an appeal on September 11, 1987, alleging abuse {{of the grand jury}} and denied it six days later. On November 3, 1987, six organizations affiliated with LaRouche argued that their documents were seized improperly during the October 1986 search. The court denied the appeal the following January. Jeffrey Steinberg said on December 11, 1987, that 100 notebooks compiled by himself and his wife should not have been included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> subpoena or the search. He lost that appeal the following January. The court heard an appeal from NBC on January 5, 1988, over a lower court subpoena of NBC outtakes of a videotaped interview with a witness, Forrest Lee Fick. The lower court ruled the subpoenaed outtakes were to be placed under seal and subject to in camera review only, giving the court discretion whether to release any portion to the defendants. [...] LaRouche had asserted the outtakes could be used to impeach Fick's testimony. [...] The court affirmed the lower court's ruling in March.|$|E

2500|$|After McQueary was {{identified}} as the graduate assistant who reported the 2002 incident, he was criticized for not intervening to protect the boy from Sandusky (an accusation McQueary has since disputed), {{as well as for}} not reporting the incident to police himself. On November 7, Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said that though some may have fulfilled their legal obligation to report suspected abuse, [...] "somebody has to question about what I would consider the moral requirements for a human being that knows of sexual things that are taking place with a child." [...] Noonan added that anyone who knows about suspected abuse, [...] "whether you're a football coach or a university president or the guy sweeping the building," [...] has [...] "a moral responsibility to call us." [...] Paterno said McQueary informed him that [...] "he had witnessed an incident in the shower ... but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> report." [...] Paterno was uncertain if being more graphic would have made a difference. [...] "And to be frank with you I don't know that it would have done any good, because I never heard of, of, rape and a man," [...] said Paterno.|$|E
2500|$|The {{grand jury}} is a pre-{{constitutional}} common law institution, and a constitutional fixture {{in its own right}} exclusively embracing common law. The process applies to the states {{to the extent that the}} states have incorporated grand juries and/or common law. Most states have an alternative civil process. [...] "Although state systems of criminal procedure differ greatly among themselves, the {{grand jury is}} similarly guaranteed by many state constitutions and plays an important role in fair and effective law enforcement in the overwhelming [...] majority of the States." [...] Branzburg v. Hayes (No. 70-85) 1972. Grand juries, which return indictments in many criminal cases, are composed of a jury of peers and operate in closed deliberation proceedings; they are given specific instructions regarding the law by the judge. Many constitutional restrictions that apply in court or in other situations do not apply during grand jury proceedings. For example, the exclusionary rule does not apply to certain evidence presented to a grand jury; the exclusionary rule states that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth, Fifth or Sixth amendments cannot be introduced in court. Also, an individual does not have the right to have an attorney present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> room during hearings. An individual would have such a right during questioning by the police while in custody, but an individual testifying before a grand jury is free to leave the grand jury room to consult with his attorney outside the room before returning to answer a question.|$|E
60|$|I {{have spoken}} {{something}} slightingly of the acquirements and doings of the family; and indeed their acquirements had been few and their doings little. At Allington, Dale of Allington {{had always been}} known as a king. At Guestwick, the neighbouring market town, {{he was a great}} man--to be seen frequently on Saturdays, standing in the market-place, and laying down the law as to barley and oxen among men who knew usually more about barley and oxen than did he. At Hamersham, the assize town, he was generally in some repute, being a constant grand juror for the county, and a man who paid his way. But even at Hamersham the glory of the Dales had, at most periods, begun to pale, for they had seldom been widely conspicuous in the county, and had earned no great reputation by their knowledge of jurisprudence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> room. Beyond Hamersham their fame had not spread itself.|$|E

5000|$|On December 13, 2011, Anchorage Superior Court Judge Philip Volland {{dismissed}} the murder indictment against Linehan. In his ruling, Volland wrote: The Court of Appeals repeatedly {{stated that the}} [...] "letter from the grave" [...] "appreciably affected" [...] the jury's verdict at Linehan's trial. If it did so at a trial where the evidence was contested, defense counsel present, and the jury given an even stronger limiting instruction {{on the use of}} the letter, this court cannot find that Betsy Leppink's repetition of Kent Leppink's accusatory statement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> letter was not a decisive factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> <b>jury's</b> decision to indict. Therefore, the indictment should be dismissed.|$|R
