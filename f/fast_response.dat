5|$|Cerium-doped {{lanthanum}} bromide and {{lanthanum chloride}} are the recent inorganic scintillators, {{which have a}} combination of high light yield, best energy resolution, and <b>fast</b> <b>response.</b> Their high yield converts into superior energy resolution; moreover, the light output is very stable and quite high over a very wide range of temperatures, making it particularly attractive for high-temperature applications. These scintillators are already widely used commercially in detectors of neutrons or gamma rays.|$|E

50|$|Over-excitation is used {{to achieve}} a <b>faster</b> <b>response</b> time. It’s when a coil {{momentarily}} receives a higher voltage than its nominal rating. To be effective the over excitation voltage must be significantly, {{but not to the}} point of diminishing returns, higher than the normal coil voltage. Three times the voltage typically gives around ⅓ <b>faster</b> <b>response.</b> Fifteen times the normal coil voltage will produce a 3 times <b>faster</b> <b>response</b> time. For example, a clutch coil that was rated for 6 V would need to put in 90 V to achieve the 3 times factor.|$|R

5|$|In April 1916 a German battlecruiser {{squadron}} with accompanying cruisers and destroyers bombarded {{the coastal}} ports of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Although the ports had some military importance, the main {{aim of the}} raid was to entice out defending ships which could then be picked off either by the battlecruiser squadron or by the full High Seas Fleet, which was stationed at sea ready to intervene if an opportunity presented itself. The result was inconclusive: nearby Royal Navy units were too small to intervene so largely kept clear of the German battlecruisers, and the German ships withdrew before the first British <b>fast</b> <b>response</b> battlecruiser squadron or the Grand Fleet could arrive.|$|E

40|$|We investigated, in a {{university}} student population, spontaneous (non-speeded) fast and slow number-to-line mapping responses using non-symbolic (dots) and symbolic (words) stimuli. Seeking for less conventionalized responses, we used anchors 0 – 130, rather than the standard 0 – 100. Slow responses to both types of stimuli only produced linear mappings with no evidence of non-linear compression. In contrast, <b>fast</b> <b>responses</b> revealed distinct patterns of non-linear compression for dots and words. A predicted logarithmic compression was observed in <b>fast</b> <b>responses</b> to dots in the 0 – 130 range, {{but not in the}} reduced 0 – 100 range, indicating compression in proximity of the upper anchor 130, not the standard 100. Moreover, <b>fast</b> <b>responses</b> to words revealed an unexpected significant negative compres-sion in the reduced 0 – 100 range, but not in the 0 – 130 range, indicating compression in proximity to the lower anchor 0. Results show that <b>fast</b> <b>responses</b> help revealing the funda-mentally distinct nature of symbolic and non-symbolic quantity representation. Whole num-ber words, being intrinsically mediated by cultural phenomena such as language and education, emphasize the invariance of magnitude between them—essential for linear map-pings, and therefore, unlike non-symbolic (psychophysical) stimuli, yield spatial mappings that don’t seem to be influenced by the Weber-Fechner law of psychophysics. However, high levels of education (when combined with an absence of standard upper anchors) may lead <b>fast</b> <b>responses</b> to overestimate magnitude invariance on the lower end of word numerals...|$|R

50|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that the IAT may measure {{salience}} of concepts rather than associations. Whereas IAT proponents claim that <b>faster</b> <b>response</b> times when pairing concepts indicate stronger associations, critics claim that <b>faster</b> <b>response</b> times indicate that concepts are similar in salience (and slower response times indicate that concepts differ in salience). There is some support for this claim. For example, in an old-young IAT, old faces would be more salient than young faces. As a result, researchers created an old-young IAT that involved pairing young and old faces with neutral words (non-salient attribute) and non-words (salient attribute). <b>Response</b> times were <b>faster</b> when old faces (salient) were paired with non-words (salient) than when old faces (salient) were paired with neutral words (non-salient), supporting the assertion that <b>faster</b> <b>response</b> time can be facilitated by matching salience.|$|R

30|$|We {{conducted}} an experiment {{to get the}} response of the mixed gas consisting of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating gases.

Previous studies reported individual detection of CO [6 – 8, 20] and NH 3 [14], where these sensors were using C-SWCNT bundle sensing layer, accordingly. As well as introducing mixture-gas detection capability, the C-SWCNT sensor fabricated in our study was more responsive even for individual detection, see Figures 3 and 4.|$|R

25|$|Due to spin-orbit coupling, undoped GaAs {{single crystal}} {{exhibits}} much larger Faraday rotation than glass (SiO2). Considering the atomic arrangement is different along the (100) and (110) plane, {{one might think}} the Faraday rotation is polarization dependent. However, experimental work revealed an immeasurable anisotropy in the wavelength range from 880–1,600nm. Based on the large Faraday rotation, one {{might be able to}} use GaAs to calibrate the B field of the terahertz electromagnetic wave which requires very <b>fast</b> <b>response</b> time. Around the band gap, the Faraday effect shows resonance behavior.|$|E

25|$|The ocelli {{of insects}} bear a simple lens, but their focal point always lies behind the retina; {{consequently}} {{they can never}} form a sharp image. Ocelli (pit-type eyes of arthropods) blur the image across the whole retina, and are consequently excellent at responding to rapid changes in light intensity across the whole visual field; this <b>fast</b> <b>response</b> is further accelerated by the large nerve bundles which rush {{the information to the}} brain. Focusing the image would also cause the sun's image to be focused on a few receptors, with the possibility of damage under the intense light; shielding the receptors would block out some light and thus reduce their sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a number}} of {{challenges}} for Raman amplifiers prevented their earlier adoption. First, compared to the EDFAs, Raman amplifiers have relatively poor pumping efficiency at lower signal powers. Although a disadvantage, this lack of pump efficiency also makes gain clamping easier in Raman amplifiers. Second, Raman amplifiers require a longer gain fiber. However, this disadvantage can be mitigated by combining gain and the dispersion compensation in a single fiber. A third disadvantage of Raman amplifiers is a <b>fast</b> <b>response</b> time, which gives rise to new sources of noise, as further discussed below. Finally, there are concerns of nonlinear penalty in the amplifier for the WDM signal channels.|$|E

The cost of security increased from £282million to £553million, and the figure of 13,500 armed forces personnel was more than Britain currently had deployed in Afghanistan.

25|$|Response time: OLEDs {{also have}} a much faster {{response}} time than an LCD. Using response time compensation technologies, the fastest modern LCDs can reach response times as low as 1 ms for their fastest color transition, and are capable of refresh frequencies as high as 240nbsp&Hz. According to LG, OLED response times are up to 1,000 times faster than LCD, putting conservative estimates at under 10 μs (0.01 ms), which could theoretically accommodate refresh frequencies approaching 100nbsp&kHz (100,000nbsp&Hz). Due to their extremely <b>fast</b> <b>response</b> time, OLED displays can also be easily designed to be strobed, creating an effect similar to CRT flicker {{in order to avoid}} the sample-and-hold behavior seen on both LCDs and some OLED displays, which creates the perception of motion blur.|$|E
