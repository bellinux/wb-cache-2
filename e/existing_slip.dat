40|$|The {{geological}} {{structures and}} hydrological conditions are extremely complicated at landslide area {{and it is}} difficult to evaluate the groundwater seepage behavior and the associated stability problems of an exsiting slip surface during rainfall by employing simplified conventional analysis method. This study performed two dimensional finite element seepage and deformation analyses on the <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surface along the A-A profile of Lu-Shan Landslide during torrential rainfall of Matsa Typhoon in 2005. At the mean time, incorporating with the limit equilibrium analysis the corresponding stability of the <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surface at each time step can be evaluated. Thruough the aforementioned analyses, the variations of groundwater level, pore water pressure, factor of safety and displacement rate of the <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surface at each time step of a real time rainfall can be obtained. The reliability and validity of the proposed numerical model was verified by comparing the numerical results of groundwater variation and displacement rate of the <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surface along the A-A profile of Lu-Shan Landslide with those from measurements. In addition, a set of optimum numerical parmeters of alluvium which encompassed saturated hydraulic conductivity, saturated volumetric water content for seepage analyses and Youngs modulus, friction angle, cohesion, Poissions ratio and total unit weight for displacement analyses were determined by the optimization back analysis procedure of objective function. Based on the objective function of optimization back analysis, it was found that the variation of groundwater level in seepage analyses is most sensitive to the saturated hydraulic conductivity value of alluvium and secondly followed by the saturated volumetric water content value. On the other hand, the displacement variation of soil mass is most sensitive to the Youngs modulus value in displacement analysis of rainwater infiltration, then followed by the Poissions ratio and friction angle values, whereas it is less sensitive to the total unit weight and cohesion values. Through the time-dependent slope stability analyses during rainfall, it was found that the factor safety of the <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surface F(t) along the A-A profile of Lu-Shan Landslide will descend as the groundwater level uplifts and which alternately implies an increase of pore water pressure on the <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surface. On the contrary, the numerical results show a tendency of the recovery of the descended F(t) value when the groundwater level is drawdown and the pore water pressure on slip surface is decreasing. Eventually, a predictive equation (or v(t) ~F(t) equation) for displacement rate v(t) from factor of safety F(t) can be derived by a regression analysis. The predictive equation is capable of predicting the immediate displacement rate v(t) of the slope according to the factor of safety F(t) at each timestep t during rainfall. In such manner, the displacement rate of the exsiting slip surface of Lu-Shan Landslide can be immediately evaluated and used as a quantitative reference for landslide warning system. 地滑區之地質構造與水文條件十分複雜，採用簡化之傳統分析方法並無法評估地滑區在降雨期間之地下滲流狀態及其伴隨之穏定性問題。黎明工程顧問有限公司於廬山地滑區歷經 3 年之調查工作，對地滑區之地質構造分布及滑動監測資料皆建立有完整的資料庫。根據調查成果，本研究採用廬山 2005 年馬莎颱風降雨及地質資料，針對廬山地滑區之A-A 剖面邊坡，進行二維有限元素滲流及位移數值分析。同時，在降雨期間配合極限平衡分析法，檢核其相應之穩定性。由分析結果可求得降雨歷時中每一時間階，地滑區邊坡之地下水水位、孔隙水壓力、安全係數及位移量變化。 本文所提出數值分析模式之可靠性及有效性，可藉由廬山地滑區A-A剖面邊坡之監測資料(地下水水位及位移量) 與數值分析結果之比對來獲得確認。另外，透過數值參數反算分析及最佳化程序可決定地表崩積層材料一組滲流分析最適參數輸入值(即飽和水力傳導係數、飽和體積含水量) 以及位移分析最適參數輸入值(即楊氏模數、內摩擦角、凝聚力、柏松比及單位體積重) 。 在廬山地滑區數值參數反算分析及最佳化程序中透過最小平方差法計算可發現，在降雨滲流分析時，地下水水位變化對地表崩積層材料之飽和水力傳導係數最敏感，而飽和體積含水量次之。此外，在降雨位移分析時，位移量變化對楊氏模數最敏感，其次柏松比與內摩擦角為局部敏感，而單位體積重及凝聚力較不敏感。 藉由邊坡穩定分析結果與孔隙水壓uw之相關性，可瞭解已知滑動面之穩定性安全係數F在地下水水位上升(即已知滑動面上之孔隙水壓uw增加) 時，將導致F值下降。反之，當地下水水位下降(即已知滑動面上之孔隙水壓uw減少) 時，F值則有回升之趨勢。 另外，由馬莎颱風期間之降雨滲流分析結果得知，B 01 監測管、B 06 監測管及B 09 監測管點位之未飽和崩積層之體積含水量有隨降雨量增加而上升之趨勢。同時可發現，崩積層之飽和度則由地表之未飽和狀態而往下深度處漸漸趨於飽和狀態。 最後，依據廬山地滑區在馬莎颱風期間之地下水水位、位移率及穩定性安全係數之串聯式分析程序，吾人可建置颱風降雨期間，地滑區邊坡之穩定性安全係數~降雨延時函數(或F(t) ~t函數) 及位移率~降雨延時函數(或v(t) ~t函數) 。隨之，經由迴歸分析即可決定，邊坡在降雨期間之位移率函數與穩定性安全係數函數之關係式 (或v(t) ~F(t) 關係式) 。此關係式可在任一降雨延時t及已知邊坡穩定性安全係數F(t) 之條件下，用以推求所對應之邊坡即時位移率v(t) ，並作為地滑區警戒系統在發布警戒訊息時之量化參考依據。誌 謝	I 摘 要	II ABSTRACT	IV 目 錄	VI 表 目 錄	VIII 圖 目 錄	IX 1. 1 研究動機	 1 1. 2 研究目的	 1 1. 3 研究範圍	 1 第二章 文獻回顧	 3 2. 1 地滑	 3 2. 1. 1 定義	 3 2. 1. 2 地滑型態之分類	 5 2. 1. 3 地滑之影響因子	 10 2. 2 降雨誘發地滑	 14 2. 2. 1 降雨對地下水位之影響	 14 2. 2. 2 降雨入滲與邊坡穩定相關研究	 16 2. 3 土壤滲流模式	 18 2. 3. 1 Green-Ampt入滲模型	 18 2. 3. 2 水力傳導係數函數	 19 2. 3. 3 體積含水量函數之量測方法	 23 2. 4 數值分析之反算	 31 2. 4. 1 數值參數與實驗室參數	 31 2. 4. 2 最小平方差法	 31 2. 4. 3 參數敏感度	 32 2. 5 地滑災害數值分析相關文獻	 34 第三章 數值分析程式	 35 3. 1 滲流分析程式SEEP/W	 35 3. 1. 1 程式簡介	 35 3. 1. 2 滲流分析理論	 35 3. 2 邊坡穩定分析程式SLOPE/W	 38 3. 2. 1 程式簡介	 38 3. 2. 2 邊坡穩定分析理論	 38 3. 3 位移分析程式SIGMA/W	 42 3. 3. 1 程式簡介	 42 3. 3. 2 變形分析理論	 42 3. 3. 3 變形與孔隙水壓力消長耦合分析	 42 3. 3. 4 不飽和土壤模數(unsaturated soil modulus，H) 	 45 第四章 研究方法	 47 4. 1 研究流程	 47 4. 2 廬山地滑區現場調查相關資料彙整	 49 4. 2. 1 位置與地形	 49 4. 2. 2 地質概況	 51 4. 2. 3 雨量資料	 52 4. 2. 4 地層調查及鑽探成果	 53 4. 2. 5 監測站資料	 59 4. 2. 6 滑動機制分析	 60 4. 3 廬山地滑區數值分析	 60 4. 3. 1 幾何模式	 60 4. 3. 2 初始條件	 61 4. 3. 3 邊界條件	 61 4. 3. 4 輸入參數	 62 4. 3. 5 分析執行	 63 4. 4 數值參數反算分析及最佳化程序	 65 4. 4. 1 崩積層材料參數	 66 4. 4. 2 監測資料(hw =hw(t) 及δ =δ(t)) 	 67 4. 4. 3 目標函數計算及參數敏感度分析	 68 第五章 結果與討論	 70 5. 1 廬山地滑區降雨滲流及位移之數值參數反算分析及最佳化程序	 70 5. 1. 1 參數敏感度分析	 70 5. 1. 2 最佳化參數	 73 5. 2 廬山地滑區降雨滲流及位移分析比對	 74 5. 2. 1 降雨滲流分析比對	 74 5. 2. 2 位移分析比對	 75 5. 3 廬山地滑區孔隙水壓與已知滑動面穩定性安全係數之關係	 80 5. 4 廬山地滑區降雨期間體積含水量之變化	 84 5. 5 廬山地滑區降雨期間位移率與穩定性安全係數之關係函數推導	 87 第六章 結論與建議	 88 6. 1 結論	 88 6. 1. 1 廬山地滑區降雨滲流及位移反算分析	 88 6. 1. 2 廬山地滑區降雨滲流及位移分析比對	 89 6. 1. 3 廬山地滑區孔隙水壓與已知滑動面穩定性安全係數之關係	 89 6. 1. 4 廬山地滑區降雨期間體積含水量之變化	 90 6. 1. 5 廬山地滑區降雨期間位移率與穩定性安全係數之關係函數	 90 6. 2 建議	 90 參考文獻	 91 附錄 A	 95 附錄 B	 97 附錄 C	 98 附錄 D	 100 附錄 E	 10...|$|E

40|$|Stiff intact clays exhibit rapid loss of {{strength}} after failure, with {{the formation of}} slip surfaces {{and the development of a}} well-defined 'post-rupture' strength envelope. This paper describes an experimental study of the influence of a number of factors on the post-rupture strength of initially intact samples of Vallericca Clay. These include changes in confining pressure after the formation of a slip surface, the magnitude of the relative displacement across the surface, comparison between the post-rupture strength envelopes in triaxial compression and extension, and the influence of <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surfaces on the formation and strength of subsequent rupture planes formed by rotation of the principal stresses. The results show that the post-rupture strength envelope is well defined, repeatable, and not very sensitive to stress history or the rotation of the principal stresses. Little reduction in shearing resistance takes place for relative displacements up to about 10 mm. The results are believed to be of significance in understanding the formation of fissures in stiff clays, and in evaluating their operational strength...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the frame}} of the 'CRL' (Corinth Rift Laboratory project) (Cornet et al, 2004 a) {{centered}} on the south western sector of the Gulf of Corinth ([URL] fault zone cores from the active Aigion fault have been collected continuously from depths between 708 m to 782 m. Inside this clayey core, a clear shearing surface with marked slip lines is visible on a plane that makes a 68 degree angle with respect to the core axis. This failure surface was not induced by the decompression process but is indeed a slip plane as clear striation is observed at the interface. On the basis of an elastoplastic constitutive model calibrated on triaxial tests on the clayey gouge, it is shown that shear band formation inside the clayey core is possible. The solution for the orientation of the shear band is compared to the orientation of an <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surface inside the clayey gouge and this result is used to deduce the orientation of the principal stresses. It is shown that as commonly observed in weak fault zones, the orientation of the principal stresses is locally almost parallel and perpendicular to the fault axis...|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} is proposed to characterize and forecast the displacement trends of slow-moving landslides, {{defined as the}} reactivation stage of phenomena in rocks or fine-grained soils, with movements localized along one or several existing shear surfaces. The {{framework is}} developed based on a thorough analysis of the scientific literature and with reference to significant reported case studies for which a consistent dataset of continuous displacement measurements is available. Three distinct trends of movement are defined to characterize the kinematic behavior of the active stages of slow-moving landslides in a velocity-time plot: a linear trend-type I, which is appropriate for stationary phenomena; a convex shaped trend-type II, which is associated with rapid increases in pore water pressure due to rainfall, followed by a slow decrease in the groundwater level with time; and a concave shaped trend-type III, which denotes a non-stationary process related {{to the presence of}} new boundary conditions such as those associated with the development of a newly formed local slip surface that connects with the main <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surface.

40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{experimental}} study of air-water mixtures flowing through idealized shell and tube, in-line and staggered heat exchangers. The measured void fractions in the maximum and minimum gaps between the tubes are reported at near atmospheric conditions, to give local variations for different tube diameters and tube bundle arrangements. The void fraction measurements were made using a gamma-ray densitometer. The pressure drops in the tube bundles are also reported. These data are compared with the correlations available in the open literatures to investigate the void fraction and pressure drop prediction methods for these heat exchangers. The in-line 38 mm tube bundle is shown to provide no significant effect on void fraction or drag force {{when compared with the}} 20 mm tube diameter bundle. A new void fraction model is therefore proposed by modifying the characteristic length of an <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> ratio method. A new pressure drop model is presented. The acceleration pressure drop between the tubes from the separation to re-attachment is shown to be responsible for some of the frictional pressure drop with a liquid film on the tubes responsible for the remainder.

40|$|AbstractProbabilistic slope {{stability}} analysis typically requires an optimisation technique {{to locate the}} most probable slip surface. However, for many slopes particularly those containing many different soil layers or benches several distinct critical slip surfaces may exist. Furthermore, in large slopes these critical slip surfaces may be located at significant distances from each other. In such circumstances, finding and rehabilitating the most probable failure surface is of little merit, as rehabilitating that surface does not improve {{the safety of the}} slope as a whole. Unfortunately, <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surface search techniques were developed to converge on one global minimum. Therefore, to implement such methods to evaluate the stability of a slope with multiple failure mechanisms requires the user to define probable slip locations prior to calculation. This requires extensive engineering experience and places undue responsibility on the engineer in question. This paper proposes the use of a locally informed particle swarm optimisation method which is able to simultaneously converge to multiple critical slip surfaces. This optimisation model when combined with a reliability analysis is able to define all areas of concern within a slope. A case study of a railway slope is presented which highlights the benefits of the model over single objective optimisation models. The approach is of particular benefit when evaluating the stability of large existing slopes with complicated stratigraphy as these slopes are likely to contain multiple viable slip surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Layer-bound, low-displacement normal faults, {{arranged}} into {{a broadly}} polygonal pattern, {{are common in}} many sedimentary basins. Despite having constrained their gross geometry, we have a relatively poor understanding of the processes controlling the nucleation and growth (i. e., the kinematics) of polygonal fault systems. In this study we use high-resolution 3 -D seismic reflection and borehole data from the northern North Sea to undertake a detailed kinematic analysis of faults forming part of a seismically well-imaged polygonal fault system hosted within the up to 1, 000 m thick, Early Palaeocene-to-Middle Miocene mudstones of the Hordaland Group. Growth strata and displacement-depth profiles indicate faulting commenced during the Eocene to early Oligocene, with reactivation possibly occurring in the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. Mapping the position of displacement maxima on 137 polygonal faults suggests that the majority (64 %) nucleated in the lower 500 m of the Hordaland Group. The uniform distribution of polygonal fault strikes in the area indicates that nucleation and growth were not driven by gravity or far-field tectonic extension as has previously been suggested. Instead, fault growth was likely facilitated by low coefficients of residual friction on <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> surfaces, and probably involved significant layer-parallel contraction (strains of 0. 01 – 0. 19) of the host strata.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is the development of an analytical model for predicting the response under reversed cyclic loading of structural members with ‘old-type’ detailing, strengthened with reinforced concrete (RC) jacketing. The analytical model introduces one additional degree of freedom between the existing member (core of the retrofitted member) and its outer RC shell, thus allowing slip to take place at the interface between the existing member and the jacket. Shear resistance mechanisms, such as aggregate interlock, friction, and dowel action, are mobilized to resist <b>slip.</b> <b>Existing</b> constitutive models are further improved to describe the mechanisms that resist sliding under cyclic shear reversals and implemented {{for the first time in}} an analytical model for deriving the response of RC jacketed members. A calculation algorithm is developed to estimate the flexural response under cyclic loading taking into account slip at the interfaces. The sensitivity of the proposed analytical model to the shear transfer mechanisms degradation rules, as well as to the crack spacing estimation, was evaluated. The validity of the proposed analytical model is assessed against experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Upcoming {{emissions}} regulations (Tiers 3, 4 a and 4 b) are imposing {{significantly higher}} heat loads on the cooling system than lesser regulated machines. This work was {{a suite of}} tasks aimed at reducing the parasitic losses of the cooling system, or improving the design process through six distinct tasks: 1. Develop an axial fan that will provide more airflow, with less input power and less noise. The initial plan was to use Genetic Algorithms to do an automated fan design, incorporating forward sweep for low noise. First and second generation concepts could not meet either performance or sound goals. An experienced turbomachinery designer, using a specialized CFD analysis program {{has taken over the}} design and has been able to demonstrate a 5 % flow improvement (vs 10 % goal) and 10 % efficiency improvement (vs 10 % goal) using blade twist only. 2. Fan shroud developments, using an 'aeroshroud' concept developed at Michigan State University. Performance testing at Michigan State University showed the design is capable of meeting the goal of a 10 % increase in flow, but over a very narrow operating range of fan performance. The goal of 10 % increase in fan efficiency was not met. Fan noise was reduced from 0 to 2 dB, vs. a goal of 5 dB at constant airflow. The narrow range of fan operating conditions affected by the aeroshroud makes this concept unattractive for further development at this time 3. Improved axial fan system modeling is needed to accommodate the numbers of cooling systems to be redesigned to meet lower emissions requirements. A CFD fan system modeling guide has been completed and transferred to design engineers. Current, uncontrolled modeling practices produce flow estimates in some cases within 5 % of measured values, and in some cases within 25 % of measured values. The techniques in the modeling guide reduced variability to the goal of + 5 % for the case under study. 4. Demonstrate the performance and design versatility of a high performance fan. A 'swept blade mixed flow' fan was rapid prototyped from cast aluminum for a performance demonstration on a small construction machine. The fan was mounted directly in place of the conventional fan (relatively close to the engine). The goal was to provide equal airflow at constant fan speed, with 75 % of the input power and 5 dB quieter than the conventional fan. The result was a significant loss in flow with the prototype due to its sensitivity to downstream blockage. This sensitivity to downstream blockage affects flow, efficiency, and noise all negatively, and further development was terminated. 5. Develop a high efficiency variable speed fan drive to replace <b>existing</b> <b>slipping</b> clutch style fan drives. The goal for this task was to provide a continuously variable speed fan drive with an efficiency of 95 %+ at max speed, and losses no greater than at max speed as the fan speed would vary throughout its entire speed range. The process developed to quantify the fuel savings potential of a variable speed fan drive has produced a simple tool to predict the fuel savings of a variable speed drive, and has sparked significant interest in the use of variable speed fan drive for Tier 3 emissions compliant machines. The proposed dual ratio slipping clutch variable speed fan drive can provide a more efficient system than a conventional single ratio slipping clutch fan drive, but could not meet the established performance goals of this task, so this task was halted in a gate review {{prior to the start of}} detailed design. 6. Develop a cooling system air filtration device to allow the use of automotive style high performance heat exchangers currently in off road machines. The goal of this task was to provide a radiator air filtration system that could allow high fin density, louvered radiators to operate in a find dust application with the same resistance to fouling as a current production off-road radiator design. Initial sensitivity testing demonstrated that fan speed has a significant impact on the fouling of radiator cores due to fine dusts, so machines equipped with continuously variable speed fan drives would be expected to have more radiator debris fouling problems than a machine with a constant speed fan. Filtration concepts looked at a wide range of filtration technologies, but the combination of pressure drop constraints and the small size of the debris to be filtered made this a futile exercise. The most successful technologies evaluated all incorporate some way to increase the Reynolds number inside the heat exchanger air flow path. A form of an 'air knife' concept has emerged as the most promising technology to pursue...|$|R
40|$|Structures with contact {{interfaces}} show a non-linear behaviour with {{predominance of}} local energy dissipation {{in comparison to}} inherent material damping losses. This paper implements an equivalent local discrete spring-damper system at the contact interface based on generalized Hertz and Mindlin contact models for the definition of contact stiffness, with the motivation of capturing the major non-linear effects of predominant structural modes. In contrast to many time domain methods, the present model is implemented in the frequency domain to enable advantages of easy modelling and reduced computational time for various practical applications. A double layered beam with four bolted joints is used as base model for test and validation of the contact model. A pressure dependent joint model is illustrated in this paper to obtain the equivalent contact stiffness in normal and tangential directions. For excitations provoking tangential relative motion, the region of micro <b>slip</b> <b>existing</b> between the stick and sliding region is idealized for maximum damping. The structure's dynamic behaviour is quantitatively studied for a variation of bolt pretension (variation in contact pressure). A quantitative model verification and parameter study of the base model has been done {{with a set of}} experiments. Results have shown a good match for both eigenfrequency and modal damping between simulation and experiment. It can be concluded for the present contact model, that the model shows good convergence with experimental investigations and thus can be used for lightly damped non-linear systems at very efficient computational times...|$|R
40|$|Regularization is {{a routine}} {{approach}} used in earthquake slip distribution inversion to avoid numerically abnormal solutions. To date, most slip inversion studies have imposed uniform regularization {{on all the}} fault patches. However, adaptive regularization, where each retrieved parameter is regularized differently, has exhibited better performances in other research fields such as image restoration. In this paper, we implement an investigation into adaptive regularization for earthquake slip distribution inversion. It is found that adaptive regularization can achieve a significantly smaller mean square error (MSE) than uniform regularization, if it is set properly. We propose an adaptive regularization method based on weighted total least squares (WTLS). This approach assumes that errors exist in both the regularization matrix and observation, and an iterative algorithm is used to solve the solution. A weight coefficient is used to balance the regularization matrix residual and the observation residual. An experiment using four slip patterns was carried out to validate the proposed method. The {{results show that the}} proposed regularization method can derive a smaller MSE than uniform regularization and resolution-based adaptive regularization, and the improvement in MSE is more significant for slip patterns with low-resolution slip patches. In this paper, we apply the proposed regularization method to study the slip distribution of the 2011 Mw 9. 0 Tohoku earthquake. The retrieved slip distribution is less smooth and more detailed than the one retrieved with the uniform regularization method, and is closer to the <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> model from joint inversion of the geodetic and seismic data.

40|$|Investigation of {{earthquake}} source parameters {{is important}} for {{better understanding of the}} physics behind earthquakes, which is essential for mitigating the hazards of destructive earthquakes. This dissertation explores several different aspects of source parameter estimation. First, I image the rupture process of the 2004 M 6. 0 Parkfield earthquake in three dimensions using a waveform back-projection method. I identify a distinct secondary high-frequency phase that radiated from a point about 13 km northwest of the hypocenter. Together with <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> model inversions of the Parkfield earthquake, these results constrain several physical properties of the rupture process. Second, I use an iterative least-squares approach on both local and global seismic data to isolate source spectra from attenuation and near-station site effects and apply an empirical Green's function correction for near-source attenuation. Brune-type stress drop estimates for small earthquakes in the Parkfield area and for moderate to large earthquakes worldwide range from 0. 1 to 50 MPa, with robust lateral variations in average stress drop. In Parkfield some of these variations change temporally after the 2004 M 6. 0 Parkfield earthquake. On a global scale, the stress drop variations are usually confined to specific plate boundaries or tectonic regimes. The highest average stress drops occur for oceanic transform fault earthquakes and other strike-slip events. Intraplate events have a factor of two higher average stress drops than interplate events. Stress drops of both small earthquakes in Parkfield and larger global earthquakes show no dependence on moment. Our stress-drop estimates, combined with other published results, provide strong evidence that earthquakes exhibit self-similarity over most of the instrumentally observable magnitude range. Finally, using the spectral separation method to discriminate between natural seismicity and man-made explosions, I find that the best single waveform discriminant for data recorded in southern California is the RMS-misfit between quarry blast spectra and an w- 2 source mode...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} several distinct studies that use numerical modeling to better constrain deformation due to faulting over disparate timescales. ^ Field mapping reveals {{a segment of}} the Lake Mead fault system, the Pinto Ridge fault, and a cluster of west-dipping normal faults located near Pinto Ridge. I suggest that this strike-slip segment was kinematically related to the Bitter Spring Valley fault, created the normal fault cluster at Pinto Ridge, and utilized these normal faults as linking structures between fault segments. Modeling results demonstrate that the location and orientations of the normal faults are consistent with having formed in the perturbed stress field around the slipping Pinto Ridge fault. Calculations of mechanical efficiency suggest that a preferred dip of normal faults in the region may reflect a crustal anisotropy at depth, such as a detachment. ^ I present a methodology for simulating interseismic deformation in complex regions. I derive an analytical model of interseismic deformation that is equivalent to the conventional model. Based on this model, I formulate a two-step numerical simulation of geologic and interseismic deformation. I apply this technique to the Los Angeles region and find that model results match well both geologic slip rate estimates and geodetic velocities. Model results suggest that the Puente Hills thrusts are currently slipping at rates that are compatible with geologic estimates and that localized contraction in the San Gabriel basin is dominantly due to deep slip on the Sierra Madre fault. ^ To assess the control of fault geometry and mechanical interactions on fault slip in a natural system, I create models of the Ventura region, California, using both planar and non-planar faults. I find that incorporating geologically-constrained fault surfaces into numerical models results in a better match to available geologic slip rate data than models utilizing planar faults. Because slip rates at most locations along the surface traces of Ventura faults are not likely to represent average values for the entire fault surface, I propose that well-constrained models can be used to predict slip rates at specific locations and determine whether <b>existing</b> <b>slip</b> rate estimates are representative of average fault slip rates. ...|$|E
40|$|At {{high flow}} rates during polymer melt extrusion, {{pressure}} oscillations can be observed. The phenomenon is usually {{referred to as}} spurt, due to the irregular—in bursts—emergence of the melt out of the die. Spurt, or equivalently, the associated pressure oscillations have been modelled successfully through the mechanism of relaxation-oscillations by Molenaar and Koopmans. The presence of a non-monotone flow curve {{is at the heart}} of this modelling. In this paper the curve is deduced from conservation laws combined with a die wall boundary condition and specific constitutive equations. Subsequently, three ‘model curves' are compared. Model A, a Newtonian fluid with a ‘switch function' defining an alternating stick-slip boundary condition. Model B is a non-monotone constitutive equation i. e. a Johnson-Segalman-Oldroyd (JSO) fluid with a no-slip condition. Model C consists of two Newtonian fluids in concentric die regions and a no-slip condition. It is shown that Models A and C are able to describe spurt that is in qualitative agreement with experiments reported in literature. Model B, however, does not lead to spurt, in spite of the non-monotone nature of the steady stress–strain rate curve! These results tend to show that there are many options to describe experimental flow curves with equations based on geometrical, operational and polymer property parameters. Accordingly, from a mathematical point of view, and in view of the equivalence in results between model A and C, it can be concluded that the <b>existing</b> controversy between <b>slip</b> or no-slip (i. e. constitutive) supporters is not a fundamental one...|$|R
40|$|Computational Infrastructure and Informatics Poster SessionBackground: The {{most common}} reason why {{clinical}} trials fail {{is that they}} fall well below their goals for patient accrual. Researchers will frequently overpromise and underdeliver {{on the number of}} patients that they can recruit during the proposed time frame. The result is studies that take far longer than planned and/or that end with fewer patients than planned. This raises serious economic and ethical issues. Our research efforts have focused on (1) getting reliable data on the scope and magnitude of problems with slow patient accrual in clinical trials, and (2) developing a Bayesian model for accrual that will encourage careful planning of accrual rates as well as allow regular monitoring of accrual patterns during the conduct of the clinical trial. Methods: A random sample of 130 prospective studies approved by the Children's Mercy Hospital (CMH) IRB from 2001 through 2005 were retrospectively reviewed for the proposed and actual accrual rates. At the same time, a Bayesian model for accrual was developed and applied to a clinical trial at Kansas University Medical Center to produce monthly reports projecting estimated final sample sizes with uncertainty limits given the initial projection and currently available enrolment data. Results: 117 (90 %) of the studies submitted to the IRB did not specify a start date, a completion date, or both, making it impossible to assess the accrual rate. Of the remaining studies, two failed to list actual start or end dates. Of the remaining 11 studies, 8 took more time than proposed and the average increase in duration in these 8 studies was 100 %. Among the 109 studies that included both a target and an actual sample size, 59 (54 %) fell short of the proposed sample size. The average shortfall across these 59 studies was 55 %. The informative prior used in the Bayesian model was reasonable and produced early estimates of total sample size that were an accurate reflection of the end result. Conclusions: A large number of studies failed to meet the specified sample sizes and the average shortfall among these studies was considerable. The Bayesian model for accrual produced useful reports for a particular study and provided reassurance to the researchers that their accrual rates were on target. The Bayesian model, however, also has the capability of correcting an inaccurate prior distribution as the accumulated accrual patterns provide contradictory results. Future research should focus on collaborations with organizations that conduct large numbers of clinical trials to get more data on <b>existing</b> problems with <b>slipped</b> deadlines and sample size shortfalls and to test the Bayesian accrual model {{on a wide range of}} clinical trials...|$|R
40|$|To {{mitigate}} the increasing atmospheric CO 2 level {{and reduce the}} subsequent impacts, storage of CO 2 is one option that might become necessary. Ocean storage and storage of CO 2 under the sea bottom with potential leakage into the ocean both require knowledge of the behaviour of CO 2 drops in seawater. An analysis of the dissolution and velocity of a single CO 2 drop rising from 800 m depth is made. The drop is simulated by a numerical model and theory is compared to data from an ocean experiment performed in Monterey bay, California. Single CO 2 drops were there released at 800 m and imaged under hydrate forming conditions. The slip velocity of a hydrate-covered drop has been suggested to correspond to the drag of a spherical rigid particle. However, a clear discrepancy between this theory and the ocean observations is shown. Some possible explanations for this deviation are found. An <b>existing</b> parameterisation for <b>slip</b> velocity accounting for change of shape fits the observed drop velocity reasonably well. That deformation {{must be taken into}} account in the calculations of drop terminal velocities is confirmed by similar studies. Hydrate is expected to reduce the mass transfer. Common theory with a reduction factor of 2 matches the observed dissolution rate. This is compatible with laboratory results. A main reason for studying mass transfer and drop velocity is to get increased knowledge about the distribution of dissolved CO 2 in the water column. The effects of varying initial drop size, release depth and theories of dynamics and dissolution on the vertical distribution of dissolved CO 2 are studied. When deformation is not included in the calculations of drop terminal velocities, an overestimation of the vertical spread of dissolved CO 2 might be made. Releasing CO 2 near the critical depth leads to a narrower vertical range of dissolved CO 2, making release depth an important factor influencing the vertical spread in the ocean. To study statistical probability distributions of drops, a database with information about the mass loss of numerous drops having different initial drop sizes was generated. A simple Matlab program was then developed to extract data from the database and provide different probability distributions. Normal and lognormal distributions were studied with varying standard deviations. Comparing the two showed that the distributions of dissolved CO 2 in the water column were equal when a small standard deviation was used. With a larger standard deviation the vertical spread was greater with the lognormal distribution than with the normal probability distribution. The vertical spread is especially sensitive to the presence of large drops in the drop distribution...|$|R
