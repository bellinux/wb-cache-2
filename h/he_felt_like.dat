Simmonds was angry {{and stated that}} <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he was {{discriminated}} against. WhiteWater World cited manufacturer guidelines and safety concerns as the reasons behind the restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Del Arco had {{no concept}} of what a Borg was prior to the audition. He {{received}} his script on the evening prior to meeting with the producers and felt that {{it gave him a}} decent sense of the character. Instead, Del Arco later explained that he was deliberately anti-social towards the other actors at the audition in order to get into Hugh's mindset. When he performed for the producers, someone else read the lines assigned to Picard and La Forge, and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he immediately got a positive result. He received a call back, and returned to audition once more.|$|E
5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that {{he knew what he was}} doing.|$|E

5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including one in which he was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 1942, Finucane {{was given}} command of No. 602 Squadron RAF at RAF Redhill. Five days later Group Captain Victor Beamish arrived {{as the new}} station commander. Beamish {{promoted}} Finucane instantly {{to the rank of}} squadron leader. Beamish had flown in the Battle of Britain and was posted to Group Captain Operations headquarters at 11 Group in 1941. Beamish frequently asked for an operational command and eventually Leigh-Mallory relented and gave him Redhill. Beamish was ordered not to fly on operations but usually flew whenever <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it. Beamish was killed on operations just two months later. Finucane observed 602's Glasgow traditions by reviving the squadron badge which pictured the Scottish lion rampant in red.|$|E
5|$|Arthur and {{his mother}} Atlanna are flying over the Bermuda Triangle. As they get closer, Atlanna's {{necklace}} begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by a siren, but not before giving Arthur her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a marine park. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman {{is looking for a}} connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day.|$|E

25|$|He {{was one of}} the Dubois Brothers. He {{was convicted}} of murder after he dumped a bartenderâ€™s body into the Lachine Canal in 1975. Jean-Guy had a son named Alain Dubois who grew up as Jean-Guy served his time for second degree murder and later {{continued}} the cycle of criminality because as he claimed it was the only place <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he fit in.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Altman an Academy Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement. During his {{acceptance}} speech, he {{revealed that he}} had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier. The director then quipped that perhaps the Academy had acted prematurely in recognizing the body of his work, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he might have four more decades of life ahead of him.|$|E

25|$|York had {{experienced}} freedom on his adventures with Lewis and Clark. He {{was part of}} the team and he contributed just like the rest with hunting, fishing, putting up tents etc. He had crossed rivers and mountains on the expedition and had a taste of what true freedom is like. On the expedition <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a free man, and then when he returned east he was a slave again, in a world where there was slavery and bondage.|$|E
25|$|From 1989 to 1997, Ali {{attended}} King Edward VI Five Ways School. He {{has said}} that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a misfit at his school, being {{one of only a}} handful of Muslims in the overwhelmingly Anglo student body. As a youth, he found himself torn between an Islamic upbringing and the Birmingham's thriving club scene. In his late teens and early twenties, Ali entrenched himself in the urban Hip hop music scene, a lifestyle of late nights and partying that he said eventually left him disillusioned.|$|E
25|$|In {{designing}} the Jedi Master Yoda, Stuart Freeborn used {{his own face}} as a model and added the wrinkles of Albert Einstein for the appearance of exceptional intelligence. Sets for Dagobah were built five feet above the stage floor, allowing puppeteers to crawl underneath and hold up the Yoda puppet. The setup presented communication problems for Frank Oz, who portrayed Yoda, as he was underneath the stage and unable to hear the crew and Mark Hamill above. Hamill later expressed his dismay at being the only human character on set for months; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a trivial element {{on a set of}} animals, machines, and moving props. Kershner commended Hamill for his performance with the puppet.|$|E
60|$|Mr Brass {{thought that}} if he did, the Grand Turk's {{feelings}} {{were by no means}} to be envied, but he said it was famous, and he had no doubt <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> very <b>like</b> that Potentate.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{went through}} the gap. Perhaps it was {{soothing}} quietness, but <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>liked</b> Kelshope and his curiosity was excited. He knew the big Canadian hotels, the pullmans and observation-cars. So far, money had supplied him, as in London, with much that made life smooth. Now he was to see something of the Canada in which man must labor for all he gets. The strange thing was, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> this was the Canada he really ought to know.|$|R
60|$|Swithin did {{not exactly}} carol and sing like a bird, but <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> almost <b>like</b> endeavouring to hum a tune, {{as he stepped}} out of Hyde Park Mansions, and {{contemplated}} his horses drawn up before the door.|$|R
25|$|While {{writing the}} stories in the collection, Tatsumi was running a {{publishing}} house for manga rental shops so {{he did not have}} time to work on his own manga. At the same time, manga rental shops were declining in favor of manga magazines. According to Tatsumi in a 2004 interview, because <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> an outcast in the manga industry, he wanted to sincerely portray the working class around him in slice of life portraits. He was also influenced by police reports and human interest stories in newspapers. When he was given an assignment, he would choose three stories from twenty of his ideas and show the layouts for his editor to choose one. He would draw the actual stories without assistants using Kent paper and calligraphic pens.|$|E
25|$|He {{disliked the}} provinces outside London, and while his family enjoyed the seaside, and men of science {{were having a}} good time {{at a meeting of the}} British Association in the country, he {{remained}} in the hot and dusty libraries of the metropolis. He said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> Socrates, who declared that the farther he was from Athens the farther was he from happiness. He never sought to become a Fellow of the Royal Society, and he never attended a meeting of the Society; he said that he had no ideas or sympathies in common with the physical philosopher. His attitude was possibly due to his physical infirmity, which prevented him from being either an observer or an experimenter. He never voted at an election, and he never visited the House of Commons, the Tower of London or Westminster Abbey.|$|E
25|$|Uyesugi {{pleaded not}} guilty by reason of {{insanity}} and claimed that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> an outcast at work and that he feared his colleagues were conspiring to have him fired. Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Daryl Matthews testified for the defense that he was insane, citing the delusions about how others were tampering with his fish. Lead prosecution expert witness Dr. Harold Hall testified that the Defendant fulfilled the criteria for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he did not meet the criteria for either insanity or extreme emotion or mental disturbance (EMED). Dr. Michael Welner testified for the prosecution that although Mr. Uyesugi was in his opinion a schizophrenic, he carried out the shooting because he was angry that he would be fired for insubordination, and that his own account of concealment before the crime demonstrated that he knew what he had done was wrong.|$|E

25|$|For Bavaria itself Charles Theodore did {{less than}} nothing. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a {{foreigner}} among foreigners, and his favourite scheme, {{the subject of}} endless intrigues with the Austrian cabinet and the immediate cause of Frederick II's League of Princes (FÃ¼rstenbund) of 1785, was to exchange Bavaria for the Austrian Netherlands and the title of king of Burgundy. For the rest, the enlightened internal policy of his predecessor was abandoned. The funds of the suppressed Society of Jesus, which Maximilian Joseph had destined for the reform of the educational system of the country, were used to endow a province of the knights of St John of Jerusalem, {{for the purpose of}} combating the enemies of the faith. The government was inspired by the narrowest clericalism, which culminated in the attempt to withdraw the Bavarian bishops from the jurisdiction of the great German metropolitans and place them directly under that of the pope. On the eve of the Revolution the intellectual and social condition of Bavaria remained that of the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2016, AndrÃ© Gomes and Paco AlcÃ¡cer were both sold to Barcelona and Shkodran Mustafi was sold to Arsenal, while Ezequiel Garay and former Manchester United player Nani were brought in. Pako AyestarÃ¡n was sacked on 21 September 2016 after four-straight defeats at the {{beginning}} of the 2016â€“17 season. Former Italy national team head coach Cesare Prandelli was hired as his replacement on 28 September. However, he resigned after just three months on 30 December, claiming the club had made him false transfer promises. Days later, on 7 January 2017, Valencia sporting director JesÃºs GarcÃ­a Pitarch also resigned, saying <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he was being used as a shield for criticism by the club and that he could not defend something he no longer believed in. Voro was named caretaker manager for the fifth time until the end of season, with Valencia in 17th position and in danger of relegation. However, results improved under Voro and he steered Valencia clear off relegation, ultimately finishing the season in 13th place. On 27 March, Mateu Alemany was named the new director general of Valencia.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good feeling about the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had already gotten used to him, and Owens said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> he was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E
