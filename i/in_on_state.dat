It also produces 1080p full HD video supplemented by video light (flash continuously <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>state).</b> The phone also has a built-in secondary camera (front-facing camera) for video calling and video chatting, the resolution is 640 x 480 VGA. The smartphone has various features including Smile detection, Sweep Panorama, 3D Sweep Multi angle and 3D Sweep panorama. Many users have reported problem with camera after updating the OS to Android ICS. In various 3rd-party applications that used the camera of the phone, the viewfinder couldn't show the full image but rather a half blacked out image. Sometimes, the camera produced images that had a black patch when shooting with the 8MP (4:3 aspect ratio) mode in the stock camera application. These issues were fixed in Android Jelly Bean 4.1.2 update released on April, 2013. But, 3D Sweep Multi Angle and 3D Sweep Panorama features have been removed which were features since {{the launch of the}} device with the Android Gingerbread firmware.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} {{electrical}} instability under bias stress in pentacene-based transistors with gate dielectrics deposited by a lamination process. Mylar film is laminated onto a polyethylene terephtha- late (PET) substrate, on which aluminum (Al) gate is deposited, followed by evaporation of organic semiconductor and gold (Au) source/drain contacts in bottom gate top contact configuration (Device 1). In order {{to compare the}} influence of the semiconductor/dielectric interface, a second organic tran- sistor (Device 2) which is different from the Device 1 by the deposition of an intermediate layer of po- lymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) onto the laminated Mylar dielectric and before evaporating pentacene layer is fabricated. The critical device parameters such as threshold voltage (VT), subthreshold slope (S), mobility (μ), onset voltage (Von) and Ion/Ioff ratio have been studied. The results showed that the recorded hysteresis depend on the pentacene morphology. Moreover, after bias stress application, the electrical parameters are highly modified for both devices according to the regimes in which the tran- sistors are operating. <b>In</b> <b>ON</b> <b>state</b> regime, Device 1 showed a pronounced threshold voltage shift asso- ciated to charge trapping, while keeping the μ, Ioff current and S minimally affected. Regardless of whether Device 2 exhibited better electrical performances and stability <b>in</b> <b>ON</b> <b>state,</b> we observed a bias stress-induced increase of depletion current and subthreshold slope in subthreshold region, a sign of defect creation.

40|$|Using the tight-binding {{approximation}} and the nonequilibrium Green's function approach, {{we investigate}} the coherent spin-dependent transport in planar magnetic junctions {{consisting of two}} ferromagnetic (FM) electrodes separated by a graphene flake (GF) with zigzag or armchair interfaces. It is found that the electron conduction strongly depends on the geometry of contact between the GF and the FM electrodes. In the case of zigzag interfaces, the junction demonstrates a spin-valve effect with high magnetoresistance (MR) ratios and shows negative differential resistance features for a single spin channel at positive gate voltage. In the case of armchair interfaces, the current-voltage characteristics behave linearly at low bias voltages and hence, both spin channels are <b>in</b> <b>on</b> <b>state</b> with low MR ratios.
