40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis adds to {{the limited}} information on Swedish foreign aid and its determinants. The thesis evaluates Swedish Official Development Assistance (ODA) {{on the basis of}} contemporary research regarding aid effectiveness and poverty alleviation. Econometric tests utilising panel data are performed for democratic consistency, good policies consistency and institutional consistency of ODA flows. The sample is based on data from 1980 to 2006 and is divided into subgroups based on recipient population and the point in time for the disbursement in question. The figures reveal no consistency between Swedish ODA and a relatively democratic state {{on the side of the}} recipient, nor any <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> ODA flows favouring so-called good policies. However, some <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> systematic <b>disbursements</b> to a relatively healthier institutional environment is found, albeit only for the first testing period (1980 - 1996). The second period (1997 - 2006) shows no signs of such consistencies for any subgroup, indicating that this trend is on the decline. The author finds it notable that Swedish ODA agencies have used the research in question to justify the present operations for two reasons. First, no evidence that such research is guiding the operations of those agencies is revealed and second, the tests reveals no significant changes from the first period to the second, despite the fact that the vast majority of well-cited research has been published from 1998 onwards...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Reproductive {{health needs}} are {{particularly}} acute in countries affected by armed conflict. Reliable information on aid investment for reproductive health {{in these countries}} is essential for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of aid. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyse official development assistance (ODA) for reproductive health activities in conflict-affected countries from 2003 to 2006. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The Creditor Reporting System and the Financial Tracking System databases were the chosen data sources for the study. ODA disbursement for reproductive health activities to 18 conflict-affected countries was analysed for 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006. An average of US $ 20. 8 billion in total ODA was disbursed annually to the 18 conflict-affected countries between 2003 and 2006, of which US $ 509. 3 million (2. 4 %) was allocated to reproductive health. This represents an annual average of US $ 1. 30 disbursed per capita in the 18 sampled countries for reproductive health activities. Non-conflict-affected least-developed countries received 53. 3 % more ODA for reproductive health activities than conflict-affected least-developed countries, despite the latter generally having greater reproductive health needs. ODA disbursed for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment increased by 119. 4 % from 2003 to 2006. The ODA disbursed for other direct reproductive health activities declined by 35. 9 % over the same period. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> inequity in <b>disbursement</b> <b>of</b> reproductive health ODA between conflict-affected countries and non-conflict-affected countries, and between different reproductive health activities. These findings and the study's recommendations seek to support initiatives to make aid financing more responsive to need in the context of armed conflic...|$|R

The Chapter also talks about the authorization of the delegated person to sign on behalf of the Borrower Countries, and the legal opinion of the Loan Agreement. Chapter three also clarifies the withdrawal of proceeds of the loan, its arrangements, procedure and means <b>of</b> withdrawal (<b>disbursement,</b> reimbursement and letter of credit), requirements <b>of</b> <b>disbursement</b> and avoiding delays <b>of</b> <b>disbursement.</b> Chapter four talks about the failure to fulfill the financial obligations and covenants which result in the suspension <b>of</b> <b>disbursements</b> and sometimes the cancellation of the loan.
