5000|$|<b>De-gassed</b> {{conductivity}} is {{the finest}} level of conductivity measurement. Here one removes the masking effects of dissolved gases, mainly CO2, on the conductivity measurement. In the <b>De-Gassed</b> conductivity system, {{there is a}} reboil chamber to heat the sample, so that the dissolved gases are liberated {{and then there is}} cooling mechanism, by which the hot liquid is cooled again. The conductivity measured after this process is indeed the 'real' value of conductivity because of 'dissolved' impurities  after eliminating the dissolved gases.|$|E

The oil collects in sump (1), is withdrawn continuously by scavenge pump (2) and {{travels to the}} oil tank (3), where gases entrained in the oil separate and the oil cools. Gases (6) are returned to the engine sump. Pressure pump (4) forces the <b>de-gassed</b> and cooled oil (5) back to the engine's lubrication points (7).|$|E
5000|$|Nucleation {{in boiling}} {{can occur in}} the bulk liquid if the {{pressure}} is reduced so that the liquid becomes superheated {{with respect to the}} pressure-dependent boiling point. More often, nucleation occurs on the heating surface, at nucleation sites. Typically, nucleation sites are tiny crevices where free gas-liquid surface is maintained or spots on the heating surface with lower wetting properties. Substantial superheating of a liquid can be achieved after the liquid is <b>de-gassed</b> and if the heating surfaces are clean, smooth and made of materials well wetted by the liquid.|$|E

40|$|Poly-di-methyl-siloxane (PDMS) {{hollow fibre}} {{membrane}} modules were {{designed and built}} for the specific <b>de-gassing</b> of real and synthetic process liquids to understand: (i) the feasibility of operation; and (ii) classify the mass transfer characteristics to aid design at full scale. Liquid saturated with pure methane or a binary methane and carbon dioxide mixture was introduced into the shell side of the extraction unit, whilst sweep gas or vacuum was employed counter-currently as a stripping medium. From data analysis of operation in both anaerobic effluents obtained from Expanded Granular Sludge Blanket (EGSB) reactor and synthetic liquids, when operating under optimum conditions 93 % of methane and 88 % of carbon dioxide was recovered. The obtained data indicate that the extraction process is controlled by diffusivity of gases through the PDMS membrane and {{is proportional to the}} thickness of membrane wall. When applying vacuum to promote methane mass transfer, the process was highly sensitive to vacuum pressure; the highest <b>de-gassing</b> efficiency was recorded under the lowest absolute vacuum pressure. However, when vacuum was replaced by sweep gas, the process was insensitive to changes in gas velocity. When utilising PDMS membrane contactor for <b>de-gassing</b> of EGSB effluent, the net electrical output achieved by the EGSB increased by c. 24 % and indicates that by integrating methane recovery, treatment of domestic wastewater using low temperature EGSB processes can become carbon positive. The potential of directing recovered methane to porous hollow fibre membrane absorbers and upgrading to national gas (NG) standards to use in national gas grid or as a vehicle fuel has been demonstrated...|$|R
50|$|A second {{theory on}} the warm Cretaceous is the {{subduction}} of carbonate materials. By subducting carboniferous materials, {{a release of}} carbon dioxide would emit from volcanoes. During the Cretaceous, the Tethys Sea was rich in limestone deposits. By subducting this carboniferous platform, the resulting magma would have become more carbon dioxide rich. Because carbon dioxide dissolves into melts well, it would have remained dissolved until the confining pressure of the magma was low enough to <b>de-gas</b> and release massive quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere causing warming.|$|R
50|$|Traditional {{underground}} high-tension cables {{are constructed}} either with internal oil ducts or channels {{or by the}} use of a pipe through which the insulated conductor is installed. In either design the system is then filled with pressurised, <b>de-gassed</b> oil. The oils primary function is to improve the insulating properties of the cable but occasionally leaks can occur through cable joints, oil system fittings or cable sheath damage. The leak is initially identified by the loss of liquid from the system, but its location used to involve engineers digging up the road, freezing a section of cable and seeing if the level was still going down, then choosing a new point to dig and re-freeze. It could take several holes to isolate the leak. If a PFT is injected into the oil, there will be a relatively high concentration of PFT above the leak, which can be pin-pointed to within a few feet, requiring only a single hole to be dug right where the leak is.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity of ultra-pure water is 5.5 &times; 10−6 S/m (18 MΩ·cm in the reciprocal terms of electrical resistivity) and is due only to H+ and OH− ions {{produced in the}} water dissociation equilibrium. This low conductivity is only achieved, however, {{in the presence of}} dissolved monatomic gases. Completely <b>de-gassed</b> ultrapure water has a conductivity of 1.2 &times; 10−4 S/m, whereas on equilibration to the atmosphere it is 7.5 &times; 10−5 S/m due to dissolved CO2 in it. The highest grades of ultrapure water should not be stored in glass or plastic containers because these container materials leach (release) contaminants at very low concentrations. Storage vessels made of silica are used for less-demanding applications and vessels of ultrapure tin are used for the highest-purity applications. It is worth noting that, although {{electrical conductivity}} only indicates the presence of ions, the majority of common contaminants found naturally in water ionize to some degree. This ionization is a good measure of the efficacy of a filtration system, and more expensive systems incorporate conductivity-based alarms to indicate when filters should be refreshed or replaced. For comparison, sea water has a conductivity of perhaps 5 S/m (53 mS/cm is quoted), while normal un-purified tap water may have conductivity of 5 mS/m (50 μS/cm) (to within an order of magnitude), which is still about 2 or 3 orders of magnitude higher than the output from a well-functioning demineralizing or distillation mechanism, so low levels of contamination or declining performance are easily detected.|$|E

However, due to a high content of readily available nitrogen, application must be carefully timed with plant growth to prevent nitrogen loss. Long-term consequences for soil fertility should be studied further...|$|E
50|$|In this area, {{there are}} 17 hot water springs {{in which the}} {{temperature}} ranges from 35 C to 100 C. The water that emerges from the spring is transported 320 m {{to the head of}} the travertine terraces and deposits calcium carbonate on a section 60 to 70 m long covering an expanse of 24 m to 30 m. When the water, supersaturated with calcium carbonate, reaches the surface, carbon dioxide <b>de-gasses</b> from it, and calcium carbonate is deposited. Calcium carbonate is deposited by the water as a soft gel which eventually crystallizes into travertine.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} attractions of spray forming is the {{potential}} economic benefit {{to be gained from}} reducing the number of process steps between melt and finished product. Spray forming can be used to produce strip, tube, ring, clad bar / roll and cylindrical extrusion feed stock products, in each case with a relatively fine-scale microstructure even in large cross-sections. The benefits of GASF over powder metallurgy accrue from the reduced number of process steps where powder sieving, pressing, <b>de-gassing</b> and handling steps and their attendant safety and contamination issues may be removed.|$|R
40|$|For {{polishing}} the ultra-thin TMT M 3 MP, a polishing {{support system}} with 18 hydraulic supports (HS) is introduced. This work {{focuses on the}} designing and testing of these HSs. Firstly the design concept of HS system is discussed; then mechanical implementation of the HS structure is carried out, with special consideration of fluid cycling, work pressurization and the weight component. Afterward the piping installation and the <b>de-gas</b> process for the working fluid are implemented. Pressurization and stiffness are well checked before system integration for the single HS unit. Finally the support system is integrated for the polishing process...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{material}} modification and cross-linking by-products (residues) quantity on space charge accumulation and decay in XLPE {{have been investigated}} using the pulsed electro-acoustic technique. The threshold stress for space charge generation during voltage-ramping was found to show considerable variation and to depend upon the material {{and the amount of}} residue present. However, the modified XLPE material was found to exhibit a higher threshold for space charge accumulation than the reference XLPE whatever the conditions. <b>De-gassed</b> samples were found to exhibit the highest threshold stress, with that of the modified <b>de-gassed</b> XLPE accumulating no space charge at all even after 24 hours stressing at 70 kV. In general heterocharge regions were formed when the residues were present and homocharge or no charge was formed when the residues were removed by degassing. Differences were also found in the space charge decay following short-circuit (volts-off), with the decay of heterocharge being rapid, whereas that of homocharge was slow. A tentative explanation is offered to explain these features...|$|E
30|$|The {{measurement}} procedure {{starts with a}} water flush. The system is <b>de-gassed</b> by opening the bypass valve (5) and valves at the pressure transducer. After this step, the valves are closed and the set-up pump is stopped. Any water {{is removed from the}} intake container and the test fluid is flushed through the system a number of times. A flow rate in the range of 50 to 900  ml/min is set and the pressure drop is allowed to stabilize (ca. 5  min). After stabilizing, the differential pressure drop is measured for 5  min at 5  s intervals as a function of set flow.|$|E
40|$|Megasonic {{cleaning}} using <b>de-gassed</b> water (less than 2 ppm N 2, O 2, CO 2) in a 300 mm batch immersion tool {{often does}} not give optimal particle performance, with particle streaks and clusters added onto the wafer, and low particle removal efficiency (PRE). When water was re-gasified with N 2, the resultant stable cavitation activity reduced particle adders and increased PRE. With N 2 concentration increased to just above 5 ppm, number of particle adders decreased by three folds. Optimal particle performance could be obtained by operating at an N 2 level close to saturation...|$|E
25|$|Generally {{the same}} {{sedimentary}} types {{are present in}} the marls as are in the waterstones but with less arenaceous and more argillaceous material. An irregular rhythm is discernible, each sedimentary cycle is well developed and have banded or stippled beds at the base. It is in this banded stratum that features such as sun cracks are found. Ripple marks are less common but they are evidence of deposition in shallow water. Pitting sometimes found has been linked to rain pitting but may have occurred during the <b>de-gassing</b> of the marls during drying out. The banded strata which may be red or grey pass up into blocky unstratified mudstones (broken up and allowed to resettle before consolidation).|$|R
40|$|Recent {{work has}} shown that heating {{degassed}} oil-in-water emulsions causes {{a significant reduction in}} the oil droplet size. The results presented here report further work on the effect of changes in salt concentration, oil/water ratio, pH and heating, on the oil droplet sizes of dispersions produced by the <b>de-gassing</b> process. The change in particle or droplet size for long, straight chain hydrocarbon oils, dispersed in water by degassing, is also reported here. These oils, of 20 - 24 carbon units in length, are liquid when heated above 50 °C but are solid at room temperature. The particle size of these dispersions was also monitored during the phase transition from liquid to solid, on cooling...|$|R
50|$|Bumping {{occurs when}} liquids are heated or has its {{pressure}} reduced very rapidly, typically in smooth, clean glassware. The {{hardest part of}} bubble formation is {{the formation of the}} small bubble; once a bubble has formed, it can grow quickly. Because the liquid is typically above its boiling point, when the liquid finally starts to boil, a large vapor bubble is formed that pushes the liquid out of the test tube, typically at high speed. This rapid expulsion of boiling liquid poses a serious hazard to others and oneself in the lab. Furthermore, if a liquid is boiled and cooled back down, the chance of bumping increases on each subsequent boil, because each heating cycle progressively <b>de-gasses</b> the liquid, reducing the number of remaining nucleation sites.|$|R

The reactor produced a homogeneous and <b>de-gassed</b> melt over a skull of the same composition within a single chamber, which allowed the rapid attainment of steady state conditions. The as-cast tiles were subjected to a scientifically defined cooling and heat treatment cycle to encourage the formation of crystalline phases and a uniform microstructure. The material performance requirements for economical viability, practical applications and ecological compatibility have been assessed. Dynamic process control has been used to compensate for the complex and variable nature of the waste streams to produce a consistent product...|$|E
40|$|Electrophoresis {{studies on}} pure {{hydrocarbon}} oil droplets, dispersed in water, have established {{that a significant}} charge is naturally developed on the droplets surface due to the spontaneous adsorption of hydroxyl ions. It has subsequently been pointed out that this charge should ensure the meta-stability of fine, micron-sized oil droplets dispersed in water. Further {{studies have demonstrated that}} such dispersions can be produced by the vigorous shaking of <b>de-gassed</b> mixtures of oil and water. De-gassing appears to enhance the dispersion process and the natural charging of the oildroplets ensures their meta-stability. Using this enhanced dispersion process, we have found that subsequent heating and cooling cycles, carried out over several minutes, can alter the average droplet size and the droplet size distribution, in some cases producing narrower distributions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} work {{carried out}} in the Department of Applied Physics, Durham University, from October 1964 to September 1967. The work was a continuation of investigations, under the supervision of Dr. M. J. Mo rant, into the electrical properties of dielectric liquids. The work of Sletten in 1959 and that of Morant and Kahan in 1964 has shown that dissolved oxygen has a marked effect on the breakdown strength and the conductivity of a typical dielectric liquid, n-hexane. The present investigation shows that the reduced breakdown strength and increased conductivity observed on de-gassing hexane may not be explained in terms of an increase in carrier mobility. The mobility of photo-injected carriers in highly <b>de-gassed</b> hexane is found to be no greater than the mobility of the same carriers in air-saturated liquid. Further, no increase of mobility with applied field is observed in the <b>de-gassed</b> liquid for fields up to 140 KV/cm; nor is there any indication, under these conditions, of the existence of an additional 'fast' carrier. The variation of the injected current with both the applied field and the degree of oxidation of the cathode, however, indicates that the 'oxygen effect' referred to above is an electrode, surface phenomenon and not a property of the liquid itself. The current transients from which the mobility determinations were made are not exactly of the form predicted by simple theory. This and other anomalous observations indicate a strong interaction between the charge-carriers and the neutral liquid molecules. Such an interaction is consistent with self-trapping of the injected carriers by polarization of the surrounding medium. Suggestions for further work on the identification of the charge-carriers in dielectric liquids and on the factors affecting breakdown and conductivity are made in the text...|$|E
50|$|Extending {{the shelf}} life of roasted coffee relies on {{maintaining}} an optimum environment {{to protect it}} from exposure to heat, oxygen, and light. Roasted coffee has an optimal typical shelf life of two weeks, and ground coffee about 15 minutes. Without some sort of preservation method, coffee becomes stale. The first large-scale preservation technique was vacuum packing in cans. However, because coffee emits CO2 after roasting, coffee to be vacuum-packed must be allowed to <b>de-gas</b> for several days before it is sealed. To allow more immediate packaging, pressurized canisters or foil-lined bags with pressure-relief valves can be used. Refrigeration and freezing retards the staling process. Roasted whole beans can be considered fresh for up to one month if kept cool. Once coffee is ground it is best used immediately.|$|R

40|$|Evidence for {{long-term}} {{changes in the}} soil composition of selected organic compounds, brought about by exchanges with the atmosphere, is briefly reviewed. In the case of some compounds — such as benzo(a) pyrene and octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, soils may be significant long-term environmental sinks for atmospherically-derived material. In other cases — such as phenanthrene {{and some of the}} lighter PCBs, <b>de-gassing</b> or volatilisation from soil back to the air can occur under certain conditions. Hence the soil may act as a “short-term” sink, and a potential source to atmosphere. Indeed, for some ‘semi-volatile’ compounds used in large quantities in the past — such as PCBs, soil outgassing may actually be an extremely important source to contemporary air. Furthermore, soil outgassing from areas of former high use may provide an important driving mechanism for continued “global cycling” of a range of semi-volatile organochlorine compounds...|$|R
40|$|The mass {{transfer}} {{performance of a}} gas-liquid self-ingesting stirred reactor is reported both for coalescing and non-coalescing systems. The vessel features are a high aspect ratio and a rather narrow multiple-impeller draft tube, through which the gas phase is ingested and led down to the vessel bottom, where it is finely dispersed into the liquid rising in the annular portion of the vessel. Comparison is made between k(L) a values determined by several variants of the dynamic method, among which pure oxygen absorption in a previously <b>de-gassed</b> liquid phase. Results show that the gas-liquid {{mass transfer}} coefficient values obtained with the last approach are remarkably larger than those measured with all other techniques in which nitrogen is initially dissolved in the liquid phase.

40|$|The {{longitudinal}} permeability of four 27 -year-old {{trees of}} radiata pine (Pinus radiata D.

Significant permeability {{differences were found between}} trees, and there was a negative correlation between longitudinal permeability and density. The longitudinal permeability of sapwood increased significantly with height in the stem from the butt to just below the crown. No consistent pattern of variation was observed with radial position over a cross-section. This is attributed to the relatively large fraction of the permeation area in the outer sapwood that is occupied by latewood, and to the presence of compression wood. An abrupt decline in permeability occurred at the boundary between the wet sapwood and dry wood zones. Results were in general agreement with those of comparable studies on other species...|$|E
30|$|Gas {{drainage}} {{has proven}} to be an effective method to control gas emission and outbursts of coal and gas in underground coal mining (Black and Aziz 2009; Yuan 2010; Karacan et al. 2011). Based on the simulation test, gas control measures were developed to manage gas issues in panel 1111 (1). These measures included mainly goaf gas drainage with buried pipes in the goaf, surface vertical wells, and cross-measure boreholes. The return air volume was 2290 – 2700  m 3 /min during gas drainage period. Gas concentration in return air was less than 0.6  %. Gas extraction rate in the working face was more than 60  %. The average gas extraction rate was 70  %. With these gas control measures, panel 1111 (1) was mined without encountering any gas-related safety issues. With stress relief mining of No. 11 - 2 coal seam, the protected area of No. 13 coal seam was extensively de-stressed and <b>de-gassed.</b> The risk of coal and gas outburst during both development of headings and panel extraction was minimized, and a significant gain was achieved in the production of panel 1111 (1).|$|E

50|$|RTM {{requires}} an injection apparatus capable of injecting resin {{at a high}} pressure and temperature. One method of injecting epoxy for RTM fabrication is a positive displacement injection system. In the positive displacement injection system, resin is placed into a special cylinder. The bottom of the cylinder is a movable piston. A degassing process can be conducted after loading the resin into the cylinder by sealing the cylinder and applying a vacuum. The piston can move up the cylinder to decrease cylinder volume and force resin out a tube and into the mold. The piston is connected to an actuator. The actuator pushes the piston up the cylinder forcing the resin out at high pressure through tubing and into the mold. Positive displacement injectors have the advantages of precise control over resin pressure, flow rate, and temperature control. It also allows for resin <b>de-gassing.</b>|$|R
50|$|This process became {{especially}} important for {{the new generation of}} high detective quantum efficiency, fine-grained (but slow) plates Eastman Kodak had developed in the late 1960s. In 1974, researchers at Eastman Kodak announced that plates treated in pure hydrogen after nitrogen treatment were more sensitive at all exposure times than untreated plates, and this was quickly adopted by many observatories, some of whom used non-explosive forming gas (a 4-8% mixture of hydrogen in nitrogen) for reasons of safety. The optimum gas-phase processes combine the effects of heating and <b>de-gassing</b> with reduction sensitization by pure hydrogen to give a sensitivity gain of about 30 times for an hour-long exposure. This worked very well with fine-grain, high resolution emulsions on film, typified by Eastman Kodak's Tech Pan Film. They were also effective with negative and reversal color film, but were unpredictable and could produce difficult-to-correct shifts in color balance.|$|R

These high performance/high temperature composites are potentially useful on advanced aerospace vehicles in structural applications and as aircraft engine components such as inlet frames and compressor vanes. The number designation (i. e. 298, 330) refers to the glass transition temperature in degrees Celsius as determined on neat resin cured for 1 hour at 371 °C. The resins are processable by non-autoclave techniques such as resin transfer molding (RTM), vacuum assisted RTM (VARTM) and resin infusion (RI). Both resins exhibit low complex melt viscosities (0. 1 - 10 poise) at 280 °C and are stable for ≥ 2 hours at this temperature.

The granules were comprised of an undefined anaerobic thermophilic multispecies consortium of bacteria. In order to establish the thermophilic bacterial granules, the bioreactor was operated as a chemostat under increasing dilution rates. This promoted the selection and enrichment of thermophilic granules comprised of a multispecies bacterial consortium. Endo medium {{which is one of the}} most basic bacteriological nutrient mediums was used as the nutrient supply in the granule generating chemostat experiments. Bacterial inoculums from mesophilic environments were used to induce and establish thermophilic and extreme-thermophilic adapted bacterial granules in the chemostat experiments.

40|$|Thanks to {{its good}} thermal stability, {{including}} resistance to oxidation, platinum (Pt) {{is widely used}} in prototyping {{a wide spectrum of}} electron devices ranging from metaloxide- semiconductor (MOS) transistors to resistive switching memory cells. In this work, the energy barriers for electrons between the Fermi level of Pt and the conduction band of several oxide insulators (SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, HfO 2, Hf 0. 8 Al 0. 2 Ox, Sr 0. 53 Ti 0. 47 O 3) were determined by using internal photoemission of electrons. By combining this barrier value with the electron affinity of the particular oxide, the effective work function (EWF) of Pt was determined for different interfaces. As studied over the reference Pt/oxide/Si stacks <b>de-gassed</b> in high vacuum at 400 8 C, the EWF of Pt is found to differ significantly from the accepted vacuum WF value of 5. 6 eV. The EWF is equal to 5. 2 eV at the Pt/Al 2 O 3 interface, 5. 1 eV at Pt/HfO 2, 5. 3 eV at Pt/Hf 0. 8 Al 0. 2 Ox, 4. 8 eV at Pt/SiO 2, and 5. 8 eV at the Pt/Sr 0. 53 Ti 0. 47 O 3 interface indicating the presence of a polarization layer of which the contribution to the EWF depends on the oxide composition. Furthermore, annealing in H 2 at 400 8 C reduces the Pt EWF by 0. 5 eV at all interfaces except for the Pt/Sr 0. 53 Ti 0. 47 O 3 one. This observation indicates the formation of an additional H-related dipole at the Pt/oxide interfaces and suggests that the vacuum WF of Pt cannot be used as the value relevant for the MOS properties. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Water {{permeated}} porous membranes, under a large {{hydrostatic pressure}} differential, {{are likely to}} create opportunities for vapour and dissolved gas cavitation, which will restrict water flow through the membrane void spaces.

Removal of these gases might, therefore, reduce or prevent cavitation and thereby increase the flow rate through the porous membranes used to purify water. Reverse osmosis (RO) membranes operate under high pressure differentials and will be very susceptible to cavitation reduced flow. It is well established that RO membranes have a lower water flux than expected and the reasons for this have yet to be identified.
