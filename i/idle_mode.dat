50|$|Most {{transceivers}} {{operating in}} <b>idle</b> <b>mode</b> have a power consumption almost {{equal to the}} power consumed in receive mode. Thus, {{it is better to}} completely shut down the transceiver rather than leave it in the <b>idle</b> <b>mode</b> when it is not transmitting or receiving. A significant amount of power is consumed when switching from sleep mode to transmit mode in order to transmit a packet.|$|E

40|$|Cryogenic rocket engines {{requiring}} a cooling process to thermally condition {{the engine to}} operating temperature can be made more efficient if cooling propellants can be burned. Tank head idle and pumped <b>idle</b> <b>modes</b> {{can be used to}} burn propellants employed for cooling, thereby providing useful thrust. Such <b>idle</b> <b>modes</b> required the use of a heat exchanger to vaporize oxygen prior to injection into the combustion chamber. During December 1988, Pratt and Whitney conducted a series of engine hot firing demonstrating the operation of two new, previously untested oxidizer heat exchanger designs. The program was a second iteration of previous low thrust testing conducted in 1984, during which a first-generation heat exchanger design was used. Although operation was demonstrated at tank head idle and pumped idle, the engine experienced instability when propellants could not be supplied to the heat exchanger at design conditions...|$|R
5000|$|An early {{microcomputer}} {{power supply}} was either fully on or off, {{controlled by the}} mechanical line-voltage switch, and energy saving low-power <b>idle</b> <b>modes</b> were not a design consideration of early computer power supplies.

40|$|Future lack of {{petroleum}} resources, price hike and environmental concerns {{have led to}} search for more environment friendly and renewable fuels. As an alternative fuel, biodiesel is considered as the most suitable alternative due to its environment friendly aspect and similar operation properties as diesel. In this study, Palm, Jatropha and Calophyllum biodiesel blends {{has been used to}} evaluate performance of a compression ignition engine operated at idling condition. Three <b>idling</b> <b>modes</b> were selected in which operating condition of engine were: a) 1000 RPM 10 % Load, b) 1200 RPM 12 % Load and c) 1500 RPM and 15 % Load. At high idling conditions biodiesel-diesel blends emit less HC and CO, but high amount of NOx compared to diesel fuel. At high idling conditions fuel consumption of biodiesel-diesel blends deteriorate. CIB 20 emitted lowest HC and CO, and highest NOx at all <b>idling</b> <b>mode...</b>|$|R

50|$|Idle {{coasting}} {{is riding}} the vehicle {{at a higher}} speed than the idle speed of the engine and disengaging the engine from the wheels by setting the transmission or gearbox to neutral position or disengage the clutch, remaining the engine in <b>idle</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
50|$|Researchers have {{proposed}} improving the low power idle states of servers, and the wake-up/shutdown latencies between active and <b>idle</b> <b>modes,</b> {{because this is}} an easier optimization goal than active performance scaling. If servers could wake up and shutdown at a very fine time granularity, then the server would become energy proportional, even if active power is constant at all utilizations.|$|R

The mathematical model of energy and magnetic processes in core of inductors is obtained. The mathematical model is generalized to DC-DC and AC-AC converters, to most popular schemes of converters and to transfer, recuperation and <b>idle</b> <b>modes.</b> It is shown that the energy and magnetic processes in core of inductors are identical for DC-DC and AC-AC converters, for buck, boost, buck-boost and fly-back converters, and for transfer, recuperation and <b>idle</b> <b>modes.</b> It is shown that energy processes in converters can be defined by parameters of magnetic flux of inductor core.

50|$|The new three stage i-VTEC {{valvetrain}} has low-rpm, high-rpm and cylinder <b>idle</b> <b>mode.</b> High {{output valve}} timing help {{the engine to}} increase its output by 9 percent. During deceleration, the engine is kept idle. There are no combustion in all four cylinders and the cylinders are sealed shut, reducing pumping losses by engine. As a result, recovery of energy wasted during braking is improved by 10 percent.|$|E
50|$|Another {{research}} group proposed trading off memory bandwidth for lower energy per bit and lower power <b>idle</b> <b>modes</b> in servers by using mobile-class LPDDR2 DRAMs. This would increase memory energy proportionality without affecting performance for datacenter workloads {{that are not}} sensitive to memory bandwidth. The same group also proposed redesigning the DDR3 interface to better support energy proportional server memory without sacrificing peak bandwidth.|$|R
30|$|This {{continuous}} updating of the eOLLA offset can {{be easily}} performed in LTE since there is an estimation of the SNR available every TTI t. In the downlink of LTE and LTE-A, the BS transmits reference signals (RS) [2] at each subframe, in both connected and <b>idle</b> <b>modes.</b> Thus, every UE is able to perform SNR estimation from this RS at each TTI, and so to update its eOLLA offset.|$|R
40|$|The heat {{exchanger}} concept is discussed together with {{its role in}} rocket engine operation in <b>idle</b> <b>modes.</b> Two {{heat exchanger}} designs (low and high heat transfer) utilizing different approaches to achieve stable oxygen vaporization are presented {{as well as their}} performance test results.

The power consumption in the CELL_FACH is roughly 50 percent of that in CELL_DCH, and the PCH states use about 1-2 percent of the power consumption of the CELL_DCH state.|$|E
50|$|CPU time (or process time) is {{the amount}} of time for which a central {{processing}} unit (CPU) was used for processing instructions of a computer program or operating system, as opposed to, for example, waiting for input/output (I/O) operations or entering low-power (<b>idle)</b> <b>mode.</b> The CPU time is measured in clock ticks or seconds.

30|$|DPM {{techniques}} that are applied at the hardware level aim at reconfiguring the systems dynamically by designing methodologies {{to provide the}} requested services with a minimum number of active components or a minimum load on such components. The DPM techniques at a hardware level can selectively turn off the idle system components or reduce {{the performance of the}} partially unexploited ones. Also, it is possible to switch some components, such as the CPU, between active and <b>idle</b> <b>modes</b> to save energy [17, 18].|$|R

50|$|The turbine {{was based}} on an 845 {{kilowatt}} design but was throttled back in order to prevent damage to the other components. The main power was supplied by the diesel - the gas turbine was either on or off, or on <b>idle</b> <b>mode.</b> The chimney like exhaust for the turbine on the locomotive roof was the main distinguishing feature between a Class 210 and similar but conventionally powered locomotives such as the Class 218.|$|E

40|$|An {{engine running}} at low load and low rated speed {{is said to}} be subject to high <b>idling</b> conditions, a <b>mode</b> which {{represents}} one of the major problems currently the transport industry is facing. During this time, the engine can not work at peak operating temperature. This leads to incomplete combustion and emissions level increase due to having fuel residues in the exhaust. Also, idling results in increase in fuel consumption. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate fuel consumption and emissions parameters under high idling conditions when diesel blended with Jatropha curcas biodiesel is used to operate a diesel engine. Although biodiesel diesel blends decrease carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions, they increase nitrogen oxides emissions in high <b>idling</b> <b>modes.</b> Compared to pure diesel fuel, fuel consumption also increases under all high idling conditions for biodiesel -diesel blends, with a further increase occurring as blend percentage rises...|$|R
40|$|Through {{experiment}} {{conducted on}} a six cylinder direct injection diesel engine with SCR catalyst, effects of coolant temperature on rail pressure, injection quantity, excess air coefficient and emissions characteristics during cold and warm start were investigated.

When coolant temperature rose up to above 20 ℃, NOX emissions in the starting process exhibited peculiar rise which was times higher than <b>idling</b> <b>mode.</b> Compared with engine warm start, rail pressure, cycle fuel quantity, opacity, CO and HC emissions during engine cold start were higher in the course from their transient maximal values towards stabilized idling status. NOX in the same transient course, however, were lower in cold start. As coolant temperature rose, the maximal and the idling value of rail pressure and cycle fuel injection quantity during diesel engine starting process decreased gradually, the excess air coefficient increased to a certain degree, and the maximal and idling values of NOX increased gradually...|$|R
