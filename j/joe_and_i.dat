2500|$|Sometime in 1924, when Shuster was 9 or 10, {{his family}} moved to Cleveland, Ohio. There Shuster {{attended}} Glenville High School and befriended his later collaborator, writer Jerry Siegel, with whom he began publishing a science fiction fanzine called Science Fiction. Siegel described his friendship with the similarly shy and bespectacled Shuster: [...] "When <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> first met, it was like the right chemicals coming together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Siegel {{attended}} Glenville High School in Cleveland, Ohio {{and worked}} for its weekly student newspaper, The Torch. He was a shy, not particularly popular student, but became known among his peers for his Tarzan parody, [...] "Goober the Mighty." [...] At about age 16, while at Glenville, he befriended his later collaborator, Joe Shuster. Siegel described his friendship with the similarly shy and bespectacled Shuster: [...] "When <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> first met, {{it was like the}} right chemicals coming together." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jules Feiffer {{has argued}} that Superman's real {{innovation}} lay {{in the creation of}} the Clark Kent persona, noting that what [...] "made Superman extraordinary was his point of origin: Clark Kent." [...] Feiffer develops the theme to establish Superman's popularity in simple wish fulfillment, a point Siegel and Shuster themselves supported, Siegel commenting that [...] "If you're interested in what made Superman what it is, here's one of the keys to what made it universally acceptable. <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had certain inhibitions... which led to wish-fulfillment which we expressed through our interest in science fiction and our comic strip. That's where the dual-identity concept came from" [...] and Shuster supporting that as being [...] "why so many people could relate to it".|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I am back now, <b>Joe,</b> anyhow; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{have got}} ten days before school begins again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> mean {{to make the}} most of it. Are you going out to-day?" ...|$|R
60|$|Some day you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{will walk}} again, <b>Joe,</b> <b>and</b> talk. <b>I</b> hope so. We could have such talks! We are all {{grateful}} to you and Harmony--how grateful it is not given to us to say in words. We pay as we can, in love; and in this coin practicing no economy.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} see you again, <b>Joe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am glad to {{hear you}} are first mate now; though of course, I am sorry for Mr. Probert." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it's late," [...] he remonstrated. [...] "I suppose you've {{got me a}} cake or pie--something to eat. You {{women all}} think <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have to be fed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now keep a sharp lookout," [...] Dave said, [...] "but don't fire {{unless they}} rise again. <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{will make it}} hot for them as they raise their heads to take aim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>Joe,</b> <b>and</b> right glad <b>I</b> am to find you," [...] {{answered}} the young man, while a peculiar expression of pleasure came over his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't get any pupils," [...] she confessed. [...] "And I couldn't bear to {{have you}} give up your lessons; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got a place ironing shirts in that big Twenty-fourth street laundry. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> think I did very well to make up both General Pinkney and Clementina, don't you, <b>Joe?</b> <b>And</b> when {{a girl in the}} laundry set down a hot iron on my hand this {{afternoon}} I was all the way home making up that story about the Welsh rabbit. You're not angry, are you, <b>Joe?</b> <b>And</b> if <b>I</b> hadn't got the work you mightn't have sold your sketches to that man from Peoria." ...|$|R
5000|$|I knew Harry Truman and Dean Acheson {{had lost}} their {{effectiveness}} from {{the day that the}} Communists took over in China. I believed that the loss of China had played a large role in the rise of <b>Joe</b> McCarthy. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> knew that all these problems, taken together, were chickenshit compared with what might happen if we lost Vietnam ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is very {{beautiful}} and right, <b>Joe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> honor you for it; {{but you were}} not meant to tend babies, so sing your last lullabies, {{and be ready to}} go to the Home as soon as I can get you there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Spanish {{officer who}} {{commands}} her {{must be a}} smart fellow," [...] he said, [...] "and {{we have had a}} narrow escape of running our head into a noose--thanks to you, Bob; for <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had quite made up our minds to attack her, in the middle watch.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right, Bob. <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{agreed to}} give you an extra hour, this morning. Four hours are very short measure, to one who is not {{accustomed}} to it; but you will soon find that you can turn in and get a sleep, when your watch is over, whatever the time of day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{promised to}} marry Ted Pringle, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> promised to marry <b>Joe</b> Blossom, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> promised to marry Albert Parsons. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to}} promise to marry Arthur Brown and anybody else who asked me. So now you know! I told you I'd make father {{take me back to}} London. Well, when he hears that I've promised to marry four {{different}} men, I bet he'll have me home by the first train.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "P'r'aps it's {{all along}} of her bein' so {{interested}} in you," [...] replied pretty Mrs Davidson. [...] "She asks me many odd questions at times about myself, <b>and</b> my dear <b>Joe,</b> <b>and</b> the babby--though <b>I</b> admit she don't inquire much about my past life." ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{was when}} she {{released}} her demo EP, including early versions of [...] "Boats and Birds" [...] and [...] "Isabelle". When asked about going by her real name, Godreau responds, [...] "There {{is no reason for}} it. But, I’d walk by places and it’d say ‘Playing Tonight - <b>Joe</b> Jones’ <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that was super-boring and I’d never want to go to that show".|$|R
6000|$|... "He and I {{were the}} two {{survivors}} of {{the wreck of the}} Huahine," [...] Tudor explained to the others. [...] "Fifty-seven all told on board when we sailed from Huapa, and <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were the only two that ever set foot on land again. Hurricane, you know, in the Paumotus. That was when I was after pearls." ...|$|E
60|$|However, I {{came into}} {{town on the}} Monday night {{to be ready for}} <b>Joe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have {{concealed}} the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak giant of a Sweep.|$|E
60|$|When {{we came to}} Pumblechook's, {{my sister}} bounced in and left us. As it was almost noon, <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> held {{straight}} on to Miss Havisham's house. Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands; {{as if he had}} some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{not being}} a {{commercial}} hit, the song has appeared on multiple compilation albums, including Stepping Out: The Very Best of <b>Joe</b> Jackson <b>and</b> This <b>Is</b> It! (The A&M Years 1979-1989). It appeared in live form on the album Live 1980/86.|$|R
6000|$|... "I daren't--I tried," [...] and {{the girl}} quivered in Miss Schuyler's grasp. [...] "If I could have warned him I would not have told you; but <b>Joe</b> saw me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was afraid. I told him to come at nine." ...|$|R
40|$|Names[There were] two {{or three}} {{families}} of Indians, all rejoicing {{in the name of}} Joe.... /occasionally a Joe would drop into our camp... and after consuming enough food for three men and swallowing a few quarts of tea, would say,...

60|$|Joe's forge adjoined our house, {{which was}} a wooden house, {{as many of the}} {{dwellings}} in our country were,--most of them, at that time. When I ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting alone in the kitchen. <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> being fellow-sufferers, and having confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it, sitting in the chimney corner.|$|E
60|$|Joe, who had {{ventured into}} the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us, drew {{the back of his}} hand across his nose with a conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her eyes were withdrawn, {{secretly}} crossed his two forefingers, and exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper. This was so much her normal state, that <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would often, for weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wopsle, {{the clerk}} at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe's uncle, but Mrs. Joe {{appropriated}} him), {{who was a}} well-to-do cornchandler in the nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was half-past one. When <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got home, we found the table laid, and Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked (it never was at any other time) {{for the company to}} enter by, and everything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.|$|E
60|$|He {{did this}} so that nobody but I saw the file; {{and when he}} had done it he wiped the file {{and put it in a}} breast-pocket. I knew it to be <b>Joe's</b> file, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the instrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now {{reclined}} on his settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally about turnips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not just yet, my dear friend," [...] Montague interposed. [...] "It seems a {{shame to}} have taken a dislike to so amiable a gentleman, {{but the fact remains}} that we do not like you, <b>Joe</b> Hartwell <b>and</b> <b>I.</b> Once or twice you have been too clever for us. We want to linger over the time when we are just a little too clever for you. So au revoir, Jacob Pratt, until after lunch." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{downtown}} area, centered {{along and}} around La Grange Road (US 45) and the BNSF Railway line, grew somewhat run-down during the 1980s; however, the mid-to-late 1990s saw a revival, with many new businesses opening including Trader <b>Joe's</b> <b>and</b> Pier <b>I.</b> Many {{of these new}} businesses are restaurants; La Grange draws much of this business from the neighboring town of Western Springs, since Western Springs did not allow the sale of alcoholic beverages in restaurants until recently. In June 2006, animal statues were placed around the downtown area, mimicking the famous Chicago Cows.|$|R
6000|$|The {{sergeant}} took {{a polite}} leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr. Pumblechook {{as from a}} comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman's merits under arid conditions, as when something moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in. Mr. Wopsle, <b>Joe,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> received strict charge to keep in the rear, and to speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably whispered to Joe, [...] "I hope, Joe, we shan't find them." [...] and Joe whispered to me, [...] "I'd give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip." ...|$|E
60|$|The Twichell's {{have been}} here four days {{and we have had}} good times with them. <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> ran over to Homburg, the great {{pleasure}} resort, Saturday, to dine with some friends, and in the morning I went walking in the promenade and met the British Ambassador to the Court of Berlin, and he introduced me to the Prince of Wales, and I found him a most unusually comfortable and unembarrassing Englishman to talk with--quick to see the obscurest point, and equipped with a laugh which is spontaneous and catching. Am invited by a near friend of his to meet him at dinner day after tomorrow, and there could be a good time, but the brass band will smash the talk and spoil everything.|$|E
6000|$|... "About half-past two, <b>Joe</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{drove off}} home with four fine hams {{in the bottom}} of the sleigh, sent by the Major to our mothers. It was a bitter-cold February night, with just light enough to see the road, and splendid sleighing; so we went along at a good pace, till we came to the great woods. They are all gone now, and the woollen mills stand there, but then they were a thick forest of pines, and for more than three miles the road led through them. In former days Indians had lurked there; bears and foxes were still shot, and {{occasionally}} wolves were seen, when cold weather drove them to seek food near the sheep-folds and barn-yards.|$|E
5000|$|... "Joe <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were {{a perfect}} partnership. Apart from the tenseness of those last few months, I {{think we had}} barely two {{disagreements}} {{in all the time}} we worked together. I never for one moment regretted working with <b>Joe</b> Mercer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> know he felt the same way about working with me. We had some fabulous times together and built some fabulous teams. The Mercer-Allison years at Manchester City were the best years of my life. If Joe was still with us today, I think he'd say the same" [...] —Malcolm Allison on Joe Mercer ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless you, no! I only {{fell into}} <b>Joe's</b> arms, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> came to, there the dear fellow was, crying over {{me like a}} baby, while old Sally danced round us like a bedlamite, {{in spite of her}} rheumatics, shouting: 'Hosanna! Thanks and praise! He's come, he's come!'" ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Woman magazine in 2015, Dynevor praised soap writers for reinventing Sally. She said: [...] "After 29 years in Coronation Street, I feel like I'm 'reinventing' Sally a little bit <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really like that. I've had to change with the times, otherwise I'd have been left behind. I'm getting a lot more comedy now, <b>and</b> <b>Joe</b> Duttine Tim <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can't stop laughing - which is great. He's so funny and we work well together." ...|$|R
