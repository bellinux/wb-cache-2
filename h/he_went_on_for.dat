6000|$|... "We'll have to {{get some}} money first," [...] said Tom. [...] "And we can't cable for it, either," [...] <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>for</b> the cable to the Hawaiian Islands from the United States {{had not yet been}} laid.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a {{considerable}} time, with features hardening into intentness and dark eyes scintillating, and {{when at last}} he stopped, Leeson made a sign of concurrence. Then questions were asked and answered, and afterward Forster, who passed the decanter to his guests, stood up.|$|E

50|$|From July 2015 <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> loan <b>for</b> the Ukrainian First League club FC Illichivets Mariupol.|$|R

6000|$|... "First the hosses an' now the stores!" [...] roared Tom Dillon. [...] "Humph! Ye {{deserve to}} be shot full o' holes!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>for</b> {{he had lived in}} the times when the {{stealing}} of a horse, or of a miner's food, was considered by everybody a capital offense.|$|E
60|$|It was {{so perfect}} that {{sometimes}} a strange fear came over him, {{and he did}} not know what to do. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> some years in a sort of trance of activity. What he was doing seemed supreme, he was almost like a divinity. He was a pure and exalted activity.|$|E
60|$|The two trains were at once set in motion. Ronald's party {{met with}} no further {{interruption}} {{until they were}} clear of the bush. As {{soon as he was}} well away from it, he sent back the Rifles to join the other party, and return with them through the forest. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> half a mile further, then halted the waggons and dismounted.|$|E

6000|$|... "Racket!" [...] {{repeated}} Caleb, {{who stood}} beside him. [...] "Why, lad, {{this is nothing}} to what we'll have when we get mixed up. I only hope the commodore signals us to line up for the scrap," [...] <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>for</b> Commodore Schley had left the Brooklyn temporarily, and hoisted his pennant on the Massachusetts. But the signal did not come, much to the old gunner's disappointment.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, we {{will stay}} a while yet," [...] said her uncle. [...] "It may come to that, {{but this is not}} the time. For one season longer let us face--I will not say our enemies; I cannot call anybody my enemy who bears the name of Gresham." [...] And then <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a moment with his breakfast. [...] "So Frank will be here on the 12th?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But, the {{traveller}} {{lost them}} one day, {{as he had}} lost {{the rest of his}} friends, and, after calling to them to come back, which they never did, went on upon his journey. So, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a little while without seeing anything, until at last he came to a middle-aged gentleman. So, he said to the gentleman, [...] "What are you doing here?" [...] And his answer was, [...] "I am always busy. Come and be busy with me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's sixty pound screw," [...] Jimmy answers thoughtfully; [...] "and you mind, master, last March, {{when the}} brindled bull broke out o' the paddock. Two pound you promised me then. And a pound at the dipping. And a pound when Millar's sheep got mixed with ourn;" [...] and so <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on,</b> <b>for</b> bushmen can seldom write, {{but they have}} {{memories}} which nothing escapes.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to play <b>for</b> amateur side Glasgow Hawks.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{this man}} has never said no more about me than he did that first time?' Sally asked. 'Why should <b>he</b> <b>go</b> <b>on</b> paying <b>for</b> me all this time?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Still, one day, in {{the midst}} of all these pleasures, the {{traveller}} lost the boy as he had lost the child, and, after calling to him in vain, went on upon his journey. So <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> a little while without seeing anything, until at last he came to a young man. So, he said to the young man, [...] "What do you do here?" [...] And the young man said, [...] "I am always in love. Come and love with me." ...|$|E
60|$|Night {{had begun}} to close in, for the season had not yet {{advanced}} to the period of endless daylight. Far away in an offshoot vale, a bright ruddy light gleamed through the surrounding darkness. Alric's eye was fixed on it. His untiring foot sped towards it. The roar of a mighty cataract grew louder on his ear every moment. He had to slacken his pace a little, and pick his steps as <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>for</b> the path was rugged and dangerous.|$|E
6000|$|... "What, Prince, {{have you}} nothing to say?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>for</b> Aziel had listened in silence to {{the tale of}} this devilish device. [...] "Well, learn that it depends upon the lady Elissa yonder {{whether or not this}} fate shall be yours. Send now and pray her to save you. Think what it will be to hang as at this moment your servant hangs over that yawning gulf of space, waiting through the long hours till at last you see the little wreaths of smoke begin to curl from the tinder of the cord. Why! before the end found them I have known men go mad, and, like wolves, tear with their teeth at the wooden bars.|$|E
60|$|Colman. When I {{explain it}} to him I am sure he will think well of it; <b>he</b> can't <b>go</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> ever without anyone to listen to him.|$|R
50|$|After football, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to work <b>for</b> {{a finance}} company.|$|R
50|$|Eller {{received}} his Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Whitman College in 1974. <b>He</b> then <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> his Master of Science in Mathematics from the University of Washington.|$|R
60|$|However {{this may}} be, Hannibal became {{a great and}} {{universal}} favorite in the army. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> several years increasing his military knowledge, and widening and extending his influence, when at length, one day, Hasdrubal was suddenly killed by a ferocious native of the country whom he had by some means offended. As soon as the first shock of this occurrence was over, {{the leaders of the}} army went in pursuit of Hannibal, whom they brought in triumph to the tent of Hasdrubal, and instated him at once in the supreme command, with one consent {{and in the midst of}} universal acclamations. As soon as news of this event reached Carthage, the government there confirmed the act of the army, and Hannibal thus found himself suddenly but securely invested with a very high military command.|$|E
60|$|So <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>for</b> an hour, whilst {{the poor}} little King sat and suffered. Then {{all at once}} the old man's frenzy departed, and he became all gentleness. His voice softened, he came down out of his clouds, and fell to prattling along so simply and so humanly, that he soon won the King's heart completely. The old devotee moved the boy nearer to the fire and made him comfortable; doctored his small bruises and {{abrasions}} with a deft and tender hand; and then set about preparing and cooking a supper --chatting pleasantly all the time, and occasionally stroking the lad's cheek or patting his head, in such a gently caressing way that {{in a little while}} all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were changed to reverence and affection for the man.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. The Englishman went on {{for many}} weeks passing but {{disturbed}} evenings and worse nights, and constantly experiencing that those aforesaid windows in the houses of Memory and Mercy rattled after dark, {{and that he had}} very imperfectly nailed them up. Likewise, <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> many weeks daily improving the acquaintance of the Corporal and Bebelle. That is to say, he took Bebelle by the chin, and the Corporal by the hand, and offered Bebelle sous and the Corporal cigars, and even got the length of changing pipes with the Corporal and kissing Bebelle. But he did it all in a shamefaced way, and always took it extremely ill that Monsieur Mutuel in his patch of sunlight should note what he did. Whenever that seemed to be the case, he always growled in his own tongue, [...] "There you are again, walnut-shell! What business is it of yours?" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to play <b>for</b> the Golden State Warriors (2004-January 2005).|$|R
5000|$|... 2nd Day Sequence: That day, <b>he</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> {{assignment}} <b>for</b> {{the arrival}} of Sylvia, a famous Swedish-American actress, at Ciampino airport where she is met by a horde of news reporters.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{just ran}} behind the house--I saw him," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "Did he hurt you any?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> anxiously, <b>for</b> <b>he</b> and Vera and Mary were good friends.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> some days, {{traveling}} by lonely roads through the mountains, until at length he approached a large town. The {{governor of the}} town was a man named Maynard, a near relative of Conrad, {{and it seems that}} in some way or other he had learned that Richard was returning to England, and had reason to suppose that he might endeavor to pass that way. Richard did not think it prudent to attempt to go through the town without a passport, so he sent forward a page whom he had in his party to get one. He gave the page a very valuable ruby ring to present to the governor, directing him {{to say that it was}} a present from a pilgrim merchant, who, with a priest and a few other attendants, was traveling through the country, and wished for permission to go through his town.|$|E
60|$|For {{another five}} minutes Nasmyth spoke {{as he felt}} that he had never spoken before. He was intent and strung up, and he knew that a great deal {{depended}} upon the effect he could make. He had failed with the men of the cities, who wanted all the profit. He felt sure that he would henceforward have one or two of them against him, and {{it was clear that he}} must either abandon his project or win over these hard-handed men of the Bush. With them behind him, there was, he felt, little that he need shrink from attempting. A ring crept into his voice as <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on,</b> <b>for</b> he knew that he was getting hold as he saw their lips set and the resolute expression of their eyes. They were men who, by strenuous toil, wrung a bare living out of the forest, and now there was laid before them a scheme that in its sheer daring seized upon their attention.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> another hour, and the thirst {{increased}} on {{him so that}} {{he thought}} he should be forced to drink. But as he raised the flask he saw a little child lying panting by the roadside, and it cried out piteously for water. Then Gluck struggled with himself and determined to bear the thirst a little longer; and he put the bottle to the child's lips, and it drank it all but a few drops. Then it smiled on him and got up and ran down the hill; and Gluck looked after it till it became as small as a little star, and then turned and began climbing again. And then there were all kinds of sweet flowers growing on the rocks--bright green moss with pale pink, starry flowers, and soft belled gentians, more blue than the sky at its deepest, and pure white transparent lilies. And crimson and purple butterflies darted hither and thither, and the sky sent down such pure light that Gluck had never felt so happy in his life.|$|E
50|$|After leaving Blackpool <b>he</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to play <b>for</b> Newport County and Stalybridge Celtic before {{re-entering}} league football with Watford {{where he}} spent the 1920-21 season. At {{the start of the}} 1921-22 season he joined Stoke and played in the first three matches before leaving Stoke. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to play <b>for</b> Suffolk side Bury St Edmunds.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>went</b> <b>on</b> to play <b>for</b> Brentford, Shrewsbury Town, Swindon Town and Darlington.|$|R
