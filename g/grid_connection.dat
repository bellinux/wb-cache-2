5|$|Most {{stations}} are sited {{within a few}} kilometres of a suitable <b>grid</b> <b>connection</b> point. This network needs {{to be capable of}} absorbing the output of the solar park when operating at its maximum capacity. The project developer will normally have to absorb the cost of providing power lines to this point and making the connection; in addition often to any costs associated with upgrading the grid, so it can accommodate the output from the plant.|$|E
500|$|Major {{milestones}} in {{the development}} of a new photovoltaic power plant are planning consent, [...] <b>grid</b> <b>connection</b> approval, [...] financial close, construction, connection and commissioning.

2500|$|The EEG {{first came}} into force on 1April 2000 and has been {{modified}} several times since. [...] The original legislation guaranteed a <b>grid</b> <b>connection,</b> preferential dispatch, and a government-set feed-in tariff for 20years, dependant on the technology and size of project. [...] The scheme was funded by a surcharge on electricity consumers, with electricity-intensive manufacturers and the railways later being required to contribute as little as 0.05¢/kWh.

50|$|Dump {{charging}} is {{a method}} of charging an electric vehicle's battery pack {{at a higher rate}} than is possible with standard <b>grid</b> <b>connections</b> and battery chargers. High capacity <b>grid</b> <b>connections</b> such as those found at businesses and industry buildings with high demands can also approach these power levels.|$|R
50|$|The fourth issue {{regarding}} {{the generation of}} wind power is the Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff, or REFIT. The purpose of REFIT is to encourage development of renewable energy resources. For wind power production, the current limit to the tariff is 1,450 MW. However, applications currently being processed for <b>grid</b> <b>connections</b> exceed the limit by almost 1,500 MW for a total for nearly 3,000 MW. Since the limit is 1,450 MW, many of the applications for <b>grid</b> <b>connections</b> may not eligible for the tariff.|$|R
40|$|An {{agent-based}} model (ABM) {{is developed}} in Netlogo {{as a tool}} for evaluating temporal diffusion of PV-based communal grids in a rural developing community. ABMs model individual entities within a complex system and the rules that govern the interactions of the entities within the system, to capture the overall effect of such interactions. Results show that given various choices, small PV mircogeneration systems would emerge as the prefered source of electrification for many households. Also, with increasing power demands, many household would prefer communal grids to the national utility grid. Furthermore, introduction of favourable government policies in the form of subsidies and mircocredit facilities, coupled with increasing social acceptance, would lead to increased PV installations and correspondingly to increased communal <b>grid</b> <b>connections.</b> Specifically, introduction of a subsidy of $ 0. 15 /kWh would result in an increase of 249 % in communal <b>grid</b> <b>connections.</b> Increasing the sensing radius from 1 km to 2 km would result in an increase of 118 % in communal <b>grid</b> <b>connections...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Early sets used a {{grid bias battery}} or [...] "C" [...] battery {{which was}} {{connected}} to provide a negative voltage. Since virtually no current flows through a tube's <b>grid</b> <b>connection,</b> these batteries had very low drain and lasted the longest. Even after AC power supplies became commonplace, some radio sets continued to be built with C batteries, as they would almost never need replacing. However more modern circuits were designed using cathode biasing, {{eliminating the need for}} a third power supply voltage; this became practical with tubes using indirect heating of the cathode.|$|E
2500|$|The pioneer EEG (spanning 2001–2014) and its {{predecessor}} the Electricity Feed-in Act (1991) (spanning 1991–2001) class as feed-in tariff (FIT) schemes, a policy mechanism designed {{to accelerate the}} uptake of renewable energy technologies. [...] The scheme offers long-term contracts to renewable energy producers, based {{on the cost of}} generation of the particular technology in question. [...] In addition, a <b>grid</b> <b>connection</b> and preferential dispatch are also guaranteed. [...] The tariffs (Einspeisevergütungen) themselves are funded by a levy or surcharge (EEG-Umlage) on electricity consumers, with electricity-intensive manufacturers being largely exempted. [...] The EEG surcharge is based on the difference between the specified feed-in tariffs paid under the EEG and the sale of the renewable energy at the EEX energy exchange by the grid operators (also known as transmission system operators or TSO). [...] , the TSOs comprise 50Hertz Transmission, Amprion, Tennet TSO, and [...]|$|E

50|$|HVDC {{has been}} chosen {{for most of}} the <b>grid</b> <b>connections</b> because the {{relatively}} long distance involved - both from the wind park to shore and from the shore to the nearest suitable connection point to the onshore grid - makes conventional alternating current transmission uneconomic.|$|R

50|$|In {{situations}} where grid parity has been reached, it becomes cheaper to generate one's own electricity rather than purchasing {{it from the}} grid.
