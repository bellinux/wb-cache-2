I seem {{still to}} hear the brave d'Hautpoul saying to His Majesty, {{just as he was}} {{galloping}} off to charge the enemy: [...] "Sire, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> my big heels; they will go into the enemies' squares as if they were made of butter!" [...] An hour later he was dead. One of his regiments while fighting in an interval of the Russian army, was shot down and cut to pieces by the Cossacks; only eighteen of them escaped. General d'Hautpoul, three times forced to recoil with his division, thrice rallied them to the charge; the third time, he again rushed on the enemy, crying in a loud voice: [...] "Cuirassiers, forward, in the name of God! forward, my brave cuirassiers!" [...] But grapeshot had mowed down too many of these heroes. Very few of them were in condition to follow their leader, who fell, covered with wounds, {{in the middle of a}} Russian square into which he had flung himself almost alone.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{himself had}} to ditch {{into the sea}} on 10April, {{when he was shot}} down after being {{surprised}} by three Zeros during another of his solo reconnaissance missions near Lae. After playing dead beside his crashed plane to discourage the Japanese fighters from machine-gunning him, he swam to shore and made his way through jungle for over a week to Wau, with the help of two New Guinea natives. When he arrived back at Port Moresby in a US Douglas Dauntless on 23April, a Japanese air raid was in progress and a bullet cut off the tip of his right index finger. Having survived his trek through the jungle, he dismissed the wound as [...] "a mere scratch". On 27April, Jackson met with his pilots and revealed that some senior RAAF officers had expressed dissatisfaction with the way in which No.75 Squadron was avoiding dogfighting with the Japanese Zeros. Jackson and his men had generally eschewed such tactics owing to the Zero's superiority to the Kittyhawk in close combat. The senior officers' comments had evidently stung him, however, as he declared to his pilots: [...] "Tomorrow I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how". According to journalist Osmar White, who saw him {{on the night of the}} 27th, Jackson's [...] "hands and eyes were still and rock steady" [...] but he appeared [...] "weary in soul" [...] and [...] "too long in the shadows". White concluded: [...] "He had done more than conquer fear—he had killed it". The next day, Jackson led No.75 Squadron's five remaining airworthy Kittyhawks to intercept a force of Japanese bombers and their escort. He destroyed an enemy fighter before being shot down and killed. His aircraft hit the side of a mountain and embedded itself six feet; Jackson was identified only by his size-ten boots and the revolver he habitually wore. His final tally of aerial victories during the war was eight.|$|E
2500|$|Whedon {{has said}} that the most {{important}} line spoken in the film is when Mal forces the Operative to watch the Miranda footage at the climax of the film, promising him: [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> a world without sin". Whedon makes the point that a world without sin is a world without choice, and that choice is ultimately what defines humanity. [...] According to Whedon, the planet [...] "Miranda" [...] was named for William Shakespeare's Miranda in The Tempest, who in Act V, scene I says: [...] "O brave new world, / That has such people in't!" [...] The Alliance had hoped that Miranda would be a new kind of world, filled with peaceful, happy people, and represents the [...] "inane optimism of the Alliance".|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Daniel Handler {{stated in}} a Bookslut Interview that another film {{was in the}} works, but had been delayed by {{corporate}} shake-ups at Paramount Pictures. In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old. [...] "In an odd way, {{the best thing you}} could do is actually have Lemony Snicket say to the audience, 'Okay, we pawned the first film off as a mere dramatization with actors.

2500|$|According to the prosecution, Knox had {{attacked}} Kercher in her bedroom, repeatedly banged {{her head against}} a wall, forcefully held her face, and tried to strangle her. Mignini suggested Knox had taunted Kercher and may have said, [...] "You acted the goody-goody so much, now we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you.</b> Now you're going {{to be forced to}} have sex!" [...] The prosecution theorized that Guede, Knox, and Sollecito had removed Kercher's jeans, and held her {{on her hands and knees}} while Guede sexually abused her; that Knox had cut Kercher with a knife before inflicting the fatal stab wound; and that she had then stolen Kercher's mobile phones and money to fake a burglary. On 5December 2009, Knox and Sollecito were convicted of murder and sentenced to 26 years' imprisonment.|$|E
2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos telling me to check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, Daniel Handler {{said that}} [...] "a sequel {{does seem to}} be in the works. Paramount has had quite a few {{corporate}} shakeups, which has led to many a delay. Of course, many, many plans in Hollywood come to naught, but I'm assured that another film will be made. Someday. Perhaps." [...] In June 2009, Silberling confirmed he still talked about the project with Handler, and suggested the sequel be a stop motion film because the lead actors have grown too old.

40|$|After {{struggling}} with and against Chaucer {{the other night}} I 2 ̆ 7 m inclined to raise my voice in loud and lusty agreement, {{that the study of}} poetry is difficult. Confound it, at times it seems nearly impossible! There have been nights when I have battled so with evasive symbolism or grasped vainly at some flowery, ethereal imagery, that I have been tempted to rationalize my way out of the whole situation. 2 ̆ 2 Hell, Doc, you can 2 ̆ 7 t let this crazy thing drive you nuts. Besides, it 2 ̆ 7 s just not worth it. Poetry isn 2 ̆ 7 t of any use to you anyway! 2 ̆ 2 Brother, I know just how you feel! But the University requires a certain amount of English Literature before you can scamper cheerfully from the University College into the college of your choice. English Literature includes 2 ̆ 7 poetry and there must be some reason behind it. Now I don 2 ̆ 7 t pretend to know all the answers on this academic system, but {{here are a few of}} my own ideas. I 2 ̆ 7 m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>you</b> how you can practically, get an 2 ̆ 2 A. B. 2 ̆ 2 background by poetry alone...|$|R

60|$|Would we not be happier, we men and women, were we to idealize {{one another}} less? My dear young lady, {{you have nothing}} {{whatever}} to complain to Fate about, I assure you. Unclasp those pretty hands of yours, and come away from the darkening window. Jack {{is as good a}} fellow as you deserve; don't yearn so much. Sir Galahad, my dear--Sir Galahad rides and fights in the land that lies beyond the sunset, far enough away from this noisy little earth where you and I spend much of our time tittle-tattling, flirting, wearing fine clothes, and <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shows.</b> And besides, <b>you</b> must remember, Sir Galahad was a bachelor: as an idealist he was wise. Your Jack {{is by no means a}} bad sort of knight, as knights go nowadays in this un-idyllic world. There is much solid honesty about him, and he does not pose. He is not exceptional, I grant you; but, my dear, have you ever tried the exceptional man? Yes, he is very nice in a drawing-room, and it is interesting to read about him in the Society papers: you will find most of his good qualities there: take my advice, don't look into him too closely. You be content with Jack, and thank heaven he is no worse. We are not saints, we men--none of us, and our beautiful thoughts, I fear, we write in poetry not action. The White Knight, my dear young lady, with his pure soul, his heroic heart, his life's devotion to a noble endeavour, does not live down here to any great extent. They have tried it, one or two of them, and the world--you and I: the world is made up of you and I--has generally starved, and hooted them. There are not many of them left now: do you think you would care to be the wife of one, supposing one were to be found for you? Would you care to live with him in two furnished rooms in Clerkenwell, die with him on a chair bedstead? A century hence they will put up a statue to him, and you may be honoured as the wife who shared with him his sufferings. Do you think you are woman enough for that? If not, thank your stars you have secured, for your own exclusive use, one of us UNexceptional men, who knows no better than to admire you. YOU are not exceptional.|$|R
