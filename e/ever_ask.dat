Although their initial focus was on the bug-ridden release version of The Wolf Age, they also worked to update {{the first two games}} to newer operating systems on both Mac and PC, fix bugs, and create unofficial patches to enhance both the games themselves and the mapmaking tools. They also developed their own library, dubbed the Myth Core Library, which provided networking, input routines, and other low-level functions. This enabled MythDevelopers to avoid the necessity of licensing any external libraries, and instead allowed them to develop everything in-house. This was part of their deal with Take-Two, as they couldn't incorporate anything into the games which they would be unable to give Take-Two the rights to should the company <b>ever</b> <b>ask</b> for the source code back; all modifications remained the intellectual property of Take-Two, who were free to use them in a future commercial version of Myth, if they ever wanted to re-release an upgraded version of {{one or more of the}} games, or incorporate the modifications into the development of a new Myth game.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{mentions}} all [...] "the evils {{out to get}} Rapunzel" [...] and is essentially about manipulating ones' daughter. Featuring [...] "Mommie Dearest-style passive-aggressive putdowns,"|date = January 27, 2011|accessdate = February 24, 2015|website = The Scotsman|last = |first = }} the song begins with Murphy speaking, [...] "You want to go outside? Why, Rapunzel!", and features the lyric [...] "skip the drama, stay with mama," [...] one of the song's most memorable, according to Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times. As Gothel, Murphy lists several things for Rapunzel to fear, such as ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand, cannibals, snakes and the plague, {{in an attempt to}} deter her from leaving. Teena Elizabeth of BookMyShow also observed that at one point the song contradicts itself, with its lyrics first implying that Rapunzel that can leave [...] "soon, but not yet", only to eventually conclude, [...] "Rapunzel will never leave the tower ever." [...] Brian Galindo of BuzzFeed cited [...] "don't <b>ever</b> <b>ask</b> to leave this tower again" [...] as the song's [...] "most villainous lyric." [...] John Roebuck of ReelGood observed that the song's lyrics are essentially [...] "Snide remarks on [...] stolen daughter's appearance and abilities ... disguised as a mothers concern." [...] Writing for Slant Magazine, Christian Blauvelt felt that the song's lyrics were similar to those of [...] "Out There" [...] from Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996), specifically Judge Claude Frollo's verse. Both [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] and [...] "Out There", in fact, were composed by Menken. Also comparing the song to Menken's previous work, AllMusic's James Christopher Monger wrote that [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] is [...] "cut from the same pop cloth as all of the late 20th/early 21st century Disney offerings." ...|$|E
500|$|A [...] "big" [...] musical number, [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] begins {{within the}} first fifteen minutes of Tangled during the film's first act when, {{on the eve of}} her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel finally summons enough courage to ask Gothel for {{permission}} to travel and see the floating lanterns in person. Gothel, whose eternal youth and beauty solely relies on the safety and protection of Rapunzel's magical hair, denies this request by sarcastically reminding her that [...] "mother knows best," [...] warning her ward that [...] "the world is full of wicked people who want to steal her hair's magic," [...] while explaining to her that it's [...] "for her own good," [...] claiming to only want to protect her. At one point during the scene, Gothel actually contradicts herself; Teena Elizabeth of BookMyShow observed, [...] "Gothel has no intentions of letting her go. Though Mother Gothel sings, 'soon, but not yet,' but ironically later says, 'Rapunzel, don't <b>ever</b> <b>ask</b> to leave this tower...again.'" [...] Writing for the Tulsa World, Michael Smith observed that Gothel uses the song [...] "as her lie/rationale for keeping the girl safe (holding her hostage) from those who might steal her for their own hair-inspired profit schemes." [...] Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew felt that the scene is both funny and scary, citing Gothel's [...] "theatrical gestures" [...] and [...] "claustrophobia-inducing stark black backgrounds" [...] as examples of both. [...] "cementing [...] character's ruthlessness," [...] Gothel ultimately orders Rapunzel to promise never to ask permission to leave the tower again. Moviefone's William Goss cited the musical number as an example of [...] "fear-mongering," [...] which has been defined by Dictionary.com as [...] "a person who creates or spreads alarming news." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail penned, [...] "Mother Knows Best hilariously convey the fear and guilt that have kept Rapunzel in the tower of her own free will." [...] In her book Marvels & Tales, author Kendra Magnusson observed that, during the [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] musical sequence, [...] "the manipulation of Rapunzel's hair leaves the heroine's body wrenched in one moment and bound up in it the next", depicting that, while Rapunzel's hair can be used to defend herself, [...] "it is simultaneously a liability" [...] and can just as well be used to harm her.|$|E

2500|$|Alex had a {{vocabulary}} of over 100 words, but was {{exceptional in that}} he appeared to have understanding of what he said. For example, when Alex was shown an object and was asked about its shape, color, or material, he could label it correctly. He could describe a key as a key no matter what its size or color, and could determine how the key was different from others. Looking at a mirror, he said [...] "what color", and learned [...] "grey" [...] after being told [...] "grey" [...] six times. This made him {{the first and only}} non-human animal to have ever asked a question (apes who have been trained to use sign-language have so far failed to <b>ever</b> <b>ask</b> a single question). [...] Alex's ability to ask questions (and to answer to Pepperberg's questions with his own questions) is documented in numerous articles and interviews.|$|E
2500|$|Francesca Bacardi commented for E! Online News, [...] "all of the neons, '80s {{hair and}} dance moves you could <b>ever</b> <b>ask</b> [...].In {{addition}} to Spears looking phenomenal". Whilst noting product placement, Bacardi added [...] "but who cares because it's Britney". Jason Lipshutz for Billboard noted [...] "Spears nods to her classic music video choreography {{with a few}} synchronized moves", adding [...] "there's a lot of Britney Spears dancing in this video, which should absolutely thrill her diehard fans". Nolan Feeney for Time remarked, [...] "Iggy crash-lands in her pool (in a clear nod to the [...] "My Prerogative" [...] video)" [...] before concluding [...] "she [...] hasn’t looked this happy to be dancing in a video in some time". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Christopher Rosen opined [...] "Spears and Azalea don their best valley girl clothes for the video, which also includes a short comedy interlude about Azalea’s [...] "radical alien powers." [...] It’s not as funny as that part in the [...] "Oops!… I Did It Again" [...] video when Spears gets the necklace the old lady dropped in the ocean {{at the end of}} Titanic, but it’ll do". The music video for [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] was also viewed over 100 million times on Vevo, achieving [...] "Vevo Certified" [...] status on July 24, 2015, becoming the fastest video by Spears to reach 100 million views on her channel. It won the fan-voted competition of music videos of 2015 by Fuse.|$|E
2500|$|Although MythDevelopers {{worked to}} update The Fallen Lords and Soulblighter to newer {{operating}} systems on both Mac and PC, fix bugs, and create unofficial patches to enhance both the games {{themselves and the}} mapmaking tools, their initial focus was on the bug-ridden release versions of The Wolf Age, which had problems running on both Windows XP and OS X. Upon getting the code for The Wolf Age, they discovered they [...] "couldn't even build a usable app. We had to rewrite the Mac input routines before we could even make an app." [...] They were also given access to the source code for [...] "BurgerLib", a proprietary development library created by Bill Heineman, lead developer on the Mac version of the game. Additionally, they developed their own library, dubbed the Myth Core Library, which provided networking, input routines, and other low-level functions.

30|$|There was one {{question}} that {{asked me how}} I felt about the way I was communicating with my wife while I was caring for her.
