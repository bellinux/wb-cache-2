5|$|In July 1986, Peterson {{offered a}} free flattop haircut {{to anyone who}} {{attended}} the opening of his third store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson, who got his first flattop haircut in 1952, hired three barbers to give haircuts on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> showrooms. They gave about 50 haircuts the first day, and Peterson {{decided to make the}} gimmick a weekly event. He continued offering the haircuts for two decades and as of 2002 was still giving away about ten haircuts per week.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{monologue}} given by fashion model Agyness Deyn. Scenes of Rihanna with her romantic interest (Dudley O'Shaughnessy) in both love and hate scenarios intersperse, as they experience mounting difficulties in their relationship. After enduring the overwhelming effects of recreational drugs and physical violence, she finds her boyfriend unconscious on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> apartment, and leaves him, having {{had enough of the}} relationship. Images of the song's producer and featured artist Calvin Harris appear in outdoor DJ scenes, while the video has regular references to popular culture, such as themes of films and content of other singers' videos.|$|E
5|$|After {{interrogation}} by Doggett, Purnell {{confesses to}} snatching Billy in 1990 {{on behalf of}} someone else. Doggett recognizes Purnell was also a victim, and with enough prodding, gets a name: Cal Jeppy. The police and the two FBI agents go to Jeppy’s home and find Josh in a compartment under the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> horse trailer. Doggett chases Jeppy into the woods, catches him, and discovers the skull of Billy that Purnell dug up earlier. As the Underwoods stand over the shallow grave of their long dead son, Scully and Doggett discuss the case. Scully believes it was justice from beyond the grave and that {{the important thing is}} that it saved Josh Underwood.|$|E

5000|$|At a {{time when}} many studio {{engineers}} were still wearing white coats and assiduously trying to maintain clarity and fidelity, Meek was producing everything on the three <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> [...] "home" [...] studio and was never afraid to distort or manipulate the sound if it created the effect he was seeking.|$|R
5|$|In April 1839, the {{accusation}} of poisoning the young prince in 1837, {{along with two}} other fabricated cases, was revived against Bhimsen and his party, and forged papers and evidence were produced professing to incriminate him. Bhimsen appealed for justice and tried to defend himself, but the King, blindly believing the forgeries, denounced him as a traitor {{and put him in}} house arrest in a room at the ground <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own Bagh Durbar. Although pardon had already been given, based on these forged evidence, the court physicians, Ekdev and Eksurya Upadhyay were again arrested and tortured. Except for Mathabar Singh, who managed to escape to India, rest of the Thapa family were again arrested, their properties confiscated, were declared outcasts, and were proclaimed to be expelled from every public offices for seven generations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) gives Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) {{an offer to}} become his deputy. Later, Regina (Lana Parrilla) tells Emma that {{she is no longer}} afraid of her staying in the town, and cites Emma's mobile lifestyle. Emma {{encounters}} a 19-year-old pregnant maid named Ashley Boyd (Schram), crying about not having a future for both her and her baby. Emma tells Ashley that she knows how it feels to have a baby at a young age. She encourages Ashley to take charge and change her life. Later that evening, Ashley breaks into Mr. Gold's pawn shop and steals a contract from a safe. While there, she is confronted by Mr. Gold, who attempts to stop her. Ashley attacks him, leaving him unconscious on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> shop.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday morning, Hamilton topped the {{timesheets}} once again, setting {{a time of}} 1:44.352, {{a quarter of a}} second clear of teammate Rosberg. Hülkenberg was third for Force India ahead of Ricciardo and Vettel. The session saw several incidents: Bottas damaged the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car when he ran over a drain cover on his installation lap and was forced to miss the rest of the session; Felipe Massa made contact with the wall, but was later able to rejoin practice; Räikkönen's track time was limited as well due to a loss of power; and a red flag period occurred right after the chequered flag fell as Pérez crashed at turn 15.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1219 and 1221, Persia was raided by the Mongols. After 1260, {{the title}} [...] "Ilkhan" [...] was {{borne by the}} {{descendants}} of Hulagu Khan and later other Borjigin princes in Persia. At {{the end of the}} thirteenth century, Ghazan Khan built a new capital at Shãm, near Tabriz. He ordered the <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> residence to be covered with carpets from Fārs.|$|R

5|$|Jones is {{approached}} by greaser Mutt Williams, who {{tells him that}} Harold Oxley had found a crystal skull in Peru, suffered a mental breakdown and was later kidnapped. Jones tells Mutt about the legend of crystal skulls found in Akator. Mutt gives Jones a letter from his mother, who is also held captive, containing a riddle written by Oxley in an ancient South American language. KGB agents attempt to capture them, but Jones and Mutt escape them and reach Peru. At the local psychiatric hospital, Oxley's scribbles {{on the walls and}} <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cell lead them to the grave of Francisco de Orellana, a Conquistador who searched for Akator. They discover the skull at the grave, with Jones reasoning that Oxley had returned it there.|$|E
5|$|The young William showed artistic promise from {{an early}} age, drawing in chalk on the wooden <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father's shop. From the age of four he {{attended}} local schools in York, before being sent {{at the age of}} 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a boarding school in nearby Pocklington, which he left two years later. On 8October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of Hull, publisher of the Hull Packet. While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books. It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise {{for the first time that}} it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting.|$|E
5|$|By about 05:00, Dyck's {{ammunition}} {{supplies were}} running low, and the ZIPRA attackers {{had hit the}} Alamo {{a number of times}} with RPG fire. Nobody inside was killed by these rockets, but when Dyck's dog was wounded, the major flew into a rage and ordered his men to pour more aggressive machine gun fire on the advancing ZIPRA combatants. He requested air support from Brigade HQ {{in the form of a}} Lynx light bomber. The air force turned down the request, but Flight Lieutenant Colin James took off anyway in his Lynx armed with an FN MAG machine gun and SNEB rockets. The ZIPRA cadres concentrated a huge amount of fire on James' aircraft, and hit it several times, but failed to shoot it down; the pilot put in a number of ground attacks before returning to base. He reported afterwards that a bullet had entered through the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cockpit and hit his helmet. The 1RAR officers and men expressed great admiration for James's bravery during this air strike, but his air force superiors were furious that he had gone into the operational area against orders.|$|E
5000|$|According to Dr. George Kelley, {{his passion}} for {{collecting}} pulp fiction emerged in his adolescence after his mother had disposed <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personal collection <b>of</b> over 1000 comic books. [...] Dr. George Kelley admits {{that he decided to}} donate the collection to University at Buffalo, after receiving an ultimatum from his wife. The weight from the collection had reportedly begun to damage the <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> residence. [...] Every work in the collection continues to be housed in the original Ziploc bag it was placed in when Dr. George Kelley added them to the collection.|$|R
50|$|Goofy enters home tired after a {{hard day}} at work. Exhausted, he {{suddenly}} notices an exercise advertisement in his newspaper. He orders gymnastics equipment and with the aid of an instruction record he tries out using the barbells, the chin-up bars and cable expanders, all of which meet with disastrous results. Goofy destroys the <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> apartment in the process and flies out of the window before he is swung back against the muscular chart <b>of</b> <b>his</b> equipment. While he stands behind the cardboard muscular man he is glad that he finally resembles a muscular man.|$|R
50|$|The {{hotel was}} {{attacked}} on 29 June 1914, during Anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo. Soon afterwards, with Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia {{and with the}} conflict expanding into World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Army occupied part of Hotel Evropa by the joint decision of the government's Sarajevo trustee and the Sarajevo Fortress military command. In late October 1914, Gliša Jeftanović received a cable from the Sarajevo vice-mayor Damjanović, informing him about the minimal compensation he would be receiving for k. und k. officers and soldiers using the first two <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hotel.|$|R

25|$|By 20 July 1942 Bryks {{had been}} {{transferred}} to Oflag VI-A near Soest in Westphalia. From 12 August he was held in solitary confinement, but fellow-prisoners smuggled razor blades to him hidden inside bread.

On 17 August he escaped through the tunnel, wearing only pyjamas, a sweater and a blanket.|$|E
25|$|After leaving college, Blount {{became known}} as the most {{singularly}} devoted musician in Birmingham. He rarely slept, citing Thomas Edison, Leonardo da Vinci, and Napoleon as fellow highly productive cat-nappers. He transformed the first <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> family's home into a conservatory-workshop, where he wrote songs, transcribed recordings, rehearsed with the many musicians who drifted in and out, and discussed Biblical and esoteric concepts with whoever was interested.|$|E

500|$|However the feud quickly {{restarted}} as Mahoney {{criticized the}} design of The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton's lower floors. The bulky floors were designed to contain a grand ballroom, health club, and 540-car parking garage. Mahoney says the design would unnecessarily lower {{the values of the}} condominiums on 21 <b>of</b> the lower <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> building. Further redesigns to both buildings prevented any condominiums from facing a garage. However the feud continued with lively arguments to block each other plans in courtrooms and Philadelphia city agencies. Chairman of the zoning board, David L. Auspitz, called the feud the [...] "Super Bowl of zoning battles".|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to other engineers working in reinforced concrete, Cottancin {{did not see}} the material in terms of the actions, tension and compression of the component materials.Instead, he viewed the sheets of reinforced concrete used for the walls and <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> buildings as a monolithic material in its response to stress.Cottancin's woven mesh may be viewed as a precursor to modern welded sheets of steel fabric.However, Cottancin's system was less practical than the béton armé technique of François Hennebique, perfected in 1897, which became standard practice after Paul Christophe published Le béton armé et ses applications in 1902.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Dr Casriel had {{extended}} his private practice {{to include a}} small therapeutic community on the top four <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> office building.

It consisted {{of about a dozen}} beds for young addicts who came to live, [...] "work" [...] and participate in the [...] "New Identity Process". When Casriel died in 1983, former patient Steven Yohay expanded the program and became president of AREBA Casriel, Inc., today the oldest surviving private addiction treatment centre in the United States.|$|R
25|$|Another {{developing}} arts {{district in}} Memphis is Broad Avenue.

Odessa, another art space on Broad Avenue, hosts student art shows and local electronic music. Other gallery spaces spring up for semi-annual artwalks.|$|E
25|$|In 1940, the Germans invaded Norway and the Nazi party {{took over}} the government. Munch was 76 years old. With nearly an entire {{collection}} of his art in the second <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> house, Munch lived in fear of a Nazi confiscation. Seventy-one of the paintings previously taken by the Nazis had been returned to Norway through purchase by collectors (the other eleven were never recovered), including The Scream and The Sick Child, and they too were hidden from the Nazis.|$|E

Following a temporary postponement of the excavations imposed in January 1979 because of a severe winter snowfall in Chicago, excavations of the property resumed in March—despite Gacy's insistence to investigators that all the victims' bodies buried upon his property had been found.|$|E
5000|$|Horten's {{dark brown}} {{interiors}} {{morphed into a}} more modern and fresh look {{with the introduction of}} the new Galeria stores in the 1980s, with an emphasis on lighter colors such as blue, light gray and white.
