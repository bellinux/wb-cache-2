30|$|The {{treatment}} {{generates a}} film at the papers’ surface. The overall optical impression {{is closely related}} to the amount of nanocellulose applied: From approximately 2 % nanocellulose, slight (BNC) or very slight (NFC) hazes are clearly visible and become much more apparent with increasing amounts. Thus, letters appear more veiled with 8 % NFC or 15 % BNC. The signs of BNC look shinier when a higher amount is applied, whereas the films of NFC occur more as matt, white hazes without gloss. This is an important advantage of NFC. Besides the amount applied, the gloss with BNC is increased by using the <b>film</b> <b>applicator.</b>|$|E

30|$|Polycaprolactone (PCL) {{films were}} {{prepared}} by solution casting method. Five gram of the PCL pellets were dissolved in 40  ml of dichloromethane {{to form the}} PCL solution. The polymer solution was then cast onto the glass substrate with predetermined thickness using the automatic <b>film</b> <b>applicator</b> (PA- 2105, BYK). The solvent was removed at room temperature by slow evaporation over a 24 -h period, and was further dried in a vacuum oven for another 24  h at 35  °C to obtain translucent PCL films with a thickness of about 150  μm. The resultant pristine PCL films were cut into round-shaped specimens with a diameter of 2  cm, followed by washing with copious amount of deionized water and isopropanol.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{adhesive}} layer thickness and drug loading on estradiol crystallization were studied in a drug-in-adhesive patch. Patches containing different estradiol loadings (1. 1 % and 1. 6 % w/w) in different thicknesses (45, 60, and 90  μm) were prepared by coating of a homogenous mixture of adhesive solution {{and the drug}} on a siliconized release liner by a <b>film</b> <b>applicator.</b> After drying, the film was laminated on a Poly(ethylene terephthalate) backing layer and cut into appropriate size. Release tests were performed using thermostated Chien-type diffusion cells. Cross-section of the patches was observed by optical microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was done for surface analysis of the patches after drug release test. Crystal formation was not expected in the adhesive layer based on the linear free-energy relationship formalisms however; crystalline regions were observed in different locations through {{the thickness of the}} patches. These regions were significantly more discontinuous in 45  μm samples which elucidated the effective role of adhesive layer thickness in drug crystallization. Extensive crystallization observed for thicker patches was attributed to the strong crosslinking capability of estradiol hemihydrate. Drug release study confirmed some of the crystallization results. No significant increase was observed in the burst release with increasing in thickness from 45 to 60  μm which {{can be attributed to the}} severe increase in the crystallization extent.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Chemical Engineering, İzmir, 2003 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 64 - 66) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishx, 66 leavesIn this study, transport {{properties of}} methyl methacrylate (MMA) monomer in methylmethacrylate. butylacrylate copolymer were measured using a gravimetric sorption technique. This copolymer {{is used as}} a binder in indoor and outdoor paint formulation. Following the application of the paint material, residual monomers (volatile organic compounds, VOC) are emitted over time. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} and determine emission characteristics of residual monomers in order to evaluate their impact on the indoor air quality. With the growing awareness of the problems associated with the indoor air quality, there is now strong pressure for manufacturing, and selecting paint materials as well as other building materials with low VOC emissions. Success in both manufacturing and choosing environmentally friendly building materials is greatly facilitated by the availability of mathematical models for predicting the emission rates of VOCs from these materials. Emission rates of monomers, VOCs, from paint and other building materials are primarily governed by the diffusion within the material. The key parameter required to predict emission rates is the diffusion coefficient of monomers within the polymer. In addition, the knowledge of diffusivity of monomers in the polymer is prerequisite in the design of a devolatilization unit to produce paint materials with reduced monomer contents. In accordance with these concerns, the second objective of this study was to derive a physical model to predict the emission characteristics of the MMA from the paint material using experimentally determined diffusivity and solubility data. As a first step in the experimental study, MMA-BA copolymer sample was characterized to determine its glass transition temperature, degradation temperature, functional groups and composition using thermal analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis techniques. Samples were provided by Organic Kimya A. Ş. in the form of an emulsion and films were prepared using a <b>film</b> <b>applicator.</b> Final characterization of the samples was done by observing microstructure of the films and measuring the thickness using a scanning electron microscope. Diffusivity and solubilities were measured over a temperature range of 40 oC to 60 oC by a new type of gravimetric sorption apparatus called magnetic suspension balance. In order to determine concentration dependence of the diffusivities, monomer temperature was increased with small step changes. Diffusivity of MMA in MMA-BA copolymer varied in the range of 1 x 10 - 8 - 1 x 10 - 7 cm 2 /s as the weight fraction of MMA increased from 0. 03 to 0. 2. The most popular theory derived by Vrentas and Duda was successfully used to correlate the diffusivity data of the MMA as a function of temperature and concentration. The free volume parameters were obtained by rheological measurements and with the use of limited diffusion data. Based on these parameters, the predictive ability of the model was found to be satisfactory. The solubility data were accurately modeled by Flory Huggins thermodynamic theory. The Flory Huggins interaction parameter determined as 0. 726 indicated that MMA cannot completely dissolve the copolymer. According to the prediction of this theory, maximum amount of MMA which can be absorbed in the copolymer is around 53 % by volume. In the second part of this study, the physical model derived was used to predict MMA concentration in air under different conditions. Model predictions have shown that increasing air exchange rate significantly reduce the concentration of MMA in air. If the exchange rate is not changed, increasing air velocity or temperature causes an increase in MMA concentration in air. In all cases, at long emission times concentration of MMA in the paint material does not change significantly indicating that transport of MMA is controlled by diffusion in the paint material...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do presente trabalho foi caracterizar as propriedades superficiais de filmes à base de gelatina. Para o qual foram elaborados filmes de: (i) Gelatina plastificado com glicerol (G) (gelatina: 5 g/ 100 g SFF; glicerol: 30 g/ 100 g de gelatina), (ii) Gelatina reforçado com montmorilhonita (G/MMT) (gelatina: 5 g/ 100 g SFF; glicerol: 30 g/ 100 g de gelatina; MMT: 5 g/ 100 g de gelatina) e Gelatina plastificado com citrato de acetiltributila (G/ATB) (gelatina: 5 g/ 100 g SFF; ATB: 50 g/ 100 de gelatina; lecitina de soja: 60 g/ 100 g de ATB; etanol: 20 g/ 100 g SFF). Os filmes foram produzidos mediante o uso de um aplicador automático de filmes S̈preading. ̈ Logo, os filmes foram submetidos a testes para determinação da espessura, umidade e propriedades óticas (brilho, cor e opacidade). Também foi caracterizada a microestrutura por microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV) e microscopia de força atômica (AFM); às imagens obtidas por MEV foi aplicado um analise de imagem mediante o programa Image J, para obter o valor da dimensão fractal (DF). Depois foram caracterizadas as propriedades superficiais de ângulo de contato (AC), molhabilidade ou coeficiente de espalhamento (Se), e energia livre {{superficial}} (ELS) mediante a medida do ângulo de contato pelo método da gota séssil (água: 5 µL e 1 -Bromonaftaleno: 3 µL). Para o cálculo da ELS também foi aplicado o método de Owens-Wendt. Estas caracterizações foram feitas em ambos os lados do filme, lado ar e lado placa. A natureza do filme de G/ATB influenciou na umidade e as propriedades óticas, enquanto que os filmes de G e G/MMT apresentaram características similares. Em relação à microestrutura e rugosidade, o filme de G apresentou a superfície mais homogênea e lisa, contrario ao observado no filme de G/MMT, que apresentou a maior rugosidade seguida do filme de G/ATB. Foi observado que houve uma relação entre os valores de rugosidade e DF. De acordo com o valor do AC, os filmes apresentaram um caráter hidrofóbico, pois seus valores foram superiores a 65 ° (em ambos os lados dos filmes), na seguinte ordem: G/MMT > G > G/ATB; sendo que o Se seguiu a mesma tendência. Cabe mencionar também que não foi encontrada uma correlação significativa entre os valores de AC e rugosidade. Em função dos valores de AC, Se e ELS (especificamente a componente polar), o filme de G/ATB apresentou o menor caráter hidrofóbico, pois apresentou menores valores de AC e maiores valores de Se em comparação com os outros dois filmes. Os valores da componente polar da G/ATB foram os maiores, explicando de melhor maneira o caráter menos hidrofóbico deste filme. Pode-se concluir que os filmes à base de gelatina elaborados no presente trabalho têm propriedades hidrofóbicas (AC> 65 °), sendo a G/MMT o filme com melhores características hidrofóbicas. The aim of {{this study}} was to characterize the surface properties of gelatin-based films. For which, films were produced as following: gelatin plasticized with glycerol (gelatin: 5 g/ 100 g SFF; glycerol: 30 g/ 100 g of gelatin), gelatin reinforced with montmorillonite (gelatin: 5 g/ 100 g SFF; glycerol: 30 g/ 100 of gelatin; montmorillonite: 5 g/ 100 g of gelatin), and gelatin plasticized with acetyltributyl citrate (gelatin: 5 g/ 100 g SFF; acetyltributyl citrate: 50 g/ 100 of gelatin, soy lecithin: 60 g/ 100 g acetyltributyl citrate; ethanol: 20 g/ 100 g SFF). The films were produced by using an automatic <b>film</b> <b>applicator</b> S̈preading. ̈ Then, the films were tested for determining thickness, humidity and optical property (gloss, color and opacity). Also the microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM); in the images obtained by SEM it was applied image analysis using Image J program, to get the value of the fractal dimension (FD). After, the surface properties of contact angle (CA), wettability or spreading coefficient (Cs) and surface free energy (SFE) were characterized by measuring the contact angle by the method of the sessile drop (water: 5 µL, 1 -Bromonaphthalene: 3 µL). For the calculation of the ELS, it was also applied the method of Owens-Wendt. These characterizations were made on both sides of the film (air side and plate side). The nature of the G/ATB film influenced the moisture and optical properties, while the films of G and G/MMT showed similar values. With regard to microstructure and roughness, the G film presented a more homogeneous and smooth surface, contrary to that was observed in films of G/MMT, who presented the highest roughness followed by G/ATB film. It was observed that there was a relationship between the roughness values and DF. According to the value of the CA, the three films had a hydrophobic character, because their values were above 65 ° (on both sides of the film), in the following order: G/MMT > G > G/ATB; the Cs followed the same trend. It should be also mentioned that a significant correlation between the values of CA and the roughness was found. According to the values of CA, Cs and SFE (specifically the polar component), the films of G/ATB had the lowest hydrophobicity, because had lower CA values and higher Cs values, as compared to the other two films. The values of the polar component of the film G/ATB were higher, which explains better the less hydrophobic character of this film. It can be concluded that the gelatin-based films produced in this work have hydrophobic properties (CA> 65 °), being the film G/MMT which showed better hydrophobic characteristics...|$|E
