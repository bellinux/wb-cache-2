25|$|Eicosanoid {{biosynthesis}} {{begins when}} a cell is activated by mechanical trauma, ischemia, other physical perturbations, attack by pathogens, or stimuli made by nearby cells, tissues, or pathogens such as chemotactic factors, cytokines, growth factors, and even certain eicosanoids. The activated cells then mobilize enzymes, termed phospholipase A2's (PLA2s), capable of releasing ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids from membrane storage. These fatty acids are bound in <b>ester</b> <b>linkage</b> to the SN2 position of membrane phospholipids; PLA2s act as esterases {{to release the}} fatty acid. There are several classes of PLA2s with type IV cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2s) appearing {{to be responsible for}} releasing the fatty acids under many conditions of cell activation. The cPLA2s act specifically on phospholipids that contain AA, EPA or GPLA at their SN2 position. Interestingly, cPLA2 may also release the lysophospholipid that becomes platelet-activating factor.|$|E
25|$|Choline in food {{exists in}} either a free or esterified form (choline bound within another compound, such as phosphatidylcholine, through an <b>ester</b> <b>linkage).</b> Although all forms are most likely usable, some {{evidence}} indicates they are unequally bioavailable (able {{to be used by}} the body). Lipid-soluble forms (such as phosphytidylcholine) bypass the liver once absorbed, while water-soluble forms (such as free choline) enter the liver portal circulation and are generally absorbed by the liver. Both pregnancy and lactation increase demand for choline dramatically. This demand may be met by upregulation of PEMT via increasing estrogen levels to produce more choline de novo, but even with increased PEMT activity, the demand for choline is still so high that bodily stores are generally depleted. This is exemplified by the observation that Pemt -/- mice (mice lacking functional PEMT) will abort at 9–10 days unless fed supplemental choline.|$|E
500|$|Eukaryotic cells feature {{compartmentalized}} membrane-bound organelles {{that carry}} out different biological functions. The glycerophospholipids {{are the main}} structural component of biological membranes, such as the cellular plasma membrane and the intracellular membranes of organelles; in animal cells, the plasma membrane physically separates the intracellular components from the extracellular environment. The glycerophospholipids are amphipathic molecules (containing both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions) that contain a glycerol core linked to two fatty acid-derived [...] "tails" [...] by ester linkages and to one [...] "head" [...] group by a phosphate <b>ester</b> <b>linkage.</b> While glycerophospholipids are the major component of biological membranes, other non-glyceride lipid components such as sphingomyelin and sterols (mainly cholesterol in animal cell membranes) are also found in biological membranes. In plants and algae, the galactosyldiacylglycerols, and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol, which lack a phosphate group, are important components of membranes of chloroplasts and related organelles and are the most abundant lipids in photosynthetic tissues, including those of higher plants, algae and certain bacteria.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemical}} structure was initially characterized {{through a combination}} of IR spectroscopy, hydrogen-1 NMR, carbon-13 NMR, and 2D NMR spectra data, and the crystal structure of balanol in complex with PKA was solved in 1999. The balanol molecule consists of three regions: a benzophenone, hexahydroazepane, and 4-hydroxy benzoyl moiety. The benzophenone and hexahydroazepane moieties are connected via an <b>ester</b> <b>linkage,</b> and the azepane and benzoyl moieties are connected through an amide linkage. Furthermore, balanol is sometimes referred to as ophiocordin, an antifungal agent produced by the fungus Cordyceps ophioglossoides whose structure is regioisometric to that of balanol; that is, in ophiocordin, the benzophenone is linked to the hexahydroazepane instead via an amide; the 4-hydroxy benzoyl group and hexahydroazepane are connected with an <b>ester</b> <b>linkage.</b>|$|E

40|$|The surface {{modification}} of inorganic materials with organic units {{is an important}} process in device preparation. For the modification of TiO 2, organocarboxylic acids (RCO 2 H) are usually used. Carboxylic acids form <b>ester</b> <b>linkages</b> (RCO 2 Ti) with hydroxyl groups on the TiO 2 surface to attach the organic groups on the surface. However, the esterification liberates water as a byproduct, which may contaminate the surface by affecting TiO 2 electronic states.
