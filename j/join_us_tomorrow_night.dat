50|$|This nude {{is painted}} in a {{somewhat}} awkward studio pose. The sitter has been identified (but without certainty) as Mademoiselle Rose, an artists' model who according to Alfred Robaut, Delacroix's biographer, posed several times for him and for Richard Parkes Bonington, and who perhaps distributed her favours impartially between the two artists. In {{a letter to his}} friend Pierret, usually dated 1820, Delacroix wrote: I had tried to persuade Felix (Guillemardet) to come and <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>tomorrow,</b> but he said that the shortage of money had got the better of Mademoiselle Rose's bottom on this occasion.This particular nude is represented with an almost naturalistic sincerity, without any decorative arrangement. Although it already displays the variations of light on flesh which interested the artist so deeply, the pigment, applied in masterly touches in a granular impasto, has not yet acquired the fluidity which was to owe to the influence of English painting. This first made itself felt at the salon of 1824, where Delacroix saw works by John Constable, and increased in 1825, the date of his visit to London.|$|R
50|$|J: First and third. Tying run at third, {{winning run}} at first, two out, the pitch! a swing and a...foul tip, {{he just got}} {{a piece of it}} and that's how close Boston was to nailing it down. A foul by Mookie Wilson keeps him up there. two balls two strikes. The Mets have scored here in the tenth, they trail 5-4 trying to send <b>us</b> into <b>tomorrow</b> <b>night.</b> Here's the pitch! Swing and a foul, back and out of play and Wilson {{hammered}} at one outside, in the strike zone I think, stays 2-2. Mitchell the tying run at third, a base hit ties it for New York, a long one could win it, a home run would win it, the pitch! Ball three! Wild pitch! We're gonna be tied! The ball went off the glove of the catcher. We're 5-5 {{in the bottom of the}} tenth. Unbelievable, it's 5-5 and now the winning run is at second with two out. A breaking ball handcuffed Gedman, a breaking ball handcuffed the catcher and Mitchell raced home with the tying run and Mookie Wilson could win it here. They have a base open and Howard Johnson up next. That run charged to Schiraldi. The 3-2 pitch on the way, swing and a high pop foul going out of play. And it gives everybody a chance to collect their collective breath as the Mets have scored two here in the tenth after scoring a run in the eighth to pull it out of the bag again.|$|R
