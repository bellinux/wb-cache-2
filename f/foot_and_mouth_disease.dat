Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E

The treatment is mainly supportive with aggressive cardiopulmonary resuscitation. We report the use of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration in a patient with pulmonary edema and shock due to enterovirus 71 infection. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report of the use of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration to successfully treat a patient with fulminant cardiopulmonary failure due to enterovirus 71 infection. Case presentation A 36 -month-old Asian girl presented to our hospital with pulmonary edema, refractory hypotension and severe cardiac dysfunction due to enterovirus 71 infection. In addition to the standard management and care, we performed continuous veno-venous hemofiltration to overcome refractory shock and our patient eventually made a full recovery. At a three-month follow-up, a full assessment revealed no neurological sequelae. Conclusions In the management of patients with enterovirus 71 -related fulminant cardiopulmonary failure, early continuous veno-venous hemofiltration may be considered as an alternative treatment to improve patient survival and to prevent severe neurological disabilities. </p...|$|R

Effective medications and prophylactic vaccine against EV 71 infection are urgently needed. Based {{on the success of}} inactivated poliovirus vaccine, a prototype chemically inactivated EV 71 vaccine candidate has been developed and currently in human phase 1 clinical trial. Principal Finding: In this report, we present the development of a serum-free cell-based EV 71 vaccine. The optimization at each step of the manufacturing process was investigated, characterized and quantified. In the up-stream process development, different commercially available cell culture media either containing serum or serum-free was screened for cell growth and virus yield using the roller-bottle technology. VP-SFM serum-free medium was selected based on the Vero cell growth profile and EV 71 virus production. After the up-stream processes (virus harvest, diafiltration and concentration), a combination of gel-filtration liquid chromatography and/or sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation down-stream purification processes were investigated at a pilot scale of 40 liters each. Although the combination of chromatography and sucrosegradient ultracentrifugation produced extremely pure EV 71 infectious virus particles, the overall yield of vaccine was 7 – 10 % as determined by a VP 2 -based quantitative ELISA. Using chromatography as the downstream purification, the virus yield was 30 – 43 %.

A formalin-inactivated EV 71 candidate vaccine (EV 71 vac) based on B 4 subgenotype has previously been developed and found to elicit strong neutralizing antibody responses in mice and humans. In this study, we evaluated the long-term immunogenicity and safety of this EV 71 vac in a non-human primate model. Juvenile macaques were immunized at 0, 3 and 6 weeks either with 10 or 5 µg doses of EV 71 vac formulated with AlPO 4 adjuvant, or PBS as control. During the 56 weeks of studies, no fever nor local redness and swelling at sites of injections was observed in the immunized macaques. After single immunization, 100 % seroconversion based on 4 -fold increased in neutralization titer (Nt) was detected in EV 71 vac immunized monkeys but not PBS controls. A dose-dependent IgG antibody response was observed in monkeys receiving EV 71 vac immunization. The Nt of EV 71 vac immunized macaques had reached the peak after 3 vaccinations, then decreased gradually; however, the GMT of neutralizing antibody in the EV 71 vac immunized macaques were still above 100 {{at the end of}} the study. Correspondingly, both dose- and time-dependent interferon-γ and CD 4 + T cell responses were detected in monkeys receiving EV 71 vac.

In addition, strong cross-neutralizing antibodies against most EV 71 subgenotypes except some C 2 and C 4 b strains, and Coxsackievirus A 16 were observed.

Diseases recorded to be carried by wolves include rabies, brucella, deerfly fever, listeriosis, <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>disease</b> and anthrax. Wolves are major hosts for rabies in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and India. Wolves in Russia have been recorded to carry over 50 different kinds of harmful parasites. A 10-year study in the former Soviet Union showed that in some regions, every successful wolf litter in spring coincided with a 100% increase in cestode infections in moose and wild boar, with some specimen having up to 30-40 cysts. It also showed that where wolves were absent, the number of cysticerosis infected wild ungulates was much less. Despite their habit of carrying harmful diseases, large wolf populations are not negatively influenced by epizootic outbreaks as with other canids, and thus some hunting proponents argue that disease cannot be a guarantee of naturally controlling wolf numbers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background China Centre for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) {{developed}} the China Infectious Disease Automated Alert and Response System (CIDARS) in 2005. The CIDARS {{was used to}} strengthen infectious disease surveillance and aid in the early warning of outbreak. The CIDARS has been integrated into the routine outbreak monitoring efforts of the CDC at all levels in China. Early warning threshold is crucial for outbreak detection in the CIDARS, but CDCs at all level are currently using thresholds recommended by the China CDC, and these recommended thresholds have recognized limitations. Our study therefore seeks to explore an operational method to select the proper early warning threshold according to the epidemic features of local infectious diseases. Methods The data {{used in this study}} were extracted from the web-based Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System (NIDRIS), and data for infectious disease cases were organized by calendar week (1 – 52) and year (2009 – 2015) in Excel format; Px was calculated using a percentile-based moving window (moving window [5  week* 5  year], x), where x represents one of 12 centiles (0. 40, 0. 45, 0. 50 …. 0. 95). Outbreak signals for the 12 Px were calculated using the moving percentile method (MPM) based on data from the CIDARS. When the outbreak signals generated by the ‘mean +  2 SD’ gold standard were in line with a Px generated outbreak signal for each week during the year of 2014, this Px was then defined as the proper threshold for the infectious disease. Finally, the performance of new selected thresholds for each infectious disease was evaluated by simulated outbreak signals based on 2015 data. Results Six infectious diseases were selected in this study (chickenpox, mumps, hand <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>diseases</b> (HFMD), scarlet fever, influenza and rubella). Proper thresholds for chickenpox (P 75), mumps (P 80), influenza (P 75), rubella (P 45), HFMD (P 75), and scarlet fever (P 80) were identified. The selected proper thresholds for these 6 infectious diseases could detect almost all simulated outbreaks within a shorter time period compared to thresholds recommended by the China CDC. Conclusions It is beneficial to select the proper early warning threshold to detect infectious disease aberrations based on characteristics and epidemic features of local diseases in the CIDARS...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hand, <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>diseases</b> (HFMD) {{caused by}} {{enterovirus}} 71 (EV 71) presents {{a broad spectrum}} of clinical manifestations ranging from mild febrile disease to fatal neurolocal disease. However, the mechanism of virulence is unknown. METHODS: We isolated 6 strains of EV 71 from HFMD patients with or without neurological symptoms, and sequenced the whole genomes of the viruses to reveal the virulence factors of EV 71. RESULTS: Phylogenetic tree based on VP 1 region showed that all six strains clustered into C 4 a of C 4 sub-genotype. In the complete polypeptide, 298 positions were found to be variable in all strains, and three of these positions (Val(P 814) /Ile(P 814) in VP 1, Val(P 1148) /Ile(P 1148) in 3 A and Ala(P 1728) /Cys) /Val(P 1728) in 3 C) were conserved among the strains with neurovirulence, but variable in strains without neurovirulence. In the 5 '-UTR region, it showed that the first 10 nucleotides were mostly conserved, however from the 11 th nucleotide, nucleotide insertions and deletions were quite common. The secondary structure prediction of 5 '-UTR sequences showed that two of three strains without neurovirulence (SDLY 11 and SDLY 48) were almost the same, and all strains with neurovirulence (SDLY 96, SDLY 107 and SDLY 153) were different from each other. SDLY 107 (a fatal strain) was found different from other strains on four positions (C(P 241) /T(P 241), A(P 571) /T(P 571), C(P 579) /T(P 579) in 5 '-UTR and T(P 7335) /C(P 7335) in 3 '-UTR). CONCLUSIONS: The three positions (Val(P 814) /Ile(P 814) in VP 1, Val(P 1148) /Ile(P 1148) in 3 A and Ala(P 1728) /Cys(P 1728) /Val(P 1728) in 3 C), were different between two phenotypes. These suggested that the three positions might be potential virulent positions. And the three varied positions were also found to be conserved in strains with neurovirulence, and variable in strains without neurovirulence. These might reveal that the conservation of two of the three positions or the three together were specific for the strains with neurovirulence. Varation of secondary structure of 5 '-UTR, might be correlated to the changes of viral virulence. SDLY 107 (a fatal strain) was found different from other strains on four positions, these positions might be related with death...|$|R

40|$|Enterovirus 71 (EV 71) {{is one of}} {{the main}} causative agents of <b>foot,</b> hand <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>disease.</b> Its {{infection}} usually causes severe central nervous system diseases and complications in infected infants and young children. In the present study, we demonstrated that EV 71 infection caused the rearrangement of vimentin in human astrocytoma cells. The rearranged vimentin, together with various EV 71 components, formed aggresomes-like structures in the perinuclear region. Electron microscopy and viral RNA labeling indicated that the aggresomes were virus replication sites since most of the EV 71 particles and the newly synthesized viral RNA were concentrated here. Further analysis revealed that the vimentin in the virus factories was serine- 82 phosphorylated. More importantly, EV 71 VP 1 protein is responsible for the activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK-II) which phosphorylated the N-terminal domain of vimentin on serine 82. Phosphorylation of vimentin and the formation of aggresomes were required for the replication of EV 71 since the latter was decreased markedly after phosphorylation was blocked by KN 93, a CaMK-II inhibitor. Thus, as one of the consequences of CaMK-II activation, vimentin phosphorylation and rearrangement may support virus replication by playing a structural role for the formation of the replication factories. Collectively, this study identified the replication centers of EV 71 in huma...|$|R
40|$|A {{child with}} the flu, diphtheria, meningitis, hand, <b>foot</b> <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>diseases,</b> measles, cough <b>and</b> {{pneumonia}} with one coughs can generate airborne contaminant. In addition to infectious agents and other emissions from the occupants, airborne contaminants in indoor can originate from indoor and outdoor. Normally, the concentration level of indoor air pollutants {{is higher than}} outdoors. In Malaysia, attention to indoor air quality started when Department of Safety and Health introduce Industrial Code of Practices (COP) in 2005; revised in 2010 with additional physical parameters, biological parameter and carbon dioxide as a ventilation performance indicator to govern the 'nonindustrial place of work'. The various researches have been performed on indoor air quality, but there are limited number investigation on IAQ and respiratory illness. Ventilation improves indoor air quality {{as long as the}} incoming air is both cleaned and dried. In the past, ventilation has been applied to building to remove excess heat in hot climates. Furthermore, in support of the health care process, air condition and mechanical ventilation (ACMV) systems are called upon to perform several vital functions that affect environmental conditions, infection and hazard control, and building life safety. Through containment, dilution, and removal of pathogens and toxins, the ACMV system is a key component of facility safety and infection control as mentioned in ASHRAE 2011. In 500 IAQ investigation over the last decade, inadequate ventilation (52 %) is the primary sources of indoor air quality problem. This paper aims to investigate the effect of indoor air pollutants on respiratory symptoms of children attending child care centers with difference ventilation strategies and building characteristic. Modified ALS-DLD- 78 has been used to gather information from parent regarding their children respiratory symptom. Measurements are performed for air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, respirable particle (PM 2. 5), bacteria and fungi while information on CCC characteristics and potential surrounding air pollutants are collected via a combination of area monitoring, inspection and interviews. From the 334 responses (182 male and 152 female), 174 (52. 1 %) children experienced prevalence of persistent cough and/or cold (28. 4 %), persistent productive cough (20. 4 %), wheezing cold (36. 9 %). About 20. 1 % respondents feel that these symptoms are related to CCCs. The average value of CO 2 inside the CCCs is 1140 ± 482 ppm (CCC without provision of fresh air) and 1005 ± 314 ppm (CCC with provision of fresh air) while a minimum ventilation requirement for children's breathing zone ranging 13 cfm to 26 cfm...|$|R
40|$|Enterovirus 71 (EV 71) is {{a highly}} {{transmissible}} pathogenic agent that causes severe central nervous system diseases in infected infants and young children. Here, we reported that EV 71 VP 1 protein could bind to vimentin intermediate filaments expressed on the host cell surface. Soluble vimentin or an antibody against vimentin could inhibit the binding of EV 71 to host cells. Ac-companied with the reduction of vimentin expression on the cell surface, the binding of EV 71 to cells was remarkably decreased. Further evidence showed that the N terminus of vimentin {{is responsible for the}} interaction between EV 71 and vimentin. These results indicated that vimentin on the host cell surface may serve as an attachment site that mediated the initial binding and sub-sequently increased the infectivity of EV 71. IMPORTANCE This study delivers important findings on the roles of vimentin filaments in relation to EV 71 infection and provides information that not only improves our understanding of EV 71 pathogenesis but also presents us with potentially new strategies for the treat-ment of diseases caused by EV 71 infections. Enterovirus 71 (EV 71) is a single-stranded RNA virus that be-longs to human enterovirus species A of the genus Enterovirus within the Picornaviridae family. EV 71 was thought {{to be one of the}} main pathogenic agents that cause <b>foot,</b> hand, <b>and</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>disease</b> (HFMD) in young children (1 – 4). In recent years, out-breaks of EV 71 -related HFMD have been reported in Southeast o...|$|R
