40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the quality of disinfection of endoscopes at Brest hospital over a period from 2007  to 2009. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of microbiological investigations of endoscopes done at Brest hospital from 2007  to 2009. The interpretation of the microbiological investigations is based on the recommendations of the Comité technique national des infections nosocomiales et infections liées aux soins (CTINILS) of 2007. RESULTS: Most of the controls realized over the period deal with gastroenterological endoscopes (63. 4  %) and bronchial endoscopes (21. 8  %). Most of the controls (66. 8  %) are conformed to the target level. Only 26. 7  % of the controls get the level of action. Globally, the rate of level of action significantly increases (p= 0. 004) from 2007 (21. 2  %) to 2009 (35. 6  %). This increase is relatively important in gastroenterology endoscopy (46. 8  % in 2009  versus 24. 1  % in 2007) whereas the rate decreases in <b>bronchial</b> <b>endoscopy</b> (14. 8  % in 2009  versus 25. 9  % in 2007). In gastroenterological endoscopy, rates vary with the type of endoscopes and the context of controls, but there is no significant difference between manual disinfection and automated disinfection. The most frequent germ found in gastroenterological and <b>bronchial</b> <b>endoscopies</b> is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: Our results show that it is very difficult to insure a perfect disinfection of endoscopes. Difficulties met are certainly related with the complexity of the endoscopes and of the techniques of disinfection. Infections of patients are very infrequent in endoscopy, which takes the question of the pertinence of the threshold used for microbiological investigations...|$|R

40|$|Background. We present our {{technique}} of omental flap transposition performed through a thoracotomy <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> stump protection, and employed over 11 years. Methods. Between February 1997 and January 2008, the transdiaphragmatic harvesting of the omentum was performed, using an original technique through a thoracotomy approach, in 45 patients. Forty-three patients (29 male, 14 female), considered {{at high risk}} <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> dehiscence, simultaneously underwent pneumonectomy and 2 patients (1 male, 1 female) were treated for an early postpneumonectomy bronchopleural fistula by the standard thoracotomy route. The omental flap was mobilized through a radial incision in the diaphragm avoiding an additional laparotomy. The only contraindication for this technique was a previous abdominal intervention. Duration of follow-up ranged between 6 and 102 months (median, 46). Results. There were no complications related to the omentoplasty. Major complications related to pneumonectomy occurred in 4 patients (9 %). Perioperative mortality rate was 2. 1 % (1 of 45). The non-life threatening complication rate was 11. 1 % (5 of 45). Postoperative hospital stay ranged between 5 and 21 days (median, 8. 3) in the 43 patients undergoing prophylactic omentoplasty and was 11 and 14 days, respectively, in the 2 patients receiving omentoplasty after bronchial dehiscence. No neoplastic recurrence on the bronchial stump or late fistula occurred during follow-up. Conclusions. This {{technique of}} omental flap transposition <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> stump coverage through a thoracotomy is an effective method for the prevention and treatment of postpneumonectomy bronchopleural fistula. The amount of omentum obtained by this technique is appropriate <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> reinforcement but not for filling the pleural cavity.

40|$|ABSTRACT After {{a primary}} {{operation}} <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> carcinoma, 17 patients underwent reopera-tion for local recurrence or intrathoracic metastasis (nine squamous cell, five alveolar cell, and three adenocarcinomas). The average interval {{between the first}} and second operation was 23 months (range: six to 48 months). Twelve patients had a pneumonectomy after an initial ipsi-lateral lobectomy. Five patients underwent contralateral wedge excision after initial lobectomy or wedge excision. Three patients died within 30 days of the reoperation. Eight of the remaining 14 patients died subsequently, the time of survival averaging 18 months (range: three to 54 months). Six patients are still alive, two having survived their reoperation for more than five years. Reoperation <b>for</b> recurrent <b>bronchial</b> carcinoma is rarely performed, but it should be con-sidered in all cases where patients survive operation for lung cancer if the primary operation was thought to be radical.

40|$|Risk factors <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> hyperresponsiveness have {{previously}} {{been established in}} the general community. In settings where occupational asthma is a risk, {{it has not been}} established whether occupational sensitization or measures of exposure are important. Bronchial responsiveness to histamine was measured in a cohort of 506 workers exposed to acid anhydrides. Skin-prick tests were performed with conjugates of phthalic, maleic and trimellitic anhydride with human serum albumin and with common inhalant allergens. Employment and smoking histories were recorded. Occupational exposure was measured using personal air samplers and estimates of past exposure made by retrospective exposure assessment. Three hundred and seventy workers (73 %) had bronchial responsiveness measured (median age 39 yrs, range 18 - 77) and 46 (12 %) of these were hyperresponsive (provocative dose causing a 20 % fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1; PD 20) < or = 8 micromol). Twelve (3 %) of these responsive workers had a skin-prick test reaction to an acid anhydride conjugate, 124 (34 %) to a common inhalant allergen, and 148 (40 %) were current smokers. Multivariate analysis showed that occupational sensitization, sensitization to a common inhalant allergen, age, and pack-years of smoking were independent risk factors <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> hyperresponsiveness. Of these only occupational sensitization was completely independent of baseline FEV 1. It is concluded that sensitization to acid anhydrides is a significant risk factor <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> hyperresponsiveness.

40|$|Reduced {{attention}} span and motor skills in children limit the practicability of bronchial provocation tests.

Baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) less than 80 % of predicted and/or BHR were seen in 59 %.

40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to study}} the yield of {{malignant}} or suspicious cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAIL), endobronchial biopsy (BX) and endobronchial brushing (BR) specimens obtained at bronchoscopy. Methodology: We prospectively followed up all patients who had undergone bronchoscopy and studied those with subsequent diagnosis of bronchial carcinoma at a tertiary referral chondri. Bronchoalveolar lavage, BX and BR were performed, sequentially whenever possible, by one pulmonologist. The parameters assessed were age, gender, macroscopic bronchoscopic findings, TNM staging, radiological findings, histological typing, and diagnostic yield from BAL, BX, and BR. Results: One hundred patients (31 females, 69 males; mean age ± SD, 61. 8 ± 12. 7 years; range 32 - 81 years) were studied between 1995 and 1997. Of these, BAL, BX and BR were performed on 100, 64 and 37 cases which yielded diagnostic specimens <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> carcinoma in 69, 78. 1, and 62. 2 % of cases, respectively (P> 0. 05). Diagnostic specimens were therefore obtained in 69, 50, and 23 % of the entire patient cohort from BAL, BX, and BR, respectively (P< 0. 001). The diagnostic yield of BAL was independent of patient age, gender, site of lesion, TNM staging, histological typing and macroscopic bronchoscopic findings. Addition of BX, BR and postbronchoscopic sputum sampling to BAL only increased the yield of diagnostic specimens <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> carcinoma by 7, 0, and 4 %, respectively. Conclusion: Bronchoalveolar lavage is a highly effective sampling method to obtain cytological evidence <b>for</b> <b>bronchial</b> carcinoma. The diagnostic yield for BAL is independent of tumour or other clinical characteristics. Further studies should be performed to confirm these important and clinically relevant findings. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMucormycosis is a rare, though {{increasingly}} prevalent, life-threatening {{fungal disease}} caused by Mucorales. The incidence has {{increased over the}} last decade and its mortality remains high at around 50 %. Mucormycosis occurs mostly in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or in the context of immunosuppression resulting from chemotherapy for hematological malignancy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or solid-organ transplantation. In this situation, lung and rhino-orbito-cerebral infections are the most frequent localizations of the disease. Prompt initiation of an effective treatment is essential to decrease mortality. However, mucormycosis and aspergillosis share close clinical and radiological features. Invasive procedures such as <b>bronchial</b> <b>endoscopy</b> and/or lung biopsy are necessary to confirm diagnosis, as no indirect tests are yet validated. Therefore, the challenge is to minimize the delay in diagnosis. When present, the reversed halo sign on CT scan is suggestive of mucormycosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction is a new promising approach to detect Mucorales DNA in serum and new molecular tools are available to detect Mucorales in tissues as well as to specify species. Recommendations from ECIL and ECMM/ESCMID have recently been published on management of mucormycosis. The recommended treatment is an amphotericin B lipid formulation in combination with surgery and modification of risk factors. High-dose (10 mg/kg) of liposomal amphotericin B is recommended in case of neurological involvement and posaconazole for maintenance therapy. Place of isavuconazole as well as posaconazole new formulations (tablets and intravenous) in first line treatment have to be defined.
