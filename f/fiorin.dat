5000|$|Born in Mirano, Veneto, Davide Favaro {{started his}} career at A.C. Milan [...] of Lombardy, where he played for five years from the 1998/99 to the 2002/2003 season. In his five years at A.C. Milan, Favaro scored 59 goals and was trained by world known coaches: in fact, {{in his first season}} Favaro was coached by Luca Gotti, in the second one by Fulvio <b>Fiorin,</b> in the third one by Davide Ballardini, in the fourth one by Mauro Tassotti, and in the last one by Franco Baresi. Unfortunately, on March 2003 he had a {{ligament}} rupture that didn't allow him to play until January 2004. [...] In 2003, A.C. Milan swapped youth players with Internazionale and Parma. That season, Favaro (€1M), Marco Donadel (€2M), and Mirko Stefani (€1M) of Milan were swapped for Roberto Massaro (€2M), Filippo Porcari (€1M) and Luca Ferretti (€1M). All deals were co-ownership deals and Favaro signed a 5-year contract. He therefore played a season at Primavera Team, where he was again trained by his former coach Davide Ballardini as well as scoring 6 goals in only 12 matches. In June 2004, Parma bought the remaining rights of Favaro and Stefani, while Donadel was bought back by Milan and received in return the remaining rights for Porcari and Ferretti. He played for the Italy National Team at 2001 UEFA European Under-16 Football Championship qualifiers (now a U17 event).|$|E
50|$|By 1809 George Sinclair was {{conducting}} experiments {{at the direction}} of the Duke and also publishing papers. In 1813 he entered into a debate with Dr. William Richardson about <b>fiorin</b> grass in the Agricultural Magazine. He was a corresponding member of the Caledonian Horticultural Society in Edinburgh and read a paper there in March 1814 entitled On the prevention of the blight in fruit trees. He had struck up a friendship with Thomas Gibbs of Ampthill in Bedfordshire, who was seedsman to the Board of Agriculture and had premises in Half Moon Street Piccadilly and a nursery in Brompton. Sinclair corresponded with him regularly and purchased seeds and plants from him. Some of his letters refer to the experiments that he {{was conducting}} at Woburn Abbey under the guidance of Sir Humphry Davy to compare the performance of different species and various mixtures of grasses and herbs on different types of soil. These experiments and their results were published in an Appendix to Davy's Elements of Agricultural Chemistry in 1815. Sinclair had also consulted James Sowerby about the analysis of soils and submitted an advance copy of his publication on grasses to the 3rd Earl of Hardwicke for his opinion. Hortus gramineus Woburnensis was published in 1816, an expensive folio volume containing dried specimens of the grasses examined. These were replaced by plates in cheaper editions published in 1825, 1826, and 1829, and in a German translation by Frederick Schmidt of 1826. The nutritional value of the grasses as animal fodder was assessed through comparison of their water-soluble constituents. Between 1818 and 1820 Sinclair carried out experiments on the use of salt as manure for the growing of wheat which he described in a prize essay.|$|E

30|$|Remember that, ontologically, we have {{to grant}} the {{existence}} of two distinct experiencers and two distinct experiences. Delfitto and <b>Fiorin</b> (2014 b) provide linguistic evidence that the de se reports of certain control verbs (such as “imagine” and “remember”) are also unambiguously immune to ‘error through misidentification’ {{on the part of}} the author of the reported attitude. As originally discussed by Higginbotham (2003), the statement “Jim remembers saying that John should finish his thesis by July” cannot be true in a scenario in which John fails to identify himself as the person having the experience of saying that John should finish his thesis by July. In fact, the sentence is judged as unsound in a context such as “Jim remembers saying that John should finish his thesis by July, although, now that he thinks about it, he is not sure it was him who he remembers saying it.” Notice, importantly, that the immunity to error is not conveyed by slightly different grammatical formats. The sentence “Jim remembers himself saying that John should finish his thesis by July” does not contradict the following continuation: “although, now that he thinks about it, he is not sure it was him who he remembers saying it.” Delfitto and <b>Fiorin</b> (2014 b) contend that a proper modeling of the semantics of these peculiar statements requires that experiencers and experiences be regarded as belonging to ontological classes distinct from individuals and events. In particular, two properties are of importance in the context of the present discussion: (i) for each experience there is one and only one experiencer (hence, any two experiences with two different experiencers are necessarily different experiences); (ii) for each experience there is one and only one point in time at which the experience occurs (hence, any two experiences occurring at two different points in time are necessarily numerically distinct experiences). While we refer the reader to Delfitto and <b>Fiorin</b> (2014 b) for a throughout discussion of the precise metaphysical status of these ontological classes and their consequences for a theory of meaning, in the reminder of this article we would like to demonstrate how the two properties mentioned above provide a principled answer to the puzzle of FID.|$|E

30|$|The second {{consideration}} {{concerns the}} presence of negation in the interrogative sentences. Delfitto and <b>Fiorin</b> (2014 b), point out that negation in surprise exclamatives is expletive, i.e. it does not contribute its canonical meaning as a propositional operator. The same can certainly be argued {{with respect to the}} surprise interrogatives discussed here. However, note that {{the presence of}} the negation is these cases goes together with the falseness of the predicate in the actual world, e.g. in the case presented in (1), the dress is in fact not red. Hence, there is a sense under which the negation indeed negates the predicate. The significance of this observation must be ascertained by means of further research.|$|E

A coleta de dados foi realizada nos meses de abril e maio de 2008, mediante uma entrevista semiestruturada gravada. Na análise do {{material}} empírico, utilizamos a abordagem de análise de discurso proposta por <b>Fiorin.</b> No que se refere aos sentidos atribuídos à velhice, verificamos que boa parte dos homens se sentem jovens, "velhos só na idade" ou diante da desvalia social da aposentadoria. Os demais consideram a velhice algo negativo para suas vidas, que ameaça sua autonomia e independência. As mulheres, em sua maioria, expressam e vivem a velhice de modo ambíguo, ou seja, apesar de entenderem a velhice como algo negativo e presente em suas vidas, essa fase do ciclo vital representa, para muitas, uma oportunidade de desfrutar os anos de vida que lhes restam de forma mais livre.

40|$|This paper {{views and}} {{discusses}} discourses on social responsibility in organizations {{and their use}} of the environmental theme. We suppose that strategies are used to disseminate some discourses concerning these matters. The ambiguities of themes within organizations point to a fragmented discourse (Fineman, 1996), revealing practices of openness and dissimulation. The theoretical discussion starts with the theme of social responsibility, confronting it with an environmental theme and discusses discourses with ambiguities of organizational practice stemming from two themes. At the end, a case study of Antena completes the discussion. Data was collected with documental research and semi-structured interviews. We made use of Discourse Analysis methodology (<b>Fiorin,</b> 1989). In conclusion, the concern with social responsibility and its environmental thematic lie within the organization. It is found in the discourse and actions at a high administration level including managers and a high number of technical workers. The silence about the limits of this responsibility is fulfilled by a technical workers group that reveals dissimulation when openness menaces some objectives...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} discourse formations acting as “memes” {{in social}} networks based on the writings of <b>Fiorin</b> (1998) and the Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) as theoretical support.  According to the conceptions of Fairclough (2001 a, 2001 b; 2003), CDA {{is a theory}} of discourse that aims to investigate language as a social and ideological practice. Thus, the study opens with considerations about the appearance of the term coined by Richard Dawkins in his book The Selfish Gene (1976), in which the author postulates the idea of “meme” – unity of cultural information that is replicated from person to person – in analogy to genes. Another theoretical perspective considered in the investigation are the conceptions of Susan Blackmore (1999) on the role of “memes” as a powerful force shaping our cultural evolution through ideas copied from individual to individual by imitation. The work closes with discussions on the implications of the role played by memetic components in virtual environments as an ideological representation of voices of characters {{from the real world}} that post comments in social networks, thus fostering discussions that cooperate to the dissemination of “memes”. </em...|$|E

40|$|As histórias da mitologia tentam expressar uma verdade que não pode ser captada de outra maneira. Os mitos são a busca dessa verdade. Monteiro Lobato, ao contar histórias, buscava a verdade levando seus personagens em viagens através dos tempos. A presente dissertação tem por objetivo contrastar, à luz da intertextualidade, o texto de Monteiro Lobato em sua obra O Minotauro com textos da mitologia grega escritos por outros autores, ressaltando a maneira como a história é narrada e o conhecimento transmitido ao leitor. Para que isso seja possível, este trabalho alicerçará seus estudos em Monteiro Lobato, A. S. Franchini, André Gide, Carmen Seganfredo, Joseph Campbell, Junito Brandão, Odile Gandon, Thomas Bulfinch e Viktor D. Salis. Para a análise da intertextualidade, tomou-se como referência os autores Barros e <b>Fiorin,</b> Bakhtin, Kristeva, Koch e Travaglia. Lobato, em seu texto, utiliza-se de uma linguagem simples para contar a história da Grécia Antiga e, ao longo da narrativa, dá definições de vocábulos e deixa claro o quanto este país foi importante para o desenvolvimento da arte, da ciência e, a influência que a língua grega tem na língua portuguesa. The stories {{related to}} the myths try to express a truth, which cannot be {{captured}} in any other way. The myths are the search for this truth.

30|$|It is {{interesting}} to observe that independent arguments can be presented {{in favor of the}} idea that person features are evaluated relative to context of thought whereas gender features are evaluated relative to the context of utterance. Basing himself on a sample of more than one hundred languages, Baker (2008) observes that subject-verb agreement is the only configuration that licenses person-agreement. Baker makes sense of this data by proposing the Structural Condition on Person Agreement (SCOPA), which basically restricts person-agreement to strictly local configurations. In order to account for SCOPA, Baker proposes that Person inherently triggers an A-bar dependency. The reason is that person features are not inherently generated on the agreeing noun but are basically induced from outside by means of a sort of operator-variable agreement (see also Kratzer 2009; Delfitto and <b>Fiorin</b> 2011, 2014 a: that is, person features are base-generated at the clause level and copied by Agree on the agreeing noun phrase by means of an operator-variable dependency (that is, an A-bar-dependency). The picture that emerges is one whereby gender features are base-generated on NPs whereas person features are base-generated in a dedicated position in the left periphery of the clause; they are transmitted to NPs by means of Agreement. Person features, syntactically, are more similar to Tense than to gender features. There is a semantic counterpart to these syntactic considerations. In some languages, first and second person features can be interpreted relatively to a reported context of utterance (Anand 2006; Anand and Nevins 2004; Delfitto and <b>Fiorin</b> 2011, 2014 a; Schlenker 1999, 2003). In such languages, the counterpart of the English sentence John said that I am a hero is ambiguous between two interpretations: (1) John said that the speaker is a hero; (2) John said that John is a hero. In the second reading, I is interpreted as the speaker in the ‘reported’ speech act. These languages show that the interpretation of person features can be manipulated by scope taking operators. The same does not hold for gender features. Cooper (1983) analyzes gender features as introducing presuppositions that he calls “indexical”, {{in the sense that they}} must always be resolved globally (cf. Yanovich (2010) for some relevant qualifications). To see how this is intended to work, compare the sentence Bill said that the Queen of France talked for two hours, where the presupposition of the complement of ‘said’ need not project to the actual world, with Bill said that she talked for two hours, where the gender presupposition of ‘she’ must project to the actual world.|$|E

Para tanto, historia-se brevemente {{a propaganda}} no Brasil, focalizando-se a marca Bombril nesse contexto e destacando a importância de seu garoto-propaganda. Da mesma forma, apresentam-se conceitos básicos da Análise do Discurso de linha francesa e princípios do Dialogismo, conforme Bakhtin (com base em Orlandi, 2001; Brait, 2005, 2008; e <b>Fiorin,</b> 2008). Além disso, o estudo faz considerações sobre características do discurso publicitário, bem como acerca da utilização da imagem na sua construção. Apresentam-se, ainda, possibilidades teóricas para análises de texto e imagem dentro das peças, uma vez que somente um trabalho integrado de ambos possibilita a plena compreensão da mensagem publicitária e evidencia o diálogo com os fatos do cotidiano proposto pelos anúncios. Sendo assim, a presente pesquisa constata que o diálogo entre fatos da sociedade e o discurso publicitário na campanha da Bombril constitui um eficaz recurso de persuasão se aliado à integração das linguagens textuais e imagéticas que se mostrou também uma eficiente ferramenta de manutenção da longevidade da campanha. This paper tries to verify in which ways the dialogic {{relations between the}} advertising discourse and notable events of the community are established in the Bombril's advertisements and if these relations {{can be considered as}} persuasive resources of this kind of discourse. For this, it will be seen a succinct part of Brazilian advertisement history, focusing on Bombril brand s history in this context and highlighting the importance of its pitchman. In the same way, it will be shown the basic concepts of the French branch of Discourse Analysis and the Dialogic principles according to Bakhtin (based on Orlandi, 2001; Brait, 2005, 2008; and <b>Fiorin,</b> 2008). Besides, the study makes notes about the main characteristics of the advertisement discourse, as well as the images use in its construction. It is still going to be shown the theoretical possibilities to both text and image analysis in the pieces, once that only the integrated work of them can make possible the complete comprehension of the advertisement message and point out the dialogue with the daily facts proposed by the advertisements. Thus, the present research establishes that the dialogue between community facts and the advertising discourse in Bombril's campaign constitutes an effective persuasive resource when linked to the integration of text and images languages which has also shown itself as a useful tool to maintaining the longevity of the campaign...|$|E
40|$|The {{author of}} this study {{presents}} a brief two-part critical review {{of the concept of}} syncretism. In the first part, it is incorporated the formulations that had been more disseminated in the Semiotics field, especially the proposals of Greimas and Courtes in the first great dictionary of theory (1979) and the proposal of J. M. Flochs in the second dictionary (1986). In the second part, a summary is presented concerning the author’s hypotheses which were developed in his master's dissertation (1983). The objective is to put side by side the two critical parts of his text to make a revision and submit it to the reflection of those interested in the subject. The author believes that even today there is not either an adequate definition of the concept of syncretism or a precise place of its occurrence in the theoretical instances when it is required the description of multi-code languages. The extension of the concept of syncretism – from its field of origin in phonological linguistic and morphological and syntactic analysis (such as "neutralization") to the vast field of complex languages - although already foreshadowed in Hjelmlev’s propositions, requires a transposition of large-scale that is not yet considered in the developments that the concept has already achieved. The author endorses some urgent tasks proposed by <b>Fiorin</b> (2009) to overcome the pointed shortage and proposes others. O autor apresenta breve revisão crítica do conceito de sincretismo em dois vetores. No primeiro, retoma as formulações que mais se difundiram no campo, a partir das propostas de A. J. Greimas e J. Courtés, no primeiro grande dicionário da teoria (1979), e de J. M. Floch no segundo (1986). No segundo, apresenta breve resumo de suas próprias hipóteses elaboradas em texto de dissertação de mestrado (1983) que permaneceu inédita. Tem a intenção de colocar lado a lado os dois vetores de sua revisão para a reflexão crítica dos interessados no tema. O autor considera que ainda hoje não se tem uma definição adequada desse conceito, nem do lugar preciso de sua ocorrência nas instâncias criadas em teoria, quando acionado para a descrição das linguagens multicódicas. A extensão do conceito de sincretismo, de seu campo de origem na linguística fonológica e morfossintática (como “neutralização”) para o vasto campo das linguagens complexas, embora já prenunciado nas proposições hjemslevianas, requer uma transposição de grande envergadura, ainda não contemplada pelos desenvolvimentos que o conceito já pôde obter.

40|$|Introduction: Religion {{has helped}} the lower classes to raise the {{perspective}} of "divine justice" {{in the struggle for}} survival by allowing their believers to seek, in their practices, under the influence of religious leaders, the main guidelines to alleviate the suffering from the health-disease process. Objective: Unveil the limits and potentialities of religious leaders' influence on the health-disease process. Materials and Methods: Exploratory-type research, with a qualitative approach, based methodologically on the Historical Dialectical Materialism. For the data analysis, one used the discourse analysis technique proposed by <b>Fiorin.</b> Results: From the empirical universe, two analytical categories emerged: (1. Limits and possibilities of religious influence in relation to the health-disease process; 2. Vulnerabilities of the Unified Health System and the complementarity of religion: Interfaces of the health-disease process in postmodernity), in which religious practices, institutions and leaders express positively health care {{in the face of the}} disease process. However, the religious leader's power relations over the community and religious fanaticism make the search for religion to have a negative influence on people's health-disease process. Conclusion: Religious leaders encourage the complementarity between religion and medicine only at times when their believers need medium and high-complexity assistance, showing little attention to the preventive aspects of self-care, which reinforces the need to invest in new studies in the area...|$|E

As a concept of culture we used a set of values and artifacts whose meanings guide the behavior of individuals and is subject to changes through cultural learning processes (Davel, Dupuis, & Chanlat, 2008; Sainsaulieu, 1977). The research methodology used was the discourse analysis based on the dimensions of figures and themes that {{are present in the}} discourses (<b>Fiorin,</b> 2008). The data were collected from books and articles published in the main Canadian journals, with emphasis on the publications of the École Nationale d´Administration Publique (ENAP, Quebec).

40|$|Language, {{with its}} plural contents, {{takes place in}} the {{expression}} of a specific speech, crossed by interdiscursivity, patented in the multiplicity of texts, as Charaudeau and Maingueneau (2011) taught. Every language, being immanent to people with different histories and cultures, has an extensive discursive diversity, reflected in the different domains or communities that take hold of it. All these various domains, however, provide patterns for their speakers to understand each other. These patterns, when grouped in sets, can be considered as grammars that describe the variants of a language, which causes a polysemy inherent to the concepts of "grammar" and "pattern". It is up to the school, in a dialectical perspective involving variants born in several factors, present to the student the standard variant, because this variant is suitable to certain situational contexts and, therefore, their knowledge allows full access to citizenship, as shown by Azeredo (2008). I try in this paper to explain this statement, as well as outline ways to generate a successful standard-grammar teaching, based on a set of practices involving prescription (evidenced by scholars as BECHARA, 1990), subjectivity (taken by linguists as BENVENISTE, 1998) and otherness (presented in the works of <b>FIORIN,</b> 2006; NEVES, 2000 and ANTUNES, 2003) ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the use of}} {{the discourse}} as a strategy for the dissemination of new cultural values in a State Secretary beginning in 1995. For this purpose, discourse analysis was used according to the concept by <b>Fiorin</b> (1997) based on the concepts of figures, themes and ways to manipulate discourses. It is a descriptive and exploratory study. The theoretical discussion was based on the concept of organizational culture in the dimensions of artifacts and cultural values. The analysis was carried out from the documents of the organization, including the projects of modernization, plans of action, reports of strategic planning, laws and decrees. Furthermore, the official journal of the organization from 1998 to 2006 was analyzed. For the years 2007 and 2009, the analysis was conducted based on the organization’s website. The results show that there was deep concern with regard to the theme of organizational culture during the whole process of modernization. They also indicate that the organization used different discourse resources to guide the individual behavior of its members such as seduction, temptation, intimidation and provocation. They also show that the official discourses are not in harmony with the various discourses found in the organization due to the plurality of values that are shared by the organizational actors...|$|E

Esses contos foram publicados no livro de estreia do autor, Malagueta, Perus e Bacanaço, em 1963, e apresentam narrativas com personagens que vivem do jogo, utilizando toda sorte de artimanhas no universo da malandragem. Baseando-se em alguns fundamentos da semiótica das paixões, inscrita dentro da chamada Escola de Paris, de linha greimasiana, a análise investiga os estados de alma que resultam das transformações que ocorrem ao longo das narrativas. Como suporte de fundamentação teórica, utiliza principalmente os conceitos desenvolvidos por A. J. Greimas e J. Fontanille, Diana Pessoa de Barros, José Luiz <b>Fiorin,</b> Elizabeth Harkot-de-la-Taille e Claude Zilberberg. O estudo se inicia com a apresentação dos fundamentos teóricos da semiótica das paixões e segue com a análise dos três contos, com o exame do modo como as instaurações dos sentimentos de orgulho e seus correlatos e de avidez e seus correlatos acompanham as transformações de estados dos sujeitos das narrativas. A análise se completa com a aplicação dos conceitos de missividade e fluxo discursivo, de Zilberberg, e com o questionamento dos confrontos entre os universos da norma social e da malandragem que permeiam os objetos de estudo. This {{dissertation}} analyzes three {{short stories}} by João Antônio Meninão do Caixote, Malagueta, Perus e Bacanaço and Visita, {{within the context}} of a snooker hall in the city of São Paulo, in Brazil. These short stories were included in the authors first publication, Malagueta, Perus e Bacanaço, in 1963, and present narratives with characters that make their living from the game, employing all the luck of the hustle within the universe of deceit, of trickery. Based on a selection of Greimas fundamentals on the semiotics of passion, ingrained in the so-called School of Paris, the analysis investigates the states of the soul stemming from the transformations that arise throughout the narratives. To sustain the theoretical foundations, it uses, mainly, the concepts developed by A. J. Greimas and J. Fontanille, Diana Pessoa de Barros, José Luiz <b>Fiorin,</b> Elizabeth Harkot-de-la-Taille and Claude Zilberberg. The study begins by presenting the theoretical fundamentals of the semiotics of passion, followed by the analysis of the three short stories. Such analysis examines the way in which the feeling of pride and its spin-offs come about, as well as the way in which those of desire and its spin-offs accompany the transformations of each subjects state within the narratives. The examination is finalized by applying Zilberbergs concepts of tensivity and the flow of discourse, and by questioning the confrontation between the universe of social conventions and that of deceit, which permeates the objects of this study...|$|E
40|$|Dentre os vários códigos simbólicos existentes na esfera cultural, o discurso literário aparece-nos como {{relevante}} para a análise da multiplicidade linguística e discursiva inerente a cultura, pois pelo seu teor plurissignificativo, se configura como dispositivo hermenêutico que permite revelar a dimensão multifacetada do real. A partir disto, este trabalho busca investigar, através dos contos “A cadeira na sombra”, “Sextafeira da paixão” e “Os mortos são estrangeiros”, os quais compõem a obra Os mortos são estrangeiros (1970), do escritor norte-rio-grandense Newton Navarro, como os mortos continuam presentes enquanto memória dos personagens vivos. Nas narrativas examinadas, detectamos elementos recorrentes que permitem entrever que, embora, a morte coloque em pauta a ausência irremediável, “antes estava, agora já não mais estar”, ela não rompe definitivamente com os vínculos que ligam os mortos e os vivos. O corpo se dissipa, mas a memória do morto continua a existir entre os vivos. Isto se dá por vários motivos próprios da complexidade e mistério do humano, dentre os quais, por razões existenciais, religiosas ou sociais. Para a realização deste trabalho utilizamos as leituras de: BAKHTIN (2003, 1992); BARROS (1999, 1995); BOSI (1994); BRANDÃO (2006, 2005, 2004); CULLER (1999); DUARTE & MACÊDO (2001); EAGLETON (2003); <b>FIORIN</b> (2006, 1999); GOMES (1995); GURGEL (2001); MAINGUENEAU (2008, 2006, 1993); NAVARRO (2003); RICOUER (2007, 1992) VALDÉS (1996); ZIEGLER (1977), entre outros. Among {{the several}} symbolic codes in existing the cultural sphere, literary speech appears us as relevant {{for the analysis}} of linguistic and discursive multiplicity inherent to the culture, because of his tenor of many meanings, if it configures itself as device for interpretation of sacred texts allowing to reveal the dimension of many facets of the real. Therefore, this work searches to investigate, through the short stories "A cadeira na sombra", "Sexta-feira da paixão" and " Os mortos são estrangeiros", which compose the work Os mortos são estrangeiros (1970), from the north-rio-grandense writer Newton Navarro, as the deads remain present while in the alives characters' memory. Within the narratives examined, we detected appealing elements that allow us to prove that, although the death puts on the agenda the hopeless absence, "before you were, now no longer you are", it doesn't breaks up definitively with the bonds that tie the deads to the alives. The body vanishes, but the memory of the dead continues to exist among the living world. This feels either for religious faiths or for other elements of the social life due to affectionate reasons involving this issue. For the accomplish of these work, utilize the reading of: BAKHTIN (2003, 1992); BARROS (1999, 1995); BOSI (1994); BRANDÃO (2006, 2005, 2004); CULLER (1999); DUARTE & MACÊDO (2001); EAGLETON (2003); <b>FIORIN</b> (2006, 1999); GOMES (1995); GURGEL (2001); MAINGUENEAU (2008, 2006, 1993); NAVARRO (2003); RICOUER (2007, 1992) VALDÉS (1996); ZIEGLER (1977), among other...|$|E

Based on this finding, we try to give an overview on this subject in our region and understand the facts that trigger these phenomena, together to determine the variants present in each case, and to review the theoretical concepts related to diphthong and monophthong. So, answer the following questions: What is the role of education variable in the deletion of dental / d / in the gerund? As such deletion can be justified? The variable gender/sex is {{a major factor in the}} formation of phenomena diphthongization and monophthongization in this region? We maintain our research on the assumptions Labovian sociolinguistic scholars of variational nature as Faraco and Tezza (1992) and <b>Fiorin</b> (2011) and grammar, Dubois (2000) and Cunha and Cintra (2013). When analyzing the data statistically, we observed that monophthongization was the most recurrent phenomenon in the speech samples that we had, with a percentage of 47 % for high school and 39 % for primary education II; the diphthongization presented a secondary index, with 23 % for high school and 32 % for primary education II.

40|$|A proposta desta tese é analisar, na trajetória do poeta Ferreira Gullar, a presença constante e cada vez mais frequente de metapoemas que sistematizam uma noção de poesia na qual se destaca, entre os diferentes ethé presentes, um ethos professoral, com discurso marcadamente filosófico: o enunciador argumenta, explica, critica e ensina. A teoria utilizada para a análise do corpus, composto de doze poemas, pautou-se na estilística-discursiva, mais especificamente, a relação entre os recursos linguísticos utilizados (sonoros, lexicais, sintáticos, semânticos) e os efeitos de sentido produzidos no plano da enunciação e do discurso. Para os estudos estilísticos (a noção de estilo) e da enunciação, foram consideradas as teorias de Charles Bally (1951), Mattoso Câmara (1961, 1973, 1977), Mikhail Bakhtin (2002, 2003, 2013), Sírio Possenti (2000, 2001), Nilce Sant´Anna Martins (1989) e Émile Benveniste (2006). Para a Análise do Discurso de linha francesa, são discutidos os conceitos de Dominique Maingueneau (1993, 2008, 2011), especialmente sobre ethos discursivo e cenografia. Finalmente, para as considerações sobre a metalinguagem/ metadiscurso e argumentação, presentes nos poemas metalinguísticos, são citados os estudos de Roman Jakobson (1990, 2004, 2007), Samira Chalhub (2002), Sírio Possenti (2000, 2001), Ruth Amossy (2005, 2007, 2011), José Luiz <b>Fiorin</b> (2004, 2015) e Ingedore Koch (2003, 2004, 2007). A partir da análise do corpus, torna-se possível concluir que, na medida em que o militante marxista morre na poesia gullariana, ganham mais voz o crítico de arte e o filósofo Ferreira Gullar. Nesse sentido, o ethos professoral se faz presente e permite refletir sobre o tom didático dos poemas, na forma como ensinam sobre o gênero e o fazer poético. Partiu dos próprios poemas analisados a motivação para a atividade didática proposta no capítulo final. The {{proposal}} of this thesis is to analyze, in {{the trajectory of}} the poet Ferreira Gullar, the constant and progressively frequent presence of metapoems which systematize a notion of poetry within which could be highlited, among the several present ethé, a professoral ethos, with a remarkable philosophic discourse: the enunciator arguments, explains, criticizes and teaches. The theory used {{in the analysis of}} the corpus, comprised of twelve poems, include discoursive stylistics, more especifically, the relationship between the linguistic resources used (sound, lexical, synthatic and semantic) and the effects of meaning produced in the plan of enunciation and discourse. Regarding the studies of stylistics (the notion of style) and enunciation, the theory of such authors like Charles Bally (1951), Mattoso Câmara (1961, 1973, 1977), Mikhail Bakhtin (2002, 2003, 2013), Sírio Possenti (2000, 2001), Nilce Sant´Anna Martins (1989) and Émile Benveniste (2006) were considered. On the the French Discourse Analysis side, the concepts of Dominique Maingueneau (1993, 2008, 2011), especially the ones of ethos and scenography, were brought into our discussion. Finally, in our considerations on metalanguage/ metadiscourse, the studies of Roman Jakobson (1990, 2004, 2007), Samira Chalhub (2002), Sírio Possenti (2000, 2001), Ruth Amossy (2005, 2007, 2011), José Luiz <b>Fiorin</b> (2004, 2015) and Ingedore Koch (2003, 2004, 2007) were called. After the analysis of the corpus, it was possible to conclude that, as the voice of the marxist militant fades in the gullarian poetry, the voices of both the art critic and the philosopher Ferreira Gullar rise. In this sense, the professoral ethos is present and makes it possible to reflect about the didactic tone of the poems, in the way they teach the genre and the poetic craft. The motivation for the didactic activity proposed in the final chapter of this thesis had its origin {{in the study of the}} poems heretofore analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Essa dissertação faz uma análise dos textos opinativos publicados sobre os transgênicos ou organismos geneticamente modificados nos jornais Estado de Minas, Folha de S. Paulo, O Globo e Zero Hora entre 2003 e 2004. A intenção é identificar quais os principais valores sociais ou culturais que se articulam nas diferentes percepções de risco sobre os ogms que circulam nesse espaço público de veiculação de idéias. Buscou-se também identificar os principais atores sociais que se manifestam nos discursos, as temáticas e assuntos mais recorrentes e a relação estabelecida no discurso com a ciência (confiança ou desconfiança). Como aporte teórico metodológico, a análise partiu da premissa de que a tecnologia é sempre produto de tensões sociais e que conflitos dessa natureza devem ser compreendidos não apenas como disputas técnicas, mas sobretudo políticas. Assim, algumas idéias desenvolvidas por Habermas, Marcuse, Beck, Douglas e Wildavisky, Guivant e Figueiredo e outros autores da sociologia servem de orientação para o olhar dado na análise. A teoria da análise do discurso como proposta por <b>Fiorin,</b> Brandão e Maingueneau foi utilizada como ferramenta metodológica para a operacionalização da análise. Dentre outros achados, constatou-se que dentre os 291 textos analisados, entre cartas, editoriais e artigos, a maior parte apresenta assuntos e argumentos centrados em aspectos econômicos. Questões religiosas e ambientais foram bem menos citadas durante a argumentação. A importância dada à rotulagem também foi mínima, com poucos atores tratando do assunto. O Rio Grande do Sul foi o estado de onde vieram mais textos (41 %). Em relação às tendências apresentadas referentes à utilização da tecnologia, 43 % dos textos foram classificados como totalmente favoráveis, 19 % totalmente desfavoráveis e 34 % apresentaram uma ponderação de argumentos pró e contra os ogms. This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} analysis of the opinion s texts published about the genetic modified organisms in the newspapers Estado de Minas, Folha de S. Paulo, O Globo and Zero Hora, between 2003 and 2004. The aim was to identify which social or cultural values had been used {{in the construction of the}} different risk perceptions that circulated in these public spheres of debate. The objective was also to identify which social actors took part in the debate, the main themes and issues raised, and the relation established between the discourse and the science (if trustworthy or not). Methodologically and theoretically, this research was conducted considering that new technologies are always product of social tensions and can not be considered only as a technical dispute, but mainly a political issue. The ideas developed by Habermas, Marcuse, Beck, Douglas and Wildavisky, Guivant and Figueiredo, among others sociological authors are used as framework for the analysis. The Discourse Analysis theory, as proposed by <b>Fiorin,</b> Brandão and Maingueneau was used as a methodological tool to the texts analysis. In 291 texts read for this research, among letters, editorials and articles, the majority presents economical arguments. The religious and environmental reasons and arguments were not very much present among the texts. The labeling of the gm product was not considered important, as the majority of for the authors did not mentioned it. The Rio Grande do Sul estate was the one from which came majority the texts analyzed: (41 %). In relation to the tendencies presented, 43 % of the texts agreed with the use and development of gm products, 19 % of the texts totally disagree with it, and 34 % presents arguments of agreement and disagreement...|$|E

As conclus?es das an?lises mostram que os esquemas de apreens?o do discurso de outrem instauram a autoria a partir dos seguintes aspectos: (1) o autor administra as vozes consonantes e dissonantes que atravessam sua enuncia??o; (2) o autor cria fronteiras, estabelecendo altern?ncia entre o discurso citante e o discurso citado; (3) o autor infiltra sua entona??o expressivo-valorativa no discurso do outro; (4) o autor posiciona o discurso do outro como par?metro/base para avaliar determinado evento.

To do this, we follow enunciative postulates, more precisely, from The Bakhtin Circle and dialoguing with studies under Dialogic Theory/Analysis of Speech, among them, Faraco (2005); Amorim (2006); Brait (2006); Francelino (2007; 2011); Cunha (2008); <b>Fiorin</b> (2008); Grillo (2010); Sobral (2012; 2013); Aran (2014), and also Discourse Analysis studies, more precisely, Orlandi (2000; 2001); Tfouni (2006); Possenti (2001; 2009; 2013). Methodologically, this research is characterized as documentary and bibliographic with a descriptive and interpretative character. The corpus consists of five monographs produced by Lettras students. Specifically, the research aims to: (i) identify and describe linguistic, discursive and enunciative schemes of another's speech transmission employed in the monographic genre; (ii) to discuss issues arising from speech schemes that shape the authorship in {{the construction of}} meanings on the monographic genre. According to our analysis, another's speech incorporation schemes establish the authorship from the following aspects: (1) the author manages consonant and dissonant voices that are involved in their enunciation; (2) the author creates borders establishing an alternation between the reported speech and the speech that is reporting; (3) the author infiltrates his/her expressive-evaluative tone in another?s speech; (4) the author places the discourse of the other as a parameter/basis for evaluate a particular event. The schemes to seize and transmission anothers's speech are ways in which language indicates the impressions of another's speech and marks the subjectivity of the speaker. Thus, monograph genre is like a stage in which, voices, style, compositional structure and objectal-semantic content is built from the meeting between speeches.
