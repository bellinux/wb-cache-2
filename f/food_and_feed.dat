25|$|There are strong, direct {{relationships}} between agricultural productivity, hunger, poverty, and sustainability. Three-quarters of the world's poor live {{in rural areas}} and make their living from agriculture. Hunger and child malnutrition are greater in these areas than in urban areas. Moreover, the higher {{the proportion of the}} rural population that obtains its income solely from subsistence farming (without the benefit of pro-poor technologies and access to markets), the higher the incidence of malnutrition. Therefore, improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale farmers will benefit the rural poor first. <b>Food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feed</b> crop demand is likely to double in the next 50 years, as the global population approaches nine billion. Growing sufficient food will require people to make changes such as increasing productivity in areas dependent on rainfed agriculture; improving soil fertility management; expanding cropped areas; investing in irrigation; conducting agricultural trade between countries; and reducing gross food demand by influencing diets and reducing post-harvest losses.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT To get {{success in}} culture of any fish species, detail {{knowledge}} on <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> habit {{of that particular}} fish species is really essential.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the experiences of}} public health nurses (PHNs) in counsel- ing immigrant parents on <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> practices at child health centers (CHCs). Design and Sample: In this study employing a qualitative description (QD) approach, the participants (n = 26) were PHNs from five CHCs in the greater Oslo region of Norway. Measures: Data were collected through five focus group interviews and examined using qualitative content analysis. Results: Counseling on <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> practices was an important topic in most consultations with immigrant parents. The PHNs were concerned that the child should eat ordinary, healthy food regu- larly. Immigrant families were often experienced as a generic group and the PHNs disclosed that they rarely adjusted their counseling strategy based on enquiries about families food culture or parents level of education or knowledge. Time constraints and language and cultural barriers were common challenges. The PHNs suggested that culturally adapted information materials and visual aids from health authorities could improve communication. Conclusions: Counseling immigrant parents on <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> at CHCs is often challenging for PHNs. The study findings {{could be used in}} the develop- ment of guidelines to assist PHNs in delivering culturally competent counseling about <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> practices...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> habits of fishes forms an {{important}} aspect of fishery biological investigations. Some work has been done in the past on the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> habits of oil sardine, Sardinella longiceps Val. Hornell (1910) first published an account of the food of oil sardine and also emphasised the importance of undertaking the study in greater detail. Hornell and Nayudu (1924) gave a brief account on the food of oil sardine along with a note on the plankton off West-Hill, Calicut. Subsequent studies on the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> habits of this fish have been made by Chidambaram (1950) and Nair (1953) and brief references by John and Menon (1942), Nair and Subrahmanyan (1955) and Subrahmanyan (1959). Thus, some amount of reliable information is already available on the <b>food</b> <b>and</b> <b>feeding</b> habits of the oil sardine. The results published so far do not, however, include any observations north of Calicut, which is a fishing centre on the Malabar coast- The present account deals with some preliminary quantitative and qualitative observations made on the food of Sardinella longiceps Val., at Mangalore, an important fishing centre representative of the Mysore coast during the period February 1957 to January 1960...|$|R
