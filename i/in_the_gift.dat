5|$|The {{original}} {{building on}} the present site was constructed in the late 13th or early 14th century, at {{around the same time}} as the friary, which was founded in about 1296. Its hilltop location is unusual for the area; most nearby churches are built on mounds near water. The new church was dedicated to Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of sailors, and the living was first recorded as being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> of Sir John de Cockfield, passing to his Bacon descendants before its acquisition by the Abbot and Convent of Langley in 1375. The abbey controlled more than 60 Norfolk parishes, and the living of Blakeney was within its gift for the next sixty years, ending with the dissolution of the abbey in 1435. The patronage seems then to have passed to the Earl of Sussex, but quickly transferred to John Calthorpe, a descendant of the original founder, John Cockfield, and it remained with his family until 1922. Sir Alfred Jodrell then acquired the patronage, bequeathing it to Keble College, Oxford on his death in 1956. Since 1989, the benefice has been <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> of Keble College, and the Bishop of Norwich.|$|E

He still held Lochrutton on 18 April 1390, when the letter was repeated. Thomas remained provost of Maybole until at least 1401, and perhaps until his consecration as Bishop of Galloway in 1415. No-one else is known to have held the position of provost there until 1439, although this proves nothing as the evidence for such things in the south-west of Scotland in this period is always scarce.|$|E

An observation deck providing views of the incline, the city, and the valley is located {{on the opposite side of}} the station from the visitor center. Two hiking trails allow visitors to walk the slope. One is a sculpture trail, with works created in 1989 by local artist James Wolfe, who used remnants of the Bethlehem Steel factory in Johnstown.|$|E

25|$|When the {{exchange}} is immediate, as in barter, {{it does not}} create a social relationship. When {{the exchange}} is delayed, it creates both a relationship {{as well as an}} obligation for a return (i.e. debt). Hence, some forms of reciprocity can establish hierarchy if the debt is not repaid. The failure to make a return may end a relationship between equals. Reciprocal exchanges can also have a political effect through the creation of multiple obligations and the establishment of leadership, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>gift</b> exchanges (Moka) between Big Men in Melanesia. Some forms of reciprocity are thus closely related to redistribution, where goods and services are collected by a central figure for eventual distribution to followers.|$|E
