5|$|Halo Wars is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 console, in which players command armies from a bird's-eye view of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements. It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the A button is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a <b>double</b> <b>tap</b> selects all units of the same type. The d-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right analog stick adjusts the camera angle. A radial menu is used for base construction.|$|E
25|$|Mătăsăreanu's {{vehicle was}} {{rendered}} inoperable after {{two of its}} tires were shot out and the windshield covered in bullet holes. At 9:56 am, he attempted to carjack a yellow 1963 Jeep Gladiator on Archwood by shooting at the driver who fled on foot, three blocks east of where Phillips died. He quickly transferred all of his weapons and ammunition from the getaway car, {{but was unable to}} operate the Jeep due to him being unfamiliar with the stick-shift vehicle. As KCBS and KCAL helicopters hovered overhead, a patrol car driven by SWAT officers quickly arrived and stopped {{on the opposite side of}} the truck to where the Chevrolet was stopped. Mătăsăreanu left the truck, took cover behind the original getaway car, and engaged them for two-and-a-half minutes of almost uninterrupted gunfire. Mătăsăreanu's chest armor deflected a <b>double</b> <b>tap</b> from one of the SWAT officers, which briefly winded him before he continued firing. At least one SWAT officer fired his AR-15 below the cars and wounded Mătăsăreanu in his unprotected lower legs; he was soon unable to continue and put his hands up to show surrender.|$|E

50|$|A <b>double</b> <b>tap</b> is a {{shooting}} technique where two shots are fired {{in rapid succession}} at the same target with the same sight picture (different from the controlled pair, where a second sight picture is acquired for the second shot).

The term hammer is sometimes used to describe a <b>double</b> <b>tap</b> in which the firearm's sights are not reacquired by the shooter between shots.|$|E

Magnet blocks repel other magnet blocks of the same color, but can be dragged {{next to each other}} by the player. Magnet blocks are only affected by what is immediately above, below, to the right, or to the left of them so that they will only repel along columns or rows of tiles in the game. This also means that they can be formed into non-linear shapes with ease. They automatically connect to an adjacent magnet block of a different color and must be manually separated by <b>double</b> <b>tapping</b> one of the blocks.|$|R
