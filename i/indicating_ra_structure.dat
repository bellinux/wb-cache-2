40|$|Although Ras residue phenylalanine- 156 (F 156) is {{strictly}} conserved in {{all members of}} the Ras superfamily of proteins, it is located outside of the consensus GDP/GTP-binding pocket. Its location within the hydrophobic core of Ras suggests that its strict conservation reflects a crucial role in structural stability. However, mutation of the equivalent residue (F 157 L) in the Drosophila Ras-related protein Rap results in a gain-of-function phenotype, suggesting an alternative role for this residue. Therefore, we have introduced an F 156 L mutation into Ras to evaluate the role of this residue in <b>Ras</b> <b>structure</b> and function. Whereas introduction of this mutation activated the transforming potential of wild-type Ras, it did not impair that of oncogenic Ras. Further, Ras (156 L) exhibited an extremely rapid off rate for bound GDP/GTP in vitro and showed increased levels of Ras. GTP in vivo. To determine the structural basis for these altered properties, we used high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The F 156 L mutation caused loss of contact with residues 6, 23, 55, and 79, resulting in disruption of secondary structure in alpha-helix 1 and in beta-sheets 1 - 5. These major structural changes contrast with the isolated alterations induced by oncogenic mutation (residues 12 or 61) that perturb GTPase activity, and instead, weaken Ras contacts with Mg 2 + and its guanine nucleotide substrate and result in increased rates of GDP/GTP dissociation. Altogether, these observations demonstrate the essential role of this conserved residue in <b>Ras</b> <b>structure</b> and its function as a regulated GDP/GTP switch...|$|R

40|$|Background: Few {{studies have}} focused on right atrial (<b>RA)</b> <b>structure</b> and {{function}} in pulmonary hypertension (PH). We sought to evaluate RA volume and phasic function using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and to examine their clinical relevance in PH. Methods: We prospectively studied 50 PH patients and 21 control subjects. RA volume and indices of phasic function (reservoir volume, ejection fraction [EF], and conduit volume) were evaluated by CMR. Results: Maximum RA volume index was significantly higher in PH patients (56 [44 - 70] ml/m(2)) than in controls (40 [30 - 48] ml/m(2)) (p< 0. 001). Reservoir volume index was significantly lower in PH than in controls (p< 0. 001), but conduit volume index was higher in PH than in controls (p= 0. 008). RA EF was similar when comparing the two groups (p= 0. 925). Interestingly, RA EF was increased in PH patients with WHO functional class III patients as compared with controls (p< 0. 001) but was reduced in advanced PH patients with WHO functional class IV (p< 0. 01). Maximum RA volume and RA EF significantly correlated with pulmonary hemodynamic indices, atrial and brain natriuretic hormone levels, and CMR-derived right ventricular indices. By contrast, RA reservoir volume correlated with cardiac index and 6 -minute walk distance. Conclusions: PH is associated with increased size, decreased reservoir function, and increased conduit function of the right atrium. <b>RA</b> systolic function <b>indicated</b> by <b>RA</b> EF increases in patients with mild to moderate PH but decreases in patients with advanced PH.

The goal is to combine network and channel coding to match network on graph to code on graph, and this is called adaptive network coded cooperation (ANCC).

The subtle changes in the dynamics and conformations of Ras upon effector binding require an analysis that targets local changes independent of global motions. Using a structural alphabet, a computational procedure is proposed to quantify local conformational changes. Positions detected by this approach were characterized as either specific for a particular effector, specific for an effector domain type, or as effector unspecific. A set of nine structurally connected residues (Ras residues 5 − 8, 32 − 35, 39 − 42, 55 − 59, 73 − 78, and 161 − 165), which link the effector binding site to the distant C-terminus, changed dynamics upon effector binding, indicating a potential effector-unspecific signaling route within the <b>Ras</b> <b>structure...</b>|$|R

Infection of erythroid cells with the Friend spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) leads to {{the interaction of the}} viral envelope glycoprotein with the Epo receptor and renders these cells Epo independent. We previously reported that SFFV induces Epo independence by constitutively activating components of several Epo signal transduction pathways, including the Jak-Stat and the Raf- 1 /mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. To further evaluate the mechanism by which SFFV activates the Raf- 1 /MAPK pathway, we investigated the effects of SFFV on upstream components of this pathway, and our results indicate that SFFV activates Shc and Grb 2 and that this leads to Ras activation. While studies with a dominant-negative <b>Ras</b> <b>indicated</b> that <b>Ras</b> was required for Epo-induced proliferation of normal erythroid cells, the Epo-independent growth of SFFV-infected cells can still occur in the absence of Ras, although at reduced levels.

Recent reports <b>indicated</b> that <b>Ras</b> undergoes dimerization at the membrane surface through protein-protein interactions.

One proposed mechanism of dimerization involves formation of salt bridges between the two GTPase domains (G domains) leading to formation of a compact dimer as observed in <b>Ras</b> crystal <b>structures.</b> In this work, we interrogated the intrinsic ability of Ras to self-associate in solution by creating conditions of high local concentration through irreversibly tethering the two G domains together at their unstructured C-terminal tails. We evaluated possible self-association in this inverted tandem conjugate via analysis of the time-domain fluorescence anisotropy and NMR chemical shift perturbations. We did not observe the increased rotational correlation time expected for the G domain dimer. Variation of the ionic strength (to modulate stability of the salt bridges) did not affect the rotational correlation time in the tandem further supporting independent rotational diffusion of two G domains. In a parallel line of experiments to detect and map weak self-association of the G domains, we analyzed NMR chemical shifts perturbations at a number of sites near the crystallographic dimer interface. The nearly complete lack of chemical shift perturbations in the tandem construct supported a simple model with the independent G domains repelled from each other by their overall negative charge.

40|$|Substantial {{evidence}} supports {{a critical role}} for the activation of the Raf- 1 /MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in oncogenic Ras-mediated transformation. For example, dominant negative mutants of Raf- 1, MEK, and mitogen-activated protein kinase all inhibit Ras transformation. Furthermore, the observation that plasma membrane-localized Raf- 1 exhibits the same transforming potency as oncogenic Ras suggests that Raf- 1 activation alone is sufficient to mediate full Ras transforming activity. However, the recent identification of other candidate Ras effectors (e. g., RalGDS and phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase) suggests that activation of other downstream effector-mediated signaling pathways may also mediate Ras transforming activity. In support of this, two H-Ras effector domain mutants, H-Ras(12 V, 37 G) and H-Ras(12 V, 40 C), which are defective for Raf binding and activation, induced potent tumorigenic transformation of some strains of NIH 3 T 3 fibroblasts. These Raf-binding defective mutants of H-Ras induced a transformed morphology that was indistinguishable from that induced by activated members of Rho family proteins. Furthermore, the transforming activities of both of these mutants were synergistically enhanced by activated Raf- 1 and inhibited by the dominant negative RhoA(19 N) mutant, <b>indicating</b> that <b>Ras</b> may cause transformation that occurs via coordinate activation of Raf-dependent and -independent pathways that involves Rho family proteins.

Genetic evidence <b>indicates</b> that <b>Ras</b> antiapoptotic {{activity in}} the developing eye is regulated by the Drosophila EGF receptor and operates through the Raf/MAPK pathway. Decreased activity of this pathway enhances, and increased activity suppresses, apoptosis induced by ectopic expression of the cell death regulators reaper (rpr) and head involution defective (hid). In addition, ectopic activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway in the developing embryo and in the developing eye suppresses naturally occurring apoptosis and regulates the transcription of the proapoptotic gene hid. Null alleles of hid recapitulate the antiapoptotic activities of Ras/MAPK, providing genetic evidence that downregulation of hid is an important mechanism by which Ras promotes survival...|$|R
