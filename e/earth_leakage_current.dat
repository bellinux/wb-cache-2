On {{the sections of}} line shared with main line trains, such as the District line from East Putney to Wimbledon and Gunnersbury to Richmond, and the Bakerloo line north of Queen's Park, the centre rail is bonded to the running rails as electrical return from National Rail trains is via the wheels. This was first used in the early 20th century, the isolated traction current return allowing a train's position to be detected using DC track circuits, and reduced any <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> that could affect service pipes and telephone cables.|$|R

2500|$|The {{previous}} 16th Edition of the IEE Electrical Wiring Regulations required use of RCDs for {{socket outlets}} that were {{liable to be}} used by outdoor appliances. Normal practice in domestic installations [...] was to use a single RCD to cover all the circuits requiring RCD protection (typically sockets and showers) but to have some circuits (typically lighting) not RCD protected. This was to avoid a potentially dangerous loss of lighting should the RCD trip. Protection arrangements for other circuits varied. To implement this arrangement it was common to install a consumer unit incorporating an RCD in what is known as a split load configuration, where one group of circuit breakers is supplied direct from the main switch (or time delay RCD {{in the case of a}} TT earth) and a second group of circuits is supplied via the RCD. This arrangement had the recognised problems that cumulative <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> from the normal operation of many items of equipment could cause spurious tripping of the RCD, and that tripping of the RCD would disconnect power from all the protected circuits.|$|R

40|$|A {{thermometry}} {{system for}} use during ultrasound hyperthermia treatments {{was developed to}} provide fast and reliable temperature measurements such that transient temperatures from multi-sensor thermocouples could be measured.

The system hardware development involved fabrication of a high precision temperature measurement box which was electrically isolated from, by an opto-isolation unit, and interfaced with, an 386 - 20 MHz personal computer. The system software development involved a two point calibration program for each thermocouple probe to be used with the system, and a sensor locating program to rapidly identify the probe locations immediately prior to treatment. A single scan temperature reading speed of 0. 2 sec for all 112 thermocouple sensors with an average accuracy of ± 0. 05 °C under normal operating conditions (ambient temperature 22 °C to 28 °C) was achieved.

2500|$|A {{residual-current device}} (RCD), or {{residual-current circuit breaker}} (RCCB), is a device that {{instantly}} breaks an electric circuit to prevent serious harm from an ongoing electric shock. Injury may still occur in some cases, for example if a human falls after receiving a shock. In the United States and Canada, the device is more commonly known as a {{ground fault circuit interrupter}} (GFCI), ground fault interrupter (GFI) or an appliance <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> interrupter (ALCI). In the United Kingdom, these are better known by their initials RCD, and a combined RCD+MCB (miniature circuit breaker) is known as a RCBO (residual-current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection). In Australia, they are sometimes known as safety switches or an RCD.

40|$|In modern {{developing}} world, ICT (Information and Communication Technology) usage {{is rapidly}} increasing and all commercial buildings comprise with very sensitive telecommunication equipments {{in order to}} facilitate day to day requirements. All such equipments are interconnected with network cable wiring system unless few remote operating equipments exist. On the other hand, building electrical wiring system is also laid throughout the building. In this context, it may have opportunity to interfere unwanted electrical noise to the data and voice systems hence malfunction or giving flaw data outputs. Electrical noise cause for an abnormal humming sound of the voice signals and thereby degrade the quality of sound systems. Such interference can happen due to both radiated and conductive electrical noise. One of major reasons for the conducted noise is, operation of switched mode power supplies hence lead to create of earth loops that should eliminate at the design and installation stages. Analysis of electrical noise in the system and design filtering systems need to be practiced, when noise issues are raised after the commissioning of electrical installations. It is required to do analyzing of electrical noise in the building in order to come across comprehensive conclusion for root cause for the disturbances. In doing so, harmonic levels, noise in the live wires, noise through the earth wire and earth loop possibilities are investigated. The most important part is to identify major frequency components filter those from the system. Different type of filter arrangements can be used to evaluate its performances against the noise level of the site. Similarly, installation guide lines can be followed prior to the site erection and that is the very effective method to avoid unnecessary noise induced in sensitive equipments. Though general filter arrangements eliminate noise, some frequency ranges need to be filtered separately, according to the site conditions. Since calculated L and C values can’t be exactly found out, next closet practical values were chosen thereby cutoff frequency is slightly shifted. Simulation results, for common mode noise filtering indicate, 106 Hz to 107 Hz minimal variation of cutoff frequency and 0. 03 variation in damping factor. <b>Earth</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>currents</b> drastically reduced with increasing of the earth line choke and that is possible way to control common mode noise. Introducing separate earth cables instead of single copper tape in the vertical busbar trunking system, is the elimination method of the earth loops between floors at far apart in the high rise building. Besides, it is required to use same earth termination point for the camera and the display system of the CCTV system in high rise buildings...|$|R

In place of solid earthing of star neutral point a suitable neutral grounding resistance (NGR) is added in between, restricting the <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> up to 750 mA.

50|$|As per rule 100, {{protective}} {{equipment is}} {{to be placed in}} the mines for automatic disconnection of supply when there is earth fault exceeding 750 milliampere in 250 V to 1000 Volt installations. For open cast mine the limit is 50 ampere in installations of voltage exceeding 1100 V and up to 11 kV. The <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> {{is to be}} restricted by placing suitable neutral grounding resistance (NGR) in all the distribution transformers.|$|E
50|$|Traction current {{lines are}} {{operated}} symmetrically against earth. In {{the case of}} 110 kV lines, for example, each conductor has a voltage of 55 kV against earth.

A traction powerline for one circuit has usually two conductors. Since most traction current lines possess two electric circuits, four conductors are on the pylons as a rule (in contrast with three-phase alternating current lines, whose number of conductors are an integral multiple of three).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} diagnosis of railway arrester considering uncertainty. Arresters, a protective device that prevents damage due to transient voltages, deteriorate due to the absorption of moisture, repetitive operation during over-voltages and manufacturing defects. Various diagnostic techniques are available for monitoring deterioration of arresters. The technique based on the amplitude of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> measures the root mean square or peak values of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components. After measuring the total <b>leakage</b> <b>current,</b> harmonics of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components are analyzed by using a microprocessor based device. The level of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> {{is indicative of the}} arrester conditions. Harmonics of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components occur due to nonlinear characteristics of railway arrester. Since <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> contains uncertainty characteristics of power source, the probability density functions of <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> components can be obtained for ZnO arrester. This paper {{presents a}} probabilistic approximation method for the harmonic currents analysis in diagnosis for railway arresters.

40|$|The {{search for}} higher {{magnetic}} fields in particle accelerators increasingly demands {{the use of}} superconducting magnets. This magnet technology has {{a large amount of}} magnetic energy storage during operation at relatively high currents. As such, many monitoring and protection systems are required to safely operate the magnet, including the monitoring of any leakage of current to earth in the superconducting magnet that indicates a failure of the insulation to earth. At low amplitude, the <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> affects the magnetic field precision.

The device, designed and manufactured with full compliance of the high risk environment requirements, is able to monitor online the <b>earth</b> <b>leakage</b> <b>current</b> and detect ground wire faults. Operation utilizes a microammeter with an overall sensitivity of 2. 5 x 10 (4) V/A. In order to assure the reliability of the device in providing alarm signals, the simultaneous presence of absorbed power current is monitored by means of another ammeter with decreased sensitivity (3. 0 V/A). The measured root mean square current values are compared with reference values in order to send signals to NAND and OR complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor gates to enable audible and visible alarms according to the possible hazardous cases examined in the article. The final LCS packaging was shaped as a wall socket adapter for common electromedical device power cord plugs, with particular attention to minimizing its dimensions and to provide analog voltage outputs for both measured leakage and power currents, in order to allow automatic data acquisition and computerized hazardous situation management. Finally, a personal computer based automatic measuring system has been configured to simultaneously monitor several LCSs installed in the same intensive care unit room and, as a consequence, to distinguish different hazardous scenarios and provide an adequate alert to the clinical personnel whose final decision is still required.
