The Canadian-sourced output was gradually replaced by in-house Channel M Productions as the station invested and developed more local programming, particularly following the station's launch on digital satellite services in April 2006. Major cutbacks saw most of the station's non-news output axed in May 2009. Remaining GMG production ceased on 19 March 2010, leaving the station with a schedule of archive and acquired output.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOne {{important}} issue of speech recognition systems is Out-of Vocabulary words (OOV). These words, often proper nouns or new words, {{are essential for}} documents to be transcribed correctly. Thus, they must be integrated in the language model (LM) and the lexicon of the speech recognition system. This article proposes new approaches to OOV proper noun estimation using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNNLM). The proposed approaches {{are based on the}} notion of closest in-vocabulary (IV) words (list of brothers) to a given OOV proper noun. The probabilities of these words are used to estimate the probabilities of OOV proper nouns thanks to RNNLM. Three methods for retrieving the relevant list of brothers are studied. The main advantages of the proposed approaches are that the RNNLM is not retrained and the architecture of the RNNLM is kept intact. Experiments on real text data from the website of the <b>Euronews</b> <b>channel</b> show perplexity reductions of about 14 % relative compared to baseline RNNLM...|$|E

2500|$|On 23 February 2014, a Ukrainian {{flag was}} {{drawn on the}} Soviet Army {{monument}} {{in the capital of}} Bulgaria, with one of the soldier statues also painted in yellow and blue colours. A number of pro-Euromaidan messages such as [...] "Слава Україні" [...] ("Glory to Ukraine!") were also scribbled on it. A small anti-Oresharski protester group accompanied by journalist Ivo Indzhev subsequently arrived on the scene. This occurrence drew a sharp reaction from the Russian Foreign Ministry, which demanded that the culprits be identified and punished. Also, the <b>Euronews</b> TV <b>channel's</b> decision to show a photo of the painted monument on its Facebook page was criticized by the Russian ministry as [...] "excessive". Shortly thereafter Euronews removed the image, clarifying that it did not support a particular side between the pro- and anti-government forces in Ukraine, least of all the participants in violent riots, and did not intend to besmirch the memory of Soviet veterans who had fought the Nazi regime invaders during World War II. The protests against the Oresharski cabinet are believed to have provided new fuel to the debates regarding the perceived Russophilic vs. Russophobic schism within Bulgarian society and the role of Bulgaria's European Union membership in changing the nature of its relations with Russia.|$|R
5000|$|Cable {{television}} in Romania {{was introduced in}} 1991, although some small cable networks were established before 1990, usually amateur made equipment, serving small communities, and receiving about 8-12 foreign channels, but with no translation, and usually at low quality, however, like in other East European countries before 1989, most people were having monochrome sets, therefore, low quality was not very important [...] After 1990, cable networks were expanding and penetrating the market, new or second hand cable equipment were achieved by providers. Channels like Cartoon Network, <b>Euronews,</b> Discovery <b>Channel,</b> MTV and many other channels like Italian, German or French channels were of high interest, many people subscribed fairly cheap to cable television. This expansion and penetration continues to the present day. Cable {{television in}} Romania has a high penetration, over 75% of households being subscribed to a cable television supplier, and lately, all cable television operators are providing internet access and telephony. RCS&RDS, and UPC Romania are the largest providers, and are present in most areas of Romania, {{but there are also}} many other smaller cable providers, which are operating locally regionally and are serving some local communities, cities, districts or some counties, and are also offering internet access. In fact, internet access in Romania is mainly granted (for home use, but even for business use) by cable TV operators. Cable television is mainly analogue, and is offered by all cable television providers in Romania, providing between 40 and 70 channels (depending on the cable supplier and the number of local and regional channels), but lately, digital cable is becoming very popular, providing up to 160 channels (depending on the supplier and the number of regional and local channels). Some small providers are offering solely analogue cable television, although some of them are beginning to provide digital channels, and they modernized and improved their networks, for providing internet access with higher speeds and more digital programs. Analogue cable Television, still has a high demand, as there are still subscribers which have older CRT TV sets or Plasma and LCD sets with no digital built-in tuner, {{and some of them are}} not interested in digital cable television, or willing to replace the TV very soon. Most must-carry channels are also available in Romania on analogue cable, also along with some foreign channels (like Viasat, Discovery, National Geographic, Paramount, etc.). Therefore, analogue cable television will continue to be provided for an undetermined period of time. However, unencrypted channels are available (depending on provider) if subscribing to an analogue service. Cable television in Romania is fairly cheap.|$|R
40|$|In his {{discourse}} about Europe and the European project pronounced on 22 nd February 2013 at the Bellevue Palace in Berlin, German Bundespräsident Joachim Gauck has articulated his {{view on the}} future development of the European polity, reinstating {{the idea of a}} public sphere extended to all member states and their populations. As already noted by Maria Kyriakidou in an earlier post on this blog, this call for a European public sphere is not a particularly new, nor original idea. It has already been explored, both in intellectual debates and in some practical applications (e. g. the TV <b>channels</b> <b>Euronews</b> and partially ARTE), at least from the 1990 s. Many will remember the article “After the War: the Rebirth of Europe” (Nach dem Krige: Der Wiedergeburt Europas) by Jürgen Habermas and Jacques Derrida, published ten years ago in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In that contribution, Habermas and Derrida celebrated the birth of a European public sphere (Öffentlichkeit), and advanced a series of proposals for the accelerated integration of a core of European countries (Kerneuropa), which should have effectively amounted {{to the creation of a}} European federal state. Ten years on, it is impossible not to read that article as overly optimistic not only about the process of European integration as carried out by political leaders, but also with reference to the existence of a European public sphere. Gauck’s speech is in this sense the admission that little progress was made during the last decade in the direction which was predicted then, and that we are effectively back to square one with regard to an enhanced process of European unification...|$|R
