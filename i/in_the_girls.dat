5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The film {{can be seen as}} having another loose aspect to labor issues. The film directly followed first Thanhouser film to address the subject: The Girl Strike Leader. The film loosely refers labor relations when Jack Hunt is killed in a riot while on strike duty and the young widow is struggles to make ends meet. Thanhouser subjects would deal with other pressing social issues <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Girls</b> of the Ghetto, another July 1910 release. The plot of The Lucky Shot employed the deus ex machina technique to resolve the financial needs of the widow and her child. Another plot of a needy family suddenly finding a concealed fortune within their house would be reused in The Thunderbolt. The film director and the cameraman are unknown and the only credits known for the cast is that of Marie Eline as the little boy and Mrs. George W. Walters {{in the role of the}} miserly woman. Other members cast may have included the other leading players of the Thanhouser productions, Anna Rosemond, Frank H. Crane and Violet Heming.|$|E

2500|$|While Cassie and Thelma strategize, new {{characters}} are introduced {{at the school}} while old ones depart. Troy, convinced that Cassie's child is his, left the school {{at the end of}} the first series. Jo Watkins, having [...] "really let herself go," [...] is seldom seen at school as she has become Azazeal's live-in nurse and nanny. The school gains a new chaplain, Jez Heriot, who doesn't [...] "wear the uniform" [...] except when conducting services and also teaches Ethics. When Jo effectively disappears, David Tyrel asks Jez to take her classes as well. The students don't initially realize that he is a priest, and Roxanne is quite taken with him, so much so that she can't help but seduce him even after the truth is known. A new student arrives at Medenham: Ella Dee. Her wardrobe instantly wins her points with the boys, evokes jealousy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls,</b> and makes the faculty uncomfortable. Thelma is mildly attracted until she realizes that Ella can see her. There are other anomalies: Ella's tuition is paid by a corporation and her family background is unknown. She also seems to know entirely too much about Cassie... and Azazeal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{time is the}} present. Following {{some time}} {{teaching}} in Winnebago, Wisconsin, Bertram Cope, 24, arrives at the University to spend a year as an instructor in English literature.

At an afternoon tea, he makes a favorable impression on Mrs. Medora Phillips, the wealthy widow of an art dealer, and Basil Randolph, an [...] "academic manqué," [...] a stockbroker and a collector of books and curiosities. Phillips sees Cope as an interesting addition to her salons. Randolph sees him as a candidate for mentoring. Cope visits Mrs. Phillips at home and she continues a conversational style Cope describes as [...] "pretending to quarrel as a means of entertaining you."(24) Though Cope says little of note and sings several airs without distinction, he is judged favorably. Mrs. Phillips teases him for lacking any interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls</b> she introduces to him. Randolph, who occasionally entertains undergraduates [...] "who readily forgot and quickly dropped you,"(40) researches Cope's background and discusses him with Mrs. Phillips, concluding that Cope has [...] "more than one touch of gentility."(42) Randolph visits Mrs. Phillips' wheelchair-using [...] tenant, Joe Foster, her late husband's half-brother, and learns that she imagines Cope may prove a match for one of the three girls who live in her house, Amy, Hortense, and Carolyn. From his quarters upstairs, Joe heard Cope's singing and was impressed enough to want to learn more of Cope. When Mrs. Phillips invites Randolph to a young people's dinner that will include Cope, he feels [...] "a slight stir of elation."(54) ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{first single}} was [...] "Long Hot Summer", {{released}} in August 2005 as a [...] "buzz" [...] track to regenerate interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>girls.</b> The song was earmarked for release {{on the soundtrack}} of the 2005 film [...] The plans fell through, but the music video had taken inspiration from the movie's car theme and Girls Aloud portrayed mechanics. The song wasn't as well received by critics, and it became their first single to miss the top five. The follow-up [...] "Biology" [...] was critically acclaimed and saw Girls Aloud return to the top five. Peter Cashmore, writing for The Guardian, described [...] "Biology" [...] as [...] "the best pop single of the last decade". In September 2006, the single followed {{in the footsteps of}} [...] "No Good Advice" [...] and [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] to become the winner of the Popjustice £20 Music Prize. Just four weeks after the release of [...] "Biology", Girls Aloud released a cover of Dee C. Lee's [...] "See the Day" [...] in the race for Christmas number one. It became their lowest charting single at the time. The song won the Heart Award at the O2 Silver Clef Lunch, an annual awards honouring songwriting and performance in aid of Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy. The final single from Chemistry was [...] "Whole Lotta History", which became their twelfth consecutive single to chart within the top ten. The video, filmed in Paris, France, was their first to be set on location and outside of the United Kingdom.

2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Girls</b> Aloud 2008 {{biography}} Roberts {{expressed an}} interest in writing and recording her own material, wanting to experiment in the studio for better understanding of the process. She then started work in the recording studio, with producers such as; Dragonette, Diplo and Joseph Mount. Roberts after a year of recording announced that she would be releasing her debut album, Cinderella's Eyes. The first single [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] had an on-sale release meaning it had little promotion beforehand and commercially it peaked at number 27 in the United Kingdom but critically it garnered acclaim from critics which Roberts described as [...] "amazing". A second single [...] "Lucky Day" [...] was released shortly after and whilst gaining positive reviews it failed to make an impact commercially peaking at number 40 in the UK. The album was then released on 23 September 2011, Roberts described the album as [...] "electronically lead", and the album was inspired by her time performing with Girls Aloud - [...] "It would have been stupid for me to make an album that meant nothing" [...] she said. For Roberts the album was about making a risky record, where there wasn't a guaranteed commercial success, explaining to The Guardian: [...] "It's taken every last bit of confidence just to release this record, or maybe I've just brainwashed myself into feeling more confident. I don't know if it's good, or if I've just told myself it's good." [...] The album was released to universal positive reviews from critics, reviewers such as Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of the Financial Times, James Lachno of The Daily Telegraph, Emily Mackay of NME, Hugh Montgomery of The Independent and others hailed it as the best solo record from a member of Girls Aloud. Commercially in the United Kingdom the album peaked at number 17 whilst on the Digital charts it peaked at number 13, in Scotland it charted at number 21 whilst in Ireland it peaked at number 48. On 6 January a third single from the album was released, titled [...] "Yo-Yo" [...] the song was described as a [...] "shining example of her pop sensibilities".|$|E
