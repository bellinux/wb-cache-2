40|$|A {{deficiency}} in the essential nutrient thiamine resulting from chronic alcohol consumption is one factor underlying alcohol-induced brain damage. Thiamine is a <b>helper</b> <b>molecule</b> (i. e., a cofactor) required by three enzymes involved in two pathways of carbohydrate metabolism. Because intermediate products of these pathways {{are needed for}} the generation of other essential molecules in the cells (e. g., building blocks of proteins and DNA as well as brain chemicals), a reduction in thiamine can interfere with numerous cellular functions, leading to serious brain disorders, including Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is found predominantly in alcoholics. Chronic alcohol consumption can result in thiamine deficiency by causing inadequate nutritional thiamine intake, decreased absorption of thiamine from the gastrointestinal tract, and impaired thiamine utilization in the cells. People differ in their susceptibility to thiamine deficiency, however, and different brain regions also may {{be more or less}} sensitive to this condition. KEY WORDS: thiamine deficiency; alcoholic brain syndrome; chronic AODE (alcohol and other drug effects); Wernicke’s encephalopathy; Wernicke-Korsakoff psychosis; alcoholic cerebellar degeneration; AODR (alcohol and other drug related) structural brain damage; malnutrition; disease susceptibility; survey of researc...|$|E
40|$|Genome {{comparison}} permits {{identification of}} chromosome regions conserved during evolution. Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli are so distant that there exists very few conserved landmarks in their genome organisation. Analysis of the conserved cmk rpsA cluster pinpointed {{the importance of}} cytosine nucleotide metabolism. In these bacteria, mRNA turnover provides an efficient means to fulfil the need for CDP as a precursor of DNA synthesis. The cmk rpsA operon is responsible for CDP synthesis. This function is self-explained {{in the case of}} the cmk gene (which codes for cytidylate kinase). The case of rpsA, that codes for ribosomal protein SI, is more subtle. It is suggested here that SI is a RNA-binding protein helping polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase, known to be phylogenetically related to SI) to degrade mRNA, or <b>helper</b> <b>molecule</b> involved in other RNase activities. This provides an explanation for the elusive function of PNPase, which generates nucleoside diphosphates (not monophosphates) when degrading RNA. This also accounts for the discovery that the B. subtilis comR gene product is PNPase. This article briefly discusses the availability of cytosine nucleotides in eukaryotes, and suggests that they are derived from phospholipids turnover. Finally, the GC content of genomes is discussed in this new light.

40|$|Targeted {{immunotherapy}} using dendritic cells (DCs) {{has been}} employed in numerous investigations aiming at combating neoplasms. We previously showed that copulsing of an antigen with a helper protein could considerably enhance antigen presenting capacity of ex vivo–generated DCs. In this study, {{we attempted to}} administer an effective treatment in a murine model of colon cancer with DCs pulsed with the mixture of a tumor-specific gp 70 -derived peptide (AH 1) and a helper protein, ovalbumin (OVA). Materials and Methods First, the presence of gp 70 in CT 26 tumor cells and tumor tissues was verified using immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses. Next, DCs were purified from normal mice, loaded ex vivo with AH 1 and OVA (DC-Pep-OVA), and injected into tumor-bearing mice. Tumor volume, in vitro antigen (Ag) -specific proliferation of splenic cells, and survival rate were measured to determine the efficacy of DC-Pep-OVA. As the control groups, tumor-bearing mice were vaccinated with DC-Pep, unpulsed DC, and DCs loaded {{with a mixture of}} OVA and an irrelevant peptide (P 15), or were not vaccinated at all. Results DC-Pep-OVA showed superior efficacy over other groups, as indicated by smaller tumor volume, higher Ag-specific proliferation rate of splenic cells, and prolonged survival. Conclusion Overall, in the present study we showed {{for the first time that}} DCs copulsed with AH 1 (tumor Ag) and OVA (<b>helper</b> <b>molecule)</b> could be considered as potentially robust weapons for use in future antitumor immunotherapies.

In perspective, this type of formulation {{may be used for}} oil spill dispersions.

50|$|Many cofactors (non-protein-based <b>helper</b> <b>molecules)</b> feature thiols. The {{biosynthesis}} {{and degradation}} of fatty acids and related long-chain hydrocarbons is conducted on a scaffold that anchors the growing chain through a thioester {{derived from the}} thiol Coenzyme A. The biosynthesis of methane, the principal hydrocarbon on Earth, arises from the reaction mediated by coenzyme M, 2-mercaptoethyl sulfonic acid. Thiolates, the conjugate bases derived from thiols, form strong complexes with many metal ions, especially those classified as soft. The stability of metal thiolates parallels that of the corresponding sulfide minerals.|$|R
30|$|Our {{abstract}} cell is a spherical ball which encloses a fluid called cytoplasm. The {{surface of}} the ball is actually a membrane with an inner and outer part. Outside the cell there is a solution called the extracellular fluid. Both the cytoplasm and extracellular fluid contain many molecules, polypeptides and proteins disassociated into ions as well as sequestered into storage units. We are now interested in what this biological membrane is {{and how we can}} model the flow of ionized species through it. This modeling is difficult because some of the ions we are interested in can diffuse or drift across the membrane and others must be allowed entry through specialized holes in the membrane called gates or even escorted, i.e. transported or pumped, through the membrane by specialized <b>helper</b> <b>molecules.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{hybridization}} {{of synthetic}} Streptococcus pneumoniae tmRNA on a detection microarray is slow at 34 °C {{resulting in low}} signal intensities. Results We demonstrate that adding specific DNA helper oligonucleotides (chaperones) to the hybridization buffer increases the signal strength at a given temperature and thus makes the specific detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae tmRNA more sensitive. No loss of specificity was observed at low temperatures compared to hybridization at 46 °C. The effect of the chaperones {{can be explained by}} disruption of the strong secondary and tertiary structure of the target RNA by the selective hybridization of <b>helper</b> <b>molecules.</b> The amplification of the hybridization signal strength by chaperones is not necessarily local; we observed increased signal intensities in both local and distant regions of the target molecule. Conclusions The sensitivity of the detection of tmRNA at low temperature can be increased by chaperone oligonucleotides. Due to the complexity of RNA secondary and tertiary structures the effect of any individual chaperone is currently not predictable. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe folding of {{proteins}} can be assisted by two unrelated groups of <b>helper</b> <b>molecules.</b> Chaperones suppress non-productive side reactions by stoichiometric binding to folding intermediates, and folding enzymes catalyze slow rate-limiting steps of folding. We reinvestigated, whether peptidyl-propyl-cis/trans-isomerases of the cyclophilin type act simultaneously as chaperones and as folding catalysts in the reactivation of human carbonic anhydrase II, as reported recently [Freskgård, P. -O et al. (1992) Science 258, 466 – 468; Rinfret, A. et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 1668 – 1673]. No {{increase in the}} yield of carbonic anhydrase-II could be detected {{in the presence of}} three different propyl isomerases, when reactivation was followed by a sensitive assay for an extended time of 4 h. We conclude that the role of propyl isomerases in the refolding of carbonic anhydrase can be explained solely by their isomerase activity. There is no need to invoke simultaneous functions as chaperones for these folding catalysts...|$|R
40|$|Neutrophil {{chemokine}} receptor expression can {{be altered}} by exposure to Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, {{a process that is}} thought to have the potential to localize neutrophils to sites of infection. In order to investigate this process in more detail, we examined the regulation of highly pure neutrophil CXCR 1 and CXCR 2 expression and function by selective agonists of TLR 2 (Pam 3 CSK 4) and TLR 4 (lipopolysaccharide, LPS). CXCR 1 and CXCR 2 were down-regulated by TLR engagement. CXCR 2 loss was more rapid and showed a dependence upon soluble <b>helper</b> <b>molecules</b> (LPS binding protein and CD 14) that was not evident for CXCR 1, suggesting differential coupling of LPS signalling to CXCR 1 and CXCR 2 loss. However, TLR engagement in highly pure neutrophils did not result in complete loss of chemokine receptors, and LPS-treated neutrophils remained able to mount a respiratory burst to CXCL 8 and CXCL 1, and were able to migrate towards CXCL 8 in assays of under-agarose chemotaxis. Thus, although treatment of purified human neutrophils with TLR 2 and TLR 4 agonists modifies chemokine receptor expression, remaining receptors remain functionally competent...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} gene {{regulation}} and expression is often discussed in quantitative terms. In particular, {{the expression of}} genes is regularly characterized with respect to how much, how fast, when and where. Whether discussing the level of gene expression in a bacterium or its precise location within a developing embryo, the natural language for these experiments is that of numbers. Such quantitative data demands quantitative models. We review a class of models ("thermodynamic models") which exploit statistical mechanics to compute the probability that RNA polymerase is at the appropriate promoter. This provides a mathematically precise elaboration {{of the idea that}} activators are agents of recruitment which increase the probability that RNA polymerase will be found at the promoter of interest. We discuss a framework which describes the interactions of repressors, activators, <b>helper</b> <b>molecules</b> and RNA polymerase using the concept of effective concentrations, expressed in terms of a function we call the "regulation factor". This analysis culminates in an expression for the probability of RNA polymerase binding at the promoter of interest {{as a function of the}} number of regulatory proteins in the cell. In a companion paper [1], these ideas are applied to several case studies which illustrate the use of the general formalism. Comment: 11 pages and 4 figures in PDF forma...|$|R
40|$|Because of its unusual length, nascent {{thyroglobulin}} (Tg) {{requires a}} long time after translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to assume its mature tertiary structure. Thus, Tg is an ideal molecule for the study of protein folding and export from the ER, and is an excellent potential substrate for molecular chaperones. During the first 15 min after biosynthesis, Tg is found in transient aggregates with and without interchain disulfide bonds, which precede the formation of free monomers (and ultimately dimers) within the ER. By immunoprecipitation, newly synthesized Tg was associated with the binding protein (BiP); association was maximal at the earliest chase times. Much of the Tg released from BiP by the addition of Mg-ATP was found in aggregates containing interchain disulfide bonds; other BiP- associated Tg represented non-covalent aggregates and unfolded free monomers. Importantly, the immediate precursor to Tg dimer was a compact monomer which did not associate with BiP. The average stoichiometry of BiP/Tg interaction involved nearly 10 BiP molecules per Tg molecule. Cycloheximide was used to reduced the ER concentration of Tg relative to chaperones, with subsequent removal of the drug in order to rapidly restore Tg synthesis. After this treatment, nascent Tg aggregates were no longer detectable. The data suggest a model of folding of exportable proteins in which nascent polypeptides immediately upon translocation into the ER interact with BiP. Early interaction with BiP may help in presenting nascent polypeptides to other <b>helper</b> <b>molecules</b> that catalyze folding, thereby preventing aggregation or driving aggregate dissolution in the ER...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the project}} has {{received}} heavy criticism as it claims to have created a synthetic organism. This claim arises {{from the fact that}} the genome was synthesized chemically in many pieces (a synthetic method), joined together by means of molecular biological techniques (an artificial method), and transplanted into the cytoplasm of a natural cell (after a few generations, though, the original protein content is undetectable).The two species used as donor and recipient are of the same genus as the more distant two species are, the less the correct protein interactions are maintained, such as binding factors and binding sites, which mutate together (epistasis). Consequently, Paul Keim (a molecular geneticist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff) notes that [...] "there are great challenges ahead before genetic engineers can mix match, and fully design an organism's genome from scratch" [...] due to this issue.DNA is the template for protein construction and requires proteins as <b>helper</b> <b>molecules</b> to do so, a chicken-and-egg conundrum solved by the RNA world hypothesis, consequently synthetic naked DNA would require several proteins to create a viable cell. In 2000 and 2002 teams synthesized replicating hepatitis C virus (about 9600 nucleotides long) and poliovirus (about 7500 nucleotides long), [...] Viruses, however, replicate by utilising host protein expression machinery. Furthermore, whereas DNA can easily be replicated (using DNA polymerase), transcribed (using RNA polymerase), and translated (using ribosomes and many other factors)—all in vitro, such reactions, so far, utilise cell extracts and most components have not been synthesized de novo—that is from inorganic or synthetically made organic chemicals only.|$|R

This vaccine vector is composed of a self-replicating RNA containing all of the VEE nonstructural genes and cis-acting elements and also a heterologous immunogen gene placed downstream of the subgenomic 26 S promoter {{in place of the}} viral structural genes. In this study, the nontoxic 50 -kDa carboxy-terminal fragment (HC) of the BoNT/A heavy chain was cloned into the replicon vector (HC-replicon).

40|$|The {{spectrum}} of immune reactivity of T lymphocytes {{seems to be}} skewed toward anti-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 reactivity when {{compared to that of}} B cells. T lymphocytes are thus known to display striking reactivity toward the major histocompatibility-locus alloantigens as measured in mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC) (1), graft-versus-host reaction (2 - 4) or by using anti-idiotype antibodies when to determine the actual numbers of T cells participating in such reactions (5). No similar preoccupation has been noted for B lymphocytes (5). It is, in this context, quite crucial to relate the high number of alloreactive T lymphocytes with the recently described self-MHC reactivity displayed by helper or killer T lymphocytes (6 - 8). Here, both helper and killer cells display clonally distributed receptors for self-MHC <b>molecules</b> (<b>helper</b> cells for self-Ia) (6) and killer lymphocytes for certain types of beta 2 microglobulin-containing MHC structures (7, 8).

5|$|Helper T cells express T {{cell receptors}} (TCR) that {{recognize}} antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules. The MHC:antigen complex is also {{recognized by the}} helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) {{that are responsible for}} the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200–300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen <b>molecule.</b> <b>Helper</b> T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the seven}} flavivirus nonstructural {{proteins}} (NS 1 to NS 5) encoded in the distal two-thirds of the RNA positive-sense genome {{are believed to be}} essential components of RNA replication complexes. To explore the functional relationships of these components in RNA replication, we used trans-complementation analysis of full-length infectious RNAs of Kunjin (KUN) virus with a range of lethal in-frame deletions in the nonstructural coding region, using as helper a repBHK cell line stably producing functional replication complexes from KUN replicon RNA. Recently we showed that replication of KUN RNAs with large carboxy-terminal deletions including the entire RNA polymerase region in the NS 5 gene, representing 34 to 75 % of the NS 5 coding content, could be complemented after transfection into repBHK cells. In this study we have demonstrated that KUN RNAs with deletions of 84 to 97 % of the NS 1 gene, or of 13 to 63 % of the NS 3 gene including the entire helicase region, were also complemented in repBHK cells with variable efficiencies. In contrast, KUN RNAs with deletions in any of the other four nonstructural genes NS 2 A, NS 2 B, NS 4 A, and NS 4 B were not complemented. We have also demonstrated successful trans complementation of KUN RNAs containing either combined double deletions in the NS 1 and NS 5 genes or triple deletions in the NS 1, NS 3, and NS 5 genes comprising as much as 38 % of the entire nonstructural coding content. Based on these and our previous complementation results, we have generated a map of cis- and trans-acting elements in RNA replication for the nonstructural coding region of the flavivirus genome. These results are discussed in the context of our model on formation and composition of the flavivirus replication complex, and we suggest molecular mechanisms by which functions of some defective components of the replication complex can be complemented by their wild-type counterparts expressed from another (<b>helper)</b> RNA <b>molecule...</b>|$|R
