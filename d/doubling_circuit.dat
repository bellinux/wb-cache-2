The simulation was performed on a 132 kV line <b>double</b> <b>circuit</b> for economic installation of transmission line arresters (TIAs).

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{behaviour}} of a distance relay on a <b>double</b> <b>circuit</b> transmission line is analyzed and simulated using EMTDC/PSCAD software. The {{positive and negative}} sequence couplings between two <b>circuits</b> of a <b>double</b> <b>circuit</b> transmission line are small and negligible. However, the zero sequence coupling is not small. Indeed, if the zero sequence coupling is not compensated in impedance calculations, distance relay may either seriously overreach or underreach under different operational situations. These maloperations become more severe specially in {{the case that the}} two networks connected {{to the ends of the}} protected lines have extraordinary different equivalent impedances. Under these conditions if the zero sequence mutual coupling is not compensated, distance relay operation would not be reliable. However, in the compensated scheme relay performance is acceptably improved and the impedance estimated by the relay is close to the actual value. In this paper, a <b>double</b> <b>circuit</b> transmission line is simulated and operation and setting of line protective distance relay is analyzed by simulation. Mathematical analysis also confirms the results of simulations. The same results are also valid for two transmission lines in close proximity...|$|R
