5000|$|Meeps: These are red <b>furballs,</b> {{ranging in}} size from tennis ball to bowling ball in diameter. Like another alien {{fuzzball}} envisioned by Gerrold, they reproduce very quickly, and possess many traits which induce adoration in other species. In the wild, mother animals of many species will actually abandon their young in order to take care of meeps — a potent adaptation indeed. Some scientists speculate that the bunnydogs essentially rely on the same tactic as the meeps in a sense: they are so disarmingly cute, literally resembling living teddy bears, that humans are reluctant to attack them.|$|R

50|$|After they {{question}} Smorkus Flinders (a muscle-bound alien from Dimension X) {{and learn}} something of BKR's current plan, Rod is contacted again {{by his friend}} Snout, master of the mental arts. Partly inspired by this contact, Grakker (the ship's commander) decides to break off from the Galactic Patrol {{and head for the}} Mentat instead, the school where Snout became a master of the Mental Arts (incidentally, the building is one big PLANT). There, he hopes to find a clue that could lead them to their fallen friend. During the journey, Grakker reveals some of his past, including how he got to know both Snout and BKR.

5000|$|In {{the fourth}} Legion of Super-Heroes series, Timber Wolf is {{revealed}} {{to have been}} reduced to a giant and mindless dog-like creature named <b>Furball,</b> by new Legion member Kono. The transformation was caused by Doctor Regulus, who blasted Timber Wolf with a dose of radiation during his attempt to destroy the sun in the unseen storyline [...] "Black Dawn". The Legion hid Brin's identity from most due to a desire to protect his friends from finding out what had become of him; when a young girl named Gemini discovered this, she [...] "rescued" [...] Brin from his teammates as they traveled the galaxy in search of Darkseid (who was holding Gemini's brother hostage). Intrigued by Gemini's kindness towards Brin, Darkseid restored Brin to normal in exchange for Gemini killing Darkseid. Brin returned the Legion, horrified at their treatment of him and fled using a time machine back to the 20th Century. There he befriended the [...] "New Blood" [...] super-hero Jamm and was experimented on again by mad scientists who sought to create their own [...] "Timber Wolf". The process transformed Brin again, making him physically wolflike (with brownish black skin limited fur on his body) but allowed him to retain his mind. Timber Wolf returned to the future and ultimately reconciled with the Legion.|$|E
