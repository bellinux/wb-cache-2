40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} answer a disarmingly simple question: what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> to use an Etruscan pot? <b>It</b> <b>does</b> so through the {{development}} of a new methodology for ceramic analysis, created from a practical application of phenomenological thought to the Etruscan archaeological record. The Etruscan world of the Archaic period, approximately 650 to 450 BCE, would have been filled with images, colours, and sensations, fragments of all of which remain wrapped up in the pottery which was deposited in tombs and on domestic sites throughout the period. By analysing the experience of using such vessels, the thesis goes on to develop new interpretations of the role of pots and their contents in Etruscan society, particularly the Etruscan use of alcohol and the structure of formal feasting events. The presence of new pottery forms, with novel imagery imported from the Greek Eastern Mediterranean, provides a comparison which drives the analysis. By re-conceptualising these iconic imports as foci for Etruscan experiences, the relationship between these predominantly Attic ceramics and their Etruscan users is recast to emphasise the contrasts in ceramic usage brought in by these new vessels, and the shifts in behaviour, belief and banqueting that potentially accompanied them...|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the Higgs boson made headlines around the world. Two scientists, Peter Higgs and Francois Englert, whose theories predicted its existence, shared a Nobel Prize.

But what really is a Higgs boson and what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>do?</b> How was <b>it</b> found? And how has its discovery changed our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature? And what <b>did</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> to be part of it? Jon Butterworth {{is one of the leading}} physicists at CERN and this book is the first popular inside account of the hunt for the Higgs. It is a story of incredible scientific collaboration, inspiring technological innovation and ground-breaking science. It is also the story of what happens when the world's most expensive experiment blows up, of neutrinos that may or may not travel faster than light, and the reality of life in an underground bunker in Switzerland. This book will also leave you with a working knowledge of the new physics and what the {{discovery of}} the Higgs particle means for how we define the laws of nature.

5000|$|Duritz {{has said}} that the song is [...] "about the best thing I've written in my life. It's an epic story of two kids from New York in the late '70s and their lives Basin Park. It's about taking a look at your life {{and trying to figure out}} how you got here when you were there. It's also about Reno in 1910 and the story of Jack Johnson {{knocking}} out Jim Jeffries, who ends up lying on the ground looking at the sky thinking he’s not sure how this happened, how am I here? I was there. It starts as a story about that, then changes to be about these kids and their lives and how they changed. It's the best thing I've ever written, very heartfelt." [...] Duritz expanded on a 2014 episode of Acoustic Café: [...] "I started writing this song and initially it was about a guy and a girl growing up in the '60s and '70s. I started to write about their lives, but then when we got to... the verse after the first chorus. 'You walk into the bar like some Saturday star stud straight on spiked heels and needles and nerves.' I really started to get this idea about them cross-dressing. Well at least the guy dressing up in woman's clothes. So the songs very informed about that, about people living on the fringes and trying things just cause it's interesting to try things in life. I mean cause they're interested in what's over the next hill. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> to dress up in woman's clothes when you’re a guy? You know, it's nothing to do with being gay or not being gay. It's just what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> to be different?" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{generally}} received positively from music critics. Pop Justice praised the song, based just on its demo. [...] "We like this.

We particularly like the line that sounds like 'why <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> a cow?'." [...] The website listed the song as the fourth best song from Scherzinger. Brad Stern of MTV Buzworthy praised the song for its production. [...] "'Try with Me' is a gorgeous combination of pulsating synthesizers and slammin' vocals, and if she times this one right, there's no way Scherzy can't claw {{her way back to}} the top overseas."

[...] In response to the obvious influences Tom Waits, The Clash, The Supremes and most notably Bruce Springsteen have had on their previous records, he went on to add [...] "This record is really the one where we said, ‘All right, well, we’ve got our influences.

5000|$|The song is sung by Billy Elliot in {{the stage}} {{production}} at his audition {{for a place}} at The Royal Ballet School in London.

Describes dancing as [...] "Something that you can't control". After two verses, each with a chorus, Billy leaps into a frenetic dance; in this dance many skills such as acrobatics are used (the rhythm for this section of the instrumental varies from Billy to Billy, depending on each actor's dance strengths). The number concludes with another verse and Billy doing several pirouettes or tumbles. The most notable lyric in this piece is that of the title: 'Electricity sparks inside of me and I'm free, I'm free!" [...] It was inspired by the scene in the film, which it follows closely, in which Billy describing dancing as [...] "Electricity". His passion, shown in his description, is the implied reason for Billy's acceptance into The Royal Ballet School.|$|E
5000|$|... "Let It Go" [...] was {{the first}} song written by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez for the film that made it in, since songs {{composed}} earlier were eventually cut. The story outline they were given had a place reserved for [...] "Elsa's Badass Song", which was what {{they were trying to}} write. The duo took inspiration from the songs of the Disney Renaissance such as The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast and various artists including Adele, Aimee Mann, Avril Lavigne (whose 2002 debut album was titled Let Go), Lady Gaga, and Carole King. The song finally began to gel one day as the couple walked together from their home in Park Slope to nearby Prospect Park while they were [...] "thinking from an emo kind of place." [...] Anderson-Lopez explained what happened next: [...] "We went for a walk in Prospect Park and threw phrases at each other. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> to be the perfect exalted person, but only because you've held back this secret? Bobby came up with 'kingdom of isolation,' and it worked." [...] Lopez was able to improvise the song's first four lines on the spot. Back at their home studio, they composed the rest of the song by alternating between improvising melodies on a piano and brainstorming lyrics on a whiteboard, and finished it within a single day.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we expand {{the notion of}} {{embodied}} literary experience (Sumara, 2003) in order to represent human consciousness as a bio-cultural symbiosis that both participates in the acts of reading, viewing and response, {{and at the same}} time, is potentially transformed by those acts. Yet within education, certain uninterrogated assumptions continue to underlie a common (folk psychological) understanding of consciousness – what it is, what <b>it</b> <b>does,</b> what <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like.</b> These assumptions, in turn, shape the way collective experiences with literature are structured in the classroom in predominantly implicit ways. A theory of embodied literary experience aligned with recent studies in consciousness allows us to identify the kinds of reading practices that are necessary for navigating the multimodal “communicational landscape” (Kress, 2003) characteristic of contemporary popular culture. We suggest that lingering assumptions concerning human consciousness may be limiting the transformative possibilities inherent in various literary experiences within the classroom...|$|R
