50|$|An economical, {{environmentally}} {{benign and}} fast synthesis methodology for gold nanoparticles using block copolymer {{has been developed}} by Sakai et al. In this synthesis methodology, block copolymer plays the dual role of a reducing agent {{as well as a}} stabilizing agent. The formation of gold nanoparticles comprises three main steps: reduction of <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> ion by block copolymers in the solution and formation of gold clusters, adsorption of block copolymers on gold clusters and further reduction of <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> ions on the surfaces of these gold clusters for the growth of gold particles in steps, and finally its stabilization by block copolymers. But this method usually has a limited-yield (nanoparticle concentration), which does not increase with the increase in the <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> concentration. Recently, Ray et al. demonstrated that the presence of an additional reductant (trisodium citrate) in 1:1 mole ratio with <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> enhances the yield by manyfold at ambient conditions and room temperature.|$|R
40|$|The Turkevich-Frens {{synthesis}} starting {{conditions are}} expanded, ranging the <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> concentrations up to 2 mM and citrate/gold(III) molar ratios up to 18 : 1. For each {{concentration of the}} initial <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> solution, the citrate/gold(III) molar ratios are systematically varied from 2 : 1 to 18 : 1 and both the size and size distribution of the resulting gold nanoparticles are compared. This study reveals a different nanoparticle size evolution for <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> solutions ranging below 0. 8 mM compared {{to the case of}} <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> solutions above 0. 8 mM. In the case of Au 3 +] = 0. 8 mM, the size and size distribution of the synthesized gold nanoparticles continuously rise as the citrate/gold(III) ratio is increased. A starting <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> concentration of 0. 6 mM leads to the formation of the most monodisperse gold nanoparticles (polydispersity index< 0. 1) {{for a wide range of}} citrate/gold(III) molar ratios (from 4 : 1 to 18 : 1). Via a model for the formation of gold nanoparticles by the citrate method, the experimental trends in size could be qualitatively predicted:the simulations showed that the destabilizing effect of increased electrolyte concentration at high initial Au 3 +] is compensated by a slight increase in zeta potential of gold nanoparticles to produce concentrated dispersion of gold nanoparticles of small sizes...|$|R

40|$|A sorbent {{based on}} gold {{nanoparticles}} deposited by direct reduction of a <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> on a structured carbon surface has {{been prepared to}} be used in the mercury capture at low concentrations. A total of 13 samples have been obtained varying preparation conditions (stirring rate, <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> concentration and contact time). A kinetic study of the gold reduction on the carbon surface has been carried out, indicating that the calculated reaction rate constant corresponds to the diffusion rate equation. The study of the influence of <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> concentration on the reduction potential of the gold showed that the use of a high concentration <b>gold</b> <b>salt</b> solution shifts the reduction reaction to gold reduction. Mercury capture capacity cannot be directly related with either gold content or average particle size or average crystal size, but the study of the grain size distribution can explain the mercury capture performance of the samples.
