5|$|Upper Paleolithic people {{specialized}} in organized, <b>group</b> <b>hunting</b> of large mammals; they sometimes pursued and drove entire herds into traps. Their nutritional needs were met largely by meat consumption, as the vegetation {{was limited to}} tundra and steppe and the land was covered by ice and snow (Vistula final glaciation) for long periods. More sophisticated tool making methods resulted {{in the production of}} long (some over two feet), narrow and sharp flintstone splits. In a cave near Nowy Targ (East-Gravettian culture), a 30,000-year-old boomerang, the world's oldest, was found. It is a crescent-shaped 70cm long object with a fine finish, made of mammoth tusk. Mammoths were hunted in the Kraków area during 25,000-20,000 BCE. Also 30,000 years old are the so-called Mladeč-type blades of the Aurignacian culture, made of bone, found in Wierzchowie, Kraków County.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the <b>group</b> <b>hunting</b> down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies on a man who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E
5|$|Though Kentrosaurus likely {{stood with}} forelimbs erect like in other dinosaurs, it is {{hypothesised}} {{that the animal}} adopted a sprawling posture when defending itself. Its neck was flexible enough {{to allow it to}} keep sight of predators, as it could reach the sides of its body with its snout and look over the back. In addition, the posterior position of the center of mass may not have been advantageous for rapid locomotion, but meant that the animal could quickly rotate around the hips by pushing sideways with the arms, keeping the tail pointed at the attacker. Kentrosaurus was nevertheless not invulnerable. A quick predator could have made it to the tail base (where the impact speed would be much lower) when the tail passed and the neck and upper-part of the body would have been unprotected by the tail swings. A successful predation of Kentrosaurus may have required <b>group</b> <b>hunting.</b> Compared to the more robust spikes of Stegosaurus, the thinner spikes of Kentrosaurus were at greater risk of bending.|$|E

25|$|Organized open-boat shore whaling {{began in}} the 1570s; and {{continued}} into the early 20th century. Techniques were developed in the 17th century in Taiji, Wakayama. Wada Chubei Yorimoto established a fishery by organizing the <b>group</b> <b>hunting</b> system in 1606. Whalers would spot whales from stations along the shore and launch boats to catch them with harpoons and lances. His grandson, Wada Kakuemon Yoriharu, later known as Taiji Kakuemon Yoriharu, invented the whaling net technique called amitori-shiki (網取り式).|$|E
25|$|Outdoor {{recreation}} {{is popular}} in the region year-round. In summer, fishing, boating, canoeing, ATVing, and camping are enjoyed by residents. Hunting remains popular in autumn, especially for moose, whitetail deer, and grouse, although goose hunting is exceptionally popular near James Bay. <b>Group</b> <b>hunting</b> for moose is a favourite social outing. In winter, snowmobiling, ice fishing, outdoor shinny, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing are popular activities. The region boasts extensive snowmobiling trails and many lakes are dotted with ice hut villages throughout the winter.|$|E
500|$|Young lions first display {{stalking}} behaviour {{around three}} months of age, although they {{do not participate in}} hunting until they are almost a year old. They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two. Single lions are capable of bringing down prey like zebra and wildebeest, which can be twice their own weight, while hunting larger prey like giraffes and buffalo alone is too much of a risk. Cooperative-hunting lions are usually successful. In prides, lionesses do most of the hunting. In typical hunts, each lioness has a favoured position in the group, either stalking prey on the [...] "wing" [...] then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses. Males attached to prides do not usually participate in <b>group</b> <b>hunting.</b> However, some evidence suggests that pride males are just as successful as females; they are solo hunters who ambush prey in small bush. Lions are not particularly known for their stamina – for instance, a lioness' heart makes up only 0.57% of her body weight (a male's is about 0.45% of his body weight), whereas a hyena's heart is close to 1% of its body weight. Thus, they only run fast in short bursts, and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack. They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.|$|E

2500|$|Hudson {{observed}} tribalism as a trope in [...] "Killer Within", {{which he}} {{ascribed to the}} reluctance of Maggie, Rick, {{and others in the}} group to allow Oscar and Axel into their clan. The Los Angeles Times journalist noted that these characters had been severed from the cultural and social fabric of their past civilization for so long that they have reverted to [...] "traveling in a small, tightly knit <b>group,</b> <b>hunting</b> and gathering, and regarding anyone who isn't part of their it as a deadly threat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the coral}} reefs of the Red Sea, roving coralgrouper that have spotted a small prey fish {{hiding in a}} crevice {{sometimes}} visit the sleeping hole of a giant moray and shake their head at the moray, and {{this seems to be}} an invitation to <b>group</b> <b>hunting</b> as the moray often swims away with the grouper, is led to the crevice where the prey hides, and proceeds to probe that crevice (which is too small to let the grouper in), either catching the prey by itself or flushing it into the open where the grouper grabs it. [...] The closely related coral trout also enrolls the help of moray eels in this way, and they only do so when the prey they seek is hidden in crevices, where only the eel can flush them. They also quickly learn to invite preferentially those individual eels that collaborate most often.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} animals to perform {{structured}} and coordinated hunts might suggest {{the possession of}} higher cognitive abilities. However, recent research shows that complex behaviour can arise from following several simple rules. The question rises whether <b>group</b> <b>hunts</b> arise by self-organization, where simple rules are sufficient and individuals interact by positive and negative feedback, or by leadership, where one individual initiates a hunt and coordinates his group members. This thesis provides a review on current thoughts on cooperation during <b>group</b> <b>hunts.</b> Hunting behaviour of several vertebrates are discussed and attributed to self-organization or leadership. Leadership seems to explain the hunting behaviour of animals to which higher cognitive skills are attributed. Although the ability of an animal to perform cognitively demanding tasks {{does not mean that}} the executed behaviour arises from higher cognition. It is debatable if hunting behaviour is only distinguishable between self-organization and leadership. Possibly a gradient exist, where parts of the behaviour arise through self-organization and other parts through leadership...|$|R
