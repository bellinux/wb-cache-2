6000|$|... 'But {{still the}} Puritans were barbarians for hating Art altogether.' The fact was, that they hated what art {{they saw in}} England, {{and that this was}} low art, bad art, growing ever lower and worse. If it be said that Shakspeare's is the very highest art, the answer <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> hated in him was not his high art, but his low art, the foul and horrible {{elements}} which he had in common with his brother play-writers. True, there is far less of these elements in Shakspeare than in any of his compeers: but they are there. And what the Puritans hated in him was exactly what we have to expunge before we can now represent his plays. If it be said that they ought to have discerned and appreciated the higher elements in him, so ought the rest of their generation. The Puritans were surely not bound to see in Shakspeare what his patrons and brother poets did not see. And it is surely a matter of fact that the deep spiritual knowledge which makes, and will make, Shakspeare's plays (and them alone of all the seventeenth century plays) a heritage for all men and all ages, quite escaped the insight of his contemporaries, who probably put him in the same rank which Webster, writing about 1612, has assigned to him.|$|E
6000|$|The {{complexity}} of things among the Proberts, it needn't nevertheless startle us to learn, was such {{as to make}} it impossible for Gaston to proceed to the celebration of his nuptial, with all the needful circumstances of material preparation and social support, before some three months should have expired. He chafed however but moderately under this condition, for he remembered it would give Francie time to endear herself to his whole circle. It would also have advantages for the Dossons; it would enable them to establish by simple but effective arts some modus vivendi with that rigid body. It would in short help every one to get used to everything. Mr. Dosson's designs and Delia's took no articulate form; what was mainly clear to Gaston was that his future wife's relatives had as yet no sense of disconnexion. He knew that Mr. Dosson would do whatever Delia liked and that Delia would like to [...] "start" [...] her sister--this whether or no she expected to be present at the rest of the race. Mr. Probert notified Mr. Dosson of what he proposed to [...] "do" [...] for his son, and Mr. Dosson appeared more quietly amused than anything else at the news. He announced in return no intentions in regard to Francie, and his strange silence was the cause of another convocation of the house of Probert. Here Mme. de Brecourt's bold front won another victory; she maintained, as she let her brother know, that {{it was too late for}} any policy but a policy of confidence. [...] "Lord help us, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> call confidence?" [...] the young man gasped, guessing the way they all had looked at each other; and he wondered how they would look next at poor Mr. Dosson himself.

5000|$|APCo (the old {{spelling}} of APCO Worldwide) {{is completing}} its {{evaluation of a}} Symposium for Europe in the fall. They have forwarded the draft Guiding Scientific Principles (or GEP) which would constitute the outcome of such a meeting.They {{are on the right}} track but the language is too vague. (Tom) Borelli and (Richard) Carchman will review and tighten. Obviously, any output from the symposium must be supportive of GEP. So the bottom line for both the GEP resolution and GEP Symposium must be in synch. Burson (Marsteller) has begun its feasibility review based on a more explicit understanding that GEP is what we are interested in promoting.I gather from Jim of B-M {{that there may have been}} a misunderstanding as to whether or not Burson was to have proceeded with the review prior to the presentation of a [...] "joint" [...] proposal and B-M. I was aware that Burson began and take responsibility for allowing them to proceed. If you dont want to pay for it then I will. But the intelligence obtained from their interviews with potential coalition sponsors as well as information about analogous efforts by existing groups, e.g., Heidelberg, will be critical to the development of a comprehensive Burson/APCo proposal.: after a territory battle, Philip Morris had suggested that rivals APCO and B-M present this as a joint proposalThe Burson research is necessary now in order to tell us whether it is possible or efficient to try to develop an enduring Science coalition following on from the symposium. Possible, in that there may prove to be an insufficient amount of interest in the corporate sector for such a movement. Efficient, in that there may already exist analogous groups which we could use without going to the effort of starting one from scratch.And we need to be careful not to step on unseen toes. For example, Bruce Ames is part of TASSC and Heidelberg. Do we need/want him on a third group in Europe?Thus the benefit in having Burson complete the study now, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> learn will be factored into both the content of the symposium AND inform us as to what options are available after the symposium concludes. If we only want a one off event, thats our decision. But I would think wed at least want a mechanism to be able to tap the participants to later on endorse the GEP resolution in the appropriate EU institutions.The Burson research will also turn up corporate interest in GEP in general which may help us identify allies regardless of whether we do either a symposium or create a coalition. The presentation therefore at the next TF mtg. will be a single proposal for PM prepared jointly by Burson and APCo. And Ive asked Margery of APCO and Jim of B-M to come themselves, as well as any other support staff they may wish to have accompany them. http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/tid/fsd34e00/pdf ...|$|E

One of the main findings of Beckers et al.

Recently, Haselgrove (2010) has put forward an associative account of this phenomenon based on the Rescorla-Wagner model (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972). This associative account is based on the idea of a common element (p) shared by the cues A, B, C, D, E, and X resulting in the presentation of compound trials for each elemental cue presentation i. e., ap, bp, cp, dp, ep, xp, and cdp¹ for the compound CD (where a, b, c, d, e, and x represent the element that distinguished the cues used). This assumption was {{based on the fact that}} five of the six cues used were drawn from the same auditory modality, and the purported failure by Beckers et al. (2006) to demonstrate that "the cues used in pretraining and those used for blocking were represented by the rats as entirely different stimuli. ...|$|E

Collings later set up the Rural Labourers' League, which supported land reform and advocated tariffs on imported food to support the rural economy. Collings proposed a system of vocational education through free schools in rural areas. Erroneously or not, Collings along with Chamberlain and others believed that land reform in Ireland would give the peasants a stake in the country and reduce poverty, but convinced neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives to attempt it.|$|R

40|$|Translation begins] Thursday My Darling, Hope {{that this}} doesn’t get too blurred. But I just washed {{my hair and}} it’s {{dripping}} all over the place. Your letter came that you wrote last Sunday. Golly, honey, I hope March 11 th isn’t rainy too. My hair will look horid [sic] if it does. Right now I’m half listening to Suspense- very confusing. I always pick the nicest atmosphere to write to you, honey- very romantic! I guess that the train is just as slow as the bus, honey. We’ll stay in Atlanta Thursday night probably. So it’s hard to get hotel rooms, huh, honey? Well- that’s a minor detail, we can always find a nice park bench someplace. Honey, that’s the way I always wear my hair- parted {{on the side and}} flat on top- [?] when you were home, that’s the only time I changed it. Everyone else likes it this way, honey. Listen, Judson Clark- will you please answer my question about the Scotch? First- how many bottles {{do you want me to}} buy? And which is better- Pinch bottle or Johnny Walker? You’ve been avoiding my question about Steve. Is there anything wrong between you and sweetie? You never mention him? I’ve been asking and asking you if he was going to be able to arrive by two and if he was very far away. Those are the only two questions that I can think of off hand but if you don’t answer me so help me there’ll be a private war. Especially about the Scotch. Where are the other places that are more convenient? We should go to Mexico or someplace on the way. Of course Mexico is probably millions of miles away. But, how long will we be able to stay wherever we go? You said you wanted to go swimming but I don’t know. If we don’t have more than four or five days it wouldn’t make much difference to me- Remember? Yes, I guess I want you to be boss- I don’t know whether you will be or not. I’ve got a pretty strong mind of my own- All right so you’ll be an officer. There are plenty of other officers- and and [sic] you’ll take orders when necessary! So I’ll be a Colonel! I’m glad that you’re getting the rings. I’d never get it done. Never have time to look. If you like them, honey, I’m sure I will- You have such good taste. You’ll always have to buy my jewelry. Well, I wasn’t exactly trying to discourage you, honey, just sorta preparing you and letting you know what you’re getting in for. But, honey, we’ve got to eat. Golly, I just hate to think of what’s going to happen. You’re going to be awfully hungry. I hope after we’ve been married a while you still feel the same way. I’m not worrying at all about it but everyone else is- All you hear is “Poor Juddie”- Everyone is sure that I’m going to starve you to death or something horrible. Probably kill you from cooking- I’m definitely not the domestic type. Which is the best Johnny Walker, red or black? Well, honey all the articles I’ve read in magazines say that religion is terribly important and since we’re not religious, honey, I was wondering what would happen. I’m not worrying about it at all. I just thought you might like to worry about it. Everyone else seems to think things like that are important. Golly, honey, when we get married it will be the first time I’ve been in a church all this year! That’s awful. Yes, honey, I’m sure it will work out fine- But the experts all disagree. We’ll show them. Well, you see, I read anything that comes along + lately they’re publishing lots of stuff on war marriages and what makes them last + not last. I agree about the only way we can find out if it will work is by trying it. I’m not worried in the least but I want you to be sure that you’ve considered all angles. What a waste of time! Why can’t March hurry. Gee, honey, the way time drags you’d thing we had all year or something. Oh, happy day- (day after Valentine’s day but we got paid today. Tomorrow at noon I’ll take my huge check over to the bank. Hope they have enough money to cover it. (<b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do with checks?) Someone’s singing “There Goes That Song Again”. Gee, I miss you so, honey. Golly the time’s getting shorter. Only 24 more days now and we’ll be married, honey. As you’ve probably gathered by now I’m in a very wacky mood and if this letter makes sense it’s purely coincidental. Remember that night at Split Rock when you were getting decoldized- (new word!) Woody and Steve were ready to murder me- I always get wacky at the most inappropriate times. Golly, hone in eleven more days I’ll be all finished working. That’s eleven weekdays. Weekends don’t count. There are times when I dislike everything about that place but then other times I don’t mind it at all. I still feel real patriotic and everything. I don’t know whether I’ll be able to go back to modeling again. It’s so unessential. “To Have And Have Not” is at the movies this weekend. I can hardly wait to see it. Lauren Bacall is in it. I like her a lot. Won’t be able to see it until Monday night though. Tomorrow night I’m not going out. I’ll be a good little girl and write to you for a change. Forgot to buy some envelopes again. Oh well, maybe tomorrow I’ll remember. Gee, honey, I wish these 24 days would hurry. Have you found out about when the graduation dance will be? Can you get Charlotte a date? I should carry a pad + pencil around with me always so that when I think of something to ask you I could write it down and then remember- whenever I begin to write, always forget. Let’s see honey, what else was there that I wanted to ask you. Oh, how many hours have you flown now? Are ya still ahead of everyone? Are you still highest in your class or don’t you know? Gee, in about 14 more days you should know what you’re going to be. That’s 10 days before graduation. I’ll probably have pneumonia if I don’t dry my hair soon. It’s still all wet. Gee, honey, it will be so queer to be married. Since I’ve never been married before, I think it will be queer anyway. But being married to you will be wonderful, darling. Last Sunday seems months away. This week went so fast in a way but in another way it seems as if it had been going on forever. Oh, tomorrow’s Friday- I like Fridays. Honey, will we go on our honeymoon right after we’re married or what? Do you get the 15 days right away. No, don’t tell me that. But where are we going? Let’s not go where it’s rainy- that would be very wetish and – wait a minute- that wouldn’t be so bad- It would be very romantic. Remember that day we walked in the rain, honey. That sure was a long time ago. Well, my darling, I guess I’d better dry my hair and take a bath and get to bed. I love you more than anything else in the world. You’re so sweet, honey, how can anyone be so wonderful. Well, honey, until we’re together again, I’ll love you, Always, Dottie P. S. Please answer my questions!!! [Translation ends...|$|E
