25|$|Questions {{were raised}} {{on why the}} SS Uganda {{did not come to}} give {{assistance}} when the distress rockets were fired. The captain of the ship, Captain Kilpatrick, stated that he thought the lights were from Troubridge Island Lighthouse, and were not distress signals; as a result, he continue on according to procedure. This excuse was challenged {{by the fact that the}} locals nearby could see and identify the lights as distress signals. Furthermore, one of the survivors stated that the SS Uganda did answer the distress signal by replying with an answering light. This suggests that they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was but did not came to help them.|$|E
500|$|Bruce Paterson of the Australian Film Critics Association {{gave the}} film 3 out of 5stars, writing that the {{generally}} poor reception {{for the film}} was [...] "a sad fate for a surprisingly sincere tribute to Robert Wise's 1951 classic." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times 'congratulated' Keanu Reeves's performance and wrote in his review that [...] "This contemporary remake of the science-fiction classic <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was doing when it cast Keanu Reeves, the movies' greatest stone face since Buster Keaton." ...|$|E
500|$|When it {{was seen}} that NVA forces were pouring through the gap unimpeded, the no-fire zone was reduced at 10:00p.m. that night, but not before the action {{generated}} considerable debate. One ranking adviser commented, [...] "When viewed in relation to all {{the events of the}} day, a worse decision could not have been made." [...] The 3rd ARVN had lost most of its artillery in the first two days of the offensive, and in fact had surrendered two of their batteries intact to the NVA. Hambleton commented after the war, [...] "If the taxpayers and my neighbors <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> cost to pull me out of there, they'd probably shoot me." ...|$|E

500|$|Broderick's moves were choreographed by Kenny Ortega (who later choreographed Dirty Dancing). Much {{of it had}} to be {{scrapped}} {{though as}} Broderick had injured his knee badly during the scenes of running through neighbors' backyards. [...] "I was pretty sore", Broderick said. [...] "I got well enough to do {{what you see in the}} parade there, but I couldn't do most of Kenny Ortega's knee spins and things like that that we had worked on. When we did shoot it, we had all this choreography and I remember John would yell with a megaphone, 'Okay, do it again, but don't do any of the choreography,' because he wanted it to be a total mess." [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] was somewhat choreographed but for [...] "Twist and Shout", Broderick said, [...] "we were just making everything up". Hughes explained that much of the scene was spontaneously filmed. [...] "It just happened that this was an actual parade, which we put our float into—unbeknownst to anybody, all the people on the reviewing stand. Nobody <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was, including the governor." ...|$|E
500|$|Clair {{has since}} been {{established}} as a feminist icon. Vox's Lauren Williams credits the character with teaching [...] "me about feminism before I <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was". Writing for Jezebel, Hilary Crosley Coker crowned Clair [...] "a Trojan Horse for" [...] both feminism and black feminism. Dubbing the character [...] "a bonafide feminist warrior", Daily Life Ruby Hamad praised Clair for teaching her [...] "that a woman is no less of a woman, {{a mother and a}} wife for working." [...] Slate critic Jason Bailey observed that, during The Cosby Shows initial run, critics and audiences were too busy commenting on the race of the sitcom's main characters to notice that Cosby had imbued his series with [...] "proud and vocal feminism" [...] in the form of Clair. According to Bailey, The Cosby Show was not only successful because Clair [...] "was a strong, liberated woman with a career"; she also [...] "had a husband and family who supported and valued her endeavors." [...] Dubbing Clair's influence on pop culture as [...] "one of TV’s great feminists" [...] the [...] "Other Huxtable Effect", Bailey concluded that the character's impact remains indisputable despite Cosby's recent sexual assault allegations, and thus maintains that The Cosby Shows legacy as a feminist series should not be discredited.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chesney later {{suggested}} {{the failure of}} his marriage was due to [...] "panic" [...] from the intense media scrutiny surrounding it.

According to Cynthia Ozick, [...] "Though {{he was at}} home in Yiddish and Hebrew, and was familiar with the traditional texts and their demanding commentaries, he added to these a lifelong fascination with Maupassant and Flaubert. His first stories were composed in fluent literary French. The breadth and scope of his social compass enabled him to see through the eyes of peasants, soldiers, priests, rabbis, children, artists, actors, women of all classes.

2500|$|Beatty cast Keaton {{after seeing}} her in Annie Hall, {{as he wanted}} to bring her natural {{nervousness}} and insecure attitude to the role. The production of Reds was delayed several times following its conception in 1977, and Keaton almost left the project when she believed {{it would never be}} produced. Filming finally began two years later. In a 2006 Vanity Fair story, Keaton described her role as [...] "the everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was probably more ordinary ...

Snape later finds the map in Harry's possession and tries to force it to reveal its secrets, but the map merely mocks and insults him. Lupin (one of the creators of the map), the current Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, is called upon to investigate this [...] "dark object", and confiscates it to keep Harry safe, though he returns it to Harry after resigning his post at Hogwarts. From then on, the map becomes one of Harry's most useful tools in his ongoing adventures.|$|E
2500|$|Much to {{the chagrin}} of Warner Bros., Russell decided to use a number of {{experimental}} cinematic techniques in the film. Handheld cameras and Steadicam shots were used to give the film a journalistic feel. Russell shot a majority of the film on Ektachrome transparency stock that was cross processed in colour negative chemicals, to reproduce [...] "the odd colour of the newspaper images [...]" [...] Though the process produced a unique quality and look to the film, it was exceedingly unreliable to develop, and many film labs would not provide insurance for the transparency stock if it did not develop properly. Russell feared that the scenes would need to be reshot until finally a lab was found that would develop the transparency stock in the negative chemicals. The opening was shot on conventional negative stock and bleach bypassed to give a deep black and high contrast look. Some interior shots were also filmed on conventional negative stock and processed normally. Russell also credited the realism of the firefights to the film's cinematographer, Newton Thomas Sigel, who had shot several documentaries on South American civil wars, saying [...] "he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was like to be in that kind of world." ...|$|E
