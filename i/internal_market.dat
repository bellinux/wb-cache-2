5|$|The airline {{was founded}} by {{shipowner}} Ludvig G. Braathen and initially flew to destinations in Asia. The original fleet consisted of Douglas aircraft; these were first used for long-haul flights, but were gradually shifted for use in medium- and short-haul charter services. The airline started domestic services in 1954, with all its scheduled routes flown domestically until 1987. However, it continued to fly charter services from both Norway and Sweden, mostly to the Mediterranean. For Norwegian routes, Braathens first used a fleet of Herons, which were replaced with the Fokker F27 from 1958. The airline became the launch customer of the Fokker F28 in 1969 and also took delivery of Boeing 737-200 aircraft. The jet aircraft were at first used for charter, but later also for domestic services. All later deliveries would consist of Boeing aircraft, and after 1977 Braathens operated only jets. Between 1986 and 1989 the airline operated only the 737-200. By 1994, {{they had all been}} replaced with 737-400 and -500. Braathens entered the Swedish <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> in 1997 by purchasing Transwede and Malmö Aviation. This gave the airline a wider range of aircraft, including the 737-700, Fokker 100 and BAe 146. The losses suffered under a price war with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Color Air in 1998 and 1999 caused the airline to be taken over by the SAS Group in 2001. Braathens and SAS Norway merged to form SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E

It is reasonable to expect that the concept has a clear meaning and a related body of empirical findings. However, marketing scholars have not agreed upon a single, common definition of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing.</b> The extant literature on <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> contains a variety of interpretations in relation to the domain of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing,</b> its aims and its focus. Therefore, much of the knowledge available is mainly derived from normative work as the proportion of empirical studies remains limited. <b>Internal</b> <b>marketing</b> practice remains limited, probably {{because of the lack of}} a proper underlying philosophy as well as the mixed evidence relating to implementation. This study proposes a conceptual framework which seeks to define the domain of the <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> concept, together with its’ antecedents and consequences. The subject of <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> is investigated within the context of tourism as a unique service industry in which there is a high level; of contact between customers and employees and where internal programmes aimed at employees have value to complement external programmes targeted at customers. A qualitative case study of one of the leading travel firms in UK from an employment perspective is used to shed light on the unique culture that underlies <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> practices, how <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> is practiced in reality, the way in which it affects both internal and external aspects of the organisation The findings highlight the importance of organisational culture and the manner in which culture underpins effective <b>internal</b> <b>marketing</b> within a business context. <b>Internal</b> <b>marketing</b> practices are shown to be vital in building and sustaining a people- and service-orientated culture throughout the organisation.

Influence activities that arise from decentralization, imperfect monitoring, and a relative performance system are a potential liability of <b>internal</b> <b>markets,</b> coordination may be worse in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> than in external markets. However, strategic coordination is an advantage of <b>internal</b> <b>markets,</b> a hierarchy can more effectively implement strategic policies in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> than external markets. The {{results of this study}} show that profit center managers engage in influence activities by haggling over price adjustments, causing greater renegotiation costs in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> than in comparable external markets. However, implementation of cost reduction, which is a strategic policy, appears to be more effective in <b>internal</b> <b>markets</b> the results show that supplying profit centers disclose more private cost information than external market suppliers.

40|$|The {{birth of}} <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> {{has its roots}} in the 1980 ’s and its purpose was to provide {{continuous}} and consistent satisfying service quality. The term <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> has been derived from the word ‘internal customers’ which was first used by Berry (1981). <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> deals with considering employees as internal customers and continuously selling their job to them to encourage better performance and better customer satisfaction. This thesis examines the depth of understanding and the applicability of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> in the higher education sector which is not a conventional service industry. It also focuses on the relationship between perceptions of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> and Organizational Commitment of the employees in the higher education sector. Many researchers use the definitions of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> which focus too exclusively on service firms. Although there has been a continued blurring of lines between service and manufacturing firms in recent years, with more manufacturing firms talking about how good their ‘service’ has become, there are differences between service firms and others (Cahill, 1995). It is important to consider other organizations, like education, as providing services as well. While considering Education as a service provider, the marketer’s focus has been mainly on the external customers who in the case of higher education are the students. Considering and studying <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> in the higher education context is one of the main purposes of this research. The results of this study will help the Internal Marketers to understand and develop this concept which can cater for the universities. The results will also help the management staff of the universities in the context of raising awareness in <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing.</b> Secondly, the perceptions of Internal Marketers are as important as the perceptions of the receivers of the <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing.</b> This study uses a cross-sectional design of perceptions of both the appliers and the receivers of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing.</b> Collecting data from two different groups of respondents gives a comprehensive understanding of the concept of <b>Internal</b> <b>Marketing</b> in a different context as mentioned in the literature review.

Results: The results showed that two dimensions positively and significantly influence the employee engagement, namely “empathy and attention in leadership” and “work quality and awards”.
