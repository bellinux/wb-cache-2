He and the other officials kept their eyes on us after that and we had little chance of getting away with any more larks like that.|$|E
25|$|Duke's student newspaper, The Chronicle, {{depicted}} {{other examples}} of violence and dishonesty from Sgt. Gottlieb. It published that one student threw a party at his rental home off-East Campus before the Rolling Stones concert in October 2005. The morning after the concert, at 3 A.M., Sgt. Gottlieb led a raid on the home with nine other officers while the students were <b>half</b> <b>asleep.</b> It reported that one student was dragged {{out of bed and}} then dragged down the stairs. It reported that all seven housemates were put in handcuffs, arrested, and taken into custody for violating a noise ordinance and open container of alcohol violations. Sgt. Gottlieb reportedly told one student, an American citizen of Serbian descent, that the student could be deported. Other stories include the throwing of a 130pound male against his car for an open container of alcohol violation, refusing the ID of a student since he was international, searching through a purse without a warrant, refusing to tell a student her rights, and accusations of perjury.|$|E
500|$|... "Cocoon" [...] {{is a song}} based {{around a}} bassline and beats that [...] "sound like {{fingertips}} on skin". Discussing the glitch sound of the song, Björk said: [...] "when you take technology and use the areas where it breaks, where it's faulty, you're entering a mystery zone where you can't control it." [...] Björk's whispered vocals in [...] "Cocoon" [...] were described as [...] "near-cracking falsetto and a breathy ecstasy". Lyrically, for Michael Cragg from The Guardian newspaper, [...] "it feels almost intrusive, like reading someone's diary as they write about a new love", as Björk had just started the relationship with Barney. Its lyrics are set between metaphor, with her singing [...] "who {{would have known that}} a boy like him would have entered me lightly, restoring my blisses" [...] and over-sharing, whilst also stating [...] "He slides inside, half awake, <b>half</b> <b>asleep...</b> gorgeousness, he's still inside me".|$|E

A minister of the sanctuary comes to remove Pylades.

2500|$|Down-to-earth-aspects in Africanus' {{descriptions}} {{were largely}} ignored and stories of great riches {{served as a}} catalyst for travellers to visit the inaccessible city – with prominent French explorer René Caillié characterising Timbuktu as [...] "a mass of ill-looking houses built of earth". Now opened up, many travellers acknowledged the unfitting description of an [...] "African El Dorado". This development shifted the city's reputation – from being fabled because of its gold to fabled because of its location and mystery: Being used in this sense since at least 1863, English dictionaries now cite Timbuktu as a metaphor for any faraway place. Long part of colloquial language, Timbuktu also found its way into literature: in Tom Robbins' novel <b>Half</b> <b>Asleep</b> in Frog Pajamas, Timbuktu provides a central theme. One lead character, Larry Diamond, is vocally fascinated with the city.|$|E
2500|$|DeVille {{recorded}} Miracle in London with Mark Knopfler {{serving as}} his sideman and producer. He said, [...] "It was Mark (Knopfler’s) wife Lourdes {{who came up}} with the idea (to record Miracle). She said to him that you don't sing like Willy and he doesn't play guitar like you, but you really like his stuff so why don't you do an album together?" [...] "Storybook Love", a song from Miracle and the theme song of the movie The Princess Bride, was nominated for an Academy Award in 1987; DeVille performed the song at that year's Academy Awards telecast.Knopfler heard ("Storybook Love") and asked if I knew about this movie he was doing. It was a Rob Reiner film about a princess and a prince. The song was about the same subject matter as the film, so we submitted it to Reiner and he loved it. About six or seven months later, I was <b>half</b> <b>asleep</b> when the phone rang. It was the Academy of Arts and Sciences with the whole spiel. I hung up on them! They called back and Lisa (his wife) answered the phone. She came in to tell me that I was nominated for [...] "Storybook Love." [...] It's pretty wild. It's not the Grammys — it's the Academy Awards, which is different for a musician. Before I knew it, I was performing on the awards show with Little Richard. It was the year of Dirty Dancing, and they won.|$|E
2500|$|Polgár {{has rarely}} played in women's-specific tournaments or {{divisions}} {{and has never}} competed for the Women's World Championship: [...] "I always say that women should have the self-confidence that they {{are as good as}} male players, but only if they are willing to work and take it seriously as much as male players." [...] While László Polgár has been credited with being an excellent chess coach, the Polgárs had also employed professional chessplayers to train their daughters, including Hungarian champion IM Tibor Florian, GM Pal Benko, and Russian GM Alexander Chernin. Susan Polgár, the eldest of the sisters, 5½ years older than Sophia and 7 years older than Judit, {{was the first of the}} sisters to achieve prominence in chess by winning tournaments, and by 1986, she was the world's top-rated female chess player. Initially, being the youngest, Judit was separated from her sisters while they were in training. However, this only served to increase Judit's curiosity. After learning the rules, they discovered Judit was able to find solutions to the problems they were studying, and she began to be invited into the group. One evening, Susan was studying an endgame with their trainer, a strong International Master. Unable to find the solution, they woke Judit, who was asleep in bed and carried her into the training room. Still <b>half</b> <b>asleep,</b> Judit showed them how to solve the problem, after which they put her back to bed. László Polgár's experiment would produce a family of one international master and two grandmasters and would strengthen the argument for nurture over nature, but also prove women could be grandmasters of chess.|$|E

60|$|Leaving the dormitories, I {{entered the}} great hall, in which were {{gathered}} nearly 600 men seated upon benches, {{every one of}} which was filled. The faces and general aspect of these men were eloquent of want and sorrow. Some of them appeared to be intent upon the religious service that was going on, attendance at this service being the condition on which the free breakfast is given to all who need food and have passed the previous night in the street.

60|$|That night, at ten o'clock, {{when all}} in the hold had been <b>asleep</b> <b>half</b> an hour, Oswald rose quietly from the rushes, on which he and a dozen of his comrades were sleeping, {{and made his way}} noiselessly out of the room; went into the stables and fetched the piece of iron, which he had, during the day, placed so that he could feel it in the dark; took the coil of rope in his hands, and ascended the steps. The top was but some ten feet from the turret. He stood quiet, until he heard the sentry moving away from him, then he mounted the last steps, and in a moment reached the foot of the turret stairs.

60|$|A {{good many}} people were under these great arches; {{some of whom were}} reclining, <b>half</b> or quite <b>asleep,</b> on the marble seats that are built {{against the back of the}} loggia. A group was reading an edict of the Grand Duke, which {{appeared}} to have been just posted on a board, at the farther end of it; and I was surprised at the interest which they ventured to manifest, and the freedom with which they seemed to discuss it. A soldier was on guard, and doubtless there were spies enough to carry every word that was said to the ear of absolute authority. Glancing myself at the edict, however, I found it referred only to the furtherance of a project, got up among the citizens themselves, for bringing water into the city; and on such topics, I suppose there is freedom of discussion.|$|R
60|$|The {{side of the}} quadrangle, {{in which}} she {{supposed}} the guilty scene to be acting, being, according to her belief, just opposite her own, it struck her that, if judiciously watched, some rays {{of light from the}} general's lamp might glimmer through the lower windows, as he passed to the prison of his wife; and, twice before she stepped into bed, she stole gently from her room to the corresponding window in the gallery, to see if it appeared; but all abroad was dark, and it must yet be too early. The various ascending noises convinced her that the servants must still be up. Till midnight, she supposed it would be in vain to watch; but then, when the clock had struck twelve, and all was quiet, she would, if not quite appalled by darkness, steal out and look once more. The clock struck twelve--and Catherine had been <b>half</b> an hour <b>asleep.</b>|$|R
