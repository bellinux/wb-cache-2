DESIGN: In-home interviews followed by retrospective office chart and pharmacy database reviews. SETTING: Two rural communities in southern Alberta with populations of less than 7000 people. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-five patients aged 75 years or older residing in the study communities, eight family physicians, and four dispensing pharmacies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of currently consumed prescription drugs, currently consumed over-the-counter (OTC) drugs, and stored or discontinued prescribed medications; knowledge of medications (prescribed, OTC, and stored) by family physicians and pharmacists; and number of prescribers or <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacists.</b> RESULTS: Patients took a mean of 56 prescribed medications, took a mean of 3. 5 OTC medications, and had a mean of 2. 0 stored or discontinued medications. Attending family physicians and primary <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacists</b> typically knew of only some of their patients' entire regimen of medications. CONCLUSIONS: Misinformation about medication consumption by seniors was common among health care providers. Undertaking routine medication reviews (with emphasis on OTC use), asking specific questions about actual consumption, encouraging use of one prescriber and one pharmacist, discouraging storage of discontinued medications and reducing use of medication samples should be of benefit...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Automatic drug {{dispensing}} systems (ADS) allow patient-specific, unit-dose packaging of medication. They {{claim to}} provide cheaper, {{more efficient and}} safer drug management (1). However, {{little is known about}} health care providers’ (HCPs) expectations or the perceived problems when introducing ADS in a non-hospital environment. Therefore, we studied HCPs views regarding ADS introduction in a Belgian nursing home. Methods: Structured interviews between September and December 2009, before and after the introduction of ADS. Interviewees included <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacist,</b> nurses, nursing home management and coordinating physician. Interviews were audio-recorded, verbatim transcribed and qualitatively analyzed using a framework analysis approach. Results: Nine interviews before, and 8 after ADS introduction were conducted. Information: in the first round, most nurses mentioned a lack of information on ADS, contrary to the pharmacist, coordinating physician and head nurse. This difference was resolved only after introduction of ADS. Time management: most people expected to spend less time in medication management after introduction of ADS, except the pharmacist. After introduction, HCPs reported to need extra time for distribution and administration {{due to the fact that}} not all medication is distributable by ADS, and hence required a combination of old and new system. Also administrative issues required more time. Medication errors: new errors arose, due to non-familiarity with the new IT system, and problems with the number and labeling of pouches. Also unexpected discontinuation of therapy caused problems. On the other hand, all participants felt more secure about medication management. User-friendliness: the new medication pouches were deemed more hygienic and easier for administration than the old distribution system. The pouches, however, were more space-consuming and thus difficult to manage. Conclusion: This analysis shows that health care providers have high expectations on the introduction of ADS, but that new problems can arise that have to be expected and handled appropriately. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Introduction An {{extended}} {{role for}} pharmacists in medicine management, clinical decision-making and patient support is being increasingly recognised. Policy documents encourage {{appropriate use of}} pharmacists' skills and expertise in delivering services and have already introduced enhanced programmes of care. Supplementary prescribing by community pharmacists is the most ambitious of recent initiatives. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate patients' preferences for an innovative prescribing role for pharmacists in the management of drug therapies, compared to the more traditional role. The perceived benefits are an increased convenience for the patient and more efficient use of the healthcare workforce. Methods The project was a cross-sectional pilot study based in two city centre multi partnered General Practice in Aberdeen, Scotland. A self-completed questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of patients aged > 18 years waiting to see their doctor at the surgery. A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was used to elicit patient preferences for extending the role of the pharmacist to include prescribing as well as dispensing. The new service proposed was compared to both the current situation and alternative <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacist</b> scenarios. Attributes included were: time spent travelling to, and waiting in, the GP surgery; time spent travelling to, and waiting in, the pharmacy; chance of receiving the "best" treatment; and cost. A multinomial regression analysis was used to estimate factors that influence patients' preferences, their relative importance, trade-offs between attributes and willingness to pay for alternative ways of managing drug treatment. Results 244 people were approached and 204 returned an evaluable questionnaire. All attributes, except time spent travelling to, and waiting in, the pharmacy, were important in choosing the service. A unit change in the 'best' treatment and 'cost' attributes was the most important. The respondents were willing to pay over £ 10 for a 1...|$|E
40|$|Medications {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} used treatment modalities for disease management worldwide. Research has confirmed a high prevalence of adverse drug events (ADEs) in the Australian community setting. A potential strategy is to integrate pharmacists into the general practice environment to reduce the incidence of ADEs and to improve the quality use of medicines within the primary care setting. The integration of a pharmacist into a general practice medical centre is a novel approach in Australia and evidence supporting this role in the Australian context is currently limited. The overall aim of this thesis was to determine the feasibility of pharmacist integration into an Australian general practice medical centre to provide services which enhance the quality use of medicines in the primary care setting. Three connected phases of research were employed to address the overall aim and included seeking key stakeholder opinion, describing integrated services delivered during a pilot, and comparing the integrated model of practice to that of usual care for a key service. Focus groups and semi-structured interviews were utilised to obtain local opinions from GPs, pharmacists, health care consumers, and practice managers on pharmacist integration into the general practice environment. A total of 58 participants took part and concepts relating to six themes were identified. These included positively viewed roles such as medication reviews and prescribing, negatively viewed roles such as dispensing and diagnosing, barriers to pharmacist integration such as medical culture and remuneration, facilitators to pharmacist integration such as remuneration and training, benefits of integration such as access to the patient’s medical file, and potential funding models. These results informed the development of a national survey which allowed a broader and greater depth of investigation in opinions. Online and paper-based questionnaires were used to survey GPs, health care consumers, and pharmacists. 1038 participants completed the questionnaire. The commonly agreed roles for the pharmacist included drug information and medication review. Perceived barriers to service provision included the pharmacist’s clinical abilities and turf protection. Remuneration was viewed as both a facilitator and a barrier. Perceived facilitators included additional training for the pharmacist and a previously established rapport with the medical staff. The combined results of the interviews and surveys indicate that all participants generally supported the extended role of a pharmacist into the general practice setting. These findings were used guide a pilot intervention where the doctoral candidate was integrated into a general practice medical centre as a non <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacist.</b> To describe the activities carried out by a primary care practice pharmacist on a day to day basis the pharmacist kept a diary over a three month period. During this period 296 hours of activity were documented. Activities the pharmacist performed most frequently included medication review, ‘pharmaceutical opinion’, student supervision, drug information, and administrative tasks. This study demonstrated the broad range of activities which were conducted by a pharmacist in the primary care setting. Quality prescribing activities such as clinical prescribing audits, clinical case studies, and therapeutic education sessions were also identified for the pilot intervention. The integrated pharmacist was tasked to facilitate the aforementioned activities for the medical centre GPs. Nine out of 13 GPs completed an initial clinical prescribing audit on antihypertensive therapy, attended a therapeutic education and audit feedback session delivered by the pharmacist, completed a clinical case study facilitated by the pharmacist, and participated in a follow up prescribing audit. Results from the antihypertensive audit showed a 27 % increase in the number of patients meeting their blood pressure targets. A key activity for the integrated pharmacist as identified from the interviews and surveys outlined above was medication review. Medication reviews conducted by pharmacists practising externally to a medical centre and those medication reviews conducted by the integrated pharmacist were compared across process outcomes such as timeliness and uptake and for content such as the types of drug related problems identified and uptake of pharmacist recommendation by the GPs. The results demonstrate that there was a significantly greater uptake of medication reviews, significantly more medication reviews completed, and the reviews were significantly timelier during the integrated pharmacist period. The integrated pharmacist identified similar drug related problems and made similar recommendations to that of an external pharmacist with some important differences. The proposed cause of these differences was attributed to the practice pharmacist having access to the patient’s medical file. The location where the medication review was conducted had minimal impact on the on the review findings or implementation rate of recommendations. Significantly higher rates of recommendations are implemented by the general practitioners when the pharmacist is integrated into the medical centre. In conclusion, the integration of a non <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacist</b> into an Australian general practice medical centre is a feasible concept. Future work should focus on the impact of integrated pharmacist intervention on patient related health and economic outcomes...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: India {{has more}} than 20, 000 {{registered}} pharmaceutical manufacturers. Consequently, there is a flood of brand names to choose from. We conducted this study to analyse and sort out the multitudinous brand names thronging the Indian market, and identified those that could create a possible confusion.

Some other brand names that are available with the pharmacists but {{are not included in}} these indexes were also included in the study for analysis. OBSERVATIONS: Potentially confusing brand names were sorted out and categorised according to the severity of damage they can cause if misinterpreted by the pharmacist or the patient.

The findings provide a starting point for a cross profession debate to re-establish the original intention of the MUR of providing consultation with patients to identify and correct poor adherence to the correct use of medicines by using the pharmacists’ professional knowledge to the full. For employers the findings show clearly that the way pharmacists are managed is in many cases unproductive as the financial gains from extra MUR income are being consumed through the extra organisational costs that arise from unsupportive management and bullying tactics that lower pharmacists’ commitment, increase their stress and intentions to quit...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 9928 {{patients}} taking cimetidine and 9351 controls were recruited to a postmarketing drug surveillance study in Glasgow, Nottingham, Oxford, and Portsmouth.

So far as can be assessed, however, none of these drug-disease associations represented adverse effects of cimetidine treatment; on the contrary, they resulted from cimetidine being used, knowingly or unknowingly, for treating the symptoms of various diseases or for alleviating adverse effects of other agents such as corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and radiotherapy.

40|$|Background: Granting <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacists</b> the {{authority}} to prescribe has significant implications for pharmaceutical and health human resources policy, and quality of care. Despite {{the growing number of}} jurisdictions that have given pharmacists such privileges, there are few rigorous evaluations of these policy changes. This study will examine a January 2009 policy change in British Columbia (BC), Canada that allowed pharmacists to independently adapt and renew prescriptions. We hypothesize this policy increased drug utilization and drug costs, increased patient adherence to medication, and reduced total healthcare resource use. Methods/Design: We will study a population-based cohort of approximately 4 million BC residents from 2004 through 2010. We will use data from BC PharmaNet on all of the prescriptions obtained by this cohort during the study period, and link it to administrative billings from physicians and hospital discharges. Using interrupted time series analysis, we will study longitudinal changes in drug utilization and costs, medication adherence, and shortterm health care use. Further, using hierarchical modelling, we will examine the factors at the regional, pharmacy, patient, and prescription levels that are associated with prescription adaptations and renewals. Discussion: In a recent survey of Canadian policymakers, many respondents ranked the issue of prescribing privileges as one of their most pressing policy questions. No matter the results of our study, they will be important for policymakers, as our data will make policy decisions surrounding pharmacist prescribing more evidence-based...|$|R

We report the re-analyzed results of 1687 cases in clinical settings obtained through postmarketing surveillance in Japan. Method: Study subjects were patients receiving treatment for the first time with amlodipine ODT for hypertension under routine care. A multicenter central registration system was used for this prospective survey. The survey was conducted fromOctober 2008 to October 2010. The observational period was 12 weeks, during which time surveys on outpatient blood pressure, ad-verse events, palatability, etc. were conducted. Results: Blood pressure stabilized following treatment, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were favorably controlled. Adverse events observed were not significantly different from those observed during drug use trials of amlodipine formulations reported in 2003. Moreover, palatability of amlo-dipine ODT showed a 99. 6 % (227 of 228 cases) favorable patient acceptance, which is consistent with the initial design concept of RACTAB formulation. Conclusions: The results of this postmarketing surveillance study indicated that the efficacy, safety, and palatability of amlodipine ODT met our ex-pectations (dissolves quickly in the mouth, tastes good, and is not rough on the tongue). Accordingly, amlodipine ODT are believed to be an easy-to-use formulation for prescribing doctors, <b>dispensing</b> <b>pharmacists,</b> and patients receiving treatment...|$|R
