25|$|Water {{and steam}} based central heating systems have {{traditionally}} had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central {{system would be}} switched on when the temperature drops below the set point on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual <b>electric</b> <b>convection</b> <b>heaters,</b> where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the set point desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>convection</b> <b>heater</b> or {{convector}} {{refers to}} a class of devices in which the source of heat is not directly exposed. As domestic safety and the supply from water heaters keeps temperatures relatively low, radiation is inefficient in comparison to <b>convection.</b> <b>Convection</b> <b>heaters</b> also work differently to electric radiators in that they disperse heat differently.|$|R

The numerical simulation was used. Hydrodynamic equations solving taken with initial and boundary conditions allowed us to obtain information about temperature distribution and air speed in the studied volume. The solution was performed for the nonstationary problem. The study results provide an estimation of temporal patterns of temperature changes and air speed in different zones of heated room with radiators and <b>convection</b> <b>heaters</b> in use.

50|$|A <b>convection</b> <b>heater</b> is {{a heater}} which {{operates}} by air convection currents circulating {{through the body}} of the appliance, and across its heating element. This heats up the air, causing it to increase in volume and so become buoyant and rise. Oil heaters are an example of this kind of heating appliance. A <b>convection</b> <b>heater</b> may have an electrical heater element, a hot water coil, or a steam coil. Because of the natural ventilation, they are quieter in operation than fan heaters.|$|R

The transparent electrically conductive layer 2 is sandwiched between layer 1 and another transparent layer 1 a. The passage of an electrical current through the optically transparent conductive layer 2 causes it to be heated according to the Joule effect, thereby heating the transparent panels 1 and 1 a and the surrounding air by convection...|$|R

50|$|In <b>convection</b> <b>heaters,</b> heating {{elements}} either warm the air directly or heat oil or another filler, {{which in turn}} transfers heat to the air. The air then warms the objects {{and people in the}} space. Convective heaters are suitable for providing constant, diffuse heat in well-insulated rooms. Oil heaters warm up slowly but do not reach dangerous surface temperatures; wire-element heaters, which may be fan assisted, produce warm air more quickly but may pose a fire hazard. One particular type of convective heater is the fan heater.|$|R

25|$|In a <b>convection</b> <b>heater,</b> {{the heating}} element heats {{the air in}} contact with it by thermal conduction. Hot air is less dense than cool air, so it rises due to buoyancy, {{allowing}} more cool air to flow in to take its place. This sets up a convection current of hot air that rises from the heater, heats up the surrounding space, cools and then repeats the cycle. These heaters are sometimes filled with oil. They are ideally suited for heating a closed space. They operate silently and have a lower risk of ignition hazard if they make unintended contact with furnishings compared to radiant electric heaters.|$|R

Not only does the voltage created by the pilot thermocouple activate the pilot gas valve, it is also routed through a thermostat to power the main gas valve as well. Here, a larger voltage is needed than in a pilot flame safety system described above, and a thermopile is used rather than a single thermocouple. Such a system requires no external source of electricity for its operation and thus can operate during a power failure, provided that all the other related system components allow for this. This excludes common forced air furnaces because external electrical power is required to operate the blower motor, but this feature is especially useful for un-powered <b>convection</b> <b>heaters.</b> A similar gas shut-off safety mechanism using a thermocouple is sometimes employed {{to ensure that the}} main burner ignites within a certain time period, shutting off the main burner gas supply valve should that not happen.|$|R

A 2 -dimensional mathematical model of the gage-plate system has been developed to simulate the combined problem involving convection, radiation and mass loss by chemical reaction.

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>electric</b> <b>convection</b> field results from the {{interaction}} between the solar wind plasma and the geomagnetic field. In the polar regions with open magnetic field lines (where the geomagnetic field merges with the interplanetary magnetic field), the solar wind flowing through the polar magnetosphere induces an electric field directed from dawn to dusk. Charge separation takes place at the magnetopause. This area is connected via the last closed shell parameter Lm with the ionospheric dynamo region. Thus, discharging currents flow via electric field-aligned currents (Birkeland currents) along Lm [...] within the ionospheric dynamo region. The field-aligned currents flow into the ionosphere on the morning side and out of the ionosphere on the evening side. The variability of the solar wind flux determines the magnetospheric activity, generally expressed by the degree of geomagnetic activity observed on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>convection</b> {{field in}} the near Earth polar region can be {{simulated}} by eq. (...) with the exponent q = - 1/2. At the separatrix at Lm ,Φc is continuous. However, a field reversal takes place accompanied by field-aligned currents, both {{in agreement with the}} observations.The electric field reversal at Lm clearly indicates a reversal of the plasma drift within the inner and the polar magnetosphere. In a more sophisticated model, the auroral oval between about 15° and 20°colatitude (again simulated by a coaxial auroral zone), as a transition zone between the field reversal, has been taken into account. The ionospheric dynamo region between about 100 to 200 km altitude is a region where ions and electrons have different mobility. Thus the plasma becomes electrically conducting. Due to the geomagnetic field, two kinds of electric currents exist: Pedersen currents parallel to E, and Hall currents orthogonal to E and B. Moreover, a significant enhancement of the electric conductivity within the aurora area depending on geomagnetic activity exists which influences the parameter τco [...] in eq. (...) [...] The <b>electric</b> <b>convection</b> field drives strong electric currents within the polar dynamo regions (e.g. DP1 and DP2) which can be simulated by the model. Manifestations of upper atmospheric electric currents are the corresponding magnetic variations on the ground. Unfortunately, this connection is unique only for horizontally flowing current systems. E.g., the vertically flowing field-aligned currents have almost no magnetic effect on the ground. The model allows to separate the contributions of both kinds of electric currents. The polar magnetic disturbances DP2 are mainly Hall currents. The auroral electrojets (DP1) with magnitudes of the order of several hundreds of kA flowing within the aurora zones consist of Hall currents and Pedersen currents. Dissipation of the Pedersen currents produces Joule heating which is transferred to the neutral gas of the thermosphere thus generating thermospheric and ionospheric disturbances. Longer-lasting magnetospheric disturbances of the order of several hours to days can develop into global-scale thermospheric and ionospheric storms (e.g.,).|$|R
