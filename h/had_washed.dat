5|$|The Pond Eddy Bridge is a petit {{truss bridge}} {{spanning}} the Delaware River between the hamlet of Pond Eddy in Lumberland, New York and the settlement informally called Pond Eddy in Shohola Township, Pennsylvania. It is accessible from NY 97 in Lumberland on the New York side and two dead-end local roads, Flagstone Road (State Route 1011) and Rosa Road on the Pennsylvania side. The bridge {{was built in}} 1903 by the Oswego Bridge Company to replace an old suspension bridge that <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> away in a flood earlier in the year. It connected the bluestone quarries in Pennsylvania to New York.|$|E

25|$|With {{the cave}} {{thoroughly}} searched, some divers began questioning whether Ben {{was there at}} all. Perhaps his body had been secretly removed from the cave before searching began and disposed of on land or it <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> out through the spring's outlet. Others, including Cronin and Kelly, suggested he had staged his own disappearance to start his life over under another identity and escape his past troubles. Authorities began to consider these possibilities and adjust their search.|$|E
25|$|By 19 June, rain <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> {{away the}} main road at Hampton Loade and the Severn Valley Railway line from Bridgnorth was closed after {{numerous}} landslips on the line. Also, on 19 June/20 June, parts {{of the town of}} Shifnal near Telford, were flooded when the Wesley Brook burst its banks. Some of the residents blame Severn Trent Water for opening floodgates at Priors Lee balancing lake, however no such gates exist. Repair costs to the railway were estimated at £2million.|$|E
25|$|The {{most likely}} {{reason for the}} {{overheating}} of the port engine was the plate heat exchanger getting clogged by small pieces of coal that <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> overboard from the cargo hold and entered the cooling system via the port side sea chest. The starboard engine was not affected because it used a separate sea water intake {{in the bottom of}} the vessel. Another possible cause was the development of hairline cracks in the cylinder liner or head due to large variations in engine load, allowing hot exhaust gases to mix with the cooling water.|$|E

25|$|Harmon {{applied to}} enlist as a cadet in the United States Army Air Corps in early November 1941. He was granted {{permission}} to enlist as a cadet in March 1942. Despite rumors that he <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> out of flight school, Harmon underwent his first 60 {{hours of flight}} training at the now defunct Oxnard Air Force Base in Camarillo, California, and then finished basic flying school at Gardner Army Airfield in Taft, California, in September 1942. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and a twin-engine bomber pilot and assigned to Williams Field in Arizona in October 1942.|$|E
25|$|During April 1881, {{under the}} command of John William Nicholson, the Advance got away from a near miss when leaving the Grey River at Greymouth under tow of the steam tug Dispatch. The tow ropes were lost and the vessel drifted into the breakwater, moving too fast for the anchor to have held her. The sails were raised, but the wind had died away, and the crew lost control of the vessel. The Dispatch, however, managed to take the Advance in tow once again and left her on the flat {{opposite}} the town. Three feet of water <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> aboard, but no major damage was sustained.|$|E
25|$|In 1965, Togawa {{spoke with}} a local hunter {{who claimed to have}} killed a large cat with fur like a tiger's. He {{disposed}} of the body, and Haemi on {{the southern part of the}} island, where the body was disposed of, was searched. The hunter said that, until ten days prior to the interview, the cat's skeleton was still where he had left it, but the recent rains <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> it away. He described that cat as having a shoulder height that reached an adult human's knee, a tail that was 60 centimeters long, a body twice as large as a house cat's, and greenish striped fur.|$|E

25|$|During {{the same}} time, Bank Rock Bridge, also called Cabinet Bridge, across {{the mouth of}} the cove was recreated in carved oak with {{cast-iron}} panels and pine decking, its original materials, following Vaux's original design of 1859–60. The cascade, where the Gill empties into the lake, was reconstructed to approximate its dramatic original form, inspired by paintings of Asher B. Durand. Sections of the Lake were dredged of accumulated silt – topsoil that <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> off the surrounding slopes – and the island formerly in the lake, which gradually eroded below water level, was reconstructed in the summer of 2007 with rugged boulders along its shoreline, graded wetland areas, and submerged planting shelves for water-loving native plants, like Pickerel weed.|$|E

Another has him throwing the purses {{over a period}} of three years, each time the night before one of the daughters comes of age. Invariably, the third time the father lies in wait, trying to discover the identity of their benefactor. In one version the father confronts the saint, only to have Nicholas say it is not him he should thank, but God alone. In another version, Nicholas learns of the poor man's plan and drops the third bag down the chimney instead; a variant holds that the daughter <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> her stockings that evening and hung them over the embers to dry, and that the bag of gold fell into the stocking.|$|E
25|$|On September 20, 2011, police {{released}} composite {{sketches of}} two of the unidentified victims whose remains were found in March and April 2011 (an Asian male and Jane Doe No. 6), as well as photos of jewelry found on the remains of a female toddler and her mother, found on April 4 and 11, 2011, respectively. The toddler's mother was also revealed as one of the sets of remains found in Nassau County on April 11. Also on September 20, police revealed that the second set of remains found in Nassau County on April 11, 2011, matched two legs that were found in a garbage bag that <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> up on Fire Island in 1996. , the police had received over 1,200 tips via text, email and phone {{since the beginning of the}} investigation.|$|E

25|$|In the Spring of 1855, as the Crimean war developed, Darwin was {{pondering the}} war of nature, taking the then current analogy with an {{industrial}} economy further than others, and wondering how species spread. He was dismissive of the ideas that others had put forward of sunken continents like Atlantis, and began experimenting in his house with soaking seeds in brine then seeing if they could germinate. He reported his results in Gardeners' Chronicle and roped in his curate friends including Henslow. The consul in Norway sent seed pods which <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> ashore. Hooker was able to identify them as coming from the Caribbean {{and get them to}} germinate at Kew. Investigation of variation brought him back to animal husbandry. He now began dissecting domestic animals and breeding pigeons, joining a pigeon fancier's club: very unorthodox behaviour for naturalists at that time.|$|E
25|$|On 17 November 2002, the {{oil tanker}} Prestige split {{in half and}} sank in the Atlantic Ocean, after having had a huge leak in its tanks. A few days later, Man woke up to find his life ruined by an oil spill. Tons of oil <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> {{up on the beach}} where he lived. Most of his sculptures were irremediably {{destroyed}} and the oil even reached his house. Man was absolutely devastated, his whole life work destroyed before his eyes, and the natural environment where he lived heavily polluted for years to come. A month later, he was found dead in his hut. He had circulatory and respiratory problems, but most local people believe that he died of melancholy and sadness {{at the sight of the}} complete and utter destruction of his life by the oil spill. The Camelle authorities organized and paid for his funeral, and hundreds of locals attended.|$|E
25|$|Buckland {{began his}} {{investigation}} {{believing that the}} fossils in the cave were diluvial, that is {{that they had been}} deposited there by a deluge that <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> them from far away, possibly the Biblical flood. However, upon further investigation he realized that the cave had never been open to the surface through its roof, and that the only entrance that had ever been open to the outside world was too small for the carcasses of animals as large as elephants or hippos to have floated in. He began to suspect that the animals had lived in the local area, and that the hyenas had used the cave as a den and brought in remains of the various animals they fed on. This hypothesis was supported by {{the fact that many of}} the bones showed signs of having been gnawed prior to fossilization, and by the presence of objects Buckland suspected to be fossilized hyena dung. Further analysis, including comparison with the dung of modern spotted hyenas living in menageries, confirmed the identification of the fossilized dung.|$|E

25|$|Harris {{revealed}} {{the existence of}} the group to the police, and told them of a homicide that did not make the papers; it was that of a homeless man whom they had kidnapped from Ghirardelli Square. They had brought the man to Black Self-Help Moving's warehouse, gagged and tied him up, and while he was still conscious, took turns hacking away his limbs. Harris told the detectives that they had dumped the body into the bay. He told his story in such detail that the police were convinced of its veracity, especially since the police had, on the previous December 24, recovered the bound and badly butchered torso of a male, missing its hands, feet and head, that <b>had</b> <b>washed</b> up in the city's Ocean Beach district at the foot of Pacheco Street. Harris provided the police with names, dates, addresses and details — enough information to issue arrest warrants against the suspects. Harris subsequently sought, and received, immunity for his help in breaking the Zebra case, as well as new identities for himself, his girlfriend, and her child.|$|E
