25|$|Power {{handling}} {{is related}} to the heat resistance of the wire insulation, adhesive, and bobbin material, and may be influenced by the coil's position within the magnetic gap. The majority of loudspeakers use 'overhung' voice coils, with windings that are taller than the height of the magnetic gap. In this topology, a portion of the coil remains within the gap at all times. The power handling is limited by the amount of heat that can be tolerated, and the amount that can be removed from the voice coil. Some magnet designs include aluminium <b>heat-sink</b> rings above and below the magnet gap, to improve conduction cooling, significantly improving power handling. If all other conditions remain constant, the area of the voice coil windings is proportional to the power handling of the coil. Thus a 100mm diameter voice coil, with a 12mm winding height has similar power handling to a 50mm diameter voice coil with a 24mm winding height.|$|E

Fluorescent lamps intended for higher output will have structural features such as a deformed tube or internal heat-sinks to control cold spot temperature and mercury distribution.

50|$|Surface-mount {{technology}} (SMT) is {{a method}} for producing electronic circuits in which the components are mounted or placed directly {{onto the surface of}} printed circuit boards (PCBs).

50|$|In {{the modern}} {{thermopile}} pyranometers the active (hot) junctions of the thermopile are located beneath the black coating surface and are heated by the radiation absorbed {{from the black}} coating. The passive (cold) junctions of the thermopile are fully protected from solar radiation and in thermal contact with the pyranometer housing, {{which serves as a}} <b>heat-sink.</b> This prevents any alteration from yellowing or decay when measuring the temperature in the shade, thus impairing the measure of the solar irradiance.|$|E
50|$|The current {{focus in}} R&D is on cost reduction, {{increase}} of power density, increase of reliability and reduction of parasitic lumped elements. These parasitics are unwanted capacitances between circuit parts and inductances of circuit traces. Both can have {{negative effects on}} the electromagnetic radiation (EMR) of the module if it is operated as an inverter, for instance. Another problem connected to parasitics is their {{negative impact on the}} switching behavior and the switching loss of the power semiconductors. Therefore, manufacturers work on minimizing the parasitic elements of their modules while keeping cost low and maintain a high degree of interchangeability of their modules with those of a second source (other manufacturer).A further aspect for optimization is the so-called thermal path between the heat source (the dies) and the <b>heat-sink.</b> The heat has to pass through different physical layers as solder, DCB, baseplate, thermal interface material (TIM) and the bulk of the <b>heat-sink,</b> until it is transferred to a gaseous medium as air or a fluid medium as water or oil. Since modern silicon-carbide power semiconductors show a larger power density, the requirements for heat transfer are rising.|$|E
50|$|As can be {{seen from}} the {{derating}} curve image for a hypothetical bipolar junction transistor, the device (rated for 100 W at 25 C) cannot be expected to dissipate anything more than about 40 W if the ambient temperature is such that the temperature at which the device's case will stabilise (after heat-sinking) is 65 C. This final case temperature is a function of the thermal resistance between the device's case and the heat-sink; and the <b>heat-sink</b> and the ambient (this includes the heat-sink's temp/watt rating - with lower values implying better cooling characteristics).|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{thermometers}} {{are less}} sensitive to self-heating due to rf noise than are traditional resistive thermometers. This makes them appealing at temperatures well below 0. 1 Kelvin {{in the operating}} range of many space-flight detectors. We have built and tested a magnetic thermometer which is deposited directly onto a substrate. This device, which uses the temperature dependence of iron-doped palladium s magnetic susceptibility, includes self-shielding deposited coils surrounding a sputtered palladium layer. It is read out using a SQUID to achieve high resolution. Its small size and very good <b>heat-sinking</b> should eventually make it useful for the temperature control of space flight detector arrays, in particular those already using SQUID readouts. The design and test results for this device are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The authors analyse the {{performance}} and device physics of nitride laser diodes that exhibit the highest room-temperature continuous-wave output power. The analysis is based on advanced laser simulation. The laser model self-consistently combines band structure and free-carrier gain calculations with two-dimensional simulations of wave guiding, carrier transport and heat flux. Material parameters used in the model are carefully evaluated. Excellent agreement between simulations and measurements is achieved. The maximum output power is limited by electron leakage into the p-doped ridge. Leakage escalation is caused by strong self-heating, gain reduction and elevated carrier density within the quantum wells. Built-in polarisation fields {{are found to be}} effectively screened at high-power operation. Improved <b>heat-sinking</b> is predicted to allow for a significant increase of the maximum output power. ...|$|R

Thus the DAO allows for a pedagogical introduction to the science of El Nino and La Nina {{while at the same time}} avoiding the need for large-scale computing resources normally associated with much more sophisticated coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. It is an approach which is ideally suited for student projects both at high school and undergraduate level.
