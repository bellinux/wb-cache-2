5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each individual animal is distinctly male or female. The breeding season starts in late November and continues until early March. After internal fertilization the female produces and spawns a long, gelatinous tubular structure containing multiple eggs. This structure then coils itself and compacts, forming a creamy-white <b>egg</b> <b>mass.</b> Each <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> may contain 50,000–70,000 eggs; the females usually lay them on seagrass, where they remain attached. In about 110–130 hours the embryo of L.canarium grows from a single cell to a veliger (a larval form common to marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) and then hatches. The hatching process takes 12–15 hours. After hatching, the larvae can be assigned to four distinct developmental stages throughout their short planktonic life (based on morphological features and other characteristics). Usually, larvae up to 3 days old are Stage I veligers; 4–8-day-old larvae are Stage II; 9–16-day-old larvae are Stage III, and larvae from 17 days to metamorphosis are Stage IV. L.canarium larvae develop faster compared to other species in the same family, including the West Indian fighting conch (Strombus pugilis) and the milk conch (Lobatus costatus). Larval development may be highly influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and the quality and availability of food. Metamorphosis in L.canarium can be recognised by loss of the larval velar lobes {{and the development of}} the typical leaping motion of juvenile true conches.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm {{on top of}} a gelatinous cone, on the substrate either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, Hynobiidae and Cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the <b>egg</b> <b>mass.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{shape and}} size of the <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> is {{characteristic}} of the species. Ranids tend to produce globular clusters containing large numbers of eggs whereas bufonids produce long, cylindrical strings. The tiny yellow-striped pygmy eleuth (Eleutherodactylus limbatus) lays eggs singly, burying them in moist soil. The smoky jungle frog (Leptodactylus pentadactylus) makes a nest of foam in a hollow. The eggs hatch when the nest is flooded, or the tadpoles may complete their development in the foam if flooding does not occur. The red-eyed treefrog (Agalychnis callidryas) deposits its eggs on a leaf above a pool and when they hatch, the larvae fall into the water below. The larvae developing in the eggs can detect vibrations caused by nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten. In general, the length of the egg stage depends on the species and the environmental conditions. Aquatic eggs normally hatch within one week when the capsule splits as a result of enzymes released by the developing larvae.|$|E
40|$|It is {{necessary}} to distinguish new and old gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> when conducting gypsy moth population surveys. <b>Egg</b> <b>masses</b> within reach from the ground are touched {{to determine if they}} contain unhatched eggs and thus are considered new. The following 2 methods are used for <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> not within reach: (1) visual discrimination between new and old <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> or (2) by calculating the percentage of new <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> at ground level and using this value to adjust counts of all <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> not within reach. To evaluate these methods, egg-mass persistence and color between generations, the percentage of new and old <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> at ground level and in the canopy, the ability of observers to visually distinguish new and old <b>egg</b> <b>masses,</b> and the effect of errors on the accuracy of estimates of the percentage of new <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> was examined.

50|$|In China and Korea, <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> {{are placed}} {{high up on}} the under-surfaces of {{branches}} of large pine trees. In Russia and Mongolia, eggs are laid on rock outcrops or on the soil under boulders. <b>Egg</b> <b>masses</b> are laid on top of other <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> or the remains of previous years' <b>egg</b> <b>masses.</b> In far eastern Russia, <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> are laid on undersides of leaves of deciduous trees. When the leaves fall, the eggs are covered with snow and become insulated from temperatures which would otherwise kill them.|$|R
40|$|Many marine {{invertebrates}} deposit benthic <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> that are potentially vulnerable to microbial infection. To help counter this threat these species may have evolved {{some form of}} chemical protection for their encapsulated embryos. In this study the <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> from 7 marine mollusks were tested for antibacterial activity against 4 marine pathogens: Enterococcus sericolicida, Vibrio anguillarum, Vibrio alginolyticus, and Vibrio harveyi. Extracts from all of these <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> were found to inhibit the growth of at least 1 marine bacterium at concentrations that approximate the natural concentration of extract in the <b>egg</b> <b>masses.</b> The <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> of 39 mollusks and 4 polychaetes were then tested for antibacterial activity against 3 human pathogenic bacteria; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Activity was detected in the <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> from 34 species, including 2 polychaetes and mollusks from two classes and 18 families. Antibacterial activity in molluskan <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> was found to extend across the marine, estuarine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. Both gelatinous <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> and tough <b>egg</b> capsules were found to inhibit microbial growth, suggesting that physical protection alone may {{not be sufficient to}} protect the eggs. Antimicrobial activity was observed in the fresh <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> but not in the well-developed <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> of a subset of species. The results {{of this study indicate that}} a wide range of invertebrates use chemical defense to protect their early stage embryos against bacterial infection...|$|R
5|$|Some frogs {{protect their}} {{offspring}} inside their own bodies. Both {{male and female}} pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the <b>egg</b> <b>mass.</b> The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.|$|E
25|$|Preceded by {{induced changes}} in eggshell permeability, {{hatching}} may involve physical and/or enzymatic processes in plant-parasitic nematodes. Cyst nematodes, such as Globodera rostochiensis, {{may require a}} specific signal from the root exudates of the host to trigger hatching. Root-knot nematodes are generally unaffected {{by the presence of}} a host, but hatch freely at the appropriate temperature when water is available. However, in an <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> or cyst, not all eggs will hatch when the conditions are optimal for their particular species, leaving some eggs to hatch at a later date. Ammonium ions have been shown to inhibit hatching and to reduce the plant-penetration ability of M. incognita juveniles that do hatch.|$|E
25|$|The <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> (roe) {{is usually}} green, {{but may also}} have yellow, red, or brown coloration. Pigment {{components}} present in the eggs include bilin and carotenoids such as idoxanthin, crustaxanthin, and vitamin A2 aldehyde (3-dehydroretinal). The bilin and retinal produces the base green color, {{and the amount of}} relative idoxanthin content is the key determinant of the color variation. Study of its prey (such as the amphipods) or the fish's stomach contents reveal negligible traces of idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, which means the fish must be internally converting other carotenoid substances such as astaxanthin that are abundant in their food into idoxanthin and crustaxanthin, given that fish in general cannot build their own carotenoid wholly out of building block materials. Researchers hypothesize that the intake of astaxanthin influences the idoxanthin concentration in the body, which result in the egg color change.|$|E
40|$|Benthic <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> laid in {{intertidal}} habitats {{are exposed}} to numerous environmental stresses including potentially damaging ultraviolet radiation (UVR). We sought to determine the developmental effects of UVR and visible light on molluscan embryos within <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> from habitats with differential UVR exposure. Capsular and gelatinous <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> from 23 marine gastropod species were collected from 3 intertidal habitats: (1) full sun, (2) partial shade, and (3) full shade. <b>Egg</b> <b>masses</b> were then divided among 4 spectral treatments: full spectrum, no UV-B, no UV, and dark. An ANOVA confirmed that a significant interaction between original habitat and spectral treatment affected mortality. <b>Egg</b> <b>masses</b> from full shade habitats showed significant vulnerability to UVR and visible light and had a higher overall mortality than other <b>egg</b> <b>masses.</b> <b>Egg</b> <b>masses</b> that were originally partially shaded did not show any significant mortality differences among spectral treatments, but highest mortalities occurred in full spectrum treatments while lowest mortalities occurred in dark treatments. <b>Egg</b> <b>masses</b> from full sun habitats showed no significant mortality differences between spectral treatments, {{which is consistent with}} protection against the harmful effects of UVR. In addition, the encapsulation period of <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> in the dark was longer than the other 3 light treatments irrespective of habitat...|$|R
40|$|The {{distributions}} of European leaf roller <b>egg</b> <b>masses,</b> deposited in 2001 and 2002, were examined on Stark Crimson, Stark Spure Golden and Misket cultivars of apple (Malus communis L.) in Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey. From 70 - 80 % of the <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> {{were found on}} main and secondary branches in the canopy of the trees. Regression model provided expected vertical distribution of total numbers of <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> on all plant parts in several heights intervals. On main and secondary branches, females discriminated in ovipozition by laying more <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> in the southern and eastern quadrant and 80 - 160 cm heights intervals rather than other parts and heights. There were statistically significant differences among {{the mean number of}} <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> found on the three apple cultivars.

50|$|The <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> have an {{irregular}} honeycombed appearance, {{like those of}} Pomacea haustrum, but are smaller and have a tan to salmon color, although the <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> are white when freshly laid.|$|R
25|$|Egg {{formation}} in M. javanica {{has been studied}} in detail, and is similar to egg {{formation in}} the well studied, free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Embryogenesis has also been studied, and the stages of development are easily identifiable with a phase contrast microscope following preparation of an <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> squash. The egg is formed as one cell, with two-cell, four-cell and eight-cell stages recognisable. Further cell division leads to the tadpole stage, with further elongation resulting {{in the first stage}} juvenile, which is roughly four times as long as the egg. The J1 stage of C. elegans has 558 cells, and the J1 of M. javanica likely has a similar number, since all nematodes are morphologically and anatomically similar. The egg shell has three layers, with the vitelline layer outermost, then a chitinous layer and a lipid layer innermost.|$|E
25|$|When {{the male}} accepts female courting, the female expels eggs from the urogenitial papilla. Female Banggai {{cardinalfish}} produce {{a relatively small}} clutch, consisting {{of no more than}} ninety eggs that are two to three millimeters in diameter. Once approximately three-fourths of the <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> protrudes from the female, the male takes the eggs from her. This process is immediate, taking no more than two seconds. Eggs may be lost in the process if the male drops them, as it is usually immediately consumed by other fish in the area. Males also have the ability to detect dead eggs and expel them from his mouth. The male broods the eggs in his mouth for up to 30 days, during which it does not feed. After spawning, the female stays with the brooding male for at least few days. Females aggressively defend its territory by immediately chasing any intruders that approach the brooding male. They also exhibit relaxed form of ‘side by side trembling’, and confine the male to a small space.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} whether feeding is of practical importance has by now been clearly settled for some Chironomus species, at least; specimens that had fed on sucrose flew {{far longer than}} starved specimens, and starved females longer than starved males, which suggested they had eclosed with larger reserves of energy than the males. Some authors suggest the females and males apply the resources obtained in feeding differently. Males expend the extra energy on flight, while females use their food resources to achieve longer lifespans. The respective strategies should be compatible with maximal probability of successful mating and reproduction in those species that do not mate immediately after eclosion, and in particular in species that {{have more than one}} <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> maturing, the less developed masses being oviposited after a delay. Such variables also would be relevant to species that exploit wind for dispersal, laying eggs at intervals. Chironomids that feed on nectar or pollen may well be of importance as pollinators, but current evidence on such points is largely anecdotal. However, the content of protein and other nutrients in pollen, in comparison to nectar, might well contribute to the females' reproductive capacities.|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} {{brominated}} indole derivatives {{were found in}} the <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> of six species of muricid molluscs. Several non-brominated indoles were also present in the eggs of two Mediterranean Muricidae, although these were not found in the Australian species. Tyrindoleninone (3), was the only compound found in all six species and is likely to be responsible for the observed antimicrobial activity of these muricid <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> [1, 2].

25|$|The Utah valvata snail {{has been}} {{observed}} to produce <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> which contained 3 to 12 developing snails. <b>Egg</b> <b>masses</b> are approximately 1.0 to 1.5mm in diameter, and young snails are approximately 0.7mm in size upon emergence.|$|R
25|$|The newly moulted adult female becomes {{increasingly}} active {{for the first}} 6–7 days and seeks a host. It attaches to the final host after 7–9 days (but possibly up to 77 days). After insemination by a male tick, or sometimes before, a female feeds on blood {{in order to gain}} the nutrients for the <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> to mature. Adult females engorge for a period of 6–30 days, the time again being temperature dependent. (The 30-day engorgement time is derived from laboratory culture colonies.) Under natural conditions, the time taken for an adult female to engorge while on the host varies from 6 to 21 days, the period being longest in cool weather. When fully engorged (replete), the adult female drops off the host to the ground. After 11–20 days the gravid female starts to lay a batch of 2000 to 6000 eggs (20-200 eggs per day over 16–34 days) into moist vegetation such as leaf and branch litter, under the bark of trees and shrubs, or in foliage near the tips of branches. The eggs are attached as a mass utilising a wax-like substance. The female tick dies 1–2 days after egg laying is complete. Under laboratory conditions, female ticks have been kept alive for more than two years.|$|E
25|$|Mating and {{spawning}} {{are distinct}} events in blue crab reproduction. Males may mate {{several times and}} undergo no major changes in morphology during the process. Female blue crabs mate only once in their lifetimes during their pubertal, or terminal, molt. During this transition, the abdomen changes from a triangular to a semicircular shape. Mating in blue crab is a complex process that requires precise timing of mating {{at the time of}} the female's terminal molt. It generally occurs during the warmest months of the year. Prepubertal females migrate to the upper reaches of estuaries where males typically reside as adults. To ensure that a male can mate, he will actively seek a receptive female and guard her for up to 7 days until she molts, at which time insemination occurs. Crabs compete with other individuals before, during, and after insemination, so mate guarding is very important for reproductive success. After mating, a male must continue to guard the female until her shell has hardened. Inseminated females retain spermatophores for up to one year, which they use for multiple spawnings in high salinity water. During spawning, a female extrudes fertilized eggs onto her swimmerets and carries them in a large <b>egg</b> <b>mass,</b> or sponge, while they develop. Females migrate to the mouth of the estuary to release the larvae, the timing of which is believed to be influenced by light, tide, and lunar cycles. Blue crabs have high fecundity: females may produce up to 2 million eggs per brood.|$|E
500|$|Like all amphibians, {{the life}} of a long-toed {{salamander}} begins as an egg. In the northern extent of its range, the eggs are laid in lumpy masses along grass, sticks, rocks, or the mucky substrate of a calm pond. The number of eggs in a single mass ranges in size, possibly up to 110 eggs per cluster. Females invest a significant amount of resources into egg production, with the ovaries accounting for over 50% of the body mass in the pre-breeding season. A maximum of 264 eggs have been found in a single femalea large number considering each egg is approximately [...] in diameter. The <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> is held together by a gelatinous outer layer protecting the outer capsule of individual eggs. The eggs are sometimes laid singly, especially in warmer climates south of the Canada and US border. The egg jellies contribute a yearly supply of biological material that supports the chemistry and nutrient dynamics of shallow-water aquatic ecosystems and adjacent forest ecosystems. The eggs also provide habitat for water molds, also known as oomycetes.|$|E

50|$|Oviposition occurs along rocky {{walls of}} streams at night, from May to September in Corydalus. The females deposit coin-size <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> {{containing}} on average one thousand grey, cylindrical eggs, each egg about 1.5 mm long and 0.5 mm wide. This mass {{is covered by}} a layer of a chalky, white substance, which probably protects the eggs from desiccation and overheating.

500|$|Lobatus gigas is gonochoristic, {{which means}} each {{individual}} snail is either distinctly male or distinctly female. Females are usually larger than males in natural populations, with both sexes existing in similar proportion. After internal fertilization, the females lay eggs in gelatinous strings, {{which can be}} as long as [...] These are layered on patches of bare sand or seagrass. The sticky surface of these long egg strings allows them to coil and agglutinate, mixing with the surrounding sand to form compact egg masses, the shape of which {{is defined by the}} anterior portion of the outer lip of the female's shell while they are layered. Each one of the egg masses may have been fertilized by multiple males. The number of eggs per <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> varies greatly depending on environmental conditions such as food availability and temperature. Commonly, females produce 8–9 egg masses per season, each containing 180,000–460,000 eggs, but numbers can be as high as 750,000 eggs. L.gigas females may spawn multiple times during the reproductive season, which lasts from March to October, with activity peaks occurring from July to September.|$|E
500|$|With a few exceptions, frogs use {{external}} fertilisation. The male grasps {{the female}} tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or {{in front of}} the back legs, {{or in the case of}} Epipedobates tricolor, around the neck. They remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm. Roughened nuptial pads on the male's hands aid in retaining grip. Often the male collects and retains the <b>egg</b> <b>mass,</b> forming a sort of basket with the hind feet. An exception is the granular poison frog (Oophaga granulifera) where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously. The tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) exhibits internal fertilisation. The [...] "tail" [...] is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female. This frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs. The sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring.|$|E
500|$|The {{mating season}} in {{temperate}} climates typically {{takes place in}} autumn, while in tropical areas, mating can occur {{at any time of}} the year. To mate following courtship, the male usually leaps onto the female's back, clasping her thorax and wing bases with his forelegs. He then arches his abdomen to deposit and store sperm in a special chamber near the tip of the female's abdomen. The female lays between 10 and 400 eggs, depending on the species. Eggs are typically deposited in a froth mass-produced by glands in the abdomen. This froth hardens, creating a protective capsule, which together with the <b>egg</b> <b>mass</b> is called an ootheca. Depending on the species, the ootheca can be attached to a flat surface, wrapped around a plant, or even deposited in the ground. Despite the versatility and durability of the eggs, they are often preyed on, especially by several species of parasitoid wasps. In a few species, mostly ground and bark mantises in the family Tarachodidae, the mother guards the eggs. The cryptic Tarachodes maurus positions herself on bark with her abdomen covering her egg capsule, ambushing passing prey and moving very little until the eggs hatch. An unusual reproductive strategy is adopted by Brunner's stick mantis from the southern United States; no males have ever been found in this species, and the females breed parthenogenetically. The ability to reproduce by parthenogenesis has been recorded in at least two other species, Sphodromantis viridis and Miomantis sp., although these species usually reproduce sexually. [...] In temperate climates, adults do not survive the winter and the eggs undergo a diapause, hatching in the spring.|$|E

Whelks preferentially lay their <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> on vertical areas where urchin densities are 4 -fold less than on flat areas. This strategy is advantageous, as experimental trials showed that the loss in the mass of capsules was 4 fewer on walls than on flat areas. Nevertheless, {{a high proportion of}} <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> on walls show damage from predation. Urchins provided with <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> in the laboratory, ingested the capsules at a steady rate over a 9 -d period (5 urchins ingested 2. 8 g. d- 1). Urchins provided agar discs that included a preferred alga and whelk capsule walls ingested the discs at a rate that was half that observed for discs that only included the alga. Discs that included the preferred alga and capsule contents were eaten {{at the same rate as}} discs that only included the alga. Thus, capsule walls, but not the capsule contents, provide a defence against urchin predation. Laying aggregate <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> likely provides only a limited advantage, as the attachment surface does not increase with the number of <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> deposited together, so the risk of detachment increases.

Nine fungal isolates were found to be pathogenic to juveniles of M. hapla; six were identified as Monacrosporium sp., two as Arthrobotrys sp., and one as Hirsutella rhossiliensis. The remaining 16 fungal isolates were unable to infect <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> or juveniles, and thus were considered nonparasitic to M. hapla...|$|R
40|$|The dyes {{used for}} {{staining}} nematode <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> and <b>eggs</b> can cause environmental hazards {{and human health}} concerns. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate different artificial food dyes, as a replacement for acid fuchsin and phloxine B, for staining <b>eggs</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> of Meloidogyne javanica from infected tomato plants. Five different combinations of dyes were tested at five concentrations. For control treatments, infected roots were stained with acid fuchsin and phloxine B for coloring <b>eggs</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>masses,</b> respectively. <b>Egg</b> staining with the dyes ponceau 4 R with red 40 and ponceau 4 R with brilliant blue, at the concentration of 4 %, showed results similar to those obtained with acid fuchsin. However, <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> were effectively stained with ponceau 4 R food dyes with red 40 and with ponceau 4 R with brilliant blue at all tested concentrations. Ponceau food coloring dyes gave a good contrast for nematode <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> and <b>egg</b> counting, do not present human health and environmental pollution problems, and can be reused, with less waste being generated in the laboratory. These dyes are low-cost products that are available at most supermarkets, and can efficiently substitute acid fuchsin and phloxine B for staining <b>eggs</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>masses</b> of M. javanica. 201...|$|R
