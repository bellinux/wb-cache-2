The release of the Commodore 64 version was noted to lag behind the others but appeared in 1984. Parker Brothers also translated the game into a stand-alone tabletop <b>electronic</b> <b>game.</b> It uses a VFD screen, and has since become a rare collector's item. Q*bert was also published by Parker Brothers for the Philips Videopac in Europe, by Tsukuda Original for the Othello Multivision in Japan, and by Ultra Games for the NES in North America.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{game that}} used a {{graphical}} display, the cathode-ray tube amusement device is generally not considered under most definitions to {{be a candidate for}} the first video game, as it used purely analog hardware and did not run on a computing device; some loose definitions may still consider it a video game, but it is still usually disqualified as the device was never manufactured. Nevertheless, it is the earliest known interactive <b>electronic</b> <b>game</b> as well as the first to incorporate an electronic display, thus making it a forerunner to other games in the early history of video games. As the device was never manufactured or widely shown, however, it did not directly inspire any other games and had no impact on the future video game industry.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} (1) the removal of home access to traditional <b>electronic</b> <b>games</b> or (2) their replacement with active input <b>electronic</b> <b>games,</b> on daily physical activity and sedentary behaviour in children aged 10 – 12 years. Design: Crossover randomised controlled trial, over 6 months. Setting: Family homes in metropolitan Perth, Australia from 2007 to 2010. Participants: 10 -year-old to 12 -year-old children were recruited through school and community media. From 210 children who were eligible, 74 met inclusion criteria, 8 withdrew and 10 had insufficient primary outcome measures, leaving 56 children (29 female) for analysis. Intervention: A counterbalanced randomised order of three conditions sustained for 8 weeks each: no home access to <b>electronic</b> <b>games,</b> home access to traditional <b>electronic</b> <b>games</b> and home access to active input <b>electronic</b> <b>games.</b> Main outcome measures: Primary outcome was accelerometer assessed moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Secondary outcomes included sedentary time and diary assessed physical activity and sedentary behaviours. Results: Daily MVPA across the whole week was not significantly different between conditions. However, compared with home access to traditional <b>electronic</b> <b>games,</b> removal of all <b>electronic</b> <b>games</b> resulted in {{a significant increase in}} MVPA (mean 3. 8 min/day, 95 % CI 1. 5 to 6. 1) and a decrease in sedentary time (4. 7 min/day, 0. 0 to 9. 5) in the after-school period. Similarly, replacing traditional games with active input games resulted in a significant increase in MVPA (3. 2 min/day, 0. 9 to 5. 5) and a decrease in sedentary time (6. 2 min/day, 1. 4 to 11. 4) in the after-school period. Diary reports supported an increase in physical activity and a decrease in screen-based sedentary behaviours with both interventions. Conclusions Removal of sedentary <b>electronic</b> <b>games</b> from the child's home and replacing these with active <b>electronic</b> <b>games</b> both resulted in small, objectively measured improvements in after-school activity and sedentary time. Parents can be advised that replacing sedentary <b>electronic</b> <b>games</b> with active <b>electronic</b> <b>games</b> is likely to have the same effect as removing all <b>electronic</b> <b>games...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{ancestors}} {{to these}} games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, {{the earliest known}} interactive <b>electronic</b> <b>game</b> {{as well as the}} first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen. The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any digital computer or memory device or execute a program. It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an <b>electronic</b> <b>game,</b> was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes. This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around {{the same time as the}} device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.|$|E

5|$|The game of Nim {{running on}} the Nimrod is a {{candidate}} for one of the first video games, as {{it was one of the}} first computer games to have any sort of visual display of the game. It appeared only four years after the 1947 invention of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive <b>electronic</b> <b>game</b> to use an electronic display, and one year after Bertie the Brain, a computer similar to the Nimrod which played tic-tac-toe at the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition.

5|$|Tennis for Two is {{considered}} under some definitions {{to be the}} first video game. Other candidates with stronger candidacies from a technological standpoint include the 1947 cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive <b>electronic</b> <b>game,</b> though it did not run on a computing device; the 1950 Bertie the Brain, the earliest known game to run on a computer, though it used light bulbs for a display; and OXO and a draughts game by Christopher Strachey in 1952, the earliest digital computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Tennis for Two, though it contained no technological developments to separate it from earlier games, has the distinction of being the earliest known computer game with visuals created purely for entertainment purposes. Prior games were created primarily for academic research purposes or to demonstrate the computing power of the underlying machine, {{with the exception of the}} non-computer based cathode-ray tube amusement device. This, therefore, makes Tennis for Two the first video game under some definitions from a philosophical viewpoint rather than a technical one and a distinctive moment in the early history of video games.|$|E
5|$|The Nimrod {{was created}} {{only four years}} after the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive <b>electronic</b> <b>game,</b> and one year after a similar purpose built game-playing machine, Bertie the Brain, the first computer-based game to feature a visual display of any sort. The Nimrod is considered under some definitions one of the first video games, possibly the second. While definitions vary, the prior cathode-ray tube amusement device was a purely analog electrical game, and while the Nimrod and Bertie did not feature an electronic screen they both had a game running on a computer. The software-based tic-tac-toe game OXO and a draughts program by Christopher Strachey were programmed a year later in 1952 and were the first computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen rather than through light bulbs.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive <b>electronic</b> <b>game</b> {{as well as the}} first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, human–computer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's draughts program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students {{by the end of the}} 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E
5|$|The {{cathode-ray}} tube {{amusement device}} {{was invented by}} physicists Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. The pair worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories specializing {{in the development of}} cathode ray tubes that used electronic signal outputs to project a signal onto television screens. Goldsmith, who had received a Ph.D. in physics from Cornell University in 1936 with a focus on oscilloscope design, was {{at the time of the}} device's invention the director of research for DuMont Laboratories in New Jersey. The two inventors were inspired by the radar displays used in World War II, which Goldsmith had worked on during the war. The patent for the device was filed on January 25, 1947 and issued on December 14, 1948. The patent, the first for an <b>electronic</b> <b>game,</b> was never used by either the inventors or DuMont Laboratories, and the device was never manufactured beyond original handmade prototype. Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers historian Alex Magoun has speculated that Goldsmith did not make the prototype with the intent for it to be the basis of any future production, but only designed the device as a demonstration of the kind of commercial opportunities DuMont could pursue. Goldsmith did not work on games after the invention of the device; he was promoted to vice president in 1953 and left DuMont—by then split up and sold to other firms—to become a professor of physics at Furman University in 1966. Goldsmith kept the device and brought it with him to Furman; in a 2016 interview fellow physics professor Bill Brantley recalled Goldsmith demonstrating the game to him.|$|E
