5|$|In {{the next}} round in Europe, Hill again {{finished}} second behind Senna and ahead of a lapped Prost. In his first full season, Hill benefited <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> his veteran French team-mate. He continued to impress as the season went on, and in San Marino Hill took the lead at the start, though he was passed by Prost and Senna and ultimately retired with brake failure. More bad luck struck him in Spain where he kept pace with Prost {{for most of the}} race only for his engine to fail.|$|E
5|$|The {{matter is}} {{complicated}} by the difficulties Mulder and Scully have with dealing with the Native American population, stemming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the locals with the FBI at the Wounded Knee incident in 1973. Goodensnake's sister Gwen is also bitter that her neighbors are too frightened of native legends to confront his death. Despite these misgivings, the agents find a seeming ally in Sheriff Charles Tskany, who permits Scully to make a cursory examination of Goodensnake's body, but forbids a full autopsy. They discover that he had elongated canines, similar to those of an animal, and bears long-healed scars similar to those borne by Lyle. After parting ways with the Sheriff, Scully asks Mulder why it seems he is expecting every piece of evidence they have come across. Mulder informs Scully that forty years previously there was a similar incident in the area, which was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover and became the FBI's first X-File case.|$|E

25|$|According to the theory, {{accommodation}} is {{the process}} of reframing one's mental representation of the external world to fit new experiences. Accommodation can be understood as the mechanism by which failure leads to learning: when we act on the expectation that the world operates in one way and it violates our expectations, we often fail, but by accommodating this new experience and reframing our model of the way the world works, we learn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> failure, or others' failure.|$|E

25|$|In {{his work}} on the history of religion, Eliade is most highly {{regarded}} for his writings on Alchemy, Shamanism, Yoga and what he called the eternal return—the implicit belief, supposedly present in religious thought in general, that religious behavior is not only an imitation of, but also a participation in, sacred events, and thus restores the mythical time of origins. Eliade's thinking was in part influenced by Rudolf Otto, Gerardus van der Leeuw, Nae Ionescu and the writings of the Traditionalist School (René Guénon and Julius Evola). For instance, Eliade's The Sacred and the Profane partially builds on Otto's The Idea of the Holy to show how religion emerges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the sacred, and myths of time and nature.|$|E

25|$|In 1916, General Alexei Brusilov {{had used}} {{surprise}} and infiltration tactics during the Brusilov Offensive. Later, Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Georgii Isserson {{and other members}} of the Red Army developed a concept of deep battle <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the Polish–Soviet War. These concepts would guide Red Army doctrine throughout World War II. Realising the limitations of infantry and cavalry, Tukhachevsky was an advocate of mechanised formations and the large-scale industrialisation required. Robert Watt (2008) wrote that blitzkrieg holds little in common with Soviet deep battle. In 2002, H. P. Willmott had noted that deep battle contained two important differences: it was a doctrine of total war, not limited operations, and decisive battle was rejected in favour of several large, simultaneous offensives.|$|E
25|$|On 25 October 2011 the {{university}} of Hiroshima disclosed a plan to train {{the staff of the}} Japan Red Cross staff in how to respond to nuclear disasters like the one in Fukushima. The papers were to be signed on 26 October 2011. The president Toshimasa Asahara of the University said, he hoped that {{the university}} staff would also learn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the Red Cross in the care for disaster-disasters, including those in other countries. The University of Hiroshima University did establish a leading research center into the effects of radiation on the human body and health: the Research Institute for Radiation, Biology and Medicine, due to decades lasting studies after the effects on local population, that survived the atomic-explosion of Hiroshima in 1945.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 2011 the Japanese {{government}} {{took up the}} plan to increase the 30 members of {{the staff at the}} Japanese embassy in Kiev, Ukraine to 36. For the first time two nuclear experts and three interpreters will be stationed here. In order to learn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> this country with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe. In this way Japan hoped to build on good relations between the two countries, also because growing numbers of Japanese officials were visiting Ukraine at that moment. The new staff was expected to gather information about handling a no-go zone, the removal of radioactive materials, and how to deal with internal exposure to radiation. People affected by the Chernobyl disaster would also be questioned. The embassy was equipped with dosimeters and protection outfits for field studies. The extra costs of the additional embassy staff was estimated at 200 million yen.|$|E

25|$|The Northern {{line was}} {{originally}} scheduled {{to switch to}} automatic train operation in 2012, using the same SelTrac S40 system as used since 2009 on the Jubilee line and {{for a number of}} years on the Docklands Light Railway. Originally the work was to follow on from the Jubilee line so as to benefit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> installing it there, but that project was not completed until spring 2011. Work on the Northern line was contracted to be completed before the 2012 Olympics. It is now being undertaken in-house, and TfL predicted the upgrade would be complete by the end of 2014. The first section of the line (West Finchley to High Barnet) was transferred to the new signalling system on 26 February 2013 and the line became fully automated on 1 June 2014 with the Chalk Farm to Edgware via Golders Green section being the last part of the line to switch to ATO.|$|E
25|$|Divisions {{organised}} attacks {{according to}} SS 135 (Instructions {{for the training}} of Platoons for Offensive Action) of December 1916. The pamphlet was derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the Somme in 1916 for divisions to organise according to a common pattern and prescribed the siege warfare methods necessary for trench-to-trench attacks, the semi-open fighting, when defensive positions had been captured and open warfare techniques, for when the defence collapsed. All the sections of SS 135 addressed the problem of command when no voice communication existed by prescribing that a commander's intention must be communicated and that the infantry should {{make every effort to}} send back information by any means available, primarily by visual methods which needed specialist parties to advance with the infantry to set up relay stations, carrier pigeons, experimental wireless sets, power buzzers, signal lamps and runners, who were trained to use the terrain and know the trench systems for maximum protection.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Ministry of Construction {{issued a}} policy {{paper on the}} commercialization of public utilities. Subsequently, in October 2003, the central {{government}} decided that state-owned enterprises had {{to be separated from}} Ministries and/or provincial governments and had to be commercialized. Competitive bidding for contracts, private sector participation and commercial financing are important element in the transition to a market economy. In the 1990s, the first BOT contracts were signed for wastewater treatment plants. More than 200 wastewater treatment plants were built with some form of private sector participation in their financing and/or management, usually using the BOT formula. Early BOTs saw governments implementing the process without the benefit of financial, legal, and technical advisers, finding to their chagrin that the process becomes more complex in the absence of expert knowledge. Learning <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> past BOTs in the sector, local governments sought expert advice on bidding and public tender. In about 2000 for the first time, a BOT water project (Chengdu No. 6 Water Supply Plant) was awarded on the basis of transparent international competitive bidding, with support from the ADB. In 2004, a landmark international competitive bid for the entire water supply and sanitation system of Shenzhen was won by a joint venture including the French firm Veolia.|$|E

25|$|Its {{philosophy}} has been sketched {{out in a}} number of articles and interviews. The key ideas are those of a politics of the poor, a living politics and a people's politics. A politics of the poor is understood to mean a politics that is conducted by the poor and for the poor in a manner that enables the poor to be active participants in the struggles conducted in their name. Practically, it means that such a politics must be conducted where poor people live or in places that they can easily access, at the times when they are free, in the languages that they speak. It does not mean that middle-class people and organisations are excluded but that they are expected to come to these spaces and to undertake their politics there in a dialogical and democratic manner. There are two key aspects {{to the idea of a}} living politics. The first is that it is understood as a politics that begins not from external theory but <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the people that shape it. It is argued that political education usually operates to create new elites who mediate relationships of patronage upwards and who impose ideas on others and to exclude ordinary people from thinking politically. This politics is not anti-theory – it just asserts the need to begin from lived experience and to move on from there rather than to begin from theory (usually imported from the Global North) and to impose theory on the lived experience of suffering and resistance in the shacks. The second key aspect, of a living politics, is that political thinking is always undertaken democratically and in common. People's politics is opposed to party politics or politicians' politics (as well as to top down undemocratic forms of NGO politics) and it is argued that the former is a popular democratic project undertaken without financial reward and with an explicit refusal of representative roles and personal power while the latter is a top down, professionalised representative project driven by personal power.|$|E
