40|$|Since the Nobel Prize awarded {{discovery}} that some polymers or “plastics” {{can be made}} electronically conducting, the scientific field of organic electronics has arisen. The use of conducting polymers in electronic devices is appealing, because the materials can be processed from a liquid phase, much like ordinary non-conducting plastics. This gives the opportunity to utilize printing technologies and manufacture electronics roll-to-roll on flexible substrates, ultimately at very low costs.

40|$|Polymer {{electrolytes}} {{are widely}} used as ion transport media in vital applications such as energy storage devices and <b>electrochemical</b> <b>displays.</b> To further develop these materials, {{it is important to}} understand their ionic conductivity mechanisms. It has long been thought that ionic conduction in a polymer electrolyte occurs in the amorphous phase, while the crystalline phase is insulating. However, this picture has recently been challenged by the discovery of the crystalline system LiXF 6 ∙PEO 6 (X=P, As or Sb) which exhibits higher conductivity than its amorphous counterpart. Their structures comprise interlocking hemi-helical PEO-chain pairs containing Li+ ions and separating them from the XF 6 - anions. The first Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation study of the LiPF 6 ∙PEO 6 system is presented in this thesis. Although its conductivity is too low for most applications at ambient temperature, it can be enhanced by iso- and aliovalent anion doping. It is shown that the diffraction-determined structure is well reproduced on simulating the system using an infinite PEO-chain model. The Li-Oet coordination number here becomes 6 instead of 5; minor changes also occur in the polymer backbone configuration. The crystallographic asymmetric unit and diffraction profiles are also reproduced. On simulating a shorter-chain system (n= 22), more resembling the real material, the structure retains its double hemi-helices, but the polymer adopts a more relaxed conformation, facilitating the formation of Li+-PF 6 - pairs. Infinite-chain simulation shows the ionic conduction to be dominated by anion motion, in contrast to earlier NMR results. The effects of doping are also reproduced. Shortening the polymer chain-length has the effect of raising the transport number for lithium, thereby bring it into better agreement with experiment. It can be concluded that it is critical to take polymer chain-length and chain-termination into account when modelling ionic conductivity mechanisms in crystalline polymer electrolytes...|$|R

Cyclic voltammograms and UV-vis spectra were used to infer that the AgSRm complex on the nanoparticle surface undergoes a phase transition to give a mixture of AgSRm and Ag 2 S-like complexes.

This {{phenomenon}} has {{been referred to}} as complex voltammetric response and it has been observed during the electro-oxidation of several molecules such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and hydrogen. There are currently two explanations for the surface mechanism underlying this behavior. In one scenario, the complex voltammogram would result from the specific kinetic pathway taken during the forward sweep. In the other explanation, the phenomenon is discussed in terms of the interplay among the surface roughening and subsequent relaxation, and the ohmic drop coupled to a negative differential resistance. We report in this paper a nanogravimetric investigation of the complex voltammetric response in the electro-oxidation of methanol on platinum electrode in both acidic and alkaline media. Different periodic patterns composed of intercalated small and large hysteresis cycles were observed {{as a function of the}} applied voltage and the series resistance between the working electrode and the potentiostat. Independently, nanogravimetric results indicated no detectable difference in the delta-frequency versus voltage profile between small and large hysteresis cycles. These findings were interpreted as experimental evidence of the secondary, if any, role played by the very electrochemical reaction on the emergence of complex voltammetric response.

Electrochemical behaviors of HRP on the modified electrode were carefully investigated.

It {{is based on the}} use of dual electrode detectors pencil-drawn at the end of paper-based fluidic channels defined by hydrophobic barriers. Simultaneous detection of co-migrating species is achieved by applying to the upstream pencil-drawn working electrode a potential for the oxidation (or reduction) of both analytes, while to the downstream pencil-drawn working electrode a potential is imposed for the reverse process involving the product of the sole analyte undergoing a reversible enough electrochemical process. The performance of these inexpensive devices was preliminarily optimized by adopting hexacyanoferrate(II) as prototype species undergoing a reversible anodic process at carbon electrodes. They were then used as dual electrode detectors for thin-layer chromatographic runs conducted on paper-based microfluidic devices. Two types of synthetic solutions, one containing different contents of dopamine (DA) and ascorbic acid (AA) and the other of paracetamol (PA) and AA, were chosen as model samples. This choice was prompted us by the fact that in both cases these analytes co-migrated under the adopted experimental conditions and required similar enough oxidation potentials. Nevertheless, DA and PA underwent reversible enough anodic processes while an irreversible electrochemical reaction is involved in the AA oxidation. Satisfactory results were found for both couples of target analytes, whose simultaneous detection was achieved within 230 s and was characterized by good enough repeatability and sensitivity.

The GQDs-Nafion composite exhibits a good linear range of 5 nM to 100 μM and a limit of detection as low as 0. 45 nM in the detection of DA. The proposed <b>electrochemical</b> sensor also <b>displays</b> good selectivity and high stability and could be used for the determination of DA in real samples with satisfactory results. The present study provides a powerful avenue for the design of an ultrasensitive detection method for clinical application...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} novel ditopic bis-cobaltocenium {{receptor}} molecules containing alkyl, aryl, and calix[4]arene spacers have been synthesized via {{the reaction of}} the new synthon 1 -(ethylcarboxy) - 1 ′-(chlorocarbonyl) cobaltocenium chloride (3) or 1 -(chlorocarbonyl) cobaltocenium chloride (9) with the appropriate diamine. Proton NMR halide anion coordination studies reveal that the ethyl- (4), propyl- (5), and butyl-linked (6) derivatives form 1 : 1 stoichiometric complexes in acetonitrile solutions. Stability constant determinations suggest that the ethyl derivative 4 exhibits selectivity for the chloride anion in preference to bromide or iodide. Receptors containing larger aryl (7, 8, 10) and alkylamino (11) spacers form complexes of 2 : 1 halide anion:receptor stoichiometry. An X-ray crystal structure of the bis-cobaltocenium calix[4]arene derivative 15 is described. This receptor forms extremely stable 1 : 1 anion complexes with chloride, bromide, and H 2 PO 4 - in dimethylsulfoxide solutions and with the dicarboxylate dianion adipate in acetone. All the bis-cobaltocenium systems were found to <b>display</b> <b>electrochemical</b> recognition of varied anion guests, as shown by cyclic voltammetric experiments. Receptor 15 was also found to redox-respond to the presence of adipate. © 1995 American Chemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Three copper(II) complexes, [CuL 1], [CuL 2] and [CuL 3] where L- 1, L- 2 and L- 3 are the tetradentate di-Schiff-base ligands {{prepared}} by the condensation of acetylacetone and appropriate diamines (e. g. 1, 2 -diaminoethane, 1, 2 -diaminopropane and 1, 3 -diaminopropane, respectively) in 2 : 1 ratios, have been prepared. These complexes act as host molecules and include a guest sodium ion by coordinating through the oxygen atoms to result in corresponding new trinuclear complexes, [(CuL 1) (2) Na(ClO 4) (H 2 O) ][CuL 1], [(CuL 2) (2) Na(ClO 4) (H 2 O) ] (2) and [(CuL 3) (2) Na(ClO 4) (H 2 O) ] (3) when crystallized from methanol solution containing sodium perchlorate. All three complexes have been characterized by single crystal X-ray crystallography. In all the complexes, the sodium cation has a six-coordinate distorted octahedral environment being bonded to four oxygen atoms from two Schiff-base complexes of Cu(II) {{in addition to a}} perchlorate anion and a water molecule. The copper atoms are four coordinate in a square planar environment being bonded to two oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms of the Schiff-base ligand. The variable temperature susceptibilities for complexes 1 - 3 were measured over the range 2 - 300 K. The isotropic Hamiltonian, H = g(1) beta HS 1 + g(2) beta HS 2 + J(12) S(1) S(2) + g(3) beta HS 3 for complex 1 and H = g(1) beta HS 1 + g 2 beta HS 2 +J(12) S(1) S(2) for complexes 2 and 3 has been used to interpret the magnetic data. The best fit parameters obtained are: g(1) = g(2) = 2. 07 (0), J = - 1. 09 (1) cm(- 1) for complex 1, g(1) = g(2) = 2. 06 (0), J = - 0. 55 (1) cm(- 1) for complex 2 and g 1 = g 2 = 2. 07 (0).

40|$|Nickel is an {{attractive}} metal {{for use in a}} wide variety of catalytic transformations that normally require precious metals. Of particular interest is the reduction of CO 2 to formate, which is a potential hydrogen storage medium, fuel, and chemical building block. The nickel bis-diphosphine class of complexes has recently been studied for this application. However, it has been found that existing nickel bis-diphosphine complexes cannot produce hydrides that are capable of reducing CO 2 to form formate. 	In this dissertation, I first provide a detailed analysis of the thermodynamic relationships which are responsible for the inadequate reduction power of hydrides formed by known nickel bis-diphosphines. It is established that by designing complexes with a more negative reduction potential than that of a typical nickel bis-diphosphine complex, more powerfully reducing hydrides may be formed. N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands are chosen as a substitute for phosphine ligands in this system, as NHC ligands are generally more electron donating than typical phosphine ligands, and are thus expected to result in complexes with more negative reduction potentials. 	By direct analogy to known nickel bis-diphosphine complexes, homoleptic nickel bis(NHC) complexes are synthesized. These are found to form sterically hindered, highly reducing Ni(0) compounds upon reduction. These Ni(0) compounds are the first group 10 M(0) (M = nickel, palladium, platinum) tetracarbene complexes reported. They display an unusual sawhorse geometry in the Ni(0) state. 	In order to address the <b>electrochemical</b> irreversibility <b>displayed</b> the nickel tetracarbene complexes, a less sterically encumbering bis(NHC) ligand linked by a propyl group is chosen. This ligand is found to provide access to the [Ni(NHC 2) ] 2 + fragment, which in turn provides access to a new Ni(II) (NHC 2) ¬L 2 class of complexes. Four Ni(II) (NHC 2) ¬(bipyridine) complexes are synthesized and characterized. It is found that a rigid, twice-linked bis(NHC) ligand is capable of imparting electrochemical reversibility to these systems. 	This new bis(NHC) ligand is used to synthesize the first Ni(II) (NHC 2) (diphosphine) complex. This compound is isolated in both the Ni(II) and Ni(0) oxidation states. Strategies to further develop this system in order to be suitable for CO 2 reduction are discussed. Future experiments involving the [Ni(NHC 2) ] 2 + fragment are also suggested...|$|R
40|$|The carrier {{transport}} properties in nanocrystalline semiconductors and organic materials {{play a key}} role for modern organic/inorganic devices such as dye-sensitized (DSC) and organic solar cells, organic and hybrid light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors, and <b>electrochemical</b> sensors and <b>displays.</b> Carrier transport in these materials usually occurs by transitions in a broad distribution of localized states. As a result the transport is dominated by thermal activation to a band of extended states (multiple trapping), or if these do not exist, by hopping via localized states. We provide a general view of the physical interpretation of the variations of {{carrier transport}} coefficients (diffusion coefficient and mobility) with respect to the carrier concentration, or Fermi level, examining in detail models for carrier transport in nanocrystalline semiconductors and organic materials with the following distributions: single and two-level systems, exponential and Gaussian density of states. We treat both the multiple trapping models and the hopping model in the transport energy approximation. The analysis is simplified by thermodynamic properties: the chemical capacitance, Cm, and the thermodynamic factor, wn, that allow us to derive many properties of the chemical diffusion coefficient, Dn, used in Fick’s law. The formulation of the generalized Einstein relation for the mobility to diffusion ratio shows that the carrier mobility is proportional to the jump diffusion coefficient, DJ, that is derived from single particle random walk. Characteristic experimental data for nanocrystalline TiO 2 in DSC and electrochemically doped conducting polymers are discussed in the light of these model...|$|R
