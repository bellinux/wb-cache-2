5|$|Having been forewarned {{about the}} attack, the Portuguese {{commander}} {{had been able}} to begin preparations for the assault; however, he had planned on receiving a frontal assault and when the force came under attack from the rear <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> surprised. The Portuguese attempted to entrench themselves in rifle pits, but they became disoriented after Pinto and several other officers were slain early in the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Mexico on 20 March, {{the fleet}} {{underwent}} {{three weeks of}} target practice. Rear Admiral Evans was relieved of command during this time, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> bedridden and in constant pain, so on 30 March, Connecticut set sail north at full speed. She was met two days later by the schooner , which took the admiral to a hospital. Connecticut traveled back south to rejoin the fleet, and Rear Admiral Charles M. Thomas took Evans's place on Connecticut as {{the commander of the}} fleet, which continued its journey north, bound for California.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourteenth}} season, Bart {{convinced}} Krusty {{to run for}} Congress so that Krusty could introduce an airline rerouting bill and stop planes from flying over the Simpsons' house. Krusty agreed and ran on the Republican ticket. Although his campaign started off badly, Lisa suggested that he try connecting with regular families, which Krusty did, resulting in a landslide victory. Krusty's term started off badly, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> ignored by his new, more politically savvy colleagues. With {{the help of the}} Simpsons and an influential doorman, however, Krusty succeeded in passing his bill.|$|E

5|$|Phu's {{excessive}} {{preoccupation with}} secrecy, however, doomed the effort from the beginning. Operational planning was limited {{only to a}} few trusted subordinates who had either contributed to or knew about it. Staff work was non-existent. The {{chief of staff of}} II Corps, for example, admitted that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> in the dark about the planned abandonment of Pleiku and Kon Tum. Command of the convoy itself was handed over to the commander of the II Corps Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Although Shishman's realm was {{nominally}} a Serbian client {{state for}} an unknown time, he retained his prior semi-independence and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> {{in charge of}} his lands. He maintained good relations with Bulgaria and, according to Andreev, his political activity was mainly concentrated in dealing with Bulgaria. He also retained his close ties with Nogai and his descendants. In 1301–1302, Shishman provided political refuge to several of Nogai's relatives, including his grandson Qara-Kesek, who fled to Vidin along with a 3,000-strong cavalry and remained there until after 1325. These Tatar nobles were fleeing from the persecution of the new khan, Toqta, who had defeated and murdered Nogai in 1299–1300. Contrary to Andreev's opinion, Fine believes that the death of Nogai increased Serbia's influence over Vidin.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Boisselier {{converted}} to Raëlism, a UFO religion {{founded by the}} French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël, in 1973. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she felt strongly that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> honest and joined his movement. She had left her husband, alleging violent behavior, shortly before her conversion; afterwards, owing to her involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child. Boisselier believed that religious intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child's custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child converted. In the 1990s, Raëlism was seen as dangerous and viewed with disdain in France, resulting in loss of employment for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.|$|E

5|$|John Thomas Perceval, {{the son of}} Spencer Perceval, {{spent about}} a year at Brislington House, from 1831 until February 1832, {{followed}} by two years at Ticehurst House, Ticehurst in Sussex. In Brislington House Perceval experienced, {{in spite of the}} expense, a regime of deprivation, brutality and degradation. For eight months, during which time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> under the control of his voices, spirits and presences, he was kept under restraint, either in a straitjacket or tied down in bed. Treatment consisted of cold baths and an operation to sever his temporal artery. He was later {{one of the founders of}} the Alleged Lunatics' Friend Society and acted as their honorary secretary for about twenty years. Perceval's two books about his experience in asylums were republished by the anthropologist Gregory Bateson in 1962, and in recent years he has been hailed as a pioneer of the mental-health advocacy movement.|$|E
5|$|Louis Braille {{survived the}} torment of the {{infection}} {{but by the}} age of five <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> blind in both eyes. Due to his young age, Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight, and often asked why it was always dark. His parents made many efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion, and he prospered in their care. He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him, and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability. Braille's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests, and he was accommodated with higher education.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} Positivists in Brazil was Lieutenant-colonel Benjamim Constant, a professor in the Military Academy. Although admired to the point of veneration by the young cadets, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> unknown to the public. Constant and other Positivist instructors inculcated students with his ideology. Gradually consigned to the background of the Academy's curriculum were military exercises and military studies of Antoine-Henri Jomini and Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz, replaced by a focus on political discussions and readings from Auguste Comte and Pierre Lafitte. The cadets soon became insubordinate political agitators. Even so, Positivists still expected to make a peaceful transition to their fantasy of a republican dictatorship and Constant, who had also taught the emperor's grandsons, met with Pedro II and tried to convince him join their cause. Unsurprisingly, given Pedro II's character, this proposal was steadfastly refused, and Constant began to believe that there was no remaining alternative to a coup d'état.|$|E

5|$|When {{his brother}} and {{sister-in-law}} were forced to move for business reasons, he bought his own house at 328 Mickle Street (now 330 Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard). First {{taken care of by}} tenants, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> bedridden for {{most of his time in}} Mickle Street. During this time, he began socializing with Mary Oakes Davis—the widow of a sea captain. She was a neighbor, boarding with a family in Bridge Avenue just a few blocks from Mickle Street. She moved in with Whitman on February 24, 1885, to serve as his housekeeper in exchange for free rent. She brought with her a cat, a dog, two turtledoves, a canary, and other assorted animals. During this time, Whitman produced further editions of Leaves of Grass in 1876, 1881, and 1889.|$|E
25|$|On {{the liberation}} of France, Guitry {{was among the first}} arrested, by a self-appointed militia. He was interned in a {{detention}} camp at Drancy, and suffered ill-effects on his health that necessitated his transfer to a Paris nursing home. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> cleared of all accusations of collaboration, but the experience left him disillusioned.|$|E
25|$|However, {{immediately}} before War of Bavarian Succession, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> disgraced.

Stutterheim retired to his estate at Kloster Mansfeld and died there on 29 March 1780.|$|E

25|$|In 1808, Napoleon ennobled Lapisse and {{transferred}} him to Spain where he led his division at Espinosa.

25|$|At the 1995 World Championship, White was {{involved}} in a controversial first-round match against South African Peter Francisco. From 2–2 White was able to pull away and win convincingly by 10 frames to 2. Shortly after it emerged that large sums of money had been placed on White to win the match by the eventual scoreline. The ensuing investigation found Francisco guilty of misconduct and banned him for five years. However no evidence was found against White, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>completely</b> cleared of any wrongdoing.|$|E
25|$|On the Confederate side, Lee {{received}} some intelligence reports {{that made him}} believe Grant was planning to withdraw toward Fredericksburg.
