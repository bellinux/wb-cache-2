40|$|In {{this the}} fourth and final part of this article series we apply {{synthesis}} methods to isolated single-ended flyback and forward converters and push pull converters to achieve equivalent converters with terminal ripple current and common mode noise cancellation. Figure 1. A PWM flyback converter. Background Figure 1 illustrates a conventional single-ended flyback converter with some of its parasitic circuit elements. The circuit has both pulsating input current and pulsating output current which generates conducted differential mode noise at both line and load terminals. The high dV dt nodes are unbalanced so common mode noise from displacement currents is potentially a big problem. Figure 1 illustrates two of the displacement current paths, although {{there are several other}} important displacement current paths not shown.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{one system}} in which the <b>terminal</b> <b>dots</b> of a one-dimensional quantum-dot chain couple equally to the left and right leads and study the influence of PT-symmetric complex potentials on the quantum transport process. It is found {{that in the case of}} the Hermitian Hamiltonian, remarkable decoupling and antiresonance phenomena have an opportunity to co-occur in the transport process. For the chains with odd(even) dots, all their even(odd) -numbered molecular states decouple from the leads. Meanwhile, antiresonance occurs at the positions of the even(odd) -numbered eigenenergies of the sub-chains without <b>terminal</b> <b>dots.</b> When the PT-symmetric complex potentials are introduced to the <b>terminal</b> <b>dots,</b> the decoupling phenomenon is found to transform into the Fano antiresonance. In addition, it shows that appropriate magnetic flux can interchange the roles of the odd and even molecular states. These results can assist to understand the quantum transport modified by the PT symmetry in non-Hermitian discrete systems. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that quantum dots injected into two model tumors rapidly migrate to sentinel lymph nodes. PEG-coated quantum <b>dots</b> having <b>terminal</b> carboxyl, amino, or methoxyl groups all migrated from the tumor to surrounding lymph nodes similarly. Passage from the tumor through lymphatics to adjacent nodes could be visualized dynamically through the skin; {{at least two}} nodes could usually be defined.
