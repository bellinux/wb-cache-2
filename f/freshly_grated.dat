Carrots must first be grated and then dried before cooking. The grated carrots are then put into a heated pan with a specific amount of milk or khoya and sugar. After stirring for 4-5 minutes, roughly chopped cashew nuts are added and 10-15 minutes later a specific amount of pure ghee is added as well.

5000|$|In India, Carnival {{is celebrated}} {{only in the}} state of Goa and a Roman Catholic tradition, where it is known as Intruz which means [...] "swindler" [...] while Entrudo is the {{appropriate}} word in Portuguese for [...] "Carnival".

The tradition was introduced by the Portuguese who ruled Goa for over four centuries. On Tuesday preceding Ash Wednesday, the European tradition of Fat Tuesday is celebrated with the eating of crepes, also called [...] "AleBelle". The crepes are filled with <b>freshly</b> <b>grated</b> coconut and heated condensed coconut sap that sequentially converts it into a brown sweet molasses; additional heat concentration solidifies it to jaggery. The celebrations of Carnival peak for three days and nights and precede Ash Wednesday, when the legendary King Momo takes over the state.

Powell moved into the attic above the Fishers and became lifelong friends with Mary. He described the food at the Fishers' pensione: [...] Oh my god, how was the food? Jim it was heavenly!

40|$|Armoracia rusticana (Horseradish, Brassica family) is a root {{characterized}} by a pungent taste and smell that is released from glucosinolates (GLSs) hydrolysis. GLSs are hydrolyzed by the endogenous enzyme myrosinase (MYR) upon cells damage, producing volatile breakdown products, such as isothiocyanates (ITCs) [1]. ITCs are also known to have anticarcinogenic properties, thus their formation has a health benefit for consumers [2]. Horseradish is widely consumed <b>freshly</b> <b>grated</b> or mixed with vinegar as sauce. Due to its very long growing season, horseradish is only available for few months a year, and the storage affects pungency of horseradish. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate how different horseradish preparations and storage temperatures affect the GLSs, MYR and ITCs levels. Horseradish was collected from Basilicata (Italy) and investigated as (1) grated and (2) grated with vinegar and olive oil (sauce). Both products were stored for 2 months at 4 ˚C and - 20 ˚C. GLSs, MYR and ITCs were measured in the untreated, fresh prepared and stored samples. No MYR activity was detected in the sauce, probably due to the low pH of vinegar (pH = 2. 8).

The prevalence of Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA) among the low income house-hold {{is high in}} developing countries due to low intake of dietary iron. Developing an intervention strategy for IDA {{is a major concern}} and food fortification is considered the sustainable strategy to alleviate IDA. <b>Freshly</b> <b>grated</b> cassava tubers were divided into four subsamples; A-C and then mixed with Ferrous Sulphate (FS), Iron (III) sulphate (F 3) and Ferric Alum (FA), respectively in ratio 1 : 5000 (0. 2 g fortificant kg - 1 mash). The samples along with the Control (D) were each fermented in a solid state for 24 h and stir-fried to obtain gari granules. The gari samples were fed to rats divided into four groups of five for fourteen days and the serum, then analyzed for serum iron concentration, Total Iron Binding Capacity (TIBC) and hemoglobin concentration. The results showed significant increase (p - 1) and hemoglobin (13. 63 ± 2. 8 g dL - 1) and significantly lower level (55. 5 ± 2. 2 μmol L - 1) of TIBC(p< 0. 05), indicating a better iron bioavailabilty.
