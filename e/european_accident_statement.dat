Nevertheless it illustrates some of the value that can be gained from the collection and analysis of in-depth accident data. The EC SafetyNet project produced two crash database processes which examined different aspects of the <b>European</b> <b>accident</b> problem.

40|$|In this paper, {{neutronics}} {{and severe}} safety characteristics of Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) and Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor (SFR) cores concurrently breeding plutonium and burning minor actinides (MAs) are investigated. For LFR, two core variants were modeled: with active core part 90 cm and 120 cm tall.

It is shown that both 1500 MWth LFR and SFR start-up cores can transmute on average 70 kg of MAs annually in the homogeneous mode. In this case, 5 % of MAs were admixed to the core fuel. More than 110 kg of MAs can be burned per year when 10 % of MAs are additionally added to axial and radial blankets. LFR core designs show advantages over SFR cores regarding severe safety behavior due to higher thermal inertia, better natural circulation behavior and the higher boiling point of lead. JRC.

40|$|Management of risk {{in complex}} domains such as {{aviation}} {{relies heavily on}} post-event investigations, requiring complex approaches to fully understand the integration of multi-causal, multi-agent and multi-linear accident sequences. The Event Analysis of Systemic Teamwork methodology (EAST; Stanton et al. 2008) offers such an approach based on network models. In this paper, we apply EAST to a well-known aviation accident case study, highlighting communication between agents as a central theme and investigating the potential for finding agents who were key to the accident. Ultimately, this work aims {{to develop a new}} model based on distributed situation awareness (DSA) to demonstrate that the risk inherent in a complex system is dependent on the information flowing within it. By identifying key agents and information elements, we can propose proactive design strategies to optimize the flow of information and help work towards avoiding aviation <b>accidents.</b> <b>Statement</b> of Relevance: This paper introduces a novel application of an holistic methodology for understanding aviation accidents.

Grabbing the wrist of another, he realizes that it is an alert Beowulf, and that he has grabbed his arm. They wrestle furiously, during which Beowulf appears to become a flaming, dragon-like figure and repeats many of the ideas that the dragon revealed to Grendel. As Beowulf gains the upper hand, Grendel tells himself that were it not for a slip on a puddle of blood, Beowulf would not be in control of their battle. The Geat slams Grendel into the walls of the hall, demanding that Grendel sing about the hardness of walls. This is a continuation of Grendel's poetic exploration of philosophy. He then rips off Grendel's arm, causing the monster to flee in pain and fear. Grendel feels as though everything is unnaturally clear, leading him to toss himself into an abyss (whether or not Grendel jumps is left up to the perception of the reader). He notes as he dies that the only creatures attending his [...] "funeral" [...] are the animals he so despised.

30|$|This Topical Collection {{contains}} five papers {{based on}} the research conducted in the project Vulnerable Road Users using Intelligent Transport Systems (VRUITS), which was co-funded by the European Commission in the 7 th Framework Programme, and lasted from April 2013 to March 2016. The main object of the VRUITS project was to research how Intelligent Transport Systems can contribute to improve the safety, mobility and comfort of Vulnerable Road Users. The accident analysis performed in the VRUITS project focused on specific road user types for which statistics are available: pedestrians, cyclists and PTW riders, which include low speed scooters, mopeds and motorcyclists, are treated as separate groups. The VRUITS project started by identifying the most critical traffic scenarios for VRUs, through analysis of both <b>European</b> <b>accident</b> databases, such as CARE, and national databases [4]. For pedestrians, the most critical scenarios for pedestrians are crossing the road at mid-block. For cyclists and PTWs, the most critical scenarios are intersection scenarios, when the vehicle pulls out {{into the path of}} an oncoming VRU or turns into the VRU’s path.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe PRACT Project (Predicting Road ACcidents – a Transferable {{methodology}} across Europe) is {{an ongoing}} project aimed at developing a <b>European</b> <b>accident</b> prediction model structure that could, with proper calibration, be applied to different European road networks. The core principles behind the PRACT project structure are that:•it is unrealistic to think that one unique Accident Prediction Model (APM) model with {{a unique set of}} Crash Modification Factors (CMFs) can actually be developed, valid for all Europe and for all the different type of networks;•the development of a specific APM model and a set of CMFs based on local data is extremely time consuming and expensive and requires data and experience that most road administrations do not have;•the development of “local” CMFs only based on historical local data prevents the possibility of evaluating the effectiveness of new technologies. The PRACT project addresses these issues by developing a practical guideline and a user friendly tool that will allow for an easier implementation of APMs and CMFs in different countries and on different road networks...|$|R

This thesis covers the pre-stage of the AEB-sensor development, from the pre-study of different <b>European</b> <b>accident</b> databases to get a better understanding of which type of accidents are the most common and which cases are the most severe, to the Naturalistic Driving Study performed in Barcelona, to record a big amount of critical situations between the driver and the VRU. The Naturalistic Driving Study was performed with a vehicle equipped with a Lidar (Light Detection And Ranging), two cameras, CAN (Controller Area Network) -system information and a VBOX. All the critical situations was then analyzed using 58 different parameters, from VRU head and torso orientation, weather conditions to intersection type and relative velocity. The main objective of this thesis is to present a conclusion of how the VRU and the driver react to a critical situation.

The content of the conversation was manipulated and participants also had to enter a text message. Data were compared with just cycling and cycling while listening to music. Telephoning coincided with reduced speed, reduced peripheral vision performance and increased risk and mental effort ratings. Text messaging had the largest negative impact on cycling performance.

An important part of the PRACT project involves the review of the recent and salient literature on Crash Modification Factors (CMFs) with the aim of understanding CMF availability and identifying CMF needs in Europe. In addition, a survey of 23 National Road Authorities (NRAs) from 20 countries was completed to understand CMF use and CMF needs within NRAs. The survey identified a number of CMFs that are useful to NRAs but not readily available. Based on both the literature review and the NRA survey, the PRACT project developed some key CMFs that are currently missing or underrepresented in the literature. CMFs were developed for motorways and 2 -way rural roads using data from Italy, England and Germany. A number of CMFs were developed, including for work zones, speed enforcement, high friction wearing course, traffic composition, horizontal curvature and vertical gradient.

This study has investigated the feasibility and potential impact of Q-dummies and new injury criteria for child restraint system assessment in frontal impact. <b>European</b> <b>accident</b> statistics have been reviewed for all ECE-R 44 CRS groups. For frontal impact, injury measures are recommended for the head, neck, chest and abdomen. Priority of body segment protection depends on the ECE-R 44 group. The Q-dummy family is able to reflect these injuries, because of its biofidelity performance and measurement capabilities for these body segments. Currently, the Q 0, Q 1, Q 1. 5, Q 3 and Q 6 are available representing children of 0, 1, 1. 5, 3 and 6 years old. These Q-dummies cover almost all dummy weight groups as defined in ECE-R 44. Q 10, representing a 10 year-old child, is under development. New child dummy injury criteria are under discussion in EEVC WG 12. Therefore, the ECE-R 44 criteria are assessed by comparing the existing P-dummies and new Q-dummies in ECE-R 44 frontal impact sled tests. In total 300 tests covering 30 CRSs of almost all existing child seat categories are performed by 11 European organizations.
