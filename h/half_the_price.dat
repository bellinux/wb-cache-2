It was the third of three solo albums Frith made for the label.|$|E
5|$|Cheap at <b>Half</b> <b>the</b> <b>Price</b> was {{recorded}} by Frith {{at his home}} in New York City on a 4-track machine. He played all the instruments himself, with the exception of bass guitar on two tracks, and drums, for which he used tapes and samples previously recorded by other drummers. The record differed from Frith's previous experimental albums in that it consisted largely of pop-like songs, and he sang for the first time.|$|E

5|$|US Internet also {{provides}} wired fiber optic connections that were available, as of April 2014, to around 12,600 residents of Minneapolis. Connections ran {{as quickly as}} one Gbps for $99 per month, about <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of a 25 Mbps connection from Comcast. Later that year, the company announced plans to bring its internet services farther afield to the broader Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area and nationally. US Internet announced in December {{of the same year}} that it would bring 10 Gbit/s service to Minneapolis making it the first municipality in the world to have access at that speed.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{began taking}} pre-orders for the first-generation iPad on March 12, 2010. The only major {{change to the}} device between its {{announcement}} and being available to pre-order was the change {{of the behavior of}} the side switch to perform either sound muting or screen rotation locking (user selectable). The Wi-Fi version of the iPad went on sale in the United States on April 3, 2010. The Wi-Fi+3G version was released on April 30. 3G service in the United States is provided by AT and was initially sold with two prepaid contract-free data plan options: one for unlimited data and the other for 250MB per month at <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price.</b> On June 2, 2010, AT announced that effective June 7 the unlimited plan would be replaced for new customers with a 2GB plan at slightly lower cost; existing customers would have the option to keep the unlimited plan. The plans are activated on the iPad itself and can be cancelled at any time.|$|E
5|$|Minibuses are {{the most}} common type of public {{transportation}} in Mogadishu. The next most frequently used public vehicles in the city are auto rickshaws (bajaj). They number around 3,000 units and come in various designs. The auto rickshaws represent a lower cost alternative to taxis and minibuses, typically charging <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> for the same distance, with flexible rates. Due to their affordability, capacity to negotiate narrow lanes and low fuel consumption, the three-wheeled vehicles are often appealing investment opportunities for small-scale entrepreneurs. They are generally preferred for shorter commutes. In June 2013, two new taxi companies also started offering road transportation to residents. Part of a fleet of over 100 vehicles, Mogadishu Taxi's trademark yellow cabs offer rides throughout the city at flat rates of $5. City Taxi, the firm's nearest competitor, charges the same flat rate, with plans to add new cabs to its fleet.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} senior Bowie died circa 1820, he gave ten slaves {{as well as}} horses and cattle to both James and Rezin. For the next seven years, the {{brothers}} worked together to develop several large estates in Lafourche Parish and Opelousas. Louisiana's population was growing rapidly, and the brothers hoped {{to take advantage of}} its rising land prices through speculation. Without the capital required to buy large tracts, they entered into a partnership with pirate Jean Lafitte in 1818 to raise money. By then, the United States had outlawed the importation of slaves, and most southern states allowed anyone who informed on a slave trader to receive half of what the imported slaves would earn at auction as a reward. Bowie made three trips to Lafitte's compound on Galveston Island. On each occasion, he bought smuggled slaves and took them directly to a customhouse to inform on his own actions. When the customs officers offered the slaves for auction, Bowie purchased them and received back <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> he had paid, as allowed by the state laws. He then could legally transport the slaves and resell them at a greater market value in New Orleans or areas farther up the Mississippi River. Using this scheme, the brothers collected $65,000 to be used for their land speculation.|$|E

25|$|Union Rotorua {{was built}} by Broken Hill Pty (BHP) at the Whyalla Steelworks in South Australia. She was {{launched}} on 19 January 1976.

25|$|Pollock's {{work after}} 1951 was darker in color, {{including}} a collection painted in black on unprimed canvases.

Parsons later sold one to a friend at <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price.</b> The departure from his earlier style wasn't what his collectors wanted. These works show Pollock attempting to find a balance between abstraction and depictions of the figure.|$|E

25|$|The Chinese {{diaspora}} first reactivated its familial {{links in}} order to import low-priced goods such cups, forks, cellular phone, radio, television sets and umbrellas to Africa Indeed, African society has a screaming need for cheap goods in large quantities. China's manufacturing industry is truly complementary to African markets, often producing more cheaply than most African manufacturers can, and with better quality. Cheap Chinese clothes, and cheap Chinese cars at <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of western ones allow African customers to suddenly raise up the purchasing power.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{the card}} was {{available}} for second class travel and 50% discount only, but at Christmas 1992 the BahnCard First for the first class was launched along with gift vouchers for the new product. By {{the end of the}} year, it was bought by 650,000 clients. A major advertising campaign was started by the (then called) Bundesbahn, where the card was marketed under the slogan travel for a year for <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price.</b> The TV advertising campaign for the new product won several awards.|$|E
25|$|After the {{discontinuation}} of the S.U.B, more marketing {{emphasis was}} placed on licensed OLP budget versions of the StingRay 4, Stingray 5, StingRay 4 HH, and StingRay 5 HH. However, as of 2009 the entire OLP brand has been retired. Since then, the Ernie Ball produced Sterling by Music Man range of mid-priced basses and guitars have been introduced (not {{to be confused with the}} Music Man Sterling bass guitar). The Ray 34 (four string), and Ray 35 (five string), are offered at nearly <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of their Music Man counterparts.|$|E

25|$|The Type 94 Tankette was an {{inexpensive}} vehicle to build, at approximately <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank, resulting in more Type 94's entering service {{than any other}} Japanese tankette (823 units). Production included 300 units in 1935, 246 units in 1936, 200 units in 1937 and 70 units in 1938. Given {{the utility of the}} design in combat in China, the Imperial Japanese Army was therefore content to retain the Type 94, although the design, and indeed the concept of the tankette, came to be regarded as obsolescent in Western armies.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to calculators, MITS made {{a line of}} test equipment kits. These included an IC tester, a waveform generator, a digital voltmeter, and several other instruments. To {{keep up with the}} demand, MITS moved into a larger building at 6328 Linn NE in Albuquerque in 1973. They installed a wave soldering machine and an assembly line at the new location. In 1972, Texas Instruments developed its own calculator chip and started selling complete calculators at less than <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of other commercial models. MITS and many other companies were devastated by this, and Roberts struggled to reduce his quarter-million-dollar debt.|$|E
25|$|Like the H/ZBJ-1 combat data {{system on}} board, the JRSCCS is {{distributed}} and redundant and reflects both Russian and Western influence. From the Russian/Soviet tradition, each sensor handles {{as much of}} its own data processing as possible. While this potentially allows the design of individual system components to be simplified, the Chinese followed the Western tradition by ensuring central components can still process all information from the sensors {{in the event of}} sensor hardware malfunction. The cost of such redundancy is such that <b>half</b> <b>the</b> <b>price</b> of the ship is in its C4I systems. Another Western design tradition incorporated was the use of an open architecture software design.|$|E
