5|$|Falkner Island Light {{was chosen}} for fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the Smithsonian Institution, the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and whistles and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof. The structure is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. The dwelling is made of granite and the lantern made of cast iron. The original Fresnel lens was installed in the new tower. In 1890, a <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> was installed {{and it would be}} replaced by a siren in 1905. The siren caused much distress to nearby residents and had to be modified.|$|E
25|$|Around 11:45 PM, The {{oil tanker}} S.C.T. Dodd of the Standard Oil Company of California began exchanging <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> blasts with the San Juan. Not long afterwards, the San Juan {{appeared}} {{in front of}} the S.C.T. Dodd's bow. Both the San Juan and S.C.T. Dodd were ordered to reverse thrust to prevent a collision. Unfortunately, despite all efforts, the S.C.T. Dodd collided with the San Juan's stern on her portside. Some survivors reported the collision was not greatly noticeable in feeling. On the San Juan, steward William Gano's bunk was partially destroyed when the S.C.T. Dodd's steel bow plowed straight through his room. Gano was able to escape by climbing up a rope leading to the San Juan's main deck. The collision destroyed one of the San Juan's lifeboats.|$|E
50|$|Aids to Navigational Services {{organized}} {{along the}} Turkish coast {{are to be}} rendered with 417 lighthouses, 34 light-buoys, 19 marking buoys, 15 <b>fog</b> <b>whistles,</b> 2 <b>fog</b> bell and 3 beacon 9 racon equipments.|$|R
5000|$|Other aids to {{navigation}} including bells on {{boats and}} <b>fog</b> <b>whistles,</b> including {{one on the}} north side of the channel, were in operation by at least 1908. [...] The fog keeper and assistant keeper lived at the actual station. There was nearby housing for their families although none of the buildings remains.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye. He'd go lolloping {{about in}} the Channel {{if there was any}} fog on, {{steering}} for the lights o' any steamers or headin' round for all the <b>fog</b> <b>whistles</b> if it was too thick to see. Sooner or later, as sure as fate, he'd get cut down to the water's edge. Lor', it was a fine game! Half a 'yard o' print about his noble conduc' in the newspapers, and maybe a leader about the British tar and unexpected emergencies. It once went the length o' a subscription. Ha! ha!" [...] Miggs laughed until he choked.|$|R
500|$|Great Captain Island Lighthouse is a {{lighthouse}} on Great Captain Island {{in the western}} Long Island Sound {{off the coast of}} Greenwich, Connecticut, United States. Built in 1829, the first lighthouse, made of stone, was of such poor construction that the walls were severely cracked a decade later. In 1868, a new granite dwelling with attached lantern was completed. The lighthouse is of the same design as lighthouses at Sheffield Island in Norwalk; Morgan Point in Noank; Old Field Point Light and Plum Island in New York; and Block Island North in Rhode Island. In 1890, a <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> was added, in 1905 a siren was installed. The lighthouse was deactivated in 1970 when a skeletal tower replaced it. The Town of Greenwich acquired the property in 1973 and had full-time caretakers on the site until the lighthouse became too dilapidated in 2003. A successful restoration effort was completed in 2009 and a non-navigational light was activated in 2012. In 2010, a memorial plaque was installed to [...] "honor the 23 people who lived in Greenwich, or had a connection to the town", who died in the September 11, 2001 attacks. In 1991, the Great Captain Island Light was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5000|$|Montara Lighthouse Station — A <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> was {{completed}} 1873 on Point Montara. In 1880 a coal fueled double horn system was installed, and in 1900 a kerosene lantern {{was placed on}} a post near the <b>fog</b> <b>whistle.</b> In 1928, the present Point Montara lighthouse was constructed.|$|E
50|$|Smoke {{conductors}} {{were installed}} in 1860 {{due to the}} fact that the calm weather could not sufficiently clear the smoke from the lantern room. In 1874 a building was built which contained a steam <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> that had blasts of 5 seconds that were separated by 25 seconds of silence.|$|E
2500|$|Huron was {{equipped}} with one acetylene lens lantern, , a [...] steam <b>whistle</b> <b>fog</b> horn, and a hand operated bell.|$|R

50|$|The ship reached Pointe-au-Père, Quebec (or Father Point) {{near the}} town of Rimouski {{in the early hours of}} 29 May 1914, where the pilot disembarked. Empress of Ireland resumed a normal outward bound course of about N76E, and soon sighted the {{masthead}} lights of , a Norwegian collier, on her starboard bow at a distance of several miles. Likewise, Storstad, which was abreast of Métis Point and on a course W. by S., sighted Empress of Irelands masthead lights. The first sightings were made in clear weather conditions, but fog soon enveloped the ships. The ships resorted to repeated use of their <b>fog</b> <b>whistles.</b> At about 02:00 local time Storstad crashed into Empress of Irelands starboard side at around midships. Storstad remained afloat, but Empress of Ireland was severely damaged. A gaping hole in her side caused the lower decks to flood at an alarming rate to the crew.|$|R
50|$|This {{structure}} proved ill-placed, and a {{more substantial}} building was erected beginning in 1873, consisting of a brick house with an attached tower, about 100 ft tall, in which was mounted a third order Fresnel lens. This light went into service on December 7, 1874. In 1890 a steam <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> was added, and in 1893 a circular oil house was built.|$|E
5000|$|Point Wilson's first {{lighthouse}} {{was built}} in 1879 by the United States Lighthouse Service as a companion to the Admiralty Head Light built some 18 years earlier {{on the eastern side}} of Admiralty Inlet. A square wooden tower projecting from the roof of a two-story, Cape Cod-style keeper’s quarters held a fixed fourth-order Fresnel lens. The station also included a fog signal building with 12-inch, steam-powered <b>fog</b> <b>whistle.</b>|$|E
50|$|After {{continuing}} the voyage {{for several hours}} a dense fog bank was suddenly encountered at around 7 o'clock. The engines were stopped but almost immediately afterwards a <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> was heard. The steamship Seine emerged through the fog and within seconds struck Egypts port side in the English Channel 28 nmi km off the Armen Lighthouse, Finistère, France. Seine had a strengthened bow for ice-breaking, which penetrated deeply into Egypt′s hull before the ships drifted apart.|$|E
6000|$|... 'JULY 13. - All {{yesterday}} we {{lay in the}} damp dripping <b>fog,</b> with <b>whistles</b> all round and guns firing so that we might not bump up against one another. This little delay has let us get our reports into tolerable order. We are now at 7 o'clock getting the cable end again, with the main cable buoy close to us.' ...|$|R
5000|$|The late 1890s {{reconstruction}} of the ship canal resulted in the replacement of this tower and the fog signal house with a single brick lighthouse containing both signals. This house, constructed of Cream City brick, was completed in 1901, and the new tower was first lit on September 1 of that year. This tower stood on {{the southeast corner of}} the rectangular building, and housed the lens retained from the old light; the <b>fog</b> <b>whistles</b> and their reflector were also moved from the old structure to the new. The latter were replaced in 1915 with locomotive whistles, and in 1921 with Type F diaphones, setting off another round of noise complaints, which led to the installation of a new sound reflector. The diaphones were replaced in 1968 with an electronic horn, but in 1976 a group styling itself TOOT (for [...] "reTurn Our Old Tone") began a campaign to restore the fog signal. Horns from the Kewaunee Pierhead Light were obtained, and in 1995 the diaphones were put back in service, eliciting, of course, a new round of noise complaints, which led to restriction of the signal to daytime operation. The signal required a three-phase current supply for operation, and when this failed in 2005, the Coast Guard refused to pay for repairs; legal concerns led the city to refuse to pick up the tab, and the signal was dismantled the following year. The light, however, continues in service, displaying a fixed green light.|$|R

50|$|The {{light was}} {{situated}} in a sandy area towards {{the tip of the}} northern spit; the intent was for the light to serve both as a marker for the entrance and as a warning for the spit. It was immediately discovered that the low-lying site was vulnerable to the waves, and by 1867 the Lighthouse Board was already making plans to relocate the light to a new site {{on the south side of}} the entrance. In the meantime a log breakwater was placed around the light. Fog was a major problem, and a steam <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> was installed in 1874.|$|E
50|$|In 1791 {{the first}} {{lighthouse}} was {{built at the}} entrance to Saint John on Partridge Island, New Brunswick. Six years earlier, the first immigration quarantine station in Canada had been established there. The other major quarantine station, at Grosse Ile, Quebec, was built as a hasty response to the cholera epidemic of 1832. In that same year, the original lighthouse at Partridge Island was destroyed by fire. In 1859 the second lighthouse was equipped with the first steam-powered <b>fog</b> <b>whistle,</b> an invention of Robert Foulis. The third Partridge Island lighthouse was operational from 1880 until it was replaced by a concrete octagonal tower in 1959.|$|E
50|$|Three light {{structures}} {{have been}} built on this site. The original 35 ft tower, built in 1810, was destroyed by a hurricane in 1815. It was replaced in 1816, by another 35-foot stone tower with a revolving light and ten lamps. The present octagonal granite tower was built in 1856. The upper half of the tower is painted brown and the lower half white to make the light structure a more effective daymark for maritime traffic. In 1871, ship captains asked that Point Judith's fog signal be changed from a horn to whistle. This change distinguished the Point Judith light from the Beavertail Lighthouse, which used a siren to announce <b>fog.</b> A <b>whistle</b> could also be heard more distinctly over {{the sounds of the}} surf in the area. Point Judith Light was automated in 1954, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988.|$|R
50|$|In 1901 the {{lighthouse}} board {{decided that a}} manned light was required, and in 1903 obtained a $75,000 appropriation. Construction was protracted: the crib and concrete pier foundation were not completed until 1905. Atop this was erected a three story octagonal brick house with a tower in the center to hold a fourth order Fresnel lens. The original steam <b>whistle</b> <b>fog</b> signal was replaced with diaphone foghorns in the mid-1920s. The new tower was placed at {{the eastern edge of}} the reef, and upon its activation the old beacon was abandoned.|$|R
50|$|In 1880 {{the light}} keeper erected a fence around {{the station in}} order to reduce {{drifting}} snow and sand, which were making access to the property difficult at times; this was supplemented in 1892 with a network of wooden walkways joining the various station buildings. More substantial changes commenced in 1895 {{with the addition of a}} steam <b>whistle</b> <b>fog</b> signal, which was replaced in 1929 with a diaphone horn; at the same time the beacon was converted from kerosene to electricity. A wooden house was erected for an assistant keeper in 1898; this was replaced by a red brick duplex in 1910.|$|R
50|$|In 1867, it was {{determined}} a new tower needed to be built and the new structure was completed in 1868. The new lighthouse was a keeper's quarters with an attached lantern on the roof.

50|$|On July 21, 1907, San Pedro left on {{a routine}} trip between Eureka, California and San Pedro, California under the {{leadership}} of Captain Magnus Hanson. She was carrying over 390000 ft of Redwood lumber in her hold along with a large load of railroad ties and fence posts on her deck. Later that night, she became enshrouded in fog off Shelter Cove, California. Captain Hanson retired and left First Officer Ben Hendrickson in charge. Despite the fog, she continued sailing at full steam. Upon hearing a <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> from a nearby steamship, Hendrickson immediately changed the San Pedro's course to head out to sea in order to avoid a possible collision. The steamer's whistle grew louder as the San Pedro continued heading out to sea.|$|E

5000|$|In 1874 a steam-powered <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> {{was built}} at Long Eddy Point, a tree-covered cliff at the {{northern}} end of Grand Manan. It began operation on 1 July 1874. It was built half-way up the cliff overlooking the Bay of Fundy, 80 ft above the high water mark. It emitted 3 blasts, four seconds long, every minute. The station's infrastructure included a keeper's house, a coal shed, storage tanks for the water used to generate the steam for the whistle, and a wharf {{at the bottom of the}} cliff for delivering supplies to the keeper. Coal was brought from the top of the cliff by a wooden chute 80 ft long. In 1893 and 1897 wooden abutments were built to protect the station from falling rocks and other material.|$|E
5000|$|The Sambro {{lighthouse}} {{was built}} during the Seven Years' War {{by the very}} first act passed by Nova Scotia's House of Assembly on October 2, 1758 which placed a tax on incoming vessels and alcohol imports {{to pay for the}} lighthouse. An earlier attempt by the colonial officials in 1752 to finance the lighthouse with a lottery was unsuccessful. With funding secured by the Assembly, construction began in the fall of 1758. Masonry work was completed by November 3, 1758 and a temporary light was first lit while construction continued. Construction was completed in 1759 and Joseph Rous (son of Captain John Rous) was appointed as the first keeper.The lighthouse was first automated on 1988. Cannons were used to provide fog warnings beginning in the late 18th century until the 1870s when a steam <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> was installed.|$|E
50|$|Several {{advances}} in the technology of fog signals were made during the 1850s. In 1851, an experimental air <b>fog</b> <b>whistle</b> and reed horn was installed at Beavertail Lighthouse {{at the entrance to}} Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. At first this sound signal was powered by a horse-operated treadmill and later by an internal combustion steam engine. Around 1851, mechanically rung fog bells were introduced. The striking mechanism was governed by a weight attached to a flywheel, and later internally run by clockworks. The strokes of the fog signals were timed deliberately to afford each signal a unique sound characteristic. The bell signal was gradually replaced by three variations of that instrument. The first was an ordinary locomotive whistle, enlarged and modified and blown by steam from a high-pressured tubular boiler. The second was a reed-trumpet, and in 1866 the third variation, a siren-trumpet. Although the fog bell signal was still used for warning vessels over short distances, other fog signals started to supersede the smaller bell signal. Bells were also used on buoys; later whistling buoys were invented by J. M. Courtenay and were first in use in 1876. The first gas-lighted buoy was installed in 1882. The gong buoy was invented in 1923.|$|E
