Three rows of children can be seen, showing the younger students seated {{in the front row}} and the older ones standing in the middle and back row. The two adult teachers are visible in the back row; directly behind them, a partially visible side of a house (building?) serves as the background.

50|$|Eve, the Serpent and Death (or Eve, the Serpent, and Adam as Death) is a {{painting}} by the German Renaissance artist Hans Baldung, housed in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa. The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>picture</b> is debated, with proposals ranging from the early 1510s to between 1525 and 1530. Its four main elements are the biblical Eve, a male figure personifying death and generally likened to Adam, a serpent, and a tree trunk.|$|R

50|$|Charles II was {{the last}} Habsburg to reign in Spain, and was born with {{physical}} and mental disabilities, and he relied on caregivers throughout his life.

It was in this work, for the first time, he was depicted in military garments, the military background of the portrait references the wars with Louis XIV of France. The symbols drawn in the armor are those belonging to the one used by Felipe II in the Battle of San Quintin in the year 1557.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how competition in product niches affects the ultimate timing of product release for experience goods using data on motion {{pictures in the}} United States. We identify product niches that movies occupy along three different product dimensions: common actor, common director, and common genre. We estimate the drivers for a motion picture's weekly sales based on the variation {{in the level of}} competition in these particular niches over time. We show that release <b>date</b> <b>of</b> motion <b>pictures</b> are more likely rescheduled when there is more competition during the initially proposed release week. Next, we find that competition from movies by the same director or within the same movie genre decrease motion picture's box office revenue most. Finally, we compare a movie's actual sales to estimated sales at the originally planned release date. Rescheduled movies generate about $ 6 million more revenue than they would have at their originally proposed release date...|$|R
5000|$|The late James Beck, Professor of Art History at Columbia University in New York, {{believed}} that Duccio's Madonna and Child, which the Met dates to 1300, {{is the work}} of a 19th-century artist or forger based on stylistic grounds. He pointed to what he considers to be the low quality of the painting and elements of content that he claims had not yet appeared in artwork of that period. Professor Beck said: [...] "We are asked to believe that the modest little picture represents a leap into the future of Western painting by establishing a plane in front of Mary and the Child. This feature, a characteristic of Renaissance not Medieval pictures, occurs only a hundred years after the presumptive <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>picture</b> ...". Beck's conclusions were published in 2007 in his book, From Duccio to Raphael: Connoisseurship in Crisis in which he also disputes the attribution of the National Gallery of London's painting Madonna of the Pinks to Raphael.|$|R

30|$|Regarding the {{subcontracting}} {{activities of}} formal enterprises, the only available empirical evidence representative {{of all of}} Indian manufacturing is a study by Ramaswamy ([1999]), documenting an increase in subcontracting intensity of formal sector production between 1970 and the early 1990 s. In the early 1990 s, subcontracting was used most in labor-intensive industries and in industries with the highest average employment per factory.

A similar subject is represented in the celebrated Alexander Mosaic found in the House of the Faun, Pompeii. As the disciple of Nicomachus, who flourished about 360 BC, and as the painter of the battle of Issus (333 BC), Philoxenus must have flourished in the age of Alexander, about 330 BC and onwards.

The climate of the south coast of Pernambuco has characteristics like high humidity and high temperatures. Due to wet soils and presence of mangrove vegetation, this area tends to have low values of surface albedo. This study aims to correlate Water Balance with the Surface Albedo values, using as analysis support the moisture content NDWI. To this end, it was obtained water balances for prior periods to images for {{a better understanding of the}} behavior of surface albedo. Letters of Albedo and NDWI were generated from the TM sensor images from satellite Landsat TM 5, however, has been before submitted to the geometric correction using the first-order polynomial interpolation for subsequent computations of radiance, reflectance, planetary albedo, surface albedo and NDWI. The surface albedo varied according to rainfall that occurred days before the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>picture,</b> because it shows lower values due to the presence of water. The water balance showed a strong correlation with the surface albedo. The correlation between surface albedo and water balance was satisfactory in the area with the presence of mangrove vegetation.
