5|$|Alkaline {{digestion}} {{is carried}} out in 30–45% sodium hydroxide solution at about 140°C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads {{to the formation of}} poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the <b>filtrate,</b> and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as sodium diuranate, and phosphate as trisodium phosphate. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60°C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of silicon dioxide in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are then dissolved at 80°C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as then air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can then liberate free chlorine from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are then neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. Solvent extraction may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of titanium hydroxide is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.|$|E
5|$|Rhabdomyolysis {{may cause}} kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most {{important}} is the accumulation of myoglobin in the kidney tubules. Normally, the blood protein haptoglobin binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. Myoglobinuria, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in plasma exceeds 0.5–1.5mg/dl; once plasma levels reach 100mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient {{for it to be}} visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the , myoglobin interacts with Tamm–Horsfall protein in the nephron to form casts (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the <b>filtrate,</b> which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to constriction of the blood vessels and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to acute tubular necrosis, the destruction of the cells of tubules. Glomerular filtration rate falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with vitamin D processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.|$|E

Culture <b>filtrates</b> from T-flavus grown on both media contained complex protein profiles. However, only culture <b>filtrates</b> from T. flavus grown on glucose inhibited germination of microsclerotia of Verticillium dahliae in in vitro inhibition assays. A polyclonal antiserum preparation, pABGO- 1, raised against purified glucose oxidase from T. flavus was highly specific for glucose oxidase. Only one protein band in culture <b>filtrates</b> (from glucose medium), migrating at 71 kDa, was detected in Western blots (immunoblots) with this antiserum. This band comigrated with purified glucose oxidase. No bands were detected in culture <b>filtrates</b> from the xylan medium. Glucose oxidase was removed via immunoprecipitation from culture <b>filtrates</b> of T. flavus grown in glucose medium, resulting in <b>filtrates</b> which no longer inhibited in vitro microsclerotial germination. When glucose oxidase-depleted <b>filtrates</b> were amended with purified glucose oxidase from T. flavus, the ability to kill microsclerotia in vitro was restored to original levels. We conclude that glucose oxidase is the only protein in culture <b>filtrates</b> of T. flavus responsible for inhibition of germination of microsclerotia of V. dahliae...|$|R
30|$|The {{obtained}} API <b>filtrates</b> loss volumes for the mud {{systems are}} relatively moderate for drilling operation. Low <b>filtrates</b> volume by improving the mud composition, deposition and {{thickness of the}} filter cake {{is one of the}} requirements of drilling muds. Conventional <b>filtrates</b> loss additives, such as partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PHPA), carboxyl methyl cellulose (CMC) and PAC are in macro-sizes and cannot seal the nanopore throat of the wall of the wellbore effectively (Gbadamosi et al. 2018 a). The <b>filtrates</b> volume of the mud systems was controlled by using PAC. After thermal aging the mud systems at 150  °F for 16  h, the HPHT <b>filtrates</b> volume of BWBM was increased to 13.8  ml by 94.4 % as compared to 9.2  ml by 70.4 % of HWBM (Fig.  13). Temperature has direct effect on filtration properties. Higher temperature gives the mud lower viscosities, and subsequently higher filtration properties.

25|$|Where Q0 = {{mass flow}} rate (kg/s), m0 = mass loading (kg/m2), sb = belt speed (m/s) and Lsludge0 = initial width of sludge across the belt (m). Thus to {{maintain}} industrial scale economic throughput at lower belt speed, the mass loading and width of sludge across the belt must be increased. It {{has been found that}} increasing the solids loading slightly decreases the dry solids concentration of the cake while significantly increasing the potential for sludge to overflow the belt. Lateral migration of sludge on the belt is a measure of how the sludge spreads across the width of the belt. Increased lateral sludge migration means that sludge is escaping the edge of the belt and overflowing into the <b>filtrate.</b> Therefore, increased lateral sludge migration negatively impacts <b>filtrate</b> quality and dry solids recovery.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} belt is {{critical}} to the function of the belt press filter and a wide variety of materials and weaves are available. The filter cloth for a belt press filter should be as open as possible while maintaining the desired <b>filtrate</b> clarity or, if precoat is used, to prevent the loss of precoat. Lighter cloths produce a clearer <b>filtrate</b> and do not block as rapidly however their durability and life span is significantly shorter than heavier cloths. Both seamless and seamed belts are available. Seamed belts wear faster at the seam and cause wear at the rollers and the doctor blade. Zipper-type and clipper-type seamed belts are also available with the zipper-type having a longer life span as they provide less discontinuity. Seamless belts have the longest life span but are more expensive. Also it should be ensured that the belt press is compatible with a seamless belt.|$|E
30|$|The API and HPHT <b>filtrates</b> loss {{volume of}} BWBM and HWBM systems {{are shown in}} Fig.  13. From Fig.  13, the API <b>filtrates</b> volume of BWBM was 7.1  ml, while that of HWBM was 5.4  ml, {{indicating}} that the BWBM has higher <b>filtrates</b> loss tendencies into the permeable formation than the HWBM. The relatively higher loss of <b>filtrates</b> volume in BWBM in comparison with HWBM {{is an indication that}} KCl presence needed for clay hydration inhibition induced high clay flocculation more than in HWBM leading to higher <b>filtrates</b> loss volume of BWBM (Zhong et al. 2011). Besides, TGA result showed that HLE can enhance the heat tolerance of the drilling mud system better than bentonite particles. The <b>filtrates</b> loss volume of conventional WBM is dependent on the performance of the drilling fluid properties, in particular the plastic viscosity.|$|R

METHODS: Broth culture <b>filtrates</b> of H pylori were prepared. Gastric epithelial cells were treated with the <b>filtrates,</b> and cell growth was determined by growth curve and flow cytometry. DNA damage of gastric epithelial cells was measured by single-cell microgel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Gastric epithelial cells proliferated actively when treated by CagA-gene-positive broth culture <b>filtrates,</b> and colony formation reached 40 %. The number of cells in S phase increased compared to controls. Comet assay showed 41. 2 % comet cells in GES- 1 cells treated with CagA-positive <b>filtrates</b> (P < 0. 05).
