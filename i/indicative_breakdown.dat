The polysaccharide polymer served as a floc-forming agent for the suspensions when both the polymeric concentration and solids loading exceeded critical levels. As phi {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 03 at polysaccharide concentration 0. 5 wt. %, the particles formed clusters in liquid, resulting in increased settling velocities at initial stage of settling. Collective settling of the particles followed the cluster deposition, in compliance with the formation of a continuous gelled suspension structure as phi was further increased. Strength of the gelled network eventually prevailed over gravity force imposed on the network as phi was increased towards a critical concentration (phi(c)) at which the network ceased to settle. This phi(c) appeared to decrease from 0. 1 to 0. 03 as the polysaccharide concentration was increased from 0. 5 to 2 wt. %. The suspensions showed shear-thinning flow character at low shear rate range (gamma = 1 to similar to 100 s(- 1)), <b>indicative</b> of <b>breakdown</b> of the particle clusters into smaller flow units as shear rate was increased; whilst, the suspensions then changed toward shear thickening as shear rate was further increased (gamma greater than or similar to 100 s(- 1)).

Triode plasma nitriding was {{used in conjunction with}} electron-beam plasma-assisted physical vapour deposition of TiN and CrAlN to enhance the wear resistance of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V titanium alloy. Linear reciprocating-sliding ball-on-plate wear tests were performed to assess the tribological performance of the treated alloy. Wear volumes were correlated to changes in coefficient of friction, which is often <b>indicative</b> of <b>breakdown</b> of the surface treatment. Debris generated during wear testing was charac- terised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and laser diffraction for particle size analysis. Surface micro-profilometry and SEM were used to characterise the wear scars. The results obtained indicate that, in order to assess the rela- tive improvement in wear behaviour attained by using surface treatments it is insufficient to compare linear wear rates alone. A clear comparison is only possible if testing is carried out in steps of increasing sliding distance, until the treated/deposited layers have been completely removed. Also, it is shown that the number of repeated tests necessary to evaluate clearly the treatment and/or coating can vary sub- stantially, depending on the observed test progression; typically this necessitates the greatest number of repeats around the point of wear at which the ball counterface contact area is in transition from the treatment layer(s) to the substrate bulk. The inherent variability in wear performance under linear ball- on-plate reciprocating-sliding is correlated to debris generation, changes in relative humidity – and the resultant wear mechanisms involved. peer-reviewe...|$|R

In general, geologic evidence supports the hypothesis of a megamonsoon that reached maximum strength in the Triassic. Pangea in the Late Carboniferous had widespread peat formation in what is now central and eastern North America and Europe and relatively dry conditions on the Colorado Plateau. The equatorial region of the continent became drier {{through the end of the}} Carboniferous. By the Permian, the equatorial region of Pangea was dry, and indicators of aridity and rainfall seasonality became more widespread. Wind directions from Colorado Plateau eolian sandstones are consistent with an increasing influence of monsoonal circulation at this time. In the Triassic, climate in the Colorado Plateau region became relatively wet, though still seasonal, and the few eolian sandstones indicate a major shift in wind direction at that time. In addition, sedimentation in Australia, which was in relatively high latitudes, took on a much drier and more seasonal character. These two events support the hypothesis that the Pangean monsoon was at maximum strength during the Triassic. In the Early Jurassic, the Colorado Plateau region became arid again, but climate apparently became wetter in eastern Laurussia and Gondwana.

The effect of the non-localized surface roughness geometry and acoustic wave amplitude on the receptivity process was explored. The surface roughness had a well defined wavenumber spectrum with fundamental wavenumber k (sub w). A planar downstream traveling acoustic wave was created to temporally excite the flow near the resonance frequency of an unstable eigenmode corresponding to k (sub ts) = k (sub w). The range of acoustic forcing levels, epsilon, and roughness heights, DELTA h, examined resulted in a linear dependence of receptivity coefficients; however, the larger values of the forcing combination epsilon dot DELTA h resulted in subsequent nonlinear development of the Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) wave. This study provided the first experimental evidence of a marked increase in the receptivity coefficient with increasing obliqueness of the surface waviness in excellent agreement with theory. Detuning of the 2 -D and oblique disturbances was investigated by varying the streamwise wall-roughness wavenumber a,, and measuring the T-S response.

Subjects and methods. Thirty-eight patients with hypo-kinetic circulation, who had undergone sublobar resections, lobectomies, and pneumonectomies, were examined. The values of hemodynamics and gas exchange were recorded at the basic surgical stages {{and in the early}} postoperative period (on days 1, 3, 7, and 10). Results. When the patient is placed in the lateral position, the lung is switched off, or the surgical pneumothorax is less than 10 — 12 %, cardiac index changes generally fail to give rise to the decompensation of adaptive processes in the cardiovascular system if the volume of a surgical intervention does not exceed that of sublobar resections or lobectomies. A 15 % or more change in cardiac index during controlled lung collapse even with the minimum volume of surgery is <b>indicative</b> of the <b>breakdown</b> of physiological adaptation processes and may manifest itself through the symptoms of cardiorespiratory decompensation in both intra- and postoperative periods.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the relationship between plasma ghrelin levels and IR in Saudi subjects with T 2 DM. MethodsPatients with T 2 DM (n= 107, cases) and non-diabetic apparently healthy subjects (n= 101, controls) from Saudi Arabia were included in this study. The biochemical profiles and plasma insulin levels of all subjects were analyzed, and IR was estimated using the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. Active ghrelin levels in plasma were measured using the radioimmunoassay technique. ResultsOnly 46. 7 % (50 of 107) of the T 2 DM subjects had IR, including 26 % (28 of 107) with severe IR (HOMA-IR ≥ 5), while 5. 9 % (six of 101) of the controls had moderate IR (3 ≤HOMA-IR < 5). HOMA-IR values were not associated with age, disease duration, or gender. Importantly, T 2 DM itself and the co-occurrence of IR with T 2 DM were significantly associated with low plasma ghrelin levels. However, ghrelin levels were inversely correlated with the HOMA-IR index, body weight, and fasting plasma insulin levels, mainly in the control subjects, which was <b>indicative</b> of the <b>breakdown</b> of metabolic homeostasis in T 2 DM.

Thus, we compared the incubation versus microinjection of the neutral Bacillus cereus sphingomyelinase (bSMase) to examine whether the topology of ceramide generation determines its effects {{on the fate of}} oocytes. In agreement with previous findings, incubation of mature stage VI oocytes with bSMase increased ceramide levels in oocyte extracts over time, causing the germinal vesicle <b>breakdown</b> <b>indicative</b> of maturation, without evidence of cytotoxicity. In contrast, bSMase microinjection, which increased ceramide levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner, resulted in oocyte apoptosis characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, reduced glutathione (GSH) depletion in cytosol and mitochondria, release of cytochrome c and Smac/Diablo from mitochondria, and caspase- 3 activation. Microinjection of acidic SMase from human placenta recapitulated the apoptotic effects of bSMase microinjection. Preincubation of oocytes with GSH-ethyl ester before bSMase microinjection prevented ROS generation and mitochondrial downstream events, thus protecting oocytes from bSMase-induced death.

Surgical exploration yielded similar findings of a cyst containing free-flowing, brown watery fluid. Histologically, an inflammatory re-sponse was present {{as well as a}} variable number of cholesterol crystals. There was little identifiable capsular tissue but abundant evidence of subacute or chronic hema-toma.

40|$|Neuropsychological {{research}} suggests that recognition memory (RM) and recall memory are impaired in patients with a major depressive disorder or a dysphoric mood state. This study examines the proposal that abnormalities in recollection (a form of recall) result from a breakdown in frontal strategic memory processes involved in encoding and retrieval, and executive functions linked to reality monitoring, planning, problem-solving, reasoning and decision-making. We investigated two predictions arising from this theory. Firstly, patients diagnosed with a major depressive disorder (MDD) will display a dissociation between (deficient) recollection and (preserved) familiarity. Secondly, if recollection impairments are <b>indicative</b> of a <b>breakdown</b> in prefrontal strategic memory processes which are dependent, at least in part, on executive processes, then an explicit correlational approach predicts that recollection will be positively associated with the severity of executive dysfunction in MDD patients. The remember/know paradigm was used to investigate RM for words and neutral faces in 16 MDD patients and 16 healthy volunteers, matched for age, gender and estimates of premorbid IQ. Measures of executive function included working memory, reasoning and decision-making. Applying the Dual Process Signal Detection interpretation of the remember/know data, the MDD group displayed significant impairments in RM and recollection rates for both verbal and neutral facial memoranda. In contrast, familiarity-aware rates were preserved. There {{was no evidence of}} executive dysfunction in the patient group, and little evidence that recollection rates correlated with executive function. Furthermore, a single process signal detection approach suggested that the MDD patients displayed a reduction in sensitivity for RM and remember rates but not know responses. The criteria for detecting studied from unstudied items, and remembering from knowing, were the same in both patient and healthy control groups. Taken together, {{these findings are consistent with}} the view that MDD is marked by a decline in RM, which is underpinned by an impairment in recollection rather than familiarity processes.

Also, unlike Hepatitis A in which the sufferer almost always recovers completely, or rarely dies, both Hepatitis B and C give rise to chronic carrier state and indolent disease in many. At present, Hepatitis C is the commonest reason for liver transplantation in the US while HIV is currently incurable although its clinical course can be modified. In any case, between them, they have changed awareness of infectious disease in sports, and certainly changed management on the playing surface. Ironically, evidence for transmission of any of the three as a result of injury and/or contact on the playing surface is exceedingly limited and the greatest risk to the athlete surrounds behavior that may take place off court. A case report in 1982 described 5 of 10 members of a Japanese high school sumo wrestling club who contracted hepatitis. It was hypothesized that spread had occurred through skin cuts and abrasions. An outbreak of HBV in an American football team was reported in 2000. Eleven of 65 athletes were found to be HBV positive in a 19-month surveillance period. Contact with open wounds of an HBV carrier was again hypothesized. Interestingly, both of those case reports originated in Japan. HBV transmission has been estimated to be 50 to 100 times more likely than the risk of transmission of HIV. HBV is also more environmentally stable, is resistant to alcohol and some detergents, and to be capable of surviving on environmental surfaces for more than seven days.

The results indicate that older adults experienced more interference and facilitation than the younger adults and produced more errors than the younger adults on items where {{the meaning of the word}} and the color of the item did not match. Likewise, the process dissociation measures showed higher word estimates for older adults. Altogether these findings are <b>indicative</b> of a <b>breakdown</b> in older adults 2 ̆ 7 inhibitory processes. The second study examined the effects of practice on older and younger adults 2 ̆ 7 ability to inhibit word reading in the Stroop. Twelve younger and 12 older adults were assigned to each of two list conditions. Participants in the mostly congruent list condition received 140 items, 100 of which were congruent, 20 of which were incongruent and 20 of which were control. Participants in the mostly incongruent condition also received 140 trials, 100 of which where incongruent, 20 of which were congruent and 20 of which were control. The mostly incongruent list thus provided more practice in ignoring word meaning. Once again Stroop facilitation and interference scores, error rates, and process dissociation measures were computed. The results indicated that the mostly congruent list produced more facilitation and interference than the mostly incongruent list and that older adults again had higher facilitation and interference scores than younger adults. However, there was no evidence in the latency data that older adults benefitted less from practice than their younger counterparts. The process dissociation estimates demonstrated that older adults had higher word process estimates than the younger participants but that their color process estimates were similar to those of the younger adults. In addition, the mostly incongruent list produced lower word estimates and higher color estimates than the mostly congruent list. Moreover, this pattern did not differ across list types from that of the younger adults, again suggesting a similar benefit from practice for the two age groups. Taken together, these two studies suggest that while older adults are poorer at inhibitory skills, they do benefit from practice...|$|R

The western grey kangaroo, Macropus fuliginosus {{is one of the}} largest species of extant macropod and is distributed across most of southern Australia. However, existing research is limited to ecological and captive studies and major gaps in our knowledge remain. In this study, variation at autosomal and Y-chromosome microsatellite loci, as well as the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was assessed in M. fuliginosus populations throughout the transcontinental distribution to elucidate aspects of contemporary structure, phylogeography and hybridisation. Overall diversity in M. fuliginosus was among the highest recorded in marsupials at both autosomal microsatellites and mtDNA, although Kangaroo Island was a notable exception. In contrast, Y-chromosome microsatellites showed less diversity, potentially associated with the skewed sex ratio and polygynous mating system. Five genetically distinct units, some associated with landscape discontinuities, were apparent within M. fuliginosus. Of these, the Lake Torrens/Flinders Ranges area represents the most substantial filter, with populations on either side displaying little admixture and reduced male gene flow. Overall high levels of dispersal were evident, with a strong male bias in effective migration rates. The absence of isolation by distance in the east of the range appears associated with the recent eastward expansion or the influence of environmental/ landscape variables on dispersal. Climatic fluctuations during the Pleistocene have influenced the genetic structure of M. fuliginosus, with the temporary historic isolation of north and south-western populations and subsequent eastward expansion into the current distribution, from south-western Australian populations, prior to the last glacial maxima. Colonised during the easterly expansion, the Kangaroo Island population appears to display differing maternal and paternal lineages. M. fuliginosus represents a single evolutionary significant unit comprised of several management units some of which relate to morphological and reproductive variants. Kangaroo Island represents a reproductive and morphological variant resulting from 9, 500 years of isolation and drift, rather than a major component of the genetic diversity. Where M. fuliginosus occurs sympatrically with Macropus giganteus two-way introgression was apparent but no Fl hybrids were detected. This level of hybridisation is <b>indicative</b> of occasional <b>breakdowns</b> in reproductive isolation rather than an active contact zone.
