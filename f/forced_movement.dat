500|$|On 10 October 1941, Heydrich was {{the senior}} officer at a [...] "Final Solution" [...] {{meeting of the}} RSHA in Prague that {{discussed}} deporting 50,000 Jews from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to ghettos in Minsk and Riga. Given his position, Heydrich was instrumental in carrying out these plans since his Gestapo was ready to organise deportations in the West and his Einsatzgruppen were already conducting extensive killing operations in the East. The officers attending also discussed taking 5,000 Jews from Prague [...] "in the next few weeks" [...] and handing {{them over to the}} Einsatzgruppen commanders Arthur Nebe and Otto Rasch. Establishing ghettos in the Protectorate was also planned, resulting in the construction of Theresienstadt, where 33,000 people would eventually die. Tens of thousands more passed through the camp on their way to their deaths in the East. In 1941 Himmler named Heydrich as [...] "responsible for implementing" [...] the <b>forced</b> <b>movement</b> of 60,000 Jews from Germany and Czechoslovakia to the Lodz (Litzmannstadt) Ghetto in Poland.|$|E
2500|$|The Somalia Affair came as such as {{surprise}} to the Canadian public as {{no one would have}} thought Canada’s golden reputation for international peacekeeping could be tarnished. The Somalia Affair and the ensuing commission of inquiry has become the subject of intense criticism and has given rise to a great deal of comparative theoretical work on humanitarian intervention and peacekeeping. In her book Sherene Razack asks if it was just a case of ‘a few bad apples’ in the Canadian forces, or if the Somalia Affair speaks to a larger issue on the complex nature of peacekeeping and humanitarian intervention. Thomas Weiss comments that the failures in Somalia have led to this concept of ‘Somalia Syndrome’: “multilateral interventions to thwart starvation, genocide, the <b>forced</b> <b>movement</b> of peoples, and massive violations of fundamental rights are no longer politically or operationally feasible”. Peacekeepers {{are more likely to be}} involved in peace enforcement in more warlike conditions as unlike traditional peacekeeping; there is not always consent from all the conflicting parties. Such was the case in Somalia as the men were hypervigilent with a sense of fear and frustration as they were trained for combat yet charged with providing humanitarian aid. Faced with this strong Somali opposition and resentment and yet being responsible for providing aid meant that Canadian peacekeepers “increasingly could not find meaning in their activities” [...] There would be a ‘Somalia syndrome’ sentiment that would linger in the international community after the failures in the war torn country. Weiss, however, reminds us not to take Somalia out of context or draw upon the wrong lessons leading to isolationism or eschewing necessary humanitarian intervention. The debacle in Somalia would be so paralyzing that it would lead to an unwillingness from the international community to respond to future problems, like the Rwandan Genocide. The United States under the Clinton Administration would need to rethink its foreign policies and the rest of the world just did not want another Somalia Affair.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia {{under the}} Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence. About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at Choeung Ek, which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the Killing Fields. The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy. People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made homo sacer in a condition of bare life. The Killing Fields—manifestations of Agamben's concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law—featured the state of exception. As part of Pol Pot's [...] "ideological intent…to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative", he [...] "dismantled the country's existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area". <b>Forced</b> <b>movement,</b> such as this <b>forced</b> <b>movement</b> applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence. When [...] "symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind…were purged or torn down", cultural violence (defined as when [...] "any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence") is added to the structural violence of <b>forced</b> <b>movement</b> and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields. Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended. However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia.|$|E

50|$|The bourgeoisie may {{be further}} {{subdivided}} {{into the very}} wealthy bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. The petty bourgeoisie are those who employ labor, but may also work themselves.

Marx also identified the lumpenproletariat, a stratum of society completely disconnected from the means of production.|$|E
5000|$|In the 6th century, John Philoponus partly {{accepted}} Aristotle's {{theory that}} [...] "continuation of motion depends on continued action of a force," [...] but modified it to include his {{idea that the}} hurled body acquires a motive power or inclination for <b>forced</b> <b>movement</b> from the agent producing the initial motion and that this power secures the continuation of such motion.
