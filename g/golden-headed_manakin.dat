2500|$|Since 1995, the zoo {{has been}} a part of the red wolf Species Survival Plan and {{reintroduction}} program. [...] The zoo has been home to 48 of these critically endangered animals, including a litter of 5, born at the zoo in 2002, which became the first captive-bred wolves to be adopted by wild parents. [...] The zoo is also involved in the gorilla Species Survival Plan and received two female gorillas in early 2010 as part of the effort. As a result of their successful breeding, two male gorillas (Bomassa and Apollo) were born in August 2012. The Aviary is also known for a number of high-profile hatchings, including the first US hatchings of the golden white-eye, the red-faced liocichla, the African pied barbet, the <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakin,</b> the horned puffin, the parakeet auklet and the thick-billed murre as well as the second US hatchings of the African grey-headed kingfisher and the African spoonbill.|$|E
50|$|Like other manakins, the <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakin</b> is a compact, brightly {{coloured}} forest bird, typically 3.7 in (9.4 cm) {{long and}} weighing 0.44 oz (12.5 g). The adult male is black {{apart from a}} golden cap, white and red thighs, pink legs and a yellowish bill. The female and young males are olive-green and resemble female white-bearded manakins, but are smaller, shorter-tailed and have pinkish (not bright orange) legs. Apart from the buzzing display song (see below), the <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakin</b> {{has a number of}} other calls, including a buzzing pir pir prrrrrt.|$|E
5000|$|The {{placement}} is disputed among taxonomists, {{with some}} including it in Pipra and others {{placing it in}} its own genus, Ceratopipra.) [...] It is closely related to, and in eastern Panama sometimes hybridizes with, the <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{female and}} young males are olive-green and {{resemble}} female <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakins,</b> {{but they have}} orange legs. The race endemic to Trinidad, M. m. trinitatis is larger than mainland birds, and the female has yellower underparts. Apart from the buzzing display song, the white-bearded manakin {{has a number of}} other calls, including a trilled musical peeerr.|$|R

Animals in this exhibit include Arrau River turtles, bay-headed tanagers, black pacu, {{turquoise}} honeycreepers, emerald tree boas, <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakins,</b> leafcutter ants, mata matas, paradise tanagers, peacock bass, red-capped cardinals, red-tailed catfish, rufous-crowned tanagers, silver-beaked tanagers, stingrays, sunbitterns, swallow tanagers, turquoise tanagers, violaceous euphonia, yellow-rumped cacique, yellow-spotted Amazon river turtles, green anaconda, and saffron finches.|$|R
50|$|Male <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakins</b> give a {{fascinating}} courtship display at a communal lek. Each male occupies a horizontal perch 20-40 ft (6-12 m) high and rapidly jumps, slides, or darts to other perches. The display {{is accompanied by}} the whirring of the wings and a buzzing zit-zit call. Groups of up to 12 birds may perform together. The female builds a shallow cup nest low in a tree; two brown-mottled yellowish eggs are laid, and incubated entirely by the female for about 16-17 days.|$|R

50|$|In 1958, David married Barbara Kathleen Whitaker, who was {{the warden}} of Lundy Island. Barbara Snow was also a noted ornithologist and a geologist. From 1957 to 1961 the Snows worked for the New York Zoological Society at the society's {{research}} centre in Trinidad. Here they made detailed studies of the oilbirds (Steatornis caripensis) and the fascinating and very complex courtship dances of the white-bearded manakin (Manacus manacus) and the <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakin</b> (Pipra erythrocephala).|$|E
50|$|They {{focussed}} {{for some}} time on the fascinating and very complex courtship dances of the white-bearded manakin (Manacus manacus) and the <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakin</b> (Pipra erythrocephala). They came to realise that tropical fruit-eating birds have abundant food resources, and, therefore, a lot of “spare time” which has facilitated the extraordinary flourishing of communal lek displays by male manakins. He described these in several classic papers, while also working with Barbara on other tropical birds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{white-bearded manakin}} (Manacus manacus) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird which breeds in tropical South America. It is found from Colombia, Venezuela and Trinidad south to Bolivia and northern Argentina. This manakin is found in forests, secondary growth and plantations. It is a small, plump bird about 10.7 cm long. Males have a black crown, upper back, wings and tail and are otherwise white. Females are olive-green and resemble female <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakins.</b> At breeding time, males are involved in lekking behaviour {{on the forest floor}} during which they puff out their neck feathers. This is a fairly common species with a wide range, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of [...] "least concern".|$|R
5000|$|The <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakin</b> (Ceratopipra erythrocephala) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird which breeds {{in tropical}} Central and South America in both wet and dry forests, secondary growth and plantations. It is a small mannakin, about 9.4 cm long. Males are entirely black apart from a golden head, yellow bill, white and red thighs and pink legs. Females and juveniles are olive-green with pink legs. At breeding time, males {{are involved in a}} cooperative lekking behaviour during which they jump, slide and dart from perch to perch.

50|$|The major {{properties}} are the Spring Hill Estate and the adjacent William Beebe Tropical Research Station (also known as Simla), {{which was established}} by the famous naturalist and explorer William Beebe as a tropical research station for the New York Zoological Society. Beebe bought the 'Verdant Vale' estate in 1949 and named it after Simla in India, which he had visited in 1910. Both properties had previously been cacao estates but contained large stands of original rainforest. The owners of the Spring Hill Estate, Newcombe and Asa Wright, hosted many visiting scientists in the 1950s and '60s, including the noted ornithologists David Snow and Barbara Snow, who made detailed studies of the oilbirds and the very complex courtship dances of the white-bearded manakin and the <b>golden-headed</b> <b>manakin.</b>|$|E

50|$|Kanashen {{houses the}} {{headwaters}} of the Essequibo River, Guyana’s principal water source, and encompasses the southern portion of its watershed, which drains the Kassikaityu, Kamoa, Sipu and Chodikar rivers. The main mountains are the Wassarai, Yahore, Komoa and Kaiawakua, with elevations up to about 1200 metres above sea level. Except for its flora, the biology of the Kanashen district is relatively unstudied. Botanically, the area has many species found only in the area and is covered by four general vegetation types, which have remained almost completely intact. The main vegetation types are tall evergreen highland forest and tall/medium evergreen lower montane forest. There are also small areas of tall evergreen flooded riparian forest and lowland shrub savanna. Species such as Manyokinaballi (Geissospermum spp.) and Kakaralli (Eschweilera) are the most common of the 192 species recorded. The area also contains important fauna such as giant river otters (Pteronura brasiliensis), the cock of the rock (Rupicola rupicola), the giant harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and other animals that support the livelihood of the Wais-Wais. Three globally threatened species inhabit the COCA: the Giant Armadillo (Priodontes maximus), one of the Harlequin Toads (Atelopus spumarius) and the Brazilian Tapir (tapirus terrestris). The Giant Anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), jaguars (Panthera onca), labba (Agouti paca), peccary (Tayassu spp.) and forest deer (Mazama spp.) are also known to occur in the area. Results of community-based bird surveys at three sites recorded 117 species, approximately 16% {{of the total number of}} species recorded in Guyana. This number was increased by an additional 100 species identified during a rapid biological assessment study. Some of the birds present in the COCA are the Screaming Piha (Lipaugus vociferans), White-tailed Trogon (Trogon viridis), Painted Parakeet (Pyrrhura picta), <b>Golden-headed</b> <b>Manakin</b> (Pipra erythrocephala), several species of parrots and macaw including the Scarlet (Ara macao), Red Shouldered (Diopsittaca nobilis) and Blue and Yellow (Ara ararauna) Macaws, and species of antbirds (Thamnophilidae) and toucans (Ramphastidae).|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} Habronematidae parasites (order Spirurida) have been {{described}} as occasional parasites of avian species; however, reports on passerines are relatively uncommon. From 2007 to 2008, 11 passerine deaths at The North Carolina Zoological Park in Asheboro, NC, USA, were associated with ventricular habronemiasis, which was determined to be the cause of death or a major contributing factor in 10 of the 11 individuals. The number and species affected were 5 Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea), 2 Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), 2 <b>Golden-headed</b> <b>Manakin</b> (Pipra erythrocephala), 1 Blue-grey Tanager (Thraupis episcopus), and 1 Emerald Starling (Coccycolius iris). Affected animals displayed nonspecific clinical signs or were found dead. The ventricular nematodes were consistent in morphology with Procyrnea sp. Koilin fragmentation with secondary bacterial and fungal infections was the most frequently observed pathologic lesion. Secondary visceral amyloidosis, attributed to chronic inflammation associated with nematodiasis, was present in 4 individuals. An insect intermediate host is suspected but was not identified. Native passerine species within or around the aviary may be serving as sylvatic hosts...|$|E
