John {{followed}} her on the other horse, and noticed with amazement that she sat as straight and steady on her slippery seat as though she were on a <b>hunting</b> <b>saddle,</b> keeping herself from falling by an instinctive balancing of the body which was very curious to notice. When they were well on to the plain they halted to consider their route, and, turning, Jess pointed to the long lines of vultures descending to feast on their would-be murderers. If they went down the river it would lead them to Standerton, and there they would be safe if they could slip into the town, which was garrisoned by English. But then, as they had gathered from the conversation of their escort, Standerton was closely invested by the Boers, and to try and pass through their lines was more than they dared to do. It was true that they still had the pass signed by the Boer general, but after what had occurred not unnaturally they were somewhat sceptical about the value of a pass, and certainly most unwilling to put its efficacy to the proof. So after due consideration they determined to avoid Standerton and ride in the opposite direction till they found a practicable ford of the Vaal. Fortunately, they both of them had a very good idea of the lay of the land; and, in addition to this, John possessed a small compass, fastened to his watch-chain, which would enable him to steer a fairly correct course across a veldt--a fact that rendered them independent of the waggon tracks. On the roads they were exposed to the risk, if not the certainty, of detection. But on the wide veldt the chances were they would meet no living creature except the wild game. Should they see houses they could avoid them, and probably their male inhabitants would be far away from home on business connected with the war.|$|E

5000|$|The English <b>hunting</b> <b>saddle</b> is the {{predecessor}} of all English-type riding saddles. As the sports of show jumping and eventing became more popular, saddle shape changed. Caprilli, Santini, and Toptani developed the [...] "forward seat," [...] {{in which the}} rider uses shorter stirrups and keeps his legs under him as he rode in two-point, with his seat bones hovering above the saddle. The shorter stirrup required a more forward flap, to match the greater knee angle of the rider. The protruding stirrup bars were uncomfortable in this new position, so they were recessed. The waist of the saddle was also made narrower. Additionally, padding was placed under the knee rolls, for extra security.|$|E

5000|$|Sidesaddles {{may be used}} {{in almost}} every discipline, {{including}} show jumping. In the USA, the four main divisions in modern horse shows are Western, <b>Hunt</b> seat, <b>Saddle</b> seat (the two English divisions use the same basic style of saddle but different bridles and rider appointments), and [...] "historical," [...] which may depict any culture or period, but must be fully researched and correctly utilized.|$|R
5000|$|This saddle {{is used in}} the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere, {{for showing}} on the flat or over low fences, and is a direct {{descendant}} of the English <b>hunting</b> <b>saddle.</b> The show saddle is designed to show off the horse's conformation, most notably the shoulder, and is therefore a minimal saddle with a close fit and straight-cut flap. The seat is very flat, and there are no knee or thigh rolls, so the saddle offers little support to the rider. Like the American Saddle Seat saddle, the English showing saddle has a stirrup bar set farther forward and a cutback pommel that falls behind rather than over the withers, though the seat is less flat and the rider's center of balance is closer to that of a dressage saddle. Many show horses are also presented in fatter condition than in more athletic disciplines, so the billets are placed to help keep the saddle properly placed on a rounder animal, with the foremost billet on show pony saddles frequently being attached directly to the point of the front arch of the tree; this is known as a [...] "forward point".|$|E

A large yurt {{may take the}} bark from up to 32 trees to make; a medium-sized yurt is made from the bark of 23-25 trees. An opening of 2-3 meters in height allows access to the yurt. A bag that houses the guardian spirits of a shaman rests {{in the rear of}} the yurt. On the right side, the Dukha family will keep its <b>hunting</b> equipment, <b>saddles,</b> tools and utensils. A traditional Dukha yurt will not have a bed, but rather skins covering the ground, upon which the family sleeps. A stove sits in the middle of the yurt.|$|R

50|$|More specifically, equitation may {{refer to}} a rider's {{position}} while mounted, and encompasses a rider's ability to ride correctly and with effective aids. In horse show competition, the rider, rather than the horse is evaluated. Such classes go by different names, depending on region, including equitation classes, rider classes, or horsemanship classes. Judging criteria covers the rider's performance {{and control of the}} horse, use of riding aids, proper attire, correct form, and usually factor in rider poise and the cleanliness and polish of horse, rider and equipment. The performance of the horse is not judged per se, but a poorly performing horse is considered to reflect the ability of the rider. Equitation classes occur in the <b>Hunt</b> seat, <b>Saddle</b> seat, Dressage, and Western disciplines. A good equitation rider is always in balance with the horse, maintains a correct position in every gait, movement, or over a fence, and possesses a commanding, but relaxed, presence, able to direct the horse with nearly invisible aids.|$|R
2500|$|The {{clothing}} of the Western rider {{differs from}} that of the [...] "English" [...] style dressage, <b>hunt</b> seat or <b>Saddle</b> seat rider. Practical Western attire consists of a long-sleeved work shirt, denim jeans, boots, and a wide-brimmed cowboy hat. Usually a rider wears protective leather leggings called [...] "chaps" [...] (from the Spanish chaparajos; often pronounced [...] "shaps") to help the rider stick to the saddle and to protect the legs when riding through brush. [...] Clean, well-fitting work clothing is the usual outfit seen in rodeo, cutting and reining competitions, especially for men, though sometimes in brighter colors or finer fabrics.|$|R

Thus, many riders who wish to ride sidesaddle are often found <b>hunting</b> for older <b>saddles</b> at antique shops, estate sales, attics or barn lofts. It is difficult to find an antique sidesaddle that not only fits the rider and horse but also is in good condition. Old sidesaddles usually need reconditioning, sometimes even requiring complete removal of the leather and examination of the tree. Antique sidesaddles are frequently a problem to fit, as many are too narrow for modern horses.|$|R

The district was created in the early 1990s from parts of Jamestown and Longwood Districts. There is no settlement by that name, however, as it was named after the gun battery that used to be fired when unidentified ships were spotted. It includes the areas of The Briars, Seaview, Two Gun <b>Saddle,</b> <b>Hunts</b> Vale and Alarm Hill. Alarm Forest is the only district that does not border the ocean. Its population has grown from 276 in 1998 to 289 in 2008 and 383 in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The English riding classes {{fall into}} two primary styles, <b>hunt</b> seat and <b>saddle</b> seat. [...] "Hunt type" [...] or sport horse classes include dressage, show jumping and show hunters, Eventing (also called horse trials), and English {{pleasure}} or Hunter Under Saddle, {{also known as a}} [...] "flat" [...] class, where the event is judged on presentation, manners and rideability of the horse). [...] "Saddle seat" [...] or [...] "Saddle type" [...] classes are all on the flat and are mostly variations on English Pleasure, though the high action [...] "Park" [...] style classes differ because they emphasize brilliant trotting action. Equitation classes judge the form and ability of the rider.|$|R
50|$|Antler {{has been}} used through history as a {{material}} to make tools, weapons, ornaments, and toys. It was an especially important material in the European Late Paleolithic, used by the Magdalenian culture to make carvings and engraved designs on objects such as the so-called Bâton de commandements and the Bison Licking Insect Bite. In the Viking Age and medieval period, it formed an important raw material in the craft of comb-making. In later periods, antler - used as a cheap substitute for ivory - was a material especially associated with equipment for <b>hunting,</b> such as <b>saddles</b> and horse harness, guns and daggers, powder flasks, as well as buttons and the like. The decorative display of wall-mounted pairs of antlers has been popular since medieval times at least.|$|R
50|$|The term English saddle {{encompasses}} several types, {{including those}} used for show jumping and <b>hunt</b> seat, dressage, <b>Saddle</b> seat, horse racing and polo. To non-horsemen, the major distinguishing feature of an English saddle is {{its lack of}} a horn. However, some Western saddles, such as those used to ride rough stock in rodeos and certain types of western-influenced saddles used in endurance riding, lack a horn as well. These saddles can still be classified as western-influenced, however, due to the deep seat, high cantle, prominent pommels, wide fenders (stirrup leathers) and large, leather-covered stirrups. In addition, saddles used for working cattle in nations other than the United States, such as the Australian Stock Saddle and the Charro Saddles of South America, often share stock saddle features such as a deep seat and extra leather to protect horse and rider, but lack a horn.|$|R
5000|$|The exhibitor, male or female, must wear pants, a {{shirt with}} a tie or brooch, and boots. Some show rules require a hat. Gloves are optional, but usually worn by winning exhibitors because they provide a better grip on the lead shank and give a {{polished}} look. Jackets or vests are also optional, but common. If the handler is showing English style, they wear the same jodhpurs or breeches and boots as they would wear in a riding class, with appropriate <b>hunt</b> seat or <b>saddle</b> seat hats, neckwear, and jackets. In a few breeds, showmanship exhibitors, both male and female, may instead choose to wear a business suit similar to what might be worn to an office or other white collar work setting. Western handlers may wear either western riding clothing or a business-style outfit, augmented by a cowboy hat and boots ...|$|R
60|$|Seeing {{the elder}} men engaged in talk Tom {{did not return}} to them, but endeavoured to keep up a {{conversation}} with the young Indian, whom he found to be willing enough to talk now they were alone, and who knew much more English than he had given him credit for. As soon as the sun set the fire was extinguished, and they lay down to sleep shortly afterwards. An hour before daylight they were in the <b>saddle.</b> <b>Hunting</b> Dog rode ahead on the line he had followed the day before. As soon as it became light Tom kept his eyes fixed upon the ground, but it was only now and then, when the Indian pointed to the print of a horse's hoof in the sand between the rocks, that he could make them out. The two Indians followed the track, however, without the slightest difficulty, the horses going at a hand gallop.|$|R
50|$|Paddock boots, {{also known}} as Jodhpur boots, are short boots that come just above the ankle, used most often for {{pleasure}} riding and everyday use. They are also required for Saddle seat style riding and are frequently worn by children when showing in hunt seat disciplines because they are less costly for rapidly growing children than are tall boots. They are sometimes combined with half chaps, a type of gaiter {{also known as}} chapettes, for added protection or to give the visual impression of a tall boot. The lace-up style is primarily seen in hunt seat riding, whereas the elastic-sided Chelsea boot design is seen in both <b>hunt</b> seat and <b>saddle</b> seat disciplines. The elastic side boot is also commonly used in Australia as a riding boot and dress boot. They {{are part of the}} required attire in Australian Stock Horse turnout competitions and for Pony Club riding. Heavier versions, such as Blundstone boots, are made for general work and gardening but are not suitable for riding owing to their heavy, deep-grooved soles.|$|R

[...] "The word given, the horsemen start in a body, loading and firing on horseback, and leaving the dead animals to be identified after the run is over. The kind of horse used is called a [...] "buffalo runner," [...] and is very valuable. A good one will cost from 50 to 70 pounds sterling. The sagacity of the animal is chiefly shewn in bringing his rider alongside the retreating buffalo, and in avoiding the numerous pitfalls abounding on the prairie. The most treacherous of the latter are the badger holes.Considering the bold nature of the sport, remarkably few accidents occur. The hunters enter the herd with their mouths full of bullets. A handful of gunpowder is let fall from their [...] "powder horns," [...] a bullet is dropped from the mouth into the muzzle, a tap with the butt end of the firelock on the saddle causes the salivated bullet {{to adhere to the}} powder during the second necessary to depress the barrel, when the discharge is instantly effected without bringing the gun to the shoulder."
