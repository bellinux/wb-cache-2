5|$|The <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a {{risk for}} {{premature}} death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they {{block out the}} feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> was run {{without the}} {{incidents}} that plagued {{the first three}} stages. Pothier, Maurice and César Garin and Beaugendre reached Bordeaux together, and the stage was decided by the final kilometre in the velodrome, where Pothier recorded the fastest time.|$|E

5|$|An {{improvement}} of the CFM56-5A series, it was originally designed to power the A321. With a thrust range between 22,000 and 33,000lbf (98kN and 147kN) it can power every model in the A320 family (A318/A319/A320/A321) and has superseded the CFM56-5A series. Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NOx), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to modern stage races, a cyclist {{who gave up}} during a stage was allowed to start again the next stage, although {{he would no longer}} be in contention for the general classification. Thus Hippolyte Aucouturier, who gave up during the first stage, was able to return, and won the second and third stages. Charles Laeser, winner of the <b>fourth</b> <b>stage,</b> had not completed the third stage.|$|E
5|$|Sixty cyclists, all {{professionals}} or semi-professionals, {{started the}} race, of whom 49 were French, 4 Belgian, 4 Swiss, 2 German, and one Italian; 21 {{of them were}} sponsored by bicycle manufacturers, while 39 entered without commercial support. 24 other cyclists {{took advantage of the}} opportunity to enter specific stages: one rode in both the second and fourth stages, and additionally three cyclists took part in the second stage, one in the third stage, fifteen in the <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> only, and a further four only competed in the fifth stage.|$|E

5|$|The 2016 Volta a Catalunya {{included}} seven stages, all {{of which}} were road stages with no time trials. The first two stages were moderately hilly and were possibly suitable for sprinters. The third and <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> both included summit finishes. The third stage finished on the climb of La Molina, with the fourth finishing at Port Ainé. The fifth stage included a climb shortly before the finish, giving an opportunity for an attack, before another flat stage on the sixth day. The final stage finished on a hilly circuit in Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|The Varaha Upanishad, in Chapter 4, {{states that}} {{individuals}} gain knowledge through seven stages: First, one must have virtuous desire to learn, discover (Subh-echchha). The second stage is inquiry, investigation (Vichārana). Discernment and thinning of mind toward other objects (Tanumanasi) {{is the third}} stage, states the text. The <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> is harmony, creative union with the subject of knowledge (Sattva-patti). Detachment from everything else (Asamsakti) is the fifth stage. Conceptual analysis and gaining complete, correct meaning of the topic (Pad-artha-bhavana) is the sixth stage. The seventh or last stage is Turiya, complete consciousness.|$|E
5|$|The event {{began with}} a long {{primarily}} flat stage that was won by Dario Beni. He lost the lead after the next stage to the eventual winner Luigi Ganna, who in turn lost it to Carlo Galetti after the mountainous third stage. Ganna regained the lead after the <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> and successfully defended {{it all the way}} to the finish in Milan, winning three stages en route. Atala won the team classification.|$|E

5|$|The mildest form of hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is difficult to}} detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing. It is experienced as forgetfulness, mild confusion, and irritability. The first stage of {{hepatic encephalopathy}} is characterised by an inverted sleep-wake pattern (sleeping by day, being awake at night). The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the <b>fourth</b> <b>stage,</b> the level then increments, and the game repeats the stages with progressive difficulty. For example, Donkey Kong begins to hurl barrels faster and sometimes diagonally, and fireballs get speedier. The victory music alternates between levels 1 and 2. The fourth level however, consists of 5 stages with the final stage at 125m. The 22nd level is colloquially known as the kill screen, due to an error in the game's programming that kills Mario after a few seconds, effectively ending the game.|$|E
5|$|Atala-Dunlop's Luigi Ganna {{abandoned}} the race during the fifth stage due to injuries {{suffered from a}} crash during the <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> before it was cancelled. Galetti won the fifth leg, but with the placings on the stage, Peugeot took the race lead from Atala-Dunlop. Rain marred {{the start of the}} sixth stage at 6:40 local time, as well as most of the stage itself. A group of sixteen riders formed {{at the front of the}} race and was later reduced to ten before passing through Lucca. Lauro Bordin of the Gerbi team attacked and went on to ride solo, reaching the checkpoint in Spezia fifteen minutes quicker than Azzini, Cocchi, and Agostoni. Bordin reached the finish first, eighteen minutes ahead of the second-place finisher.|$|E

5|$|Berzin first {{gained the}} race lead after the <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> where he {{attacked}} {{on the final}} climb to win the day. The race's overall classification was first headed by Endrio Leoni who won the Giro's opening road stage. However, Leoni lost the lead later that day during the afternoon individual time trial to Armand de Las Cuevas. De Las Cuevas held the lead for a single stage before losing it to Moreno Argentin who won the race's second stage. Argentin held the general classification lead for two stages, before Berzin took it after stage 4. After gaining the lead, Berzin began to build upon his advantage after winning the stage 8 and 18 individual time trials and maintaining good form throughout the mountains.|$|E
5|$|Cominco had {{produced}} electrolytic hydrogen at Trail, British Columbia, since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 {{that it could}} produce heavy water. To the existing $10million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the deuterium concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process, Hugh Taylor of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon catalyst {{for the first three}} stages while Urey developed a nickel-chromia one for the <b>fourth</b> <b>stage</b> tower. The final cost was $2.8million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's heavy water production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. Heavy water from Trail was used for Chicago Pile 3, the first reactor using heavy water and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>fourth</b> <b>stage,</b> Aucouturier {{had a clear}} {{lead and}} seemed set to win a third {{successive}} stage, but was caught using the slipstream of a car, and {{was removed from the}} race. Swiss Charles Laeser (who had abandoned in the 3rd stage) took the victory, becoming the first non-French winner. As in the third stage, the cyclists departed in two groups, and Laeser was in the second group because he was no longer contending for the general classification. Laeser finished more than 50 minutes after a group of six cyclists, but he had travelled the distance 4 minutes faster than them, so he was declared the winner.|$|E
