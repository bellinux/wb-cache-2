40|$|Texture {{mapping of}} 3 D {{digitized}} data is a challenge. This arises mainly due to two factors: i) <b>digitization</b> <b>of</b> geometry and ii) <b>digitization</b> <b>of</b> textures. First, due to <b>digitization</b> <b>of</b> geometry {{we have a}} basket of polygons that represent the digitized object. Second, due to <b>digitization</b> <b>of</b> textures, we get another basket of textures that represent the digitized texture of the whole object. Unfortunately, {{there is little or}} no correspondence between the digitized geometry and digitized texture. The challenge is to automatically identify the correspondence between the merged geometry and merged texture and then to perform an intelligent texture mapping. In this work, we have shown two procedures that perform 3 D texture mapping using a combination of image warping and direct texture mapping...|$|R

The study, based on the systematization and analysis of existing scientific approaches to definition <b>of</b> essence <b>of</b> <b>tolling</b> and tolling operations, has disclosed the dominating poli-positionality and ambiguity in this area. Economical autonomy <b>of</b> <b>tolling</b> operations has been determined, their difference from the operations with customerfurnished raw materials has been allocated, substance and characteristics <b>of</b> <b>tolling</b> operations has been conceptually grounded, motives of their implementation for both the customer and the provider has been systematized. It is proved that implementation <b>of</b> <b>tolling</b> operations will address the pivotal financial, production and staffing problems of domestic enterprises and ensure their progressive development in conditions of the European integration.
