25|$|A similar {{use of the}} {{thymidine}} kinase makes use of the presence in some tumor cells of substances not present in normal cells (tumor markers). Such tumor markers are, for instance, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and AFP (alpha fetoprotein). The genes for these tumor markers {{may be used as}} promoter genes for {{thymidine kinase}}. Thymidine kinase can then be activated in cells expressing the tumor marker but not in normal cells, such that treatment with <b>ganciclovir</b> kills only the tumor cells. Such gene therapy-based approaches are still experimental, however, as problems associated with targeting the gene transfer to the tumor cells have not yet been completely solved.|$|E
25|$|Some {{antiviral}} drugs, such as acyclovir (ATC: J05AB01) and <b>ganciclovir</b> (ATC: J05AB06) as well {{as other}} nucleoside analogs make use of the substrate specificity of viral thymidine kinase, as opposed to human thymidine kinases. These drugs act as prodrugs, which in themselves are not toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase. Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic triphosphates that lead to cell death. Human thymidine kinase, in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific thymidine kinase. In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of antiviral drug resistance is frequently observed. Sequencing the thymidine kinase gene in Herpes simplex virus and Varicella zoster virus shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of antiviral drug resistance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{herpesvirus}} {{thymidine kinase}} gene {{has also been}} used as a “suicide gene” as a safety system in gene therapy experiments, allowing cells expressing the gene to be killed using <b>ganciclovir.</b> This is desirable in case the recombinant gene causes a mutation leading to uncontrolled cell growth (insertional mutagenesis). The thymidine kinase produced by these modified cells may diffuse to neighboring cells, rendering them similarly susceptible to <b>ganciclovir,</b> a phenomenon known as the [...] "bystander effect." [...] This approach has been used to treat cancer in animal models, and is advantageous in that the tumor may be killed with as few as 10% of malignant cells expressing the gene. A similar system has been tried using tomato thymidine kinase and AZT.|$|E
2500|$|Antibiotics are {{commonly}} used to prevent secondary bacterial infection. [...] There are no specific antiviral drugs in common use at this time for FVR, although one study has shown that <b>ganciclovir,</b> PMEDAP, and cidofovir hold promise for treatment. More recent {{research has indicated that}} systemic famciclovir is effective at treating this infection in cats without the side effects reported with other anti-viral agents. [...] More severe cases may require supportive care such as intravenous fluid therapy, oxygen therapy, or even a feeding tube. [...] Conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers are treated with topical antibiotics for secondary bacterial infection.|$|E
50|$|While not {{studied in}} people, {{it can be}} assumed that {{interactions}} will be similar as those with <b>ganciclovir,</b> since valganciclovir is converted into <b>ganciclovir</b> in the body. Zidovudine may decrease the concentration of <b>ganciclovir,</b> and together the drugs can cause anemia and neutropenia. Probenecid can increase the concentration of <b>ganciclovir,</b> which could increase the chances of <b>ganciclovir</b> toxicity. People with kidney problems could have an increase in both mycophenolate mofetil and <b>ganciclovir</b> concentrations when both drugs are taken together. <b>Ganciclovir</b> can also increase the concentration of didanosine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ganciclovir</b> {{is first}} {{phosphorylated}} to <b>ganciclovir</b> monophosphate by a viral thymidine kinase encoded by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) upon infection. Human cellular kinases further phosphorylate the molecule to create <b>ganciclovir</b> diphosphate, then <b>ganciclovir</b> triphosphate. These kinases {{are present in}} 10-fold greater concentrations in CMV or herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected cells compared to uninfected human cells, allowing <b>ganciclovir</b> triphosphate to concentrate in infected cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ganciclovir</b> is a {{synthetic}} analogue of 2′-deoxy-guanosine. It is first phosphorylated to <b>ganciclovir</b> monophosphate by a viral kinase encoded by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) gene UL97 during infection. Subsequently, cellular kinases catalyze {{the formation of}} <b>ganciclovir</b> diphosphate and <b>ganciclovir</b> triphosphate, which is present in 10-fold greater concentrations in CMV or herpes simplex virus (HSV)-infected cells than uninfected cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ganciclovir</b> {{triphosphate}} is {{a competitive}} inhibitor of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP). It is incorporated into viral DNA and preferentially inhibits viral DNA polymerases more than cellular DNA polymerases. <b>Ganciclovir</b> triphosphate {{serves as a}} poor substrate for chain elongation. Once incorporated into viral DNA due to its structure similarity to dGTP, chain termination occurs once a single nucleotide {{is added to the}} distal hydroxyl group of the incomplete deoxyribose ring of <b>ganciclovir.</b>|$|E
50|$|Valganciclovir is a prodrug for <b>ganciclovir,</b> {{which is}} a {{synthetic}} analog of 2′-deoxy-guanosine. Its structure {{is the same as}} <b>ganciclovir,</b> except for the addition of a L-valyl ester at the 5' end of the incomplete deoxyribose ring. The valine increases both the absorption of the drug in the intestines, as well as the bioavailability of the drug once it is absorbed. The L-valyl ester is cleaved by esterases in the intestines and the liver, leaving <b>ganciclovir</b> to be absorbed by the virus-infected cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ganciclovir</b> {{triphosphate}} is {{a competitive}} inhibitor of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP) incorporation into DNA and preferentially inhibits viral DNA polymerases more than cellular DNA polymerases. In addition, <b>ganciclovir</b> triphosphate {{serves as a}} poor substrate for chain elongation, thereby disrupting viral DNA synthesis by a second route.|$|E

50|$|In {{individuals}} {{treated with}} the DNA polymerase inhibitors acyclovir or <b>ganciclovir,</b> HSV or CMV particles can develop mutant protein kinases (thymidine kinase or UL97 protein kinase, respectively) that make them resistant to these antiviral drugs. However, unlike acyclovir and <b>ganciclovir,</b> foscarnet is not activated by viral protein kinases, making it useful in acyclovir- or ganciclovir-resistant HSV and CMV infections.|$|E

50|$|Often {{individuals}} with CMV retinitis will need surgery for either retinal detachment or intravitreal instillation of <b>ganciclovir.</b> Retinal detachment occurs {{in up to}} 29% of affected eyes, repair being most effective with endolaser and silicone oil endotamponade.Intravitreal <b>ganciclovir</b> implant has the benefit of less systemic toxicity. An adverse effect of this is retinal detachment (and vitreous hemorrhage), also there is no systemic beneficial effect for cytomegalovirus organ disease.|$|E
50|$|Most {{cases of}} HHV-6 {{infection}} get better on its own. If encephalitis occurs <b>ganciclovir</b> or foscarnet may be useful.|$|E
5000|$|Valganciclovir is {{eliminated}} as <b>ganciclovir</b> in the urine, with a half-life of about 4 hours {{in people with}} normal kidney function.|$|E
50|$|His {{scientific}} achievements {{include the}} development of an automated process for the manufacture of RNA, and the invention of the drug <b>Ganciclovir.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Ganciclovir</b> is an {{antiviral}} medication used {{to treat}} cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. A prodrug form with improved oral bioavailability (valganciclovir) has also been developed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ganciclovir</b> is also {{available}} in slow-release formulations for insertion into the vitreous humour of the eye, as treatment for CMV retinitis (associated with HIV infection).|$|E
50|$|Nucleosidic class {{drugs such}} as acyclovir, valacyclovir and <b>ganciclovir</b> are inhibitors of viral {{replication}} during DNA (for DNA- and retroviruses) or RNA (for RNA viruses) multiplication.|$|E
50|$|Martin {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of antiviral therapeutics. He has helped to develop drugs including <b>ganciclovir,</b> cidofovir, oseltamivir, adefovir, tenofovir, didanosine, stavudine, tenofovir, emtricitabine, Truvada, Atripla, Complera, Stribild and Sofosbuvir.|$|E
50|$|Negative {{selectable}} markers are selectable markers that eliminate or inhibit {{growth of}} the host organism upon selection. An example would be thymidine kinase, which makes the host sensitive to <b>ganciclovir</b> selection.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ganciclovir</b> (Cytovene) {{treatment}} {{is used for}} patients with depressed immunity who have either sight-related or life-threatening illnesses. Valganciclovir (Valcyte) is an antiviral drug that is also effective and is given orally. The therapeutic effectiveness is frequently compromised {{by the emergence of}} drug-resistant virus isolates. A variety of amino acid changes in the UL97 protein kinase and the viral DNA polymerase have been reported to cause drug resistance. Foscarnet or cidofovir are only given to patients with CMV resistant to <b>ganciclovir,</b> because foscarnet has notable nephrotoxicity, resulting in increased or decreased Ca2+ or P, and decreased Mg2+.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ganciclovir</b> is {{considered}} a potential human carcinogen, teratogen, and mutagen. It is also considered likely to cause inhibition of spermatogenesis. Thus, it is used judiciously and handled as a cytotoxic drug in the clinical setting.|$|E
