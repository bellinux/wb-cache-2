5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas {{supply to the}} cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to flow into the cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and <b>disconnecting</b> it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E
5|$|Marla overdoses on {{pills and}} {{telephones}} the Narrator for help; he eventually ignores her, leaving his phone receiver without <b>disconnecting.</b> Tyler notices the phone soon after, talks {{to her and}} goes to her apartment to save her. Tyler and Marla become sexually involved. He warns the Narrator never to talk to Marla about him. More fight clubs form across the country and, under Tyler's leadership (and without the Narrator's knowledge), they become an anti-materialist and anti-corporate organization, Project Mayhem, {{with many of the}} former local Fight Club members moving into the dilapidated house and improving it.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{define a}} graph to be {{neighbor}} <b>disconnected</b> if {{the removal of}} the closed neighborhood of a vertex leaves a <b>disconnected</b> induced subgraph. Our main theorem is that a vertex transitive graph is neighbor <b>disconnected</b> if and only if it is a wreath product of vertex transitive graphs, with the necessary restriction that one factor must be neighbor <b>disconnected</b> whenever the other factor is a clique. Among the applications, we describe all connected neighbor <b>disconnected</b> vertex transitive graphs of degree not exceeding 10, and characterize the generating sets of all neighbor <b>disconnected</b> Cayley graphs...|$|R

5|$|Before {{implementing}} Steam, Valve Corporation {{had problems}} updating its online games, such as Counter-Strike; providing patches {{would result in}} most of the online user base <b>disconnecting</b> for several days. Valve decided to create a platform that would update games automatically and implement stronger anti-piracy and anti-cheat measures. Through user polls {{at the time of its}} announcement in 2002, Valve also recognized that at least 75% of their users had access to high-speed Internet connections, which would only grow with planned Internet expansion in the following years, and recognized that they could deliver game content faster to players than through retail channels. Valve approached several companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and RealNetworks to build a client with these features, but were declined.|$|E
5|$|Each side then {{attempted}} to rush all available pilots into the system, and the game's time dilation software engaged. Time dilation {{is a game}} feature created by developer CCP Games to handle heavy loads on the game server without the game lagging or <b>disconnecting</b> players. In time dilation, the game slows to ten percent normal speed, with each second of game time displaying as ten seconds of real time. The two sides traded Titan kills every hour, when their Doomsday weapons could fire again, and the system became filled with warp disruption bubbles, making extraction difficult. For a while neither side gained any real advantage, though CFC/Rus managed to on-line their Territorial Control Units and held a slight lead {{in the number of}} enemy Titans destroyed. Throughout the engagement, related battles played out across the entire game universe as fleets tried to block reinforcements, destroy fleeing capitals and super-capitals, or trap pilots attempting to enter the fray.|$|E
5|$|The CLR's {{ability to}} manage its high {{passenger}} numbers was constrained by the service interval that it could achieve between trains. This was {{directly related to the}} time taken to turn around trains at the termini. At the end of a journey, a locomotive had to be disconnected from the leading end of the train and run around to the rear, where it was reconnected before proceeding in the opposite direction; an exercise that took a minimum of 2½minutes. Seeking to shorten this interval, the CLR published a bill in November 1900 for the 1901 parliamentary session. The bill requested permission to construct loops {{at each end of the}} line so that trains could be turned around without <b>disconnecting</b> the locomotive. The loop at the western end was planned to run anti-clockwise under the three sides of Shepherd's Bush Green. For the eastern loop the alternatives were a loop under Liverpool Street station or a larger loop running under Threadneedle Street, Old Broad Street, Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate and returning to Threadneedle Street. The estimated cost of the loops was £800,000 (approximately £ today), most of which was for the eastern loop with its costly wayleaves.|$|E

25|$|The <b>disconnecting</b> {{circuit breaker}} (DCB) was {{introduced}} in 2000 and is a high-voltage circuit breaker modeled after the SF6-breaker. It presents a technical solution where the <b>disconnecting</b> function is integrated in the breaking chamber, {{eliminating the need for}} separate disconnectors. This increases the availability, since open-air <b>disconnecting</b> switch main contacts need maintenance every 2–6 years, while modern circuit breakers have maintenance intervals of 15 years. Implementing a DCB solution also reduces the space requirements within the substation, and increases the reliability, {{due to the lack of}} separate disconnectors.|$|E

25|$|Ryder then {{proceeds}} to the presumed location of Meridian, which is {{revealed to be}} an ancient Remnant city. Ryder discovers that Meridian, a Dyson sphere-like construct, was taken away from the city, <b>disconnecting</b> the vaults and rendering the planets uninhabitable. The Archon launches an attack on Hyperion, severing SAM from Ryder, while also capturing Ryder's sibling, whose SAM implant he intends to use {{in order to take}} over Meridian. Ryder manages to activate the Remnant fleet and, together with other allied forces, makes an assault on the kett fleet guarding Meridian. The Ryder twins work to defeat the kett, eventually <b>disconnecting</b> the Archon from Meridian's system and killing him in the process. Ryder is hailed as a hero, having activated Meridian and made the cluster more suitable for settlement. Hyperion, after crash-landing onto Meridian, settles on the planet as humanity's new home.|$|E
