5|$|Biopsy of {{the kidney}} may be {{performed}} both {{to establish the}} diagnosis or to assess the severity of already suspected kidney disease. The main findings on kidney biopsy are increased cells and Ig deposition in the mesangium (part of the <b>glomerulus,</b> where blood is filtered), white blood cells, {{and the development of}} crescents. The changes are indistinguishable from those observed in IgA nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each <b>glomerulus</b> has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} envaginations form {{a series}} of transverse tubules each of which communicates {{by means of a}} funnel-shaped ciliated opening with the abdominal cavity, {{and in the course of}} each duct a <b>glomerulus</b> also is developed. A secondary <b>glomerulus</b> is formed ventral to each of these, and the complete group constitutes the pronephros. In humans, the pronephros is just rudimentary, and undergoes rapid atrophy and disappears.|$|E
25|$|In {{nephrotic}} syndrome, the <b>glomerulus</b> {{has been}} damaged {{so that a}} large amount of protein in the blood enters the urine. Other frequent features of the nephrotic syndrome include swelling, low serum albumin, and high cholesterol.|$|E
25|$|Glomerulonephritis* is the {{presence}} of immune complexes in the <b>glomerulus,</b> resulting in leakage of protein into the urine. It can be caused by cancer, heartworm disease, pyometra, rickettsial infection, or systemic lupus erythematosus. It can result in chronic kidney failure, hypoalbuminemia, which can cause ascites and peripheral edema, and nephrotic syndrome, which can cause hypertension or hypercoagulability.|$|E
25|$|On {{the medial}} {{side of the}} Wolffian duct, from the sixth {{cervical}} to the third lumbar segments, a series of tubules, the Wolffian tubules, develops. They increase in number by outgrowths from the original tubules. They change from solid masses of cells to instead become hollowed in the center. One end grows toward and finally opens into the Wolffian duct, the other dilates and is invaginated by a tuft of capillary bloodvessels to form a <b>glomerulus.</b> The tubules collectively constitute the mesonephros.|$|E
25|$|Renal {{pathology}} is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology {{that deals}} with the diagnosis and characterization of disease of the kidneys. In a medical setting, renal pathologists work closely with nephrologists and transplant surgeons, who typically obtain diagnostic specimens via percutaneous renal biopsy. The renal pathologist must synthesize findings from traditional microscope histology, electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Medical renal diseases may affect the <b>glomerulus,</b> the tubules and interstitium, the vessels, {{or a combination of}} these compartments.|$|E
25|$|In normal individuals, free light {{chains are}} rapidly cleared {{from the blood}} and catabolised by the kidneys. Monomeric free light chains are cleared in 2–4 hours, and dimeric light chains in 3–6 hours. Removal may be {{prolonged}} to 2–3 days in people with complete renal failure. Human kidneys are composed of approximately half a million nephrons. Each nephron contains a <b>glomerulus</b> with basement membrane pores that allow filtration of immunoglobulin light chains and other small molecules from the blood into the proximal tubule of the nephron.|$|E
25|$|The atherosclerotic, hypertension-related {{vascular}} lesions in {{the kidney}} primarily affect the preglomerular arterioles, resulting in ischemic {{changes in the}} glomeruli and postglomerular structures. Glomerular injury {{may also be a}} consequence of direct damage to the glomerular capillaries due to glomerular hyperperfusion. Glomerular pathology progresses to glomerulosclerosis, and eventually the renal tubules may also become ischemic and gradually atrophic. The renal lesion associated with malignant hypertension consists of fibrinoid necrosis of the afferent arterioles, sometimes extending into the <b>glomerulus,</b> and may result in focal necrosis of the glomerular tuft.|$|E
25|$|The disease derives {{its name}} from {{deposits}} of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in a granular pattern in the mesangium (by immunofluorescence), a region of the renal <b>glomerulus.</b> The mesangium by light microscopy may be hypercellular and show increased deposition of extracellular matrix proteins. In terms of the renal manifestation of Henoch–Schönlein purpura, {{it has been found}} that although it shares the same histological spectrum as IgA nephropathy, a greater frequency of severe lesions such as glomerular necrosis and crescents were observed. Correspondingly, HSP nephritis has a higher frequency of glomerular staining for fibrin compared with IgAN, but with an otherwise similar immunofluorescence profile.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, {{including}} humans, {{the transport}} of amino and imino acids from the lumen (interior) of the intestine or the renal proximal tubule into the cells occurs at the brush border membrane of the epithelium (moist, tightly packed cellular lining of many tissues and organs of the body). Here, cotransporters such as sodium or chloride (part {{of the system of}} Na-K-Cl cotransporters) couple with the amino or imino acids on the molecular level and transport them through specific integral membrane proteins that form ion channels, which are located within the cell membrane. From the cells, the absorbed or reabsorbed amino and imino acids eventually reach the blood. Absorption refers to the overall process happening in the intestine in lieu of normal digestive breakdown of proteins, while reabsorption refers to the process occurring in the renal proximal tubule to reclaim amino and imino acids that have been filtered out of the blood via the <b>glomerulus.</b>|$|E
500|$|Many other {{diseases}} of the kidney are associated with liver disease and must be excluded before making a diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] Individuals with pre-renal kidney failure do not have damage to the kidneys, but as in individuals with HRS, have kidney dysfunction due to decreased {{blood flow to the}} kidneys. Also, similarly to HRS, pre-renal kidney failure causes the formation of urine that has a very low sodium concentration. In contrast to HRS, however, pre-renal kidney failure usually responds to treatment with intravenous fluids, resulting in reduction in serum creatinine and increased excretion of sodium. [...] Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) involves damage to the tubules of the kidney, and can be a complication in individuals with cirrhosis, because of exposure to toxic medications or the development of decreased blood pressure. [...] Because of the damage to the tubules, ATN affected kidneys usually are unable to maximally resorb sodium from the urine. [...] As a result, ATN can be distinguished from HRS on the basis of laboratory testing, as individuals with ATN will have urine sodium measurements that are much higher than in HRS; however, this may not always be the case in cirrhotics. [...] Individuals with ATN also may have evidence of hyaline casts or muddy-brown casts in the urine on microscopy, whereas the urine of individuals with HRS is typically devoid of cellular material, as the kidneys have not been directly injured. [...] Some viral infections of the liver, including hepatitis B and hepatitis C can also lead to inflammation of the <b>glomerulus</b> of the kidney. [...] Other causes of kidney failure in individuals with liver disease include drug toxicity (notably, the antibiotic gentamicin) or contrast nephropathy, caused by intravenous administration of contrast agents used for medical imaging tests.|$|E

2500|$|The table below {{shows the}} path that blood takes when it travels through the <b>glomerulus,</b> {{traveling}} [...] "down" [...] the arteries and [...] "up" [...] the veins. However, this model is greatly simplified for clarity and symmetry. Some of the other paths and complications are described {{at the bottom of}} the table. The interlobar artery and vein (not to be confused with interlobular) are between two renal lobes, also known as the renal column (cortex region between two pyramids).|$|E
2500|$|IgA {{nephropathy}} is {{the most}} common glomerulonephritis worldwide. Primary IgA nephropathy is characterized by deposition of the IgA antibody in the <b>glomerulus.</b> There are other diseases associated with glomerular IgA deposits, the most common being IgA vasculitis (formerly known as Henoch–Schönlein purpura [...] ), which is {{considered by many to be}} a systemic form of IgA nephropathy. IgA vasculitis presents with a characteristic purpuric skin rash, arthritis, and abdominal pain and occurs more commonly in young adults (16–35 years old). HSP is associated with a more benign prognosis than IgA nephropathy. In IgA nephropathy there is a slow progression to chronic kidney failure in 25–30% of cases during a period of 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|The ideal {{treatment}} for IgAN would remove IgA from the <b>glomerulus</b> and prevent further IgA deposition. [...] This goal still remains a remote prospect. There {{are a few}} additional caveats {{that have to be}} considered while treating IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy has a very variable course, ranging from a benign recurrent hematuria up to a rapid progression to chronic kidney failure. Hence the decision on which patients to treat should be based on the prognostic factors and the risk of progression. Also, IgA nephropathy recurs in transplants despite the use of ciclosporin, azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and steroids in these patients. There are persisting uncertainties, due to the limited number of patients included in the few controlled randomized studies performed to date, which hardly produce statistically significant evidence regarding the heterogeneity of IgA nephropathy patients, the diversity of study treatment protocols, and the length of follow-up.|$|E

60|$|Section 62. Similar from a {{physiological}} point of view, to the secretory glands which form the digestive fluids are those which furnish lubricating fluids, the lachrymal gland, and Harderian glands in the orbit internally to the eye, and posterior and anterior to it respectively, the sebaceous glands (oil glands) {{connected with the}} hair, and the anal and perineal glands. The secretions of excretory glands are removed from the body; chief among them are the sweat glands and kidneys. The sweat glands are microscopic tubular glands, terminating internally in a small coil (Figure VIII. s.g.) and are scattered thickly over the body, the water of their secretion being constantly removed by evaporation, and the small percentage of salt and urea remaining to accumulate as dirt, and the chief reasonable excuse for washing. The kidney structure is shown diagrammatically in Figure 5, Sheet 7. A great number of branching and straight looped, tubuli (little tubes) converge on an open space, the pelvis. Towards the outer layers (cortex) of the kidney, these tubuli terminate in little dilatations into which tangled knots of blood-vessels project: the dilatations are called Bowman's capsules (B.c.), and each coil of bloodvessel a <b>glomerulus</b> (gl.). In the capsules, water is drained from the blood; in the tubuli, urea and other salts in the urine are secreted from a branching network of vessels.|$|E
60|$|Section 18. The {{origin of}} the renal organ and duct has very {{considerable}} controversial interest.* In Figure 13, Sheet 22, a diagrammatic cross-section, of an embryo is shown. I. is the intestine, coe. the coelom, s.c. the spinal cord; n.c. the notochord, surrounded by n.s., the notochordal sheath, ao. is the dorsal aorta. In the masses of somatic mesoblast on either side, a longitudinal canal appears, which, in the torpedo, a fish related to the dog-fish, and in the rabbit, and possibly in all other cases, is epiblastic in origin. This is the segmental duct, which persists, apparently, as the Wolffian duct (W.D.). Ventral to this appears a parallel canal, the Mullerian duct (M.D.), which {{is often described as}} being split off from the segmental duct, but which is, very probably, an independent structure in the frog. A number of tubuli, at first metamerically arranged, now appear, each opening, on the one hand, into the coelom by a ciliated mouth, the nephrostome (n.s.), and on the other into the segmental duct. These tubuli are the segmental tubes or nephridia. There grows out from the aorta, towards each, a bunch, of bloodvessels, the <b>glomerulus</b> (compare Section 62, Rabbit). These tubuli ultimately become, in part, the renal tubuli, so that the primitive kidney stretches, at first, {{along the length of the}} body cavity from the region, of the gill-slits backward. The anterior part of the kidney, called the pronephros, disappears in the later larval stages. Internal to the kidney on either side there has appeared a longitudinal ridge, the genital ridge (g.r.), which gives rise to testes or ovary, as the case may be.|$|E

[...] Characteristics of these stages include: the role of olfactory plume and sniffing, the continuous renewal of <b>Glomerulus</b> receptors throughout the life cycle, and the relationship between the olfactory neuron and the <b>glomerulus,</b> and finally, the synthetic nature of <b>glomerulus</b> coding.|$|E

5000|$|Mesangial {{cells are}} {{specialised}} cells {{that make up}} the glomerular mesangium and, together with the mesangial matrix, forms the vascular pole of the <b>glomerulus.</b> The mesangial cell population accounts for approximately 30-40% of the total cells in the <b>glomerulus.</b> Mesangial cells can be categorised as either extraglomerular or intraglomerular (also known as glomerular mesangial cells) based on their relative location to the <b>glomerulus.</b> The extraglomerular mesangial cells are found between the afferent and efferent arterioles towards the vascular pole of the <b>glomerulus.</b> The extraglomerular mesangial cells are adjacent to the intraglomerular mesangial cells that are located inside the <b>glomerulus</b> and in between the capillaries. The primary function of mesangial cells is to remove trapped residues and aggregated protein from the basement membrane thus keeping the filter free of debris. The contractile properties of mesangial cells {{have been shown to be}} insignificant in changing the filtration pressure of the <b>glomerulus.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>glomerulus</b> {{receives}} its {{blood supply}} from an afferent arteriole of the renal circulation. Unlike most other capillary beds, the <b>glomerulus</b> drains into an efferent arteriole {{rather than a}} venule. The resistance of these arterioles results in high pressure within the <b>glomerulus,</b> aiding the process of ultrafiltration, where fluids and soluble materials in the blood are {{forced out of the}} capillaries and into Bowman's capsule.|$|E

5000|$|The efferent arterioles are {{blood vessels}} {{that are part}} of the urinary tract of organisms. Efferent (from Latin ex + facere) means [...] "outgoing", in this case meaning {{carrying}} blood out away from the <b>glomerulus.</b> The efferent arterioles form from a convergence of the capillaries of the <b>glomerulus,</b> and carry blood away from the <b>glomerulus</b> that has already been filtered. They play an important role in maintaining the glomerular filtration rate despite fluctuations in blood pressure.|$|E

50|$|The <b>glomerulus</b> is {{surrounded}} by a cup-like sac known as Bowman's capsule. The blood plasma is filtered through the capillaries of the <b>glomerulus</b> into the capsule.

50|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of {{nephritic syndrome}} {{is dependent on}} where damage is done by antibody-antigen complexes (in the <b>glomerulus).</b> In the case of IgA nephropathy, the <b>glomerulus</b> cannot filter IgA antibody-antigen, and this causes an inflammatory response, then release of cytokines (and growth factors), and finally results in glomerular scarring.|$|E
5000|$|Thus, a drop {{in blood}} {{pressure}} results in dilation of the afferent arterioles, increasing the GFR due to greater {{blood flow to the}} <b>glomerulus.</b> It also results in the release of renin, which, through the renin-angiotensin system, causes constriction of the efferent arterioles, which ultimately increases hydrostatic pressure in the <b>glomerulus.</b>|$|E
