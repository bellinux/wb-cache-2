40|$|Insider threat causes great <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>data</b> in any {{organization}} {{and is considered}} a serious issue. In spite {{of the presence of}} threat prevention mechanisms, sophisticated insiders still continue to attack a database with new techniques. One such technique which remains an advantage for insiders to attack databases is the dependency relationship among data items. This thesis investigates the ways by which an authorized insider detects dependencies in order to perform malicious write operations. The goal is to monitor malicious write operations performed by an insider by taking advantage of dependencies. A term called `threshold 2 ̆ 7 is associated with every data item, which defines the limit and constraints to which changes could be made to a data item by a write operation. Having threshold as the key factor, the thesis proposes two different attack prevention systems which involve log and dependency graphs that aid in monitoring malicious activities and ultimately secure the data items in a database. The proposed systems continuously monitors all the data items to prevent malicious operations, but the priority is to secure the most sensitive data items first, since any damage to them can hinder the functions of critical applications that use the database. By prioritizing the data items, delay in the transaction execution time is reduced in addition to mitigating insider threats arising from write operations. The developed algorithms have been implemented on a simulated database and the results show that the models mitigate insider threats arising from write operations effectively...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{appeared}} in the Proceedings of the 9 th European Conference on Information Warfare and Security, July 2010, Thessaloniki, Greece. Warfare without damage {{has always been a}} dream of military planners. Traditional warfare usually leaves persistent side effects in the form of dead and injured people and damaged infrastructure. An appealing feature of cyberwarfare is that it could be more ethical than traditional warfare because its damage could be less and more easily repairable. <b>Damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>data</b> and programs (albeit not physical hardware) can be repaired by rewriting over damaged bits with correct data. However, there are practical difficulties in ensuring that cyberattacks minimize unreversible collateral damage while still being easily repairable by the attacker and not by the victim. We discuss four techniques by which cyberattacks can be potentially reversible. One technique is reversible cryptography, where the attacker encrypts data or programs to prevent their use, then decrypts them after hostilities have ceased. A second technique is to obfuscate the victim's computer systems in a reversible way. A third technique to withhold key data from the victim, while caching it to enable quick restoration on cessation of hostilities. A fourth technique is to deceive the victim so that think they mistakenly think they are being hurt, then reveal the deception at the conclusion of hostilities. We also discuss incentives to use reversible attacks such as legality, better proportionality, lower reparations, and easier ability to use third parties. As an example, we discuss aspects of the recent cyberattacks on Georgia...|$|E

For my observation, it can be concluded that the OSPF routing protocol is very good in finding the shortest path to send data by finding the smallest cost among the link in the network.

Whilst some may view cyberstalking as an extension of conventional stalking, we believe cyberstalking should be regarded as an entirely new form of deviant behaviour. It is not surprising that cyberstalking is sometimes thought of as a trivial problem. A number of writers and researchers have suggested that cyberstalking and associated activities are of little genuine concern. Koch (2000), for example, goes as far as accusing those interested in cyberstalking as promoting hysteria over a problem that may be minuscule or even imaginary. The impression gained is that cyberstalking represents a relatively small problem where victims seldom suffer any real harm. Whilst there are no genuinely reliable statistics {{that can be used to}} determine how common cyberstalking incidents are, a great deal of evidence is available to show that cyberstalking is a significant and growing problem (Griffiths et al, 1998). For instance, CyberAngels (a well-known Internet safety organization) receives some 500 complaints of cyberstalking each day, of which up to 100 represent legitimate cases (Dean, 2000). Another Internet safety organization (Working to Halt Online Abuse) reports receiving an average of 100 cases per week (WHOA, 2001). To highlight the types of cyberstalking behaviours that take place and some of the major issues facing criminal law, we briefly examine four high profile cases of cyberstalking (adapted from Bocij and MacFarlane, 2002 b) ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Masters Diploma (Information Technology)) [...] Cape Technikon, Cape Town, 1994 Computer virus {{programs}} are generally {{perceived to be}} a threat to the information stored by computer users. This research evaluated the impact computer viruses have on information stored by computer users. The emphasis was on the effects of computer viruses rather than on the detail of their operation. The main hypotheses involved {{the question of whether or}} not computer viruses do pose a threat to the information stored by computer users. The effect of computer viruses on the information of users in industry was measured by sending a questionnaire to 388 companies country-wide. &~ average of 2 l, 5 % of the respondents claimed detrimental effects to information stored on disk due to computer viruses. This and other data was used to guide laboratory experiments on the actual damage done by computer viruses to stored information. A set of test disks was prepared to represent programs and data of a typical PC user in industry. Fifteen different virus programs were used individually to infect the test disks. After each infection, all the test disks were inspected to ascertain <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>data,</b> system and program files as well as to separate disk sectors. The research established that: The damage done by computer viruses to stored information is generally limited to one file or disk area. Where damage to stored information did occur, it was often reversible. Irrational user responses to virus symptoms provide a large potential source for damage to stored information. The availability of master program disks (for program file restoration) and recent, validated data backup is essential to recovery from a computer virus infection. A user can solve most problems caused by virus infections if he has a basic understanding of disk structure, i. e. tracks, sectors, sides, the FAT, etc, and of the use of disk utility programs like Norton Utilities or PCTools. The fact that some of the findings of prominent virus researchers could not be verified, suggests that virus programs could be unstable. Claims regarding the damage inflicted by viruses must be considered to be valid only for a specific copy of the virus under discussion. The importance of using original application software (to minimize the transfer of viruses and to enable program file restoration), regular back-ups (to enable data file restoration) and basic user awareness (infection prevention, symptoms, the use of anti-viral and utility programs, etc.) was emphasized. The average PC user should be able to clear up a virus infection without assistance by following the given disinfection procedure. Suggestions for further study include virus origins, generations, mutations, multiple infections, and the effect of viruses on computer networks...|$|E

40|$|For {{improving}} {{the security and}} privacy of data storage, a novel model based on code division multiple access, called PNCD-DS, is proposed {{for dealing with the}} problem of resources sharing in a storage area network (SAN). This technology differs from existing such as space or time division multiple access, it has some essential features for ensuring the security and privacy of user's information and/or data. Through decreasing the information intensity by multi times during user's data storage and then recovering it normal when scan, the method makes the interference from other users or <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> the <b>data</b> weaken enormously. Therefore, <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> some extent in some local area of SAN will not destroy the integrity of saved data.
