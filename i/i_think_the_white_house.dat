"You {{would be}} of no use on board," [...] the Prince said, [...] "but assuredly you could be of use in {{carrying}} messages, and letting me know frequently, from your own report, how matters are going on. I heard yesterday that the Fan Fan is now fitted out. You shall take the command of her. I {{will give you a}} letter to the boatswain, who is at present in charge, saying that I have placed her wholly under your orders. You will, of course, live on board. You will be chiefly at Chatham and Sheerness. If you call early to-morrow I will have a letter prepared for you, addressed to all captains holding commands in <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Squadron, bidding them to acquaint you, whensoever you go on board, with all particulars of how matters have been pushed forward, and to give you a list of all things lacking. Then, twice a week you will sail up to town, and report to me, or, should there be any special news at other times, send it to me by a mounted messenger. Mr. Pepys, the secretary, is a diligent and hard-working man, but he cannot see to everything, and Albemarle so pushes him that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>White</b> Squadron does not get a fair share of attention; but if I can go to him with your reports in hand, I may succeed in getting what is necessary done." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{deregulation}} of the energy retail market {{is an important one}} and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> much-anticipated Energy <b>White</b> Paper, released by Energy Minister Martin Ferguson yesterday, does well to emphasise it. The last round of electricity market reform focused on the wholesale market rather than on the retail market. The idea was to introduce competition into the generation sector and to empower independent regulators to approve tariffs for the natural monopoly network operators. However, by not allowing market forces to determine retail tariffs, the reform process was incomplete and many problems of waste and inefficiency remain. In all states but Victoria, the retail price of residential electricity is set by government agencies rather than by competing retail firms. Such government control of the retail market always leads to a politically motivated price setting regime. In other words, the electricity price is used as a political tool...|$|R

Luckily a great part of the negroes were turned out of the town a fortnight ago. There are only two hundred soldiers here, and about as many white volunteers--little enough to defend the place if they attack us. No doubt they chose the moment because there is not a French war-ship of any kind in port. However, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that all <b>the</b> <b>white</b> women and children are on board the ships. They are all crowded. I have about twenty on board the brig, and have rigged up a sail as an awning, and on such a warm night as this they will sleep better there than they would in a cabin. I can assure you that there was the greatest satisfaction when you were seen coming in. Several of the captains had talked of towing their vessels out three or four miles into the bay, but {{as soon as it was}} certain that you were an armed ship, the idea was given up, as many of them were only half-laden; and it was felt that, of whatever nationality you were, you would prevent the negroes from coming off in boats to murder the women and children. Of course I did not know that it was you until I made out your figure from the shore, but as soon as I did so, I told all I knew that they need not trouble about the safety of those on board ship, for I could answer for it that you would not hesitate to turn your guns on any boats that went out to attack them." ...|$|R
