5000|$|A {{demarcation}} point extension, or <b>demarc</b> extension is the transmission path originating from the interface of the access provider's {{side of a}} {{demarcation point}} within a premises and ending at the termination point prior to the interface of the edge Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). This may include in-segment equipment, media converters and patch cords as required to complete the circuit's transmission path to the edge CPE. A <b>demarc</b> extension is more correctly termed [...] "Service Interface Extension", and may also {{be referred to as}} inside wiring, extended <b>demarc,</b> circuit extension, CPE cabling, riser cabling or DMARC extension.|$|E
50|$|DEMARCs that handle both {{telephony}} and IT {{fiber optic}} internet lines {{often do not}} look like the ones pictured above. In many places several customers share one central <b>DEMARC</b> for a commercial or strip mall setting. Usually a <b>DEMARC</b> will be located indoors if it is serving {{more than a single}} customer. This may impede access. Outdoor ones provide easier access, without disturbing other tenants, but call for weatherproofing and punching through a wall for each new addition of wires and service.|$|E
50|$|Typically indoor <b>DEMARC's</b> will {{be easily}} {{identified}} by a patch panel of telephone wires {{on the wall}} next to a series of boxes with RJ48 jacks for T-1 lines. Each business or individual customer can expect their own separate box for internet access T-1 lines.|$|R
50|$|Demarcation {{point is}} {{sometimes}} abbreviated as <b>demarc,</b> DMARC, or similar. The term MPOE (minimum or main point of entry) is synonymous, {{with the added}} implication that it occurs {{as soon as possible}} upon entering the customer premises. A network interface device often serves as the demarcation point.|$|E
50|$|A <b>demarc</b> {{extension}} {{became an}} important factor to consider in a building's telecommunications infrastructure after the 1984 deregulation of AT&T {{as well as the}} supplemental FCC rulings of 1991, 1996 and 1997. Preceding these rulings, the Bell System Companies held a monopoly and did not allow an interconnection with third party equipment. The incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) and other local access providers are now mandated by federal law to provide a point where the operational control or ownership changes. This separation between the local access provider and the end user/subscriber is called the demarcation point within a facility (typically a short distance from the minimum point of entry). This then becomes the responsibility of the end user to extend their service to the CPE location within a facility to provide connectivity for service, requiring a service interface extension, or otherwise called a <b>demarc</b> extension.|$|E
50|$|Customer-premises {{equipment}} or customer-provided equipment (CPE) is any terminal and associated equipment located at a subscriber's premises and {{connected with a}} carrier's telecommunication channel at the demarcation point ("demarc"). The <b>demarc</b> is a point established in a building or complex to separate customer equipment from the equipment located in either the distribution infrastructure or central office of the communications service provider.|$|E
5000|$|A can wrench is {{a wrench}} made {{to open a}} {{telephone}} distribution terminal also called a telco can or demarcation point box. One end of the can wrench is a 7/16 inch hex socket used for recessed fasteners on closures, and the other end is a 3/8 inch hex socket for use on binding posts. The wrench is {{also referred to as}} a 216C tool which was the Bell System specification version. They are often insulated against electric shock. The hex socket on each end is a thin wall thickness to allow the outside diameter to be placed into the tight recessed access often found on telco cans and <b>demarc</b> boxes.|$|E
50|$|Lower Price Hill is in {{the river}} valley to the southwest, {{comprising}} 0.57 sq mi. It was known as Eighth and State until recently, getting that name from the major intersection at its center. The 2010 Census lists the population as 1217, though it does not clearly <b>demarc</b> the line between Lower Price Hill and Queensgate, the neighboring industrial area that has little to no population. As of 2010, 22.0% of the households had one person, 78.0% had two people or more living in the home. The 2010 Census lists 61.5% of the residents as white and 25.8% as black with the Hispanic population listed at 12.3%.

40|$|We have {{recently}} developed a computational approach for hierarchical, genome-based classification of viruses {{of a family}} (<b>DEmARC).</b> In <b>DEmARC,</b> virus clusters are delimited objectively by devising a universal family-wide threshold on intra-cluster genetic divergence of viruses that is specific for each level of the classification. Here, we apply <b>DEmARC</b> {{to a set of}} 56 filoviruses with complete genome sequences and compare the resulting classification to the ICTV taxonomy of the family Filoviridae. We find in total six candidate taxon levels two of which correspond to the species and genus ranks of the family. At these two levels, the six filovirus species and two genera officially recognized by ICTV, as well as a seventh tentative species for Lloviu virus and prototyping a third genus, are reproduced. <b>DEmARC</b> lends the highest possible support for these two as well as the four other levels, implying that the actual number of valid taxon levels remains uncertain and the choice of levels for filovirus species and genera is arbitrary. Based on our experience with other virus families, we conclude that the current sampling of filovirus genomic sequences needs to be considerably expanded in order to resolve these uncertainties in the framework of genetics-based classification...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{prevalence}} of use and need for dental prostheses (UNDP) by individuals at age 24 and their life-course determinants. A representative sample (n = 720) of all 5914 births occurring in Pelotas in 1982 were prospectively investigated, and the UNDP were assessed in 2006. Exploratory variables included demographic and socio-economic, oral health, and dental service utilization patterns during the life-course. The prevalence of UNDP was 2. 1 % and 29. 7 %, respectively. Multivariable Poisson regression analysis showed that low socio-economic status through the life-course [Prevalence Ratio (PR) = 1. 56 (95 % CI: 1. 08 - 2. 26) ], lower maternal schooling in childhood [PR 2. 79 (1. 34 - 5. 79) ], no oral hygiene instruction by a dentist at age 15 [PR 1. 64 (1. 11 - 2. 41) ], and caries presence at age 15 (high DMFT tertile) [PR 2. 90 (1. 98 - 4. 24) ] were associated with prosthetic treatment needs. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} life-course socio-economic, behavioral, and clinical determinants are associated with the need for dental prostheses. M. B. Correa, M. A. Peres, K. G.

40|$|Lower {{dental caries}} {{experience}} has been observed in children and teenagers {{with the presence of}} black stains on dental structures. However, none of the previous investigations were population-based studies or adjusted the analysis for potential confounders. This study assessed the prevalence of black stains at the age of 5 in a population-based birth cohort from Pelotas, Brazil and investigated the association between black stains and dental caries. A total of 1, 129 children from the 2004 Pelotas birth cohort were examined at age 5, and their mothers were interviewed at their households. Dental examinations included a search for black stains and dental caries on the primary dentition through the dmf-s index. The mothers’ questionnaire comprised data on demographic, social, and behavior aspects. Prevalence of black stains was 3. 5 % (95 % CI 2. 5 – 4. 7) and the prevalence of dental caries was 48. 4 % (95 % CI 45. 4 – 51. 4). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between black stains and dental caries. Adjusted analysis revealed that the presence of black stains was associated with lower levels of dental caries (OR = 0. 51; 95 % CI 0. 26 – 0. 99). The {{results of the present study}} suggest that black stains are a protective factor for dental caries development. C. C. França-Pinto, M. S. Cenci, M. B. Correa, A. R. Romano, M. A. Peres, K. G.

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the prevalence of dental pain in preschool children and its association with socioeconomic, demographic, clinical, and behavior variables. SUBJECT AND METHODS: The study was nested in a population-based birth cohort from Pelotas, Brazil, started in 2004. A sample of 1, 129 children aged 5 years was dentally examined, and their mothers were interviewed. Exploratory variables included demographics, socioeconomic status, mothers’ oral health status and associated behaviors, and caries in primary teeth. Data were analyzed using multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of dental pain was 16. 5 % (95 % CI: 14. 4 – 18. 8). Multivariate analysis showed that dark-skinned children (prevalence ratio, PR = 1. 6, 95 % CI: 1. 1 – 2. 4) from low socioeconomic level (PR 1. 9, 1. 2 – 3. 0) whose mothers had less than 4 years of education (PR 1. 9, 1. 0 – 3. 6), from mothers with less than 10 teeth in at least one arch (PR 1. 7, 1. 2 – 2. 5) and less than 10 in two arches (PR 1. 6, 1. 0 – 2. 6), and those with high caries prevalence at the age of 5 years (PR 4. 8, 3. 3 – 7. 1) were more likely to experience dental pain. Conclusions: Unrestored caries is the main factor associated with dental pain in childhood. Socioeconomic aspects and family context in which dental pain occurs should also be taken into account when dental pain preventive measures are implemented. G. F. Boeira, M. B. Correa, K. G.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} posterior restorations placed in young adults, investigating {{the association between}} social determinants experienced during the life course {{and the quality of}} tooth fillings. METHODS: A representative sample (n= 720) of all 5914 individuals who were born in Pelotas in 1982 was prospectively investigated, and posterior restorations were assessed at 24 years of age. Exploratory variables included demographic and socioeconomic, oral health and dental service payment mode during the life course. Tooth-related variables (type of tooth, material and size of cavity) were also analysed. RESULTS: Multilevel logistic regression models showed that individuals who were always poor from birth to age 23 [odds ratio (OR) 2. 35 (1. 38 - 4. 00) ] and whose mothers had less years of education at their birth (OR 2. 60 (1. 44 - 4. 68)) were with unsatisfactory restorations in posterior teeth more often. In addition, caries presence at age 15 (high decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) tertile) (OR 1. 95 (1. 25 - 3. 03)) and cavities with four or more surfaces (OR 18. 67 (9. 25 - 37. 68)) were associated with the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals {{play an important role in}} restoration failures, reinforcing the need for preventive dental strategies and public policies to reduce inequalities as a major topic of oral health. In addition, the size of cavity appears as the most important determinant for restoration failure. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Individual socioeconomic characteristics were associated with failure in posterior restorations in detriment of other clinical variables such as restorative material and type of tooth.

40|$|AIM: To {{systematically}} review epidemiological articles assessing traumatic dental injuries (TDI) rates {{according to}} the physical activity habits and nutritional status. METHODS: A search was conducted using PubMed, ISI, Scopus, SciELO, LILACS, and gray literature in Brazilian Theses Databank. We searched for dental trauma, traumatic dental injuries, tooth injuries, tooth fractures, physical activity, motor activity, exercise, sedentary lifestyle, sports, obesity, body mass index (BMI), overweight, and fatness. Databases were searched in duplicate from their earliest records until 2012. Additional studies were identified by searching bibliographies of the articles. Two reviewers performed data extraction and analyzed study procedural quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews were followed. RESULTS: We found 1159 articles, of whom 14 reports involving 13 studies were selected. One article was a birth cohort, one had a case-control design, {{and the others were}} cross-sectional. The quality of evidence varied across the studies and was high (9) in 3. Eleven of the studies included assessed influence of nutritional status: five show a positive association between dental trauma and overweight and six do not show any association. Regarding physical activity level, five studies assessed its effect on trauma occurrence: two detected that physical activity acts as a protective factor and two that physical active increases the risk of dental injuries, and one showed no differences in TDI occurrence. Physical activity estimated from questionnaires and BMI were the most frequently used measures, but methodological differences prevent the comparison of results. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that no truly causal relationship exists between dental trauma and physical activity and nutritional status. Due to the relatively low level of evidence currently present, studies with more robust design, for example, prospective cohort should address this question, especially in view of the epidemic of obesity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Evaluation of the {{frequency}} and need for treatment of dental trauma is critical for both planning and establishing dental services and preventive programs. AIM: This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of dental trauma, need for treatment and factors associated with dental visits after an injury. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A multistage sample of children aged 8 - 12 years, from 20 private and public schools in Pelotas/Southern Brazil, was considered. Socioeconomic information was collected from parents, and data regarding traumatic events {{were obtained from the}} children. Clinical examinations were conducted using validated criteria. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were used to assess the factors associated with search for treatment after injury. RESULTS: A total of 1210 children were included, 153 (12. 6 %, 95 % CI 10. 8 - 14. 6) of whom suffered dental trauma, with a total of 175 traumatized teeth. The most frequently observed type of injury was enamel fracture, affecting 129 (73. 7 %) teeth, of which 107 did not require restorative treatment. A total of 68 (38. 8 %) teeth required care, of which 24 (13. 7 %) received treatment. Of the children who recalled the trauma, 39 (36. 5 %) sought treatment, which was significantly associated with both higher maternal education (OR 2. 75; 95 % CI 1. 18 - 6. 41) and trauma severity (OR 7. 71; 95 % CI 3. 17 - 18. 75). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of traumatic injuries was relatively high in this population. Although most of the traumatized teeth did not require treatment, dental care was neglected, as most of the children were not taken to a dentist for evaluation. Also, there was a considerable demand for treatment, most of them of low complexity. Special attention should be given to children whose mothers have completed fewer years of education, as the mother's level of education was an important predictor of evaluation by a dentist after injury.
