Three configurations with two baffle plates and a solid square obstacle, at different axial locations from the bottom ignition centre are examined. Numerical calculations of explosion generated pressure histories; flame characteristics such as structure, position, speed and acceleration are validated against published experimental data.

40|$|We report {{deflagration}} {{rates on}} EDC- 37 at high pressures. Experiments are conducted using the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory High Pressure Strand Burner (HPSB) apparatus. The HPSB contains a <b>deflagrating</b> sample {{in a small}} volume, high pressure chamber.

40|$|The {{response}} {{of a system}} containing an energetic material (EM) to an abnormal thermal environment is termed cookoff. To predict the violence of reaction of confined energetic materials during cookoff requires {{a description of the}} relevant physical processes that occur on time scales Ranging from days to submicroseconds. The time-to-ignition can be characterized accurately using heat transfer with chemistry and quasistatic mechanics. After ignition the energetic material deflagrates on a millisecond time scale. During this time the mechanical processes become dynamic. If the confinement survives burning then accelerated deflagration can lead to shock formation and deflagration to detonation transition. The focus of this work is the dynamic combustion regime in the millisecond time domain. Due to the mathematical stiffness of the chemistry equations and the prohibitively fine spatial resolution requirements needed to resolve the structure of the flame, an interface tracking approach is used to propagate the burn front. Demonstrative calculations are presented that illustrate the dynamic interaction of the <b>deflagrating</b> energetic material with its confinement...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{vertically}} resolved hydrodynamic simulations of a laterally propagating, <b>deflagrating</b> flame {{in the thin}} helium ocean of a rotating accreting neutron star. We use a new hydrodynamics solver tailored {{to deal with the}} large discrepancy in horizontal and vertical length scales typical of neutron star oceans, and which filters out sound waves that would otherwise limit our timesteps. We find that the flame moves horizontally with velocities of order $ 10 ^ 5 $ cm s$^{- 1 }$, crossing the ocean in few seconds, broadly consistent with the rise times of Type I X-ray bursts. We address the open question of what drives flame propagation, and find that heat is transported from burning to unburnt fuel by a combination of top-to-bottom conduction and mixing driven by a baroclinic instability. The speed of the flame propagation is therefore a sensitive function of the ocean conductivity and spin: we explore this dependence for an astrophysically relevant range of parameters and find that in general flame propagation is faster for slower rotation and higher conductivity.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{results from}} numerical calculations using the large eddy simulation (LES) technique of <b>deflagrating</b> flames inside a laboratory scale explosion chamber. The LES technique {{has been proved}} to be an extremely powerful and highly reliable modelling tool for turbulent reacting Flows. Two reaction rate models are used to examine the flame structure and speed, and the generation of overpressure inside the combustion chamber. Both models are formulated ba ed on modified formulations of the flame surface density (FSD). The test case used for model validation is an open-end rectangular combustion chamber with three baffles plates and one solid square obstacle as presented in this paper. A stoichiometric propane/air air mixture is used here for all calculations, and model validation is carried out against experimental measurements. Results are presented in the paper for the generated over pressure, reaction rate and the flame structure, location, speed and acceleration. It was concluded that careful selection of the model parameter is needed in order to predict the correct flame structure and speed. Details of the two models used together with results are presented and discussed in terms of different flame parameters...|$|E
40|$|Analytical and {{numerical}} {{calculations of}} the structure and burning rate of a <b>deflagrating</b> porous energetic material are presented for the limiting case of merged condensed and gas-phase reaction zones. The reaction scheme is modeled by a global two-step mechanism, applicable to certain types of degraded nitramine propellants and consisting of sequential condensed and gaseous steps. Taking into account important effects due to multiphase flow and exploiting the limit of large activation energies, a theoretical analysis may be developed based on activation-energy asymptotics. For steady, planar deflagration, this leads to an eigenvalue problem for the inner reaction-zone, the solution of which determines the burning rate. Numerical solutions give a reasonably complete description of the dependence {{of the structure}} and burning rate on the various parameters in the problem, and show excellent agreement with analytical results that are obtained in a more limited parameter regime in {{which most of the}} heat release is produced by the condensed-phase reaction and the porosity of the solid is small. These calculations indicate the significant influences of two-phase flow and the multiphase, multi-step chemistry on the deflagration structure and the burning rate, and thus serve to define an important parameter regime that supports the intrusion of the primary gas flame into the two-phase condensed decomposition region at the propellant surface...|$|E

The definitive version is available at: [URL] this study, simulations of propagating turbulent premixed <b>deflagrating</b> flames past built in solid obstructions in a laboratory scale explosion chamber has been carried out with the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) technique. The design of the chamber allows for up to three baffle plates to be positioned {{in the path of the}} propagating flame, rendering different configurations, hence generating turbulence and modifying the structure of the reaction zone. Five important configurations are studied to understand the feedback mechanism between the flame-flow interactions and the burning rate. In LES, the sub-grid scale (SGS) reaction rate should be accounted for by an appropriate model which can essentially capture the physics. The present work has been carried by using the flame surface density (FSD) model for sub-grid scale reaction rate. The influence of the flow on turbulence and flame 2 propagation as a result of the in-built solid obstructions is also examined. The impact of the number and the position of such baffle plates on the generated overpressure, flame speed and structure are studied. Results from the simulations are compared with experimental data for five configurations and they show good agreement...|$|E
