25|$|In addition, the County of Tyrol and Duchy of Bavaria {{went to war}} in {{the late}} 15th century. Bavaria demanded money from Tyrol that had been loaned on the {{collateral}} of Tyrolean lands. In 1490, the two nations demanded that Maximilian <b>I</b> <b>step</b> in to mediate the dispute. In response, he assumed control of Tyrol and its debt. Because Tyrol had no law code at this time, the nobility freely expropriated money from the populace, which caused the royal palace in Innsbruck to fester with corruption. After taking control, Maximilian instituted immediate financial reform. In order to symbolize his new wealth and power, he built the Golden Roof, a canopy overlooking the town center of Innsbruck, from which to watch the festivities celebrating his assumption of rule over Tyrol. The canopy is made entirely from golden shingles. Gaining theoretical control of Tyrol for the Habsburgs was of strategic importance because it linked the Swiss Confederacy to the Habsburg-controlled Austrian lands, which facilitated some imperial geographic continuity.|$|E
