5|$|Because the South Korean {{forces had}} {{suffered}} nearly 45,000 casualties {{at the end}} of 1950, most of the South Korean units were composed of raw recruits with little combat training. After <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> front just days before the battle, General J. Lawton Collins, the US Army Chief of Staff, concluded that most of the ROK formations were only fit for outpost duties. At the same time, the US Eighth Army was also suffering from low morale due to its earlier defeats, and most of its soldiers were anticipating an evacuation from Korea. The Eighth Army's lack of will to fight and to maintain contact with Chinese forces resulted in a lack of information on Chinese troop movements and intentions. After <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> front on December 27, Ridgway ordered the US I and IX Corps to organize a new defensive line around Koyang to Uijeongbu, called the Seoul Bridgehead line, to cover the Han River crossings in case the UN forces were forced to evacuate Seoul.|$|E

5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Black Osprey, still registered in the neutral-United States, was seized by British authorities on 6 September and detained at Weymouth. After carefully <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> ship for any contraband, the British released the ship after a week. However, on 31 October, the British again seized Black Osprey, and had not yet released her by 8 November, when the U.S. State Department released a list of 40 American ships that had been detained by belligerents.|$|E

5|$|FRELIMO attack {{groups had}} {{also begun to}} grow in size to include over 100 {{soldiers}} in certain cases, and the insurgents also began to accept women fighters into their ranks. On either October 10 or October 11, 1966, on returning to Tanzania after <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> front lines, Filipe Samuel Magaia was shot dead by Lourenço Matola, a fellow FRELIMO guerrilla who {{was said to be}} in the employ of the Portuguese.|$|E
5|$|Future space {{missions}} carrying dogs {{would be}} designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.|$|E
5|$|Generals Alfred Keller and Adolf Galland had {{scheduled}} {{an inspection}} at Achmer {{for the afternoon}} of 7November1944. Galland had already visited Kommando Nowotny several times and was deeply concerned over the high attrition rate and meager success achieved by the Me 262. After <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> two airfields at Achmer and Hesepe, {{he stayed in the}} Penterknapp barracks discussing the problems of the past few weeks. Several pilots openly expressed their doubts as to the readiness of the Me 262for combat operations.|$|E

5|$|Prevented {{from flying}} further combat {{missions}} for propaganda reasons, {{at the age}} of 28 Mölders was appointed Inspector of Fighters. He was <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe units in the Crimea when he was ordered to Berlin to attend the state funeral of Ernst Udet, a Luftwaffe general and World War I flying ace. On the flight to Berlin, the aircraft in which he was traveling as a passenger attempted an emergency landing due to an engine failure. It crashed at Breslau, killing Mölders and two others.|$|E
5|$|The Duke of York's {{passion for}} all things naval and {{military}} rubbed off on young Churchill. Often accompanying the Duke <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> troops in the royal parks, {{it was not long}} before the boy had set his heart on becoming a soldier himself. On 14 September 1667 (O.S.), he obtained a commission as Ensign in the King's Own Company in the 1st Guards, later to become the Grenadier Guards.|$|E
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E

5|$|While Washington was <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> terrain to {{determine}} where {{it was best to}} station his troops, messengers alerted him that the British were advancing. Returning to his headquarters, he ordered the 2nd Connecticut Regiment under Joseph Spencer out to slow the British advance, and sent Haslet and the 1st Delaware Regiment, along with Alexander McDougall's brigade (Rudolphus Ritzema's 3rd New York Regiment, Charles Webb's 19th Continental Regiment, William Smallwood's 1st Maryland Regiment, and the 1st New York Regiment and 2nd New York Regiments) to reinforce Chatterton Hill.|$|E
5|$|Comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) must {{be present}} to {{diagnose}} acne. In their absence, an appearance {{similar to that}} of acne would suggest a different skin disorder. Microcomedones (the precursor to blackheads and whiteheads) are not {{visible to the naked eye}} when <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> skin and can only be seen with a microscope. There are many features that may indicate a person's acne vulgaris is sensitive to hormonal influences. Historical and physical clues that may suggest hormone-sensitive acne include onset between ages 20 and 30; worsening the week before a woman's menstrual cycle; acne lesions predominantly over the jawline and chin; and inflammatory/nodular acne lesions.|$|E
5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the scarcity of water sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E

5|$|In 1955 Pei's group took a {{step toward}} {{institutional}} independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed architectural models. They took on the Kips Bay residential area {{on the east side of}} Manhattan, where Pei set up Kips Bay Towers, two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.|$|E
5|$|In early June 1916, the Canadian Corps {{was again}} posted to {{trenches}} around the Belgian town of Ypres. The new {{commander of the}} Canadian Corps, Julian Byng, was <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> Corps positions {{in front of a}} German-held rise named Mount Sorrel and noted that the Canadian troops were overlooked by German positions and under constant danger of enemy fire. The Germans also seemed to be digging new sap trenches which implied that an assault was intended. Byng ordered Mercer to make a reconnaissance of the front line and draw up a plan to overrun the more dangerous German positions in a local attack. Mercer complied on the 2 June, conducting a standard inspection of front line Canadian trenches at 08:30.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November, Louisiana carried President Theodore Roosevelt from Piney Point, Maryland to Panama, {{where the}} Panama Canal was being built. After <b>inspecting</b> <b>the</b> {{progress}} of construction, Roosevelt boarded Louisiana {{and made a}} visit to Puerto Rico to examine the new government building there before continuing on to Piney Point, arriving on 26 November. Over {{the course of the}} following year, the ship made a series of cruises to American ports, including New Orleans and Norfolk, and visits to Havana and Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. During this period, she also took part in training exercises off New England.|$|E
