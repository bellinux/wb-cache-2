5|$|Evidence from {{excavated}} Liao burial sites {{indicates that}} animistic or shamanistic practices were fused with Buddhism and other practices in marriage and burial ceremonies.

5|$|There are <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> D. horneri {{possessing}} integumentary sensory organs, possibly used in touch, modulation of precise jaw movements, temperature reading, and prey detection.

5|$|Delhi {{has hosted}} many major {{international}} sporting events, {{including the first}} and also the ninth Asian Games, the 2010 Hockey World Cup, the 2010 Commonwealth Games and the 2011 Cricket World Cup. Delhi lost bidding for the 2014 Asian Games, and considered making a bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics. However, sports minister Manohar Singh Gill later stated that funding infrastructure would come before a 2020 bid. There are <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> a possible 2028 bid.|$|E
5|$|One {{class of}} honest signal is the aposematic warning signal, {{generally}} visual, given by poisonous or dangerous {{animals such as}} wasps, poison dart frogs, and pufferfish. Warning signals are honest <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> noxious prey, because conspicuousness evolves in tandem with noxiousness. Thus, the brighter and more conspicuous the organism, the more toxic it usually is. The most common and effective colours are red, yellow, black and white.|$|E
30|$|In our institution, solitary mucosal (in situ) cancer <b>of</b> {{duodenum}} was <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) because {{lymph node}} dissection {{would not be}} necessary. Multiple mucosal cancers which are difficult to treat by ESD are considered as <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> PSTD. On the other hand, advanced duodenal cancer which invades more than submucosal layer is considered as <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> pancreatoduodenectomy because systemic lymph node dissection is necessary.|$|R

50|$|Two {{versions}} of this measure exist: the global and the local. The global version was designed to give an overall <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the clustering in the network, whereas the local gives an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the embeddedness of single nodes.|$|R
5|$|The {{carousel}} {{was commissioned}} by William Hubbs, who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917. Built on a Mangel-Illions mechanism, it used animals carved by the Dentzel carousel company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, sometime before 1900. The carousel was assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company in 1917. It was probably not the first carousel in the park, as there are <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> a previous ride that came from Hartford, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|The icebergs' melting caused {{extensive}} {{amounts of}} fresh water {{to be added to}} the North Atlantic.

5|$|The {{presence}} of the disease can be confirmed with a genetic test.

An additional patient with the suspected mutation was subsequently found to have NF1, following evaluation of the mother.|$|E

5|$|Weakening of the {{individual}} mandate through his first executive order, which resulted in limiting enforcement of mandate penalties by the IRS.

5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{reliable}} documentation of the demographic impact of the Black Death in Scotland, there are some <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> the immediate effects of the plague. Walter Bower recorded that 24, about a third, of the canons of St. Andrews died during the outbreak. There are also anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Compared with the distribution of population after the later Clearances and the Industrial Revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the River Tay.|$|E

5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he thought there was good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E
5|$|During his Spitsbergen {{visits with}} Prince Albert in 1898 and 1899, Bruce had {{detected}} {{the presence of}} coal, gypsum and possibly oil. In the summers of 1906 and 1907 he again accompanied the Prince to the archipelago, with {{the primary purpose of}} surveying and mapping Prince Charles Foreland, an island unvisited during the earlier voyages. Here Bruce found further deposits of coal, and <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> iron. On the basis of these finds, Bruce set up a mineral prospecting company, the Scottish Spitsbergen Syndicate, in July 1909.|$|E
5|$|Education in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} education within the modern borders of Scotland, between {{the departure of the}} Romans from Britain in the fifth century, until the establishment of the Renaissance late fifteenth century and early sixteenth century. Few sources on Scottish education survived the Medieval era. In the early Middle Ages, Scotland was an oral society, with verbal rather than literary education. Though there are <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> a Gaelic education system similar to that of Ireland, few details are known. The establishment of Christianity from the sixth century brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools.|$|E
30|$|CAI {{gives an}} <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> ion {{exchange}} between ions in the groundwater and their host rock (Sastri 1994). A negative CAI value is an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> exchange between Na + K with Ca and Mg. If {{there is no}} exchange between these parameters, a positive CAI value would be recorded. All the groundwaters {{in the study area}} recorded positive CAI values and therefore gives an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the occurrence of Base Exchange between Na and K in water with Ca and Mg in the host rocks.|$|R
