They [...] ruined my last game as a college football player." [...] The Play cost Stanford an invitation to the Hall of Fame Classic, in addition to a winning season, and Elway completed his college career having never played in a bowl game. Geiger said that the loss cost Elway the Heisman Trophy. Elway would nevertheless enjoy a tremendously successful NFL career, winning two Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos, and was inducted into the Pro Football and College Football Halls of Fame. Years later, Elway came to terms with The Play, stating that [...] "each year <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> funnier." ...|$|E

With two minutes remaining in the game, Stanford was down 19-17 and had 4th-and-17 on their own 13-yard line. Elway completed a 29-yard pass and drove the ball downfield to the 35-yard line, where Mark Harmon kicked {{what appeared to be the}} winning field goal. However, the clock had four seconds remaining, so Stanford had to kick off. What followed is now simply known as [...] "The Play", in which Cal players lateraled the ball, rugby-style, five times – two of them controversial – and scored a touchdown to win the game, 25-20. Elway was bitter about the game afterward, stating that the officials [...] "ruined my last game as a college football player." [...] Stanford athletics director Andy Geiger said the loss cost Elway the Heisman Trophy.
