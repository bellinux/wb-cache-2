25|$|Fish as food, {{especially}} Pacific salmon (or in some places, non-salmon) {{species are}} primary main subsistence food for Yup'ik Eskimos. Both food and fish (and salmon) called neqa (sg) neqet (pl) in Yup'ik. Also for salmon called neqpik ~ neqpiaq (sg) neqpiit ~ neqpiat (pl) in Yup'ik, means literally “real food”. But, main food for <b>Iñupiaq</b> Eskimos is meat of whale and caribou (both food and meat called niqi in <b>Iñupiaq,</b> also for meat called niqipiaq “real food”).|$|E
25|$|In October 2016, a city {{referendum}} {{renamed the}} city from Barrow to its traditional <b>Iñupiaq</b> name, Utqiaġvik. The name change officially went into effect on December 1, 2016.|$|E
25|$|Ilairutaq or Yukon-style parka (ilairutaq in Yup'ik) {{is a type}} of {{traditional}} Yup’ik parka of a design said to be borrowed from the northern Malimiut <b>Inupiaq</b> people via the Yukon area.|$|E
25|$|The {{neighbours}} of the Yup'ik Eskimos are the <b>Iñupiaq</b> Eskimo to the north, Aleutized Alutiiq ~ Sugpiaq Eskimos to the south, and Alaskan Athabaskans, such as Yup'ikized Holikachuk and Deg Hit’an, non-Yup'ikized Koyukon and Dena’ina, to the east.|$|E
25|$|The Iñupiat are the Inuit of Alaska's Northwest Arctic and North Slope boroughs and the Bering Straits region, {{including}} the Seward Peninsula.

25|$|George Leavitt Sr. died at Queen's Hospital in Honolulu on March 1, 1925. Today Oliver Leavitt, an <b>Inupiaq</b> {{descendant}} of Capt. Leavitt, continues to hunt whales in the Beaufort Sea, as did his ancestor. Each {{spring and fall}} Leavitt joins other <b>Inupiaq</b> in the whaling hunts. When the crew captures a bowhead whale, the catch is shared, as is the tribal custom, with the entire community. When not hunting whales, Oliver Leavitt, an Army veteran of the Vietnam War, helped oversee the investments of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, set up by Congress in 1971 under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Leavitt helped lead the fight for the historic legislation in the 1970s. Leavitt lives in Barrow, where he volunteers for the Barrow Volunteer Search & Rescue.|$|E
25|$|The {{position}} of the nukalpiaq was not, however, {{comparable to that of}} the umialik (whaling captain) of the northern and northwestern Alaska <b>Iñupiaq</b> Eskimo. The captain had the power to collect the surplus of the village, and much of the basic production of individual family members, and later redistribute it.|$|E
25|$|Yup’ik cuisine is {{different}} from Alaskan <b>Iñupiaq,</b> Canadian Inuit, and Greenlandic diets. Yup'ik communities varied widely in what foods were available to them, but everyone used similar food processing and food preservation methods, including air drying and smoking, food storage in cold water and oil, fermentation, and freezing. Some foods were eaten raw.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{apparent}} Westernization of Alaskan Eskimos (Yup'ik and <b>Iñupiaq),</b> they have retained {{many of their}} traditional perceptions and responses to life situations. Since the 1960s {{there has been a}} dramatic rise in alcohol abuse, alcoholism, and associated violent behaviors, which have upset family and village life and resulted in physical and psychological injury, death, and imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|The Inuit of Alaska are the Inupiat (from Inuit- people – and piaq/piat real, i.e. 'real people') {{who live}} in the Northwest Arctic Borough, the North Slope Borough and the Bering Straits region. Barrow, the northernmost city in the United States, is in the Inupiat region. Their {{language}} is <b>Iñupiaq</b> (which is the singular form of Inupiat).|$|E
25|$|Both Yup'ik (and Siberian Yupik) and <b>Iñupiaq</b> cuisines {{are also}} known as Eskimo cuisine in Alaska. The oldest, most stable cuisine in North America is found above the Arctic Circle in Alaska. Long {{overlooked}} and pitifully misunderstood, the cuisine's roots lie buried in Eastern Asia, whence <b>Iñupiaq</b> and Yupik ancestors ventured to Siberia, across Beringia, and on to Alaska during the last ice age, 50,000 to 15,000 years ago. The remoteness of the Inupiat and Yupik cultures accounts for their rich and intact food history. The Yupik-Inupiaq split probably occurred about one thousand years ago. Eskimo cuisine do not have hot sauce. Arctic cuisine is not a variation of Western or Eastern cuisines, but is composed of a high-protein diet without grains, supplemented with wild greens, roots and berries. Dietitians consider the diet nutritious and balanced with abundant vitamins, minerals, proteins and valuable unsaturated fats derived from {{a vast array of}} sea and land mammals, fish, fowl, wild plants and berries.|$|E
25|$|The Mathers Museum Collections {{consist of}} over 30,000 objects and 10,000 {{photographs}} representing cultures {{from each of}} the world's inhabited continents. These materials have been collected and curated to serve the museum's primary mission as a teaching museum within a university setting. The ethnology collections strengths include traditional musical instruments, photographs of Native Americans and the Bloomington community, <b>Inupiaq</b> and Yupik Eskimo materials, and Pawnee material culture, among others.|$|E
25|$|While Yupiit were nomadic, the {{abundant}} {{fish and game}} of the Y-K Delta and Bering Sea coastal areas permitted for a more settled life than {{for many of the}} more northerly <b>Iñupiaq</b> people. Under normal conditions, there was little need for interregional travel, as each regional group had access to enough resources within its own territory to be completely self-sufficient. However, fluctuations in animal populations or weather conditions sometimes necessitated travel and trade between regions.|$|E
25|$|Sewing Bag or sewing box, sewing case (kakivik in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, kakiwig in Cup'ig) {{which held}} a woman's needles, thimble, sinew thread, small knife, and whetstone. A woman's ability to sew and repair {{clothing}} {{was critical to}} her husband's success {{as well as the}} whole family's survival. A girl could only become a wife after she learned to sew. Men sewed repairs for themselves while out hunting. <b>Iñupiaq</b> and Yup’ik sewing kits epitomize the economy and thoughtfulness of Eskimo ingenuity with materials.|$|E
25|$|Capt. George Baker Leavitt Sr. (18601925) was a Maine-born mariner who captained several whaling vessels out of New Bedford, Massachusetts. The steam whalers captained by Leavitt {{were active}} in the whaling fishery off the Alaska North Slope, where Leavitt met and married an <b>Inupiaq</b> woman. The mariner befriended many early Arctic explorers, whom he {{replenished}} with supplies and provided transportation to, as well as assisted in Arctic exploration. Leavitt Island in the Beaufort Sea's Harrison Bay is named for the early New England whaling captain.|$|E
25|$|The museum {{included}} displays {{that demonstrate}} {{the daily lives}} of the Inuit and Eskimos, primarily the <b>Inupiaq</b> and Yupik Eskimos. These included exhibits on the clothing and art work. Artifacts include ivory carvings, parkas, jackets made of seal, wolf, and bear skins, a yo-yo-type children's toy, and an anchor made from a whalebone. Other items in the collection include ropes, ivory from mammoth and mastodon tusks, animal bones, ceremonial masks carved from wood or bone, wooden dolls, mukluks, combs carved from ivory, knives, and harpoon heads among others. There is also a dog sled, kayak, snowshoes, baskets, and toys along with artwork. Artwork consists of drawings on sealskins using ink, with some pieces dating to the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Bird skin parka (tamacenaq in Yup'ik) {{made from}} skins of birds of the Alcidae, Anatidae, Gaviidae, and Laridae families. Bird skins make {{very good and}} warm parkas. Thick bird skin parkas were ideal winter wear but were also used during cold weather in summer. Yupik (Yup'ik, Siberian Yupik, Sugpiaq ~ Alutiiq) and Inuit (<b>Inupiaq)</b> Eskimo seamstresses had {{regional}} variations in bird skin preparation techniques and bird skin parka styles and bird skin clothing-production techniques. Bird skin parkas are rarely made today and the skill is quickly disappearing among skin sewers in their region. During the 19th century, many Yup'iks along the coast between the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers wore bird skins. Every year, one could afford to make a bird skin parka because birds returned in such abundance. A plump Yup'ik baby trussed up in eider skin smiled from a warm, dry, cushioned world.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 Hibbard-Swenson Company {{chartered}} {{the newly}} built motor schooner King & Winge to carry relief {{supplies to the}} Belvedere and complete the normal trading run. King & Winge became stuck in the ice near Point Barrow and bent her propeller. The ship was extricated by the revenue cutter Bear on August 22. They met the Belvedere at Point Barrow, delivered the supplies, took on some crewmen from the Elvira, and subsequently put into at Nome August 30. Bear arrived the same day and reported that its attempt to rescue {{the crew of the}} Karluk from Wrangel Island off the northeast Siberian coast had been thwarted by bad weather, ice and low fuel. Stefansson's former secretary Burt McConnell then requested that King & Winge attempt a rescue; this request was reiterated by Captain Bartlett of the Karluk. Swenson set out for Wrangel Island in the King & Winge with A.P. Jochimsen as Master. They stopped at East Cape, Siberia, and picked up an umiak and a party of natives to man it, in case they had to cross ice interspersed with open water. As they approached the beach in the umiak, the native crew was alarmed to see one of the Karluk survivors vigorously pumping a rifle, but Swenson reassured them in their language. They removed a total of twelve expedition survivors from two separate camps. The survivors included an <b>Inupiaq</b> couple and their two children. The survivors were later transferred to the Bear.|$|E
