50|$|The <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> is {{considered}} to be an umbrella species, which means many other species are sympatric with this species and have much smaller ranges. The conservation of the habitat of an umbrella species such as the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> would not only benefit this species, but also all of the other sympatric species. The concept of an umbrella species can lead {{to a better understanding of}} endangered species protection.|$|E

5000|$|This {{carnivorous}} species mainly feed on fishes and crustaceans. [...] These fishes sometimes {{engage in}} cooperative hunting with the giant moray (Gymnothorax javanicus) {{and with the}} <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Cheilinus undulatus).|$|E
50|$|The Philippines, Indonesia, and Sabah Malaysia are {{the three}} largest {{exporters}} of the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse.</b> The fish {{has one of the}} highest retail values in Asia, especially if caught alive, and it is a delicacy in places like Malaysia. Illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) activities were identified as the major factor contributing to the failure of conservation efforts. Although the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora has placed a ban on the exportation of the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse,</b> in many cases, the fish are still being smuggled across the Malaysian-Philippine border.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Cheilinus undulatus) is {{a species}} of wrasse mainly found on coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific region. It {{is also known as}} the Māori wrasse, Napoleon wrasse, Napoleon fish, Napoleonfish, so mei 蘇眉 (Cantonese), mameng (Filipino), and merer in the Pohnpeian {{language}} of the Caroline Islands.|$|E
50|$|The <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> is {{the largest}} living {{member of the family}} Labridae. Males are {{typically}} larger than females and are capable of reaching lengths of up to 2 meters from tip to tail and weighing up to 180 kg, but the average length is generally a little less than 1 meter. Females rarely grow larger than one meter in length. This species of fish can be easily identified by its large size, thick lips, two black lines behind its eyes, and the hump that appears on the forehead of larger adults. The color of the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> can vary between a dull blue-green to more vibrant shades of green and purplish-blue. This particular reef fish prefers to live singly but adults are occasionally observed moving in small groups.|$|E
50|$|The Aquarium {{includes}} {{a variety of}} tropical marine and freshwater bony fish including Murray cod, Queensland groper, <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse,</b> barramundi as well as giant moray, zebra moray and giant shovelnose ray. There are several shark species including blacktip reef sharks, tawny nurse shark, leopard shark, zebra shark and epaulette shark.|$|E
50|$|Since {{so little}} is known about the genetic {{relationships}} at a geographical scale of the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse,</b> due to a test using microsatellite loci, (usually DNA markers are used for this specific test, but the humphead wrasses lack such markers,) researchers were able to facilitate population genetic studies in this species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> is a U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service {{species of}} concern. Species of concern are those species about which the NMFS, has some {{concerns}} regarding status and threats, but for which insufficient {{information is available}} to indicate a need to list the species under the Endangered Species Act.|$|E
50|$|The {{crown-of-thorns starfish}} is a {{voracious}} predator of coral reefs. Since the 1970s, an increasing {{population of the}} crown-of-thorns starfish has broken out, consuming more corals in the reefs. Human activity has caused {{the outbreak of the}} crown-of-thorn starfish. The overfishing of unprotected reefs may deplete much {{of the population of the}} predators of the crown-of-thorn starfish, such as the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse.</b> The triton snail, another natural predator, is being collected for its valuable shell. Nutrients from agriculture wash off to the oceans, causing phytoplanktons population increases, which gives more food for the starfish larvae.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> is long-lived, {{but has a}} {{very slow}} {{breeding}} rate. Individuals become sexually mature at four to six years, and females are known to live for around 50 years, whereas males live a slightly shorter 45 years. Humphead wrasses are protogynous hermaphrodites, with {{some members of the}} population becoming male at about 9 years old. The factors that control the timing of sex change are not yet known. Adults move to the down-current end of the reef and form local spawning aggregations (they concentrate to spawn) at certain times of the year. [...] Humphead wrasses likely do not travel very far for their spawning aggregations.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the reports}} of fish preying on Acanthaster are single {{observations}} or presumed predation from {{the nature of the}} fish. For example, the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> may prey on the starfish amongst its more usual diet. Individual puffer fish and trigger-fish have been observed to feed crown-of-thorns starfish in the Red Sea, but {{there is no evidence that}} they are a significant factor in population control. A study, however, based on the stomach contents of large carnivorous fish that are potential predators of the starfish found no evidence of the starfish in the fish's guts. These carnivorous fish were caught commercially on the coral reefs on the Gulf of Oman and examined at local fish markets.|$|E
50|$|The wrasses are a family, Labridae, {{of marine}} fish, {{many of which}} are brightly colored. The family is large and diverse, with over 600 species in 82 genera, which are divided into 9 subgroups or tribes.They are {{typically}} small fish, most of them less than 20 cm long, although the largest, the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse,</b> can measure up to 2.5 m. They are efficient carnivores, feeding {{on a wide range of}} small invertebrates. Many smaller wrasses follow the feeding trails of larger fish, picking up invertebrates disturbed by their passing. Juveniles of some representatives of the genera Bodianus, Epibulus,Cirrhilabrus, Oxycheilinus, and Paracheilinus hide among the tentacles of the free-living mushroom coral Heliofungia actiniformis.|$|E
50|$|As noted, one of {{the causes}} for {{population}} decline is the unsustainable and severe overfishing within the live reef food fish trade (LRFFT). Sabah (located on Borneo Island) is a major source for humphead wrasses. The fishing industry is specifically important to this state because of its severe poverty rates. The export of this fish out of Sabah {{has led to a}} roughly 99% decline in the population in that area. In an effort to protect the species there was a ban placed on the export of the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> out of Sabah. However, this does not prevent illegal, unreported, and unregulated activities (IUU). The protection by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) is managed in this area by the federal Department of Fisheries Malaysia, Sabah (DOFS) who issue permits to regulate fishing activity. There are two pieces of legislation that serve to protect the species as well. The Fisheries Act 1985 controls the transport of live fish as well as prohibits destructive fishing techniques and the Trade of Endangered Species Act 2008 supports Malaysia’s adoption of CITES.|$|E
40|$|The <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Cheilinus undulatus, is {{the largest}} living {{member of the family}} Labridae, with a maximum size {{exceeding}} 2 m and 190 kg. Its geographic range covers much of the Indo-Pacific. The species is not common, recorded maximum adult densities rarely exceeding 20 fish/ 10, 000 m 2. Small individuals are typically associated with high coral cover; larger fish are found mainly on outer or deep reefs, steep slopes and passes, singly or in small groups and seagrasses. However, for reproduction the species forms small spawning aggregations of tens to more than one hundred fish. The diet of the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> includes large invertebrates and small fishes. The species attains at least 30 years and reaches sexual maturation at about 35 - 50 cm total length and < 5 years of age. Most small adults are female while mainly males exceed 1 m and there is evidence of female to male sex change. The <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> is of considerable cultural value in some Pacific countries and is among the most prized in the live reef food fish export trade, for which it is often taken in its juvenile size range, either directly for sale or, increasingly, for grow-out to market size. It is also marketed chilled. The species is particularly sensitive to fishing pressure. In most fished areas, density and body size have dropped substantially. It appears to be particularly heavily targeted and depleted in SE Asia and in some places faces extirpation. The <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> is often taken by night spearfishing and by cyanide, with protection typically weak or non-existent, despite regulations and by a "vulnerable" assessment on the 1996 IUCN Red List. The <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> has not been reared successfully in hatcheries. Other giant reef fish share many similar problems and detailed study of the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> contributes to a better understanding and conservation of all such species. This review examines and evaluates published and gray literature, original unpublished research and correspondence with almost 50 knowledgeable workers. It examines the value of such sources for quickly, but adequately, assessing the conservation and management status and key data gaps in species that are little known, vulnerable, difficult and expensive to study and may require urgent management or conservation action. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|<b>Humphead</b> <b>wrasse,</b> {{known as}} the Napoleon fish (Cheilinus undulatus), is the largest living {{member of the family}} Labridae. It is slow growing but can grow to a maximum size {{exceeding}} 2 m and 190 kg. This species was the first commercially important coral reef food fish to be listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II in 2004 because of its vulnerable status and the ongoing threat to its conservation from international trade. Like many coral reef fishes, the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse,</b> Cheilinus undulatus, aggregate in reef areas when they spawn and this spawning behaviour makes them highly vulnerable to overfishing. Assessment of the spawning aggregations of this species was conducted in the municipalities of Sibutu and Sitangkai in the province of Tawi-Tawi, Philippines. Key informant interviews (KII) with fishermen, mariculturists, and other stakeholders and focus group discussions (FGD) with local government leaders, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management (FARMC) members, mariculturists, and exporters were conducted. Guided by the results of these KII and FGDs, underwater visual census of mameng (local common name for Napoleon wrasse) populations (juvenile and mature) were conducted to document spawning aggregation sites. Since there was no photo-documentation of actual spawning aggregations of mameng in the reef areas, indirect measures were used. Result of the KII and FGD indicated that the Baligtang Reef in Sipangkot and Tando Owak are major sources of spawners. Anecdotal accounts of Bajau fishermen showed that Dungun Dungon, Baligtang reef, Tando Owak and Tugalan are traditional fishing grounds for mameng spawning aggregations. From the length-frequency analysis of mameng caught by hook and line and fish pot in the Baligtang Reef in Sipangkot, the estimated length at maturity of this species was found to be 25 - 35 cm. There were 134 individuals caught within this size range so they are considered potential spawners. Another indirect proof used was the underwater documentation of juvenile <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> which were regularly observed and photographed in association with seagrass beds and branching coral reefs in Baligtang Reef in Sipangkot, Sitangkai. Gonadal study also indicated that the mameng caught in this area had mature and ripe gonads but the number of mature fish depends on the season. These were the basis of declaring Spawning Aggregation Sites in Tando Owak and Dungun Dungun in Sibutu and Baligtang Reef, Sipangkot and Tugalan in Sitangkai. These were declared as marine protected areas by ordinance of the municipal Sangguniang Bayan of the two municipalities. Management and enforcement plans have been developed and Bantay Dagat have been trained to protect the spawning aggregations and this strategy aims to protect the wild stocks of <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse.</b> Protecting the spawners would ensure that there would be enough recruits, prevent recruitment overfishing and enhance the wild stocks...|$|E
40|$|Refinements to the {{methodology}} of bomb radiocarbon dating {{made it possible to}} validate age estimates of the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Cheilinus undulatus) and bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum). Age for these species has been estimated from presumed annual growth zones in otoliths at similar to 30 and similar to 40 years respectively. The validity of these estimates was tested using bomb radiocarbon dating on the small and fragile otoliths of these species, and provided an opportunity to refine the method using advanced technologies. A regional C- 14 reference record from hermatypic coral cores from the Great Barrier Reef was assembled and C- 14 measurements from extracted otolith cores of adult otoliths were successful. Validated ages supported the accuracy of growth zone derived ages using sectioned sagittal otoliths...|$|E
40|$|In the Philippines, {{very high}} fishing {{pressure}} {{coincides with the}} globally greatest number of shorefish species, yet no long-term fisheries data are available to explore species-level changes that may have occurred widely in the most species rich and vulnerable marine ecosystem, namely coral reefs. Through 2655 face-to-face interviews conducted between August 2012 and July 2014, we used fishers' recall of past catch rates of reef-associated finfish to infer species disappearances from catches in five marine key biodiversity areas (Lanuza Bay, Danajon Bank, Verde Island Passage, Polillo Islands and Honda Bay). We modeled temporal trends in perceived catch per unit effort (CPUE) based on fishers' reports of typical good days' catches using Generalized Linear Mixed Modelling. Fifty-nine different finfish disappeared from catches between the 1950 s and 2014; 42 fish were identified to species level, two to genus, seven to family and eight to local name only. Five species occurring at all sites with {{the greatest number of}} fishers reporting zero catches were the green bumphead parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Cheilinus undulatus), African pompano (Alectis ciliaris), giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) and mangrove red snapper (Lutjanus argentimaculatus). Between the 1950 s and 2014, the mean perceived CPUE of bumphead parrotfish declined by 88 %, that of <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> by 82 %, African pompano by 66 %, giant grouper by 74 % and mangrove red snapper by 64 %. These declines were mainly associated with excess and uncontrolled fishing, fish life-history traits like maximum body size and socio-economic factors like access to market infrastructure and services, and overpopulation. The fishers' knowledge is indicative of extirpations where evidence for these losses was otherwise lacking. Our models provide information as basis for area-based conservation and regional resource management particularly for the more vulnerable, once common, large, yet wide-ranging reef finfish species...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries (EAF) is a {{holistic}} one as EAF considers all species as important {{elements within the}} eco-system. An EAF requires that community and ecosystem structure should be maintained by harvesting fish communities in proportion to their natural productivity, thereby sustaining the balance of species and sizes in a community. This article draws from research on the reef fish community and catch in Kotania Bay on Seram Island in Maluku, Indonesia, an area of approximately 6000 ha. Based on the trophic guild (ie the aggregation of species utilizing similar food resources) on the reef, the biomass of predator fish currently being captured now represents 40. 4 % of the total catch biomass. Members of the grouper family, the <b>humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> (Cheilinus undulatus) and trevally (Caranx melampygus) in particular, have become targeted for sale in fish markets. If these predators are selectively targeted and exploited, the overall reef fishery and the human populations that depend on it may become imperilled, given these species’ significant roles in controlling those lower in the food chain. This study thereby emphasizes the need for balanced fisheries informed by the EAF model in small island fisheries management in order to sustain food security in such regions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} review of 23 {{published}} case studies, the main {{objective is to}} report the emergence and epidemiology of ciguatera in the coastal cities of southern China. There was a sudden surge in ciguatera outbreaks in 2004. Ciguatera mostly occurred in the Guangdong Province. In Shenzhen, the incidence of ciguatera in 2004 {{was estimated to be}} over 7. 5 per million people. In Foshan and Zhongshan, three large outbreaks each affecting over 100 – 200 subjects (caused by tiger grouper served at banquets) accounted for the much higher incidence of ciguatera in 2004 (> 48. 7 and > 129. 9 per million people). <b>Humphead</b> <b>wrasse</b> and areolated coral grouper were the other important ciguatoxic fish. In some subjects, risk factors for increased likelihood of (severe) ciguatera were present, namely concomitant alcohol consumption and ingestion of large reef fishes and CTX-rich fish parts. To prevent large outbreaks and severe illness, large apex predators from coral reefs should never be served at banquets and the public should realize the increased risk of severe symptoms due to ingestion of CTX-rich fish parts with alcohol. The systematic collection of accurate details, implementation of risk assessment process and continuing education for the public on prevention are of obvious importance...|$|E
40|$|The {{distinctive}} hump on {{the forehead}} of large individuals of the <b>Humphead</b> <b>Wrasse,</b> Cheilinus undulatus, a protogynous hermaphroditic reef fish, is often {{assumed to be a}} male-associated secondary sexual characteristic, but this has never been evaluated. A unique opportunity arose to obtain confiscated specimens, 161 females and 17 males, ranging in body sizes from 20. 8 to 129. 0 cm total length (TL), making this evaluation possible for the first time. The hump was quantified in terms of its maximum angle of elevation, and its development was determined to be size-associated. A notable hump was recorded in 16 females and all 17 males, becoming visible around 37. 0 cm TL, and all specimens ≥ 75. 0 cm TL exhibited a distinctive hump, irrespective of sex. There was a linear and positive correlation between body size and maximum angle of hump elevation for both sexes; males tended to have larger humps because they were larger in body size rather than because of sexual dimorphism for hump development. The development of a cephalic hump or a horn {{on the forehead}} has been documented in several groups of reef fishes, and its possible adaptive significance in different groups is discussed. © 2011 by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
