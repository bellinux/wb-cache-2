But Fulkerson said: [...] "Don't mind that, old man. It's the whole country that <b>makes</b> or <b>breaks</b> a thing like this; New York has {{very little to do with}} it.

The great mass of the readers are outside of New York, and the rural districts are what we have got to go for. They don't read much in New York; they write, and talk about what they've written. Don't you worry." ...|$|R
