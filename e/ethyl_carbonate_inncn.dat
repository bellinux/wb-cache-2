40|$|The {{substitution}} of a chlorine atom with a carbonate moiety in mustard compounds {{has led to}} a new class of molecules, namely mustard carbonates that retain the reactivity of the well-know toxic iprites, but are safe for the operator and the environment [1]. Herein we report the influence of the leaving group on the neighboring effect of sulfur half mustard carbonates (HMCs) usually less reactive than nitrogen ones [2]. Several new 2 -(methylthio) <b>ethyl</b> alkyl <b>carbonates</b> have been synthesized and their reactivity has been investigated in both autoclave and neat conditions. The results reactions between the HMCs and phenol performed in autoclave (180 °C, no base, in acetonitrile media) showed that the efficiency of the anchimeric effect is directly dependent on the steric hindrance of the HMC leaving group. The least steric hindered 2 -(methylthio) <b>ethyl</b> methyl <b>carbonate</b> gave the methyl (2 -phenoxyethyl) sulfane in higher yield, whereas the most steric hindered 2 -(methylthio) <b>ethyl</b> t-butyl <b>carbonate</b> did not reacted at all. The influence of the leaving group on the anchimeric effect has been also investigated in neat conditions at 150 °C in the presence of catalytic amount of K 2 CO 3.

Interestingly 2 -(methylthio) <b>ethyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbonate</b> showed to be the most efficient carbonate among the ones studied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{reactions}} of mono [...] bromo <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbonate</b> with carboxylic acids, amines, and alcohols were investigated {{as a model}} tool for the prepara-tion of novel aliphatic polycarbonate esters. The formation of the correspond-ing carbonate ester, carbamate, and carbonate derivatives, showed that of {{the three types of}} groups chosen to react with -bromo <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbonate,</b> only the carboxylate anions displaced the bromo group to form the corresponding -car-bonate ester bond (R—COO—CH(CH 3) —O—CO—CH 2 —CH 3). This approach was applied to the synthesis of pendent carbonate ester groups onto aliphatic polycarbonates. The synthetic pathway involved partial bromination of poly-trimethylene carbonate (PTMC) to Br-PTMC, which was then reacted with benzoic acid or acetic acid to form the corresponding benzoate and acetate pendent polycarbonate, respectively. The hydrolysis of Br-PTMC and its deriv-atives as possible biodegradable polymers were investigated. The benzoate group was more susceptible to hydrolysis than the carbonate group hence degradation of the ester catalyzed the hydrolysis of the polymer and improved its biodegradability. The decrease in molecular weight, the release profile for benzoic acid from the grafted polymer and the degradation of Br-PTMC, AC-PTMC and PTMC, in terms of the change in pH, were evaluated. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|R

The {{success of}} the allylation, which is not {{efficient}} under typical strong base-mediated conditions, {{is the result of}} mild conditions thanks to a progressive delivery of ethoxide. Indeed, <b>ethyl</b> allyl <b>carbonates</b> act as a latent source of ethoxide for generation of the trifluoroethyl carbanion that reacts with the π-allylpalladium complex. The utility of the method is illustrated in a new approach to difluoromethyl compounds...|$|R

In {{the title}} salt, C 6 H 14 N 3 +C 3 H 5 O 3, the C—N bond lengths {{in the central}} CN 3 unit of the carboxamidinium cation are 1. 3262 (18), 1. 3359 (18) and 1. 3498 (18) Å, {{indicating}} partial double-bond character. The central C atom is bonded to the three N atoms in a nearly ideal trigonal–planar geometry and the positive charge is delocalized in the CN 3 plane. The piperidine ring is in a chair conformation. The C—O bond lengths in the <b>ethyl</b> <b>carbonate</b> anion are characteristic for a delocalized double bond and a typical single bond. In the crystal, N—H O hydrogen bonds between cations and anions generate a two-dimensional network {{in the direction of}} the ab plane, whereas adjacent ion pairs form chains running along the b axis.
