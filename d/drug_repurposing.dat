Recent cases of sinusitis and cutaneous infections report successful results when treated with amphotericin B, itraconazole and/or voriconazole. Although E. rostratum is sensitive to amphotericin B, a common antifungal agent, the severe and potentially lethal side-effects of this drug have limited its use in certain patients, particularly those of older age. A recent <b>drug</b> <b>repurposing</b> screening of antifungal agents suggests the triazoles posaconazole and lanoconazole as useful alternative agents for treating E. rostratum infection. Posaconazole is highly potent and can be taken orally for the prolonged treatment of non-CNS infections like septic joints.

For example, Viagra® (sildenafil) was first synthesized in 1989 by two Pfizer chemists at the company’s Sandwich, Kent research facility in England. Viagra was initially studied for use in hypertension (high blood pressure) and angina pectoris (a symptom of ischemic heart disease). After Phase II testing of sildenafil for angina failed to show promising results, Pfizer decided to pursue its use for erectile dysfunction rather than for angina. The drug was patented in 1996 and approved for use in erectile dysfunction by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1998 (and expanded approvals were obtained for pulmonary hypertension in 2005).

40|$|Background The {{detection}} of adverse drug effect sentences in medical text reduces the efforts {{required for the}} manual task of drug safety monitoring by decreasing the number of reports which need to be investigated by drug safety experts. Moreover it helps in compiling a highly accurate and machine-understandable drug-related adverse effects knowledge bases which can support pharmacovigilance research and aids computational approaches for <b>drugs</b> <b>repurposing.</b> In this study, we proposed a pattern-based method to detect the sentences containing drug-adverse effect causal relation from medical case reports. Materials and methods A set of 500 full abstracts from Medline medical case reports containing 988 adverse drug effect sentences from ADE corpus were {{used to evaluate the}} sentences detection task. Our method combined an outcome of a concept recognition system with a method for automatic generation of numerous patterns. Results Our method achieved recall of 72. 8, precision of 93. 6 and F-Score of 81. 7 % in the adverse drug effect sentences detection task.

40|$|The {{repositioning}} or “repurposing” {{of existing}} therapies for alternative disease indications {{is an attractive}} approach that can save significant investments {{of time and money}} during drug development. For cancer indications, the primary goal of repurposed therapies is on efficacy, with less restriction on safety due to the immediate need to treat this patient population. This report provides a high-level overview of how <b>drug</b> developers pursuing <b>repurposed</b> assets have previously navigated funding efforts, regulatory affairs, and intellectual property laws to commercialize these “new” medicines in oncology.

5000|$|Network {{pharmacology}} is {{a developing}} field based in systems pharmacology {{that looks at}} the effect of drugs on both the interactome and the diseasome. The drug-target network (DTN) {{can play an important}} role in understanding the mechanisms of action of approved and experimental drugs. The network theory view of pharmaceuticals is based on the effect of the drug in the interactome, especially the region that the drug target occupies. Combination therapy for a complex disease (polypharmacology) is suggested in this field since one active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) aimed at one target may not effect the entire disease module. The concept of disease modules can be used to aid in drug discovery, drug design, and the development of biomarkers for disease detection. There can be a variety of ways to identifying drugs using network pharmacology; a simple example of this is the [...] "guilt by association" [...] method. This states if two diseases are treated by the same drug, a drug that treats one disease may treat the other. <b>Drug</b> <b>repurposing,</b> drug-drug interactions and drug side-effects have also been studied in this field.|$|E
50|$|One notable {{example of}} <b>drug</b> <b>repurposing</b> {{is taking the}} partial mu-opioid {{receptor}} agonist buprenorphine - which has been prescribed for control of moderate pain for decades in low dosages {{in the form of}} Temgesic 200mcg sublingual tablets, Buprenex 300mcg/mL ampoules - and marketing a high-dosage formulation (Subutex 2 mg and 8 mg) for the interruption and maintenance of heroin and other opioid addictions, which it has proven very beneficial for, with over 200,000 people in the United States alone on buprenorphine maintenance. Some of the reasons for this are that the drug has a ceiling effect - higher doses do not cause further activation of opioid receptors - and a very long half-life in >2 mg dosages. It also has an extremely high binding affinity for opioid receptors, which keeps the drug from being displaced by opioids like Dilaudid, heroin, morphine, and oxycodone, with the result that a user maintained on it can not get high no matter what dosage taken of most opioids. The only opioids that may be able to break through the buprenorphine blockade (which are required in an acute care setting if a buprenorphine patient requires pain relief, as no standard opioids are strong enough) - drugs with similar or higher binding affinities to buprenorphine itself - are the fentanil-class opioids, and the Bentley-series opioids (cf. etorphine, dihydroetorphine), which are rarely primary drugs of abuse and not often found on the streets. Buprenorphine itself is a modified Bentley-series opioid.|$|E

5000|$|Samudrala's {{research}} has focused on understanding how the genome of an organism specifies its behaviour and characteristics, and applying that information to improve health and quality of life. His vision is to produce a computing model of life focused on atomic level detail, organisation, and arrangements of all the components involved, which he calls the [...] "structeome". The structeome, which is the actual structural organization of components at the atomic level, by its very nature includes single molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, as well larger groupings such genomes, proteome, interactomes, connectomes, and so on. Since the vision is of a large collection of atoms with subgroupings of atoms that work together in a complex dynamic manner, a protein would be a collection of atoms, many of which are covalently bonded, that interact together to perform a specific biological function. Samudrala's work has thus focussed on proteins, which is the fundamental unit of biological function within the structeome. Atoms in a structeome interact with the environment which may include other structeomes (or components thereof) thereby causing a strange loop or a tangled hierarchy of interactions. Thus a structeome would include not only all atoms and their interactions within that structeome, but also all interactions to other structeomes. Samudrala has extended this theoretical framework to explain how evolution works by recursion of existing information and has used it to solve research problems with practical applications in medicine, such as therapeutic discovery based on docking with dynamics, [...] multitargeting, and <b>drug</b> <b>repurposing</b> in a shotgun manner, as well as in nanobiotechnology, such as engineering tooth tissue by designing novel peptides that bind to various inorganic substrates.|$|E

However, there are no established approaches to either select appropriate target sets or design polypharmacological drugs. Here, we propose a structural-proteomics approach that utilizes the structural information of the binding sites at a genome-scale obtained through in-house algorithms to characterize the pocketome, yielding a list of ligands that can participate in various biochemical events in the mycobacterial cell. The pocket-type space is seen to be much larger than the sequence or fold-space, suggesting that variations at the site-level contribute significantly to functional repertoire of the organism. All-pair comparisons of binding sites within Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), pocket-similarity network construction and clustering result in identification of binding-site sets, each containing a group of similar binding sites, theoretically having a potential to interact with a common set of compounds. A polypharmacology index is formulated to rank targets by incorporating a measure of druggability and similarity to other pockets within the proteome.
