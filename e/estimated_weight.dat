5|$|Scientists {{studying}} the horses rate their body condition {{on a scale}} of one (excellent) to five (very poor), based mainly on <b>estimated</b> <b>weight</b> and muscle tone. The horses tend to remain in above average condition, despite the harsh environment in which they live, with stallions generally averaging better condition then mares. During severe droughts, the average body score decreases, but even then horses are found with moderate body scores and the entire population is never in very poor condition. The condition of the horses is directly correlated to rainfall, through a correlation to available forage, though temperature, distance between forage and water and individual energy expenditures also play a role. Studies during the 1990s found no evidence of equine disease among the population and few external parasites. Investigations of carcasses found four internal nematode parasites present (strongyles, small and large pinworms and Ascarids), as well as the larvae of botflys.|$|E
5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The <b>estimated</b> <b>weight</b> was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E

25|$|The {{southern}} {{elephant seal}} (Mirounga leonina) {{is one of the}} two species of elephant seals. It is both the largest living pinniped and member of the order Carnivora, as well as the largest marine mammal after the cetaceans. It gets its name from its great size and the large proboscis of the adult male, which is used to make extraordinarily loud roaring noises, especially during the mating season. About 40 percent heavier than the male northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris) and more than twice as heavy as the male walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), the bull {{southern elephant seal}} is without rival the largest carnivoran alive. An average adult male southern elephant seal weighs six to seven times more than the largest terrestrial carnivorans, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) and Kodiak bear (Ursus arctos middendorffi).

40|$|Amylases from {{incubated}} aleurone layers or from {{starchy endosperm}} of barley seeds (Hordeum vulgare L. cv.

Electrophoresis of amylase from aleurone layers yields seven visually distinct isozymes with an <b>estimated</b> molecular <b>weight</b> of 43, 000. Because each isozyme hydrolyzes β-limit dextrin azure and incorporates calcium- 45, they are α-amylases. On Sephadex G- 200, amylase from the aleurone layers is separated into seven fractions ranging in <b>estimated</b> molecular <b>weights</b> from 45, 000 to 3, 000. Little or no activity is observed when six fractions {{are subjected to}} electrophoresis. Electrophoresis of only the fraction with the <b>estimated</b> molecular <b>weight</b> of 45, 000 gave the seven isozymes. The amylases are heat labile and cannot be stabilized {{by the presence of}} substrate or by the protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride.
