5|$|After {{continuing}} through the southeast United States, the storm became extratropical {{near the border}} of North Carolina and Virginia midday on September18. Although it initially maintained tropical storm-force winds, the former hurricane weakened below gale-force on September19 while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> Philadelphia. The storm continued rapidly to the northeast, moving through New England and {{along the coast of}} Maine before turning more to the east. Late on September19, the storm moved across Nova Scotia, passing southeast of Newfoundland the next day. It was last observed late on September20 dissipating to the east of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|Most of what {{is known}} of Du Fu's life comes from his poems. His {{paternal}} grandfather was Du Shenyan, a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu. Du Fu was born in 712; the exact birthplace is unknown, except that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> Luoyang, Henan province (Gong county is a favourite candidate). In later life, he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang'an, ancestral hometown of the Du family.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensity}} of Abby began to gradually level off, though it re-intensified {{slightly in the}} Caribbean, before eventually weakening further. Abby was downgraded to a tropical storm {{on the morning of}} July 13; it was center roughly 222mi (357km) south of Kingston, Jamaica at the time. Just six hours thereafter, Abby had maximum sustained winds of only 45mph (75km/h). Abby re-intensified at a relatively quick pace, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> hurricane status again when it passed just to the north of Honduras on July 14.|$|E

5|$|During Season 5, it is {{revealed}} that Wilson's homeless brother Danny suffered from schizophrenia since adolescence, {{which is what}} caused him to run away. Wilson blames himself for his brother's homelessness, having hung up on Danny right before he disappeared. Wilson also reveals to House that he took the position at Princeton-Plainsboro because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> the place he had last seen Danny. When Wilson finds out that Danny is in the Psychiatric Ward of New York Mercy Hospital , House offers to come with him to keep him company, noting that it could end badly. However, when Wilson is let in to see his brother, House is busy with a differential with his team.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) {{took over}} issuing {{warnings}} on the hurricane, as Fernanda crossed 140° W into their area of responsibility. After maintaining a west-northwest track {{for much of}} its duration, the hurricane turned more toward the west. By August 15, the storm was expected to pass between Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii; however, the CPHC noted uncertainty due to an approaching upper-level trough, which would produce a more northerly tack. Its winds weakened to about 85mph (140km/h), although late on August 15 the hurricane re-intensified to winds of 105mph (165km/h). By that time, it had redeveloped a large eye of 50 miles in diameter; wind gusted to 120mph (195km/h), while tropical storm force winds extended 200 miles (640km) from the center. Hurricane Hunters flew into the hurricane to provide observational data while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after {{becoming}} a hurricane, Kenna began to rapidly intensify with a 17mi (27km) wide eye located within its well-defined central dense overcast. Early on October 24 Kenna {{became a major}} hurricane, and in a 24‑hour period the hurricane more than doubled its windspeed from 70mph (115km/h) winds to 145mph (235km/h). After turning {{to the north and}} northeast in response to the flow ahead of a large mid to upper-level trough, Kenna attained peak winds of 165mph (265km/h) early on October 25 while located about 255mi (410km) southwest of Puerto Vallarta, the third Category 5 hurricane of the season. A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the hurricane while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> peak intensity recorded a pressure of 913mbar (hPa), the fourth lowest recorded pressure for a Pacific hurricane.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} of helium was observed on August 18, 1868, as {{a bright yellow}} line with a wavelength of 587.49 nanometers in the spectrum of the chromosphere of the Sun. The line was detected by French astronomer Jules Janssen during a total solar eclipse in Guntur, India. This line was initially assumed to be sodium. On October 20 of the same year, English astronomer Norman Lockyer observed a yellow line in the solar spectrum, which he named the D3 Fraunhofer line because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> the known D1 and D2 lines of sodium. He concluded that it was caused by an element in the Sun unknown on Earth. Lockyer and English chemist Edward Frankland named the element with the Greek word for the Sun, ἥλιος (helios).|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} both Chancellery {{buildings}} were levelled by the Soviets between 1945 and 1949 {{as part of}} an effort to destroy the landmarks of Nazi Germany. The bunker largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried to blow up the bunker, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the bunker. Because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped and neglected until 1988–89. During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed. Other parts of the Chancellery underground complex were uncovered, but these were ignored, filled in, or resealed.|$|E

5|$|U-30s third patrol {{was much}} more successful. Having left Wilhelmshaven on 23 December 1939, she journeyed into the North Sea. She then circumnavigated the British Isles and {{travelled}} along the southern coast of Ireland. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> {{to the west coast}} of Scotland that U-30 sank her first enemy vessel during her third patrol, the 325 ton anti-submarine trawler HMS Barbara Robertson, on 28 December. That same day, she hit a much bigger target, the British battleship HMS Barham. Following the sinking of Barbara Robertson, U-30 fired a torpedo at the battleship and damaged her, killing four crew members. U-30s next three victims were sunk by mines laid by the U-boat: El Oso, sunk on 11 January; Gracia, damaged on 16 January and Cairnross, sunk on 17 January. Meanwhile, U-30 returned to her home port of Wilhelmshaven on 17 January 1940.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} that Soudelor became a typhoon, it began moving toward the north, {{influenced}} by an approaching trough, and it passed about 95km (60mi) northeast of Luzon. A ragged eye developed early on June17, which quickly became better organized. With its outflow enhanced by the approaching trough, Soudelor rapidly intensified {{to the east of}} Taiwan. The typhoon struck the Japanese island of Iriomote-jima at around 2030UTC on June17. At 0600UTC on June18, the JTWC estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 215km/h (135mph). At the same time, JMA estimated peak 10‑minute winds of 150km/h (90mph) when it was located west of Okinawa. While at its maximum strength, Soudelor had a circular eye 33km (21mi) in diameter. It turned to the north-northeast, maintaining its peak winds for about 12hours before increased shear from the westerlies caused weakening. The eye quickly dissipated, and the system began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. Early on June19, the JMA downgraded Soudelor below typhoon status, and the storm later crossed Tsushima Island into the Sea of Japan. At 1500UTC that day, the JMA declared the storm as extratropical while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> the Oki Islands; the JTWC followed suit three hours later. The extratropical remnants of Soudelor continued to the northeast, crossing northern Japan on June20. The storm slowed and turned to the east, dissipating on June24.|$|E
5|$|So the {{production}} could be managed {{in the short}} time available, the movie's development was separated into three phases, with each phase being dedicated to a particular part of {{the production}} process and run by a different unit director answering to Nozue. The movie went through multiple phases of trial and error until the final product was solidified. Kingsglaive was kept a secret until 2016 when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> completion, as the developers felt that they had announced its parent video game too early. So as to remain close to the development of Final Fantasy XV, the lead staff of Kingsglaive moved from Visual Works to Business Division 2, the department of Square Enix responsible for the game's development. This was part of an overall shift in development methods when the game was changed from a spin-off to a mainline entry. In addition to the staff of Advent Children, Western companies in gaming and movie production were involved: Digic Pictures, who had worked on the graphics for the Assassin's Creed series; and Image Engine, who had worked on multiple films including Jurassic World (2015) and the television series Game of Thrones. According to Nozue, around 50 different companies were involved in the film's production: among these was Europe-based company Puppetworks Animation Studio. The internal team was estimated at around 50 people. The cooperation of studios overseas meant that work on the movie could proceed continuously. Without this external aid, Nozue estimated that they would have needed a staff of five hundred people to complete the film in the given timeframe.|$|E

5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. The {{idea was that}} if a shell could explode when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>near</b> an enemy aircraft, a near miss would be nearly as effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. The second problem had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans {{were given to the}} Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them. For his services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944.|$|E

25|$|Any {{advance warning}} for {{the enemy of}} the {{approaching}} helicopters, and the anticipated reactions caused by surprise and confusion, were decisive factors in the coming engagement.
