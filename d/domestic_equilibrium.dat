40|$|Japan’s {{seemingly}} monolithic protectionist farm {{policies were}} often easily moderated by external pressures. This study analyzes {{the change of}} the degree and the methods of protectionist farm policies, focusing on Japan’s most important crop, rice. It calculates consumer surplus, producer surplus and government spending in {{the past fifty years}} and integrates these figures into one diagram utilizing the STC (surplus transformation curve) analysis, developed by Bruce Gardner in 1983. The result of the analyses suggests that external pressures have a considerable impact on domestic protectionist farm policies. For example, in 1986 when the demand by the RMA (Rice Milling Association) in the U. S. that Japan should open its rice market was issued, the STC diagram clearly shows that the level of protection estimated from the international market price diminished. Nevertheless, at that time the level of protection estimated from the <b>domestic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> did not fall. This implies that the government successfully pretended to resist external pressure, but in reality reduced the level of protection, considering the US demands. Furthermore, in 1994 when the Uruguay Round agreement was finalized, the STC diagram also shows that Japan’s acceptance reduced its level of protection. The level of protection estimated from the <b>domestic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> was also reduced at the same time. These two observations suggest that external pressures distinctly affect the degree of protectionist farm policies, while the method of protection depends on domestic political conditions.

Using a multi-stakeholder model, the paper analyzes who the key players are, what interests they represent, and how much influence they wield to force the outcome to their preference. The forecasted <b>domestic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is biased toward the status quo or the long-term phase out, which is apparently unacceptable to the U.

40|$|An {{implication}} of the "globalization hazard" hypothesis is that sudden stops could be prevented by offering foreign investors price guarantees on emerging markets assets. These guarantees create a tradeoff, however, because they weaken globalization hazard by creating international moral hazard. We study this tradeoff using an equilibrium asset-pricing model. Without guarantees, margin calls and trading costs cause Sudden Stops driven by Fisher''s debt-deflation process. Price guarantees prevent this deflation by propping up foreign asset demand, but their effectiveness and welfare implications depend critically on the price elasticity of foreign demand and on making the guarantees contingent on debt levels.

De jure Albania currently applies a flexible exchange rate regime. Traditionally the main argument in favour of this policy is that monetary policy is not constrained by the predetermined level of the exchange rate. Thus, monetary policy sets interest rates in order to achieve <b>domestic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> (ie. price stability) while the nominal exchange rate adjusts to balance the external accounts. Theoretical evidence concerning the impact of exchange rate stability on growth is mixed. The theoretical arguments in favour of flexible exchange rates are mainly of macroeconomic nature, as flexible exchange rates allow for an easier adjustment in response to asymmetric country specific real shocks. From a microeconomic perspective low exchange rate volatility can be associated with lower transaction costs for international trade and capital flows thereby contributing to higher growth...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple model based on several equilibrium {{relationships between the}} real exchange rate —the relative price of tradable and non tradable goods— and monetary policy, represented by the real interest rate. The <b>domestic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> represents the real exchange rate response directed at eliminating any excess demand in the goods market; the external equilibrium represents the real exchange rate response directed at maintaining a sustainable current account deficit; meanwhile the financial arbitrage condition represents the response that ensures that the expected return of financial capital is the same in domestic and foreign currency. There is only one real interest rate level and one real exchange rate level compatible with global equilibrium; without international capital mobility, monetary policy is fully autonomous to reach this global equilibrium position. The global equilibrium position can be modified by fiscal policy, particularly allowing the equilibrium to be attained {{at different levels of}} the real interest rate. Under full international capital mobility, monetary policy effectiveness is limited and a more flexible fiscal policy, that limits the impact of shocks on the equilibrium interest rate, or a reserve requirement on capital flows, that increases the operational range of monetary policy, is needed to preserve global equilibrium. Without them {{it will be necessary to}} take as given the external current account deficit levels that international financial markets are willing to accept, and these level can be extremely volatile, moving from the amplitude and easiness that allows for large expansions in domestic expenditure to the tough restrictions that require severe adjustments. ...|$|E

40|$|Agriculture is a {{vulnerable}} {{sector of the}} U. S economy, accounting for 13 % of Gross Domestic Product and 15 % of employment. It produces quality cheap food for domestic consumption and {{accounts for more than}} $ 65 billion in export revenues. Contagious animal diseases like Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) are often referred to as economic diseases because of the magnitude of harm they cause producers, local communities and the consequences in international trade. Losses from the 2001 FMD outbreak in the United Kingdom are estimated at $ 10. 7 to $ 11. 7 billion. The total cost of an FMD outbreak is the sum of eradication cost, production losses, and the loss of exports. This paper examines the export effects of a bioterrorist attack such as the introduction of FMD on the US beef industry. The context is to model the US beef market as a price taker on the international beef market, the simplifying “small open economy” assumption of international economics. Although, the beef market is linked to beef prices around the world, we tend to conceive of the US beef market in terms of domestic supply and demand and the resulting <b>domestic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> price. The excess supply of beef is the difference between quantities supplied and demanded that increases with price and responds to other influences on domestic supply and demand. We assumed that U. S consumers will exercise more caution when purchasing beef at grocery store {{as a result of the}} outbreak of FMD. As U. S consumers alter their diet, poultry and pork will become good substitutes with poultry having a higher demand than pork. The economic impact of FMD is simulated based on expected changes in price of beef and its substitutes based on three different scenarios of the levels of FMD occurrences.

40|$|This work analyses: - The EU {{pressure}} to curb illegal emigration {{and the resulting}} domestic change in Albania; in addition to establishing the temporal co-variation of EU pressure and domestic change, it explores the causal mechanism linking the two variables. After having identified a <b>domestic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> in favor of continuation of emigration and high domestic costs of compliance with EU migration demands, this work examines why Albanian decision-makers accepted EU conditions in this area despite their costs by tracing the domestic process {{that leads to the}} decisions to comply. - The change in Albanian readmission policy as a result of EU pressure; it is demonstrated that the country has not only accepted the legal obligation to take back its citizens residing illegally in the EU and nationals of other countries who had reached the EU via Albania. It has also created the institutional and procedural conditions for implementation of those legal obligations, and statistical data demonstrate that Albania is accepting all the illegal immigrants returned by the EU member states. - The consequences of this imposed adaptation for the human rights of the returnees; {{as a result of the}} EU leverage, Albania is extremely cooperative in the readmission of migrants originating from or transiting through the country although its preparedness for such a move is deficient. In such a situation, the protection of the human rights of the returnees is seriously put at risk. From the theoretical perspective, the thesis assesses the explanatory power of the theoretical models on mechanisms of external influence over domestic policy. The explanatory variable – EU pressure – and the dependent variable – change in Albanian migration policy – are linked via the role of the domestic structure and an analysis of how rational choice and sociological institutionalism account for the role of the domestic structure in linking the two variables. It is argued that a synthesis of rational and normative models provides better insights into the role of external influence and of the domestic structure for policy change. The study of the place the EU has accorded to migration in its relations with Albania contributes also to the debate on what kind of power the EU represents in its external relations...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsAndrew P. BarkleyTariff rate quotas (TRQs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely used trade policy {{instruments}} in agricultural trade. The issue of whether TRQs are efficient trade policy instruments for improving market access has been widely debated. Some believe that TRQs impose an extra barrier to trade, circumvent the reforms sought under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and World Trade Organization (WTO) and may not be as attractive as initially envisioned. Others believe that the TRQs are useful and facilitate trade and liberalization. Any expansion in quota, or decrease in tariffs, or combinations of the two, has the potential to liberalize trade in a specific industry. There is strong clamor for continued reforms in the conduct of agricultural trade – including the implementation of TRQs. The purpose of this study is to increase the understanding of TRQs, and determine the impact of their implementation on the Philippine corn market. Specifically, the study will estimate the quantities of supply, demand, imports, <b>domestic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> prices, and border prices under different TRQ liberalization regimes. In this study, an existing TRQ model was utilized to determine how effective TRQs are as a trade policy instrument for trade liberalization and increasing market access. The results reveal that the Philippine corn market was restricted by the out-quota tariff. De facto liberalization of the TRQ at the level of the out-quota rate (50 %) or even at 35 % (in-quota rate), does not completely liberalize the corn market. Progressively reducing both tariffs liberalizes the market and leads to increases in surpluses. The lower tariffs, however, lead to less government revenues. The smaller the gap between the in-quota and out-quota, the smaller the quota rents become. Increasing the quotas has no significant impact in liberalizing the corn market, and the increase in imports decrease producer surplus in all cases. The TRQ model of the Philippine corn sector reveals that changing the components of the TRQ would lead to different impacts on supply, demand, consumer, producer and net surplus, and government revenues. Knowledge of the regime in which the country is trading can determine which individual policy instrument of the TRQ, the in-quota and out-quota tariff and the quota, should be used to increase market access or address the concerns of stakeholders in the corn sector. It is thus important for policy makers to find a workable tariff level that would serve the interest of all stakeholders in the sector...|$|E

A country that expects to face a low effective foreign interest rate, reflecting the expectation that it won't be forced to repay its foreign debts in full, will be characterized by high government spending, a high government budget deficit, low domestic saving and thus a high trade balance deficit so that the domestic economy will look mismanaged in terms of a number of macroeconomic indicators.

40|$|We {{consider}} an economy which imports energy from a monopolistic price-setter. The <b>domestic</b> general <b>equilibrium</b> of this economy adjusts {{in response to}} the price of energy. We define the total cross price elasticity of demand between energy and capital as the cross price elasticity across general equilibria of the economy, as the equilibrium changes in response to energy price changes. This corresponds to the price elasticity given by a total demand curve, and incorporates adjustments on both supply and demand sides. It is shown that whether this total elasticity implies energy-capital complementarity or substitutability depends upon the parameters of the model and the price of energy: for a given model, there may be a change from substitutability to complementarity as the price of energy rises. This framework offers an additional way of reconciling apparently conflicting findings on energy-capital complementarity and substitutability: an earlier suggestion was made by Berndt and Wood (1979). It is a natural extension of the general equilibrium approach initiated by Hogan (1977) ...|$|R

Spillovers are mostly transmitted through advanced country financial conditions and fluctuations in external demand for Central American exports. Shocks to advanced economies associated with the 2008 - 09 financial crisis lowered economic activity in the region by 4 to 5 percent, on average, accounting for a majority of the observed slowdown. The impact was almost twice as large as elasticities estimated on pre-crisis data would have predicted.

Higher systemic risks induce both higher real interest rates and increased dollarization. Using appropriate instruments for the dollarization ratio, the study overcomes the simultaneous equation problem and correctly estimates a negative coefficient for the dollarization ratio in the interest rate equation. It confirms the theoretical prediction that a strategy of "dedollarizing" the economy will raise the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domestic</b> real interest rate if the strategy fails to address fundamental macroeconomic risks. Even so, it also finds that this effect is small, after controlling for the risks of dilution and default.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{systemic}} risks and financial dollarization on real interest rates in emerging economies. Higher systemic risks induce both higher real interest rates and increased dollarization. Using appropriate instru-ments for the dollarization ratio, the study overcomes the simultaneous equation problem and correctly estimates a negative coefficient for the dollarization ratio in the interest rate equation. It confirms the theoretical prediction that a strat-egy of “dedollarizing ” the economy will raise the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>domestic</b> real interest rate if the strategy fails to address fundamental macroeconomic risks. Even so, it also finds that this effect is small, after controlling for the risks of dilution and default. The results bring to light the systemic-risk reasons for high interest rates in emerging economies—and contribute to evaluating the difficulties of dedollarization policies. JEL codes: E 43, F 31, O 16, O 23, O 54 In a study of financial contracts and risks in emerging economies, De la Torre and Schmukler (2004) argue that dollar contracts {{at home and abroad}} are rational responses of agents trying to cope with high systemic risks.

40|$|The paper {{provides}} an alternative {{explanation for the}} "resource curse" based on the income effect resulting from high government current spending in resource rich economies. Using a simple life cycle framework, we show that private investment in the non-resource sector is adversely affected if private agents expect extra government current spending financed through resource sector revenues in the future. This income channel of the resource curse is stronger for countries with lower degrees of openness and forward altruism. We empirically validate these findings by estimating non-hydrocarbon sector growth regressions using a panel of 25 oil-exporting countries over 1992 - 2005.

40|$|Over {{the past}} two years, the IMF staff has been {{developing}} a new multicountry macroeconomic model called the Global Economy Model (GEM). This paper explains why such a model is needed, how GEM differs from its predecessor model, and how the new features of the model can improve the IMF’s policy analysis. The paper is aimed at a general audience and avoids technical detail. It outlines the motivation, structure, strengths, and limitations of the model; examines three simulation exercises that have been completed; and discusses the future path of GEM.
