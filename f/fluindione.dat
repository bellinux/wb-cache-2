40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: <b>Fluindione</b> is an oral vitamin K {{antagonist}} (indanedione derivative) exclusively marketed in France and Luxembourg, {{known to}} have immuno-allergic adverse effects such as hepatitis, fever or interstitial nephritis. A few cases of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported with <b>fluindione.</b> The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate fluindione-induced DRESS cases reported in France and to describe their characteristics. METHODS: We searched for potential cases of DRESS with <b>fluindione</b> reported in the French pharmacovigilance database since 2000. RESULTS: Thirty-six cases of DRESS were included and concerned 17 women and 19 men. The mean age was 65  years (median: 68  years, range: 28 - 95  years). Kidneys and liver were the most frequent organs involved. Thirty-five cases were serious. In 5 cases, the effect was life-threatening. Most of the patients recovered. <b>Fluindione</b> was the only medicine suspected in 26 cases. Skin patch tests, performed in 10 cases, were positive with <b>fluindione</b> in 9 cases. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Fluindione</b> is not known to be a frequent cause of DRESS. However, the number of reports found is probably underestimated. The seriousness of DRESS, as all immuno-allergic adverse effects, contraindicates <b>fluindione</b> reintroduction. Coumarinic derivatives are the alternatives in patients who need oral anticoagulant treatment...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Among {{the vitamin}} K antagonists (VKA), indanedione-derived VKA is {{suspected}} to induce an immunoallergic risk. One indanedione-derived VKA, <b>fluindione,</b> {{is still being}} used in France. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the contribution of VKA to acute and chronic nephritis. METHODS: Twenty-four cases of biopsy proven acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) were retrospectively selected, based on a first intake of VKA within the previous 12 months as well as an increase of at least 50 % of the basal level of serum creatinine. The 24 cases were all treated with <b>fluindione</b> VKA and not with coumarinic VKA. RESULTS: The subjects studied included 20 men and 4 women, with a mean age of 73. 0 ± 9. 3 years (range: 44 - 84). The delay between <b>fluindione</b> introduction and the appearance of an AIN, proven by biopsy when available, was 11. 9 ± 6. 9 weeks (range: 3 - 28). Creatinine increased from 123. 0 ± 56. 4 μmol/L (range: 56 - 335) at <b>fluindione</b> introduction to 460. 7 ± 265. 3 μmol/L (range: 109 - 1200) at the time of AIN discovery. The treatment then consisted of stopping the <b>fluindione</b> and introducing steroids for 21 patients. If a VKA was necessary, <b>fluindione</b> was replaced by a coumarinic VKA. After 6 months, 1 patient died and 15 patients presented severe chronic kidney disease (CKD Stages 4 - 5). Two patients still required chronic dialysis after 6 months and five patients after 3 years. Patients with pre-existing kidney disease were more prone to develop severe CKD with <b>fluindione.</b> CONCLUSION: In this large study, arguments are presented to incriminate <b>fluindione</b> in the induction of acute and chronic nephritis...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC 1) and {{cytochrome}} P 450 2 C 9 (CYP 2 C 9) polymorphisms {{are taken}} into account when predicting a safe oral dose of coumarin anticoagulant therapy, but {{little is known about the}} effects of genetic predictors on the response to <b>fluindione</b> and acenocoumarol. The aims of this study were to characterize the relationship between <b>fluindione</b> and acenocoumarol concentrations and the international normalized ratio (INR) response, and to identify genetic predictors that are important for dose individualization. Methods <b>Fluindione</b> concentrations, S- and R-acenocoumarol concentrations, the INR and genotype data from healthy subjects were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model in Monolix software. Twenty-four White healthy subjects were enrolled in the pharmacogenetic study. The study was an open-label, randomized, two-period cross-over study. The subjects received two doses of an oral anticoagulant: 20 mg of <b>fluindione</b> (period A) or 4 mg of acenocoumarol (period B). The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were studied from day 2 to day 3. Results A two-compartment model with a first-order input model was selected as the base model for the two drugs. The pharmacodynamic response was best described by an indirect action model with S-acenocoumarol concentrations and <b>fluindione</b> concentrations as the only exposure predictors of the INR response. Three covariates (CYP 2 C 9 genotype, VKORC 1 genotype and body weight) were identified as important predictors for the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of S-acenocoumarol, and four covariates (CYP 2 C 9 genotype, VKORC 1 genotype, CYP 1 A 2 phenotype and body weight) were identified as predictors for the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model of <b>fluindione.</b> Because some previous studies have shown a dose-response relationship between smoking exposure and the CYP 1 A 2 phenotype, it was also noted that smokers have greater CYP 1 A 2 activity. Conclusion During initiation of therapy, CYP 2 C 9 and VKORC 1 genetic polymorphisms are important predictors of <b>fluindione</b> and acenocoumarol pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic responses. Our result suggests that it is important to take the CYP 1 A 2 phenotype into account to improve individualization of <b>fluindione</b> therapy, in addition to genetic factors...|$|E

40|$|International audience: Indandione VKAs {{have been}} widely used for decades, {{especially}} in Eastern Europe and France. Contrary to coumarin VKAs, the relative contribution of individual factors to the indandione-VKA response is poorly known. In the present multicentre study, we sought to develop and validate a model including genetic and non-genetic factors to predict the daily <b>fluindione</b> dose requirement in elderly patients in whom VKA dosing is challenging. We prospectively recorded clinical and therapeutic data in 230 Caucasian inpatients mean aged 85 ± 6 years, who had reached international normalized ratio stabilisation (range 2. 0 - 3. 0) on <b>fluindione.</b> In the derivation cohort (n= 156), we analysed 13 polymorphisms in seven genes potentially involved in the pharmacological effect or vitamin-K cycle (VKORC 1, CYP 4 F 2, EPHX 1) and <b>fluindione</b> metabolism/transport (CYP 2 C 9, CYP 2 C 19, CYP 3 A 5, ABCB 1). We built a regression model incorporating non-genetic and genetic data and evaluated the model performances in a separate cohort (n= 74). Body-weight, amiodarone intake, VKORC 1, CYP 4 F 2, ABCB 1 genotypes were retained in the final model, accounting for 31. 5 % of dose variability. None influence of CYP 2 C 9 was observed. Our final model showed good performances: in 83. 3 % of the validation cohort patients, the dose was accurately predicted within 5 mg, i. e. the usual step used for adjusting <b>fluindione</b> dosage. In conclusion, in addition to body-weight and amiodarone-intake, pharmacogenetic factors (VKORC 1,CYP 4 F 2,ABCB 1) related to the pharmacodynamic effect and transport of <b>fluindione</b> significantly influenced the dose requirement in elderly patients while CYP 2 C 9 did not.

Design: An open, multicenter, randomized study in two parallel treatment groups. Interventions: All patients received enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg s. c. twice daily, and oral <b>fluindione,</b> 20 mg once daily, either beginning on day 1 or on day 10 of the enoxaparin treatment. Enoxaparin was discontinued once the international normalized ratio under <b>fluindione</b> was stable between 2. 0 and 3. 0 over 2 days. <b>Fluindione</b> treatment was maintained during a 3 -month follow-up period. Outcome Measurements: Specific examinations (venography and/or V/Q lung scanning and/or angiography) were performed only {{in the event of}} a clinically suspected recurrence of venous thromboembolism during the 3 -month follow-up period. All cases were blindly assessed by an independent Reading Committee. Results: A clinically suspected venous thromboembolism was confirmed by objective tests in 1 of 223 patients (group of delayed introduction of fluindione; n = 111). Equivalence was demonstrated between the two treatment schedules (p < 0. 0001) for a maximal difference of 10 % (90 % confidence interval: - 2. 42 to 0. 58).

40|$|Oral {{anticoagulant}} (OA) {{therapy is}} widely used in elderly patients because of the increase of indications with age (venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation). A particularity of France is to administer three different OAs (warfarin and more often <b>fluindione</b> or acenocoumarol). In an attempt to assess the particularities of managing all three OAs in elderly patients in clinical practice, we studied the modalities of anticoagulation of 187 consecutive OA therapy patients (mean age 74. 4 years) hospitalized in an Internal Medicine department (95 patients on OA at admission and 92 patients initiated on OA during hospitalization). Patients aged 75 years or older more often required a low dosage of OA than those aged younger than 75, irrespective of the OA (warfarin and more often <b>fluindione</b> or acenocoumarol). Ambulatory patients aged 75 years or older were more susceptible to receive acenocoumarol than were ambulatory patients younger than 75 years (respectively 30 / 67 vs 8 / 28, respectively), whereas <b>fluindione</b> was prescribed at the same frequency in ambulatory patients and hospitalized patients, regardless of age group (75 : 32 / 67;, 75 : 19 / 28). In hospitalized patients with OA induction, <b>fluindione</b> was prescribed as often in patients younger than 75 than in patients aged 75 years or older (40 / 47 vs 35 / 45, respectively).

The aim {{of this study was to}} assess, in cell models, the role of ABC transporters in the intestinal transfer of the main coumarin derivatives (warfarin, acenocoumarol) and indanedione derivatives (phenindione, <b>fluindione).</b> The results show a basal to apical polarized transport for <b>fluindione,</b> phenindione and acenocoumarol only. Experimental studies using specific inhibitors of transport protein demonstrate the implication of MRPs and BCRP proteins and to a lesser extent P-gp. Warfarin and acenocoumarol seem to be poor inhibitors of MRPs protein, whereas <b>fluindione</b> and phenindione have a slight or no effect. The regulation of the expression of ABC transporters by exposure to VKAs was also investigated in Caco- 2 cells. The expression of mRNA P-gp, MRP 1, MRP 2 and BCRP was weakly or not modified after 24 h of VKAs exposure. In conclusion, the intestinal transfer of indanedione derivatives and acenocoumarol could be influenced by transport proteins of the ABC superfamily.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{quality control}} of oral {{anticoagulant}} therapy (OAT) during the initiation and maintenance treatment is generally poor. Physicians' ordering of OAT (especially <b>fluindione</b> and warfarin) {{can be improved}} by dose adjustment algorithms, {{taking into account the}} results of International Normalized Ratio (INR). Reminders at the point of care, computerized or not, have been demonstrated to be effective in changing physicians prescription behavior. However, few studies have addressed the benefit of personalized reminders versus non personalized reminders, whereas the personalized reminders require more development to access patient record data and integrate with the computerized physician order entry system. The Hospital Information System of George Pompidou European Hospital integrates an electronic medical record, lab test and drugs order entry system. This system allows to evaluate such reminders and to consider their implementation for routine use as well as the continuous evaluation of their impact on medical practice quality indicators. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the impact of two types of reminders on overtreatment by oral anticoagulant: a simple reminder of text formatted dose adjustment table and a personalized recommendation for oral anticoagulant dose and next date of INR control, adapted to patient data. Both types of reminders appear to the physician at the moment of drug ordering. Methods The study is an alternating time series experiment with three 6 months periods, each one including every 2 months according to a Latin square scheme: a control period without any reminder, a period with the simple non personalized reminder, a period with personalized reminder. All patients hospitalized in departments using the computerized physician order entry system and ordered <b>fluindione</b> or warfarin, will be included in the study between November 2004 and May 2006. Main outcome will be the proportion of overcoagulation, as expressed by the proportion of observation time with INR over 4. 5, assuming INR change linearly. Secondary outcome is the incidence of major haemorrhagic events. Data will be collected thanks to Hospital Information Systems databases.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Age {{appropriateness}} of anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To review oral anticoagulants {{for the treatment}} of atrial fibrillation in older (age > 65 years) people and to classify appropriate and inappropriate drugs based on efficacy, safety and tolerability using the Fit-fOR-The-Aged (FORTA) classification. METHODS: We performed a structured comprehensive review of controlled clinical trials and summaries of individual product characteristics to assess study and total patient numbers, quality of major outcome data and data of geriatric relevance. The resulting evidence was discussed in a round table with an interdisciplinary panel of ten European experts. Decisions on age appropriateness were made using a Delphi process. RESULTS: For the eight drugs included, 380 citations were identified. The primary outcome results were reported in 32 clinical trials with explicit and relevant data on older people. Though over 24, 000 patients aged > 75 / 80 years were studied for warfarin, data on geriatric syndromes were rare (two studies reporting on frailty/falls/mental status) and missing for all other compounds. Apixaban was rated FORTA-A (highly beneficial). Other non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (including low/high-intensity dabigatran and high-intensity edoxaban) and warfarin were assigned to FORTA-B (beneficial). Phenprocoumon, acenocoumarol and <b>fluindione</b> were rated FORTA-C (questionable), mainly reflecting the absence of data. CONCLUSIONS: All non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants and warfarin were classified as beneficial or very beneficial in older persons (FORTA-A or -B), underlining the overall positive assessment of the risk/benefit ratio for these drugs.

40|$|Rationale: Vitamin K antagonists (VKA), such as {{warfarin}} and acenocoumarol, {{are widely}} used for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic diseases and they {{are some of the}} most commonly prescribed types of medications. They are characterized by narrow therapeutic indices and inter-individual or intra-individual variability in response to the treatment. Objective: to establish the influence of several genetic factors on VKA efficacy and adverse reactions. Methods and Results: The metabolism of VKA differs depending on their chemical structure: indandiones derivatives (<b>fluindione)</b> or coumarin derivatives (acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon or warfarin). They are mostly metabolized in hepatocytes via a monooxygenase, cytochrome P 450 2 C 9 (CYP 2 C 9), resulting in inactive products. The gene encoding CYP 2 C 9 is polymorphic, its genetic variants being associated with differences in the enzymatic activity of CYP 2 C 9. The most important in terms of their frequency in the general population are CYP 2 C 9 * 2 and CYP 2 C 9 * 3. Both alleles are associated with a marked decrease in CYP 2 C 9 enzyme activity. VK epoxide reductase (VKOR) is an enzyme with an important role in VK metabolism. Various polymorphisms in the VKORC 1 gene have been described. VKORC 1 * 2 haplotype seems to be the most important in relation to the variability in response to VKA. Discussions: Various studies have shown a relationship between the genotype and the mean warfarin maintenance dosing: in patients carrying 2 C 9 * 1 / * 2 alleles, the dose is reduced by 18 - 40 % in patients carrying 2 C 9 * 2 / * 2 alleles, by 21 - 49 % in patient...|$|E

We have reviewed the literature {{to determine the}} possible interactions between seven popular herbal medicines (ginkgo, St Johns wort, ginseng, garlic, echinacea, saw palmetto and kava) and conventional drugs. Literature searches were performed using MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and EMBASE and we identified 128 case reports or case series, and 80 clinical trials. Clinical trials indicate that St Johns wort (Hypericum perforatum), via cytochrome P 450 (CYP) andor P-glycoprotein induction, reduces the plasma concentrations (andor increases the clearance) of alprazolam, amitriptyline, atorvastatin, chlorzoxazone, ciclosporin, debrisoquine, digoxin, erythromycin, fexofenadine, gliclazide, imatinib, indinavir, irinotecan, ivabradine, mephenytoin, methadone, midazolam, nifedipine, omeprazole, oral contraceptives, quazepam, simvastatin, tacrolimus, talinolol, verapamil, voriconazole and warfarin. Case reports or case series suggest interactions of St Johns wort with adrenergic vasopressors, anaesthetics, bupropion, buspirone, ciclosporin, eletriptan, loperamide, nefazodone, nevirapine, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, phenprocoumon, prednisone, sertraline, tacrolimus, theophylline, tibolone, tryptophan, venlafaxine and warfarin. Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) decreases the plasma concentrations of omeprazole, ritonavir and tolbutamide. Clinical cases indicate interactions of ginkgo with antiepileptics, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), diuretics, ibuprofen, risperidone, rofecoxib, trazodone and warfarin. Ginseng (Panax ginseng) may interact with phenelzine and warfarin. Kava (Piper methysticum) increases the clearance of chlorzoxazone (a CYP 2 E 1 substrate) and may interact with alprazolam, levodopa and paroxetine. Garlic (Allium sativum) interacts with chlorpropamide, <b>fluindione,</b> ritonavir and warfarin; it also reduces plasma concentrations of chlorzoxazone (a CYP 2 E 1 probe). Echinacea might affect the clearance of caffeine (a CYP 1 A 2 probe) and midazolam (a CYP 3 A 4 probe). No interactions have been reported for saw palmetto (Serenoa repens). Numerous interactions between herbal medicines and conventional drugs have been documented. While the significance of many interactions is uncertain, several interactions, particularly those with St Johns wort, may have serious clinical consequences. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV...|$|E

METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective, multi-centre cohort study in the United States, Canada, France, Italy, and Spain. About 1, 511 patients were randomly recruited from representative practices (routine medical care (RMC) in the US, Canada, and France; anticoagulation clinics in Italy and Spain) and data pertaining to their oral anticoagulation care were abstracted from their medical records. The predominant anticoagulant in use was warfarin in the US, Canada, and Italy; acenocoumarol in Spain; and <b>fluindione</b> in France. Documentation of care was poor in the US, Canada, and France, countries where RMC was studied. Percent INRs or time-in-therapeutic range was greater in the two anticoagulation clinic samples compared with the RMC samples. CONCLUSION: Oral anticoagulation care varies considerably from country to country. Findings suggest that anticoagulation clinic care (ACC) may provide better outcomes as assessed by international normalized ratio (INR) time-in-range. Physicians tend to under treat more than over treat. Finally, documentation of care is often inadequate. Condensed Abstract Oral anticoagulation management (routine medical care or anticoagulation clinic care) was retrospectively assessed in 5 countries using a uniform, structured assessment tool. Major management differences were detected, especially between anticoagulation clinic care and routine care. Documentation was often a problem in the latter setting. Less time in therapeutic INR range was noted in routine medical care. Findings suggest that anticoagulation clinic care may provide better outcomes as assessed by international normalized ratio (INR) time-in-range. Physicians tend to under treat more than over treat. Finally, documentation of care is often inadequate...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) {{are known}} to act as teratogens; however, there is still {{uncertainty}} about the relative risk for birth defects and the most sensitive period. In a multi-centre (n = 12), observational, prospective study we compared 666 pregnant women exposed to phenprocoumon (n = 280), acenocoumarol (n = 226), <b>fluindione</b> (n = 99), warfarin (n = 63) and phenindione (n = 2) to a non-exposed control group (n = 1, 094). Data were collected by institutes collaborating in the European Network of Teratology Information Services (ENTIS) during individual risk counselling between 1988 and 2004. Main outcome measures were coumarin embryopathy and other birth defects, miscarriage rate, birth-weight, and prematurity. The rate of major birth defects after 1 st trimester exposure was significantly increased (OR 3. 86, 95 % CI 1. 86 - 8. 00). However, {{there were only two}} coumarin embryopathies (0. 6 %; both phenprocoumon). Prematurity was more frequent (16. 0 % vs. 7. 6 %, OR 2. 61, 95 % CI 1. 76 - 3. 86), mean gestational age at delivery (37. 9 vs. 39. 4, p< 0. 001), and mean birth weight of term infants (3, 166 g vs. 3, 411 g; p < 0. 001) were lower compared to the controls. Using the methodology of survival analysis, miscarriage rate reached 42 % vs. 14 % (hazard ratio 3. 36; 95 % CI 2. 28 - 4. 93). In conclusion, use of VKA during pregnancy increases the risk of structural defects and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. The risk for coumarin embryopathy is, however, very small, in particular when therapy during the 1 (st) trimester did not take place later than week 8 after the 1 (st) day of the last menstrual period. Therefore, elective termination of a wanted pregnancy is not recommended if (inadvertent) exposure took place in early pregnancy. Close follow-up by the obstetrician including level II ultrasound should be recommended in any case of VKA exposure during pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Clinical {{data are}} {{urgently}} needed {{to specify the}} risk and safety of drug use during pregnancy. For several reasons pregnant women are usually excluded from clinical studies. Therefore, observational data are {{the main source of}} knowledge, cohort studies as well as case-control studies. Pregnant women and health care professionals of various disciplines, in particular obstetricians and geneticists seek advice from Teratology Information Services (TIS) on drug risks during pregnancy. Consultations on drug exposure during pregnancy require a differential approach dependent on the type of inquiry: (1) recommendations on drugs of choice for a particular disease must consider the effectiveness in treating the disease and the safety for the unborn child; (2) risk assessment of a past drug exposure during pregnancy requires a careful risk quantification to prevent unnecessary interventions such as termination of pregnancy or invasive diagnostic procedures. The Berlin Institute for clinical teratology collects follow up data on the course of drug exposed pregnancies during individual risk counseling. Apart from such prospectively enrolled datasets retrospective case reports of abnormal pregnancy outcome are recorded separately. These two databases allow evaluation of relative risks for several pregnancy outcome parameters and the detection of specific pattern of anomalies. Based on the Berlin database and on similar databases from other European TIS collaborating in the European Network of Teratology Information Services (ENTIS) four studies on drug safety are presented. A total of 549 pregnancies exposed to quinolone antibiotics were collected by ENTIS. The malformation rate among the live-born babies was 4. 8 %. No specific patterns of congenital abnormalities were found. The results do not suggest an elevated risk for spontaneous abortion, prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, birth defects and postnatal disorders. Hence, termination of pregnancy because of such exposure is not indicated. To assess the safety of calcium channel blockers during the first trimester of pregnancy. a multicenter prospective observational study was performed. The rate of major birth defects was compared between a cohort of pregnant women exposed to calcium channel blockers during the first trimester (n = 299) and a control group not exposed to potential teratogens (n = 806). Major birth defects were not more common in the study group than in the control group. Birth weight was significantly lower in exposed term newborns. There were more preterm infants in the study group than in the control group (23. 8 % vs. 6. 5 %). These adverse effects are more likely due to the underlying disease than to the medication. Vitamin K antagonists are known to act as teratogens; however, there is still uncertainty about the relative risk for birth defects and the most sensitive period. In a multi-centre, observational, prospective study we compared 666 pregnant women exposed to phenprocoumon (n= 280), acenocoumarol (n= 226), <b>fluindione</b> (n= 99), warfarin (n= 63) and phenindione (n= 2) to a non-exposed control group (n= 1, 094). Data were collected by institutes collaborating in (ENTIS). Main outcome measures were coumarin embryopathy and other birth defects, miscarriage rate, birth-weight, and prematurity. The rate of major birth defects after 1 st trimester exposure was significantly increased (OR 3. 86, 95 % CI 1. 86 – 8. 00). However, there were only two coumarin embryopathies (0. 6 %; both phenprocoumon). Prematurity was more frequent (16. 0 % vs. 7. 6 %, OR 2. 61, 95 % CI 1. 76 – 3. 86), mean gestational age at delivery (37. 9 vs. 39. 4, p< 0. 001), and mean birth weight of term infants (3, 166 g vs. 3, 411 g; p< 0. 001) were lower compared to the controls. Using the methodology of survival analysis, miscarriage rate reached 42 % vs. 14 % (hazard ratio 3. 36; 95 % CI 2. 28 – 4. 93). In conclusion, use of VKA during pregnancy increases the risk of structural defects and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. The risk for coumarin embryopathy is, however, very small, in particular when therapy during the 1 st trimester did not take place later than week 8 after the 1 st day of the last menstrual period. Therefore, elective termination of a wanted pregnancy is not recommended if (inadvertent) exposure took place in early pregnancy. Spontaneous abortion rates are of general interest when investigating pregnancy outcome. In most studies observations are left truncated as pregnant women enter with a delay of several weeks after conception. Apart from spontaneous abortion pregnancy may end in induced abortion or live birth. These outcomes are considered as competing events (risks). The authors propose simple methods which remove bias inherent to crude rates. The probability of spontaneous abortion is estimated using an event-history based approach for the sub-distribution of competing risks that handles left truncation appropriately. Variance estimation enables the construction of approximate confidence intervals and of a simple test-statistic for comparing rates between different cohorts. The proposed methods are applied to a comparative prospective study on the association of spontaneous abortion and exposure to coumarin derivatives. The naive analysis using crude rates gives substantially different results than those based on the proposed methods, with up to a twofold change. Apart from thalidomide, retinoids like isotretinoin are the strongest teratogens in humans known today. The overall risk of birth defects is estimated as up to 30 % after exposure during embryogenesis. In spite of well established pregnancy prevention programs, pregnancies still occur during isotretinoin therapy in many countries including Germany. The Berlin Institute for Clinical Teratology documents prospectively the course of drug-exposed pregnancies when contacted for individual drug risk assessment. A total of 108 pregnancies exposed to systemic isotretinoin (median dosage 20 mg/day) during the contraindicated period were prospectively registered by TIS Berlin. 76 % (69 / 91) of the pregnancies with known outcome were electively terminated— mainly for fear of medication risk. No terminations due to abnormal prenatal ultrasound were reported. Spontaneous abortions occurred in 5 pregnancies. Of 18 live births including 1 pair of twins 1 major birth defect (small ventricular septal defect) was observed. None of the infants showed symptoms of retinoid embryopathy. 70 % (48 / 69) of the patients with data on contraception did not use any method, in 30 % contraception failed. There was no evidence that poor maternal education was a major cause for the omission of contraception documented in 48 women...|$|E
