Technical challenges associated with drilling in very deep water of about 6900 meters [...] were overcome enabling borehole stress measurements, recovery of valuable core samples of the plate-boundary fault zone and collection of unique temperature measurements. The results of the scientific investigations show that the huge slip during the 2011 Tohoku earthquake occurred on a simple and thin fault zone composed of pelagic sediments with a high smectite content. Both laboratory experiments on the fault zone material and temperature measurements across the fault zone, show that the <b>friction</b> <b>level</b> was very low during the earthquake. The localized fault zone, low friction properties of its material and complete stress drop during the earthquake, are important characteristics that likely contributed to the huge slip during the earthquake.|$|E

In this paper, an optimal path is found by optimising the sequence of actuator requests during the manoeuvres. Particular attention is paid to how the vehicle control strategy depends on friction. This study shows that the actuation of all the forces and torques on and around the vehicle centre of gravity is approximately scaled with friction, whereas at individual wheel level, the optimal force allocation will differ under different friction conditions. A lower <b>friction</b> <b>level</b> leads to lower velocities and load transfer, which influences the individual wheels’ tyre force constraints. However, the actuator response compared to the whole system is increased at a lower <b>friction</b> <b>level...</b>|$|E

40|$|When {{dealing with}} {{high-tech}} equipment, accurate positioning {{is of the}} utmost importance to ensure durability and a productive lifetime. Unexpected high friction or wear of positioning mechanisms can lead to unnecessary down-time or products that are not up to specification. To ensure a sufficient lifetime, it is necessary to know beforehand how the sliding and rolling contacts will behave over time. This demand becomes more stringent when the machine operates at extreme conditions, e. g. vacuum or extremely low temperatures. Traditional greases and mineral oil based lubricants do not perform adequately in such extreme environments, as they either contaminate the vacuum or do not provide sufficient film thickness. TNO recently developed a unique measuring application, the TNO cryotribometer, in order to measure friction and wear of position mechanisms at harsh conditions. Preliminary results show that the contact pressure and the sliding velocity influenced the <b>friction</b> <b>level</b> greatly.

Friction estimation methods have been proposed earlier for driving conditions {{in the presence of}} a slip angle or slip ratio. However, the estimation of the friction from a freely-rolling tire is still an unsolved topic. Knowing the existing friction potential would be beneficial since vehicle control systems could be adjusted before any remarkable tire force has been produced. Since accelerometers are well-known and robust, and thus a promising sensor type for intelligent tires, this study uses three three-axis IEPE accelerometers on the inner liner of a tire to detect friction potential indicators on two equally smooth surfaces with different <b>friction</b> <b>levels.</b> The equal roughness was chosen for both surfaces in order to study the friction phenomena by neglecting the effect of surface texture on vibrations. The acceleration data before the contact is used to differentiate the two <b>friction</b> <b>levels</b> between the tire and the road. In addition, the contact lengths from the three accelerometers are used to validate the acceleration data. A method to differentiate the <b>friction</b> <b>levels</b> on the basis of the acceleration signal is also introduced...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this article}} was to assess how {{intraoral}} biodegradation influenced the surface characteristics and <b>friction</b> <b>levels</b> of metallic brackets used during 12 and 24 months of orthodontic treatment and also to compare the static friction generated in these brackets with four different methods of the ligation of orthodontic wires. Material and Methods: Seventy premolar brackets as received from the manufacturer and 224 brackets that were used in previous orthodontic treatments were evaluated in this experiment. The surface morphology and the composition of the deposits found in the brackets were evaluated with rugosimetry, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Friction was analyzed by applying tensile tests simulating sliding mechanics with a 0. 019 x 0. 025 " steel wire. The static <b>friction</b> <b>levels</b> produced by the following ligation methods were evaluated: loosely attached steel ligature around all four bracket wings, steel ligature attached to only two wings, conventional elastomeric ligation around all 4 bracket wings, and non-conventional Slide&# 174; elastomeric ligature. Results: The results demonstrated the presence of biodegradation effects such as corrosion pits, plastic deformation, cracks, and material deposits. The main chemical elements found on these deposits were Carbon and Oxygen. The maximum friction produced by each ligation method changed according to the time of intraoral use. The steel ligature loosely attached to all four bracket wings produced the lowest <b>friction</b> <b>levels</b> in the new brackets. The conventional elastic ligatures generated the highest <b>friction</b> <b>levels.</b> The metallic brackets underwent significant degradation during orthodontic treatment, showing an increase in surface roughness and the deposit of chemical elements on the surface.

40|$|Geometrical and {{chemical}} {{changes in the}} wear track can cause a drift in <b>friction</b> <b>level.</b> In this paper, chemical and geometrical surface changes in wear tracks are analyzed. For this, a setup with a confocal height sensor was developed to measure the local height changes on the wear track, combined with confocal Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical changes at the surfaces. Pin-on-disc experiments were performed at room temperature and at elevated temperature (600 °C) to understand the material behavior between mild and severe wear regimes. The wear tracks developing between the two ceramics, alumina (Al 2 O 3) and zirconia (Y-TZP), were analyzed using these techniques. The results of confocal height sensor showed significantly more geometrical changes in surface roughness at 600 °C compared to the test conducted at room temperature. The developed roughness in the wear track was approximately 250 times larger at 600 °C due to the higher degradation of the mechanical properties of ceramic. Further, material transfer was observed for the test conducted at 600 °C using Raman Spectroscopy. Material transfer at room temperature is difficult to observe because surface changes are less evident in mild wear regimes.

40|$|Road surface friction, such as all {{pavement}} surface characteristics, undergoes to a degradation through time. The {{prediction of}} friction progression with time represents a key topic in pavement maintenance {{since it is}} important for road managers to know where and when the maintenance intervention is needed in order to restore a satisfactory <b>friction</b> <b>level</b> and, as a results, to guarantee an adequate road safety. For these reasons, it is necessary to quantify how road friction decreases with the increase of time and in which manner it is affected by different factors involved in the degradation phenomenon, among which heavy commercial vehicle traffic flow and spectrum play a critical role. To this purpose, following a brief review of skid resistance degradation models available in literature, a friction deterioration model has been derived from site measurements carried out in a dual carriageway road within the Naples area. Traffic flow and spectrum monitoring, on one hand, and friction (through British Pendulum) and macrotexture (through Sand Patch method) measurements, on the other, have been performed for almost two years on a conventional asphalt concrete wearing course and on an experimental high performance modified asphalt concrete mix. By making use of the differential surface wear occurring in the transversal direction due to the variability of lateral position of vehicular traffic, it has been possible to derive a friction deterioration model for both wearing courses within a reasonably short period of time according to two equivalence damage criteria. Preliminary numerical analysis seems to confirm that a strong relationship exists between friction values and cumulated traffic expressed in terms of equivalent light vehicles for both the bituminous mixes if an equivalence damage criterion based on total tyre footprint area of vehicle is adopted. Furthermore, <b>friction</b> <b>level</b> provided by the highperformance mix appears to be always larger than that provided by the conventional asphalt concrete wearing course...|$|E

The {{application is}} primarily to systems with a vertically-oriented single-bearing support, but extension is also made to horizontally-oriented single-bearing support as typically {{found in a}} vehicle wheel. The rotor elastic mounting includes three translational degrees of freedom for the body geometric center and three rotational degrees of freedom.

40|$|Maintenance cost {{is one of}} the {{important}} issues in railway heavy haul operations. For the iron-ore company LKAB, these costs are mainly associated with the reprofiling and changing of the wheels of the locomotives and wagons. The main reason for the wheel damages is usually surface initiated rolling contact fatigue (RCF) on the wheels. The present work tries to enhance and improve the knowledge of the vehicle-track interaction of the Swedish iron-ore freight wagons and locomotives used at Malmbanan. The study is divided into two parts. Firstly, it is tried to get into the roots of RCF using the simulation model of the iron ore wagon (Paper A). Secondly, the study is focused on predicting wear and RCF on the locomotive wheels also via a dynamic simulation model (Paper B). In the first paper, some key issues of the dynamic modelling of the wagons with three piece bogies are first discussed and then parameter studies are carried out to find the most important reasons of wheel damages. These parameter studies include track design geometry, track irregularities, wheel-rail <b>friction</b> <b>level,</b> cant deficiency and track stiffness. The results show a significant effect of the <b>friction</b> <b>level</b> on the amount of RCF risk. As the locomotive wheel life is much shorter than that of the wagons, LKAB has decided to change the locomotive wheel profile. Two final wheel profiles are proposed; however, one had to be approved for the field tests. In the second paper, the long term evolution of the two profiles is compared via wear simulation analysis. Also, the RCF evolution on the wheel profiles as a function of running distance is discussed. The process is first carried out for the current locomotive wheel profiles and the results are compared with the measurements. Good agreement is achieved. Finally, one of the proposed profiles is suggested for the field test because of the mild wear and RCF propagation. QC 20150210 </p...|$|E
40|$|Real-time {{information}} about the current tyre-road friction coefficient is important for vehicles with increasing levels of automation to adapt intervention thresholds and vehicle velocity. Online friction estimation poses large challenges in terms of availability and accuracy of the estimate. When estimating the friction based on the slip and force of a tyre, {{the accuracy of the}} estimate depends on the current tyre friction utilisation. This paper presents a method to evaluate how large tyre force excitation that is required to estimate the current <b>friction</b> <b>level</b> within a given error using an effectbased approach. The results indicate that large variations in the required utilisation should be expected for different tyre and road surface combinations when tyre models that only have the slip stiffness and the friction coefficient as parameters (e. g. brush tyre model) are used in the observer to estimate the friction coefficient. For the brush tyre model it varied from 54 % in the best case to 94 % in the worst case. To illustrate the benefit of quantification of required utilisation an example use of an estimator based on the brush tyre model is shown in the end of this paper. A simulation is performed to show how fast a sudden drop in friction during braking can be detected using a recursive online estimator. The results show that the estimator is able to detect the change in friction and converge to the new <b>friction</b> <b>level</b> in 0. 06 s, which is fast enough to potentially improve the performance of ABS systems of trucks. Tyre models for online friction estimation must hence be chosen with the intended use in mind.

The {{internal}} friction of the hyperstabilized martensite demonstrates very low values, both {{above and below}} the nominal martensitic transformation temperature, due to a pronounced pinning effect. Over a wide temperature range it is comparable with the level of damping in the parent phase. A study of the temperature dependence of the non-linear ultrasonic {{internal friction}} and its strain amplitude hysteresis indicates that the diffusion, assisted by dislocations/interfaces, is quite pronounced and in Ni-Fe-Ga and Cu-Al-Be alloys it operates at temperatures around 20 K.

Based on this approach in the paper, we report on (1) laser surface microstructuring of hydrogenated a-C:H and hydrogen-free ta-C films in the regime of surface graphitization using UV laser pulses of 20 -ns duration and (2) correlation between the structure and friction properties of the laser-patterned DLC surface on micro/nanoscale using SPM/LFM technique. The SPM/LFM data obtained for the surface relief gratings of graphitized microstructures have evidenced lower friction forces in the laser-graphitized regions. For the hydrogenated DLC films, the reversible frictional behavior of the laser-graphitized micropatterns is found to take place during LFM imaging at different temperatures (20 and 120 °C) in ambient air. It is revealed that the lateral force distribution in the laser-graphitized areas is shifted to higher <b>friction</b> <b>levels</b> (relative {{to that of the}} unirradiated surface) at temperature 120 °C and returned back to the lower friction during the sample cooling to 20 °C, thus confirming an influence of adsorbed water layers on the nanofriction properties of laser-graphitized micropatterns on the film surface...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{demonstrates}} that the vehicle sideslip can be estimated through the kinematic relationship of velocity measurements from two low-cost GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers. To compensate for the low update rate of low-cost GPS receivers, acceleration/angular rate measurements from an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) are merged with the GPS measurements using an Extended Kalman Filter. Two technical challenges were addressed: (i) unsynchronized updates of the two GPS receivers and (ii) significant delays in GPS velocity measurement. A stochastic observability analysis reveals that the proposed method guarantees the observability when a vehicle has non-zero yaw rates. Experimental verification shows that the vehicle sideslip is estimated regardless of surface <b>friction</b> <b>levels</b> under several maneuvers...|$|R
40|$|In 2003, the Indiana Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration {{allowed a}} test section of Porous Friction Course (PFC) {{to be placed}} on I 74 east of Indianapolis. The design, {{construction}} and early performance of that surface were compared to an adjacent SMA surface and a conventional Superpave HMA surface in a report prepared for the Institute for Safe, Quiet and Durable Highways (1). The early performance indicated that the PFC offered several advantages over the SMA and the conventional surfaces, including reduced tire/pavement noise, high friction and surface texture, and reduced splash and spray. There was a concern, however, that porous surfaces can lose their porosity, and therefore their performance advantages, over time. Consequently, the project summarized in this report was planned to continue monitoring the performance of the PFC and the comparison surfaces in order to investigate the durability of the porous surface over a five-year period (after construction). After five years under traffic, there have indeed been some changes in these properties. Most of the changes, however, took place quickly as the asphalt binder film coating the exposed aggregate particles was worn off by traffic. Since then, the changes have been relatively minor. The PFC section is still significantly quieter than the adjacent SMA section to which it has been compared. The PFC has retained most of its texture and is still providing good <b>friction</b> <b>levels.</b> Both the PFC and the SMA are still in very good condition with little distress and have higher <b>friction</b> <b>levels</b> than a section of dense graded asphalt constructed with similar materials that has also been evaluated {{for the duration of the}} study...|$|R
