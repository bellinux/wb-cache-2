5|$|Maurius Pacheco Fernandes {{was born}} in Georgetown, <b>Demerara,</b> British Guiana on 12 August 1897. He played for the <b>Demerara</b> Cricket Club as a teenager, gaining a {{reputation}} as a good cricketer, and made his debut for British Guiana during the 1922 Inter-Colonial Tournament, facing Trinidad. Playing as an opening batsman, Fernandes scored a duck in his first innings, but made 25 runs in the second.|$|E
5|$|The British {{transferred}} rule of <b>Demerara</b> to the Dutch in 1802 {{under the}} terms of the Peace of Amiens, but took back control of it a year later. In 1812, the British merged <b>Demerara</b> and Essequibo into the colony of Demerara-Essequibo. The colonies were ceded to Britain by treaty between the Netherlands and Britain on 13 August 1814. Stabroek, as the colony's capital was known under the Dutch, was renamed as Georgetown in 1812. The colonial powers appointed a governor to rule in their stead, and the local legislation was decided on by a Court of Policy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Demerara</b> {{was first}} colonised by the Dutch in the 17th century {{under the auspices}} of the Dutch West India Company (DWIC). The economy, {{initially}} based on trade, began to be superseded in the 18th century by sugar cane cultivation on large plantations. The <b>Demerara</b> region was opened to settlement in 1746, and new opportunities attracted British settlers from nearby Barbados. By 1760, they had become the largest contingent in Demerara; the 1762 business registers showed that 34 of 93 plantations owned by Englishmen. The British were a major external threat to Dutch control over the colonies from 1781 until 1796, when Britain obtained de facto control. Following a raid by privateers in February 1781, British occupation lasted until January 1782, when the island was recaptured by the French, then allied with the Dutch.|$|E
40|$|The woolly mouse opossum Marmosa <b>demerarae</b> and the murine opossum, Marmosa murina, {{occur in}} sympatry across {{most of their}} range; however, they are not syntopic in that M. <b>demerarae</b> is more {{abundant}} in the canopy of primary and secondary forest, while M. murina is scansorial {{and appears to be}} more abundant in lower forest strata. We herein present a survey and comparison of the helminths occurring in these 2 species in French Guiana based on examinations of 18 individuals of M. murina and 21 individuals of M. <b>demerarae.</b> At the level of the component community, species richness was established at 12 for M. <b>demerarae</b> and 14 for M. murina; the nematodes Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines) elegans and Aspidodera raillieti were established as the most abundant and prevalent species in M. <b>demerarae</b> and M. murina, respectively. Infracommunities in both species had an average species richness of 3. 7 and 3. 8, respectively. Both species share 12 species of parasites, yet Phaneropsolus philanderi, Pterygodermatites (Paucipectines) elegans, Travassostrongylus paraquintus, Trichuris reesali, and Spirura trinitatis were significantly more frequent in M. <b>demerarae.</b> Infections also included Mathevotaenia bivittata, an unidentified anoplocephalid, and Viannaia venezuelensis, all 3 species of which were more frequent in M. murina...|$|R
40|$|Summary. – As {{little is}} known of the feeding ecology of Neotropical marsupials, we studied the food habits and the role in seed {{dispersal}} of two sympatric didelphid marsupials, Lutreolina crassicaudata and Micoureus <b>demerarae</b> in Southern Brazil. The study area is on Santa Catarina Island, in secondary Atlantic Forest. As {{a part of a}} two-year (1998 - 2000) study, animals were trapped and their feces collected on the ground and in the understory for a six months period (March to August 1998) on a grid of 127 traps. L. crassicaudata was trapped only on the ground, mainly near a creek, and M. <b>demerarae,</b> mainly in the understory. Thirteen fecal samples of L. crassicaudata were collected, and 30 for M. <b>demerarae.</b> L. crassicaudata consumed mainly crabs and beetles, whilst M. <b>demerarae</b> consumed mainly beetles and ants. Invertebrate diversity was high in the diet of both species, particularly that of L. crassicaudata. Conversely, fruit diversity eaten was low, but highest for M. <b>demerarae.</b> L. crassicaudata ate more seeds (e. g. Cecropia) than did M. <b>demerarae.</b> The dietary overlap between these two marsupials was high (96 %), and both species are thought to be seed dispersers in their respective habitats.

5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{took place}} {{a few months}} after the founding of the Anti-Slavery Society, and had a strong impact on Britain. Although public sentiment initially favoured the colonists, it changed with revelations. The abolitionist debate which had flagged, was galvanised by the deaths of Smith and the 250 slaves. The Martial law in <b>Demerara</b> was lifted on 19 January 1824. In <b>Demerara</b> and Berbice, there was considerable anger towards the missionaries that resulted in their oppression. Demerara's Court of Policy passed an ordinance giving financial assistance to a church that was selected by plantation owners in each district. The Le Resouvenir chapel was seized and taken over by the Anglican Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{mainstay}} of its economy was sugar, grown on cane plantations worked by slaves. The {{sale of the}} crop in Britain enjoyed preferential terms. There were 2,571 declared slaves working on 68 plantations in Essequibo, and 1,648 slaves in <b>Demerara</b> in 1762. These numbers {{were known to be}} much understated, as the slave headcount was the basis of taxation. By 1769, there were 3,986 declared slaves for Essequibo's 92 plantations and 5,967 for Demerara's 206 plantations. The slave labour was in short supply and expensive due to the trading monopoly of the DWIC, and smuggling from Barbados was rife. Dutch colonists ensured white dominance over their growing slave population through the collaboration of indigenous natives, who strongly resisted white domination but could also be relied upon to take up arms against any Spanish incursions. When slaves rose up in Berbice in 1763, natives blocked the border to prevent the disruption from spreading into <b>Demerara.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout Bristol's {{history the}} Avon Gorge {{has been an}} {{important}} transport route, carrying the River Avon, major roads and two railways. The Bristol Channel and Avon estuary have a very high tidal range of , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering, making it notoriously difficult to navigate.

5|$|By 1895 Venezuela had had {{a dispute}} with the United Kingdom about the {{territory}} of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, for over half a century. The territorial claims were originally those of the Spanish Empire (inherited by Venezuela after its independence in 1830) and of the Dutch Empire (inherited by the United Kingdom with the acquisition of the Dutch territories of Essequibo, <b>Demerara</b> and Berbice in 1814), having remained unsettled over previous centuries.

5|$|Graduating {{from playing}} at the <b>Demerara</b> Cricket Club as a teenager, to play for British Guiana in 1922, Fernandes took part in tours of England in 1923 and 1928. He made his debut Test {{appearance}} during the 1928 tour, playing {{in the first of}} the three Tests. His next, and final Test match came during the English tour of the West Indies in 1930. At the time, the West Indies had a practice of picking their captain from the colony that the match was being played in, and Fernandes was granted the honour for the match in British Guiana. The West Indies won the match, their maiden victory in Test cricket. After the match, Fernandes only played one further first-class match, and retired from first-class cricket in 1932.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from London, the <b>Demerara</b> Court of Policy eventually passed an 'Ordinance for the religious instruction of slaves and for meliorating their condition' in 1825 which institutionalised working hours and some civil rights for slaves. The weekend {{was to be}} from sunset on Saturday to sunrise on Monday; field work was also defined to be from 6 am to 6 pm, with a mandatory two-hour break. A Protector of Slaves was appointed; whipping was abolished for women as was its use in the field. The rights to marriage and own property was legalised, as was the right to acquire manumission. Amendments and new ordinances continued to flow from London, each progressively establishing more civil rights for the slaves, but they were strongly resisted by the colonial legislature.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- Diet of six {{species of}} small mammals (five {{marsupials}} and one rodent) was studied through analysing {{a total of}} 163 fecal samples obtained from live-trapping in Atlantic Forest fragments at Poço das Antas, Brazil, 1995 - 1999. For the marsupial Micoureus <b>demerarae</b> the most frequent food itens were arthropods from the orders Coleoptera and Hymenoptera, pupae and larvae of Diptera and Lepidoptera, and seeds of plants from secondary vegetation; freshwater crustaceans were also recorded. Caluromys philander also consumed mostly Coleoptera, Hymenoptera and seeds from secondary plants, but seeds were less diverse, more frequent and more abundant than for M. <b>demerarae.</b> Patterns recorded for the remaining marsupials included the importance of termites for Metachirus nudicaudatus, presence of a vertebrate (rodent) only for Philander frenata, and a diverse diet for Didelphis aurita despite a small sample size.

40|$|A dieta de Micoureus <b>demerarae</b> (Thomas, 1905) foi estudada em bosques de mangue e terra firme através de amostras estomacais e fecais. O número de indivíduos capturados foi inversamente proporcional à disponibilidade de frutos e insetos, sendo Coleoptera e Hemiptera as ordens de artrópodes mais consumidos e Passifloraceae e Arecaceae os frutos mais ingeridos. Desse modo, tanto a maior variabilidade de frutos como a alta produção destes durante a estação seca, parecem explicar o aumento da captura desses animais nos bosques de terra firme, dos quais são originalmente provenientes. Os itens alimentares sugerem que esta espécie possui uma dieta do tipo onívora, independentemente da sazonalidade ou distribuição dos recursos disponíveis.

50|$|This process, common amongst plants, is termed allelopathy. In {{the case}} of Duroia hirsuta, the {{chemical}} inhibitor is aided by the Lemon Ant, a resident on and in the tree, and playing {{an active role in}} suppressing and destroying plant growth in the vicinity of their host by injecting and spraying formic acid, and defending against herbivores - other ant species such as Azteca spp. and Allomerus octoarticulatus <b>demerarae</b> exhibit the same mutualism. The area around this understory tree is often devoid of all other plant types, leading to the local name 'Devil's garden'. The cost to the host plant for this protection is considerable, since the resident ants subject the tree to increased leaf cutting. Trees that grow outside the cleared area often have the living tissues of their trunks excavated and galled for ant accommodation.|$|R

40|$|Exploring {{the factors}} {{governing}} the maintenance and breakdown {{of cooperation between}} mutualists is an intriguing and enduring problem for evolutionary ecology, and symbioses between ants and plants can provide useful experimental models for such studies. Hundreds of tropical plant species have evolved structures to house and feed ants, and these ant^plant symbioses have long been considered classic exam-ples of mutualism. Here, we report that the primary ant symbiont, Allomerus cf. <b>demerarae,</b> of the most abundant ant-plant found in south-east Peru, Cordia nodosa Lam., castrates its host plant. Allomerus workers protect new leaves and their associated domatia from herbivory, but destroy £owers, reducing fruit production to zero in most host plants. Castrated plants occupied by Allomerus provide more domatia for their associated ants than plants occupied by three species of Azteca ants that do not castrate their hosts. Allomerus colonies in larger plants have higher fecundity. As a consequence, Allomerus appears to bene¢t from its castration behaviour, {{to the detriment of}} C. nodosa. The C. nodosa^ant system exhibits none of the retaliatory or ¢ltering mechanisms shown to stabilize cheating in other cooperative systems, and appears to persist because some of the plants, albeit a small minority, are inhabited by the three species of truly mutualistic Azteca ants...|$|R
30|$|The {{marsupial}} G. agilis was {{the most}} common species captured in ipucas. In contrast, P. opossum was only captured three times in ipucas, and D. albiventris was only captured once in the Cerrado matrix. Thus, there is an apparent scarcity of marsupial species in these natural forested fragments, despite the fact that several other species of marsupials (e.g. Caluromys philander, D. marsupialis, Marmosa murina, Marmosa <b>demerarae)</b> have been captured in gallery forests of the Araguaia River (Bezerra et al. [2009]; Rocha et al. [2011]). D’Andrea et al. ([2007]) argued that the absence of marsupials from agro-ecosystems in the Atlantic Forest is probably related to the lack of major continuous forests, which are the favoured habitats of several didelphid species (Emmons and Feer [1997]). This pattern was also reported by Barros-Battesti et al. ([2000]) in isolated remnants of Atlantic Forest. On the other hand, Cáceres et al. ([2010]) argued that marsupials sometimes dominated in abundance or richness in the smaller fragments of woodland and gallery forests in Cerrado, G. agilis being one of the species that contribute to this dominance (Cáceres et al. [2010]; Napoli and Cáceres [2012]). Although G. agilis is an arboreal species, like several other didelphid species (Emmons and Feer [1997]), its small size and its broad habitat tolerance (Cáceres et al. [2010]) make it more adapted to fragmented habitats, such as ipucas.|$|R

40|$|Patterns of {{vertical}} stratification and canopy utilization by rodents and marsupials were analysed in two contiguous Atlantic forests at different altitudes (100 m and 900 m asl). Twenty-two species were captured using live traps placed at ground level, in the understorey (1. 5 - 2. 0 m), {{and in the}} canopy (6 - 15 m) over 2 y; seven species (32 %) were mainly or exclusively arboreal. Community composition and relative abundance of species in the different vertical strata were not similar, with a general {{reduction in the number}} of species, and in abundance in the upper layers. The following species were captured mainly or exclusively in the canopy: Micoureus <b>demerarae</b> and Gracilinanus microtarsus (Didelphimorphia, Didelphidae); Wilfredomys pictipes, Oecomys aff. concolor, and Rhipidomys aff. macrurus (Rodentia, Muridae); and Nelomys nigrispinus (Rodentia, Echimyidae). Our results indicated that altitudinal changes in Atlantic forest areas may alter the community composition of different forest layers but they do not seem to alter greatly specific patterns {{of vertical}} habitat utilization. Similar-sized species tended to differ in their patterns of vertical utilization of habitat with the exception of terrestrial akodontine rodents (genera Akodon, Thaptomys, Oxymycterus and Brucepattersonius). Rodents (mainly Oryzomys russatus) dominated captures at ground level at both sites but Akodonti-nii were numerous only at the highest site. Unlike other neotropical forests, marsupials did not dominate canopy captures...|$|R
40|$|Ecological {{theory has}} long {{supported}} {{the idea that}} species coexistence in a homogeneous habitat is promoted by spatial structure, but empirical evidence for this hypothesis has lagged behind theory. Here we describe a Neotropical ant-plant symbiosis that is ideally suited for testing spatial models of coexistence. Two genera of ants, Allomerus cf. <b>demerarae</b> and three species of Azteca are specialized to live on a single species of ant-plant, Cordia nodosa, in a Western Amazonian tropical rain forest. Empirically, using census data from widely separated localities, we show that the relative colonization abilities of the two ant genera are a function of plant density. A parameterized model shows that this pattern alone is sufficiently robust to explain coexistence in the system. Census and experimental data suggest that Azteca queens are better long-distance flyers, but that Allomerus colonies are more fecund. Thus, Azteca can dominate in areas where host-plant densities are low (and parent colony-sapling distances are long), and Allomerus can dominate in areas where host-plant densities are high. Existing spatial heterogeneity in host-plant densities therefore can allow regional coexistence, and intersite dispersal can produce local mixing. In conclusion, a dispersal-fecundity trade-off appears to allow the two genera to treat spatial heterogeneity in patch density as a niche axis. This study further suggests that a spatially structured approach is essential in understanding the persistence of some mutualisms {{in the presence of}} parasites...|$|R
40|$|The {{riverine}} barrier model {{suggests that}} rivers {{play a significant}} role in separating widespread organisms into isolated populations. In this study, we used a comparative approach to investigate the phylogeography of 6 didelphid marsupial species in central Brazil. Specifically, we evaluate the role of the mid-Araguaia River in differentiating populations and estimate divergence time among lineages to assess the timing of differentiation of these species, using mitochondrial DNA sequence data. The 6 didelphid marsupials revealed different intraspecific genetic patterns and structure. The 3 larger and more generalist species, Didelphis albiventris, Didelphis marsupialis, and Philander opossum, showed connectivity across the Araguaia River. In contrast the genetic structure of the 3 smaller and specialist species, Gracilinanus agilis, Marmosa (Marmosa) murina, and Marmosa (Micoureus) <b>demerarae</b> was shaped by the mid-Araguaia. Moreover, the split of eastern and western bank populations of the 2 latter species is consistent with the age of Araguaia River sediments formation. We hypothesize that the role of the Araguaia as a riverine barrier is linked to the level of ecological specialization among the 6 didelphid species and differences in their ability to cross rivers or disperse through the associated habitat types.
