50|$|Leadership is {{a central}} {{challenge}} in virtual teams. Particularly, all kinds of direct control are difficult when team managers are not at the same location as the team members. As a consequence, delegative management principles are considered that shift parts of classic managerial functions to the team members. However, team members only accept and fulfill such managerial functions when they are motivated and identify with the team and its goals, which is again more difficult to achieve in virtual teams. Next, empirical results on three leadership approaches are summarized that differ {{in the degree of}} autonomy of the team members: Electronic monitoring as an attempt to realize directive leadership over <b>distance,</b> <b>management</b> by objectives (MBO) as an example for delegative leadership principles, and self-managing teams as an example for rather autonomous teamwork.|$|E

In this experimental study I investigate how social presence could influence {{the degree to which}} people show behavioral conformation in virtual environments (VEs).

The participants who felt stronger social presence maintained a shorter distance when they enacted the female role in a VE. The results also showed that identification was not significantly correlated with <b>distance</b> <b>management</b> although identification and social presence were highly significantly correlated.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine the {{relationship}} between teachers’ perceived psychological distance and structural <b>distance</b> from <b>management</b> and teachers’ affective organisational commitment (AOC) and organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB). Teachers’ trust in management was expected to mediate these relationships.

At 10 Dutch schools for vocational education and training, 884 teachers completed a questionnaire. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Teachers’ psychological distance had a negative effect on trust in management (supervisor and higher management) and AOC. Trust in management had a positive effect on AOC, and trust in the supervisor had a positive effect on OCB. Structural distance did not influence teacher outcomes.

The production of plant dependent on various parameters of the plant like shoot length, number of leaves, root length, root numbers etc. Some other factors like soil, crop and <b>distance</b> <b>management</b> are also taken care of to produce maximum amount of yield. It is not desirable to use the no of leaves of the tree to calculate the growth of the plant because when the plant is growing some leaves may be lost and some new leaves may appear. It is also very difficult to measure the number of roots and length of growth of root in several time instances as it grows underground. So, it is very convenient to measure the plant growth on the basis of shoot length. In this paper, an effort has been made to predict the shoot length of mustard plant by Tabu Search (TS). The average error has been calculated based on the actual shoot and predicted shoot length. A comparitive study has been made among the different methods applied on same data set and one method has been selected based on minimum average error. The shoot length at maturity has been predicted by applying least square method on predicted data set with minimum average error. Finally, pod yield at maturity has been predicted by shoot length at maturity...|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates seafarers’ {{experiences}} of ill-treatment onboard ships. A sociological approach to ill-treatment is adopted, {{with a focus}} on characteristics of the work environment onboard which affect seafarers’ {{experiences of}} and responses to ill-treatment. A qualitative approach was employed to understand seafarers’ perceptions of ill-treatment. Semi-structured interviews based on the Negative Acts Questionnaire were conducted with seafarers and managerial personnel from one multinational and one Indian company. The seafarers were drawn from all ranks. Thematic analysis of the data revealed that seafarers’ perceptions, experiences and responses to ill-treatment were heavily influenced by characteristics of the work environment, including industry and company norms such as short-term contracts, the hierarchy, onboard, <b>distance</b> <b>management</b> and HR policies and training. Seafarers encountering ill-treatment can choose to exit their situation, raise their voice or remain silent. The findings showed that while support structures such as grievance procedures and union membership existed for seafarers experiencing ill-treatment, the majority of seafarers chose to remain silent because of complex interactions between a variety of workplace features. Fears included job insecurity, concern for career advancement, fear of blacklisting and personal financial concerns. Those seafarers that did choose to escape their situations found that there could be repercussions on their finances and their career ambitions, or that exercising their voice resulted in a reshuffle of seafarers but nothing of import changed. The professional socialisation process and culture onboard the ship are very important in influencing seafarers’ perceptions of ill-treatment, and {{play a role in the}} occurrence of preventative behaviour and use of coping mechanisms. In addition, the industry norms of short-term contracts, the purported manning crisis and a race to the bottom mentality force seafarers to be highly insecure in their jobs and encourage them to accept their situation until they can escape it...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 The recent {{development}} experience of modern economies demonstrates the increasing role and impacts of financial activities on {{regional and national}} economic systems, effects which remain largely overlooked by current theory and empirical work. This dissertation contributes to this gap in knowledge by addressing the geographical flow of capital into commercial real estate markets. Three main research questions are addressed: (1) does capital flow freely over space into commercial real estate markets in accordance with neo-classical expectations of market equilibrium or is the flow spatially uneven? (2) how and why have spatial patterns of capital flows changed over time, and (3) {{what are the implications}} of these changing spatial on local commercial real estate markets and regional economies? To answer these questions, the dissertation develops a theoretical framework to describe the decisions made by investors in their allocation of funds to particular places. This framework begins with a neo-classical process driven by spatial differences in rates of return on assets. Then, additional components are added which modify this simple process, including barriers and costs of <b>distance,</b> <b>management</b> of risk and uncertainty, organizational characteristics, industry specific factors and norms, path dependence, serendipity, and shocks and long-term structural change. Spatial outcomes are then tested empirically through analysis of investment behaviors by institutional, real estate investment trusts (REITs), and foreign investors in the US over the 1980 to 1996 period. This evidence shows a high degree of spatial differentiation amongst these players in their investment and also demonstrates a dispersal of capital to smaller metropolitan areas. In addition, there is a convergence of capitalization rates across regions. Empirical work in Stockholm Sweden illustrates the dramatic effects of a regulatory barrier on local property markets and the regional and national financial system in addition to the channeled flow of investment, particularly to central London, when these barriers were suddenly removed. The dissertation concludes that structural change and shocks have led to the dispersal of capital across places, yet there is no end to geography, as changes in individual and organizational behavior and increasing financial complexity will never allow a state of spatial equilibrium...|$|E
40|$|The {{fabric of}} the {{workforce}} is changing. Indeed, domestic managers are working with an increasingly multicultural workforce at home while managers who travel abroad often work with people from multiple cultures. Concurrently, managers are often required {{to work with people}} in organizations that span across geographic boundaries, located in various time zones, relying mainly on information technology. However, empirical guidelines to train managers facing these challenges are scant as management typologies fall short when it comes to identifying the skills needed for simultaneously working with people from multiple cultural backgrounds. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify a repertoire of multicultural managerial competencies for work at home and abroad, in face-to-face contexts and via the use of technology. Using competency modeling as a conceptual framework, we enlisted the help of 20 mid- to upper-level managers who were invited to participate in individual behavioral event interviews to discuss positive and negative critical incidents and to answer questions grounded in job analysis. Data was analyzed using thematic (content) analysis based on a mixed method, a process that mostly illustrated the emergence of new competencies. ATLAS. ti was then used to code transcripts and to cross-reference behaviors according to emerging competency categories. Managers were then invited to validate the relevance of the initial version of the typology and to confirm that no competencies or related behaviors were missing. The resulting Multicultural Managerial Competency (MMC) typology, outlining five competence categories that combine 12 competencies along with their 71 corresponding behavioral indicators, makes both theoretical and practical contributions while offering flexibility for application. Indeed, the MMC typology illustrates an overlap between management and intercultural/cross-cultural literature, confirming that managers in multicultural contexts are called upon to invest in the management of trusting relationships, in <b>distance</b> <b>management,</b> as well as in expatriate management. Multicultural elements also permeate classic business and team functions thereby giving management requirements a new form. In terms of practical applications, the MMC typology provides concrete behavioral indicators for managers to use as guidelines for competence and serves to inform the creation of university curricula in international management...|$|E
