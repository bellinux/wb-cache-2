50|$|The correct {{operation}} of an SIS requires {{a series of}} equipment to function properly. It must have sensors capable of detecting abnormal operating conditions, such as high flow, low level, or incorrect valve positioning. A logic solver is required to receive the sensor input signal(s), make appropriate decisions based {{on the nature of}} the signal(s), and change its outputs according to user-defined logic. The logic solver may use electrical, electronic or programmable electronic equipment, such as relays, trip amplifiers, or programmable logic controllers. Next, the change of the logic solver output(s) results in the final element(s) taking action on the process (e.g. closing a valve) to bring it to a safe state.

5000|$|The {{handling}} of compressed asphyxiant gases and {{the determination of}} appropriate environment for their use is regulated in the United States by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has an advisory role. OSHA requires employers who send workers into areas where the oxygen concentration is known or expected {{to be less than}} 19.5% to follow the provision of the Respiratory Protection Standard CFR 1910.134. Generally, work in an oxygen depleted environment requires an SCBA or airline respirator. The regulation also requires an evaluation of the worker's ability to perform the work while wearing a respirator, the regular training of personnel, respirator fit testing, periodic workplace monitoring, and regular respirator maintenance, inspection, and cleaning." [...] Containers should be labeled according to OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard CFR 1910.1200. These regulations were developed in accordance with the official recommendations of the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) pamphlet P-1. The specific guidelines for prevention of asphyxiation due to displacement of oxygen by asphyxiant gases is covered under CGA's pamphlet SB-2, Oxygen-Deficient Atmospheres.

40|$|The ODH {{problem in}} this case {{involves}} the <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> line to the clean room. which is isolated by a check valve from the gaseous nitrogen trailer backup source (valve CV 787 I, see DRG. NO. 3740. 510 -MA- 273995, attached (the 'to purging enclosure' line nms to the clean room)). Normally, the check valve prevents backflow through the <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> line. But as we all know, valves can fail. The estimated mean failure rate for a check valve to allow reverse flow is 3 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 7 }. Failure of the <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> and the check valve would allow the seepage ofgaseous nitrogen into the clean room. The failure of the <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> is necessary to cause an ODH problem, {{due to the fact}} that the air pressure would keep the lower pressured gaseous nitrogen from flowing through the check valve. The compressor for the <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> is fairly reliable, but to show the true nature of how safe this situation is, both cases that follow will assume that the compressor, and therefore the <b>instrument</b> <b>air,</b> has already failed. Table A shows the standard ODH situation. Assuming everything is working correctly (all the gasses are flowing, the ventilation is active, etc.), the only consideration is the failure of the check valve concurrent with the <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> failure. The table clearly shows an ODH classification of 0, which would hold even for an extreme leakage, and which does not even consider the likelihood of the <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> failure. which would lower the fatality rate even more. Note that the leak rate given in the tables following (50 scfm) is an overly generous amount considering the restricting nature of the small pipes and valve orifices. and that it is half of the compressor capacity. Table B is the same situation in the event of a power failure, estimated for eight times a year (1 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 3 } fails/hour), which would deactivate any electrically powered building devices, such as fans and air compressors. This scenario assumes that the <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> fails, the ventilation exhaust shuts down, and the check valve fails at the same time. The probability for this occurrence coinciding with the power failure is a multiple of the two failure rates. i. e. 3 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 7 } x 1 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 3 } = 3 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 10 }. Note that the ventilation failure would require that the minimum exhaust from the clean room to be identical to the leak resulting from the check valve failure, as an approximation of the leakage 'forcing' an exhaust rate. Again, the table shows that the ODH classification is well within the 0 range. None of these analyses suggest that this check valve poses a safety hazard in any manner, so no ODH equipment need be implemented...|$|E

The trailer is located south of DAB alongside the LN{sub 2 } Dewar. Fixed piping ties to the trailer with a flex-hose. The piping follows the cryo piping bridge entering the south wall of DAB. where it passes through the pipe chase and into the cryo pump room (Rm 315).

40|$|The DO {{experimental}} area has a generator designated as emergency power. This generator provides power for critical loads and starts automatically upon loss of commercial power. This note concerns {{the testing of}} this generator. A list of loads is attached to this note. One of the loads on the emergency power grid is a 10 KVA Uninterruptable Power Supply(UPS). The UPS powers the cryogenic controls and Oxygen deficiency hazard equipment(ODH) and has a minimum rating of 20 minutes while on its batteries(to cover the transfer time to/from the emergency generator). Jan 23, 1991 at 1640 hrs this system was tested {{under the supervision of}} the Terry Ross, Marv Johnson, Dan Markley, Kelly Dixon, and John Urbin. The power feeder to the emergency power grid at DO was disconnected. The generator responded immediately and was supplying power to the emergency power grid in less than 10 seconds. During the 10 seconds that there was no power on the emergency grid the UPS switched on its inverter and provided uninterrupted power to the cryogenic control system and the ODH system. All of the motorized equipment shut off <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> compressor, vacuum pumps 1 and 2, insulating vacuum blower, glycol cooling pumps, cooling tower fan, and Exhaust Fan 7 (EF 7). Upon reengagement of power to the grid from the emergency generator, all of the motorized loads started back up with the exception of vacuum pumps 1 and 2, and the UPS inverter turned off. Vacuum pumps 1 and 2 were delay started 20 seconds by the cryogenic control system as not to cause too large of a surge in power by all of the inductive loads starting at once. The DO building elevator which is also on emergency power was test run while the emergency generator was on line with all other emergency loads. The emergency generator current was 140 amps with all loads on line and running except the building elevator. This load of 140 amps is 27 % of the generator's capacity. The cryogenic control and ODH system continued to function properly throughout the entire test due to the UPS responding correctly to each power situation. The cryogenic control system isolated both the Utility(UV) and insulating(IV) vacuum systems as to preserve their vacua while the pumps were off. Once the vacuum pumps were reestablished the IV and UV vacua were put back on line to their respective pumps by the cryogenic control system. The <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> is backed up by a high pressure trailer, regulated down to <b>instrument</b> <b>air</b> pressure and switches automatically on line through a check valve.
