50|$|Hemodialysis is {{a method}} for {{removing}} waste products such as creatinine and urea, as well as free water from the blood when the kidneys are in kidney failure. The mechanical device used to clean the patients blood is called a <b>dialyser,</b> also known as an artificial kidney. The other name for artificial kidney is also called a dialysis machine. Modern dialysers typically consist of a cylindrical rigid casing enclosing hollow fibers cast or extruded from a polymer or copolymer, which is usually a proprietary formulation. The combined area of the hollow fibers is typically between 1-2 square meters. Intensive {{research has been conducted}} by many groups to optimize blood and dialysate flows within the <b>dialyser,</b> in order to achieve efficient transfer of wastes from blood to dialysate.|$|E

40|$|An {{in vitro}} set-up has been {{designed}} to study the hydraulic permeability of hollow fiber <b>dialysers.</b> Forward and reverse dialysate ultrafiltration were determined using both sterile <b>dialysers</b> and samples with a protein layer settled on the membrane (Fresenius F 6, F 8, F 60 and F 80). The ultrafiltration coefficient K-UF (ml/h. mmHg) was calculated as the ratio of volumetrical flow (Q(UF)) and transmembrane pressure (TMP) measurements. The protein layer on the membrane was induced either by recirculating human plasma through the <b>dialysers</b> (in vitro) or by a standard hemodialysis session (in vivo). K-UF is largely independent of TMP up to 600 mmHg (low flux) and 60 mmHg (high flux) for forward and reverse flow. In sterile <b>dialysers,</b> backfiltration yields a significantly different K-UF except for the F 80. An in vitro induced protein layer on the membrane decreases K-UF 15 - 30 % (forward) and 4 - 12 % (backward) in low flux and 45 - 70 % (forward) and 65 - 73 % (backward) in high flux <b>dialysers...</b>|$|R
50|$|MARS is an extracorporeal {{hemodialysis}} system {{composed of}} three different circuits: blood, albumin and low-flux dialysis. The blood circuit uses a double lumen catheter and a conventional hemodialysis device to pump the patient’s blood into the MARS FLUX, a biocompatible polysulfone high-flux <b>dialyser.</b> With a membrane surface area of 2.1 m2, 100 nm of thickness and a cut-off of 50 KDa, the MARSFLUX is essential to retaining the albumin in the dialysate. Blood is dialysed against a human serum albumin (HSA) dialysate solution that allows blood detoxification of both water-soluble and protein-bound toxins, {{by means of the}} presence of albumin in the dialysate (albumin dialysis). The albumin dialysate is then regenerated in a close loop in the MARS circuit by passing through the fibres of the low-flux diaFLUX filter, to clear water-soluble toxins and provide electrolyte/acid-base balance, by a standard dialysis fluid. Next, the albumin dialysate passes through two different adsorption columns; protein-bound substances are removed by the diaMARS AC250, containing activated charcoal and anionic substances are removed by the diaMARS IE250, filled with cholestyramine, an anion-exchange resin. The albumin solution is then ready to initiate another detoxifying cycle of the patient's blood that can be sustained until both adsorption columns are saturated, eliminating the need to continuously infuse albumin into the system during treatment (Fig. 1).|$|E

40|$|Continuous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) is {{the main}} form of renal {{replacement}} therapy in critically ill patients with severe acute kidney injury. Clotting of the <b>dialysers</b> during CVVHDF is frequent, because most patients with acute kidney injury have {{an increased risk of}} bleeding and cannot be systemically anticoagulated. Using data from a randomised controlled trial comparing the efficiency of CVVHDF by placing the dialysis catheter tip at the right atrium or superior vena cava, this study assessed the patient factors associated with an increased risk of frequent clotting of the dialysers—defined by > 1 <b>dialysers</b> clotted per day of CVVHDF. Of the 94 patients included in this study, a higher body mass index, a higher platelet count and a lower International Normalized Ratio were associated with an increased risk of frequent clotting of <b>dialysers</b> in the univariate analyses. Use of aspirin or clopidogrel, causes of acute kidney injury and daily dose of unfractionated heparin used were not significantly associated with the risk of frequent clotting of <b>dialysers.</b> In the multivariate parsimony model, only a high body mass index (odds ratio 1. 06 per point increment, 95 % confidence interval 1. 01 to 1. 13; P= 0. 036) and a high platelet count (odds ratio 1. 84 per 100 x 109 /l increment, 95 % confidence interval 1. 17 to 2. 91; P= 0. 009), both in a relatively linear fashion, were independently associated with an increased risk of frequent clotting of <b>dialysers.</b> Optimising the position of the tip of the dialysis catheter may be particularly important for patients with a high body mass index and platelet count in order to reduce frequent clotting of <b>dialysers</b> during CVVHDF...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Plasma /? 2 -M was {{measured}} by radio-immunoassay in samples obtained before and after dialysis with seven different <b>dialysers,</b> tested according to the protocol of the International Cooperative Biocompatibility Study (ICBS). Plasma /J 2 -M was cor-rected for contraction of its distribution volume, which {{was assumed to be}} equal to the extracellular fluid volume. The uncorrected plasma /? 2 -M concentration increased with all conventional <b>dialysers,</b> including the G 10 - 3 N, (cuprammonium cellulose plate), G 120 M (cuprammonium cellulose hollow fibre), CD 4000 (cel-lulose acetate) and T 150 (polymethylmethacrylate). However, {{no significant differences were found}} between the predialysis and the corrected postdialysis plasma /? 2 -M concentrations with these conventional <b>dialysers,</b> and thus no evidence of net generation or release of P 2 -M was found in this study. With high-permeability membranes, the corrected postdialysis /? 2 -M values were decreased by 27. 1 % with the Duo-Flux® Artificial Kidney, 53. 5 % with F 60, and 34. 6 % with Filtral, indicating that <b>dialysers</b> with these membranes eliminate plasma /? 2 -M to a certain extent. The complex of granulocyte elastase with arantipro-teinase in plasma was also measured in samples from the arterial blood line collected before, and after 30 and 120 min of dialysis with each of the seven <b>dialysers</b> in this study. All <b>dialysers</b> elicited an increase in the mean plasma elastase concentrations which was more than twice as high with cuprammonium cellulose plate than with all of the others.

40|$|Reuse of dialysers {{has been}} an {{integral}} part of hemodialysis since its inception. Over the past decade, reuse has increased significantly in many countries, most notably in the United States, while vanishing entirely in some other countries, such as Portugal and France. In the United States, which is most widely used as an example because of the large amount of data available, the mortality of dialysis patients has steadily decreased even as reuse has increased. This improvement is probably the result of a complex of factors including understanding the role of comorbidity, treatment unit characteristics, barriers to adequate dialysis, nutrition, anemia, high flux dialysis and <b>dialyser</b> membrane improvements and the desired dialysis dose. Reuse provides a significant economic benefit that allows the use of more efficient and expensive larger biocompatible synthetic membranes to provide high-quality dialysis in the face of cost inflation, limited medical resources and fixed reimbursement. Rather than being legitimized by clinical practice alone, reprocessing, supported by clinical studies, allows the provision of superior treatment to more patients safely and economically.

40|$|Background. In {{patients}} with primary hyperoxaluria (PH) and oliguric end-stage renal disease, oxalate removal is largely {{dependent on the}} clearance by dial-ysis. Data on the oxalate clearance of newer <b>dialyser</b> types are scarce or absent. Therefore, we measured oxalate clearances of seven dialysers in a single 52 -year-old female patient with PH. Since haemodiafiltration (HDF) has been advocated to increase oxalate clearance, we also assessed the effect of different pre-dilution flows. The goal {{of the study was}} to select the <b>dialyser</b> and pre-dilution flow combination with the highest oxalate clearance. Methods. Oxalate clearances were assessed by simul-taneously taking afferent blood and efferent dialysate samples at 30, 60, 120 and 180 min after the start of haemodialysis. Blood flow and dialysate flow were 350 and 500 ml/min, respectively. All dialysers were tested at a pre-dilution flow of 2 l/h. Six dialysers were also tested at either a pre-dilution flow of 4. 5 l/h or without HDF, depending on the ultrafiltration coefficient of the <b>dialyser.</b> Results. Oxalate clearances differed markedly between the tested dialysers, ranging from 144 ± 10 to 220 ± 12 ml/min.

40|$|Introduction: In post-dilution online haemodiafiltration (OL-HDF), {{the only}} {{recommendation}} concerning the dialysate, or dialysis fluid, refers to its purity. No study has yet determined whether using a high dialysate flow (Qd) {{is useful for}} increasing Kt or ultrafiltration-infusion volume. Objective: Study the influence of Qd on Kt and on infusion volume in OL-HDF. Material and methods: This was a prospective crossover study. There were 37 patients to whom 6 sessions of OL-HDF were administered at 3 different Qds: 500, 600 and 700  mL/min. A 5008 ® monitor {{was used for the}} dialysis in 21 patients, while an AK- 200 ® was used in 17. The <b>dialysers</b> used were: 20 with FX 800 ® and 17 with Polyflux- 210 ®. The rest of the parameters were kept constant. Monitor data collected were effective blood flow, effective dialysis time, final Kt and infused volume. Results: We found that using a Qd of 600 or 700  mL/min increased Kt by 1. 7 % compared to using a Qd of 500  mL/min. Differences in infusion volume were not significant. Increasing Qd from 500  mL/min to 600 and 700  mL/min increased dialysate consumption by 20 % and 40 %, respectively. Conclusions: With the monitors and <b>dialysers</b> currently used in OL-HDF, a Qd higher than 500  mL/min is unhelpful for increasing the efficacy of Kt or infusion volume. Consequently, using a high Qd wastes water, a truly important resource both from the ecological and economic points of view...|$|R

Leukocyte count, complement activation (C 3 a des arg), oxygen radical production and chemotaxis were measured at time zero and 15 min at the arterial and venous sites of the <b>dialyser.</b> Leukopenia observed at both sites was prevented only with PLP treatment.

40|$|AIM: Efficiency in {{removing}} middle molecules such as beta 2 -microglobulin (beta 2 -MG) {{is one of}} the main purposes of modern dialytic therapy. In order to achieve this, techniques requiring complex machines and substitution fluid have been developed over recent years. Alternatively, the internal filtration/back filtration phenomenon can be used. The recent development of a so-called "internal filtration enhanced dialyser" prompted us to compare the removal of beta 2 -MG together with other small molecules when the <b>dialyser</b> was used either in standard hemodiafiltration (HDF) or internal hemodiafiltration (iHDF). METHODS: Ten stable, anuric, hemodialysis (HD) patients treated by thrice weekly standard bicarbonate HD using low-flux synthetic membrane entered the study. A new high-flux polysulfone <b>dialyser</b> designed with the specific aim of enhancing internal filtration (BS- 1. 6 UL, 1. 6 m 2, Toray Industries) was used. Post dilution HDF (2. 5 l/hour of substitution fluid, dialysate flow 500 ml/min) was compared with iHDF (dialysate flow 750 ml/min), with blood flow at 300 ml/min. Samples were obtained at the start and at the end of the session in order to measure the % removal of urea, creatinine, uric acid, phosphate and beta 2 -MG (corrected for total protein concentration). In addition, after 20 min of dialysis the clearances of the same molecules were measured. A mathematical model has been developed for the description of the hydrodynamic phenomena taking place within the <b>dialyser</b> and of fluid filtration across the membrane. RESULTS: No significant differences have been observed in removal rate switching from HDF to iHDF except for beta 2 -MG removal, which was slightly higher in HDF than in iHDF Phosphate clearance is significantly higher than those obtained with creatinine in both HDF (p< 0. 005) and iHDF (p< 0. 01) modalities. The total convection calculated with the model is reduced with respect to HDF only by 24 % (4100 ml/h vs. 5400 ml/h on the average). CONCLUSIONS: iHDF is a high flux dialysis method, which, if performed with a <b>dialyser</b> designed to enhance internal filtration, obtains a much higher removal rate in comparison with dialysers in traditional high flux dialysis, as previously reported in the literature. Provided that the <b>dialyser</b> is used on a dialysis machine working with ultra pure dialysate and UF control, this <b>dialyser</b> line can perform reliable internal HDF without the need for replacement solution. Considering the narrow difference in performance observed between iHDF and HDF, and the increasing number (and age) of patients leading to higher dialysis costs, iHDF represents a cost-effective alternative to other diffusive-convective techniques...|$|E
40|$|A {{clinical}} {{evaluation of the}} new dialysers. Seventeen hemodialysers, studied by one team using the same techniques throughout, are compared {{in terms of their}} clearance of urea and creatinine, priming volume, residual blood volume, ultrafiltration rate, handling and cost. Data on clearance of higher molecular weight substances are also presented for six of the dialysers. The Meltec 1 m 2 Multipoint <b>dialyser</b> has a considerable superiority over the Kiil of the same surface area in clearance of all molecules studied, a higher ultrafiltration rate and similar priming volume, residual blood volume, handling characteristics and cost. Of the disposable dialysers the EX- 03, Nephravon, Ultraflo 100 and Ultraflo 2 coils and the Dasco SP 400, Gambro Lundia and Rhone Poulenc 1 D parallel flow dialysers all have urea and creatinine clearances superior to the Kiil. There are small differences in performance between members of this group but they are counterbalanced by differences in priming volume, flexibility of ultrafiltration, ease of handling, leakage rate and cost. Thus there is no single disposable <b>dialyser</b> which has a clearcut superiority over its rivals. The Cordis HFAK has a considerably higher urea and creatinine clearance than any other disposable <b>dialyser</b> but its clearance of large molecules is lower and its residual blood volume higher when compared to the Kiil...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionIn post-dilution online haemodiafiltration (OL-HDF), {{the only}} {{recommendation}} concerning the dialysate, or dialysis fluid, refers to its purity. No study has yet determined whether using a high dialysate flow (Qd) {{is useful for}} increasing Kt or ultrafiltration-infusion volume. ObjectiveStudy the influence of Qd on Kt and on infusion volume in OL-HDF. Material and methodsThis was a prospective crossover study. There were 37 patients to whom 6 sessions of OL-HDF were administered at 3 different Qds: 500, 600 and 700 mL/min. A 5008 ® monitor {{was used for the}} dialysis in 21 patients, while an AK- 200 ® was used in 17. The <b>dialysers</b> used were: 20 with FX 800 ® and 17 with Polyflux- 210 ®. The rest of the parameters were kept constant. Monitor data collected were effective blood flow, effective dialysis time, final Kt and infused volume. ResultsWe found that using a Qd of 600 or 700 mL/min increased Kt by 1. 7 % compared to using a Qd of 500 mL/min. Differences in infusion volume were not significant. Increasing Qd from 500 mL/min to 600 and 700 mL/min increased dialysate consumption by 20 % and 40 %, respectively. ConclusionsWith the monitors and <b>dialysers</b> currently used in OL-HDF, a Qd higher than 500 mL/min is unhelpful for increasing the efficacy of Kt or infusion volume. Consequently, using a high Qd wastes water, a truly important resource both from the ecological and economic points of view...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the uremic state {{of patients with}} end-stage renal disease is highly pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant. Moreover, the contact with the dialyzer’s membrane activates the leucocytes and further increases the inflammation and oxidative stress. Therefore, numerous approaches have been proposed for reduction of oxidative stress in hemodialysed patients, from antioxidant therapy through diet rich in natural antioxidants to the improvement of <b>dialyser’s</b> membrane. The changes in the oxidative status of hemodialysed patients, which resulted from above mentioned interventions, were assessed by different methods, some of them similar to those included in our study. Our comparative study provides a new insight {{to the past and}} future studies of oxidative stress research, especially in chronically hemodialysed patients. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{haemodialysis}} on mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte DNA synthesis was determined in twenty-four uraemic patients. Lymphocytes pre-haemodialysis {{were significantly less}} responsive to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) than were control lymphocytes and showed {{the same degree of}} impairment as uraemic lymphocytes. Intrinsic lymphocyte responsiveness improved immediately after each haemodialysis. Pre-haemodialysis plasma inhibited control lymphocyte responsiveness and this inhibition was even greater in post-haemodialysis plasma. This effect of haemodialysis on plasma lasted for 4 [...] 8 hr. Similar alterations of response were noted, despite the use of different <b>dialysers</b> and also when two other mitogens were substituted for PHA. This deleterious effect of haemodialysis on lymphocyte function is important for its possible immune consequences, and may indicate a deficiency in current haemodialysis technique...|$|R
