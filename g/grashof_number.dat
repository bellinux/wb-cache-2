It appears that for air (Pr= 0. 7) the flow exhibits a two-vortex solution for all <b>Grashof</b> <b>numbers</b> and axial positions investigated, whereas for water (Pr= 5. 0), secondary flow evolves from a two-vortex solution, via a four-voltex solution toward a six-voltex solution for increasing <b>Grashof</b> <b>numbers</b> and axial distances.

30|$|In {{this study}} a steady state {{two-dimensional}} mixed convection problem {{in an air}} filled cavity is investigated. The effects of linearly heated and uniformly cooled walls on flow and heat transfer characteristics within the cavity are determined. The strength of the fluid circulation within the cavity is found for both heated and cooled walls for different Reynolds and <b>Grashof</b> <b>numbers.</b> The nonlinear coupled equations are solved numerically using the penalty-Galerkin finite element method. Stream function and isotherm results are obtained for different Reynolds and <b>Grashof</b> <b>numbers.</b> The results for the heat transfer rate are presented {{in terms of both}} the local and the average Nusselt number. In general, the strength of the circulation is stronger for the case of cooled walls, and the anti-clockwise circulation is significantly stronger for cooled walls, while the clockwise circulation is only slightly stronger for the cooled walls and the difference in strength decreases both with increasing Reynolds and <b>Grashof</b> <b>numbers.</b> Both the local and average Nusselt numbers are generally higher for the case of cooled side walls than that for heated side walls.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{development}} of mixed convection in a helically coiled heat exchanger for Re = 500, Pr = 5 and d = 1 / 14 is studied. The influence of buoyancy forces (Gr = ¢O (105)) on heat transfer and secondary flow is analyzed. In the method used the parabolized equations are solved using a finite difference discretization. The code is tested on mixed convection flow in a 90 ° curved tube of which the results are compared to the results obtained with an elliptical code. For the helically coiled tube a constant wall temperature is considered. It appeared that heat transfer is highly influenced by secondary flow induced by centrifugal and buoyancy forces. For low <b>Grashof</b> <b>numbers</b> a splitting phenomenon of the temperature field is observed due to large secondary velocities, resulting in two separated areas of fluid. For high <b>Grashof</b> <b>numbers</b> the fluid in the coiled pipe becomes almost linearly startified which results in small secondary velocities.

40|$|Mixed {{convective}} flow and heat transfer characteristics for two-dimensional laminar flow in a channel with different geometries of a backward-facing step are presented for various <b>Grashof</b> <b>numbers.</b> The wall downstream of the step was maintained {{at a constant}} temperature; TH, while the upper wall was considered isothermal at TC. The wall upstream of the step and the backward-facing step were considered as adiabatic surfaces. Navier-Stokes equations were employed to represent the transport phenomena in the channel. Further, the governing equations were solved using a finite element formulation based on the Galerkin method of weighted residuals. The numerical results of the reattachement lengths for recirculation region in a vertical channel with a backward-facing step (Re = 100) were validated by comparing them against documented studies in the literature. The results of this investigation show that the local skin friction coefficient increases {{with an increase in}} <b>Grashof</b> <b>numbers.</b> The results of this investigation show that configuration II of the backward-facing step (inclined) exhibited an absence of vortices for all values of <b>Grashof</b> <b>numbers</b> and consequently the minimum skin friction coefficient.

A survey of literature is presented which brings out the fact, that the phenomenon although it has been investigated to a large extent, still gives rise to widespread dispute and uncertainties which need careful examination. An analytical approach is presented showing that the hydrodynamic boundary layer is equal to the thermal boundary layer. In the past it was simply assumed to be so, in order to limit the computations, and the assumption was justified by the excellent agreement between calculations and experimental data. An analysis is presented showing the analogy existing between the <b>Grashof</b> and Reynolds <b>numbers,</b> as it is expected in the case of low velocities and considerable temperature differences, i. e. in free convection.
