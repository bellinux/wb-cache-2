25|$|Pathan traders {{from modern}} Afghanistan and Pakistan arrived by boat in eastern Sri Lanka {{as early as}} the 15th century, via India. They landed in Batticaloa, which was a key port. Economic {{competition}} at the time led to frequent conflicts between Tamil fishing castes, particularly over control of resources. One nearby village known as Eravur, inhabited by Mukkuvars, was the target of multiple attacks and looting during harvesting seasons by Thimilar <b>folks</b> <b>from</b> Batticaloa. The Mukkuvars established an alliance with Batticaloa's Pathan warriors, enlisting their help to fend off the incursions and protect the village. The Thimilars were defeated and retreated northwards.|$|E
