The definitive version ias available at: [URL] paper describes a collaborative research project run as part of the UK based Textile & Clothing Industry Forum, that aimed to investigate new ways of understanding the end customer. In deciding to ‘speak’ to the end customer, the <b>fibre</b> <b>manufacturer</b> Tencel Limited made a radical move to break away from the traditional structure of the apparel supply chain. This paper describes how a combination of a Kano questionnaire and empathic design techniques developed for the automotive industry were effectively used to gather new insights into how customers really perceived Tencel’s fibre, and enable the product development team to ‘walk in the shoes’ of the people they design for. The paper concludes that applying these techniques to the textiles industry is a very effective way of obtaining rich and genuine opinions from the end customer and saw that the ‘raw’ video data generated proved to be a very successful way of communicating with senior management...|$|E
40|$|Steel fibre {{reinforced}} concrete (SFRC) is increasingly {{being used for}} ground slab applications. The addition of steel fibres to concrete imparts significant post-cracking ductility (toughness). This ductility is used to determine a post-cracking strength, which when combined with the pre-cracking strength forms the so-called 'design strength' for SFRC ground slabs. Consequently, the SFRC slab thickness can be reduced in comparison with plain concrete (brittle) slabs. The aim {{of this paper was}} to assess the effect of ductility on the load-carrying capacity of SFRC slabs and subsequently compare the deformation behaviour of the SFRC slab to an equivalent plain concrete slab. Based on the post-cracking strength specified by the steel <b>fibre</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> a SFRC ground slab was designed to collapse at the same load as the failure load of a plain concrete slab. The two slabs were then cast, cured for 28 days and afterwards loaded at their centre points till failure. Although the SFRC slab was designed to be 16, 6 % thinner, the measured failure load and deflection were found to be approximately equal for the two slabs. These test results indicate that the load-carrying capacity of concrete ground slabs can be increased by inclusion of nominal steel fibre contents. [URL] Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fibre</b> <b>manufacturers</b> specify {{different}} paramete rs {{for measuring}} {{the performance of their}} fibres, e. g. Re 3 number or σ - ε diagram. However, these parameters depend largely on the strength class of the concrete; most specifically on the fracture energy, which is in itself a variable from cement manufacturer to manufacturer, even within the same class. It follows therefore that any fibre performance param eters as specified by the manufacturer’s laboratory may vary significantly for the same concrete class in the user’s laboratory. The ideal would be to find a performance parameter that is fibre specific and at least partially independent of the concrete, which could then be used for characterizing and comparing the various fibre types. In this paper I present a fibre added energy {{that could be used to}} characterize the fibres in this way...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} national policies and institutions on the strategies that companies adopt when they are faced with disruptive changes in their external environment. The article focuses on the man-made fibres industry in the U. S., Western Europe and Japan between 1980 and 2010 and describes the {{different ways in which}} the leading fibre manufacturers in those regions responded to the shift in textile, clothing and later fibre production to low-cost countries, principally in Asia. These companies had to decide whether they could continue to compete profitably in the man-made fibres industry, and, if not, what non-fibre businesses they should invest in. In countries such as the U. S. and the UK, where capital markets are powerful and companies are under pressure to enhance shareholder value, virtually all the former leaders have withdrawn from the industry and a set of new entrants, including private equity firms, have taken their place. In Japan, by contrast, leading companies such as Toray and Teijin remain committed to man-made fibres, although they have also diversified in other directions. Despite the increasing role of Anglo-American investors in Japan, Japanese companies see themselves as responsible to a broad range of stakeholders, not just to shareholders; the continuity of the enterprise and of employment is given a higher priority than in the U. S. or the UK. In Continental Europe, the restructuring of the man-made fibres industry has involved numerous divestments and demergers, and this partly reflects the growing influence of Anglo-American investors, but in some of these countries the stakeholder view of the enterprise continues to carry considerable weight. Lenzing in Austria, which is now the largest European man-made <b>fibre</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> {{is an example of a}} company which has combined commercial success with a strong sense of responsibility to the region where its main factory is based. In reviewing these different strategies the article shows how Japanese-style “long-termism” can be a source of strength in certain industries such as carbon fibre, but has the disadvantage of allowing companies to persist for too long with low-return businesses which might do a better under different owners. Some further movement towards the Anglo-American model is likely in Japan and in Continental Europe, but these countries have a different view of what companies are for, and this will continue to affect how their companies respond to industrial change...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the current {{international}} standards and corresponding apparatus {{for measuring the}} thermal conductivity of refractory glass fibre products have been reviewed. Refractory glass fibres are normally produced {{in the form of}} low-density needled mats. A major issue with thermal conductivity measurements of these materials is lack of reproducibility in the test results due to transformation of the test material during the test. Also needled mats are inherently inhomogeneous, and this poses additional problems. To be able to compare the various methods of thermal conductivity measurement, a refractory reference material was designed which is capable of withstanding maximum test temperatures (1673 K) with minimum transformation. The thermal conductivity of this reference material was then measured using various methods according to the different standards surveyed. In order to compare different materials, samples have been acquired from major refractory glass <b>fibre</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and the results have been compared against the newly introduced reference material.

40|$|Glass fibre {{reinforcements}} {{form the}} foundation of a composite materials industry with a global annual production of greater than 10 million tons of high performance, light weight carbon footprint lowering materials. Possibly the most critical component involved in the manufacture of glass fibres and their composites is the fibre sizing. Yet because of the intense level of industrial secrecy around sizings there are very few people in the vast chain of composite materials suppliers, processers and end users who have more than a superficial understanding of what glass fibre sizings are and what they do. There are many questions which this large and growing composite community poses about glass fibre sizings. Which analytical techniques are most useful in sizing research? Who has published research results on sizing and their ingredients? Which silanes are the most researched for use in sizings? Which glass <b>fibre</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have reported research findings on sizings? This review will act as a guide to obtaining some of the answers to these and many other questions about glass fibre sizings. The composites materials industry is currently experiencing a period of intense growth in new application development due to the potential which light-weight high performance composite materials have to reduce the carbon footprint of many industries. Composite materials have been highly successful in such applications due to the synergy of combining two, or more, dissimilar materials to obtain a better performance than the sum of the individual components. Glass fibre has been particularly successful as the reinforcement in these composites. Today glass fibre products account for more than 95 % of fibre reinforcements used in the composites industry, primarily due to their highly attractive performance to price ratio. Possibly the most critical component involved in the manufacture of glass fibres and their composites is the fibre sizing. Sizing is a thin surface coating of mainly organic materials applied to nearly all types of man-made fibres during their manufacture. Given the well-recognized critical importance of sizing in all aspects of the profitability, processibility and performance of glass reinforced composites and consequently to the ultimate success of the composites industry, it is surprising (perhaps even astonishing) to note the lack of a proportionally sized body of fundamental and applied research publications on this subject. There can be few examples of such a large materials industry (global annual production well in excess of 10 million tons of fibre reinforced composites) where the manufacturing and performance of those materials are so critically dependent on such a small component that is so narrowly understood. The research and development of glass fibre sizing is inextricably linked to the intellectual property concerns of glass <b>fibre</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and consequently information {{on the nature of the}} technical challenges facing sizing developers is not openly available to the technical community. Despite these challenges there has been quite some work published in and around the subject of glass fibre sizings over the years. Given the importance of sizings to the continuing success and growth of the composites industry this review has collected and summarized a large proportion of the widely dispersed literature which is openly available around glass fibre sizings. The review should beneficial to academic researchers embarking on, or already working on, fundamental research in the area of glass fibre sizings and interfaces in glass reinforced composites. However, industrial readers from the composite materials supply chain and those engaged with end-use applications using glass reinforced polymers should also find the contents highly useful in improving their insight and understanding of this critical aspect of composite materials...|$|R

40|$|Colour {{forecasting}} is {{a sector}} of trend forecasting which {{is arguably the}} most important link in the product development process, yet little is known about it, the methodology behind its development or its accuracy. It is part of a global trend forecasting industry valued recently at 36 bn, providing information which is developed commercially eighteen months to two years ahead of the season. Used throughout the garment supply chain, by the yarn and <b>fibre</b> <b>manufacturers,</b> the fabric mills, garment designers and retailers, it plays a pivotal role in the fashion and textile industry, but appears in many different forms. Colour forecasts were first commercially produced in 1917, but became more widely used during the 1970 s, and in recent years digital versions of colour forecasts have become increasingly popular. The investigation aimed to establish the historical background of the industry, mindful of the considerable changes to fashion manufacturing and retailing in recent decades. For the purposes of the investigation, a period spanning 25 years was selected, from 1985 to 2010. In reviewing the available literature, and the methodologies currently used in developing forecasting information, it became clear that there was a view that the process is very intuitive, and thus a lack of in depth academic literature. This necessitated a considerable quantity of primary research in order to fill the gaps in the knowledge regarding the development, use and accuracy of colour forecasting. A mixed method approach to primary research was required to answer the aim of the thesis, namely to investigate how colour forecasts are compiled, and examine their use, influence and accuracy within the fashion and textiles industry, suggesting methods for developing more accurate forecasts in the future. Interviews were conducted with industry practitioners comprising forecasters, designers and retailers to better understand how colour was developed and used within industry. Two longitudinal studies were carried out with the two largest UK clothing retailers to map their development and use of colour palettes, and understand better how colour contributes to the critical path and supply chain. Two colour development meetings were observed, one with a commercial colour forecaster, the other with an industry association, and two colour archives were studied to establish whether or not any identifiable and predictable colour cycles existed. Data from the interviews and longitudinal studies were analysed using a grounded approach, and revealed some new insights into the influences upon the development of colour forecasts both commercially and from the retailer's perspective. The sell through rates of merchandise, EPOS analysis and range of practices between those interviewed and the two retailers studied provided an interesting insight into working practices and how colour forecasting information is changed when used by the retailers. It was found that a group of core colours existed, which were used season after season, and consistently demonstrated a high sell through rate, such as black, white, grey and navy. In order to establish whether or not colour cycles were consistently predictable in their repetition, two colour forecasting archives were assessed. If predictable colour cycles existed, they would be a useful tool in developing more accurate forecasts. Unfortunately this was not the case, as no clear colour cycles were found. However, the archive, together with evidence from the retailers demonstrated the 'lifecycle' of fashion colours was longer than expected, as they took time to phase in and out. It was concluded that in general the less fashion led brands used their own signature colours and were able to develop colour palettes far later in the product development timeline. This approach could be adopted more widely by retailers and designers as it was discovered that although accuracy rates for colour forecasts are generally accepted to be around 80...|$|R
40|$|Canada {{has been}} {{recognized}} as the largest exporter of flax seed in the world. Currently, very little flax straw is further processed, despite its potential as a value added product, with only about 7 - 10 % of Canadian flax seed producers harvesting residual flax straw rather than burning the straw. A traditional use of flax straw {{has been for the}} production of fibre for the linen industry. Interest in flax fibre has been rekindled with the impetus to seek out bioproducts that replace non-renewal resources and provide value-added opportunities for agricultural producers. Flax fibre also has a range of potential uses in automotive parts, geotextiles, insulation material, etc. Despite this potential, the Canadian flax fibre sector remains largely underdeveloped, with fledgling supply chains and lack of investment in the necessary processing capacity. This paper develops a framework for analysing the relational exchanges at different stage of the supply chain to determine if the paucity in investment is the result of prohibitively high exchange costs. A number of distinct stages in the flax fibre supply chain can be identified: farmers producing flax seed and/or straw; processors who extract the natural fibre from the straw; and manufacturers who use the fibre in their products. The paper develops a framework that draws together insights from Transaction Cost Economics, Agency Theory and Bargaining Theory. The role of institutions in facilitating quality measurement and providing participants with information is also considered. The theoretical framework identifies asset specificity, agency measurement costs, bargaining power and under-developed institutions as key factors {{in the development of the}} flax fibre sector. From the theoretical framework, a set of propositions is developed that examine the anticipated effect of these factors on vertical coordination in the sector. The theoretical propositions are explored through a series of semi-structured interviews with parties at each stage of the supply chain (producers, <b>fibre</b> processors, final <b>manufacturers),</b> as well as with industry experts. Information from the interviews is used to identify the transaction characteristics and the institutional framework characterizing the flax fibre sector in Canada. This is analysed through a comparative case study approach with the flax fibre sector in Europe, and the wool fibre sector in New Zealand as an example of a fully developed and long-standing fibre sector. By also noting the different vertical coordination strategies that are present in these supply chains, a connection is drawn between the presence of certain transaction characteristics and the corresponding cost-minimizing exchange relationships. The case studies are used to investigate the propositions developed from the theoretical framework regarding the impact of transaction characteristics on the optimal vertical coordination strategy and the impediments to development and investment in the sector. The propositions developed in the framework are verified to a great extent by the comparative case study. The uncertainty in the exchange environment regarding the future direction of the flax fibre industry and the high measurement costs due to the absent quality and grading regime in the Canadian flax fibre set the two industries apart from each other. Both of these dimensions impact the exchange costs of a transaction and subsequently, the extent to which the parties are closely coordinated. The case studies verify that using a framework to analyze transactions provides additional insights because of the joint consideration of several features of the transaction...|$|R
