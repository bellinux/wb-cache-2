5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Pterocles are mainly found in the drier parts of northern, eastern and {{southern}} Africa though the range of some species extends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> East and western Asia. The Madagascar sandgrouse is restricted to Madagascar. The black-bellied sandgrouse and the pin-tailed sandgrouse also occur in Spain, Portugal and southern France. Most species are sedentary though some make local migrations, typically to lower altitudes in winter.|$|E

5|$|Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) {{returns to}} his team in {{spectacular}} fashion, walking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a hostage situation involving his team and an alien Blowfish, shooting the intoxicated Blowfish in the head. At the Hub, his team question why he left them, and he simply responds {{that he had found}} his Doctor and that he belongs at Torchwood. The team is then alerted to a death near a multi-storey car park, where the team detect energy from the Rift on the corpse. Jack, to even his surprise, gets a hologram message on his vortex manipulator from a person he recognises, and leaves the team to talk to him.|$|E
5|$|Colder weather, {{bringing}} with it rain and snow on September 11 calmed the fires down substantially throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Though the fires continued to burn well <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of November, they never again posed an immediate risk to life or property. Many fire crews were sent home, but additional manpower continued {{to arrive at}} Yellowstone to rehabilitate areas that had {{been affected by the}} firefighting efforts. Hundreds of miles of firelines, helicopter landing zones and fire camps needed to be restored to a more natural state, and thousands of hazardous dead trees needed to be cut down to protect roads and buildings. Finally, on November 18, all fires in Yellowstone were officially declared out.|$|E

5|$|Final Fantasy Tactics (1997), a {{tactical}} role-playing game developed {{and published by}} Square for the Sony PlayStation video game console, marked the first appearance of Ivalice. The game combined thematic elements of the Final Fantasy video game series with a game engine and battle system unlike those previously seen in the franchise. Final Fantasy Tactics {{is set in a}} fictional medieval-inspired kingdom called Ivalice and created by Yasumi Matsuno. The game's story follows Ramza Beoulve, a highborn cadet who finds himself thrust <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of an intricate military conflict known as The Lion War, where two opposing noble factions are coveting the throne of the kingdom.

5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the debate about whether Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank exchange of views.|$|E
5|$|Many of the fortifications {{built by}} the Romans in England survived <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages, {{including}} the walls surrounding their military forts and cities. These defences were often reused during the unstable post-Roman period. The Anglo-Saxon kings undertook significant planned urban expansion in the 8th and 9th centuries, creating burhs, often protected with earth and wood ramparts. Burh walls sometimes utilised older Roman fortifications, both for practical reasons and to bolster their owners' reputations through the symbolism of former Roman power.|$|E

5|$|Plantations {{continued}} to develop along {{the fringes of}} present-day West Virginia. By {{the close of the}} 18th century, Harman Blennerhassett had constructed a mansion on his plantation on Blennerhassett Island and Moses Shepherd had built Shepherd Hall near Wheeling, both in the Ohio River valley. Despite the agricultural development of then western Virginia's bottomlands and the resulting wealth of the plantation owners, the hinterlands of the Allegheny Mountains and Allegheny Plateau regions remained underpopulated and inhabited by subsistence farmers of meager means <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 19th century. By the 1860 United States Census, Berkeley, Greenbrier, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Kanawha, and Monroe counties consequently had the largest populations of slaves in present-day West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{date that}} Burebista came to reign over the Dacians is debated among sources; University of Illinois {{professor}} Keith Hitchins give a starting date for Burebista's reign of 82 BC, while historian Matthew Bunson, and authors John Middleton and Michael Schmitz suggest a starting date around 61–60 BC. The historian John Koch states that Burebista founded an empire {{sometime during the}} 1st century BC and that around 61 BC Burebista expelled the Celts and moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> Danube.|$|E
5|$|The last {{stretch of}} Hebden Beck {{before it reaches}} the River Wharfe was used to power a corn mill in the Middle Ages, and corn milling survived <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 19th century. In the 14th century Fountains Abbey had a fulling mill in the village. In 1791 a three-storey cotton mill was built {{alongside}} the corn mill. It housed 54 spinning frames and was productive until 1870 when it was driven out of business by the more efficient stream-driven machinery of the industrial revolution. At its peak, the mill employed more than 70 men, women, and children. The building was used for other purposes including a roller skating rink until it was demolished in 1967.|$|E

5|$|The two losses, piled {{upon the}} loss to Georgia Tech, left Clemson with a 2–3 record. An {{anonymous}} report said coach Swinney became involved in a shouting match with a position coach, while players called a private meeting {{in an effort to}} turn the team's season around. On October 17, The Tigers rallied from their losing streak by defeating Wake Forest, 38–3, and moved back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the competition for the Atlantic Division championship. One week after defeating Wake Forest, the Tigers traveled to Miami, Florida, to play the Miami Hurricanes, who were ranked No. 10 in the Bowl Championship Series Poll. The Tigers played the Hurricanes into overtime, then upset Miami with a touchdown, 40–37.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Edward {{discovers that}} Amos is {{secretly}} a werewolf but shows no ill-will towards his employer. Amos, upon returning to normal, reveals {{the woman is}} Sandra, and she attends Auburn University. Edward confesses his love to Sandra, but she declines his wedding proposal despite numerous romantic gestures. He then learns she is already engaged to Don Price, a fellow Ashton citizen. Don beats Edward in a fight, prompting Sandra to break off their engagement and marry Edward. Shortly after, Edward is conscripted into the army and sent {{to fight in the}} Korean War. He parachutes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of a North Korean military show, steals important documents, and convinces Siamese twins Ping and Jing to help him go home in exchange for making them celebrities.|$|E
5|$|Tides cause {{seawater}} {{to enter}} {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns River and can affect the river's level <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.|$|E

As a result of the {{hypothermia}} and frostbite he suffers, his feet are amputated when he returns to the present. Henry and Clare both know that without the ability to escape when he time travels, Henry will certainly die within his next few jumps. On New Year's Eve 2006 Henry time travels <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the Michigan woods in 1984 and is accidentally shot by Clare's brother, a scene foreshadowed earlier in the novel. Henry returns to the present and dies in Clare's arms.|$|E
5|$|Although modern {{biology is}} a {{relatively}} recent development, sciences related to and included within it have been studied since ancient times. Natural philosophy was studied {{as early as the}} ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Indian subcontinent, and China. However, the origins of modern biology and its approach to the study of nature are most often traced back to ancient Greece. While the formal study of medicine dates back to Hippocrates (ca. 460 BC – ca. 370 BC), it was Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC) who contributed most extensively to the development of biology. Especially important are his History of Animals and other works where he showed naturalist leanings, and later more empirical works that focused on biological causation and the diversity of life. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany that survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to the plant sciences, even <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle, {{and nearly}} all Western {{scholars}} after him until the 18th century, believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to humans: the scala naturae or Great Chain of Being. Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany—the History of Plants—which survived {{as the most important}} contribution of antiquity to botany, even <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Ages. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as carpos for fruit, and pericarpion for seed vessel. Dioscorides wrote a pioneering and encyclopaedic pharmacopoeia, De Materia Medica, incorporating descriptions of some 600 plants and their uses in medicine. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History, assembled a similarly encyclopaedic account of things in nature, including accounts of many plants and animals.|$|E
