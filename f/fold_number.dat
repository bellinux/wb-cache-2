40|$|Abstract. Let G and H be two cographs. We {{show that}} the problem to {{determine}} whether H is a retract of G is NP-complete. We show that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized {{by the size of}} H. When restricted to the class of threshold graphs or to the class of trivially perfect graphs, the problem becomes tractable in polynomial time. The problem is also soluble in linear time when one cograph is given as an induced subgraph of the other. Foldings generalize retractions. We {{show that the}} problem to fold a trivially perfect graph onto a largest possible clique is NP-complete. For a threshold graph this <b>folding</b> <b>number</b> equals its chromatic number and achromatic number. We characterize the absolute retracts of cographs. ...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "double fold" [...] {{refers to}} the test used by many librarians and {{preservation}} administrators to determine the brittleness and [...] "usability" [...] of paper. The test consists of folding down {{the corner of a}} page of a book or newspaper, then folding it back in the opposite direction - one double fold. The action is then repeated until the paper breaks or is about to break. The test yields a <b>fold</b> <b>number.</b> (In the late 1960s, preservation founding father William Barrow was fond of using a machine-run fold tester to back up his claims about the number of endangered books.) This experiment was used by library officials to identify their institution's brittle books, and, in some case, to justify withdrawing items from the shelves or replacing them with another format (most often microfilm). Baker describes the double fold test as [...] "...utter horseshit and craziness. A leaf of a book is a semi-pliant mechanism. It was made for non-acute curves, not for origami." [...] (p. 157).|$|E
40|$|Various {{regions of}} {{amplification}} or loss are observed in breast tumors as {{a manifestation of}} genomic instability. To date, numerous oncogenes or tumor suppressors on some of these regions have been characterized. An increasing body of evidence suggests that such regions also harbor microRNA genes with crucial regulatory roles in cellular processes and disease mechanisms, including cancer. Here, we investigated 35 microRNAs localized to common genomic gain and/or loss regions in breast cancers. To examine amplification or loss of these microRNAs as a result of genomic instability, we performed semiquantitative duplex polymerase chain reaction in 20 breast cancer cell lines, 2 immortalized mammary cell lines, and 2 normal DNA controls. A comprehensive DNA <b>fold</b> <b>number</b> change data for 35 microRNA genes on chromosomal gain/loss regions are presented in breast cancer cells. A 23 % (8 / 35) of the investigated microRNAs showed significant <b>fold</b> <b>number</b> increases (greater than fourfold) compared to GAPDH in {{one or more of the}} breast cell lines. Although no homozygous deletions were detected, <b>fold</b> <b>number</b> decreases indicating potential loss regions were observed for 26 % (9 / 35) of the investigated microRNAs. Such <b>fold</b> <b>number</b> changes may point out some of these microRNAs as potential targets of the genomic instability regions as oncogene and tumor suppressor candidates. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the problem of}} covering an input graph H with graphs from a fixed covering class G. The classical covering number of H with respect to G is the minimum number of graphs from G needed to cover the edges of H without covering non-edges of H. We introduce a unifying notion of three covering parameters with respect to G, {{two of which are}} novel concepts only considered in special cases before: the local and the <b>folded</b> covering <b>number.</b> Each parameter measures " how far " H is from G in a different way. Whereas the <b>folded</b> covering <b>number</b> has been investigated thoroughly for some covering classes, e. g., interval graphs and planar graphs, the local covering number has received little attention. We provide new bounds on each covering number with respect to the following covering classes: linear forests, star forests, caterpillar forests, and interval graphs. The classical graph parameters that result this way are interval number, track number, linear arboricity, star arboricity, and caterpillar arboricity. As input graphs we consider graphs of bounded degeneracy, bounded degree, bounded tree-width or bounded simple tree-width, as well as outerplanar, planar bipartite, and planar graphs. For several pairs of an input class and a covering class we determine exactly the maximum ordinary, local, and <b>folded</b> covering <b>number</b> of an input graph with respect to that covering class...|$|R

Of interest is that the rotational Doppler shift directly reflects the rotational symmetry of q-plates and can be also expressed as Delta omega = Omega n, where n = 2 (q- 1) denotes the <b>fold</b> <b>number</b> of rotational symmetry.
