60|$|We shall find, {{as we go}} on, that {{he spent}} his money freely, as men did at Rome who had the command of large means. We are {{aware that he was}} often in debt. We find that from his letters. But he owed money not as a needy man does, but as one who is speculative, sanguine, and quite {{confident}} of his own resources. The management of incomes was not so fixed a thing then as it <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>now.</b> Speculation was even more rampant, and rising men were willing and were able to become indebted for enormous sums, having no security to offer but the promise of their future career. Cæsar's debts during various times of his life were proverbial. He is said to have owed over £300,000 before he reached his first step in the public employment. Cicero rushed into no such danger as this. We know, indeed, that when the time came to him for public expenditure on a great scale, as, for instance, when he was filling the office of Ædile, he kept within bounds, and he did not lavish money which he did not possess. We know also that he refrained, altogether refrained, from the iniquitous habits of making large fortunes which were open to the great politicians of the Republic. To be Quæstor that he might be Ædile, Ædile that he might be Prætor and Consul, and Prætor and Consul that he might rob a province--pillage Sicily, Spain, or Asia, and then at last come back a rich man, rich enough to cope with all his creditors, and to bribe the judges should he be accused for his misdeeds--these were the usual steps to take by enterprising Romans toward power, wealth, and enjoyment. But it will be observed, in this sequence of circumstances, the robbery of the province was essential to success. This was sometimes done after so magnificent a fashion as to have become an immortal fact in history. The instance of Verres will be narrated in the next chapter but one. Something of moderation was more general, so that the fleeced provincial might still live, and prefer sufferance to the doubtful chances of recovery. A Proconsul might rob a great deal, and still return with hands apparently clean, bringing with him a score of provincial Deputies to laud his goodness before the citizens at home. But Cicero robbed not at all. Even they who have been most hard upon his name, accusing him of insincerity and sometimes of want of patriotism, because his Roman mode of declaring himself without reserve in his letters has been perpetuated for us by the excellence of their language, even they have acknowledged that he kept his hands studiously clean in the service of his country, when to have clean hands was so peculiar as to be regarded as absurd.|$|E

Over time the emphasis of Hamblin's written work changed from showing people how to change their lives through right thought and faith, to teaching them {{how to find a}} living consciousness of God for himself alone.|$|E

50|$|Bale’s {{understanding}} of Revelation differs markedly {{from the current}} popular view. For example, he knows nothing of a future Antichrist, a charming wonder working man who will rise up {{at the very end}} of the age. This concept was taught by the Roman Catholic Church, but was refuted by Reformers such as William Tyndale, and also Martin Luther as he matured in his understanding. However, it is again accepted in the popular teachings of dispensationalism. Bale says, however, Antichrist <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>now,</b> in the image of a Church. The opening of the seals describes what happens when God's word is brought forth into the light. He believed that he was living in the time of the opening of the sixth seal, the Reformation, a time of great upheaval when the Scriptures were being freed from the grip of the Church of Rome. He understood the time of the seventh seal to be when God's word would go forth more freely and peacefully: the final season of God's word while the present world stands.|$|E

40|$|The time <b>is</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>now</b> {{when there}} is more {{interest}} than there {{has been in the}} past few months in how to keep food cold, both for the sake of economy and for palatability. The question is, What is the best method of keeping food cold? Refrigerators are being used more and more for this purpose for at least two reasons: they save the many, many steps which must be taken if the food is kept in a cool cellar or well, and they can be much more easily regulated as to temperature and dryness. We have learned to appreciate cool drinks and crisp vegetables on hot days so that the lack of ice as a means of making foods palatable would be a real hardship for many people, but the greatest value of a means of refrigeration comes in the enormous amount of food that can be saved by its use and the transportation of foods to far parts of the country...|$|E

The usefulness of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and associated spatial information technologies are highlighted.
