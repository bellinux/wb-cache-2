2500|$|South <b>Gate</b> <b>Assembly</b> was a General Motors {{automobile}} plant {{located in}} the Los Angeles suburb of South Gate, California. It opened in 1936 to build B-O-P (Buick-Olds-Pontiac) cars for sale on the west coast. It was the first GM plant to build multiple car lines, resulting from a Depression-spawned move to cut production costs by sharing components and manufacturing. South Gate was the second of several B-O-P [...] "branch" [...] assembly plants (the first being the Buick-operated Linden plant), part of GM's strategy to have production facilities in major metropolitan cities. The location was under the management of GM's newly created Buick-Oldsmobile-Pontiac Assembly Division created in 1945.|$|E

40|$|The TM 1088 {{locus of}} T. maritima codes for two {{proteins}} designated TM 1088 A and TM 1088 B, which combine {{to form the}} cytosolic portion of a putative Trk K+ transporter. We report the crystal structure of this assembly to a resolution of 3. 45 Å. The high resolution crystal structures {{of the components of}} the assembly, TM 1088 A and TM 1088 B, were also determined independently to 1. 50 Å and 1. 55 Å, respectively. The TM 1088 proteins are structurally homologous {{to each other and to}} other K+ transporter proteins, such as TrkA. These proteins form a cytosolic <b>gating</b> ring <b>assembly</b> that controls the flow of K+ ions across the membrane. TM 1088 represents the first structure of a two-subunit Trk assembly. Despite the atypical genetics and chain organization of the TM 1088 assembly, it shares significant structural homology and an overall quaternary organization with other single-subunit K+ <b>gating</b> ring <b>assemblies.</b> This structure provides the first structural insights into what may be an evolutionary ancestor of more modern single-subunit K+ <b>gating</b> ring <b>assemblies...</b>|$|R

40|$|The swing-lock {{removable}} partial denture (RPD) {{can address}} some specific partially edentulous situations better than conventional partial denture designs. The concept {{is recommended for}} maximizing stability and retention by access to more tooth surfaces and undercuts with the unique clasping mechanism offered by the incorporation of lock, hinge, and <b>gate</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Since its introduction, the swing-lock RPD has gained some degree of acceptance. However, it is infrequently used by clinicians because it is technique-sensitive, especially during hinge and lock fabrication, and the durability of the retentive element of the locking mechanism decreases with the progressive wear of the metal latch attachment. This article presents a new design for a swing-lock RPD by use of a vertical bar and plastic clip attachment {{as an alternative to}} the hinge and latch attachment.

50|$|Golden <b>Gate</b> <b>assembly</b> uses type II {{restriction}} enzymes cutting {{outside their}} recognition sequences. Also, {{the same type}} II restriction enzyme can generate copious different overhangs on the inserts and the vector, for instance, BsaI creates 256 four-basepair overhangs. If the overhangs are carefully designed, the segments are ligated without scar sequences between them, and the final construct can be quasi-scarless, where the restriction enzyme sites remain {{on both sides of}} the insert. As additional segments can be inserted into the vectors without scars within an open reading frame, Golden Gate is widely used in protein engineering.|$|E
40|$|Sodium channel β-subunits {{modulate}} channel <b>gating,</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{and cell}} surface expression in heterologous cell systems. We generated β 2 −/− mice {{to investigate the}} role of β 2 in control of sodium channel density, localization, and function in neurons in vivo. Measurements of [3 H]saxitoxin (STX) binding showed {{a significant reduction in}} the level of plasma membrane sodium channels in β 2 −/− neurons. The loss of β 2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons. The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced, and the threshold for action potential generation was increased, indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane sodium channels. In contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of Nav 1. 6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged. β 2 −/− mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures, as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures, but seemed normal in other neurological tests. Our observations show that β 2 -subunits {{play an important role in}} the regulation of sodium channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability...|$|R
40|$|Kv 7 {{channels}} (KCNQ) {{represent a}} family of voltage-gated K+ channels which plays {{a prominent role in}} brain and cardiac excitability. Their physiological importance is underscored by the existence of mutations in human Kv 7 genes, leading to severe cardiovascular and neurological disorders such as the cardiac long QT syndrome and neonatal epilepsy. Kv 7 channels exhibit some structural and functional features that are distinct from other Kv channels. Notably, the Kv 7 C-terminus is long compared to other K+ channels and is endowed with characteristic structural domains, including coiled-coils, amphipatic α helices containing calmodulin-binding motifs and basic amino acid clusters. Here we provide a brief overview of current insights and as yet unsettled issues about the structural and functional attributes of the C-terminus of Kv 7 channels. Recent data indicate that the proximal half of the Kv 7 C-terminus associates with one calmodulin constitutively bound to each subunit. Epilepsy and long QT mutations located in this proximal region impair calmodulin binding and can affect channel gating, folding and trafficking. The distal half of the Kv 7 C-terminus directs tetramerization, employing tandem coiled-coils. Together, the data indicate that the Kv 7 C-terminal domain is a multimodular structure playing a crucial role in channel <b>gating,</b> <b>assembly</b> and trafficking as well as in scaffolding the channel complex with signalling proteins...|$|R

40|$|Voltage-gated {{sodium channel}} (Na(v) 1) beta 2 {{subunits}} modulate channel <b>gating,</b> <b>assembly,</b> and cell-surface expression in CNS neurons in vitro and in vivo. beta 2 expression increases in sensory neurons after nerve injury, {{and development of}} mechanical allodynia in the spared nerve injury model is attenuated in beta 2 -null mice. Thus, we hypothesized that beta 2 modulates electrical excitability in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in vivo. We compared sodium currents (I(Na)) in small DRG neurons from beta 2 +/+ and beta 2 -/- mice {{to determine the effects}} of beta 2 on tetrodotoxin-sensitive (TTX-S) and tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) Na(v) 1 in vivo. Small-fast DRG neurons acutely isolated from beta 2 -/- mice showed significant decreases in TTX-S I(Na) compared with beta 2 +/+ neurons. This decrease included a 51 % reduction in maximal sodium conductance with no detectable changes in the voltage dependence of activation or inactivation. TTX-S, but not TTX-R, I(Na) activation and inactivation kinetics in these cells were slower in beta 2 (-/-) mice compared with controls. The selective regulation of TTX-S I(Na) was supported by reductions in transcript and protein levels of TTX-S Na(v) 1 s, particularly Na(v) 1. 7. Low-threshold mechanical sensitivity was preserved in beta 2 -/- mice, but they were more sensitive to noxious thermal stimuli than wild type whereas their response during the late phase of the formalin test was attenuated. Our results suggest that beta 2 modulates TTX-S Na(v) 1 mRNA and protein expression resulting in increased TTX-S I(Na) and increases the rates of TTX-S Na(v) 1 activation and inactivation in small-fast DRG neurons in vivo. TTX-R I(Na) were not significantly modulated by beta 2...|$|R

50|$|Tracks {{used for}} {{professional}} speedway racing are {{regulated by the}} Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) who provide rules concerning construction, size and safety requirements. Speedway racing takes place on a level oval track consisting of two straights joined by two semicircles. Tracks must be between 260 and 425 metres (853 and 1394 ft) in length, this is measured {{at a distance of}} 1 m from the inner boundary. Tracks may be banked, but the gradient must under no circumstances exceed 5% in the straight, 10% in the bends, and must remain constant and grow from the inner edge to the safety fence. A white start line is marked across the track approximately mid-way along one of the straights. The starting area is also divided into four equal parts (known as gates) by white lines marked at right angles to the start line and extending back at least 1 m. Additional rules govern the placement of warning systems such as lights and also the construction of the starting mechanism. The minimum track width is 10 m on the straights and the bends must be at least 14 m wide. The minimum widths give each rider adequate space to safely navigate the track. The start line and starting <b>gate</b> <b>assembly</b> is halfway along one of the two straight sections of the track. Starting gates are simple spring-loaded mechanisms that raise two or three strands of tape to start the race.|$|E
