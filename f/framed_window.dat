They are in operation on all three METRORail lines and can couple to form two-car trains; however, the H3 series is electrically incompatible with the older types and cannot operate with them in the same train.|$|E

50|$|The {{window manager}} uses the first request to {{intercept}} any request for mapping top-level windows (children {{of the root}} window). Whenever another application requests the mapping of a top-level window, the server does not do it but sends an event to the window manager instead. Most window managers reparent the window: they create a larger top-level <b>window</b> (called the <b>frame</b> <b>window)</b> and reparent the original window as a child of it. Graphically, this corresponds to placing the original <b>window</b> inside the <b>frame</b> <b>window.</b> The space of the <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> that is not taken by the original window {{is used for the}} decorative <b>frame</b> around the <b>window</b> (the “border” and the “title bar”).|$|R

50|$|The northern, rear {{facade of}} the building, is lined with a modern steel framed {{verandah}} which {{is linked to the}} rear verandahs of the adjacent buildings on the site. This facade is lined with early timber <b>framed</b> <b>window</b> openings and early doors, with some more recent penetrations.|$|E
50|$|The {{rear section}} of the front wing, which {{contains}} the main Court room, has two-storeyed enclosed arcades on either side.

A balcony in the gable has a round arched opening with concrete moulding, and a juliet balcony with wrought iron tracery between the concrete balustrades.

50|$|The {{facade of}} the three-storeyed Flinders Street section, {{consists}} of four bays separated by paired pilasters with a deep cornice at the roofline concealing a curved corrugated iron roof, which is evident on the southwest end elevation. Each bay, except the second last bay, houses a pair of aluminium <b>framed</b> <b>windows</b> per floor. The other has four windows per floor, with the ground floor having been remodelled with an unbalanced single entry with two windows, and cantilevered awning. The rear of this section has aluminium <b>framed</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|This is {{a single}} {{storeyed}} brick building lined with iron <b>framed</b> <b>window</b> openings. The building has a rectangular floor plan and a gabled roof. Various brick additions {{have been made to}} this structure. The main food preparation area is at the western end of the building and a staff dining room is at the eastern end. This building has a large internal space divided by a concrete partition and remains substantially intact.|$|E
5000|$|No. 6. 137B North Calumet Road, c. 1905, This small story {{shop was}} home to a barber shop until the 1960s. The wooden {{storefront}} seems to be original, with recessed kick panels below a large wood <b>framed</b> <b>window,</b> and the recessed entrance set to the north with single light wood door. The metal awning is from the 1950s. The face brick walls have two double recessed panels on the parapet and a stone coping.|$|E
50|$|Clerehan's {{first house}} for his family, built in 1955, {{was a simple}} two storey flat roofed brick walled {{structure}} with the north face being entirely a then typical 1950s timber <b>framed</b> <b>window</b> wall. Unusually however, this was on an inner city block of Victorian villas, and stood out with its tall all-glass front set well back behind a tall brick fence. The front garden functioned as the main outdoor space, and the living rooms were on the first floor.|$|E
5000|$|Technically, a reparenting {{window manager}} {{registers}} with the X server {{to be notified}} when a top-level window is mapped (attempts to become visible). When such an event is generated, the window manager creates a <b>frame</b> <b>window,</b> {{and in most cases}} also a title bar <b>window.</b> The <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> then becomes the parent of both the main window and the title bar window. Other forms of decoration, such as buttons, window title, etc., may also be created; these would normally be parented by the title bar window.|$|R

In [15], the <b>frame</b> <b>window</b> width {{is the same}} as the pulse width of the signal to be measured and the Gabor frames is not quite redundant. So the sparsity S of the Gabor coefficients recovered for signal representation is very small and the column dimension to row number ratio r of the measurement matrix is large enough to result in good RIP. However, to ensure enough sampling channel number in the sampling scheme proposed here, the E-spline smoothness order N should not be too small. According to [21], if N is large, which means the <b>frame</b> <b>windows</b> are high order exponential reproducing <b>windows,</b> the <b>frames</b> will be very redundant, and so the RIP may be hard to be satisfied [22]. In this study, we find that, for neutralizing the disadvantage caused by the redundancy, the <b>frame</b> <b>windows</b> width W [...]...|$|R

50|$|The rear (northern) {{verandah}} {{has been}} enclosed with weatherboards and louvres {{at the eastern}} end and with vertically joined timbers on the western side. The enclosed area at the western end has early timber framed, sliding glass windows in-situ. Along the eastern elevation, the later gabled extension to the building has two rectangular window openings with each holding three square panes of glass. The window is surmounted by a timber <b>framed</b> <b>window</b> hood. A similar window feature is located along the northern elevation of the later extension.|$|E
50|$|This is a one {{storeyed}} {{rough cast}} rendered brick building, centrally {{located on the}} site adjacent to {{the western side of}} the Demaine Block and behind A Block. This building has a corrugated iron clad hipped roof with a central projecting gable on the former front elevation, which is clad with a decorative Spanish Mission inspired parapeted gable element extending the full height of the building. The building features a number of large, steel <b>framed</b> <b>window</b> opening, comprising a number of hinged operable glazing panels.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{fracturing}} {{in glass}} occurs when sufficient temperature differential is created within glass.As a warmed area expands or a cooled area contracts, stress forces develop potentially leading to fracture. A temperature differential may {{be created in}} many ways including solar heating, space heating devices, fire, hot and cold liquids. Sloping glass surfaces are subject to greater solar radiation than vertical surfaces and so {{are more prone to}} solar thermal fracture. In <b>framed</b> <b>window</b> glass the edges are relatively cooler than the exposed areas so space heating devices in very close proximity may cause thermal fracture.|$|E
50|$|During {{its long}} {{career as an}} {{institution}} and hotel several major alterations {{have been carried out}} to the house. Externally the most notable alteration has been the addition of a bow fronted garden room to the terrace cloister of the garden from the main block and the in-filling of the garden cloister. This appears to have been carried out in the 1930s. The cloister has been in-filled with steel <b>framed</b> <b>windows</b> and doors of typical design of the period. Many of the original casement windows have also been replaced with steel <b>frame</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
