Such public safety-oriented networks are different from classical mobile networks in terms of scale, deployment, and architecture. In this context, we revisit the user association problem, for two main reasons.

Second, the mission-critical nature of the traffic imposes strict guaranteed bit rate constraints, that must be respected when associating users.
