40|$|From the introduction: The {{experiences}} of the Women's <b>Electronic</b> <b>Village</b> <b>Hall</b> (WEVH) a community based ICT access project based in the British city of Manchester present an illustration of how dominant gender-technology discourses have been successfully challenged within a women only training environment. This paper draws on my own experience {{as one of the}} founders and the Director of the WEVH for eight years. The WEVH was one of the very first ICT access centres in Britain, mad occupied a unique position, acting as a model for other women's ICT initiatives and influencing the development and proliferation of other community based ICT initiatives over the past decade. There were two main motivating forces behind the setting up of the WEVH - the first was a shared vision of the potential for ICTs/telematics {{to be used as a}} tool to combat social exclusion and the second was a feminist commitment to redressing the inequalities and under-representation of women in computing. Both these perspectives formed an important backdrop to the growth and development of the organisation and continue to inform its strategic plans...|$|E
50|$|The {{telecentre}} movement’s origins can {{be traced}} to Europe's telecottage and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Village</b> <b>Halls</b> (originally in Denmark) and Community Technology Centers (CTCs) in the United States, both of which emerged in the 1980s as a result of advances in computing. At a time when computers were available but not yet a common household good, public access to computers emerged as a solution. Today, although home ownership of computers is widespread in the United States and other industrialized countries, there remains a need for free public access to computing, whether it is in CTCs, telecottages or public libraries to ensure that everyone has access to technologies that have become essential.|$|R
40|$|Experience {{has shown}} {{there are more}} than enough data with little or no {{information}} avaliable. Nigeria being a country endowed with a lot of resources and whose people is about 170, 123, 740 million[6] needs a way of getting its populace with the necessary information they need. This can only be achieved through connecting people to all their information needs. Despite the huge investment and advancement in ICT, a lot of data has been generated but can be stored, processed and disseminated. With ICT, Nigeria will evolve to the next level of mass connectivity which is the digital nervous system. In this ICT is used to connect all information to the users. This looks at having a repository of information which is diseminated to people through <b>electronic</b> <b>village</b> <b>halls</b> with trained social workers, gsm operators who broadcast certain information to all citizens. The people’s responses are sent to digital nervous system through the social workers...|$|R
