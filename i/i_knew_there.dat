5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E
500|$|... "Crazy in Love" [...] was re-recorded by Beyoncé for {{the film}} Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) and used for its trailer which was {{released}} on July 24, 2014. This slowed-down version was produced by Boots with violin arrangements by Margot, both of whom worked on Beyoncé's fifth studio album. Margot said, [...] "It inspires me to work on other artists' songs [...] it pushes my boundaries {{in a direction that}} I wouldn't necessarily come up with. Obviously I know how 'Crazy in Love' goes, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was the possibility her vocals would be different. It's almost more vulnerable and beautiful this way, because you do do crazy things when you fall in love. To hear the mood reversed and flipped makes it even more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|Higgins {{started writing}} tracks for her second album {{as soon as}} she had {{finished}} recording The Sound of White, which was released in 2004. She said, [...] "I started quite early because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> would a lot of pressure for the second album and I didn't want to write songs under anyone's stopwatch." [...] "100 Round the Bends" [...] was written while she was still recording the first album. During 2006, Higgins spent six months living in Broome, Western Australia, away from the distractions of the entertainment industry. Here she was able to relax and focus on creating new material for her next album. The landscape around Broome inspired the lyrics for [...] "Going North". She said, [...] "It was the first place I'd ever felt honestly connected with my country, with the physical land of my country". The lyrics for [...] "Steer" [...] were inspired when Higgins looked up at the night sky on a Broome beach: [...] "It dawned on me how small we are, how short life is ... I felt so liberated to have finally figured that out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding his {{religious}} beliefs, Carolla has stated, [...] "I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don't {{think there is}} no God; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there's</b> no God. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there's</b> no God the same way <b>I</b> <b>know</b> many other laws in our universe. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>there's</b> no God and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> most of the world knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] {{wanted to make a}} record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E
500|$|The {{reunion of}} the band has been {{characterized}} as dysfunctional by both Barker and DeLonge. Hoppus commented on this era {{of the band}} in a later interview: [...] "Everything was always very contentious. There was always just a strange vibe. [...] <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was something wrong." [...] In his memoir, Can I Say, Barker claims DeLonge's behavior on tour was [...] "introverted" [...] until [...] "money started coming in," [...] after which [...] "he'd get excited about Blink." [...] He states DeLonge abruptly quit sometime in mid-2014, and rejoined the following day. The group planned to begin writing their seventh album in January 2015, which had continually seen delays. [...] "I'd do interviews and I just felt awful for fans because they were promised albums for years and we couldn't do it," [...] Barker later said. A record deal was finalized and sessions were booked before DeLonge's manager informed the band he intended {{to spend more time}} on [...] "non-musical activities" [...] and indefinitely depart the group. In his own statement, DeLonge remarked that he [...] "Never planned on quitting, just find it hard as hell to commit." [...] After these events, Barker summarized the band's reunion: [...] "Why Blink even got back together in the first place is questionable." ...|$|E
500|$|David Giler {{performed}} a rewrite; Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins, friends of Spielberg, suggested the plot device of a kidnapped child. Spielberg {{then began to}} write the script. The song [...] "When You Wish upon a Star" [...] from Pinocchio influenced Spielberg's writing style. [...] "I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me personally." [...] Jerry Belson and Spielberg wrote the shooting script together. In the end, Spielberg was given solo writing credit. During pre-production, the title was changed from Kingdom Come to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. J. Allen Hynek, who worked with the United States Air Force on Project Blue Book, {{was hired as a}} scientific consultant. Hynek felt [...] "even though the film is fiction, it's based for the most part on the known facts of the UFO mystery, and it certainly catches the flavor of the phenomenon. Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another blockbuster after Jaws, but he decided to make a UFO movie. He put his career on the line." [...] USAF and NASA declined to cooperate on the film. In fact, NASA reportedly sent a 20-page letter to Spielberg, telling him that releasing the film was dangerous. In an interview, he said: [...] "I really found my faith when I heard that the Government was opposed to the film. If NASA took the time to write me a 20-page letter, then <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> must be something happening." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Gore became {{involved}} in a finance controversy over his attendance at an event at the Buddhist Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda Heights, California. In an interview on NBC's Today the following year, Gore said, [...] "I {{did not know that}} it was a fund-raiser. I knew it was a political event, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> were finance people that were going to be present, and so that alone should have told me, 'This is inappropriate and this is a mistake; don't do this.' And I take responsibility for that. It was a mistake." [...] In March 1997, Gore had to explain phone calls which he made to solicit funds for Democratic Party for the 1996 election. In a news conference, Gore stated that, [...] "all calls that I made were charged to the Democratic National Committee. I was advised {{there was nothing wrong with}} that. My counsel tells me there is no controlling legal authority that says that is any violation of any law." [...] The phrase [...] "no controlling legal authority" [...] was criticized by columnist Charles Krauthammer, who stated: [...] "Whatever other legacies Al Gore leaves behind between now and retirement, he forever bequeaths this newest weasel word to the lexicon of American political corruption." [...] Robert Conrad Jr. was the head of a Justice Department task force appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Gore's fund-raising controversies. In Spring 2000, Conrad asked Reno to appoint an independent counsel to continue the investigation. After looking into the matter, Reno judged that the appointment of an independent counsel was unwarranted.|$|E

These became known as The Malayan Trilogy and were later published in one volume as The Long Day Wanes.|$|E
2500|$|Knightley {{grew up in}} {{a modest}} {{household}} in Richmond, London, where she attended Stanley Junior School and Teddington School. At the age of six, she was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia but {{by the time she was}} eleven, with her parents' support and much tuition, Knightley said: [...] "they deemed me to have got over dyslexia sufficiently". She is still a slow reader and cannot sight-read. Knightley has noted that she was [...] "single-minded about acting" [...] during her childhood. Speaking of her fascination with acting, she has said: [...] "There was never anything else, I wanted to be a part of my parents' world, even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> are times when you're unemployed". Knightley performed in a number of local amateur productions, which included After Juliet, written by her mother, and United States, written by her drama teacher, Ian McShane. She focused on art, history, and English literature while studying at the Esher College, but left after a year to pursue a full-time acting career.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, roughly 50 million Americans—half the {{population}} at that time—attended the movies every week. As Bow grew into womanhood, her stature as a [...] "boy" [...] in her old gang became [...] "impossible". She {{did not have any}} girlfriends, and school was a [...] "heartache" [...] and her home was [...] "miserable." [...] On the silver screen, however, she found consolation; [...] "For {{the first time in my}} life <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was beauty in the world. For the first time I saw distant lands, serene, lovely homes, romance, nobility, glamor". And further; [...] "I always had a queer feeling about actors and actresses on the screen... I knew I would have done it differently. I couldn't analyze it, but I could always feel it.". [...] "I'd go home and be a one girl circus, taking the parts of everyone I'd seen, living them before the glass." [...] At 16, Bow says she [...] "knew" [...] she wanted to be a motion pictures actress, even if she was a [...] "square, awkward, funny-faced kid." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1986, Bono and {{his wife}} Ali {{travelled}} to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where they saw firsthand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and United States military intervention. The trip angered Bono and {{formed the basis of}} the song's lyrics. He said, [...] "I remember the ground shaking, and I remember the smell, I suppose, of being near a war zone. I don't think we were in danger, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> were lives in danger or being lost close to us, and I felt for them. It upset me as a person who read the Scriptures, to think that Christians in America were supporting this kind of thing, this kind of proxy war because of these Communists." [...] In August, after reconvening with his bandmates in Dublin to resume work on The Joshua Tree, Bono instructed the Edge to [...] "put El Salvador through an amplifier", resulting in the song's feedback-based guitar part. The Edge said that his guitar playing was also informed by Bono's lyrics.|$|E

Next thing <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>there</b> was this chap {{in the long}} grass beside me. A bloody bundle, shrapnel-ripped, legless, one arm only. The one arm reached out to me, white eyeballs wide, unseeing, in the bloody mask {{that had been a}} face. A gurgling voice said, [...] "Help. Kill me." [...] With shaking hands I reached for my small pouch to load my revolver... I had to look for my bullets—by which time somebody else had already taken care of him. I heard the shot. I still remember that gurgling sound. A voice pleading for death....During the war I saw more wounded men being [...] "taken care of" [...] than I saw being rescued. Because sometimes you were too far from a dressing station, sometimes you couldn't get them out. And they were pumping blood or whatever; they were in such a wreck, the only thing to do was to shoot them. And they were, so don't think they weren't.

2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kitana {{was chosen}} as the best Mortal Kombat II fighter by the editors of Sega Power and Super Play for being [...] "good all around" [...] and due to her quick attacks and {{perceived}} similarities to Chun-Li. Amiga Power too called her [...] "a really good character to pick" [...] and Cinema Blend stated Kitana [...] "could absolutely dominate" [...] the game. However, GamePro's strategy guide ranked Kitana as only the seventh best of the 12 fighters in MKII (citing her devastating combos, powerful [...] "Fan Throw" [...] move, and good sweep and reach hindered by slow release of the fan-based special moves and limited attack patterns); it was her clone Mileena who landed on the top of their chart. According to a retrospective by Complex, Kitana [...] "had the most powerful projectile attack, and along with Mileena, the fastest throws and sweeps." [...] "Kitana's big combos in the corner" [...] were among Ed Boon's own personal favourite things in the game: [...] "When I saw people do Kitana's combos <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> was something special, because people were taking the game to a new direction." [...] EGM described Kitana as [...] "a force to be reckoned with" [...] and predicted she would [...] "make a big impact as her Fan Wave leaves foes open to combos." [...] In the Game Gear version of MKII, however, Kitana's fan lifts the opponent too low and too far away for an easy combo.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first section}} {{describes}} Sal's {{first trip to}} San Francisco. [...] Disheartened after a divorce, his life changes when he meets Dean Moriarty, who is [...] "tremendously excited with life," [...] and begins to long for {{the freedom of the}} road: [...] "Somewhere along the line <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>there</b> would be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me." [...] He sets off in July 1947 with fifty dollars in his pocket. After taking several buses and hitchhiking, he arrives in Denver, where he hooks up with Carlo Marx, Dean, and their friends. There are parties—among them an excursion to the ghost town of Central City. Eventually Sal leaves by bus and gets to San Francisco, where he meets Remi Boncoeur and his girlfriend Lee Ann. Remi arranges for Sal to take a job as a night watchman at a boarding camp for merchant sailors waiting for their ship. Not holding this job for long, Sal hits the road again. [...] "Oh, where is the girl I love?" [...] he wonders. Soon he meets Terry, the [...] "cutest little Mexican girl," [...] on the bus to Los Angeles. They stay together, traveling back to Bakersfield, then to Sabinal, [...] "her hometown," [...] where her family works in the fields. He meets Terry's brother Ricky, who teaches him the true meaning of [...] "mañana" [...] ("tomorrow"). Working in the cotton fields, Sal realizes that he is not made for this type of work. Leaving Terry behind, he takes the bus back to Times Square in New York City, bums a quarter off a preacher who looks the other way, and arrives at his Aunt's house in Paterson, just missing Dean, who had come to see him, by two days.|$|E
