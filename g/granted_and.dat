5|$|In {{preparation}} for its buildup in strength, {{the army had}} to train a large cadre of officers. On 10 June 1917 Middleton was assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia, just outside Washington, D.C. as the adjutant of a reserve officer training camp. These camps were organized to take civilians {{and turn them into}} officers in ninety days, and as adjutant Middleton was responsible for directing the flow of paperwork for 2,700 officer candidates. By November 1917, his camp graduated its last class of officers, and Middleton requested to join a combat division. His request was <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> on 21 December 1917 he reported to the 4th Division at Camp Greene near Charlotte, North Carolina. Two days later, however, he received new orders to become the commander of a reserve officer training camp in Leon Springs, Texas. Here, he reported as ordered, and stayed until the mission was complete in April 1918. As he was technically on loan from the 4th Division, his request to rejoin that unit was <b>granted,</b> <b>and</b> Middleton was soon on his way to France.|$|E

The following year, Braathens SAFE applied to extend the route to Tokyo, but this was also rejected by the government. In 1951, the company applied to purchase two Super Constellations to replace two sold DC-4s, which was <b>granted,</b> <b>and</b> on 14 January 1953 for an extension of the concession for another ten years. On 13 November 1953, the government rejected the concession application, stating that Norway was bound to grant the concession to SAS {{on the basis of the}} merger agreement.|$|E
5|$|Having taken {{office in}} 1805, Shaw {{determined}} to re-establish the tradition whereby the Lord Mayor took precedence in public processions within the City of London over all except the reigning monarch, {{and took the}} opportunity of the funeral of Lord Nelson in 1806 to do so.

5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|In late October, Andrić {{left for}} Belgrade. He became {{involved}} in the city's literary circles and soon acquired the distinction of being one of Belgrade's most popular young writers. Though the Belgrade press wrote positively of him, Andrić disliked being a public figure, and went into seclusion and distanced himself from his fellow writers. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with his government job and wrote to Alaupović asking for a transfer to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 20 February, Andrić's request was <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> he was assigned to the Foreign Ministry's mission at the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was <b>granted,</b> <b>and</b> the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that the Fifth Amendment allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E

5|$|Little {{progress}} was made, but in 2005 the Environment Agency and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust promoted {{the formation of}} the Itchen Navigation Trust.

A request was made to the Heritage Lottery Fund in the United Kingdom for funds to restore the watercourse. Known as The Itchen Navigation Heritage Trail Project, funding was <b>granted</b> <b>and</b> a five-year restoration project began. Work has included widening the aperture at College Mead Lock and the construction of a bypass channel around Malm Lock to assist the movement of fish and other aquatic fauna. The navigation has been designated a European Special Area of Conservation as well as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, due to the rich diversity of wildlife found along the system, and its historical importance.|$|E
