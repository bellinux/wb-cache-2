5|$|<b>Hasty</b> {{was laid}} down by William Denny and Brothers, of Dumbarton in Scotland on 15 April 1935, {{launched}} on 5 May 1936 and completed on 11 November 1936. Excluding government-furnished equipment like the armament, the ship cost £248,611. She {{was assigned to the}} 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet upon commissioning. <b>Hasty</b> was refitted in Devonport Dockyard in June–July 1939 and she returned to the Mediterranean afterwards.|$|E
5|$|As {{the court}} gathers the next day, while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser Polonius, Hamlet looks on glumly. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's <b>hasty</b> remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet {{resolves}} {{to see it}} himself.|$|E
25|$|USAT McClellan {{was sold}} by the Army to Belgian company Lloyd Royal Belge SA, in December 1919, and re-entered {{commercial}} service {{for a short time}} as SS <b>Hastier.</b> On 27 October 1920, <b>Hastier</b> arrived at Antwerp, Belgium, with a fire on board, sinking a few days later on 3 November. She was raised in 1921 and laid up. <b>Hastier</b> was sold to Société Métallurgique de Merxem for scrapping on 11 December 1922.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hastier</b> was {{the name}} of two ships {{operated}} by Lloyd Royal Belge.|$|R

5|$|In {{the town}} hall, {{the members of}} the town council decide that it is rather <b>hasty</b> to come to a {{decision}} about creating a new post after just ten years of discussion. They continue agreeing to pass no resolutions on other matters. They discuss Ox's request for a meeting.|$|E
5|$|After Perceval's death, Parliament made generous {{provision}} to his widow and children, and approved the erection of monuments. Thereafter his ministry was soon forgotten, his policies reversed, {{and he is}} generally better known for the manner of his death than for any of his achievements. Later historians have characterised Bellingham's <b>hasty</b> trial and execution as contrary {{to the principles of}} justice. The possibility that he was acting within a conspiracy, on behalf of a consortium of Liverpool traders hostile to Perceval's economic policies, {{is the subject of a}} 2012 study.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} ended, while Stark's militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they {{immediately}} pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark's forces {{tried to hold}} their ground against the new German onslaught, but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner's men {{arrived on the scene}} to reinforce Stark's troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a <b>hasty</b> retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.|$|E

50|$|For his PhD thesis, {{he worked}} in Jeff <b>Hasty's</b> {{laboratory}} at UCSD, where he created synchronized oscillations in bacterial populations through synthetic biological circuits that combined positive and negative feedback with a fluorescent reporter. The resulting paper and corresponding video were published in Nature in 2010.|$|R
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of her seventh and final journey for American Export, Siboney was handed over on 28May 1941 to the U.S.Army for transport duty. After a <b>hasty</b> outfitting, the redesignated USAT Siboney was put to work transporting troops. Based in New York, she made trips {{up and down the}} Atlantic and into the Caribbean, and, by the end of 1941, had called at Bermuda, San Juan, Trinidad, St. John's, Charleston, Newport News, Cristóbal, Jamaica, and Panama.|$|E
5|$|Before Beyoncé began {{recording}} for Dangerously in Love, she {{selected the}} producers {{with whom she}} would collaborate. For two days, she held meetings with prospective producers from the West Coast across the East Coast, and had interviews with them. Beyoncé went to Miami, Florida to begin sessions with Canadian record producer Scott Storch, her first collaborator, and lived in a Miami hotel in the following months. As she wanted {{to concentrate on the}} album, Beyoncé took her time to avoid pressure build-up, significantly different from the <b>hasty</b> productions of Destiny's Child.|$|E
5|$|By nightfall on 18 August, the North Korean 4th Division {{had been}} annihilated; {{huge numbers of}} deserters had {{weakened}} its numbers during the fight, but by that time, Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by the U.S. forces. Scattered groups of North Korean soldiers fled back across the Naktong, pursued by American planes and artillery fire. The next day, the remains of 4th Division had withdrawn across the river. In their <b>hasty</b> retreat, they left {{a large number of}} artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans later pressed into service.|$|E
60|$|That extraordinary, ill-timed laugh made M. de La Tour d'Azyr's {{recovery}} <b>hastier</b> {{and less}} correctly dignified {{than it would}} otherwise have been. It startled and discomposed him, who had already been discomposed by the failure to get home with a lunge so beautifully timed and so truly delivered.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hasty's</b> sons, J.R. and Tyler, played {{football}} at Bellevue High School. J.R. {{played football}} at the University of Washington and Central Washington University but was dismissed from each football program. [...] Tyler redshirted the 2012 football season at Oregon State University but was dismissed {{from the team}} following an arrest.|$|R
25|$|After the war, she {{was renamed}} USAT McClellan and {{employed}} as a U.S. Army transport {{for more than twenty}} years, supplying the garrisons in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Sold in 1919, she briefly returned to mercantile service under the name SS <b>Hastier,</b> until being damaged by a fire in 1920 and subsequently scrapped.|$|R
5|$|On defense, linebacker Vince Hall, in {{his second}} game after {{recovering}} from a broken forearm, led all defensive players with 11tackles. Hall also recorded an interception in the late stages of the fourth quarter that allowed Virginia Tech to run down the clock and force Boston College into a <b>hasty</b> offense. Tied for third overall was Tech's Xavier Adibi, who recorded nine tackles (one for loss) and caught the game-ending interception. Adibi returned the interception 40yards for a defensive touchdown that sealed the victory for the Hokies.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Nerva lacked {{widespread}} {{support in the}} Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist, his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after {{the news of the}} assassination broke. The decision may have been <b>hasty</b> so as to avoid civil war, but neither appears to {{have been involved in the}} conspiracy.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet at the {{beginning}} of World War I consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were not operational. The Navy did have five s under construction in Germany, but a perceived inability to sail the completed submarines past Gibraltar to Pola led to a <b>hasty</b> decision to sell them to Germany, a severe setback for Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hasties</b> Swamp is a {{national}} park in Queensland, Australia, 1,371 km northwest of Brisbane. The swamp is located several kilometers south {{of the town of}} Atherton in Far North Queensland. The main feature of the park is a seasonal wetland. Part of the swamp was first declared {{a national}} park on 5 April 1980.|$|R

50|$|As {{mentioned}} in History, OSMTJ {{was formed by}} a faction of OSMTH in 1970. It was headed by General Antoine (originally Antoni) Zdrojewski , {{until his death in}} 1989. Zdrojewski was succeeded by George Lamirand as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994. George Lamirand was succeeded by Dr. Nicolas Haimovici <b>Hastier</b> who is the current OSMTJ Grand Master today.|$|R
5|$|The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank {{with every}} costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the James River, forcing a siege and trench warfare outside Petersburg, Virginia. Lincoln then made an {{extended}} visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed {{the president to}} confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a <b>hasty</b> visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.|$|E
5|$|The Old Strathcona Foundation {{was running}} a major deficit by 1996, and in April Edmonton City Council {{declined}} to renew a $100,000 annual grant which the Foundation had received since 1985. The Foundation needed cash, and quickly sold the theatre for $450,000 to Calgary’s Brar family, owners of the Plaza Theatre in that city. The decision was not popular, and even Old Strathcona Foundation member Judy Berghofer called the sale <b>hasty.</b>|$|E
5|$|The reverberations of the Black Week defeats {{led to the}} <b>hasty</b> {{approval}} of large reinforcements being sent to South Africa, from both Britain and the Dominions. Although Cronje temporarily defeated the British and held up their advance, General Lord Roberts was appointed as overall Commander in Chief in South Africa; he took personal command on this front, and {{at the head of}} an army reinforced to 25,000 men, he relieved Kimberley on 15 February 1900. Cronje's retreating army was surrounded and forced to surrender at the Battle of Paardeberg on 27 February 1900.|$|E

Other marine {{engineering}} related companies included engine-makers - Kincaids, Scotts, Rankin and Blackmore (which included the Eagle Foundry) - ship repair (Lamonts) and <b>Hasties</b> for steering gear. Yacht builders included Adams and McLean (at Cardwell Bay). Other yards included Cartsburn, Cartsdyke, and Klondyke - {{all of which}} closed during the 1970s and 1980s due to competition from South Korea and Japan.|$|R
50|$|Metrosideros leunigii is {{the oldest}} {{described}} fossil species of the flowering plant genus Metrosideros (Family Myrtaceae), named from fossil flowers and fruits uncovered from the Oligocene (approx. 30 Million years) aged Little Rapid River deposit in Tasmania, Australia, as well as leaves from this deposit and identical leaves from the Eocene aged <b>Hasties</b> deposit, also in Tasmania. These fossils are significant, because they show that Metrosideros once occurred naturally in Australia during the Cenozoic, and has since become extinct.|$|R
5000|$|... 2017- February 20. KFYO {{launches}} a new morning show, [...] "KFYO Mornings with Dave King and Matt Martin".

Dave King owns a local advertising agency, is the stadium announcing {{voice of the}} Goin' Band from Raiderland, and is a former talkshow host for KJTV-AM. Matt Martin is a local realtor who was a fill-in host on Chad <b>Hasty's</b> show.|$|R
5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been <b>hasty.</b> His arms, body, and head had not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E
5|$|A Covenant fleet appears outside Earth's {{defensive}} perimeter {{and begins}} {{an invasion of}} the planet. While the UNSC repels most of the fleet, a single Covenant cruiser carrying an important member of the Covenant hierarchy, the High Prophet of Regret, assaults the city of New Mombasa, Kenya. The Master Chief assists in clearing the city of Covenant; with his fleet destroyed, Regret makes a <b>hasty</b> slipspace jump, and Keyes, Johnson, Cortana and the Master Chief follow aboard the UNSC ship In Amber Clad. The crew discover another Halo installation; realizing the danger the ring presents, Keyes sends the Master Chief to kill Regret while she and Johnson find Halo's key to activation, the Index.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in the Middle East, the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion conducted more training in Palestine until April 1941 when it was transported to Mersa Matruh, where the battalion began a year-long period serving in the garrison role. Towards {{the end of this}} period– January 1942– the battalion was reassigned to the 9th Division and moved to Syria where it undertook further garrison duty as part of the Allied occupation force that had been established after the Syria–Lebanon campaign to defend against a possible German attack across the Caucasus Mountains. This came to an end in late June 1942 when the 9th was rushed to El Alamein to help establish a <b>hasty</b> defence line.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I see, Probus, that I have amazed you,' said he; 'but the Church is {{the only}} subject on which I have no discretion. In all other matters I have conquered the rashness of my early manhood; in this I have to wrestle with my <b>hastier</b> nature still. When I look on the mockeries that are acting around us; when I behold a priesthood deceivers, a people deluded, a {{religion}} defiled, then, I confess it, my indignation overpowers my patience, and I burn to destroy, where I ought only to hope to reform.' ...|$|R

You might have {{observed}} yourself, sir, that I ’aven’t got the knees I once ’ad. The knees and the breathing, there’s where it takes me. But I’m very sure, sir, I address a gentleman as {{would be the last}} to make trouble between friends.’ ...|$|R
60|$|The early Socialism was {{immediately}} millennial. It had no patience. The {{idea was to}} {{be made into a}} definite project forthwith; Fourier drew up his compact scheme, arranged how many people should live in each phalange and so forth, and all that remained to do, he thought, was to sow phalanges as one scatters poppy seed. With him it was to be Socialism by contagion, with many of his still <b>hastier</b> contemporaries it was to be Socialism by proclamation. All the evils of society were to crumble to ruins like the Walls of Jericho at the first onset of the Great Idea.|$|R
