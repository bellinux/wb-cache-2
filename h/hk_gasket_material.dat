In experimental part two types of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers were used as elastomeric plasticizers. Compounds with fifteen different levels of modifiers content (up to 25 % by weight) were prepared and tested. Additionally three commercial compounds were tested as reference formulations. The following test were performed: Shore hardness, short-term and long-term elastic recovery, tensile strength, elongation at break and migration of plasticizers from <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> to unplasticized PVC. Findings: Application of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers as PVC modifier enhanced many properties essential for window <b>gasket</b> <b>materials</b> such as long-term and short term elastic recovery, tensile strength and elongation at break. At the same time addition of these elastomers did not change migration of other plasticizers contained in <b>gasket</b> <b>material.</b> Obtained results indicated that among tested compounds best properties as <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> exhibited plasticized PVC with 23 % of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymer Chemigum P 83.

In experimental part two types of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers were used as elastomeric plasticizers for PVC. Formulations with fifteen different levels of elastomeric modifiers content (up to 25 % by weight) were prepared and tested. As reference formulations three commercial compounds were additionally tested. Shore hardness, short-term and long-term elastic recovery, tensile strength, elongation at break and migration of plasticizers from <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> to unplasticized PVC were searched. Findings: Incorporation of acrylonitrile-butadiene copolymers into PVC enhanced many properties essential for its application as window <b>gasket</b> <b>material.</b> The most important changes occurred for long-term and short term elastic recovery, tensile strength and elongation at break. At the same time addition of these butadiene-acrylonitrile elastomers did not change migration of other plasticizers contained in <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> into rigid PVC in being in contact with gasket.

50|$|Though {{the process}} of peening (surface {{hardening}} by impact) has become rarer in metal fabrication, the ball-peen hammer remains useful for many tasks, such as striking punches and chisels (usually performed with the flat face of the hammer). The peening face is useful for rounding off edges of metal pins and fasteners, such as rivets. The ball face of the hammer {{can also be used}} to make gaskets for mating surfaces.

50|$|The overall {{shape of}} the sample {{assembly}} is a cube (typically around 6mm), this shape allows {{for each of the}} 6 anvils to make contact with each face of the sample assembly. The outer portion of the sample assembly is the pressure medium, which is commonly either boron epoxy (BE) or mullite. The choice of pressure medium used in the sample assembly depends on the ultimate goal of the experiment. Boron epoxy is a self <b>gasketing</b> <b>material</b> in the D-DIA, which means it can produce a seal between all the anvils during deformation, but it has been shown to impart a significant amount of water to the sample during the experiment. This added water to the sample makes it impossible to conduct rheology experiments under anhydrous conditions. The other pressure medium material, mullite, leaves the sample very dry, but does not have the ability to self-gasket in the D-DIA. For this reason, when mullite is used as a pressure medium it needs to be used in combination with a <b>gasket</b> <b>material.</b> Typically the <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> used is pyrophyllite, and the mullite will be machined into a sphere which sits in pyrophyllite “seats”, forming a cube.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{was to find a}} new <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> to be used in {{frequency}} converters manufactured by ABB. The new material has to comply to RoHS directive, because this material is going to replace the currently used material, which is not RoHS compliant. The material is going to be used in conditions, where it may be subjected to chemicals and especially oils, so it should have a good resistance to both. In addition to finding the material, this thesis considers factors affecting elastomer’s swelling in oil. Some requirements were set for the <b>gasket</b> <b>material.</b> The hardness of the material should not be over 60 Shore A and its tear strength should not be less than 23 kN/m. The material should also have a fire classification minimum of V 1. The most important criterion was the oil resistance. <b>Gasket</b> <b>material</b> should not swell more than 25 percent from its initial volume when immersed in oil. The literature part of this thesis consists of introducing four material groups which have such properties which are required from the <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> and considers those properties. These four groups are thermoplastic polyurethanes, styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene, thermoplastic vulcanizate elastomers and co-polyester based elasto-mers. The literature part also discusses the factors which help estimate the amount of swelling based on the structure of the thermoplastic elastomer. The experiment part of this thesis introduces immersion tests which have been used to determine oil resistance of the test materials. Six materials were tested, the names of the materials are confidential, they are coded to be Materials A, B, C, D, E and F. From these results, the best suited material for the new <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> was elected. Also from the results, it was possible to determine dependence of swelling on volume, area, vo-lume/area ratio and density of the sample. One suitable material was found in addition to a few others that require more test-ing. The only geometrical factor found to contribute materials swelling was volume/area ratio. Once the graph is made for a certain material, it helps to predict the swelling of a sample with a certain volume/area ratio made from the same material. The tests made for this thesis will continue after this thesis is completed. Some new sample geometries and new materials will be tested. /Kir 1...|$|R

40|$|Ductile iron (DI) pipes {{have been}} used for the {{conveyance}} of drinking water in drinking water distribution systems over the past several decades. It has been estimated that almost half of all new water mains installed in North America are DI pipes. Although DI pipe itself is resistant to chemical permeation, the polymeric gaskets that join and seal the pipe segments are reported to be susceptible to permeation by organic contaminants. Pipe-drum, diffusion cell experiments, and numerical simulations were conducted in this research to obtain a faster mean to evaluate possible permeations through DI gaskets. Of the five types of <b>gasket</b> <b>materials</b> tested using the gravimetric sorption test, ethylene-propylene-diene monomer (EPDM) had the highest sorption of gasoline, while fluoroelastomer rubber (FKM) exhibited very low sorption of gasoline. The sorption test results suggested that the least to most resistance to permeation of premium gasoline for the five <b>gasket</b> <b>materials</b> were EPDM, styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), chloroprene rubber (CR; neoprene), acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), and FKM. A typical gasket was found to be made of two portions, the heel and the bulb, of the same polymer but different formulation. Gravimetric sorption tests suggested that the heel portion of all gaskets may be more resistant to permeation than the bulb making it the limiting step for permeation of organic compounds in gasoline. Pipe-drum experiments showed that SBR gasket had the highest permeation rates of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), followed by CR, EPDM, and NBR. With regards to threats to drinking water under water stagnation conditions in the pipe, the 5 μg/L maximum contaminant level (MCL) for benzene will likely be exceeded during an 8 -hour stagnation period for SBR gaskets in contact with free-product premium gasoline. NBR gaskets were found to be sufficiently resistant to permeation by benzene or other BTEX compounds in gasoline and the benzene concentration is unlikely to exceed EPA MCLs. Assessment based on data from the pipe-drum experiments suggested that when there is flow of water in the pipe, benzene and other BTEX compounds in gasoline will not exceed EPA MCLs. A diffusion cell device was developed to obtain diffusion coefficients of BTEX compounds for various <b>gasket</b> <b>materials</b> under controlled conditions. Using curve fitting of the permeation data by numerical modeling, the diffusion coefficients of BTEX compounds through SBR and NBR <b>gasket</b> <b>materials</b> was found to range from 10 - 7 to 10 - 8 cm 2 /s. The steady-state permeation rates were found to correlate in a linear relationship with thickness while the diffusion coefficients were found to be invariable to the thickness of the polymer tested (2 mm to 5 mm). The diffusion cell provided a rapid, inexpensive, and relatively well-controlled means to study permeation of polymeric <b>gasket</b> <b>materials</b> for DI pipes and the data obtained were used to model benzene permeation of the pipe-drum experiments. The permeation of benzene through a 4 -inch SBR gasket of a pipe joint was modeled using Multiphysics diffusion module. The simulations showed that the heel portions as well as part of the bulb portions of a gasket were likely to be in contact with the contaminants. Model simulation predicted that a 4 -inch SBR gasket under hydrostatic pressure would permeate more organic chemicals than a pipe without hydrostatic pressure, posing greater risk to organic chemical permeations. Increase in the length/size of the bulb portion of a 4 -inch SBR gasket by compression or swelling from 10 % to 30 %, reduced the permeated mass of benzene by about 29 % to 71 % within 150 days of exposure to gasoline. In summary, SBR and NBR gaskets are compatible with any level of gasoline contamination in groundwater. NBR gasket is the most effective choice when a <b>gasket</b> <b>material</b> resistant to gasoline is desired. Diffusion cell experiments in combination with numerical simulations can be used in evaluating possible BTEX permeations effectively. Gasket exposure area and its orientation in the socket after pipe joint assembly are likely to affect permeation path and permeated mass of contaminants. Results from this study {{can be used as a}} basis for crisis management for DI pipes exposed to gasoline and for development of a better gasket to improve the reliability of infrastructure of development of water distribution system...|$|R
