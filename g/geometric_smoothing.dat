This confirms a conjecture of Kontsevich. We actually prove a stronger statement: D^b_coh(Y) is equivalent to a DG quotient D^b_coh(Ỹ) /T, where Ỹ is some smooth and proper variety, and the subcategory T is generated by a single object. The proof uses categorical resolution of singularities of Kuznetsov and Lunts KL, and a theorem of Orlov Or stating that the class of <b>geometric</b> <b>smooth</b> and proper DG categories is stable under gluing. We also prove the analogous result for / 2 -graded DG categories of coherent matrix factorizations on such schemes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} <b>geometric</b> <b>smoothing</b> {{technique}} for three-dimensional surfaces and images. The technique relies on curvature-dependent deformations of surfaces and the intuition that highly curved regions should move into their convexity by an amount proportional to their curvature. While this intuition in 2 D has lead to a well-defined process and formal theorems about its smoothing properties, {{the development of a}} similar process in 3 D has been confounded by the existence of two directions of bending: when both directions of bending agree (elliptic points) the surface moving into the convexity flattens; however, when directions of bending disagree (hyperbolic points) the situation is ambiguous.

40|$|We {{undertake}} {{to develop}} a general theory of two-dimensional shape by elucidating several principles which any such theory should meet. The principles are organized around two basic intuitions: first, if a boundary were changed only slightly, then, in general, its shape would change only slightly. This leads us to propose an operational theory of shape based on incremental contour deformations. The second intuition is that not all contours are shapes, but rather only those that can enclose "physical" material. A theory of contour deformation is derived from these principles, based on abstract conservation principles and Hamilton-Jacobi theory. These principles {{are based on the}} work of Sethian [82, 86], the Osher-Sethian level set formulation [65], the classical shock theory of Lax [53, 54], as well as curve evolution theory for a curve evolving as a function of the curvature and the relation to <b>geometric</b> <b>smoothing</b> of Gage-Hamilton-Grayson [32, 37].

To this end, this paper puts forward an approach to topological optimization of hex mesh based on frame field and sheet operations, which improves the quality of the worst elements of the hex mesh by optimizing its topological structure. The approach first builds an initial frame field on the input hex mesh and optimizes it to obtain a high-quality frame field. Then, the problematic sheet that leads to the poor quality of the hex mesh is determined according to the initial and optimized frame fields. Finally, the structure of the problematic sheet is adjusted based on the high-quality frame field and sheet operations.

40|$|Structural {{optimization}} is a {{field of}} research that has experienced noteworthy growth for many years. Researchers in this area have developed optimization tools to successfully design and model structures, typically minimizing mass while maintaining certain deflection and stress constraints. Numerous optimization studies have been performed to minimize mass, deflection and stress on a benchmark cantilever truss problem. Predominantly traditional optimization theory is applied to this problem. The cross-sectional area of each member is optimized to minimize the aforementioned objectives. This paper will present a structural optimization technique that has been previously applied to compliant mechanism design. This technique demonstrates a method that combines topology optimization, geometric refinement, finite element analysis, and two forms of evolutionary computation: Genetic Algorithms and Differential Evolution to successfully optimize a benchmark structural optimization problem. An non-traditional solution to the benchmark problem is presented in this paper, specifically a geometrically refined topological solution.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to subdivision based {{on the evolution of}} surfaces under curvature motion is presented. Such an evolution can be understood as a natural geometric filter process where time corresponds to the filter width. Thus, subdivision can be interpreted as the application of a geometric filter on an initial surface. The concrete scheme is a model of such a filtering based on a successively improved spatial approximation starting with some initial coarse mesh and leading to a smooth limit surface. In every subdivision step the underlying grid is refined by some regular refinement rule and a linear finite element problem is either solved exactly or, especially on fine grid levels, one confines to a small number of smoothing steps within the corresponding iterative linear solver. The approach closely connects subdivision to surface fairing concerning the <b>geometric</b> <b>smoothing</b> and to cascadic multigrid methods with respect to the actual numerical procedure.

40|$|The use {{of energy}} methods and variational {{principles}} is widespread in many fields of engineering of which structural mechanics and curve and surface design are two prominent examples. In principle {{many different types}} of function can be used as possible trial solutions to a given variational problem but where piecewise polynomial behaviour and user controlled cross segment continuity is either required or desirable, B-splines serve as a natural choice. Although there are many examples of the use of B-splines in such situations there is no common thread running through existing formulations that generalises from the one dimensional case through to two and three dimensions. We develop a unified approach to the representation of the minimisation equations for B-spline based functionals in tensor product form and apply these results to solving specific problems in <b>geometric</b> <b>smoothing</b> and finite element analysis using the Rayleigh-Ritz method. We focus on the development of algorithms for the exact computation of the minimisation matrices generated by finding stationary values of functionals involving integrals of squares and products of derivatives, and then use these to seek new variational based solutions to problems in the above fields. By using tensor notation we are able to generalise the methods and the algorithms from curves through to surfaces and volumes. The algorithms developed can be applied to other fields where a variational form of the problem exists and where such tensor product B-spline functions can be specified as potential solutions.
