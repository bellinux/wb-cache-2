5|$|After {{structural}} design on alternate body styles encountered obstacles, Ford offered the Pinto solely as a two-door sedan, with <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> models priced at $1850, undercutting GM's Chevrolet Vega and directly targeting imported models — which included such new competitors as the Mazda 1200 in 1971, the Subaru DL in 1972, and the Honda Civic in 1973.|$|E
5|$|On May 30, 2013, Bozon {{signed a}} three-year <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> {{contract}} with the Canadiens. He was returned by the Canadiens to the Blazers for a third year with the team {{prior to the start}} of the 2013–14 season. After starting the season with the Blazers, where he was fifth in team scoring with seven points in thirteen games, Bozon was traded to the Kootenay Ice on October 22, 2013. The Blazers, who also sent defenceman Landon Cross, received Colin Shirley, Matt Thomas, and three draft picks in return.|$|E

5|$|Recreational divers {{are trained}} in the theory and {{practice}} of decompression {{to the extent that the}} certifying agency specifies in the training standard for each certification. This may vary from a rudimentary overview sufficient to allow the diver to avoid decompression obligation for <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> divers, to competence in the use of several decompression algorithms by way of personal dive computers, decompression software, and tables for advanced technical divers. The detailed understanding of decompression theory is not generally required of either commercial or recreational divers.|$|E
5|$|Referred to during {{development}} as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82, it was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair {{to highlight the}} machine's colour display, compared with {{the black and white}} of its predecessor, the ZX81. The Spectrum was released as eight different models, ranging from the <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> with 16KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128KB RAM and built in floppy disk drive in 1987; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide (not counting clones).|$|E
5|$|The E Series Clubsport R8 {{takes its}} {{fundamental}} body structure {{from the mainstream}} VE Commodore. It is also the standard model in the HSV line-up. With the deletion of lower lines of V8 HSV models the Clubsport slipped down to the <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> HSV V8, {{on a par with}} the Manta of the VR-VS-VT series. As such the sales of E Series Clubsports has been over shadowed by the sales of the E Series GTS.|$|E
40|$|This paper adopts an {{evolutionary}} framework {{to the study}} of industrial resilience. We present a study on European regions and assess {{the extent to which the}} capacity of their economies to develop new industrial specializations is affected by the global economic crisis of 2008. We compare <b>levels</b> of industry <b>entry</b> in European regions in the period 2004 - 2008 and 2008 - 2012, i. e. before and after a major economic disturbance. Resilient regions are defined as regions that show high <b>entry</b> <b>levels</b> or even increase their <b>entry</b> <b>levels</b> after the shock. Industrial relatedness and population density exhibit a positive effect on regional resilience, especially on the entry of knowledge-intensive industries after the shock, while related variety per se shows no effect on regions being resilient or not. regional resilience, evolutionary economic geography, new growth paths, related variety, industrial relatednes...|$|R

5|$|An <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> diver {{must learn}} the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at {{a high risk of}} drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{was drafted}} by the New York Rangers in the sixth round (157th overall) of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft, having {{obtained}} the sixth round pick from the Carolina Hurricanes {{earlier in the day}} in exchange for defenseman Bobby Sanguinetti. Fast was the fifth of six players the Rangers drafted in 2010, along with Dylan McIlrath, Christian Thomas, Andrew Yogan, Jason Wilson and Randy McNaught. On May 29, 2012, the Rangers announced Fast had been signed to a two-way, three-year <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> contract, valued at $2.145 million, with a $900,000 annual cap hit. Since HV71 was eliminated from the 2012–13 playoffs earlier than expected, Fast had the opportunity to go to the New York Rangers organization sooner than originally planned. The Swedish Hockey League initially voiced objections, but eventually agreed to loan him to the Rangers.|$|E
5|$|Just over a {{year after}} being drafted, Brewer signed his first {{professional}} contract with his draft team, the New York Islanders, in August 1998. Entering the NHL, Brewer {{was regarded as a}} future Norris Trophy candidate, and as a result, his contract was an <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> three-year, $2.775-million deal complemented by a $1-million signing bonus, the highest base salary available for a rookie. Brewer made his NHL debut on October 10, 1998, against the Pittsburgh Penguins, and on November 5, Brewer scored his first career goal against the Carolina Hurricanes' Trevor Kidd. Throughout his rookie season, Brewer was considered {{an integral part of the}} Islanders' defence, and, along with Zdeno Chára, Kenny Jönsson and Roberto Luongo, was considered untouchable by management at the 1999 NHL trade deadline. Brewer finished his rookie season with eleven points in 63 games.|$|E

5|$|On September 10, 2004, Weber {{signed a}} three-year, $1.425-million <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> {{contract}} with the Nashville Predators. A {{year and a half}} later, Weber made his NHL debut on January 6, 2006, versus the Detroit Red Wings, recording three shots on goal in 11:08 minutes of icetime. Three months later, on April 6, 2006, he scored his first NHL goal against Reinhard Divis of the St. Louis Blues in a 3–0 Nashville victory. Weber went on to play in 28 games during his rookie season, finishing with two goals and ten assists. He also scored two goals in four playoff games with the Predators before the team was eliminated in the first round by the San Jose Sharks. With Nashville's AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals, still in playoff action, Weber was reassigned to the Admirals roster {{for the remainder of the}} AHL playoffs. He compiled six goals and five assists in 14 games during his time with the Admirals, who finished in second place in the Calder Cup, losing to the Hershey Bears in six games in the Calder Cup Finals.|$|E
5|$|Single {{cylinder}} {{consists of}} a single large cylinder, usually back mounted, with one first-stage regulator, and usually two second-stage regulators. This configuration is simple and cheap but it has only a single breathing gas supply: it has no redundancy in case of failure. If the cylinder or first-stage regulator fails, the diver is totally out of air and faces a life-threatening emergency. Recreational diver training agencies train divers {{to rely on a}} buddy to assist them in this situation. The skill of gas sharing is trained on most <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> scuba courses. This equipment configuration, although common with entry-level divers and used for most sport diving, is not recommended by training agencies for any dive where decompression stops are needed, or where there is an overhead environment (wreck diving, cave diving, or ice diving) as it provides no functional redundancy.|$|E
5|$|Upon being drafted, Kesler {{considered}} {{returning to}} Ohio State for his sophomore season or joining the Brampton Battalion, who still held his OHL rights. However, {{less than two}} months after being drafted, Kesler signed a three-year, $2.475-million <b>entry</b> <b>level</b> contract with the Canucks, complemented by an $850,000 signing bonus. After attending Canucks training camp and playing in five preseason games, Kesler was cut by the Canucks and sent to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Manitoba Moose. Kesler began his first professional season with the Moose, but was recalled by the Canucks in November and made his NHL debut on November 24, 2003 in a 2–1 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs, recording one shot on goal and 12:12 of ice time. He scored his first career NHL goal on November 29 against Calgary Flames goaltender Jamie McLennan in a 4–4 tie. For the remainder of the season, Kesler split time between the Canucks and the Moose, finishing his season with five points in 28 Canucks games and eleven points in 33 Moose games.|$|E
50|$|The {{participation}} {{level of}} the race has followed an upward trend: by 1988 {{the number of participants}} had increased to 8,700 - up from the 4,000 the previous year. It was not until 2000 that the 1988 participation record was finally broken when 8,900 took part. An increasing number of people took part every year in the late 2000s, with 11,000 at the 2007 edition. <b>Entry</b> <b>levels</b> have since increased significantly year-on-year with 19,500 completing the 2016 event.|$|R

50|$|There are {{multiple}} <b>entry</b> <b>levels</b> into nursing. This {{has led to}} confusion for the public, {{as well as other}} healthcare professionals. The earliest schools of nursing offered a Diploma in Nursing and not an actual academic degree.
