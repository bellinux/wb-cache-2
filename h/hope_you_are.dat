500|$|The {{chief of}} {{thoracic}} surgery, Benjamin L. Aaron, decided {{to perform a}} thoracotomy lasting 105 minutes because the bleeding persisted. Ultimately, Reagan lost over half of his blood volume {{in the emergency room}} and during surgery, which removed the bullet. In the operating room, Reagan removed his oxygen mask to joke, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> all Republicans." [...] The doctors and nurses laughed, and Giordano, a liberal Democrat, replied, [...] "Today, Mr. President, we are all Republicans." [...] Reagan's post-operative course was complicated by fever, which was treated with multiple antibiotics. The surgery was routine enough that they predicted Reagan would be able to leave the hospital in two weeks and return to work at the Oval Office within a month.|$|E
500|$|Booker {{has never}} been married, and in 2013 he was named one of Town & Country’’s [...] "Top 40 Bachelors". Although he has {{generally}} tried to keep his personal life private, Booker {{has in the past}} described himself as a [...] "straight male" [...] and has said that he is trying to date more in hopes of finding someone to settle down with. [...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what does it matter if I am? So be it. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I'm straight." ...|$|E
500|$|Warner {{learned from}} twelfth man Leo O'Brien that Woodfull was badly injured. Later in the afternoon, while Ponsford and Richardson were still batting, Warner and Palairet visited the Australian {{dressing}} {{room with the}} intention of enquiring about Woodfull's health. Accounts vary about what followed. According to the original newspaper reports and Fingleton's later description, Woodfull was lying on the masseur's table, awaiting treatment from a doctor, although this may have been an exaggeration for dramatic effect. Leo O'Brien described Woodfull as wearing a towel around his waist, having showered. Warner expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it." [...] Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present. Warner recalled saying, [...] "Apart from all that, we most sincerely <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not too badly hurt," [...] to which Woodfull replied, [...] "The bruise is coming out." [...] Embarrassed and humiliated, Warner and Palairet turned and left. Fingleton noted that Woodfull spoke quietly and calmly, which increased the effectiveness of his words. He also pointed out that Warner prided himself on sportsmanship, so an accusation of [...] would have stung the Englishman. Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.|$|E

2500|$|The {{report of}} the {{convention}} in the New York Tribune for Europe inspired women in Sheffield, England, {{to draw up a}} petition for woman suffrage and present it to the House of Lords and Harriet Taylor to write The Enfranchisement of Women. Harriet Martineau wrote a letter to Davis in August 1851 to thank her for sending a copy of the proceedings: [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> aware of the interest excited in this country by that Convention, the strongest proof of which is the appearance of an article on the subject in the Westminster Review ...I am not without hope that this article will materially strengthen your hands, and I am sure it can not but cheer your hearts." ...|$|E
