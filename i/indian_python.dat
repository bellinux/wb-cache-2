25|$|Sundarbans West Wildlife Sanctuary is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The region {{supports}} mangroves, including: sparse {{stands of}} Gewa (Excoecaria agallocha) and dense stands of Goran (Ceriops tagal), with discontinuous patches of Hantal palm (Phoenix paludosa) on drier ground, river banks and levees. The fauna {{of the sanctuary}} is very diverse with some 40 species of mammals, 260 species of birds and 35 species of reptiles. The greatest of these being the Bengal tiger of which an estimated 350 remain in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Other large mammals are wild boar, chital horin (spotted deer), Indian otter and macaque monkey. Five species of marine turtles frequent the coastal zone and two endangered reptiles are present – the estuarine crocodile and the <b>Indian</b> <b>python.</b>|$|E
50|$|Reptiles like <b>Indian</b> <b>pythons,</b> <b>Indian</b> cobras, krait, rat snakes, vipers, keelbacks {{and grass}} snakes are nocturnal animals, and are {{therefore}} rarely seen. There are many species of turtles as well as amphibians found {{in or near the}} water bodies.|$|R

500|$|In the summer, Indian {{elephants}} {{can be seen}} in {{herds of}} several hundred. The <b>Indian</b> <b>python</b> found in the reserve is a [...] dangerous species, capable of killing a chital deer. Local crocodiles and gharials were saved from extinction by captive breeding programs that subsequently released crocodiles into the Ramganga river.|$|E
2500|$|Africa's largest {{snake and}} one of the six largest snake species in the world (along with the green anaconda, {{reticulated}} python, Burmese python, <b>Indian</b> <b>python,</b> and amethystine python), specimens may approach or exceed [...] The southern subspecies is generally smaller than its northern relative. The snake is found in a variety of habitats, from forests to near deserts, although usually near sources of water. The snake becomes dormant during the dry season. The African rock python kills its prey by constriction and often eats animals up to the size of antelope, occasionally even crocodiles. The snake reproduces by egg-laying. Unlike most snakes, the female protects her nest and sometimes even her hatchlings.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{non-native}} snakes {{have been released}} in the wild. In 2010 the state created a hunting season for Burmese and <b>Indian</b> <b>pythons,</b> African rock pythons, green anacondas, and Nile monitor lizards.|$|R

5000|$|The {{classification}} of the Burmese python as a subspecies of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Python</b> is not scientifically accepted anymore. Recent publications {{to include the}} [...] "Zur taxonomie des dunklen tigerpythons, Python molurus bivittatus Kuhl, 1820, speziell der population von Sulawesi" [...] in 2009 by Hans Jacobs et al. has established that the Burmese python is not a subspecies of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Python.</b> This is {{in addition to the}} 1999 report “The Burmese Python is a questionable subspecies of the <b>Indian</b> <b>Python,</b> Python molurus” which was coauthored by Dr. Rodda. To further this belief herpetologist will point {{to the fact that the}} United States Fish and Wildlife Service does not consider the <b>Indian</b> <b>Python</b> to be the same species as the Burmese Python.

2500|$|The reptile {{house or}} the serpentarium is built, {{at the cost of}} [...] 0.4 million, in a twining snake-like model with {{entrance}} and exit points in the snake's mouth and tail, respectively. The house was opened to public in the year 1989 and has 24 enclosures exhibiting 4 species of poisonous and 10 species of non-poisonous snakes. It contains a total of 104 snakes, including 41 <b>Indian</b> <b>pythons,</b> 21 Burmese pythons and four cobras. The park has initiated controlled breeding programme for <b>Indian</b> rock <b>python.</b> Each vivarium has been renovated by changing substratum and providing perch and hide outs. The top of the opening in RCC roof is closed with transparent acrylic sheet to avoid rain and the walled enclosure enables the snake to exhibit all natural behaviours. The king cobra is scientifically kept and maintained in constant temperature by providing air conditioning and hot spot.|$|R
50|$|Reptiles in {{the park}} include the king cobra, spectacled cobra, Russell's viper, saw-scaled viper, common krait, <b>Indian</b> rock <b>python,</b> rat snake, vine snake, green or bamboo pit viper and monitor lizards.|$|R
5000|$|In India, the {{nominate}} subspecies {{grows to}} 3 m on average [...] This value {{is supported by}} a 1990 study in Keoladeo National Park, where the biggest 25% of the python population was 2.7 - 3.3 m long. Only two specimen even measured nearly 3.6 m. Because of confusion with the Burmese python, exaggerations and stretched skins in the past, the maximum length of this subspecies is hard to tell. The longest scientifically recorded specimen, which hailed from Pakistan, was 4.6 m in length and weighed 52 kg. [...] In Pakistan, <b>Indian</b> <b>Pythons</b> commonly reach a length of 2.4 - 3 m.|$|R
