40|$|Over {{the years}} various {{theoretical}} frameworks {{have been developed}} to gain insight into the strong force at the hadronic scale and several of them make predictions for the pion photoproduction cross-section at threshold. The cross-sections for positive and neutral pion photoproduction have been measured, but experimental data on the negative pion has so far been absent. The first measurement of the cross-section σ(E) for π− photoproduction on the deuteron near threshold is presented. The π− cross-section provides a test for the theoretical models that aim to describe Quantum Chromodynamics in the non-perturbative regime. Nucleon polarisabilities are long range nucleon structure observables and give insight into the internal degrees of freedom of the nucleon. The proton polarisabilities are determined significantly more accurately compared to the neutron polarisabilities.
