40|$|Introduction. Recombinant human {{erythropoietin}} (r-HuEPO) is used {{to treat}} symptomatic anaemia due to chemotherapy. A new r-HuEPO, <b>Epoetin</b> <b>theta</b> (Eporatio ®), was investigated and compared to placebo and Epoetin beta in a randomised, double-blind clinical trial in adult cancer patients receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, using a fixed weekly starting dose of 20, 000 IU <b>Epoetin</b> <b>theta.</b> The primary efficacy endpoint was the responder rate (complete Hb response, Hb increase � 2 g/dL) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{recombinant}} human erythropoietins and allied proteins (epoetin alfa, attempted copies and biosimilar variants of epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin delta, epoetin zeta, <b>epoetin</b> <b>theta,</b> epoetin omega, darbepoetin alfa, and methoxy-polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta) {{are among the}} most successful and earliest examples of biotechnologically manufactured products to be used in clinical medicine. This article charts a brief history of their use in clinical medicine, mainly dealing with chronic kidney disease, paying special attention to how these agents were introduced into clinical medicine and what has happened subsequently; in 2009, there were several developments that could be regarded as a “perfect storm ” in terms of the long-term use of these compounds in chronic kidney disease and oncology and, likely, elsewhere. We are now very much at a “crossroads, ” where mature reflection is required, because with the latest trials and meta-analyses, these therapies seem not only expensive but also very much a clinical tradeoff (increased risk of adverse effects versus a small gain in fatigue scores). How we arrived at this crossroads is a useful illustration of how easy it is, without properly designed randomized, controlled trials, to assume that clinical benefit must follow therapeutic interventions.

40|$|Anemia is a {{frequent}} complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to {{the inability of the}} kidneys to release sufficient erythropoietin to regulate the production of red blood cells. Administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) is highly effective in correcting anemia of CKD. The ESAs currently approved in Italy are epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, <b>epoetin</b> <b>theta,</b> darbepoetin alfa, CERA and biosimilars epoetin alfa and epoetin zeta. All the ESAs are effective in correcting renal anemia and increasing hemoglobin levels, but the choice of which to use should also take into account their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, their administration route, and economic issues. However, regarding the optimal use of ESAs an issue that remains controversial is the most appropriate dose conversion between epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa. In fact clinical experience demonstrates that the dose relationship between epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa is non proportional across the dosing spectrum. In this review is presented an update on the latest available evidence in the treatment of anemia in CKD patients, with particular reference to the definition of the correct conversion ratio EPO:DARB. </span...|$|E

As in the preceding reviews, clinical efficacy is assessed as a function of therapeutic equivalence of biosimilar versus reference product and, in the cancer setting, also superiority over placebo; while safety is evaluated in terms of immunogenicity, venous thromboembolism and mortality. Four studies on patients with chronic kidney disease and three studies on oncology patients are reviewed. In the renal setting, these include two randomized controlled trials on hemoglobin maintenance in hemodialysis and predialysis patients; as well as two open-label extension studies in these populations that also include Phase II patients. Studies in the cancer setting include three randomized controlled trials; in patients with solid tumors receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, in patients with either solid tumors or hematological malignancies receiving non-platinum based chemotherapy, and in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing antineoplastic therapy. Based on the available data, the clinical and safety outcomes of treatment with XM 01 are likely to be {{similar to those of the}} comparator product NeoRecormon® and superior over placebo. Both XM 01 and NeoRecormon® can be considered interchangeable in the management of anemia in the approved indications. Patients transferred from reference product to biosimilar can be expected to show the same efficacy and safety outcomes. There is no evidence for the interchangeability of XM 01 with other biosimilar or originator erythropoietins. In keeping with EMA guidance about traceability, it is recommended that clinicians document the product prescribed by its commercial name, especially when switching patients from originator to biosimilar or vice versa.

40|$|Background: Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) {{increase}} {{red blood}} cell production in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA). In Europe, short-acting ESAs (epoetin alfa, epoetin beta, epoetin zeta, and <b>epoetin</b> <b>theta)</b> and a long-acting ESA (darbepoetin alfa) are available to treat CIA. Objective: This systematic review aimed to determine potential dose efficiency {{associated with the use}} of different ESAs for the treatment of CIA according to European labeling. Methods: A systematic review of ESA studies with starting doses according to European labeling was conducted according to published methodology. Measures of dose efficiency were defined as mean weekly doses to achieve target hemoglobin level or final dose and dose adjustments (dose increase, decrease, or withheld). Electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched up to July 2012. Data were selected for analysis using an evidence hierarchy and quantitatively analyzed to assess statistical homogeneity. Where pooling of data was not appropriate, a narrative summary with descriptive statistics (medians and ranges) was reported. Results: Fifty-five studies met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-five studies considered to represent the highest level of evidence were extracted and included in the analysis. The analysis showed a high degree of statistical heterogeneity, often precluding metaanalysis. The patients included in the analysis were representative of those encountered in clinical practice, and patient characteristics were similar between the short-acting and the darbepoetin alfa groups. Mean weekly doses appeared similar to 30 % lower with darbepoetin alfa versus short-acting ESAs (median, 136. 5 mu g or 27, 300 RI [range, 21, 560 - 38, 260 IU] vs 38, 230 IU [range, 31, 634 - 42, 714 RI], respectively), resulting in a mean weekly dose ratio of 1 : 280. Darbepoetin alfa patients appeared to need fewer dose increases compared with short-acting ESAs (pooled, 0. 75 %; I- 2 = 21 % vs median 26. 6 % [range, 7. 6 %- 44. 6 %]) and more dose decreases (median, 74 % [range, 57 %- 75 %] vs 22 % [range, 2. 8 %- 59 %]). A similar percentage of darbepoetin alfa and short-acting ESA patients required a dose to be withheld (20 % and 33 % [2 studies] vs median 33. 2 % [range, 12. 6 %- 51. 1 %]). Conclusions: Statistical heterogeneity between studies was high, although clinically the studies represented medical practice. Without randomized clinical trials directly comparing darbepoetin alfa and short-acting ESAs, these findings are tentative and future research is warranted. This review shows that good-quality, reliable data from head-to-head trials are lacking. The best available evidence comes from prospective ESA-arm data. Mean weekly doses, dose increases, and dose decreases suggest a dose efficiency for darbepoetin alfa compared with short-acting ESAs...|$|E
