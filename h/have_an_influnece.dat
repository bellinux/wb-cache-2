In the paper a homomorphic filter algorithm is designed for removing shadow, through the analysis {{of the relationship between the}} shadow and the brightness of the image. Firstly the image from RGB form is converted to HSV form, based on the relationship between the variation of the Vcomponent and the shadow, the components of the related shadow can be identified. Then a filter is designed, which uses the principle of homomorphic filtering to filter the component of the related {{shadow in the}} image. Finally, a new complete image is formed by using the method of image synthesis to incorporate the treated V-component into the original image. The experiment results show that this method can remove the cast shadows in the image effectively, which has improved the image quality for the subsequence image processing...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} extent to which the {{educational}} attainments of a generation are reproduced in Great Britain. We address a very specific question [...] what was the effect, among people born around the middle of the 20 th century, of <b>having</b> acquired <b>a</b> University degree on the probability of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> child who also acquires a degree? We consider the two central processes involved: the effect of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> degree on whether or not <b>a</b> person <b>had</b> <b>a</b> child and, conditional on having at least one child, the effect of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> degree on whether at least one child acquired a degree.
