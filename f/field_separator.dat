5000|$|Logographic {{languages}} such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (known {{collectively as}} CJK) need {{far more than}} 256 characters (the limit of a one 8-bit byte per-character encoding) for reasonable representation. The normal solutions involved keeping single-byte representations for ASCII and using two-byte representations for CJK ideographs. Use of these with existing code led to problems with matching and cutting of strings, the severity of which depended on how the character encoding was designed. Some encodings such as the EUC family guarantee that a byte value in the ASCII range will represent only that ASCII character, making the encoding safe for systems that use those characters as <b>field</b> <b>separators.</b> Other encodings such as ISO-2022 and Shift-JIS do not make such guarantees, making matching on byte codes unsafe.

40|$|High {{gradient}} magnetic <b>field</b> <b>separators</b> {{have been}} widely used in a variety of biological applications. Recently, the use of magnetic separators to remove malaria-infected red blood cells (pRBCs) from blood circulation in patients with severe malaria has been proposed in a dialysis-like treatment. The capture efficiency of this process depends on many interrelated design variables and constraints such as magnetic pole array pitch, chamber height, and flow rate. In this paper, we model the malaria-infected RBCs (pRBCs) as paramagnetic particles suspended in a Newtonian fluid. Trajectories of the infected cells are numerically calculated inside a micro-channel exposed to a periodic magnetic field gradient. First-order stiff ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governing the trajectory of particles under periodic magnetic fields due to an array of wires are solved numerically using the 1 (st) - 5 (th) order adaptive step Runge-Kutta solver. The numerical experiments show that in order to achieve a capture efficiency of 99 % for the pRBCs it is required to have a longer length than 80 mm; this implies that in principle, using optimization techniques the length could be adjusted, i. e., shortened to achieve 99 % capture efficiency of the pRBCs...|$|R

40|$|The {{transport}} and separation {{of oil and}} water is a vital process to the oil and chemical industries. Fluids exiting from oil wells usually consist of gas, oil and water and these three phases need to be transported and separated {{before they can be}} processed further. Operation of the primary separators has often proved to be problematic due to the change in composition of the fluids as the well matures, often accompanied by the build up of sand or asphaltenes. These vessels are very expensive to install so there is motivation to improve their design and performance. One major factor affecting separator performance is the phase distribution of the inlet flow, as reflected in the flow pattern and droplet size. In this work, flow pattern boundaries and drop sizes of liquid-liquid dispersions were measured for vertical and horizontal flow of a kerosene and water mixture in a 0. 063 m tube. Drop size was investigated by using two different laser optical techniques. A laser backscatter technique was employed for concentrated dispersions and a diffraction technique was used at low concentrations. In order to develop a greater understanding of separator performance, a 1 / 5 th-scale model was constructed of diameter 0. 6 m and length 205 m. Residence Time Distributions were obtained for a range of different internal configurations and flow rates using a colorimetric tracer technique. Flow rates of 1. 5 - 4 kg/s oil and 1 - 4 kg/s water were used and the vessel was equipped with a perforated flow-spreading baffle at the inlet and an overflow weir. Experiments were performed with no internals and with dip or side baffles. The side baffles acted to create quiescent zones within the vessel while the dip baffle caused a local acceleration of both phases. These situations are similar to those that can be caused by blocked internals or existing baffling or structured packing within <b>field</b> <b>separators.</b> A Residence Time Distribution model of a primary separator, the Alternative Path Model, was developed using transfer functions. This model has the ability to reproduce features of the experimental data by representing the flow as a series of continuous stirred tanks in series or in parallel. The model was used to develop parameters {{that could be used to}} obtain information about the performance of the separator. This model was also applied to Residence Time Distribution data obtained from <b>field</b> <b>separators</b> by BP Exploration, to relate features of the pilot scale <b>separator</b> to the <b>field</b> vessels...|$|R

40|$|One puzzling {{observed}} {{property of}} coronal loops {{is that they}} are of roughly constant thickness along their length. Various studies have found no consistent pattern of width variation along the length of loops observed by TRACE and SOHO. This is at odds with expectations of magnetic flux tube expansion properties, which suggests that loops are widest at their tops, and significantly narrower at their footpoints. Coronal loops correspond to areas of the solar corona which have been preferentially heated by some process, so this observed property might be connected to the mechanisms that heat the corona. One means of energy deposition is magnetic reconnection, which occurs along <b>field</b> lines called <b>separators.</b> These <b>field</b> lines begin and end on magnetic null points, and loops forming near them can therefore be relatively wide at their bases. Thus, coronal energization by magnetic reconnection may replicate the puzzling expansion properties observed in coronal loops.

Œ and œ are French ligatures, and Ÿ is needed in French all-caps text, as it is present in a few proper names such as the city of l'Haÿ-les-Roses or the poet and writer Pierre Louÿs. Later, {{four of the six}} characters proposed for deletion were deleted, and four more new characters were added. These characters, however, were in many other ISO standards. Š, š, Ž, and ž are used in some loanwords and transliteration of Russian names in Finnish and Estonian typography. It had been proposed to put the Euro Sign in place of the plus-minus sign instead of the currency sign (used in some applications as a <b>FIELD</b> <b>SEPARATOR</b> and by some other applications for SUBTOTAL accounting function; ¢ was proposed to remain to avoid confusion; +- would be a fallback). There was strong opposition on this. One said [...] "The proposed «+-» is not an adequate fall-back, as this sequence, though rarely used, has already a fixed mathematical meaning, quite different from «±»; and even, if a reader would deduce the intended meaning, «±», from the context, «+-» in lieu of «±» will hurt a physicist's æsthetic feelings {{at least as much as}} «oe» in lieu of an o-e ligature a Francophone's." [...] As a result of the opposition, people had proposed to keep the plus-minus sign and remove the currency sign instead. As diacritics are frequently dropped in all-caps text in French (even though the Académie française discourages this practice), a code point for Ÿ wasn't deemed necessary for ISO-8859-1, even though one was given for its lower-case equivalent ÿ (at 0xFF).|$|E
