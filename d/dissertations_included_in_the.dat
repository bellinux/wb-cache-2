The papers, proceedings and <b>dissertations</b> <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> analysis were identified technology acceptance as the focus of their studies. This search was supplemented various websites which host scientific journals such as Emerald, Science Direct and Google Scholar. The initial search produced 65 papers. The studies examined works which employed UTAUT and UTAUT 2 by focusing on findings on the core constructs of UTAUT to predict Behavioral Intentions. The results confirmed previous studies that the four constructs of UTAUT contributed to Behavioral Intention even though PE seemed to be the most significant contributors. Findings also suggest UTAUT 2 has been more explanatory and list the suggestions for future works. The immediate implications are for researchers who wish to examine behavioral intentions, and managers who wish to ensure the acceptance and use of a new system or technology. This study bears a number of limitations. Number of papers examined is one of them. It would be more accurate {{to increase the number of}} paper examined. The other limitation is the ability to draw a statistical conclusion each research examined. This is due to a great variety of research topics, methods, constructs and contexts. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{impact of}} {{university}} libraries was analyzed by investigating {{the availability of}} the references of dissertations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> university s own library. A special attention was given to the electronic availability of cited works. Methodology: Citation analysis was used. Ten dissertations of economics and administration from two Finnish universities were analyzed. The dissertations were completed in 2005 - 2006. The comparison of the availability of references in two different universities, a large, multidisciplinary university and a small, specialized university, was carried out.   Findings: The availability of the references of dissertations was good in both universities. A large part of references, especially journal articles, were already available electronically. The university libraries have a significant role <b>in</b> contributing to <b>the</b> doctoral studies, because they offer the access to adequate information resources.   Research limitations: The sample is quite limited: only two Finnish universities and ten <b>dissertations</b> were <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> data. The good availability of references might result from doctoral students unwillingness to search sources outside.   However, doctoral students do not cite all sources that they read. The impact of the library on the doctoral studies can be even bigger than we can show by citation analysis.   Practical implications: The paper indicates that the citation analysis is a good tool <b>in</b> promoting <b>the</b> library s impact. Originality/value: The paper emphasizes that the impact of libraries can be demonstrated by presenting the visibility of their collections in dissertations. Because of the rapid change of information environment, the study considered the availability of electronic sources of dissertations. The interesting comparison between two different universities was carried out.   Keywords: Library collections, Doctoral dissertations, Citation analysis, References, Electronic sources, Availabilit...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study is two-fold: to determine the extent to which archivists and graduate school deans are aware of the preservation standards regarding theses and dissertations as well as the attitudes of arrhivists concerning responsibility for the care and storage of these documents; and to ascertain the actual physical condition of theses and dissertations. To accomplish this, two surveys were sent to these institutions: one to graduate colleges presumed responsible for drafting standards for production of dissertations to ascertain those standards; the other to archivists to determine the level of care dissertations receive while in their custody, knowledge of national standards, and attitudes concerning responsibility for storage. To determine whether concern over deterioration of dissertations is warranted, a condition survey of Kent State University's <b>dissertations</b> was conducted. <b>Included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> appguldices are: a list of archivists and graduate school deans surveyed; the archivists survey; the deans survey; and the book condition survey.

Due to this ambiguity it is difficult to equally compare evidence in this field across different countries. A context-specific systematic review on the qualitative evidence of the experience of being an advanced practice nurse in Australia has not been undertaken previously, however it is imperative for nursing managers and leaders to understand the complexities of advanced nursing roles in order to effectively utilise and retain these experienced and valuable nurses. With the creation of a national nursing regulating authority in 2010, it is timely to explore in-depth the experience of being an advanced practice nurse from a national perspective. OBJECTIVE To identify the experience of being an advanced practice nurse working in Australian acute care settings.

40|$|This <b>dissertation</b> <b>includes</b> two essays. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first essay, I use Major League Baseball ticket data, both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{primary market}} and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{secondary}} market, from one anonymous franchise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2011 season {{to study how}} the franchise can price dynamically to increase its revenue.

The potential sources of long term competitive advantage are cooperation and information sharing among firms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> international supply chain. The author hypothesised that cooperation and information sharing are positively related to logistics capabilities. Logistics capabilities are hypothesised to be positively related to customer satisfaction. To capture the impact of external environment, the lead time uncertainty and the demand uncertainty have been <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> model. The impact of modern information technologies on supply chain management has not been disregarded and information technologies serve as moderating variable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> model. The proposed model is based on the Transaction costs theory and the Resource-Based View. The qualitative research method of case studies had been selected and used to support the model. The research involves three cases. Interviews with professionals, company sources and secondary data mainly academy journals, supply chain management literature and web pages of selected companies and international institutions provided the foundation for the research. The contribution of this <b>dissertation</b> is <b>in</b> <b>including</b> <b>the</b> impact of <b>the</b> external forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> model, <b>in</b> focusing on <b>the</b> relationships that a firm has with its supply chain partners, and in an in-depth analysis of relationships among triad of subjects [...] buyer, seller and logistics service provider.

40|$|This <b>dissertation</b> <b>includes</b> two essays. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first essay, I {{proposed}} an alternative estimator for multivariate densities. This estimator {{can be characterized}} as a transformation based estimator. The first stage estimates each marginal density separately. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second stage, the joint density of estimated marginal cumulative distribution functions (CDF) are approximated by the exponential series estimator. The final estimate is then obtained as the product of the marginal densities and the joint density estimated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second stage. Extensive Monte Carlo studies show the proposed estimator outperforms kernel estimators in joint density and tail distribution estimation. An illustrative example on estimating the conditional copula density between S & P 500 and FTSE 100 given Hangseng and Nikkei 225 is also discussed. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second essay, I extended the semiparametric model by Chen and Fan [X. Chen, Y. Fan, Estimation of copula-based semiparametric time series models, Journal of Econometrics 130 (2006) 307 - 335], and studied a class of univariate copula-based nonparametric stationary Markov models <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> copulas and the marginal distributions are estimated nonparametrically. In particular, I focused on the stationary Markov process of order 1 with continuous state space because it has the beta-mixing property for the analysis of weakly dependent processes. The copula density functions for time series models are approximated by the series estimate on sieve spaces. In this study, a finite dimensional linear space spanned by a sequence of power functions is treated as the sieve space where the estimation space of the copula density function is based. This sieve series estimator {{can be characterized as}} the exponential series estimator under mild smoothness conditions. By using the beta-mixing properties, I showed that the copula density function approximated by the exponential series estimator for stationary first-order Markov processes has the same convergence rate as the i. i. d. data. The Monte Carlo simulations show that the proposed estimator outperforms <b>the</b> kernel estimator <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conditional density estimation, except for the Frank copula-based Markov model. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> proposed estimator considerably dominates the the kernel estimator when used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> one-step-ahead forecast...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2013. Major:Economics. Advisors: Fabrizio Perri and Timothy J. Kehoe. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 75 pages, appendix A. <b>The</b> <b>dissertation</b> <b>includes</b> two essays. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first essay I {{try to explain}} the slow recovery of the U. S. economy after the 2008 - 2009 recession. I develop a theory <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> slow recovery is due to continuing weak consumption demand arising from slowly resolved aggregate uncertainty. An exogenous belief shock creates uncertainty about firms' credit availability. This translates into income uncertainty at the household level because firms have to borrow from banks in order to hire workers. In response, household demand is low, which in turn causes firms to borrow little and produce little. This low level of economic activity impedes the resolution of uncertainty regarding credit availability. Therefore, the economy stagnates with high uncertainty, low demand, and low output, {{even though there is}} no shock to fundamentals. The resolution of uncertainty is not efficient because households do not fully internalize the effect of increasing their own demand on improving the quality of information. This leaves room for government intervention. Quantitatively my model generates a slow recovery, which is comparable to U. S. employment data. Model pre- dictions are also consistent with U. S. county level data: counties with cheaper access to household credit have higher employment but all counties recover at <b>the</b> same rate. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second essay, which is co-authored with Yun Pei, we try to understand the impact of sovereign default on the lending countries. We develop a model in which banks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lending countries can buy foreign sovereign bond, provide loan to domestic firms and borrow from domestic households. We find that a sovereign default in foreign countries can result in an output drop <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lending countries, because the default can worsen the balance sheet of banks. Therefore default risk in foreign countries can be transmitted to output risk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lending countries. However, {{this does not mean that}} <b>the</b> governments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lending countries should limit the purchase of foreign sovereign bond. A tax on the purchase of sovereign bond reduces the output fluctuation but also decreases the welfare of domestic bankers and households...|$|R
40|$|This <b>dissertation</b> <b>includes</b> {{original}} research <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{fields of}} behavioral public economics and political economy. The first chapter provides evidence from a field experiment testing whether exposure to relative earnings information impacts worker effective labor supply. I exogenously manipulate {{access to information}} about relative position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distribution of worker earnings {{as well as the}} shape of the distribution among workers engaged in piece rate, web-based clerical work. There are four main findings. First, those exposed to information about their placement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earnings distribution provide significantly more labor effort on average than those with no information about peer earnings. Second, labor supply elasticity with respect to net of tax wages, a key sufficient statistic for optimal income tax policy, is unchanged between the two groups. Third, the higher productivity observed among workers exposed to relative earnings information is driven by those workers who experienced an exogenously assigned high relative earnings rank and low average comparison group earnings. Fourth, this later finding is gendered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sense that women supply more labor regardless of whether they learn they occupy high or low relative standing while men supply significantly more labor only upon learning they occupy high relative standing. A model of worker preferences that incorporates status concerns is shown to reconcile these seemingly disparate findings in contrast to several alternatives considered. These findings suggest that governments can potentially use relative earnings information to grow the tax base - but not to affect optimal labor income tax rates - and that firms can generate significant productivity boosts simply by providing workers with information about the earnings of their peers. The second chapter addresses an entirely different question, namely, the efficacy of violent forms of protest. It takes as its point of departure the acknowledgment that estimating the effect of violent forms of political protest on protest success is complicated by endogeneity and omitted variable bias. To address this problem, I utilize instrumental variables methods to estimate a causal effect of violent protest on the likelihood that protesters win policy concessions. Using daily French protest data and a set of weather and school holiday instruments, I find a significant and negative relationship between property destruction associated with protests and the chance of near-term success <b>in</b> changing policy. <b>The</b> IV estimates are larger than OLS estimates and are robust to a variety of alternative specifications. Such findings are predicted by several posited endogeneity channels, and, they suggest that political violence does not, in fact, pay off...|$|R

A proposta da dissertação é incluir na metodologia de cálculo da PVI um fator que represente, além de um valor econômico razoável, a importância da linha de transmissão no sistema no momento em que ocorre uma indisponibilidade. Para isso, foi adotado o princípio do EBE - Equivalent Bilateral Exchanges [3] ou intercâmbios bilaterais equivalentes que define o uso de uma determinada linha de transmissão para uma determinada condição de carga do sistema, considerando um fluxo de carga linear. Com essa definição, procurou-se relacionar a importância de uma linha de transmissão com a variação causada no uso do sistema antes e depois de uma indisponibilidade em relação ao uso da linha de transmissão antes da mesma se tornar indisponível. Foram {{realizadas}} simulações envolvendo sistemas de 5, 14 e 24 barras onde procurou-se mostrar que valores diferentes de PVI poderiam ser atribuídos a diferentes linhas de transmissão de um sistema, de acordo com a importância elétrica da linha e sem afetar o equilíbrio econômico-financeiro da empresa. Por fim, foram levantadas e analisadas algumas características de aplicação do método proposto e procurou-se também mostrar que o Sistema Interligado Nacional - SIN apresenta características de robustez semelhantes àquelas que foram consideradas para as simulações dos sistemas elétricos propostos. __________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThis work {{presents a}} proposal for the formula of implementation of VPU focused on TF - Transmission Line.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2008. 1. Developed a {{framework}} of decision-making behavior on the choices of remuneration practices in fishery based on the principal-agent theory. Empirically, we apply the switching regression model to check if the theoretical prediction reflects experience of Hawaii's longline fishery. 2. Developed a procedure to estimate the risk parameters of prospect theory's utility function which provides a more complete description of preferences, but is also more complex to estimate than the utility function portrayed by expected utility theory. In terms of research methodology, we match experimental data with survey data. The combination of data from experimental economics surveys and household data allows us to estimate the prospect theory parameters and to explore how these parameters are determined. 3. Applied the target revenue model, a version of prospect theory, to see how having target revenue may {{have an impact on}} the captain's decision on the length of a fishing trip. This alternative approach may result in different prediction from the standard model regarding the relationship between daily fishing revenue and the number of fishing days. To investigate which model provides a more reasonable description of the reality, we look at the empirical evidence from the Hawaii-based longline fishery. <b>The</b> <b>dissertation</b> <b>includes</b> three essays. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first essay, we investigate a recent phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remuneration system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of Hawaii-based longline fishery. The aim of this dissertation is to apply frontier microeconomic theories to provide additional insights into the economic behaviors of fishermen. In particular, we investigate how a fishing vessel's captain or owner makes two of the most important decisions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fishing business using Hawaii-based longline fishery as a case study. One decision relates to the choice of remuneration practice; the other is concerned with the fishing trip length. The underlying factor of these decision-making processes is the risk behavior of the vessel's captain or owner. The role of risk preferences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decision-making process is especially emphasized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of such a risky profession as fishery. Given that, we also explore the question whether fishermen have different risk patterns from workers in other occupations. Most previous studies addressed this question from the expected utility theory perspective and assumed that fishermen like other workers are risk-averse. In this research, we address this question by applying prospect theory and experimental economics methodology to directly estimate the parameters used as proxy for risk behavior as well as to explore how these parameters are determined. The dissertation essays make contribution to the field of fishery economics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following ways:The <b>dissertation</b> <b>includes</b> three essays, we investigate a recent phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remuneration system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of Hawaii-based longline fishery.

The underlying factor of these decision-making processes is the risk behavior of the vessel's captain or owner. The role of risk preferences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decision-making process is especially emphasized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of such a risky profession as fishery. Given that, we also explore the question whether fishermen have different risk patterns from workers in other occupations. Most previous studies addressed this question from the expected utility theory perspective and assumed that fishermen like other workers are risk-averse. In this research, we address this question by applying prospect theory and experimental economics methodology to directly estimate the parameters used as proxy for risk behavior as well as to explore how these parameters are determined. The dissertation essays make contribution to the field of fishery economics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following ways: 1. Developed {{a framework}} of decision-making behavior on the choices of remuneration practices in fishery based on the principal-agent theory. Empirically, we apply the switching regression model to check if the theoretical prediction reflects experience of Hawaii's longline fishery. 2. Developed a procedure to estimate the risk parameters of prospect theory's utility function which provides a more complete description of preferences, but is also more complex to estimate than the utility function portrayed by expected utility theory. In terms of research methodology, we match experimental data with survey data. The combination of data from experimental economics surveys and household data allows us to estimate the prospect theory parameters and to explore how these parameters are determined. 3. Applied the target revenue model, a version of prospect theory, to see how having target revenue may {{have an impact on the}} captain's decision on the length of a fishing trip. This alternative approach may result in different prediction from the standard model regarding the relationship between daily fishing revenue and the number of fishing days. To investigate which model provides a more reasonable description of the reality, we look at the empirical evidence from the Hawaii-based longline fishery. <b>The</b> <b>dissertation</b> <b>includes</b> three essays. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first essay, we investigate a recent phenomenon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remuneration system <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of Hawaii-based longline fishery. Specifically, I aim at answering the question why fixed wage has become more popular than share contract <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hawaii's longline fishery. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second essay, I address risk behavior of Vietnamese fishermen by applying prospect theory and data from an economic experiment <b>in</b> Vietnam. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> third essay, the target revenue model, a version of prospect theory, is used to explain how decision on the number of days for a fishing trip is made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of the Hawaii-based longline fishery...|$|R

A total of 40 male patients with atypical pneumonia caused by mycoplasma pneumoniae were <b>included</b> <b>in</b> this research. Clinical diagnosis of community acquired pneumonia was defined as acute infection with increased temperature and roentgenological finding of pulmonary infiltrate. Etiological diagnosis of disease was confirmed with serological testing. A control group included 20 healthy male examinees of similar age as the patients. The average age of our patients was 19 years. The patients were most commonly hospitalized on the fifth day of illness. Clinical presentation of disease was mild up to moderately severe, in accordance with laboratory results on admission. Chest X-ray recorded interstitial inflammatory infiltrates in one (28 or 70 %), or multiple lobes (12 or 30 %), and pleural effusion was recorded in 6 or 15 % of patients. Favorable clinical response to administered antibiotic therapy was recorded in all patients. More severe disease complications were not recorded during hospitalization. MMP- 2 gene expression was not recorded in any sample obtained from patients, nor from the control group of examinees. In 31 patients with acute stage of disease, 30 reconvalescents, i. e. 19 control examinees we recorded gene expression of IL- 8, MCP- 1, MIP- 1 β and MMP- 9. MCP- 1 gene expression was decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> majority of patients and did not significantly differ between the patients and the control group. IL- 8 gene expression statistically significantly increased <b>in</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acute phase of disease and during reconvalescence compared to the control group (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 013; p= 0, 001). Similarly, gene expression of MIP- 1 β was statistically significantly increased <b>in</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acute phase of disease and in reconvalescence compared to control group (Mann-Whitney test; p< 0, 001; p= 0, 001). MMP- 9 gene expression was statistically significantly increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acute phase of illness compared to control group and reconvalescents (Mann-Whitney; p= 0, 001; p= 0, 016). Spearman`s correlation test in our patients showed correlation between gene expression of MIP- 1 β and neutrophils count <b>in</b> peripheral circulation. <b>The</b> concentration of IL- 8, MCP- 1, MIP- 1 β, MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 was measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> serum of 30 patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acute phase of disease, 36 reconvalescents and 12 control examinees. By analyzing the level of examined chemokines and metalloproteinases, we recorded a statistically higher level of IL- 8 <b>in</b> patients <b>in</b> <b>the</b> acute phase of illness than among those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 033). Similarly, the level of MMP- 9 was higher compared to control examinees, but without statistical significance (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 062). The levels of MCP- 1 and MMP- 2 in acute patients were statistically significantly lower than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group of patients (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 012; p= 0, 001) while the level of MIP- 1 β did not significantly differed between the patients and healthy examinees. Spearman`s correlation test showed statistical significance correlation between leukocytes count in peripheral circulation and IL- 8 levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> patients`s sera. No statistically significant difference was found in IL- 8 and MMP- 9 concentration in patients with pleural effusion (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 613; p= 0, 726). Also, no statistically significant difference was detected in IL- 8 and MMP- 9 concentration between patients with two or more pulmonary lobes affected (Mann-Whitney test; p= 0, 228; p= 0, 403). These results could contribute to further research that should explain immunopathogenic mechanisms in pneumonia caused by mycoplasma pneumoniae...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} research around {{the question of}} how companies may improve their R&D processes through collaborative R&D activities. The growing need to gain access to new technologies, the need to share risks and costs associated with the development of new products, and the shortening of market opportunity windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ICT industry leads to a rising number of R&D Alliances formed every year. In an industry where the ruling imperative of "innovate or die" has been replaced with "collaborate or die" (Chesbrough 2003, Bruce et al. 1995), improving an organization's collaborative capability is a necessity for survival <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marketplace. By combining qualitative – a multiple action research case study – and quantitative – an international survey – research methods, the dissertation at hand sheds light on {{the question of how}} companies can improve their collaboration capability through inter-partner process learning <b>in</b> R&D Alliances. <b>The</b> theoretical waters that this dissertation navigates spring from the research on inter-organizational learning in R&D alliances on one hand, and on process innovation on the other. Within the many inter-organizational learning theories, the Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) framework of knowledge sharing and creation became the guiding lighthouse for this research. <b>The</b> <b>dissertation</b> <b>includes</b> four essays. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first essay, a set of measures for process learning is developed based on a two-case action research study with three Finnish companies from the telecommunications industry. The cases reveal a set of distinct improvements of collaborative R&D processes: the establishment of joint project planning and evaluation meetings, improved prototyping, improved release management, the establishment of joint milestones, the clear division of tasks and responsibilities, and increased inter-departmental and cross-functional interaction. These findings provide practitioners with a benchmark for improvements in collaborative R&D processes. A subset of these learning results is successfully used to measure process learning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following three essays. These remaining essays are all based on an international survey amongst 105 companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> telecommunications industry. The second essay looks into the process of process learning, by investigating how four knowledge creation mechanisms – socialization, externalization, combination and internalization – function in process learning. To my knowledge the study is the first to test the Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) model of knowledge creation empirically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of inter-organizational learning. The results give strong support to their theory and provide the practitioner with insight into the optimal mix of knowledge transfer mechanisms used for communication <b>in</b> collaborative R&D. <b>The</b> process learning measure developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first essay is rated by two independent members of each organization, and validated through inter-rater correlation analysis. The third essay reports on a descriptive study exploring different approaches to process knowledge creation <b>in</b> R&D alliances. <b>The</b> results show that the alliances developing radical as opposed to incremental innovations differ from each other in terms of various partner-specific and alliance-specific characteristics as well as their process learning outcomes. The group of companies that focused on developing incrementally-improved products were more experienced collaborators, utilized various knowledge transfer mechanisms more often, and also scored higher in all three areas of process learning measured than companies developing new, more radical technologies and products, or companies that did not focus on one kind of innovation, but engaged in developing both incremental and radical innovations. The fourth essay investigates how the competitive situation, the overlap of organizational knowledge bases and the existence of trust <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collaboration relationship influence the effectiveness of meetings, written documents and transfer of people as means for knowledge transfer. The results suggest that competition positively influences the effect of all three types of knowledge transfer mechanisms on learning. The complementarity of the partner organizations' knowledge bases promotes the effectiveness of Meetings and Documents, and the existence of behavioral trust increases the effectiveness of transfer of people as knowledge transfer mechanisms for process learning. This research is the first to test the widespread organizational learning model of Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) empirically, in an inter-organizational setting. The findings support the model, and verify that it can be applied to inter-organizational process learning. Additionally, the study contributes to research by specifically mapping knowledge transfer mechanisms to each phase of the socialization-externalization-combination-internalization process (SECI) developed by Nonaka and Takeuchi. The study also develops and empirically verifies a measure for process learning in R&D Alliances. Previous research often tries to measure knowledge transfer success based on proxies such as improved productivity (e. g. Argote 1999, Arrow 1962), number of new products introduced (Tsai 2001), reduced lead-time and waste (Kalling 2003) or increased share price (Anand & Khanna, 2000). Since these proxies are also influenced by a number of other factors than successful knowledge transfer or learning, this study develops a more direct approach: Process learning is measured through specific improvements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collaborative R&D process that are acquired and implemented through collaboration with a partner company. For the interested manager, the study provides insight into how the knowledge transfer between two partnering companies can be managed in order to enable successful inter-partner process learning. The dissertation also provides a benchmark for process improvements for collaborative R&D processes. reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Cycling in Belgium {{represents}} one of the main transportation means to work and school, and is a popular recreational activity. However, road traffic is inherently unsafe. Traffic safety was not considered as a relevant goal when initially designing traffic infrastructure, and although efforts are being made to accommodate the wide range of road users, road accidents can still result from errors or unpredictable actions. The kinetic forces resulting from <b>the</b> differences <b>in</b> mass and velocity of crash opponents largely dictates the severity of the outcomes. Especially severe crash outcomes are expected for vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and cyclists who lack by far the same level of protection offered to cars and other vehicle occupants. Moreover, single bicycle crashes are also a source of injuries through falls and collisions with obstacles, which can result in serious traumas, especially for elderly population of cyclists and those not wearing a helmet. In view of all these observations, head injury represents a real economic, social and health burden on society. Along the years a lot of research has been employed in order to improve our understanding of head injury mechanism, to develop appropriate lesion-specific tolerance criteria, and to improve protective and preventive measures. Despite all efforts, the field of head injury biomechanics still raises many unanswered questions and debates. For almost 13 years, the multidisciplinary Bicycle Helmet research group concentrated its research activity efforts on the head injury biomechanics field, with the main goal of providing lesion-specific head injury criteria and developing a new helmet prototype that offers a better head protection in a bicycle accident. The goals of the present dissertation are situated within this framework. <b>In</b> view of <b>the</b> formulated goals, this dissertation is structured as follows: Chapter 1 describes the context and the aim of the global research project, the position of <b>the</b> current research <b>in</b> <b>the</b> context of the global project and the specific hypotheses and research questions of <b>the</b> current dissertation. <b>In</b> Chapter 2, <b>the</b> validity of an energy criterion for skull fractures is investigated. Despite all progress made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of skull fracture biomechanics, the mechanism of skull fracture is far from being fully understood. The investigation comprises a series of experimental head impacts in various anatomical locations, using a double pendulum set-up. The methodology allowed for the calculation of the biomechanical force-deflection response and energy-absorbing characteristics of the skull. The resulting data indicated the skull to have nonlinear structural response suggesting the existence of an energy failure level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range of 5 - 15 J for temporal dynamic loading conditions. It is likely that energy criteria impact location dependent have the potential to accurately predict skull fracture by encompassing impact as well as structural characteristics. <b>In</b> Chapter 3, <b>the</b> aim is to assess brain-skull relative motion in quasistatic circumstances and to correlate cortical regions with high motion amplitudes with predilection sites for cerebral contusions. Brain-skull relative motion plays a primordial role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> etiology of devastating head injuries. The investigation included thirty healthy volunteers scanned using a clinical 3 Tesla MR scanner in four different head positions. Through image processing and 3 D models registration, pairwise comparisons were performed to calculate the brain shift between sagittal and coronal head positional change. Next, local brain deformation was evaluated by comparison between cortical and ventricular amplitudes. Finally, the influence of age, gender, and skull geometry on the cortical and ventricular motion was investigated. The results described complex brain shift patterns, with high regional and inter-individual variations. Regions with maximum motion amplitudes were identified at the inferolateral aspects of the frontal and temporal lobes, congruent with predilection sites for contusions. The results of this project contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the frontotemporal contusion mechanopathogenesis and are useful for the optimization of finite element head models and neurosurgical navigation procedures. Chapter 4 focuses on the separate description of the various brain motion components building further on <b>the</b> data generated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> MRI experiment described <b>in</b> chapter 3. <b>The</b> rigid body motion of the brain was extracted by means of a rigid-body algorithm employed using SPM 8. 0. The net brain displacement reported <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current study did not vary significantly from 0, the maximum translational displacement being as high as 1. 3 mm and maximum rotation angle being 0. 85. Larger brain motion amplitudes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sagittal direction resulted when gravitational force had a similar orientation. Due to skull symmetry <b>in</b> <b>the</b> coronal plane and the falx as a fibrous interhemisferic partition not interfering with <b>the</b> resulting motion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sagittal direction, the out of plain motion of the brain was less pronounced after a prone-supine head positional change. <b>In</b> contrast, under <b>the</b> gravitational force acting <b>in</b> lateral direction <b>the</b> brain not only translates along the gravitational axis, but also significantly rotates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sagittal and axial plane <b>The</b> observations made <b>in</b> this investigation study contribute to a better understanding of the brains dynamic behaviour and of the relation between brain motion and specific brain injury mechanopathogenesis. New insights on <b>the</b> boundary conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human head are extremely helpful for improvement and validation of finite element models. Chapter 5 presents an investigation on the bridging veins-superior sagittal sinus failure mechanism under axial stretch in relation with ASDH mechanopathogenesis. In this study, bridging vein-superior sagittal sinus (BV-SSS) units were axially stretched until failure for strain rates ranging from 2. 66 s- 1 to 185. 61 s- 1, in order to investigate any strain rate dependency in their mechanical behaviour. The results show that up to 200 s- 1, the effect of the strain rate on the veins mechanical behaviour is outweighed by the large morphological intra- and inter- individual variations. The veins dimensions had the strongest influence on the BV mechanical behaviour and on the failure mechanism. The study brings important contribution to ASDH research, emphasising the importance of considering the BV-SSS complex as a whole when trying to describe the ASDH mechanopathology. The research on head injury biomechanics described in this dissertation has helped to fine tune and to define better lesion-specific tolerance criteria. Nevertheless it contributes to the development of more detailed and more accurate finite element models in which extrapolation is possible. Hence, a final aspect discussed <b>in</b> this <b>dissertation</b> and <b>included</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> appendix and relates to the investigation on the mechanical characterisation of the helmets by using the finite element method as a first step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> helmet optimisation and improvement process. The relation between different parameters (materials properties, vents number and localization, etc.) and the risk of head injury is evaluated. Different finite elements models were built to compare the mechanical behaviour of the different types of cyclist helmets during the impact using MSC Marc Mentat. The linear acceleration and the energy absorption were evaluated for a better understanding of the mechanism through which the helmet protects the head during an impact. The finite element study showed that all materials studied will protect the head by reducing the linear acceleration by more than 80 % and stress values into the head by more than 65 %. The anisotropic foam studied seems to offer the best protection against linear acceleration, stress and deformation, showing promising results for the use of anisotropic foams <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of improving the head protection offered by a headgear.
