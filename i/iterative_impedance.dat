5000|$|<b>Iterative</b> <b>{{impedance}}</b> is {{the input}} impedance of one port of a two-port network {{when the other}} port is connected to an infinite chain of identical networks. [...] Equivalently, <b>iterative</b> <b>impedance</b> is that impedance that when connected to port 2 of a two-port network {{is equal to the}} impedance measured at port 1. This can be seen to be equivalent by considering the infinite chain of identical networks connected to port 2 in the first definition. If the original network is removed then port 1 of the second network will present the same <b>iterative</b> <b>impedance</b> as before since port 2 of the second network still has an infinite chain of networks connected to it. Thus the whole infinite chain can be replaced with a single lumped impedance equal to the <b>iterative</b> <b>impedance,</b> which is the condition for the second definition.|$|E

In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{application}} of learning impedance control scheme to exoskeleton arm driven by pneumatic artificial muscles (PAM), for assisting in the rehabilitation of {{patients who suffer from}} debilitating illness. An <b>iterative</b> learning <b>impedance</b> control problem for robotic manipulators is analyzed, proposed and solved. The target impedance reference modifies a desired trajectory according to the force signals and position signals of the joint. The desired control input of learning impedance control was estimated by radial basis function (RBF) neural network incorporated experience database. The curves of experiment result on the experimental setup show that the algorithm is successful also in the application of exoskeleton arm...|$|R

A new <b>iterative</b> learning <b>impedance</b> control (ITLC) algorithm was developed in the present study based on the physical recovery condition of impaired limbs to improve the performance of rehabilitation robots. The physical recovery condition elevation of impaired limbs was first evaluated in terms of periodic force and trajectory tracking ratio (TTR) parameters, and the desired impedance was then modified on line using the fuzzy method according to the change of physical recovery condition. Secondly, an adaptive impedance controller was designed and modified using the iterative learning method. The convergence was analyzed based upon the Lyapunov-like positive definite sequence, which was monotonically decreasing under the proposed control schemes. Finally, the simulation experiments were conducted to compare the proposed ITLC approach the traditional impedance control. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning impedance controller in rehabilitative training...|$|R
5000|$|For a {{symmetrical}} network, the <b>iterative</b> <b>impedance</b> {{and image}} impedance are identical {{and are the}} same at both ports. This impedance is sometimes called the network's characteristic impedance, a term usually reserved for transmission lines. [...] The model for a transmission line is an infinite chain of L-sections with infinitesimally small components. A transmission line characteristic impedance is thus the limiting case of a ladder network <b>iterative</b> <b>impedance.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Iterative</b> <b>impedance</b> is {{a similar}} concept to image impedance. Whereas an <b>iterative</b> <b>impedance</b> is formed by {{connecting}} port 2 of the first two-port network to port 1 of the next, an image impedance is formed by connecting port 2 of the first network to port 2 of the next. Port 1 of the second network is connected to port 1 of the third and so on, each subsequent network being reversed so that like ports always face each other.|$|E

40|$|We {{study in}} this work the {{processing}} of NaNbO 3 ceramics prepared in a single thermal treatment of highly reactive precursors obtained by mechanical activation of different reagents, aiming to determine optimum conditions for piezoelectric ceramics production. Pressure-less sintering at 1200 ºC leads to dense ceramics (< 5 % porosity) with poor mechanical stability, unsuitable for practical uses. Dense hot pressed ceramics were also obtained at lower temperatures (900 - 1100 ºC), {{all of them in}} the submicron range of average grain sizes (< 400 nm). Their microstructure was quantitatively characterised and their elastic and electromechanical properties determined by an automatic <b>iterative</b> method from <b>impedance</b> measurements at resonance. A noticeable ensemble of piezoelectric and elastic properties (d 33 = 38 pC. N- 1 and Np= 3252 kHz. mm) was measured for hot pressed ceramics, from precursors obtained by a combined route of wet-chemistry and mechanical activation, with a microstructure characterized by 0. 4 % residual porosity and a bimodal lognormal distribution of grain size...|$|R
40|$|The dielectric, {{piezoelectric}} and elastic coefficients, {{as well as}} the {{electromechanical coupling}} factors, of NaNbO 3 submicron-structured ceramics have been obtained by an automatic <b>iterative</b> method from <b>impedance</b> measurements at resonance. Poled thin disks were measured from room temperature up to the depoling one, close to 300 ºC. Dielectric thermal behaviour was determined also for unpoled ceramics up to the highest phase transition temperature. Ceramics were processed by hot-pressing from mechanically activated precursors. Microstructural effects on the properties are discussed. The suppression of the classical maximum in dielectric permittivity in unpoled ceramics at the phase transition at 370 ºC was found when a bimodal distribution of grain sizes, in which a population of average grain size of 110 nm in between much coarser grains is observed. The appearance of a phase transition at 150 ºC took place when Na vacancies are minimized. The occurrence of a non-centrosymmetric, ferroelectric phase, in the unpoled ceramic from room temperature to ~ 300 ºC, highly polarisable resulting in high ferro-piezoelectric properties was also observed in the ceramic which presents grain size below 160 nm. Maximum values of kp= 14 %, d 31 =- 8. 7 • 10 - 12 C•N- 1 and Np= 3772 Hz•m at room temperature, and kp= 18 %, d 31 =- 25. 4 • 10 - 12 C•N- 1 and Np= 3722 Hz•m at 295 ºC were achieved in the best processing conditions of the ceramics.
