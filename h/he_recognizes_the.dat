5|$|After tearfully reuniting {{with his}} son and new daughter-in-law, Walter discovers the device uses a unique {{radioactive}} signature that they can track. The strongest source points to a used campground, where Peter discovers a key. <b>He</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> key as from Walter's old home near Reiden Lake and travels there alone, and finds his biological father, Walternate, present. Walternate admits to being behind the End of Dayers group, as his revenge for Peter activating the doomsday device and destroying the parallel world that was his home. Walternate promises that Peter will face the same pain and suffering he has faced since crossing to the prime universe on a mission of mercy, one piece at a time. Peter realizes that Walternate is implying a threat to Olivia, and finds that Walternate was speaking to him remotely through a holographic simulation. In Central Park, where Moreau has set off another breach to expose an existing wormhole, Olivia is helping to cordon off the breach when Walternate approaches and shoots her. Peter {{and the rest of}} Fringe division struggle with her death at her funeral.|$|E
5|$|Alone with Shuu, Ryouta finally remembers {{what he had}} {{forgotten}} due to the traumatic nature of the events: <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> doctor {{as a man who}} promised to grant his wish for peace between birds and humans after he and the protagonist witnessed a human terrorist incident at a bird orphanage in which the protagonist's parents, crisis negotiators, were killed, and that the protagonist died when she visited him in the infirmary. It is revealed that she died by Charon virus after coming in contact with Ryouta, as Shuu had induced the virus into Ryouta's body though grafts from Nageki's remains for the purpose of using him to exterminate humanity—since there can be no more fighting between two factions if one is wiped out, this would grant Ryouta's wish. Shuu then remarks that Labor 9 was powered by the protagonist's now irreversibly damaged brain. A broken Ryouta submits to Shuu's offer of becoming a living weapon of mass destruction after these revelations, and a struggle ensues during which the protagonist's spirit intervenes. Ryouta then asks Shuu why he decided to grant his wish, to which it is implied that Shuu's affection towards Ryouta's deceased father, Ryuuji, was greater than Shuu himself would like to admit, and that he was motivated by Ryuuji's dying request: to do something for his son.|$|E

25|$|On May 2, Marshal Haftar {{met with}} Prime Minister Sarraj in Abu Dhabi, {{where they had}} a two-hour meeting, which was {{described}} as having made progress. During {{a press conference in}} Algiers, foreign minister Mohamed Taha Siala stated that the GNA will recognize Marshal Haftar as the supreme commander of the Libyan army if <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> GNA instead of the House of Representatives. This statement caused criticism in Tripoli.|$|E
25|$|Shortly thereafter, Jöns {{searches}} {{an abandoned}} village for water. He saves a mute servant girl (Gunnel Lindblom) from being raped {{by a man}} robbing a corpse. <b>He</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> man as Raval (Bertil Anderberg), a theologian, who ten years prior had convinced the knight to leave his wife and join a crusade to the Holy Land. The squire promises to brand the theologian on the face if they meet again. The servant girl joins the squire. The trio ride into town, where the actors met earlier are performing. Skat the actor-manager introduces the other actors to the crowd, then is enticed by Lisa (Inga Gill)—wife of the sentimental and violent blacksmith Plog—away for a tryst. They run off together. The actors' performance is interrupted {{by the arrival of}} a procession of flagellants.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> show {{is trying}} to define itself, and {{compared}} Peter's newfound leadership to The X-Files Fox Mulder, praised Acevedo's performance as [...] "evil Charlie," [...] but found some of Walter's mannerisms to be [...] "cheesy". SFScope writer Sarah Stegall lauded the premise of multiple universes, and called the episode's horror elements the reason she is now [...] "a devoted fan of this show". Stegall also praised Kirk Acevedo's performance {{as well as the}} parallels between Andrea Hughes and Walter; she concluded [...] "This may have been the best episode of this entire series, second perhaps to last season's finale, and certainly better than anything the anemic Grey's Anatomy or the aging CSI can offer".|$|E
500|$|Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) rescues Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) in {{the ocean}} as Boone fails to swim out to save a {{drowning}} woman, Joanna. Later, as Jack is approached by Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) as they question {{how to deal with}} the diminishing water supplies of the survivors, Boone confronts Jack regarding how he saved him and not Joanna, asking who made Jack their leader. Jack again sees the man who he saw in the previous episode, [...] "Walkabout", and runs off after him. Once Jack catches up, <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> man as his father, and the man runs away again. While chasing him, Jack trips and rolls down a mountain, just barely grabbing on to the edge of a cliff.|$|E

In a fit of rage, Peter accuses the others, saying they had a motive as he changed his will and left {{everything}} to the record. Oblivious {{to the fact that}} Lois, Chris and Meg have evidence to prove they did not take it he accuses them of conspiring to destroy his record, and suspects his kids for possible motives. He then furiously goes to the town's only record shop the next morning to buy another copy, but it turns out the stores had already been visited by [...] "a dog" [...] and [...] "a baby" [...] (Brian and Stewie) who bought all the copies. Peter is frustrated, but gets distracted as <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> record sales clerk to be Jesus Christ.|$|E

500|$|Rutherford's policy {{legacy is}} mixed. L. G. Thomas concludes {{that he was}} a weak leader, unable to {{dominate}} the ambitions of his lieutenants and with very little skill at debate. Despite this, <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> Rutherford government's legacy of province building. Douglas Babcock suggests that Rutherford, while himself honourable, left himself at the mercy of unscrupulous men who ultimately ruined his political career. Bennett, Rutherford's rival and later Prime Minister, concurred with this assessment, calling Rutherford [...] "a gentleman of the old school... not equipped by experience or temperament for the rough and tumble of western politics". There is general agreement that Rutherford's greatest legacy, and the one in which he took the most pride, lies in his contributions to Alberta's education. As Mount Royal College historian Patricia Roome concluded her chapter on Rutherford in a book about Alberta's first twelve premiers, [...] "Rutherford's educational contribution remains his ultimate legacy to Albertans." ...|$|E
500|$|Ron {{speaks in}} a deadpan tone of voice and seldom expresses any kind of emotion, {{although}} he is often shown to be very giddy {{when it comes to}} riddles and meat. He adheres to many stereotypically masculine traits. He claims to have only cried twice: once when he was hit by a bus at age 7; secondly when miniature horse Li'l Sebastian died. Ron is an outdoor enthusiast who loves hunting, fishing, camping, and woodworking. For years, Ron has used a park ranger station in the woods as a lodge for private hunting trips with his male colleagues at city hall. He describes fishing as [...] "like yoga, except I still get to kill something." [...] He is particularly attracted to brunettes and what he describes as [...] "strong, self-possessed women {{at the top of their}} fields," [...] with professional athletes Steffi Graf and Sheryl Swoopes among his ideal women. He loves breakfast foods and red meats; among the types of food he enjoys are bacon-wrapped shrimp, fried turkey legs inside a grilled hamburger, and bacon-wrapped turkey legs, which are known in Pawnee as [...] "The Swanson." [...] He also drinks heavily but seldom feels the effects of alcohol or gets hung over. He primarily drinks scotch whisky, claiming that [...] "Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets." [...] He is an extremely private person, going so far as to redact his birthday from government documents to keep others from holding parties for him (though he did reluctantly provide it as [...] "springtime" [...] on a hospital admission form). Ron knows almost nothing about popular culture; <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> name Julia Roberts only as the [...] "toothy gal from Mystic Pizza," [...] and he once confused the Star Wars film franchise with Harry Potter. He enjoys the music of Willie Nelson, being shown listening to [...] "Hello Walls" [...] and [...] "Buddy" [...] during the series. Ron is extremely concerned with the image people have of him and once refused to seek treatment for a hernia; he instead chose to remain immobile at his desk all day and night until April offered to take him to the hospital.|$|E
2500|$|In Heraclitus a {{perceived}} object is a harmony between two fundamental units of change, a waxing and a waning.

It is undoubtedly due to that impartiality that Jost's work suffered by comparison with the warm Jewish spirit which permeates Grätz's work (see Grätz, [...] "Gesch." [...] xi. 456).|$|E
2500|$|The {{second phase}} of Einstein's [...] "debate" [...] with Bohr and the {{orthodox}} interpretation is characterized by an acceptance {{of the fact that}} it is, as a practical matter, impossible to simultaneously determine the values of certain incompatible quantities, but the rejection that this implies that these quantities do not actually have precise values. Einstein rejects the probabilistic interpretation of Born and insists that quantum probabilities are epistemic and not ontological in nature. As a consequence, the theory must be incomplete in some way. [...] <b>He</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> great value of the theory, but suggests that it [...] "does not tell the whole story", and, while providing an appropriate description at a certain level, it gives no information on the more fundamental underlying level: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the prologue}} of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Jones {{is seen as}} a teenager, {{establishing}} his look when given a fedora hat. Indiana's intentions are revealed as prosocial, as he believes artifacts [...] "belong in a museum." [...] In the film's climax, Indiana undergoes [...] "literal" [...] tests of faith to retrieve the Grail and save his father's life. He also remembers Jesus as a historical figure – a humble carpenter – rather than an exalted figure when <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> simple nature and tarnished appearance of the real Grail amongst a large assortment of much more ornately decorated ones. Henry Senior rescues his son from falling to his death when reaching for the fallen Grail, telling him to [...] "let it go," [...] overcoming his mercenary nature. The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles explains how Indiana becomes solitary and less idealistic following his service in World War I. In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Jones is older and wiser, whereas his sidekicks Mutt and Mac are youthfully arrogant and greedy, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|The regular G.I. {{was also}} a target of {{animation}} and many films directed toward him explicitly instructed him on how to behave. [...] Those in the Army and Marine Corps {{were familiar with the}} names Private Snafu and Lance Corporal Schmuckatelli. [...] These fictional characters gave soldiers safety briefs. [...] One film titled Snafuperman depicts a G.I., Private Snafu, who disdains studying and reading. [...] He is given special powers but uses them to the almost detriment of the United States because he did not study and know the difference between his own side and the enemy. [...] At the conclusion of the film, <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> need for an education. [...] The appropriately titled film Booby Traps uses Private Snafu to show the dangers and the caution needed to be taken in the case of such malicious devices. Spies once again portrays Private Snafu acting counter to what he has been told. [...] The intoxicated G.I. gives secrets to a beautiful woman who is really a Nazi spy. [...] Through the information he gives her, the Germans are able to bomb the ship Private Snafu is traveling on, sending him to hell.|$|E
2500|$|Nietzsche {{asserted}} that the psychological reality of redemption was [...] "... new way of life, not a new faith." [...] It is [...] "...he deep instinct for how one must live, in order to feel oneself 'in heaven'...." [...] The Christian is known by his acts. He offers no resistance to evil, He has no anger and wants no revenge. Blessedness is not promised on conditions, as in Judaism. The Gospel's glad tidings are {{that there is no}} distinction between God and man. There is no Judaic concern for sin, prayers, rituals, forgiveness, repentance, guilt, punishment, or faith. [...] "vangelic practice alone leads to God, it is God!" [...] "t is only in the practice of life that one feels 'divine,' 'blessed,' 'evangelical,' at all times a 'child of God.'" [...] There were two worlds for the teacher of the Gospel's glad tidings. The real, true world is an inner experience of the heart in which all things are blessedly transfigured (Verklärung), eternalized, and perfected. The apparent world, however, is only a collection of psychological symbols, signs, and metaphors. These symbols are expressed in terms of space, time, history, and nature. Examples of these mere symbols are the concepts of [...] "God as a person", [...] "the son of man", [...] "the hour of death", and [...] "the kingdom of heaven". Jesus did not want to redeem anyone. He wanted to show how to live. His legacy was his bearing and behavior. He did not resist evildoers. He loved evildoers. Nietzsche has Jesus tell the thief on the cross that he is in Paradise now if <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> divinity of Jesus' comportment.|$|E

David pries Hook away, saying that Arthur was right, he doesn't remember anything from the events in Camelot, and the now, Arthur was [...] "no longer important." [...] Hook says Emma told them this was about him, but Regina says that Emma is manipulating him, like all the Dark Ones do, and Regina and Mary Margaret are convinced that Emma has fully succumbed to the darkness. Hook believes Emma hasn't fully caved to the darkness yet, since she hasn't used the sword yet, but Regina thinks Emma still needs another ingredient for her spell. Hook is determined {{to find out what}} went on in Camelot, saying {{that the only way to}} help her is to find out what happened between him and Emma. Hook visits Gold at his shop, and Mr. Gold tells Belle to put down the crossbow, since Hook wasn't Emma. Mr. Gold says he had some squid ink set aside, but the new Dark One took it. Hook says that Dark Ones are clever, being able to convince everyone that they've really changed when they haven't, and then asks what’s going on inside Emma’s head. He tells Gold what Emma said about her actions being about him. Gold says <b>he</b> <b>recognizes</b> <b>the</b> look on her face – regret. He says he became the Dark One to save his son. He adds that he convinced himself everything he did was for that, and that once he saved his son, he would atone for his sins, but things did not work out. He tells Hook to find out what Emma is trying to atone for to get the answers. Hook says he can’t find her, and Gold says that he will have to give her a reason to find him. Hook goes outside and calls for Emma and asks what happened between them and what she wants.|$|E
