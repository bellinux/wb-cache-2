5|$|Before {{developing}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{worked as}} a literature professor for the University of Chicago, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and DePauw University. He also delved into fiction writing, having developed a fascination for it {{as a graduate student}} at the University of Arkansas. His first published work was the short story collection Between <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Yellow Sea, released in 2006. The author published his debut novel, titled Galveston, four years later, and around the same time began preparing to branch out into the television industry (earlier attempts were never realized due to lack of capital).|$|E
5|$|Many {{populations of}} moorland birds, {{including}} {{the black and}} red grouse live <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> country has internationally significant nesting grounds for seabirds such as the northern gannet. The golden eagle has become a national icon, and white-tailed eagles and ospreys have recently re-colonised the land. The Scottish crossbill is the only endemic vertebrate species in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Richard William Wright (28 July 1943– 15 September 2008) was an English musician, composer, singer, and songwriter. He was {{a founder}} member, keyboardist, and vocalist of the {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, performing on {{all but one of}} the group's albums including The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Division Bell, and playing on all of their tours.|$|E

5|$|The {{discussion}} {{which has}} taken place <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> consideration which {{has been given to}} the facts alleged, most conclusively show {{that this is not a}} case that can admit of no denial or proof to the contrary; under these circumstances, however obnoxious I am myself to the trial by battle, it is the mode of trial which we, in our judicial character, are bound to award. We are delivering the law as it is, and not as we wish it to be, and therefore we must pronounce our judgment, that the battle must take place.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of NY18's routing {{south of the}} village of Lewiston was incorporated into the U.S. Highway System in the early 1930s after US62 and US219 were extended into New York and US104 was assigned. NY18 now began concurrent to US219 at the state line and overlapped the route northward {{to the city of}} Salamanca. US219 left NY18 <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> latter continued independently to the town of Dayton, where it intersected US62. From there, US62 followed NY18 north to a junction with US104 (Main Street) in Niagara Falls. US62 ended here, and NY18 became concurrent to US104 upon turning onto Main Street. The overlap ended in the village of Lewiston, where US104 turned east to follow Ridge Road instead.|$|E

5|$|The more populous {{northern}} part of the country, comprising about 30% of the country's total area, is called the Swiss Plateau. It has greater open and hilly landscapes, partly forested, partly open pastures, usually with grazing herds, or vegetables and fruit fields, but it is still hilly. There are large lakes found <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> biggest Swiss cities are in this area of the country.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continues}} north {{through the}} towns of Greene and Smithville to the hamlet of Smithville Flats, where it meets the western terminus of NY220. NY41 heads northwest from this junction, passing by Long Pond and Cincinnatus Lake before crossing into Cortland County {{and the town of}} Willet. In the hamlet of the same name, NY41 intersects NY26. It joins NY41 <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two routes proceed northwest from the hamlet and across the Otselic River to a junction with the east end of NY221. Past this point, NY26 and NY41 head due north along the river's west bank into the town of Cincinnatus.|$|E
5|$|At the intersection, Routes957 and958 become {{concurrent}} along a westbound residential street, until leaving Lottsville, {{where the}} two routes turn to the southwest in fields. As Routes 957 and958 approach a railroad line used by Norfolk Southern (and previously the Erie Railroad), Route958 forks to the north, paralleling and soon crossing the rails northwest of Lottsville. The distinctively rural surroundings for Route958 return, and the Norfolk Southern line parallels to the east as the highway curves northwestward. Soon, Route958 returns to a farming region and curves away from the railroad on a mountainside. After passing a large pond, the route intersects Greeley Street a t-intersection in Bear Lake, where Route958 turns eastward through the rural areas before intersecting with North Road, where the route turns northward and reaches the New York state line near Niobe, New York. Route958 terminates <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> right-of-way continues northward as Chautauqua County Route33 (PanamaBear Lake Road).|$|E

5|$|Bathymetry is {{the mapping}} and {{study of the}} {{topography}} of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring {{the depth of the}} sea include single or multibeam echosounders, laser airborne depth sounders and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries. The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle, and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper and mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. The crust below land is known as continental while that under the abyssal sea is called oceanic. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometers (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates. In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in jerks which cause earthquakes. Heat is also produced and magma is forced up, creating underwater mountains, some of which grow into volcanic islands. Near some boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{had taught}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DePauw University, and the University of Chicago. Inspired by HBO's series The Wire, The Sopranos, and Deadwood, he began working on a short story collection that he later published as Between <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Yellow Sea in 2006. He published a novel, Galveston, in 2010, and began trying to write for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful {{because of a lack}} of money. Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for AMC's series The Killing. He credits the show with giving him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season.|$|E
5|$|The {{site has}} been {{politically}} important {{since the early}} 18th century, when King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710) divided the Kingdom of Imerina into four quadrants and assigned his son Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana to govern the northeastern quadrant, Avaradrano, from its newly designated capital at Ambohimanga. The division of Imerina led to 77 years of civil war, during which time the successive rulers of Avaradrano led military campaigns to expand their territory while undertaking modifications to the defenses at Ambohimanga to better protect it against attacks. The war was ended from Ambohimanga by King Andrianampoinimerina, who successfully undertook negotiations and military campaigns that reunited Imerina under his rule by 1793. Upon capturing the historic capital of Imerina at Antananarivo, Andrianampoinimerina shifted his royal court and all political functions back to its original locus at Antananarivo's royal compound and declared the two cities of equal importance, with Ambohimanga as the kingdom's spiritual capital. He and later rulers in his line continued to conduct royal rituals at the site and regularly inhabited and remodeled Ambohimanga until French colonization of the kingdom and the exile {{of the royal family}} in 1897. The significance of historical events <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> presence of royal tombs have given the hill a sacred character that is further enhanced at Ambohimanga by the burial sites of several Vazimba, the island's earliest inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} the forest in the Wind River Range is the primary destination for mountain climbers. Nine of the highest 10 peaks in Wyoming are <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mountains are primarily of granitic rock with countless cliffs and sheer rock walls. The Cirque of the Towers is particularly popular as it has numerous peaks within a relatively short distance of each other. Two particular climbs on the peaks in the cirque are considered amongst the finest climbing adventures available in the U.S. The Absaroka Range also attracts climbers but not of a technical nature since the rocks are not considered solid enough for good anchoring points. For the tallest peaks in the Wind River Range, the entire summiting effort will take even experienced climbers many days due to the inaccessibility {{of the region and}} complexity of the climbing effort.|$|E
