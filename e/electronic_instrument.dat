5|$|The {{electronic}} organ developed throughout the 20th century. Some pipe organs {{were replaced by}} digital organs because of their lower purchase price, smaller physical size, and minimal maintenance requirements. In the early 1970s, Rodgers Instruments pioneered the hybrid organ, an <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument</b> that incorporates real pipes; other builders such as Allen Organs and Johannus Orgelbouw have since built hybrid organs.|$|E
5|$|The A330 {{shares the}} same glass cockpit flight deck layout as the A320 and A340, {{featuring}} <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument</b> displays rather than mechanical gauges. Instead {{of a conventional}} control yoke, the flight deck features side-stick controls, six main displays, and the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which covers navigation and flight displays, {{as well as the}} Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM). Apart from the flight deck, the A330 also has the fly-by-wire system common to the A320 family, the A340, the A350, and the A380. It also features three primary and two secondary flight control systems, as well as a flight envelope limit protection system which prevents manoeuvres from exceeding the aircraft's aerodynamic and structural limits.|$|E
5|$|The {{electronic}} music of Kid A and Amnesiac {{was inspired by}} Yorke's admiration for {{electronic music}} exemplified by Warp Records artists such as Aphex Twin; in 2013, Yorke named Aphex Twin as his biggest influence. The album also samples early computer music. The jazz of Charles Mingus, Alice Coltrane and Miles Davis, and 1970s krautrock bands such as Can and Neu!, were other major influences during this period. Jonny Greenwood's interest in 20th century classical music also had a role, as the influence of composers Krzysztof Penderecki and Olivier Messiaen was apparent; since the recording of Kid A, Greenwood has played the ondes Martenot, an early <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument</b> popularised by Messiaen.|$|E
5000|$|Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft (...) or D.A.F. is an {{influential}} German electropunk/Neue Deutsche Welle band from Düsseldorf, formed in 1978 featuring Gabriel [...] "Gabi" [...] Delgado-López (vocals), Robert Görl (drums, percussion, <b>electronic</b> <b>instruments),</b> Kurt [...] "Pyrolator" [...] Dahlke (<b>electronic</b> <b>instruments),</b> Michael Kemner (bass-guitar) and Wolfgang Spelmans (guitar). Kurt Dahlke {{was replaced by}} Chrislo Haas (<b>electronic</b> <b>instruments,</b> bass guitar, saxophone) in 1979. Since 1981, the band has consisted of Delgado-López and Görl.|$|R

25|$|The 717 {{features}} a two-crew cockpit that incorporates six interchangeable liquid-crystal-display units and advanced Honeywell VIA 2000 computers. The cockpit design is called Advanced Common Flightdeck (ACF) and is {{shared with the}} MD-10 and MD-11. Flight deck features include an <b>Electronic</b> <b>Instrument</b> System, a dual Flight Management System, a Central Fault Display System, and Global Positioning System. Category IIIb automatic landing capability for bad-weather operations and Future Air Navigation Systems are available. The 717 shares the same type rating as the DC-9, such that the FAA approved transition courses for DC-9 and analog MD-80 pilots that could be completed in 11 days.|$|E
25|$|Radiohead {{began work}} on Kid A in Paris in January 1999 with OK Computer {{producer}} Nigel Godrich and no deadline. Yorke, who had the greatest control in the band, was still facing writer's block. His new songs were incomplete, and some consisted of little more than sounds or drum machine rhythms; few had clear verses or choruses. Instead of working as a traditional rock band, Radiohead experimented with electronic instruments including modular synthesisers and the ondes Martenot, an early theremin-like <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument.</b> Godrich and the band used software such as Pro Tools and Cubase to edit and manipulate their recordings.|$|E
25|$|A {{synthesizer}} is an <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument</b> {{capable of}} producing sounds by generating electrical signals of different frequencies. These electrical signals are played through a loudspeaker or set of headphones. Synthesizers can usually produce {{a wide range of}} sounds, which may either imitate other instruments ("imitative synthesis") or generate new timbres. The first electric synthesizer was invented in 1876 by Elisha Gray who accidentally discovered that he could control sound from a self vibrating electromagnetic circuit and in doing so, invented a basic single note oscillator. This musical telegraph used steel reeds whose oscillations were created and transmitted, over a telephone line, by electromagnets. Gray also built a simple loudspeaker device in later models consisting of a vibrating diaphragm in a magnetic field to make the oscillator audible.|$|E

25|$|Boulez earned {{money by}} giving {{mathematics}} lessons to his landlord's son. He also played the ondes Martenot (an early <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument),</b> improvising accompaniments to radio dramas and occasionally deputising {{in the pit}} orchestra of the Folies Bergère. In early 1946 the actor and director Jean-Louis Barrault needed someone to play the instrument for a production of Hamlet for the new company he and his wife, Madeleine Renaud, had formed. Honegger suggested Boulez. He was soon appointed Music Director of the Compagnie Renaud-Barrault, a post he held for nine years. He arranged and conducted incidental music, mostly by composers {{with whom he had}} little affinity (such as Milhaud and Tchaikovsky), but it gave him the chance to work with professional musicians, whilst leaving him time to compose during the day. It also broadened his horizons: in 1947 the company toured to Belgium and Switzerland ("absolutely pays de cocagne , my first discovery of the big world"); in 1948 they took their production of Hamlet to the second Edinburgh International Festival; in 1951 they gave a season of plays at St James's Theatre in London at the invitation of Laurence Olivier; and between 1950 and 1957 there were three tours to South America and two to North America. The music he wrote for the company was lost during the student occupation of the Théâtre de l'Odéon in 1968.|$|E
500|$|Most {{electronic}} {{elements were}} not overdubbed but recorded {{live in the}} studio. Greenwood used the music programming language Max to sample and manipulate the band's playing in real time, and continued to use modular synthesisers and the ondes Martenot, an early theremin-like <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument</b> he had first used on Kid A. After using effects pedals heavily on previous albums, he mostly used clean guitar sounds {{to see if he}} could [...] "come up with interesting things" [...] without effects.|$|E
500|$|The Leslie {{speaker is}} a {{combined}} amplifier and loudspeaker that projects the signal from an electric or <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument</b> and modifies the sound by rotating the loudspeakers. It is most {{commonly associated with}} the Hammond organ, though it was later used for the guitar and other instruments. A typical Leslie speaker contains an amplifier, a treble horn and a bass speaker—though specific components depend upon the model. A musician controls the Leslie speaker by either an external switch or pedal that alternates between a slow and fast speed setting, known as [...] "chorale" [...] and [...] "tremolo".|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to a commission for a piece to accompany light-and-water shows on the Seine during the Paris Exposition, in 1937 Messiaen demonstrated his interest in using the ondes Martenot, an <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument,</b> by composing Fêtes des belles eaux for an ensemble of six. He included a part for the instrument in several of his subsequent compositions. During this period he composed several multi-movement organ works. He arranged his orchestral suite L'ascension ("The Ascension") for organ, replacing the orchestral version's third movement with an entirely new movement, Transports de joie d'une âme devant la gloire du Christ qui est la sienne ("Ecstasies of a soul before the glory of Christ which is the soul's own") (...) [...] He also wrote the extensive cycles La Nativité du Seigneur ("The Nativity of the Lord") and Les corps glorieux ("The glorious bodies").|$|E
500|$|Much of the {{recording}} equipment used to create the movie's intricately complicated sound effects was, at the time, extremely cutting edge. Among these pieces of equipment was the ADS (Advanced Digital Synthesizer) 11, manufactured by Pasadena, California custom synthesizer manufacturer Con Brio, Inc. The movie provided major publicity and was used to advertise the synthesizer, though no price was given. The film's soundtrack also provided a debut for the Blaster Beam, an <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument</b> [...] long. It was created by musician Craig Huxley, who played a small role in an episode of the original television series. The Blaster had steel wires connected to amplifiers fitted to the main piece of aluminum; the device was played with an artillery shell. Goldsmith heard it and immediately decided {{to use it for}} V'Ger's cues. Several state-of-the-art synthesizers were used as musical instruments, notably the Yamaha CS-80, ARP 2600, Oberheim OB-X, and Serge synthesizer. An enormous pipe organ first plays the V'Ger theme on the Enterprises approach, a literal indication of the machine's power.|$|E
500|$|Films such as Star Wars, Alien, Blade Runner, , and Starship Troopers were {{significant}} {{influences on the}} atmosphere and artistic qualities of the game. The team chose Jack Wall, who also penned the music for BioWare's 2005 title Jade Empire, as the main composer of Mass Effect due to his ability to produce {{a wide range of}} musical styles. Hudson had a clear idea of what kind of music he wanted in the game, but gave Wall certain artistic freedom to express himself. According to Wall, the main vision was to [...] "marry the <b>electronic</b> <b>instrument</b> palatte [...] of the late 70's/early 80's with more organic elements." [...] Wall had never written this style of music before, but composer Sam Hulick helped him develop the electronic sound on a classic orchestral foundation. By the end of the project, composers Richard Jacques and David Kates joined Wall and Hulick to finish the score on time. While a total of 110 minutes of music was written for the game, all in-game and cinematic music was crafted as multiple stems to maximize their use and variety. The game went gold on October 22, 2007.|$|E
