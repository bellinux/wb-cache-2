25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> anybody I wanted to direct. At {{the same time}} I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
500|$|Sony {{received}} {{criticism for}} canceling the wide release. Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw wrote {{that it was}} an [...] "unprecedented defeat on American turf", but that [...] "North Korea will find that their bullying edict will haunt them." [...] In the Capital and Gizmodo suggested the cancellation caused a Streisand effect, whereby the attempt to remove or censor a work has the unintended consequence of publicizing it more widely. In a press conference, U.S. President Barack Obama said that though he was sympathetic to Sony's need to protect employees, he thought Sony had [...] "made a mistake. We cannot have a society in which some dictator in some place can start imposing censorship in the United States. I wish they'd spoken to me first. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> them: do not get into the pattern in which you are intimidated." ...|$|E
60|$|Jud. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you so, if I {{could have}} spoken for fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, papa, I did {{not mean}} to {{distress}} you. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you if I had remembered--but I am worried to-day, and off my guard--" ...|$|R
5000|$|He replied: [...] "I'm {{waiting to}} get my white envelope, so I expect so. I'm sure <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>told</b> if my {{services}} weren't required {{for the next two}} scheduled programs of 7.30 New South Wales." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} girl, with her unsparing honesty, [...] "if you {{had given me}} any hint, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> for the world. Of course I did not think--a girl wouldn't--of the effect it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> on the property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I did not {{recollect}} {{you had the}} gray, or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you to take my horse. However, there's no harm done, and {{it saved}} time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{could have}} found you <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you that I should be here all the morning. I might have sent you a message, only--only I didn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing, my {{lord and}} love," [...] {{answered}} the Countess faintly; [...] "something {{there was that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you, but your anger has driven it from my recollection." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I daren't--I tried," [...] and {{the girl}} quivered in Miss Schuyler's grasp. [...] "If I could <b>have</b> warned him <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you; but Joe saw me, and I was afraid. I told him to come at nine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!--I {{swear to}} you, Julie, no! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him anything, but I was wild, crazy. And {{he was a}} brute, a great bear. He held me fast, here, so! I could not move. It was a forced confession. Yes--Mother of God--by force!" ...|$|R
60|$|This story <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told,</b> {{but that}} {{my whole life}} turned upon these accursed boots. I walked back to school as proud as a peacock, and easily succeeded in {{satisfying}} the boys as to {{the manner in which}} I came by my new ornaments.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Easily enough,' he answered. 'Now, if you {{had taken}} me into your confidence, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you that I {{consider}} Miss Temple too tall a woman for my fancy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never made}} it a secret; I had no reason for so doing. If you had asked me who Henry's tutor was, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you. Besides, I thought you knew." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What of that?" [...] said Rovinski. [...] "I {{would have}} sent my message; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> how the north pole was found. The glory and the honor would have been mine." ...|$|E
5000|$|... if that weren’t the case, <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> {{you that}} I’m going {{to prepare a}} place for you? (e.g. English Standard Version (ESV)) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My wench takes {{after her}} good mother," [...] said John, [...] "and I ever found my secrets were safer in her breast than in mine own. Not that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> her <b>told</b> without need. But she might take little Rusha there, or make the place known to others an she be not warned." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{heard the}} crew washing decks above me. <b>I</b> knew <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been <b>told</b> at once {{if there had}} been any wind. Calm, I thought, and I was doubly vexed. Indeed, I felt dual more than ever. The steward reappeared {{suddenly}} in the doorway. I jumped up from the couch so quickly that he gave a start.|$|R
60|$|He {{knew it was}} {{the mark}} of tears as well as I. But if he had asked the {{question}} twenty times, each time with twenty blows, I believe my baby heart would have burst before <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him so.|$|E
60|$|Oakhurst (rising swiftly). No, no: it is false! Ah! She's gone. Another moment, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> her all. Pshaw! courage, man! It is {{only six}} days more, {{and you are}} free, and this year's shame and agony forever ended.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me {{out when}} he came back before he went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know what you were planning, for <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you that your pains were wasted." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Colonel {{held his}} head between his hands, and {{answered}} very slowly, {{as if the}} words were wrung from him by torture: [...] "If you hadn't yourself asked me the question point-blank, Harry, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you anything about it. Yes, my boy, my dear boy, my poor boy; I know it all ... all ... all ... absolutely." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Paul, most like, {{understanding}} that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the story <b>told</b> {{in a manner}} favorable to myself, gave a hurried account of our adventures from that time until we learned of the scout's trouble.|$|R
60|$|Not {{for so much}} again <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> her of Mr. Manners's conduct. So I stood confused, casting {{about for}} a reply with truth in it, when Comyn broke in upon us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye, so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> 'Maso on the spot, had the obstinate old fellow been {{inclined}} to hear me. The distance {{is just about}} what you say; and nothing is easier than {{to see that the}} stranger is a lugger. As to the nation--" ...|$|E
60|$|Need I {{tell you}} that I would have had my tongue torn out before <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him such things had I not a greater end in view? I would let him know all if I could but save the army of Clausel.|$|E
60|$|LORD DARLINGTON. I couldn't! A man can't {{tell these}} things about another man! But if I had {{known he was}} going to make you ask her here to-night, I think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you. That insult, at any rate, you would have been spared.|$|E
6000|$|... "If Hurry knows {{anything}} of father's history, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> he <b>had</b> <b>told</b> it to me!" [...] she cried. [...] "Sometimes I think, too, {{he was once}} a sailor, and then again I think he was not. If that chest were open, or if it could speak, it might let us into his whole history. But its fastenings are too strong to be broken like pack thread." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God! And I thank you, sir! Oh, there's never a storm {{but what}} some gleam breaks through it! And now, sir, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you it before, lest you should fancy that I {{changed for the}} sake of gain-- though, perhaps, that is pride, as too much else has been. But you will never hear of me inside either of those chapels again." ...|$|R
60|$|It is not {{on account}} of his chivalry that I love him--no, it is not that. He told on me, but I do not blame him; it is a {{peculiarity}} of sex, I think, and he did not make his sex. Of course <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> on him, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> perished first; but that is a peculiarity of sex, too, and I do not take credit for it, for I did not make my sex.|$|R
6000|$|For, by {{authority}} of Mr. Garrett, {{one knows that}} Jameson's 600 were only 530 at most, when you count out his native drivers, etc.; and that the 530 consisted largely of [...] "green" [...] youths, [...] "raw young fellows," [...] not trained and war-worn British soldiers; and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> Jameson that those lads {{would not be able}} to shoot effectively from horseback in the scamper and racket of battle, and that there would not be anything for them to shoot at, anyway, but rocks; for the Boers would be behind the rocks, not out in the open. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him that 300 Boer sharpshooters behind rocks would be an overmatch for his 500 raw young fellows on horseback.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you would}} have let me speak to you before, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you that I come as a friend,' replied the cat; 'and I shall be greatly obliged if you would send four of the strongest and cunningest among you, to do me a service.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} told him so in an instant, if I had made up my mind. Do you think I would wish {{to keep him in}} {{suspense}} on such a matter? If I could have felt that I could love him as his wife, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him so instantly,--instantly." ...|$|E
5000|$|We told each other, that we {{were the}} wildest, the wildest things we'd ever seen ...The lyric turns to deeper emotions, which Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh {{characterized}} as [...] "lines that mingle love, grief, and rancor", with the chorus summing::Now <b>I</b> wished you <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> me — ...|$|R
5000|$|Whether I re-entered that unhappy {{country or}} not was of little {{consequence}} to me. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to <b>have</b> <b>told</b> {{them that the}} sooner I was rid of that hate-beleaguered atmosphere the better, that I was fed up of America's insults and moral pomposity...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} ask why I tell you so now, Master Julian," [...] said Dame Deborah; [...] "for, I promise you, {{it is against}} her express commands; and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you, <b>had</b> you not looked so pitiful;--but as for seeing you, that she will not--and she is in her own bedroom, with a good oak door shut and bolted upon her--that is one comfort.--And so, as for any breach of trust on my part--I promise you the little saucy minx gives it no less name--it is quite impossible." ...|$|R
