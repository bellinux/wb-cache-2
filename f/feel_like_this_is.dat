The single's official cover art {{was released on}} October 21, showing Gaga's backside, wearing a floral thong. The cover art was shot by photographer Terry Richardson. In an interview with German television station ProSieben, Gaga explained that the explicit imagery for the cover art {{was due to the}} constant criticism and discussion surrounding her, adding that [...] "When I look at how society has changed, I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a good time to show you my ass, because it's all I choose to give you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schwahn made Lucas and Peyton's {{love affair}} a {{central theme of}} the show, saying he [...] "designed a world where Peyton and Lucas {{were meant to be}} together" [...] and that [...] "the seeds were planted for [...] to pick Peyton in the pilot– in [...] first episode... When Lucas is at the Rivercourt {{at the end of that}} pilot, you know. I think we <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the girl [...] is his soulmate.

2500|$|Although most reviews were favorable, Mama's Gun {{was not as}} {{successful}} with consumers and critics as Baduizm had been; Q wrote that Badu's debut had raised expectations she did not meet on Mama's Gun, while Entertainment Weekly said it was plagued by [...] "a reactionary pseudo-sophistication that too often substitutes good taste for good tunes." [...] According to Badu in an interview {{a few months after}} the album's release, [...] "it has sold 1.4 million in the US. So no, it didn't sell as much ... although creatively I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a better piece of work." [...] She felt disappointed at first about its commercial performance, but was encouraged by the response from listeners at her concerts: [...] "When I started to tour again and saw all the people show up who knew the words, it was confirmation that the work is not always for commercial success. It's also for spiritual upliftment." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} to favourable reviews, with Creosote noting, [...] "It <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the beginning of}} something. And to feel that so far down the line, after putting out forty effing albums... oh my God! It means, I can still do this, it's not over." ...|$|R
5000|$|He further {{expanded}} {{that the}} album's emphasis {{would be on}} [...] "heavy guitars" [...] and [...] "loud drums", but not [...] "...a lot of percussion {{in the background and}} keyboard parts and tons of strings in different places. There's a time and place for all those things, but I didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> that time or place." ...|$|R
5000|$|Yet again, White is {{disappointed}} in another {{simply because he}} says, [...] "nothing interesting or exciting happened" [...] during this fight. White also says, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the season where guys just don't want it!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In Billboards November 17, 2011 album announcement, Wennerstrom explained: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the strongest}} record Ive ever done. I feel like playing with these guys, us all being so connected, really helped {{make it so}} fully realized. Im really, really happy with it".|$|E
5000|$|Christine Horton of Den of Geek wrote, [...] "Ultimately, 'Blind Love' {{is a bit}} of a {{throwaway}} episode, and if {{you miss}} it, it won't make any difference to the rest of the season. But you can't help but <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> one final hurrah before things take a much darker turn for the remainder of the season." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2011, Anderson {{attended}} the SxSW Music Festival {{and played a}} number of shows, two of which featured fellow Scottish attendees Kid Canaveral as his backing band. The same year, Anderson released Diamond Mine, a collaborative album with electronica composer Jon Hopkins, to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the Mercury Prize, with Anderson stating, [...] "It <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the beginning of something. And to feel that so far down the line, after putting out forty effing albums, oh my God! It means, I can still do this, it's not over." [...] The duo subsequently released an EP, Honest Words.|$|R

5000|$|Describing the moment, {{she said}} that she “immediately called my friend back 10 seconds after {{receiving}} her message and accepted the offer. We did not talk about the (pay).” Noting the importance of the case, {{she said that}} “At a time when the nation is still grieving, I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> my way of getting involved,” and “I thought this is my own way of giving public service, especially when media can’t be there.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Love It When I <b>Feel</b> <b>Like</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> {{the debut}} album by baggy-influenced band The Twang, which was {{released}} in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2007 through B-Unique Records.

5000|$|After Ego Death, {{the members}} of The Internet decided that they would venture on solo {{projects}} to flesh out their individual styles. When speaking about what the album would entail, Syd stated:"This album is not that deep, but I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> my descent into the depth I want the band to get to...For me, this is like an in-between thing — maybe get a song on the radio, maybe make some money, have some new shit to perform." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman cites [...] "Best Laid Plans" [...] "is {{one of the}} better Once Upon A Time episodes to engage with this theme in some time. So, for that reason, I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> episode <b>is</b> well worth {{checking}} out." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jackman did, however, {{state that}} {{he would be willing to}} keep playing Wolverine had the {{character}} been brought into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, presumably in a deal akin to that Marvel Studios made with Sony to utilize the character of Spider-Man. Jackman elaborated, [...] "If that was on the table when I made my decision, it certainly would have made me pause. That's for sure. Because I always love the idea of him within that dynamic, with the Hulk obviously, with Iron Man but there's a lot of smarter people with MBAs who can't figure that out. You never know. At the moment, honestly, if I really did have them there, I probably wouldn't have said <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the last. It just <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the right time leave the character." ...|$|R
5000|$|Throughout her {{marriage}} to Bill Spencer, Jr. (Don Diamont), the couple have endured multiple challenges, including all of Bill's plotting to kill someone. Tom said [...] "even though Katie 'left him' at one point, she never walked out on him in the regard where she's not trying to come back; trying to find her way back." [...] Describing her as the girl who doesn't cut and run, additionally stating [...] "It would take a lot for her {{to walk away from}} this relationship - she <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the man she loves, she understands who she's married to - she knows she didn't marry a boy scout." [...] Katie is someone to [...] "correct" [...] Bill and [...] "love" [...] him through his wrongdoing, according to the actress.|$|R
5000|$|She {{explained}} further, [...] "I am a {{voice for}} women who feel like they're alone in these situations. This project came from an emotion, and that's what I {{want it to be}} about - not what I look like or who I'm with, but the raw emotion and support for women." [...] To NPR she added, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the era of the anti-star. I really just wanted it to be about the music, and get away from, 'Who is she with?' and 'What is she wearing?'" ...|$|E

5000|$|After {{the release}} of her 2001 album Irresistible, Simpson stated she wanted to write songs for her third record. In an {{interview}} by MTV in October 2002, Lachey, her then husband, revealed that she {{is back in the}} studio, working on a new record. He said [...] "she's finally writing her own music, which I've told her she could do forever but she's been shy about stepping out there and doing it. But she's an incredible writer, and she's doing stuff that's really from the heart". About the album's sound, he said [...] "It's a much more organic record and it's more true to herself", he continued saying [...] "There's all live instrumentation and it's very musical as opposed to the pop thing that was happening before for her. I think she finally <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> her record and her chance to do exactly what she wants." [...] In March 2003, Simpson revealed that her third album would <b>be</b> called In <b>This</b> Skin.|$|R
5000|$|Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a B+, stating, [...] "We {{may end up}} down the road far from where we started, only to realize we moved so {{incrementally}} that we didn’t notice along the way. Hopefully, the show’s ability to combine puerile humor with sharp social commentary doesn’t disappear, whatever road it takes." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN felt differently, writing that [...] "While some will surely {{see this as a}} good sign ("if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it"), I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> a missed opportunity to propel the series forward. The show had fallen into a rut and become formulaic, and just when 'You're Getting Old' gave us a hint that Trey and Matt were sick of their own antics and ready to usher in a new era of exciting changes, the boldest guys in the biz appear to be going back to what's safe and comfortable and familiar." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Wild Life {{was one of}} {{the first}} songs I {{recorded}} after moving to Los Angeles last fall. Right away, the move changed the entire direction of my music. I went from making a dark album in the hellish winter of New York to the sunny vibes of L.A. Every party or BBQ I throw, I've been playing all James Brown and P-Funk, so I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> direction <b>is</b> very natural.|$|R
5000|$|On his website, Allan {{said of the}} song: [...] "I’m super {{excited about}} this single going to radio. I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth or fifth}} time I’ve reinvented myself, or tried to push myself to do {{different}} things. I feel like I have pushed myself into a very comfortable place because it is kind of 50’s and 60’s Motown. It reminds me of when I did 'Runaway' and things like that. So it was a very easy thing for me to do. I was in rockabilly bands my whole life, and to me it was just a throwback to my youth writing with these guys. It was a lot of fun." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gary Fish {{established}} the Deschutes Brewery & Public House as small brew pub in 1988 in downtown Bend, Oregon and named {{it after the}} Deschutes River. Fish emphasized a community based approach to his business, stating, [...] "We want people to <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is,</b> {{in a lot of}} ways, theirs." [...] The brewery sold 310 barrels of beer in its first year, and by 1992, sales were up to 3,954 barrels. Unable to keep up with demand in its original facility, the brewery expanded to a 16,000 sq ft production brewery in 1993 with the ability to brew in 50-barrel batches. Deschutes now has a brewing facility with two brew houses, distributing its beer in twenty-eight states. A Deschutes brew pub opened in the Pearl District of Portland, Oregon in May 2008.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well-received by critics. Dead Press UK praised the album's similar sound to Dethroned & Uncrowned, concluding that [...] "Despite these tracks being {{taken from a}} whole host of Katatonia‘s previous albums, each one maintains the same spark of brilliance....it’s evident that a great deal of consideration goes into producing these highly intelligent and stirring songs. Whether you’re doing some soul searching or need a thought-provoking soundtrack to a gloomy winter day, Kocytean {{is a good place to}} start." [...] The Ultimate Guitar staff review praised the lyrics and elaborate sound, concluding that [...] "As the tracks are rare and B-sides you may already own several of them if you are a big fan of the band, and that may be discouraging, but I honestly <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a worthwhile release." ...|$|E
5000|$|During an {{appearance}} on The Dr. Oz Show in May 2015, Jackman clarified the confusion over the conflicting sentiments, by stating bluntly that the film would be his final portrayal as the character; he said, [...] "This will be my last one, it is my last time. It just {{felt like it was}} the right time to do it, and let's be honest, 17 years. I never thought in a million years it would last, so I'm so grateful to the fans for the opportunity of playing it. I kind of have in my head what we're going to do in this last one. It just <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the perfect way to go out." [...] Jackman has also explained that Jerry Seinfeld has convinced him to quit the role stating, [...] "He said to me, when you're creating something it's very important not to run yourself dry. It's not about finishing on top, necessarily, but making sure you're, creatively, still got something left, which propels you into the whatever's next." ...|$|R
5000|$|I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> one <b>is</b> kind of self-explanatory, but it's about {{trust and}} {{being there for}} people {{when you say you}} will be. I'm {{the kind of person who}} says what I mean, and <b>this</b> song <b>is</b> about keeping your word. - Jeremy McKinnon, on [...] "Have Faith in Me", 2009 The song was written by A Day to Remember, with lyrics by vocalist Jeremy McKinnon and Jason Lancaster. The lyrics are about trusting other people, and looking after them.|$|R
5000|$|Jesse Schedeen from IGN {{rated the}} episode with 8.5/10. [...] "As much as I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> show <b>is</b> wasting good {{storytelling}} potential {{in terms of}} the tension between Defiance and the E-Rep, there's plenty of smaller character drama to keep this show moving. The Tarr family was as fascinating as ever in this episode. And as Irisa and Amanda struggle with their personal demons, the show is making better use of its full cast as it did in Season 1".|$|R
5000|$|Qadiri {{began writing}} her second album around February/March 2015 while {{having to be}} a room in her Kuwait home due to a knee injury. She {{was looking at a}} [...] "horrific news cycle" [...] on Twitter, being [...] "moved" [...] by seeing protests going on in places such as Ferguson and Baltimore. This {{inspired}} Qadiri to make a record about protesting halfway into writing her next record. As she explained in a Thump interview, [...] "I also saw it as a challenge. Protest music is a real genre, and {{there have been a lot}} of seminal protest records. I just <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a subject that's moving a lot of people right now." [...] The first track completed for the album was [...] "Blood Moon," [...] the last [...] "Oubliette." ...|$|E
5000|$|Walker {{explained}} the album to The Torch, when he said, [...] "It's very stripped down. There isn't {{a lot of}} production or synthesizers. That's why I really {{wanted to work with}} Keith Stegall on this. I wanted to get that great George Strait sound. It just sounds so much better because you can hear all the instruments and all the lyrics. This is definitely a more traditional-type record than I have released in the recent past. It reminds me more of the first album I released." [...] He also said, [...] ""I really <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> going to launch the next part of our career. I'd like to just stay on the charts {{over the next five years}} or so. Maybe get some Awards and nominations and do some TV." ...|$|E
5000|$|When Ultimate Bet was {{involved}} in a major cheating scandal prior to 2008, Friedman {{was one of the biggest}} victims having lost millions of dollars. After rumors started to surface, in December 2010, that Friedman would be signing with UB, many people in the poker community criticized Friedman. [...] When asked how he could sign with a poker site where he was cheated out of millions, Friedman said, [...] "I feel like they took care of me after the scandal. I feel like they didn’t have to pay people back and they did. It was amazing to find out I was going to get a hunk of money back. I have a good relationship with their team and their management and I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a totally different UB than anything associated with the scandal." ...|$|E
5000|$|His father, {{speaking}} {{of the fact that}} he has two sons playing in the National Football League, said: [...] "I just kvell." [...] His mother, commenting on having two sons play football, said: I started out worrying that they were going to get hurt—but then I realized it was the other players I should be worrying about. They were like trucks hitting small cars. And I started to kind of <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> maybe <b>this</b> <b>was</b> their destiny.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{think my}} {{music is a}} dark comedy, just as I think life is a dark comedy," [...] said Brandy. [...] "The truth is funny sometimes. I don't ever want to come across as corny or novelty, {{but you have to}} laugh at things. I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> record <b>is</b> about what's really going on in life." [...] "I get my {{inspiration}} from real people who are just surviving their lives and getting through their days. That's who I write songs for," [...] she explained.|$|R

The song was then released for digital download on October 22, 2013 [...] Then on October 29, 2013, it was serviced to rhythmic contemporary radio in the U.S.|$|R
