40|$|Some {{complex systems}} {{experience}} multiple dependent competing <b>failure</b> <b>processes,</b> and many traditional approaches to reliability are inadequate or inappropriate {{because there are}} two or more dependent/correlated <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> and multiple components subject to failure. A typical design example representative of these systems is Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems. The dependency among the <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> and the dependency among the component failure times present challenging issues in reliability modeling. In reality, for many actual engineering problems, there are interactions between soft failure and catastrophic failure {{that should not be}} ignored. Also, interaction among components should be considered. This paper develops a new reliability model and optimal preventive maintenance policies for complex multi-component systems experiencing multiple <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> due to simultaneous exposure to degradation and shock loads. The developed reliability and maintenance models are demonstrated for a multicomponent systems example. These models can also be applied directly or customized for other complex systems that experience multiple dependent competing <b>failure</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Two {{processes}} {{known as}} rubbing and ridging {{are responsible for}} acoustical emissions similar to those from ice calving. Rubbing involves two or more areas of compacted glacial ice floes which are being forced together, inducing shear deformation at its edges and triggering horizontally-polarized shear waves, i. e. SH waves. Ridging occurs when that ice bends or slides at the ridges. According to Dr. Xie, both events will produce sound in the failure sequence (breakup) of an ice floe:"A wave equation resulting from shear deformation will be defined in an ice floe with the rubbing effect coupled to the floe through its boundary with the adjacent ice," [...] while [...] "ridging deformation(s) revealed by this event indicate that the <b>failure</b> <b>process</b> {{is associated with a}} crushing process that seals air or vacuous gaps between ice floes. The acoustical signals emitted by this <b>failure</b> <b>process</b> are similar to those emitted from a collapsing air bubble in a fluid." ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> of {{repairable}} {{systems may}} be impacted by operational and environmental stress factors. To accommodate such factors, reliability can be modelled using a multiplicative intensity function. In the proportional intensity model, the failure intensity {{is the product}} of the failure intensity function of the baseline system that quantifies intrinsic factors and a function of covariates that quantifies extrinsic factors. The existing literature has extensively studied the <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> of repairable systems using general repair concepts such as age-reduction when no covariate effects are considered. This paper investigates different approaches for modelling the <b>failure</b> and repair <b>process</b> of repairable systems in the presence of time-dependent covariates.

Recently, NIOSH {{has embarked on a}} research program to evaluate the use of microseismic monitoring information to identify roof fall <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> and to assess its potential to warn of unstable roof conditions. Large roof instabilities, such as roof falls and certain roof caving events, have proven difficult to anticipate representing an increased risk to miners working in these inherently hazardous areas. When local <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> are better understood, appropriate control measures can be engineered to mitigate these hazards. This study used microseismic emissions to help identify three local rock <b>failure</b> <b>processes.</b> It was also shown that analysis of microseismic emissions can aid in assessing the degree of instability associated with these local rock <b>failure</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

In this paper we analyze failure logs to identify simultaneous and potentially correlated {{failures in}} routers and links of an IP backbone network. We show that the actual behavior of <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> does not support the independence assumption commonly used in theoretical studies. Scatter plots are presented to visualize the <b>failure</b> <b>processes,</b> and it is seen that geographical adjacency has a pronounced effect. The existence of high correlation coefficients and high autocorrelation in some <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> was observed. A formal analysis confirms this.

50|$|Both {{research}} approaches {{show some}} irregularities. While the quantitative approach lacks transparency concerning its indicators and their balancing {{in the evaluation}} process of countries, the qualitative approach shows a diversity of different foci. One of the major discrepancies is the question whether all the stages {{have to be taken}} continuously or if a state can skip one phase. Schneckener stresses that his model should actually not be interpreted as a stage model as, in his opinion, states do not necessarily undergo every stage. Robert I. Rotbergâ€™s model underlies an ordinal logic and thus, implies that the state <b>failure</b> <b>process</b> is a chronological chain of phases.|$|E
40|$|For {{complex systems}} that {{experience}} Multiple Dependent Competing <b>Failure</b> <b>Processes</b> (MDCFP), the dependency among the <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> presents challenging issues in reliability modeling. This article, develops reliability models and preventive maintenance policies for systems subject to MDCFP. Specifically, two dependent/correlated <b>failure</b> <b>processes</b> are considered: soft failures caused jointly by continuous smooth degradation and additional abrupt degradation damage {{due to a}} shock <b>process</b> and catastrophic <b>failures</b> caused by an abrupt and sudden stress from the same shock process. A general reliability model is developed based on degradation and random shock modeling (i. e., extreme and cumulative shock models), which is then extended to a specific model for a linear degradation path and normally distributed shock load sizes and damage sizes. A preventive maintenance policy using periodic inspection is also developed by minimizing the average long-run maintenance cost rate. The developed reliability and maintenance models are demonstrated for a micro-electro-mechanical systems application example. These models can also be applied directly or customized for other complex systems that experience multiple dependent competing <b>failure</b> <b>processes...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} <b>process</b> <b>failures</b> in postoperative care, to assess their frequency and preventability, and to explore their relationship to adverse events. BACKGROUND: Adverse events are common and are frequently caused by <b>failures</b> in the <b>process</b> of care. These processes are often evaluated independently using clinical audit. There is little understanding of <b>process</b> <b>failures</b> {{in terms of their}} overall frequency, relative risk, and cumulative effect on the surgical patient. METHODS: Patients were observed daily from the first postoperative day until discharge by an independent surgeon. Field notes on the circumstances surrounding any nonroutine or atypical event were recorded. Field notes were assessed by 2 surgeons to identify <b>failures</b> in the <b>process</b> of care. Preventability, the degree of harm caused to the patient, and the underlying etiology of <b>process</b> <b>failures</b> were evaluated by 2 independent surgeons. RESULTS: Fifty patients undergoing major elective general surgery were observed for a total of 659 days of postoperative care. A total of 256 <b>process</b> <b>failures</b> were identified, of which 85 % were preventable and 51 % directly led to patient harm. <b>Process</b> <b>failures</b> occurred in all aspects of care, the most frequent being medication prescribing and administration, management of lines, tubes, and drains, and pain control interventions. <b>Process</b> <b>failures</b> accounted for 57 % of all preventable adverse events. Communication failures and delays were the main etiologies, leading to 54 % of <b>process</b> <b>failures.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Process</b> <b>failures</b> are common in postoperative care, are highly preventable, and frequently cause harm to patients. Interventions to prevent <b>process</b> <b>failures</b> will improve the reliability of surgical postoperative care and have the potential to reduce hospital stay...|$|R

30|$|From the four-point bending tests, it was {{observed}} that the <b>failure</b> <b>process</b> was governed by the connector capacity, or more specifically the initiation and progression of connector pull-out from the TRRPC panels. Since a description of the pull-out <b>failure</b> <b>process</b> is not included in the FE-model, this phenomenon is not explicitly captured. Nevertheless, the forces in the connector from the analysis can be compared to the experimental pull-out capacity of a single connector (6.5 Â kN) mentioned in Sect.Â  3.3. From Fig.Â  17, the applied load levels, 9.2 Â kN (S-FE) and 15.3 Â kN (D-FE), in which the modelled GRFP bars have a maximum tensile force equal to the tested pull-out load, correspond rather well with the level at which the pull-out <b>failure</b> <b>process</b> starts in the tests for both connector configurations.|$|E
