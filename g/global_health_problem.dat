5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} <b>global</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{availability}} of the hepatitis B vaccine, vaccination rates outside the US are low and hepatitis B remains a <b>global</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> Therefore, many children worldwide remain unvaccinated and many adults may be chronic carriers. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are 350-400 million people with chronic hepatitis B and many are not even aware of their condition. Although most hepatitis B carriers have no symptoms, they can still transmit the infection and develop liver cancer.|$|E

50|$|ISAAC has {{demonstrated}} that asthma and allergies are a <b>global</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> and environmental factors are key. The scientific value of ISAAC is attested to by {{the large number of}} publications produced by ISAAC collaborators, who have published more than 340 articles in over 100 journals including the Lancet, the British Medical Journal, the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Thorax and the European Respiratory Journal. The major effect of the findings has been to stimulate debates concerning the causes of the global variations in asthma, rhinitis and eczema, aided by the hypotheses suggested by the findings of the ecological analyses. ISAAC findings are cited by any organisation involved in monitoring and preventing Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRD’s) and are used to inform Global Health Initiatives which include WHO, and its NGO (Non Governmental Organisation) the Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD). ISAAC publications are included in the ‘GARD Basket’, a package of information, offered to countries by WHO to assist policy decisions relating to CRD’s.|$|E
50|$|Malaria is a <b>global</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem</b> {{that threatens}} 300-500 {{million people and}} kills {{more than one million}} people annually. The chloroquine-based drugs that were used widely in the past have lost {{effectiveness}} because the Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria has become resistant to them. Artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide, extracted from Artemisia annua L is highly effective against Plasmodium spp. resistant to other anti-malarial drugs. However, there are several problems with current production methods for artemisinin. First, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are too expensive for people in the Developing World to afford. Second, artemisinin is extracted from A. annua, and its yield and consistency depend on climate and the extraction process. While there is a method for chemical synthesis of artemisinin, it is too low yielding and therefore too expensive for use in producing low-cost drugs. Third, although the World Health Organization has recommended that artemisinin be formulated with other active pharmaceutical ingredients in ACTs, many manufacturers are still producing mono-therapies of artemisinin, which increase the chance that Plasmodium spp. will develop resistance to artemisinin.|$|E
50|$|Tuberculosis is {{a terrible}} disease and an urgent <b>global</b> <b>health</b> <b>problem.</b> About {{one third of the}} world {{population}} is infected with the bacterium that causes it and the disease has an annual incidence of 8.8 million new cases and a death toll of approximately 1.5 million people per year. The global economic cost of TB is estimated to be hundreds of billions of dollars. The impact on society is equally astonishing exemplified by the fact that some 10 million children have been orphaned due to TB. Modelling studies predict that vaccines that prevent TB in adults and adolescents and that prevent TB in latently infected individuals will have the strongest impact on the TB epidemic.Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG), currently the only available vaccine is not effective in these populations. This vaccine, used since 1921, can protect children from severe forms of tuberculosis. However, BCG has little to no efficacy in preventing pulmonary TB in (young) adults, the most common and most infectious form of tuberculosis. Moreover, there are serious safety concerns regarding the use of BCG in HIV infected newborns.|$|E
