40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the performance of}} chief <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> (U. <b>S.</b> attorneys) and their subsequent careers. In a sample of 570 attorneys in office from 1969 to 2000, the length of prison sentences is positively related to subsequent favorable career outcomes for U. S. attorneys. In contrast, conviction rates {{do not appear to}} affect the careers of U. S. attorneys. These results are consistent with longer total prison sentences' being personally beneficial to prosecutors, and prosecutors' maximizing the length of prison sentences. Overall, the results suggest that sentence length, as opposed to convictions rates, is the relevant performance metric. Copyright 2005, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

40|$|Beginning in 1969, the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia began {{developing}} and installing, {{with the help}} of management consultants, a computerized record keeping process that {{came to be known as}} the Prosecutor 2 ̆ 7 s Management Information System, or PROMIS. Unlike other <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors,</b> the U. <b>S.</b> Attorney in the District of Columbia is responsible for prosecuting felonies under local law and shares many of the problems of court backlog and scarcity of resources familiar to local prosecutors in other large cities. PROMIS is a computer data bank in which six kinds of information are collected and correlated with each other for every criminal case litigated by the U. S. Attorney 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>office.</b> The computer will report information about the defendant (such as aliases, prior arrests and convictions, age, race, sex, and employment status), the crime (such as the amount of violence and property damage, the number of persons accused of working with the defendant, and the date and place of the incident), the arrest (such as the type of arrest and the names of the arresting officers), the offense or offenses charged (such as the charges at arrest, the charges actually placed after initial screening by a prosecutor, and the reasons for any changes), the witnesses (such as name, address, evidentiary value, and assessment of whether there will be problems getting a given witness to testify), and the court history of the case (such as the date and substance of every court event from arraignment to sentencing, the cause of each event, and the names of the prosecutor, defense attorney, and judge involved at each stage). Information about the defendant and the offense of which he is accused is computed through formulate that produce a case priority rating which allows the office to single out certain cases for special attention and provides the basis for detailed supervision, through guidelines, of each Assistant U.

40|$|<b>Federal</b> <b>Prosecutors</b> in Brazil work {{far beyond}} {{criminal}} prosecution {{because of its}} unique constitucional design.

According to the legal framework, which has the parameters that must be followed by <b>Federal</b> <b>Prosecutors,</b> stablished between 1988 constitution to 2014 National Plan of Education, indigenous schools must preserve their language, traditions and creeds, and enable them to be on an equal footing {{with the rest of the}} national community.

40|$|The McDade Amendment (2 ̆ 2 the Act 2 ̆ 2) is {{a federal}} law that {{requires}} <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> {{to abide by the}} state ethics rules of the jurisdiction in which they practice. The Act does not say, however, whether federal or state courts are definitive when it comes to interpreting state ethics rules as they apply to <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors.</b> Those testifying before Congress raised this issue and noted that the Act left the issue unresolved. Despite this, Congress did not address this matter in either its legislative history or in the Act itself. No court has tackled this question and scholarship attends to it only in passing. At this time, both federal and state courts interpret state ethics rules as they apply to <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors.</b> As it currently stands, with both court systems interpreting the rules and no determination as to which is definitive, <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> must comply with both federal and state court interpretations. This is likely to chill <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> in the exercise of their official duties because they are bound to be unsure of the rules they must abide by. More importantly, concurrent interpretation creates unsolvable conflicts when a federal and state court in the same jurisdiction interpret the same rule differently. This Note explores whether federal or state courts 2 ̆ 7 interpretations of state ethics rules are definitive as applied to <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors</b> under the McDade Amendment. It considers the plain text of the Act, its legislative history, and the purposes and policies of the legislation. Ultimately, this Note argues that the legal community should regard state courts 2 ̆ 7 interpretations as definitive. This Note concludes by proposing a framework for federal courts to defer to state courts 2 ̆ 7 interpretations of ethics rules as they apply to <b>federal</b> <b>prosecutors...</b>|$|R
