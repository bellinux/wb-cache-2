500|$|In April 1977, Alyeska filed {{a notice}} that it {{intended}} to start filling the pipeline sometime between June 20 and July 1. Engineers {{had to face}} several problems when filling the pipeline. First was the need to balance temperatures: Filled by air, the steel pipeline was about [...] degrees. The oil emerging from wells at Prudhoe Bay was more than [...] degrees, {{and there was a}} danger that if it was introduced before intermediate warming, the pipeline could crack because of thermal expansion. The second problem came when the pipeline needed to be purged of air {{in order to reduce the}} danger of fire or explosion. Usually, a pipeline is filled with water first, and the oil pushes the water ahead of it, purging the pipeline as <b>it</b> <b>goes.</b> <b>In</b> Alaska, there was a fear that the water would freeze in the pipeline, damaging it. This problem was solved when pressurized nitrogen was used instead of water.|$|E

500|$|An {{immediate}} focus during pre-production was Deadpool's suit, with Russ Shinkle and Film Illusions hired {{to create the}} costume. Shinkle noted that [...] "comic book art is fairly over the top in terms of physique", {{and he tried to}} balance that with reality. Reynolds did not wear a muscle suit under the costume, which Tim Miller felt gave the costume a slimmer, [...] "quintessential Deadpool" [...] look. Miller and Reynolds wept when they saw the completed costume, with Reynolds explaining that [...] "we fought like hell ... to make this the most faithful comic book to movie adaptation fans have ever seen. That’s hard to accomplish and a feat, but we’re just so happy with how this came out." [...] The costume was designed with the film's stunts in mind, with the eye areas on the mask removable so versions of the eyes better suited for the stunts could be used without changing the whole mask. The suit was difficult for the visual effects team to replicate with CGI, which visual effects supervisor Jonathan Rothbart blamed on its fabric. He described it as mesh that allowed dirt to [...] "get into the gutters and the cracks ... the light hits it, it still takes that orangey hue but as soon as <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> the shadow it dropped to this more blueish of the dirt." [...] Film Illusions made six hero versions of the costume and twelve stunt-specific versions, along with three hero versions of Negasonic Teenage Warhead's costume.|$|E

Further, the umpire has nor exceeded his powers by stating that the only alternative to open lamps, namely safety lamps, shall be adopted. At all events he has determined the question that the working of the mine with open lamps is dangerous, and his award ought not to be set aside, even if <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> other respects beyond the scope of his authority. [...] I [...] can see no reason therefore, why the award should not go back to him so that it may be put into form. When that is done, it will be for the mine owner to remedy the defect, for if he does not he will be, if the next tribunal [...] is against him, be liable to the penalties under the Act." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{one week}} before {{recording}} was due to start, a dearth of material became apparent: [...] "I had four songs written, because {{that was all the}} lyrics I had from Graham. And I realized I wasn't getting any more words out of him. So I had to write a song a day so there was enough. Graham came with a couple of things, {{but there was no way}} he would come with enough songs to fill out the rest of the record. So I took an instant editorial decision that was what was going to happen. Some of those words stayed, and some of those words got worked on by Graham and me. That was it, basically." [...] The band worked on more than a dozen songs, dropping those that were not [...] "working quite well enough". Many of the songs were recorded in a single take, the band playing as a threesome: [...] "You have to understand, as a three-piece, we'd very rarely played together. [...] So [...] I thought, 'Let's see how <b>it</b> <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> the studio.' We worked with an engineer that we'd never worked with before, who was Irish. We did 'Moreover,' and after we were done playing, he came in and said, 'You make a big fookin' noise for three.'" [...] The band felt vindicated.|$|E
