40|$|The {{value of}} {{multiple}} informant methodology {{for improving the}} validity in determining organizational properties has been increasingly recognized. However, the majority of empirical research still relies on single (key) informants. This {{is partly due to}} the lack of comprehensive methodological narratives and precise recommendations on the application of this impor-tant methodology. Therefore, the authors have <b>developed</b> a <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> and derived clear recommendations for the key challenges that researchers face in using multiple informants: (1) Which and how many informants should be considered? (2) How should the consensus among the informants be judged? (3) How are multiple responses combined into a single, organi-zational response to conduct further data analyses...|$|R

In parallel, {{the number of patients}} that are available for the placebo arm of trials has declined, and more-aggressive drugs are being <b>developed.</b> A <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> is warranted to ensure efficient MRI - and patient - resource utilization. Recently, an international panel reviewed the methodology for efficient use of MRI-monitored trials in relapse-onset MS. In this article, we provide up-to-date recommendations for scan acquisition, image analysis, outcome-measure definition and standards of reporting. Factors to consider for optimizing trial design, such as outcome measure selection and the unique requirements of phase II and phase III trials, including active-comparator studies, are outlined. Finally, we address safety considerations in the use of MRI in MS trials, and the safety-related responsibilities of the various parties involved in conducting such trials. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|An {{injector}} is {{a particular}} type of jet pump which uses condensable vapor to entrain a liquid and discharge against a pressure higher than either motive or suction pressures. The injector has no moving parts and requires no external power supply nor any complex control system. Thus, the injector is particularly suited for emergency core cooling operations. A detailed survey has indicated that various injector designs are available for operating pressures below 250 psig. However, the design of these injectors from the viewpoint of a basic understanding of heat and mass transfer processes has not been well <b>developed.</b> A <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of the models showed serious discrepancies between the analytical models and the experimental observations. The discrepancies evolved from the neglect of non-equilibrium aspects of the flow. The origin of the non-equilibrium aspects {{can be traced to the}} extremely small time scales governing the flow in the injector. Thus, time scales of the order of 10 {sup {minus} 2 } seconds are involved in the injector, accompanied by mass, momentum, and heat transfer rates of orders of magnitude higher than that observed in conventional two-phase flows. The present study focuses on the phenomenological and mathematical modeling of the processes in the injector from the viewpoint of its non-equilibrium nature...|$|R

Many authors {{have addressed the}} topic previously, both from an economic and from a sociological perspective. However, recent literature evinces dissatisfaction with both analytical frameworks and the framing of public policies addressing the brain drain problematic. This paper is a {{contribution to understanding the}} historical and theoretical foundations of the >brain drain> debate. We aim to improve conceptual clarity regarding the itinerancy of human beings and the mobilization of human capital. We <b>develop</b> a <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of the economics of the brain drain, highlighting the work of some key early thinkers and pointing out the way in which subsequent work has taken up selected aspects of their approaches leaving other challenges aside. We then consider the diaspora networks literature, which is characterized as taking a >connectionist> approach to the brain drain. We identify two fundamental problems: the sidelining of complementarity and context dependency as basic properties of human capital; and a failure to adequately disentangle the concepts of human resources for science and technology (HRST) and human capital in academic and policy discourse about the brain drain.

40|$|To {{construct}} a taxonomy of passive behaviors for understanding people with Alzheimer's disease. Passive behaviors are {{those associated with}} decreased motor movements, decreasing interactions with the environment, and feelings of apathy and listlessness. Little is known about behaviors associated with passivity, and these behaviors have not been categorized. Organizing Construct : Taxonomy construction. Passive behaviors in people with Alzheimer's disease were conceptualized as disturbing behaviors, patterns of personality change, and negative symptoms. Methods : The taxonomy was <b>developed</b> using <b>critical</b> <b>reviews</b> of 15 empirical studies published 1985 through 1998. Procedures included listing behaviors; clustering behaviors into inductively derived groupings; conducting an expert panel-review, making revisions, and conduting a second review; establishing global and category-by-category reliability using Cohen's Kappa. Findings : The nonhierarchic, natural taxonomy indicated five categories of behaviors associated with passivity in Alzheimer's disease: diminutions of cognition, psychomotor activity, emotions, interactions with people, and interactions with the environment. Analysis indicated substantial agreement beyond chance and showed statistically significant agreement among the six nurse-expert raters. Areas of synchrony between the taxonomy and the Need-Driven Dementia Compromised Behavior Model were identified. Conclusions : This taxonomy of passive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer's disease showed empirical rigor and compatibility with a middle-range theory and {{can be viewed as}} a sensitizing analytic scheme to guide future practice, research, and theory development...|$|R

40|$|The risks {{associated}} with the transport of spent nuclear fuel by truck and rail have been reexamined and compared to results published in NUREG-O 170 and the Modal Study. The full reexamination considered transport of PWR and BWR spent fuel by truck and rail in four generic Type B spent fuel casks. Because they are typical, this paper presents results only for transport of PWR spent fuel in steel-lead steel casks. Cask and spent fuel response to collision impacts and fires were evaluated by performing three-dimensional finite element and one-dimensional heat transport calculations. Accident release fractions were <b>developed</b> by <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of literature data. Accident severity fractions were developed from Modal Study truck and rail accident event trees, modified to reflect the frequency of occurrence of hard and soft rock wayside route surfaces as determined by analysis of geographic data. Incident-free population doses and the population dose {{risks associated}} with the accidents that might occur during transport were calculated using the RADTRAN 5 transportation risk code. The calculated incident-free doses were compared to those published in NUREG-O 170. The calculated accident dose risks were compared to dose risks calculated using NUREG- 0170 and Modal Study accident source terms. The comparisons demonstrated that both of these studies {{made a number of}} very conservative assumptions about spent fuel and cask response to accident conditions, which caused their estimates of accident source terms, accident frequencies, and accident consequences to also be very conservative. The results of this study and the previous studies demonstrate that the {{risks associated with}} the shipment of spent fuel by truck or rail are very small...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionIn 2014, {{vaccination}} {{was included}} {{within the scope}} of practice for Australian pharmacists. A number of Australian pharmacy schools have either commenced or are planning to incorporate vaccination training into pharmacy curricula. The primary objective {{of this article is to}} articulate the process undertaken to develop an Australian vaccination training program with nested injection skills training for pharmacy students. Material and methodsA set of learning outcomes, assessable knowledge, and assessable skills were <b>developed</b> following a <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of relevant literature, guided by the Australian Pharmacy Council Standards for the Accreditation of Programs to Support Pharmacist Administration of Vaccines. This ensures that the modules will enable students to demonstrate competency required for vaccination, similar to that of current Australian vaccinators: doctors, nurses, and pharmacists. ResultsA vaccination training program with nested injection skills training was developed and validated. The new teaching and learning concepts will be integrated and delivered via spiral curriculum. Knowledge and skills should progressively improve as students advance through the pharmacy course. Core skills will be assessed on a number of occasions. Integrated modules are embedded into the first year, third year, and fourth year of the pharmacy program.

40|$|International audienceA {{central issue}} of human-animal {{interactions}} has been, and continues, to be mainly {{focused on the}} emotional and positive aspects that fixe the imagination of both public and researchers. It is particularly highlighted {{in the use of}} animals in therapeutic situations that involved ‘weaker’ people. After a historical report and a clarification of the term ‘animal assisted therapy’, we propose to <b>develop</b> a <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of these particular therapies using horses as well as other species (i. e. dog, dolphin). It is firstly required to establish why animals are widely considered as potential therapists. We examine the theoretical framework included the relaxing effect and the social substitute status that animals can have, as well as the simple non verbal interactions between human and animal developed. We secondly describe several empirical researches to illustrate the heterogeneity (e. g. people, animal used) as well as the weakness of these studies (e. g. methodological devices, subjectivity, case studies) with a focused on autistic disorders. Thus, clear scientific evidence is still lacking and a need arises to better understand the relations between people and animals especially in a reproducible therapeutic ways. A project is currently led by different scientific teams to explore finely the relations between children, both with typical and autistic development- and animals, according to different contexts. We here present some results that reveal, on the one hand, the importance of owning a pet in the development of children with autism. On the other hand, the practice of horse riding is explored both in a typical practice in an equestrian club and in a therapeutic way. The results show an impact on children behaviors with unfamiliar animals. Other results are also discussed in the light of animal assisted therapies, providing us some ways of thinking about methodology and studies in research and the applications of animals in assisted therapies...|$|R
40|$|The legalization and {{availability}} of new forms of gambling are increasing in most Western countries. This trend {{has contributed to the}} fact that more individuals are developing gambling problems. As a result, {{there is a need for}} effective treatments. Although gambling treatment dates several decades, few empirically supported treatments for pathological gambling have been <b>developed.</b> This <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> includes only controlled treatment studies. The primary inclusion criterion was randomization of participants to an experimental group and to at least 1 control group. Eleven studies were identified and evaluated. Key findings showed that cognitive–behavioral studies received the best empirical support. Recommendations to improve gambling treatment research include better validated psychometric mea-sures, inclusion of process measures, better definition of outcomes, and more precise definition of treatments. The legalization of new types of gambling, which can be defined as an attempt to win money by staking money on an uncertain event, is increasing in most Western countries. With prevalence rates hovering between 1 % and 2 %, the increased availability of gambling is expected to lead to greater numbers of people devel-oping gambling problems. Pathological gambling was officially recognized in 1980 with the publication of the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–III; American Psychiatric Association, 1980); it was classified as an impulse control disorder. Pathological gambling is characterized by a loss of control over gambling, deception about the extent of one’s involvement with gambling, family and job disruption, theft, and chasing losses, or the effort to win back money lost while gambling (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). It is now acknowledged that the prevalence of pathological gambling is related to the availability of gambling opportunities, legal or illega...|$|R
40|$|Safety is a {{major concern}} for {{construction}} companies, as it is a source of substantial direct and indirect costs. In some countries, the rate of total workplace injuries from construction activities can be as high as at least 50 %. This is undoubtedly a serious matter warranting urgent attention. In the past decade, interest in the nature of 'safety climate' and its role in predicting occupational accidents and injuries has increased. However, research findings regarding the relationships between safety climate and other key outcomes constructs such as safety behaviours and safety outcomes are to some extent inconsistent. Recent safety climate literature suggests that examining the role of safety motivation may help provide a better explanation on such relationships. In view of this, the authors of this paper have developed a conceptual model depicting the relationships between four main constructs: Safety Motivation, Safety Climate, and Safety Behaviour. In particular, the model hypothesises that Safety Climate has a mediating role on the relationship between Safety Motivation and Safety Behaviour. The aim of the research study presented in this paper was to empirically assess the proposed conceptual model within the context of Saudi Construction Industry. To achieve this, a questionnaire was <b>developed</b> through <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> of literature and was pilot tested with a number of safety management experts. A survey was then administered in Saudi Arabia targeting project managers, site managers, site engineers and supervisors at construction workplaces. In total, 430 sets of questionnaire were distributed and 265 valid responses returned. Based on this dataset, a series of statistical analyses have been performed including basic descriptive analysis, Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses as well as Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The results from the analysis support that Safety Climate fully mediated the relationship between Safety Motivation and Safety Behaviour, within the context of Saudi Construction Industry.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionThimerosal (or Thiomersal) is a {{trade name}} for an organomercurial {{compound}} (sodium ethyl-mercury (Hg) thiosalicylate) that is 49. 55 % Hg by weight, which rapidly decomposes in aqueous saline solutions into ethyl-Hg hydroxide and ethyl-Hg chloride. Developed in 1927, {{it has been}} and is still {{being used as a}} preservative in some cosmetics, topical pharmaceuticals, and biological drug products, including vaccines. Concerns have been voiced about its use because it is toxic to human cells. Although it is banned in several countries, it continues to be added to some vaccines in the United States and many vaccines in the <b>developing</b> world. DiscussionThis <b>critical</b> <b>review</b> focuses on the clinical, epidemiological, and biochemical studies of adverse effects from Thimerosal in developing humans. This review will include research that examines fetal, infant, and childhood death; birth defects; neurodevelopmental testing deficits in children; and neurodevelopmental disorders (attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, tic disorder, and specific developmental delays). The review will also look at the research that examined the outcomes of acute accidental ethyl-Hg poisoning in humans. The studies that examine the underlying biochemical insights into the neuronal cellular damage will also be explored. ConclusionThe culmination of the research that examines the effects of Thimerosal in humans indicates that it is a poison at minute levels with a plethora of deleterious consequences, even at the levels currently administered in vaccines...|$|R
