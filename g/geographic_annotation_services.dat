The emplacement process is applied to model the <b>geographic</b> <b>annotation</b> behavior. First and foremost, according to the frequency class, need confirm the <b>geographic</b> <b>annotation</b> text classification need confirming and establishing a quantitative convergence description about the spatial self-correlation in the emplacement adjacency based on Voronoi k order vicinity relationship. Proceeding further, an emplacement algorithm for the types of geographical annotation and transformative type is built in combination with the <b>geographic</b> text <b>annotation</b> and the de facto geographical annotation neighborhood. Lastly, through empirical results, in the practical situation of two typological <b>geographic</b> <b>annotation</b> sets having been known already, emplacement algorithm can come to be effective appraisal about the newly augmented <b>geographic</b> <b>annotation</b> in a practicable way...|$|R

A novel 2. 5 D paradigm is proposed that provides a robust and practical solution based on separating and then integrating back again the networked and geographical dimensions of the input dataset. This allows us to easily cope with partial or incomplete <b>geographic</b> <b>annotations,</b> to reduce cluttering of close entities, and to address focus-plus-context visualization issues. Typical application domains include, for example, coordinating search and rescue teams or medical evacuation squads, monitoring ad-hoc networks, exploring location-based social networks and, more in general, visualizing relational datasets including <b>geographic</b> <b>annotations...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{advances}} in the standardization of knowledge representation lan-guages to realize the Semantic Web as well as {{advances in}} natural language processing techniques have resulted in increased commercial efforts to create so called <b>annotation</b> <b>services</b> which aim to annotate web content with metadata. Description Logics-based metadata are symbolic descriptions of some content, e. g., web content, with semantics defined through so called ontologies. Ontologies {{play a central role}} for the definition of semantics {{in the context of the}} Semantic Web. Currently, <b>annotation</b> <b>services</b> can be exploited to build content-driven applications. However for such applications to of-fer more valuable functionality, current <b>annotation</b> <b>services</b> should provide for richer metadata. Rich metadata describe a deeper and more abstract level of information through complex relational structures. In this paper we describe use cases that require richer metadata than currently provided by <b>annotation</b> <b>services</b> and describe a content-driven application that implements them. The use cases focus on geography-aware multimedia navigation, content activation and retrieval of semantically related multi-media. Furthermore a declarative process to extract richer metadata is introduced. ...|$|R

In this paper, we present Melita, a tool for the definition and development of ontology-based <b>annotation</b> <b>services.</b> Melita goes beyond the dichotomy rule learning Vs rule writing of classic annotation systems, as it allows adopting different strategies, from annotating examples in a corpus for training a learner to rule writing and even a mixture of them.

40|$|In most {{contemporary}} digital library management systems (DLMS) the contents are conveyed {{to the user}} as a “collection of information items”, which can be searched or browsed. However, this paradigm is often not sufficient to cope with embedded usages, for which access to the contents is not seen as an isolated activity, {{but as part of}} a larger work process, where interaction with other users, editing and annotating documents need to be integrated. Up to now, annotations have been - in most cases - stored together with the documents they refer to in a central DL repository. With the advent of decentralized DL architectures in Grid or Peer-to-Peer environments, but also in Service-oriented architectures, these design choices need to be revised by technical solutions that allow us to manage annotations independently from a particular DLMS.
