Margarito moves with Antonio, but rejects the help of the embassy as {{he does not want to}} politicize his daughter's sainthood process. Alone, sober and dignified, Margarito takes his daughter's case in front of the Vatican ecclesiastic authorities armed with a letter of recommendation and a large lunch box type suitcase in which he carries his daughter everywhere. Margarito does not have much success, as he faces the well intentioned, but bureaucratic Vatican curia, who recommends the embassy route to promote the launching of the beatification process. Things seem not going anywhere until Margarito meets a bishop willing to personally help him. However, this bishop turns out to be an impostor who swindles Margarito from most of his money.|$|E

The aim of this work is to revisit the technique as such and check on its possibilities. For this purpose, we take a box diagram integral contributing to the photon–photon scattering amplitude in quantum electrodynamics using the negative-dimensional integration method. Our approach enables us to quickly reproduce the known results as well as six other solutions as yet unknown in the literature. These six new solutions arise quite naturally in the context of negative-dimensional integration method, revealing a promising technique to handle Feynman integrals. 1...|$|E

Experience from a Course in Game Theory: Pre- and Postclass Problem Sets as a Didactic Device* The paper summarizes my experience in teaching an undergraduate course in game theory in 1998. Students were required to submit two types of problem sets: preclass problem sets, which served as experiments, and postclass standard problem sets. The separation emphasizes the limited relevance of game theory as a tool for making predictions and giving advice. The paper summarizes the results of 41 experiments which were conducted during the course. It is argued that the crude experimental methods produced results which are not substantially different from those obtained using stricter experimental methods.

40|$|Sustainability {{reporting}} is nowadays {{considered to be}} an important tool to showcase the environmental social and economic performance of an organization. Although different frameworks for reporting are available the adoption of reporting are still less in numbers in India. The research paper aims at understanding the perception and awareness about sustainability reporting that prevails across the chemical industry in India and also tries to find the major drivers and impediments of effective sustainability reporting as perceived by the industry participants through empirical analysis. The paper also tries to identify the major factors on which the industry wants to report their sustainable performance through exploratory factor analysis. A survey was carried out in Gujarat and Maharashtra the two chemical industries infested states of India among the decision makers of different chemical firms responsible for firm’s reporting of both financial and non-financial performance. The research shows that sustainability as a concept <b>is</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>by</b> the industry but as a reporting process it has failed to reach the desired level of reporting due to its complexity and therefore non acceptance.

40|$|Pivot or Rebalance to Asia-Pacific is {{a foreign}} policy {{launched}} by the Obama administration {{at the end of}} 2011. The essence of the Pivot is that the U.

S. - as a Pacific power - is going to be right {{at the center of the}} action. The policy is best described as a set of initiatives ranging from strengthening the U. S. bilateral ties in the area and rebalancing some of the U. S. military assets form other theatres Asia- Pacific to engaging the regional multilateral organizations and negotiating new trade deals - especially the Trans-Pacific Partnership - to foster the regional prosperity. The Pivot to Asia policy, is however, quite controversial as while it <b>is</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>by</b> some Asian countries, it is criticized by China that sees it as an attempt to contain its rise.

40|$|Modern human {{societies}} have accumulated considerable power {{to modify their}} environment and the earth’s system climate as the whole. The most significant environmental changes {{are found in the}} urbanized areas. This study considers coherent changes in vegetation productivity and land surface temperature (LST) around four northern West Siberian cities, namely, Tazovsky, Nadym, Noyabrsk and Megion. These cities are located in tundra, forest-tundra, northern taiga and middle taiga bioclimatic zones correspondingly. Our analysis of 15 years (2000 – 2014) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data revealed significantly (1. 3 °C to 5. 2 °C) warmer seasonally averaged LST within the urbanized territories than those of the surrounding landscapes. The magnitude of the urban LST anomaly corresponds to climates found 300 – 600 km to the South. In the climate change perspective, this magnitude corresponds to the expected regional warming by the middle or the end of the 21 st century. Warmer urban climates, and specifically warmer upper soil layers, can support re-vegetation of the disturbed urban landscapes with more productive trees and tall shrubs. This afforestation <b>is</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>by</b> the migrant city population as it is more consistent with their traditional ecological knowledge. Survival of atypical, southern plant species encourages a number of initiatives and investment to introduce even broader spectrum of temperate blossoming trees and shrubs in urban landscapes.
