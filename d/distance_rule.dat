The mature T-cell lymphocytes exhibit an interesting characteristic, in that they are only activated by non-self cells that invade the human body. The Negative Selection Algorithm utilises an affinity matching function to ascertain whether the affinity between a newly generated (NSA) T-cell lymphocyte and a self-cell is less than a particular threshold; that is, whether the T-cell lymphocyte is activated by the self-cell. T-cell lymphocytes not activated by self-sells become mature T-cell lymphocytes. A new affinity matching function termed the feature-detection rule is introduced in this paper. The feature-detection rule utilises the interrelationship between both adjacent and non-adjacent features of a particular problem domain to determine whether an antigen is activated by an artificial lymphocyte. The performance of the featuredetection rule is contrasted with traditional affinity matching functions, currently employed within Negative Selection Algorithms, most notably the r-chunks rule (which subsumes the r-contiguous bits rule) and the hamming <b>distance</b> <b>rule.</b> This paper shows that the feature-detection rule greatly improves the detection rates and false alarm rates exhibited by the NSA (utilising the r-chunks and hamming <b>distance</b> <b>rule)</b> in addition to refuting the way in which permutation masks are currently being applied in artificial immune systems.
