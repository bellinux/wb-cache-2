5000|$|Histotrophic {{viviparity}} means embryos {{develop in}} the female’s oviducts but obtain nutrients by consuming other ova, zygotes or sibling embryos (oophagy or adelphophagy). This <b>intra-uterine</b> cannibalism occurs in some sharks and in the black salamander Salamandra atra. Marsupials excrete a [...] "uterine milk" [...] supplementing the nourishment from the yolk sak.|$|E
50|$|The scoring {{relies on}} the <b>intra-uterine</b> changes that the fetus {{undergoes}} during its maturation. Whereas the neurological criteria depend mainly upon muscle tone, the physical ones rely on anatomical changes. The neonate (less than 37 weeks of age) {{is in a state}} of physiological hypotonia. This tone increases throughout the fetal growth period, meaning a more premature baby would have lesser muscle tone.|$|E
50|$|Morgentaler {{received}} his medical education from the Université de Montréal, graduating in 1953. After receiving his Canadian citizenship, he practiced {{medicine in the}} east end of Montreal. He started as a general practitioner in 1955 but increasingly specialized in family planning, becoming one of the first Canadian doctors to perform vasectomies, to insert <b>intra-uterine</b> devices, and to provide birth control pills to unmarried women.|$|E
5000|$|... "Aplacental viviparity" [...] {{occurs when}} the female retains the embryos during the entire time of {{development}} but without any transfer of nutrients to the young. The yolk sac is {{the only source of}} nutrients for the developing embryo. There are at least two exceptions to this; some sharks gain nourishment by eating unfertilized eggs produced by the mother (oophagy or egg eating) or by eating their unborn siblings (<b>intra-uterine</b> cannibalism).|$|E
50|$|Hammond {{conducted}} {{classical studies}} on embryo {{survival in the}} early 1920s.

He was the first to crystallise the theory of metabolic rate-dependent prioritising of nutrient partitioning between tissues. He was also the first to report the duration of oestrus for lactating cows (19.3 hours) and heifers (16.1 hours). He studied closely the major changes in animal shape resulting from the domestication and selective breeding of farm animals.|$|E
50|$|Phosphoglycolate {{phosphatase}} exhibits electrophoretically distinctive variant forms. Found in {{all human}} tissues, including red cells, lymphocytes, and cultured fibroblasts, the highest enzymatic activity was noted within skeletal and cardiac muscle. Research into the genetic polymorphism indicates that PGP is likely determined by three alleles {{at a single}} autosomal locus, which is expressed in all human tissues. Preliminary observations of fetal tissue suggest that the PGP locus is also fully expressed during <b>intra-uterine</b> life. Initial research has also shown appreciable genetic variation indicated by the detection of 6 phenotypes within a small European population.|$|E
5000|$|According to The World's Religions: The Study of Religion, Traditional and New Religion, [...] "early Dianetics enthusiasts {{believed}} that attempted abortion {{of the fetus}} by its mother caused [...] "traumatic experiences in <b>intra-uterine</b> life". Stephen J. Hunt noted in Alternative Religions that Scientologists believe certain events in one's life may trigger a memory referred to in Scientology as an [...] "engram". Hunt wrote, [...] "The engram may be triggered by association of events and objects. Although the conscious mind will eventually forget an incident, the reactive mind stores every detail. According to Hubbard, {{some of the most}} powerful engrams are constructed while still in the womb. The unborn child hears the angry words of parents caught up in marital disputes or perhaps talk of abortion.|$|E
5000|$|For the {{determination}} {{of whether or not}} a child took breath after birth, questions such as whether or not it cried or registered heart activity, and especially the hydrostatic test, are considered. The Births and Deaths Registration Act defines [...] "birth" [...] as the nativity of a live child (even where such life is fleeting), and requires that all such be registered. A child is [...] "still-born" [...] if [...] "it has had at least 26 weeks of <b>intra-uterine</b> existence but showed no sign of life after complete birth." [...] These considerations were of especial significance for the important case of S v Mshumpa, where it was determined that the definition of [...] "murder" [...] did not extend to the intentional killing of a foetus. The victim of a killing had to have been born, and born alive, to qualify as a person, and for his or her killing thus to qualify as murder.|$|E

Thirty-five <b>intra-uterine</b> devices could be removed easily with hysteroscope. In one patient a fragmented Lippes Loop was removed piecemeal hysteroscopically.

40|$|The <b>intra-uterine</b> balloon {{is one of}} the commonest {{methods used}} in {{investigating}} uterine con-tractility. The micro-balloon measures the maximum <b>intra-uterine</b> pressure that is developed in a closed system as the myometrium contracts. That <b>intra-uterine</b> pressure measurement is a reliable reflection of myometrial contractility at a physiological level was shown by Csapo(1963) who recorded the electrical activity of the uterus simultaneously with <b>intra-uterine</b> pressure and found good correlation between the two in the rabbit. The micro-balloon method was adopted to study various aspects of the pharmacological control of uterine activity in late gestation in the rat by means of various anti-enzymes. Fuchs (1969) has used large <b>intra-uterine</b> balloons and Boer, Lincoln & Swaab (1975) have used pressure sensitive pills to record uterine activity during late pregnancy and parturition in rats without investigating the effect of these devices on the parturient process. The present study was an attempt to investigate the effect of an <b>intra-uterine</b> micro-balloon on the process of parturition in the rat. Timed pregnant rats of the Sprague-Dawley strain were used, Day 1 of pregnancy was indi¬ cated by spermatozoa in the vaginal smear. They were allowed free access to food and water and were housed in plastic cages in light- (07. 00 - 19. 00 h) and temperature- (22 °C) controlled rooms. They were all primiparous rats.

30|$|Not {{only the}} route of hysterectomy, e.g. {{abdominal}} or laparoscopic hysterectomy, may influence recurrence rates and all other potential factors should thus be reported in according studies. In the present study, for example, an <b>intra-uterine</b> manipulator has been used. The impact on outcomes as compared with, e.g. vaginal manipulation with a tube only is not known until now. In two previous studies on peritoneal washings before and after manipulation with an <b>intra-uterine</b> device, spread of malignant cells could be demonstrated in 2 out of 82 women with negative peritoneal washings prior to manipulation [22, 23]. Only {{one of these two}} women has sufficiently long follow-up (28  months) to report that no recurrence of malignancy has occurred [23]. Another histological phenomenon, “vascular pseudo invasion” of tumour into the blood vessels, has been described after manipulation with an <b>intra-uterine</b> balloon causing high <b>intra-uterine</b> pressures. Since this may have consequences for the staging and further therapy, this phenomenon may be regarded as undesirable and awareness among pathologists is needed [24].|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that the diabetic <b>intra-uterine</b> environment has consequences for later life. Maternal diabetes mainly results in asymmetric macrosomia. This macrosomia is associated with an increased insulin secretion and overstimulation of the insulin producing B-cells during fetal life. In later life, a reduced insulin secretion is found. <b>Intra-uterine</b> growth restriction is present in severe maternal diabetes associated with vasculopathy. <b>Intra-uterine</b> growth restriction is associated with low insulin secretion and reduced development of the insulin receptors. In later life, these alterations can induce insulin resistance. The long-term consequences of an abnormal <b>intra-uterine</b> environment are of primary importance world-wide. Concentrated efforts are needed to explore how these long-term effects can be prevented. Fetal growth and development are partly determined by the fetal genome, but the genetic regulation of fetal growth is influenced by different factors, which can exert a stimulatory or an inhibitory effect. Fetal growth is dependent on the capacity of the mother to supply nutrients and also o...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study endocervical swabs from women {{classified}} in three groups were taken. The groups were {{women who had been}} on <b>intra-uterine</b> contraceptive devices for at least two months and experiencing vaginal discharge noticed visibly or through the use of speculum (n= 16); first control subjects which were women who had been on <b>intra-uterine</b> contraceptive devices for at least two months but not experiencing vaginal discharges (n= 14) and a second control subjects which were women who had never been on contraception (n= 2). Candida albicans, Neisseria gonorrhea, Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli were pathogens isolated within the experimental group (n= 16). Lactobacilli and Candida albicans were isolated in the first control subjects (n= 14). No microbial growth was observed within subjects of the second control group (n= 2). Statistical analysis indicated that only 25 % of the experimental subjects showed evidence of infection while 14. 3 % of women within the first control subjects (n= 14) were infected. Since the establishment that infection occurring in less than one month of <b>intra-uterine</b> contraceptive device implant can be meaningfully ascribed to the presence of the <b>intra-uterine</b> contraceptive device, it is recommended that cases of women implanted with <b>intra-uterine</b> contraceptive devices, experiencing vaginal discharges and irritation should be thoroughly investigated before prescription of drugs by physicians...|$|E

A group of 147 infants with elevated IgM values (≥ 19. 0 mg. / 100 ml.) were compared with 92 unselected newborn infants with normal IgM values. One infant with clinically unsuspected congenital rubella was detected in the study group while no cases of <b>intra-uterine</b> infection were found among the controls.

While it is recognized that infants with cord blood IgM levels truly in excess of 30 mg. / 100 ml. may represent a high-risk group with respect to proved or subclinical <b>intra-uterine</b> infection, it is concluded that routine cord blood screening for elevated IgM values is not a high-yield procedure for the detection of <b>intra-uterine</b> infection in our population...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Misoprostol and {{sulprostone}} are prostaglandins {{that can}} be used for the termination of second and third trimester pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of both agents for the termination of second and third trimester pregnancy in cases of congenital or genetic abnormalities, and for the induction of labour in cases of <b>intra-uterine</b> foetal death. STUDY DESIGN: We collected data from all women who had been treated with misoprostol in the second or third trimester of pregnancy between January 2001 and July 2002 in cases of congenital or genetic abnormalities, and for the induction of labour in cases of <b>intra-uterine</b> foetal death. In cases where the foetus was alive, misoprostol was usually (77 %) combined with mifepristone. Women were matched to women who had been treated with sulprostone for termination of second and third trimester pregnancy before 2001. We matched for hospital, previous vaginal delivery, <b>intra-uterine</b> death and duration of pregnancy. The primary outcome measure was time to delivery. RESULTS: Since the treatment effect was different in patients in whom labour was induced for <b>intra-uterine</b> death and patients in whom labour was induced while the foetus was alive, the analysis was stratified for this parameter. In 94 patients with <b>intra-uterine</b> death, there was no significant difference in time to delivery, blood loss, operative removal of the placenta and need for pain relief between misoprostol and sulprostone. In vital pregnancy (n = 96), time to delivery was significantly shorter in the misoprostol group. The relative risk for haemorrhage exceeding 1000 ml in this group was 0. 40 (95 % confidence interval, CI, 0. 13 - 1. 2). We observed no significant differences with respect to operative removal of the placenta or need for pain relief. CONCLUSION: In cases of <b>intra-uterine</b> death, the effectiveness of misoprostol for termination of pregnancy is comparable to that of sulprostone. In vital pregnancy, combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is more effective than sulprostone alon...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{biology of}} Dromiciops gliroides is described from five females collected during spring (October, De-cember 1984) in southern continental Chile. Developmental morphology of <b>intra-uterine</b> embryos (October litters) was examined by microscopic analysis and compared with morphological attributes of 8 pouched young (December litters). <b>Intra-uterine</b> embryos demonstrate ontogenetic features characteristic of altricial neonates, which migrate from the urogenital {{opening to the}} marsupium in order to complete the later stages of development. D. gliroides apparently is a monoestrus, seasonal breeder producing one litter per year. Maximum recorded litter size is four, with birth occurring in early spring (October). The life cycle of D. gliroides is subdivided into seven distinct periods: pair formation, <b>intra-uterine</b> development, parturition, intra-marsupium development, nocturnal family excursions, and juvenile independence. Phylo-genetic relationships of D. gliroides to Neotropical and Autralian marsupials are considered by comparing aspects of reproductive biology and early life history characteristics...|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] the fetal heart rate was being monitored in 16 378 patients during labour, <b>intra-uterine</b> death occurred in 13 cases (0, 08 %). These fetuses had birth weights of more than 1 000 g. In one patient monitoring was discontinued long before delivery, and fetal death occurred when a partially dilated cervis prevented quick delivery of the fetus which presented by the breech. In all the remaining patients an abnormal fetal heart rate pattern preceded <b>intra-uterine</b> death. Fetal death was probably unavoidable in 4 patients, even with monitoring. Abnormal fetal heart rate patterns were recorded in 2 of these, but the fetuses were estimated as being {{too small to be}} delivered by caesarean section. However, they weighed 1 160 g and 1 120 g. The 3 rd patient had severe fetal bradycardia on admission and <b>intra-uterine</b> death occurred soon afterwards.
