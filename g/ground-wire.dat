60|$|But the Dipsey had sailed in such devious {{ways and}} in so many {{directions}} that she had laid {{a great deal of}} the cable upon the bottom of the polar sea, and it would be difficult, or perhaps impossible, to sail back over her previous tracks and take it up again; and there was not enough of it left for her to proceed southward very far and still keep up her telegraphic communication. Consequently it was considered best, upon starting southward, that they should cut loose from all connection with their friends and the rest of the world. They would have to do this anyway in a short time. If they left the end of the wire in some suitable position on the coast of the polar sea, it might prove of subsequent advantage to science, whereas if they cut loose when they were submerged in the ocean, this cable from Cape Tariff to the pole must always be absolutely valueless. It was therefore determined to build a little house, for which they had the material, and place therein a telegraph instrument connected with the wire, and provided with one of the Collison batteries, which would remain in working order with a charge sufficient to last for forty years, and this, with a <b>ground-wire</b> run down through the ice to the solid earth, might make telegraphic communication possible to some subsequent visitor to the pole.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, Furukawa Electric Company {{developed}} a product explicitly for installation on the earth-wire of transmission lines, {{and this was}} reflected in the name: <b>Ground-Wire</b> Wrapped Optical cable. The first installation was carried out in 1985 on a 275kV transmission line owned by Chubu Electric Power and included a remote controlled pulling device and a self-compensating counterbalance on the wrapping machine. These are both necessary technologies for successful wrapped cable installation on the ground wire of long-span HV transmission lines.|$|E
5000|$|Cheater plugs were {{previously}} available {{with a short}} flexible grounding wire rather than a screw tab. This allows use of the second duplex outlet {{that does not have}} a faceplate screw in the correct location for the screw tab. The grounding wire would be wrapped around the adapter to reach the faceplate screw. However, this <b>ground-wire</b> style of cheater plug was discontinued when it was noted that a loose unattached grounding wire could by accident become inserted into the [...] "hot" [...] blade socket of a nearby outlet, potentially leading to electrocution.|$|E
60|$|Under his direction, {{and with}} his help, they {{arranged}} the instruments and the batteries, sunk the <b>ground-wires,</b> and, in a general way, put the office-apparatus in working order. When night came, there were still some things that remained {{to be done in}} the two stations, but the main part of the office arrangements had been satisfactorily concluded, under Mr. Lyons's supervision.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{variants}} of wrapped {{optical fibre cable}} systems for installation on overhead electricity power lines: they differ {{in the nature of}} the host conductor. When the host conductor is a phase-wire, one of the conductors that carry the electric current in the electricity network, a phase-to-ground insulator is required at every location where the wrapped cable leaves the conductor. The phase-to-ground (PTG) insulator is a device that provides electrical isolation whilst allowing optical continuity. This means that the fibre optic cable and joint closures on the grounded side of the PTG can be accessed and worked on safely, even if the overhead line is energised to full system voltage. The simpler system is designed to be installed on the earth-wire (also known as <b>ground-wire</b> or shield wire) of the overhead line. Because earth-wires are not energised in service, this type of installation does not require a phase-to-ground insulator.|$|E
50|$|By 1995, {{several other}} {{companies}} {{had entered the}} wrapped cable market: in Europe, British Insulated Callender's Cables (BICC) (in UK) introduced a product called Fibwrap' and Alcatel subsidiary IKO Kabel of Sweden marketed GWWOP under license from Furukawa. In Japan, GWWOP development had become a joint effort involving Sumitomo Electric Industries, Hitachi Cables, Furukawa Electric and Fujikura companies {{and each of the}} 4 companies supplied their own slightly different wrapped cable systems to power utilities in the domestic Japanese market. BICC also had a technology licence from Furukawa, but carried out extensive development work to make the product suitable for the European market: BICC re-designed the cable to use loose-tube technology and so provide a zero-strain environment for the optical fibres at all operating conditions of the overhead line; the tug and wrapping machine were re-designed to reduce the overall load on the conductor during the installation process. This included the use of a light-weight (but very costly) carbon-fibre cable drum in order to maximise the length of cable in a fixed payload weight. Being derived from GWWOP, both the BICC and Alcatel systems were limited to <b>ground-wire</b> installations and no phase-conductor installations were carried out.|$|E
5000|$|Wrapped {{optical fibre}} cable {{technology}} was developed independently in the UK and Japan in the early 1980s. In the UK, Raychem Ltd had a background in polymeric materials with resistance to high voltage environments; used for example in heat-shrinkable 33kV cable terminations and in polymer insulators. The initial development involved an all-dielectric fibre optic cable with a sheath made from tracking resistant material. The first installation was carried out on a 33kV overhead distribution line between sub-stations at Hartley and Goudhurst in Kent, UK in December 1982.The choice of a 33kV line indicates the expected market for the technology - building communication networks over local distribution lines when transmission and sub-transmission lines {{were expected to be}} equipped with OPGW. Over the next five years, installations were carried out in Norway, New Zealand, USA, India, Germany, France and Finland totalling about 180 km in both <b>ground-wire</b> and phase-conductor installations, and on both distribution and transmission lines. Raychem sold the wrapped {{optical fibre cable}} technology to Cookson Group plc in 1987. A subsidiary of Cookson Group was FOCAS Limited who completed the development work and commercialised the product as SkyWrap, supplying more than 16,000 km to customers in over 30 countries. FOCAS was acquired by AFL in 2000 ...|$|E
50|$|The {{golden eagle}} is not {{threatened}} at the species level but efforts {{need to be}} taken to prevent extinctions from many northern countries. The primary efforts undertaken to conserve the species have been, in order of prevalence from highest to lowest: conservation education and awareness, policy protection, directed land management, legislation and law enforcement and the provision of indentures. In Scotland, only 3 out of 16 regions in Scotland occupied by golden eagles since 1982 have been deemed favorable for conservation status, based upon the extent of local persecution, prey abundance and habitat change. The United Kingdom has put in place deterrent legislation to prevent behavior around the nest with the potential to cause harm and acts of willful harm to white-tailed eagles and some have advocated using the same policies for golden eagles. Education in this region mainly is undertaken by the Royal Society for Protection of Birds (RSPB). To curb the destructive practice of afforestation, some locals have switched to planting native Caledonian pine forests instead, likely resulting in much less harm to the native fauna possibly including golden eagles. While conservation efforts in Scotland have previously included the setting aside Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), these are usually too small to benefit golden eagles. More recently, the United Kingdom government has instead taken from governmental policies enacted in Continental Europe the idea of Special Protection Areas (SPAs), which offers strong legal protection of single species. Potentially more than 7000 km2 may be set aside in Scotland as SPA for golden eagles. Some education of mountain-climbers in country holding breeding golden eagles has been undertaken by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland. Within the United States, the golden eagle is legally protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. In the United States, many studies of the effects of industrialization and development have been undertaken by the very companies attempting to develop near areas holding golden eagles, in order to understand and hopefully minimize harmful effects. For example, Swan Falls electric power-plant in southern Idaho has funded research into the effects of reconstruction activities on breeding raptors (including the golden eagles), the Arch Mineral Corporation has funded studies attempting to test and successfully relocate golden eagle nests and KENETECH Windpower and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have funded research into the effects of turbine-based wind energy on golden eagles. In the 1970s in the United States, bounds were made {{to reduce the number of}} golden eagles to die from electrocution and wire-collisions. The primary change has been to raise the central insulator more than 1 m above the cross-arm and to position the <b>ground-wire</b> at a lower height on the pole, both likely to reduce the probability of golden eagles striking the wires with their wings. Also, the power company may place an insulating tube from 1 to 2 m on either side of the pole attachment or, especially if the previous modifications are not feasible, install raised perches at the top of the power pole. In Spain, the issue of electrocutions is more intractable because all pylons were made out of metal, which makes them much more dangerous to wildlife flying into them.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the necessity of transposition {{in the construction of}} overhead transmission lines. Line currents, line voltages and line losses of both the transposed and untransposed lines were calculated and compared for two different voltage classes. The conventional method of symmetrical components was used to determine both the negative- and zero-sequence currents produced by the inductive and capacitive unbalance in the untransposed lines. Both system voltages and line currents are affected when a transmission line is not transposed. This {{is a result of the}} two phenomena, (1) electromagnetic fields, and (2) electrostatic fields. To account for these effects, the transmission was modeled with a nominal-T network. The conductor configuration represented a single circuit, three-phase, three conductor system with a flat horizontal spacing. Shielding was represented by two <b>ground-wire</b> conductors. The necessary iterative calculations were performed on a digital computer. The unbalance generated by 100 miles of unbalanced line at a nominal voltage of either 230 Kv or 500 Kv did not produce an unbalance factor that exceeded the limits imposed by electrical machinery operation. The major effect of line unbalance is the influence of zero-sequence quantities on relaying systems and the additional power loss of the transmission lines. Both of these are functions of the length of the untransposed line. The calculated unbalance factors for 100 miles of untransposed lines are 0. 0474 and 0. 0626 for the 230 Kv and 500 Kv lines respectively. The above factors include the effect of the terminating equipment, transformers and equivalent machinery. Curves are presented to illustrate the phase currents, phase voltage drops, and the difference in transmission line power losses as functions of the length of the transposed and untransposed lines, for each voltage level...|$|E
