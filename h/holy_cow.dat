25|$|In Indian religion, late Vedic rituals {{developed}} {{involving the}} anointing of government officials, worshippers, and idols. These are {{now known as}} abhisheka. The practice spread to Indian Buddhists. In modern Hinduism and Jainism, anointment is common, although the practice typically employs water or yoghurt, milk, or (particularly) butter from the <b>holy</b> <b>cow,</b> rather than oil. Many devotees are anointed {{as an act of}} consecration or blessing at every stage of life, with rituals accompanying birthing, educational enrollments, religious initiations, and death. New buildings, houses, and ritual instruments are anointed, and some idols are anointed daily. Particular care is taken in such rituals to the direction of the smearing. People are anointed from head to foot, downwards. The water may derive from one of the holy rivers or be scented with saffron, turmeric, or flower infusions; the waste water produced when cleaning certain idols or when writing certain verses of scripture may also be used. Ointments may include ashes, clay, powdered sandalwood, or herbal pastes.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Holy</b> <b>Cows</b> are a {{robotics}} team co-founded by High Tech High engineering teacher David Berggren and his father, Bill Berggren in 2004. The team runs like a business, {{with students}} fulfilling roles including student directors, managers, and supervisors of various departments. Students are mentored by local engineering experts, including <b>Holy</b> <b>Cows</b> alumnus Jon Jock of Seabotix, to accrue skills {{through the building}} of robots. In alignment with the High Tech High mission, they also learn to manage projects as a team. The <b>Holy</b> <b>Cows</b> have traveled to the First Robotics World Championship eight times, as of 2013 and won the top prize, the Chairman’s Award, in 2013. The team also mentors other robotics teams and offers workshops. In 2014, the <b>Holy</b> <b>Cows</b> and their robot were one of five robotics teams that opened the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.|$|R

2500|$|Hedgewar {{was a key}} Congress {{worker in}} Nagpur {{during the time of}} the Lucknow Pact in 1916. In the 1920 Congress session in Nagpur, Hedgewar {{organised}} a group of volunteers whose uniform would later be adopted as the official RSS uniform. Like other followers of Lokamnya Tilak in Nagpur, Hedgewar was opposed to some of the programmes adopted by Gandhi. His stance on the Khilafat issue was a cause of concern for Hedgewar, and so was the fact that the protection of the <b>holy</b> <b>cow</b> was not on the Congress’ agenda. This led many, especially Tilakities, and others concerned about the protection of the Hindu community in India to part ways with Gandhi. Hedgewar consequently delivered a series of lectures in Maharashtra on the same and deliberately broke the law, sending him to prison for a duration of a year.|$|E

2500|$|By 1984, {{the term}} [...] "{{positive}} punk" [...] was outdated, and the tribal positive punk bands, the various bands from the Batcave scene, {{as well as}} the bands from Leeds (such as the Sisters of Mercy, the March Violets and Red Lorry Yellow Lorry) some of which used drum machines, had all come to be referred to as [...] "gothic" [...] or gothic rock. The same year, California deathrock band Kommunity FK toured with UK gothic rock band Sex Gang Children (and the following year with Alien Sex Fiend) which continued the trend in which American and British movements intermixed. Influenced more by the British scene and less by California, deathrock bands began to form {{in other parts of the}} United States, such as Samhain (1983) in Lodi, New Jersey; <b>Holy</b> <b>Cow</b> (1984) in Boston, Massachusetts (and later Providence, Rhode Island); Gargoyle Sox (1985) in Detroit, Michigan; and Shadow of Fear (1985) in Cleveland, Ohio. The fertile New York scene featured Scarecrow (1983), Of a Mesh (1983), Chop Shop (1984), Fahrenheit 451 (1984), the Naked and the Dead (1985), Brain Eaters (1986), the Children's Zoo (1986), the Plague (1987) and the Ochrana (1987).|$|E

60|$|The {{one thing}} {{now in his}} mind was further {{information}} as to the Red Bull. For aught he knew, and Kim's limitations were as curious and sudden as his expansions, the men, the nine hundred thorough devils of his father's prophecy, might pray to the beast after dark, as Hindus pray to the <b>Holy</b> <b>Cow.</b> That at least would be entirely right and logical, and the padre with the gold cross would be therefore the man to consult in the matter. On the other hand, remembering sober-faced padres whom he had avoided in Lahore city, the priest might be an inquisitive nuisance who would bid him learn. But {{had it not been}} proven at Umballa that his sign in the high heavens portended War and armed men? Was he not the Friend of the Stars as well as of all the World, crammed to the teeth with dreadful secrets? Lastly--and firstly as the undercurrent of all his quick thoughts--this adventure, though he did not know the English word, was a stupendous lark--a delightful continuation of his old flights across the housetops, as well as the fulfilment of sublime prophecy. He lay belly-flat and wriggled towards the Mess-tent door, a hand on the amulet round his neck.|$|E

It was not till after dinner that I {{discovered}} some one had cut {{a square foot}} of velvet from the centre of my best camera-cloth. This made me so angry that I wandered down the valley {{in the hope of}} meeting the big brown bear. I could hear him grunting like a discontented pig in the poppy-field, and I waited shoulder deep in the dew-dripping Indian corn to catch him after his meal. The moon was at full and drew out the rich scent of the tasselled crop. Then I heard the anguished bellow of a Himalayan cow, one of the little black crummies no bigger than Newfoundland dogs. Two shadows that looked like a bear and her cub hurried past me. I was in act to fire when I saw that they had each a brilliant red head. The lesser animal was trailing some rope behind it that left a dark track on the path. They passed within six feet of me, and the shadow of the moonlight lay velvet-black on their faces. Velvet-black was exactly the word, for by all the powers of moonlight they were masked in the velvet of my camera cloth! I marvelled and went to bed. Next morning the Kingdom was in uproar. Namgay Doola, men said, had gone forth in the night and with a sharp knife had cut off the tail of a cow belonging to the rabbit-faced villager who had betrayed him. It was sacrilege unspeakable against the <b>Holy</b> <b>Cow.</b> The State desired his blood, but he had retreated into his hut, barricaded the doors and windows with big stones, and defied the world.|$|E

40|$|In this chapter, Ekkehart Schlicht works {{outwards}} from a psycho-logical {{process towards}} an economic analysis of religion. Humans have {{a desire to}} understand themselves, the world around them, and to evaluate and justiq their actions. This 'quest for sense' leads to specialisation in religious activity and {{to the formation of}} religious organisations. Schlicht explains in which sense it is appropriate to apply economic principles of analysis to the under-standing of organised religion. From this perspective, various aspects of religious organisation can be analysed, such as ownership structure, the product mix offered by the churches, the pricing of religious services, the market structure, and quality competition. Some phenomena, such as the prohibition of the selling of indul-gences, <b>holy</b> <b>cows,</b> or male and female circumcision, pose obsta-cles to economic reasoning and suggest that religious interpretation or, more generally, the 'quest for sense', should be seen as an independent driving force that works in conjunction with other forces to shape societal phenomena...|$|R
