Madonna also roundly attacked O'Connor in the press for the incident, telling the Irish Times: [...] "I think there is a better way to present her ideas rather than ripping up an image that means a lot to other people."

[...] and [...] "Perfect Day", which were co-composed with Persson; Fredriksson co-wrote the music to one of the album's louder rock songs, [...] "Hotblooded", and is the sole composer of ballad [...] "Watercolors in the Rain".

6000|$|... "Oh; {{just the}} old story, mother, I suppose. What {{she said was}} what I knew just as well before I went there. But yet it was {{necessary}} that I <b>should</b> hear what <b>she</b> had to say;--and as necessary <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> hear me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've not the {{slightest}} objection to her being married. I hope she will, with all my heart. <b>I</b> certainly <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have her husband after buying him at such a price. I suppose Lord Fawn won't forbid the banns." [...] These last words were only whispered to her next neighbour, Lord Chiltern; but poor Lord Fawn saw the whisper, and was aware {{that it must have}} had reference to his condition.|$|R

60|$|February 6.--Was at Court till two; {{afterwards}} wrote a good deal, {{which has}} become a habit with me. Dined at Sir John Hay's, where met the Advocate and a pleasant party. There had been a Justiciary trial yesterday, in which something curious had occurred. A woman of rather the better class, a farmer's wife, had been tried on the 5th for poisoning her maid-servant. There seems to have been little doubt of her guilt, but the motive was peculiar. The unfortunate girl had an intrigue with her son, which this Mrs. Smith (I think that is the name) was desirous to conceal, from some ill-advised puritanic notions, and also for fear of her husband. She could find no better way of hiding the shame than giving the girl (with her own knowledge and consent, I believe) potions to cause abortion, which she afterwards changed for arsenic, as the more effectual silencing medicine. In the course of the trial one of the jury fell down in an epileptic fit, and on his recovery was far too much disordered to permit the trial to proceed. With only fourteen jurymen it was impossible to go on. But the Advocate, Sir William Rae, says she shall be tried anew, since she has not tholed an assize. Sic Paulus ait--et recte quidem. But, having been half tried, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have some benefit of it, as far as saving her life, if convicted on the second indictment. The Advocate declares, however, she shall be hanged, as certainly she deserves. But it looks something like hanging up a man who has been recovered by the surgeons, which has always been accounted harsh justice.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{if it did}} {{not hurt}} her then, why should it hurt her again? There's old General M'Kinnon, my father's old friend, who runs about {{everywhere}} in a wheeled-chair with a leg-rest; and <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> why <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not do the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; disgraced. Mark you; I do not {{say that}} she has been disgraced; and pray do not suppose it {{possible}} that <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> so. But a great opprobrium has been thrown on her name, and it would be better, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> remain at home till she has cast it off from her. Even for myself, I feel it almost wrong to be here; nor would I have come had I known when I did come as much as I do know now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For me personally, none. Were she {{much worse}} than <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> is, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not care in the least for myself, if I thought that we were doing her good,--helping to bring her back. She can't hurt me. I am so fixed, and dry, and established, that nothing anybody says will affect me. But mamma doesn't like it." ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Ball had {{not done}} her work well. It was not within her power to induce Margaret to renounce her engagement, and had she known her niece better, I {{do not think that}} she would have made the attempt. She did succeed in {{learning}} that Margaret had received no renewal of an offer from her son,--that there was, in fact, no positive engagement now existing between them; and with this, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have been satisfied. Margaret had declared that she demanded nothing from her cousin, and with this assurance Lady Ball should have been contented. But she had thought to carry her point, to obtain the full swing of her will, by means of a threat, and had forgotten that in the very words of her own menace she conveyed to Margaret some intimation that her son was still desirous of doing that very thing which she was so anxious to prevent. There was no chance that her threat should have any effect on Margaret. She ought to have known that the tone of the woman's mind was much too firm for that. Margaret knew--was as sure of it as any woman could be sure--that her cousin was bound to her by all ties of honour. She believed, too, that he was bound to her by love, and that if he should finally desert it, he would be moved to do so by mean motives. It was no anger on the score of Mr Maguire that would bring him to such a course, no suspicion that she was personally unworthy of being his wife. Our Griselda, with all her power of suffering and willingness to suffer, understood all that, and was by no means disposed to give way to any threat from Lady Ball.|$|E
50|$|Wallace says he {{was unhappy}} with the casting:Diane Cilento tried to play working-class, but it just didn't work. Robyn Nevin wanted to play that part, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have. Jason Connery was very young then {{and he was very}} nervous about the film and thought it would ruin his image, and he was never very {{friendly}} to me. He did the film, but he thought I was ruining his career.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Season Finale" [...] {{was about}} entertainment, {{performance}} reviews and announcement of results. Irwin performed [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] {{with the famous}} country singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. [...] After the song, Swift was asked, based on her experience as a teenage Country Music singer, what advice she would offer to Irwin. In reply, Swift commented:... She Irwin has such an adorable personality, and that's {{so much of the}} battle right there. You know, being so endearing and so so humble. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> just stay who she is. I think she's got it.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{commentators}} in Britain supported Padel, attributing the smear {{campaign in}} the media to misogyny and networking. [...] "The old boys have closed in on her", the poet Jackie Kay stated. On Newsnight Review the poet Simon Armitage and poetry writer Josephine Hart expressed regret about Padel's resignation. [...] "Ruth's a good person", Armitage said. [...] "She dipped a toe in the media whirlpool and it dragged her down. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have resigned, <b>she</b> would have been good." [...] The election was for a post beginning {{the first day of}} Michaelmas Term 2009 hence Padel did not take up office. In the 2010 election she supported Geoffrey Hill.|$|R
6000|$|You {{will have}} {{inferred}} something {{of all this}} from what I have written of her before, and from words of hers that I have reported to you. Do you think it so wonderful, then, that in the joy I felt at the hope, the solace, which my story of our life seemed to give her, <b>she</b> <b>should</b> {{become more and more}} precious to me? It was not wonderful, either, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> identify me with that hope, that solace, and should suffer herself to lean upon me, in a reliance infinitely sweet and endearing. But what a fantastic dream it now appears! ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{memorial}} service {{was held for}} her at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge, London on 27 September 2012 at which Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes led the tributes. He said [...] "If {{there was one thing}} she was superb at, it was friendship. And not just sympathetic friendship, but hard-working, useful, practical assistance. <b>She</b> was anxious, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not be defined, entirely, as the star of a popular series, as one half of a golden couple, as a mother and hostess, although she excelled in all of these. She wanted also to be remembered as a serious actress whose early career might have gone on to greatness had she not made the personal decision to change direction having a family." ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2015, Kasich {{commented on}} the highly publicized case of Kim Davis (the Rowan County, Kentucky clerk who refused {{to comply with a}} federal court order {{directing}} her to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples), saying: [...] "Now, I respect the fact that this lady doesn't agree but she's also a government employee, she's not running a church, I wouldn't force this on a church. But in terms of her responsibility I think she has to comply. I don't think —I don't like the fact that she's sitting in a jail, that's absurd as well. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> follow the law." ...|$|E

5000|$|Since 2004, Hewitt has {{remained}} inactive {{in the music}} industry, but she released the compilation albums Cool with You: The Platinum Collection (2006) in Asia and Hey Everybody (2007) in Brazil. In 2009, reports surfaced that Hewitt was planning on making a country album {{and was in the}} process of writing material for it. Jamie Kennedy, Hewitt's boyfriend at the time, said: [...] "I really want to make her a new demo for her music, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> do singing again. She's so good." [...] However, nothing has of yet come of the reports. Hewitt {{has remained}} mostly absent from the music industry, but in 2013, she recorded a cover of [...] "I'm a Woman" [...] to promote the second season of The Client List and shot a music video for the song, which reached the top ten in the iTunes Music Video chart.|$|E

2500|$|Sonya is {{an animal}} lover who has {{previously}} worked for Guide Dogs Victoria. She is good-hearted and relished {{her role as}} a trainer. A writer for Network Ten's Neighbours website described Sonya has having a shady past and wanting to set up a new life for herself in Erinsborough. Sonya used to have alcohol, drug and gambling addictions, but she has worked hard to overcome them. Morey told a reporter from Channel 5 that she is similar to Sonya morally and ethically, plus they both want the best for the people they love. However, Sonya occasionally goes about things in a way in which Morey said she did not understand. The actress also struggled to understand the place of darkness that Sonya has been in too. When asked if her character could ever escape her past, Morey replied [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> will every truly escape her past because ultimately <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should.</b> If <b>she</b> doesn't have it there as a reminder and a good motivator to help her stay on track." [...] Morey revealed she would like to see Sonya reach her potential as a mother in the future.|$|R
6000|$|How master {{bore the}} news, {{when he first}} heard it, is more than I can tell, not having been present. When I did see him he looked awfully {{overcome}} by it, to be sure. He sat quiet in a corner, with his fat hands hanging over his thick knees, and his head down, and his eyes looking at nothing. He seemed not so much sorry, as scared and dazed like, by what had happened. My mistress managed all {{that was to be}} done about the funeral. It must have cost a sight of money--the coffin, in particular, being most beautiful. The dead lady's husband was away, as we heard, in foreign parts. But my mistress (being her aunt) settled it with her friends in the country (Cumberland, <b>I</b> <b>think)</b> that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be buried there, in the same grave along with her mother. Everything was done handsomely, in respect of the funeral, I say again, and master went down to attend the burying in the country himself. He looked grand in his deep mourning, with his big solemn face, and his slow walk, and his broad hatband--that he did! ...|$|R
50|$|Wallace made {{a series}} of feature films. His first short feature film was The Love Letters from Teralba Road (1977). His feature directorial debut took place with Stir in 1980, a film based on incarceration and a {{subsequent}} Royal Commission. The film proved popular and Wallace stated that it made a profit. In 1984, Wallace directed The Boy Who Had Everything. Wallace's experience of this film was to be one of his first difficult encounters within the directing field; he was unhappy with the casting and found one of the actors hard to work with:Diane Cilento tried to play working-class, but it just didn't work. Robyn Nevin wanted to play that part, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have. Jason Connery was very young then and he was very nervous about the film and thought it would ruin his image, and he was never very friendly to me.

She composed its music using lyrics which were written several years prior by Gessle, who expressed interest in the pair composing this way more regularly on future material, saying: [...] "When it's happening like that writing lyrics and Marie composing music, it makes Roxette even better because it widens up what we can do, what kind of music we can make, even more.

[...] Her limited input in the songwriting of Roxette material stemmed from difficulty with writing English lyrics: she has said that it [...] "feels very strange to write in another language."

5000|$|When {{asked how}} she, as an advisor, {{would change the}} first lady's image if asked for a consultation, Smith replied: [...] "I would tell her not to change her image, actually.

[...] Her answer impressed the judges, giving her once again the highest scores, the crown, the prizes and the prestigious title. She became the seventh woman from her state to hold the Miss USA title and also won the Miss Congeniality award as she had at her state pageant, becoming the only Miss USA winner and Miss Texas USA in history to win this award.|$|R
6000|$|Though I {{hung back}} with an awkwardness that was really unfeigned, yet when she so readily left me I thought {{it was not so}} kind, and <b>I</b> began to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have pressed me still on to it; so foolishly {{backward}} are we to the thing which, of all the world, we most desire; mocking ourselves with a feigned reluctance, when the negative would be death to us. But she was too cunning for me; for while I, as it were, blamed her in my mind for not carrying me to him, though, at the same time, I appeared backward to see him, on a sudden she unlocks the folding-doors, which looked into the next parlour, and throwing them open. [...] "There," [...] says she (ushering him in), [...] "is the person who, I suppose, thou inquirest for;" [...] and the same moment, with a kind decency, she retired, and that so swift that she would not give us leave hardly to know which way she went.|$|R

5000|$|The {{character}} of Sarah was originally {{written into the}} show as a potential love interest for established character, Craig Valentine (Renato Bartolomei). Sarah's first scene involved her crashing into Craig's car, driven by his son Jake Valentine (Calum Gittins). Upon learning Sarah was trying {{for a job in}} his department, Craig opposed to her job application, nonetheless, CEO Andrew Solomon (Paolo Rotondo) hired her. Throughout Sarah's early scenes, she often interacted with Craig and a sense of chemistry and potential romance was established between them. Billing offered an opinion as to why the two had such good chemistry saying; [...] "I think you can find someone physically attractive but hate their guts, someone can irritate you heaps but you still find them a lovable rogue. The two characters are a lot alike, and that's why they spar. They're both headstrong and think that they're right more often than not." [...] Following the two characters first kiss, the cast and crew reportedly fell quiet in awe. Billing agreed saying: [...] "We have monitors through the whole building and everyone was going, 'Bloody hell!' Their chemistry is quite extraordinary," [...] The two broke up due to Sarah's son Daniel (Jarred Blakiston) and Sarah became engaged to Andrew but after believing he had died in a plane crash, Sarah realized {{she was in love with}} Craig. Nonetheless when she found out Andrew had survived, she committed to marry him. Billing believed Sarah was: [...] "being a chicken .... She does love Andrew and she does have feelings for him but it's not really what she wants in her heart of hearts. There's a real risk that she is making a mistake, she will regret it and they will break up." [...] Bartolomei believed Craig would still love Sarah even if she were married, [...] "from Craig's point of view, he really loves (Sarah), whether he can have her or not. I think his love for her is so great that he would love her even if she married Andrew and lives happily ever after." [...] Even Rotondo believed Craig was a better suit, [...] "Andrew hasn't been set up as the ideal guy for her so definitely <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be with Craig." [...] Despite this, Sarah and Andrew married.|$|E
