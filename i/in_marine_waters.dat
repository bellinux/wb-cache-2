25|$|Elasmobranchs' {{ability to}} enter fresh water is limited because their blood is {{normally}} {{at least as}} salty (in terms of osmotic strength) as seawater through the accumulation of urea and trimethylamine oxide, but bull sharks living in fresh water show a significantly reduced concentration of urea within their blood. Despite this, the solute composition (i.e. osmolarity) of a bull shark in fresh water is still much {{higher than that of}} the external environment. This results in a large influx of water across the gills due to osmosis and loss of sodium and chloride from the shark's body. However, bull sharks in fresh water possess several organs with which to maintain appropriate salt and water balance; these are the rectal gland, kidneys, liver, and gills. All elasmobranchs have a rectal gland which functions in the excretion of excess salts accumulated as a consequence of living in seawater. Bull sharks in freshwater environments decrease the salt-excretory activity of the rectal gland, thereby conserving sodium and chloride./K+-ATPase activity in gill, rectal gland, kidney and intestine|journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B|year=2005|volume=175 |issue=1 |pages=37–44 |pmid=15565307|url=http://www.sciencecollege.com/sharklab/courses/elasmobiology/readings/pillans.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00360-004-0460-2}} The kidneys produce large amounts of dilute urine, but also {{play an important role in}} the active reabsorption of solutes into the blood. The gills of bull sharks are likely to be involved in the uptake of sodium and chloride from the surrounding fresh water, whereas urea is produced in the liver as required with changes in environmental salinity. Recent work also shows that the differences in density of fresh water to that of marine waters result in significantly greater negative buoyancies in sharks occupying fresh water, resulting in increasing costs of living in fresh water. Bull sharks caught in freshwater have subsequently been shown to have lower liver densities than sharks living <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> <b>waters.</b> This may reduce the added cost of greater negative buoyancy.|$|E

40|$|The Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{establishes}} Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> for 34 priority substances. Among these substances, 25 are hydrophobic and bioaccumulable (2 {{metals and}} 23 organic compounds). For these 25 substances, monitoring in water matrix {{is not appropriate}} and an alternative matrix should be developed. Bivalve mollusks, particularly mussels (Mytilus edulis, Mytilus galloprovincialis), are used by Ifremer as a quantitative biological indicator since 1979 in France, to assess the <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> quality. This study {{has been carried out}} in order to determine thresholds in mussels at least as protective as EQS <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> laid down by the WFD. Three steps are defined: -	Provide an overview of knowledges about the relations between the concentrations of contaminants <b>in</b> the <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> and mussels through bioaccumulation factor (BAF) and bioconcentration factor (BCF). This allows to examine how a BCF or a BAF can be determined: BCF can be determined experimentally (according to US EPA or ASTM standards), or by Quantitative Activity-Structure Relationship models (QSAR) : four equations can be used for mussels. BAF can be determined by field experiment; but none standards exists. It could be determined by using QSAR but this method is considered as invalid for mussels, or by using existing model: Dynamic Budget Model, but this is complex to use. -	Collect concentrations data <b>in</b> <b>marine</b> <b>water</b> (Cwater) <b>in</b> bibliography for those 25 substances; and compare them with concentration in mussels (Cmussels) obtained through French monitoring network of chemicals contaminants (ROCCH) and biological integrator network RINBIO.

This study points out that experimental BCF data are available for 3 substances (Chlorpyrifos, HCH, Pentachlorobenzene). BCF by QSAR can be calculated for 20 substances. The use of field data allows to evaluate 4 BAF for organic compounds and 2 BAF for metals.
