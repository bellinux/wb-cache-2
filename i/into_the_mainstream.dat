5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made their way <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the NWOBHM {{had broken}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream,</b> as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, {{as well as}} Motörhead, reached the British top 10.

5|$|Badmotorfinger was {{released}} on September 24, 1991 through A Records. The album peaked at number 39 on the Billboard 200 album chart on February 29, 1992. It {{was released}} nearly one month after Pearl Jam's Ten and {{on the same day}} as Nirvana's Nevermind, all of which helped to break alternative rock and grunge <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b> Although overshadowed {{at the time of its}} release by the sudden popularity of Nirvana's Nevermind, the focus of attention brought by Nevermind to the Seattle scene helped Soundgarden gain wider attention. Badmotorfinger was among the 100 top selling albums of 1992. Badmotorfinger sold a million copies in the early 1990's, was certified platinum by the RIAA in January 1993 and certified double platinum in April 1996, signifying two million shipped copies.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, glam metal {{became popular}} with {{groups such as}} Mötley Crüe and Poison. Underground scenes {{produced}} an array of more aggressive styles: thrash metal broke <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> with bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, while other extreme subgenres of metal such as death metal and black metal remain subcultural phenomena. Since the mid-1990s popular styles have further expanded {{the definition of the}} genre. These include groove metal (with bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, and Lamb of God) and nu metal (with bands such as Korn, Slipknot, and Linkin Park), the latter of which often incorporates elements of grunge and hip hop.|$|E
5|$|Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 1992 album Dirty, which {{was released by}} DGC {{in the wake of}} Nirvana's breakthrough <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b> Dirty became one of the band's most commercially successful albums, selling around 500,000 copies worldwide as of May 1994. The album also reached No. 83 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. After Dirty, Sonic Youth decided to step away from major-label alternative rock acts, which singer and guitarist Thurston Moore thought the media associated the band with. Touring with indie rock bands like Pavement, Sebadoh, and Royal Trux inspired Sonic Youth to write a quieter and more subtle album.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the multifaceted {{problem of the}} Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) {{with a view to}} suggesting viable options to integrate tribal areas of Pakistan <b>into</b> <b>the</b> national <b>mainstream</b> and a role that can be played by information operations (IO) in achieving this integration. The paper discusses historical background and provides an overview of administrative, judicial, political, and socioeconomic aspects of issues and addresses impact of military operations within the area. The launching of military operations in the FATA after 9 / 11 became a necessity; their impact is discussed at length to determine remedies and applications of strategies and tools to achieve the smooth integration of <b>the</b> FATA <b>into</b> <b>the</b> national <b>mainstream.</b> In assessing underlying causes, this study suggests that a significant change to the status quo is essential and effective measures must be taken to initiate tribal area integration to safeguard wider national and international interests. The role of IO, i. e., non-kinetic, non-lethal options, to include application of tools and capabilities is analysed with respect to achieving FATA integration <b>into</b> <b>the</b> national <b>mainstream.</b> This research is focused on a more cohesive strategy of integration and future vision of integrating <b>the</b> FATA <b>into</b> <b>the</b> national <b>mainstream</b> by applying modern IO tools.

5|$|During {{the three}} months of his rule, Minh, his {{civilian}} Prime Minister Nguyen Ngoc Tho, and his leading military colleagues, Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Lê Văn Kim, attempted to defeat the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) non-militarily. They felt that a battleground victory was impractical or impossible and pursued a strategy of trying to politically integrate the insurgents <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b> This meant an intensification of rural non-military initiatives {{and a reduction in}} armed operations. This brought them into conflict with the United States, who had plans to start bombing North Vietnam. At the same time, in January 1964, the French government of President Charles de Gaulle proposed the neutralization of Vietnam and the withdrawal of American forces. Khánh and his fellow plotters exploited this to spread rumors that Minh's junta was about to make a deal with Hanoi and then gained the support of the US, most notably through the chief of military forces in Vietnam, General Paul Harkins, who supported Diệm and opposed Minh's November coup.|$|E
5|$|In March 1995, American Tejano music singer Selena {{was shot}} and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and former manager of the singer's boutiques. The impact of the singer's death had a {{negative}} impact on Latin music, her genre—which she catapulted it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> market—suffered and its popularity waned following Selena's death. She continued to be the last remaining Tejano recording artist to appear on the United States Billboard 200 chart since 2000. In the fall of 2011, Chilean record producer Humberto Gatica and Capitol Latin senior vice president Sergio Lopes had the idea of turning Selena's songs into duets in popular music genres. Mexican singers Cristian Castro, Samo, American singers Don Omar, Carlos Santana, Selena Gomez (who was named after Selena), and Spanish singer Juan Magan lent their voices for the duet/remix style album. The project—named Enamorada de Ti—was released in April 2012 and debuted and peaked at number one on the U.S. Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums chart. Lo Mejor de...Selena followed the commercial success of Enamorada de Ti, released on the twentieth anniversary of Selena's death. It was also made available for digital download and released as a double disc.|$|E
5|$|In November 1844, the {{anonymously}} published popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, {{written by}} Scottish journalist Robert Chambers, widened {{public interest in}} the concept of transmutation of species. Vestiges used evidence from the fossil record and embryology to support the claim that living things had progressed from the simple to the more complex over time. But it proposed a linear progression rather than the branching common descent theory behind Darwin's work in progress, and it ignored adaptation. Darwin read it soon after publication, and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists, including Adam Sedgwick, attacked its morality and scientific errors. Vestiges had significant influence on public opinion, and the intense debate helped {{to pave the way for}} the acceptance of the more scientifically sophisticated Origin by moving evolutionary speculation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream.</b> While few naturalists were willing to consider transmutation, Herbert Spencer became an active proponent of Lamarckism and progressive development in the 1850s.|$|E

5|$|Pearl Jam {{was formed}} in 1990 by bassist Jeff Ament, guitarist Stone Gossard, and guitarist Mike McCready, who then {{recruited}} vocalist Eddie Vedder and drummer Dave Krusen. The band signed to Epic Records in 1991. A {{few months after the}} completion of the band's debut studio album, Ten, drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band. Ten broke Pearl Jam <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream,</b> and became one of the best-selling alternative albums of the 1990s. Following an intense touring schedule, the band went into the studio to record what would become its second studio album, Vs. Upon its release, Vs. set the record for most copies of an album sold in a week, and spent five weeks {{at the top of the}} Billboard 200. Burdened by the pressures of success, Pearl Jam decided to decrease the level of promotion for its albums, including refusing to release music videos. In 1994, the band released its third studio album, Vitalogy, which became the band's third straight album to reach multi-platinum status.|$|E

5|$|Đính and {{the leading}} generals in the MRC {{also had a}} secret plan to end the {{communist}} insurgency, which called itself the National Liberation Front (NLF) and claimed to be independent {{of the government of}} North Vietnam. They claimed that most of them were first and foremost southern nationalists opposed to foreign military intervention and U.S. involvement and support of Diệm. The generals agreed with this viewpoint and thought that an agreement to end the war within South Vietnam was possible. The government also rebuffed American proposals to bomb North Vietnam on the grounds that such actions would cede the moral high ground, which they claimed on the basis of fighting in a purely defensive manner. However, the plans to bring the NLF <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
