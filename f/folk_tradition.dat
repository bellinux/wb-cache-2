5|$|The kont, or storytelling, <b>folk</b> <b>tradition</b> of Dominica {{was focused}} around {{entertainment}} for night-time festivals, funeral wakes and feasts and festivals.

5|$|Adverse weather {{such as a}} storm or hail could devastate crop {{fields and}} orchards, and thus {{jeopardize}} the livelihood of farmers in the affected area. A role of zduhaći, according to <b>folk</b> <b>tradition,</b> was to lead storms and hail clouds away from their family estates, villages, or regions, to save their crops. A zduhać could take the storms and hail clouds over the territory of another zduhać to destroy its crops. The other zduhać would fly up to confront the bringer of bad weather, {{and there would be}} a fight between the zduhaći.|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{interest}} in pantheism was whetted by the folkloristic studies of Alexander Afanasyev. That author's standard work, The Poetic Outlook on Nature by the Slavs, became Rimsky-Korsakov's pantheistic bible. The composer first applied Afanasyev's ideas in May Night, {{in which he}} helped fill out Gogol's story by using folk dances and calendar songs. He went further down this path in The Snow Maiden, where he made extensive use of seasonal calendar songs and khorovodi (ceremonial dances) in the <b>folk</b> <b>tradition.</b>|$|E

The earliest published photographs of the monument appeared in 1908, produced by George Clinch. In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Addington Long Barow alongside the other Medway Megaliths.|$|E

5|$|Italian folk {{styles are}} very diverse, and include monophonic, polyphonic, and responsorial song, choral, {{instrumental}} and vocal music, and other styles. Choral singing and polyphonic song forms are primarily found in northern Italy, while south of Naples, solo singing is more common, and groups usually use unison singing {{in two or}} three parts carried by a single performer. Northern ballad-singing is syllabic, with a strict tempo and intelligible lyrics, while southern styles use a rubato tempo, and a strained, tense vocal style. Folk musicians use the dialect of their own regional tradition; this rejection of the standard Italian language in folk song is nearly universal. There is little perception of a common Italian <b>folk</b> <b>tradition,</b> and the country's folk music never became a national symbol.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{cultural}} practices that were to define Merina social and political life for centuries are credited to Andrianjaka.

He consolidated power through such measures as appropriating the <b>folk</b> <b>tradition</b> of sampy (community talismans), thereby ensuring all the powers traditionally attributed to these idols were {{under the control of the}} sovereign alone. Merina traditions related to the burial and mourning of sovereigns are also traced back to Andrianjaka's reign.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the badnjak is {{explained}} by the events surrounding the Nativity of Jesus Christ. According to the Gospel of Luke , Mary Theotokos gave birth to Christ at Bethlehem, wrapped him in cloths and laid him in a manger. By Holy Tradition, the manger was located in a cave near that town. An angel of the Lord appeared {{to a group of}} shepherds who were keeping watch over their flock by night in that region, and told them that the Savior was born at Bethlehem. They went there and found the baby lying in the manger, as the angel described to them. By <b>folk</b> <b>tradition,</b> the shepherds brought firewood to the cave and built a fire to warm the newborn Christ and his mother throughout the night. The burning of the badnjak commemorates this event.|$|E
5|$|Music intertwines with {{aspects of}} American social and {{cultural}} identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race {{is perhaps the most}} potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an African American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the melting pot of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American <b>folk</b> <b>tradition</b> was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and yet has long been perceived as a form of white music.|$|E
