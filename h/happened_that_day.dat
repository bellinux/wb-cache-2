5|$|Monk's {{assistant}} Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) {{suspects that}} St. Claire's wife Miranda {{was the person}} who ordered her husband's assassination. Sharona's theory {{is supported by the}} fact that St. Claire is worth $150 million, but Monk thinks about other hypotheses, including one in which Miranda is having an affair with one of St. Claire's assistants. Things become clearer in Monk's mind when he watches a news report on the assassination attempt. Monk regroups everyone at the place of the campaign rally to recreate what <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
25|$|The play {{is still}} disputed by those involved, {{particularly}} by living personnel from the Raiders and their fans, who insist the Raiders should have won. Tatum {{said that the}} ball did not bounce off him, both immediately after the game as well as later; however, in his memoirs, Tatum equivocated, stating {{that he could not}} honestly say if the ball hit him. Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, who was covering Harris at the time, maintains that the ball hit Fuqua. Fuqua has been coy, supposedly saying he knows exactly what <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> but will never tell.|$|E
25|$|On the Batavian {{right wing}} of General Daendels, {{absolutely}} nothing <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> as the inundations made his lines impenetrable. There was a strange incident when the British General Don, under cover of a flag of truce, tried to get permission to cross the Batavian lines {{on a mission to}} the Batavian government. As on the Batavian left wing the battle had clearly started, Daendels considered this an abuse of the flag of truce. Besides, Don turned out to have papers on his person that could be considered to be of a seditious nature. Daendels therefore arrested Don as a spy and sent him to Brune's headquarters. Don was incarcerated in the fortress of Lille and only years later exchanged for the Irish rebel James Napper Tandy.|$|E

50|$|Set in Washington D.C, {{it takes}} place over twenty-four {{non-linear}} one-minute episodes, and it appears to take place during Day 4, as indicated by {{a reference to the}} Heller kidnapping by James Sutton <b>happening</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> The 24 minutes of the show do not happen in real time; instead each minute takes place at a different given time in the day.|$|R
50|$|Five Navajo men: men {{who died}} young of leukemia or another cancer, but were spared {{death on the}} day of the oil field explosion, being advised by Dillon Charley, their {{supervisor}} as roustabouts for that project, that something bad would <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> All carried amulets given as gifts by Vines. Roscoe Sam, Joseph Sam, Woody Begay, Rudolph Becenti, and Windy Tsossie are the five men.|$|R
500|$|The {{depiction}} of the police attempting {{to shut down the}} filming due to safety concerns actually happened during filming, just as seen in the video. Hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police. [...] According to Avis, the events depicted in the video show what actually <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> [...] "almost in real time", and that [...] "getting busted {{was an integral part of}} the plan." [...] Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to dramatize the music video, but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video. In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel, which was rebuilt to create some interest, in case no one showed up at the film shoot. Although the video is of a live performance, the audio used is from the studio-recorded version of the song. The video won the Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Years later Morrall said, [...] "I {{thought we}} would win handily. We'd only lost twice in our last 30 games. I'm still not sure what <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> at the Orange Bowl, however; it's still hard to account for." [...] Wrote Matt Snell, [...] "The most {{distinct}} image I have from that whole game is of Ordell Braase and some other guys—not so much Mike Curtis--having a bewildered look." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{is not a}} {{day that}} goes by that I do not feel remorse for what <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> in My Lai", he told members of the club. [...] "I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed, for their families, for the American {{soldiers}} involved and their families. I am very sorry....If you are asking why I did not stand up to them when I was given the orders, I will have to say that I was a 2nd lieutenant getting orders from my commander and I followed them—foolishly, I guess.|$|E

40|$|This is a keynote {{presentation}} {{given at}} the 50 th anniversary conference of the CILIP Library and Information History Group, CILIP HQ London, 6 November 2012. It took a presidential theme, in acknowledgement of the US presidential election <b>happening</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> It {{was intended as a}} short introduction to the <b>day,</b> showing <b>that</b> the study of information history is not incompatible with a concern for the future of information and the information professions...|$|R
2500|$|The RAF {{credited}} Brown with {{shooting down}} the Red Baron, {{but it is}} now generally agreed that the bullet which hit Richthofen was fired from the ground. Richthofen died following an extremely serious and inevitably fatal chest wound from a single bullet, penetrating from the right armpit and resurfacing next to the left nipple. Brown's attack was from behind and above, and from Richthofen's left. Even more conclusively, Richthofen could not have continued his pursuit of May {{for as long as}} he did (up to two minutes) had this wound come from Brown's guns. Brown himself never spoke much about what <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> claiming, [...] "There is no point in me commenting, as the evidence is already out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The {{fact that we had}} got so close to the Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long ago, you might think, but let me tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> really angered me. We played as though our lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back and we kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E

60|$|Nothing more of any {{importance}} <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> {{except the}} arrival of a letter from Paris, addressed to Lady Constance in Marmaduke's handwriting.

50|$|Many of the Tampicos crew wore {{bandages}} {{over their}} wounds from previous engagements. Beside Captain Malpica, the crew consisted an executive officer, a chief engineer, {{and an assistant}} engineer with three machinists. Twenty-nine sailors were aboard, with a reinforcement of twenty-five rebel soldiers, {{to make up for}} the missing Tampico crew members, for a total of sixty-one men. The American captain informed Malpica that a radio response from Howard was not likely to <b>happen</b> <b>that</b> <b>day,</b> so the U.S. sailors went back to their ship. Tampico would be sunk before the Americans received a response.|$|R
60|$|She {{felt that}} the end of her inspiring speech was a little weak, but she did not see how she could mend it. Her talk with Mr. Meadows on the {{telephone}} had left her as vague as before as to the actual details of what had been <b>happening</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> in Wall Street. She remembered stray remarks of his about bulls, and she had gathered <b>that</b> something had <b>happened</b> to something which Mr. Meadows called G.R.D.'s, which had evidently been {{at the root of the}} trouble; but there her grasp of high finance ended.|$|R
60|$|Even a Napoleon, however, may err {{from lack}} of {{sufficient}} information; {{and there was a}} flaw in her position of which she was unaware. From the beginning of the drive to the end of it Ruth had hardly spoken a word, and Mrs. Porter, in consequence, was still in ignorance of what had been <b>happening</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> in Wall Street and the effect of these happenings on her niece's outlook on life. Could she have known it, the silent girl beside her had already suffered the relapse which she had feared as a remote possibility.|$|R

6000|$|When {{the unfortunate}} Skinner {{got out of}} the South-Eastern train at Urshot that evening it was already nearly dusk. The train was late, but not inordinately late--and Mr. Skinner remarked as much to the station-master. Perhaps he saw a certain {{pregnancy}} in the station-master's eye. After the briefest hesitation and with a confidential movement of his hand to the side of his mouth he asked if [...] "anything" [...] had <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
60|$|Now he was {{explaining}} to Mr. Dove {{the political and}} social position among that people, whose cruel laws and customs led to constant fights on the part of tribes or families, who knew that they were doomed, and their consequent massacre if caught, as had <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b> Of course, the clergyman, who had lived for some years at Durban, knew that this was true, although, never having actually witnessed one of these dreadful events till now, he did not realise all their horror.|$|E

60|$|The {{letter from}} the Syndicate, {{together}} with his own convictions on the subject, were communicated by the commandant to the military authorities of the port, and to the War Office of the Dominion. The news of what had <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> had already been cabled across the Atlantic back to the United States, {{and all over the}} world; and the profound impression created by it was intensified when it became known what the Syndicate proposed to do the next day. Orders and advices from the British Admiralty and War Office sped across the ocean, and that night few of the leaders in government circles in England or Canada closed their eyes.|$|E
60|$|Nothing <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day</b> {{except that}} some priests arrived, lifted the {{earthenware}} pot, examined their departed colleague, who by now {{had become an}} unencouraging spectacle, removed old dishes of food, arranged more about him, and went off. Also the clouds grew thicker and thicker, and the air more and more chilly, till, had we been in any northern latitude, I should have said that snow was pending. From our perch on the roof-top I observed the population of Simba Town discussing the weather with ever-increasing eagerness; also {{that the people who}} were going out to work in the fields wore mats over their shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|Thus the Sheriff of Nottingham tried thrice to take Robin Hood {{and failed}} each time; {{and the last}} time he was frightened, for he felt how near he had come to losing his life; so he said, [...] "These men fear neither God nor man, nor king nor king's officers. I would sooner lose mine office than my life, so I will trouble them no more." [...] So he kept close within his castle for many a day and dared not show his face outside of his own household, and all the time he was gloomy and would speak to no one, for he was ashamed of what had <b>happened</b> <b>that</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
