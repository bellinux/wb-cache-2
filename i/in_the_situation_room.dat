Baker and Counselor to the President Edwin Meese went to Reagan's hospital still believing {{that the president was}} unharmed. Within five minutes of the shooting, members of the Cabinet began gathering in the White House Situation Room. Haig, Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and National Security Advisor Richard Allen discussed various issues, including the location of the nuclear football, the apparent presence of more than the usual number of Soviet submarines unusually close off the Atlantic coast, a possible Soviet invasion of Poland against the Solidarity movement, and the presidential line of succession. Although normally no tape recorders are allowed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Room</b> these meetings were recorded with the participants' knowledge by Allen, and the tapes have since been made public.|$|E

500|$|On May 1 at 1:22p.m., Panetta, {{acting on}} the president's orders, {{directed}} McRaven {{to move forward with}} the operation. Shortly after 3p.m., the president joined national security officials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Room</b> to monitor the raid. They watched night-vision images taken from a Sentinel drone while Panetta, appearing {{in a corner of the}} screen from CIA headquarters, narrated what was happening. Video links with Panetta at CIA headquarters and McRaven in Afghanistan were set up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Room.</b> In an adjoining office was the live drone feed presented on a laptop computer operated by Brigadier General Marshall Webb, assistant commander of JSOC. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was one of those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Room,</b> and described it like this: [...] "Contrary to some news reports and what you see in the movies, we had no means to see what was happening inside the building itself. All we could do was wait for an update from the team on the ground. I looked at the President. He was calm. Rarely have I been prouder to serve by his side as I was that day." [...] Two other command centers monitored the raid from the Pentagon and the American embassy in Islamabad.|$|E

The vice president arrived at the White House at 7:00p.m., and did not invoke Section 4 of the 25th Amendment. He stated on national television at 8:20p.m.: ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{obtained}} a duplicate nuclear football and Gold Codes card, {{and kept it}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>room.</b> (Reagan's football was still with the officer at the hospital, and Bush also had a card and football.) The participants discussed whether to raise the military's alert status, {{and the importance of}} doing so without changing the DEFCON level, although the number of Soviet submarines proved to be normal. Upon learning that Reagan was in surgery, Haig declared, the [...] "helm is right here. And that means right in this chair for now, constitutionally, until the vice president gets here." [...] However, Haig made an inaccurate statement. As the sitting Secretary of State, he was fourth behind Vice President [...] Bush, [...] Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and President pro tempore of the Senate Strom Thurmond in the line of succession and, under , O'Neill and Thurmond would have had to resign their positions to become acting president. Although others in the room knew that Haig's statement was constitutionally incorrect, they did not object at the time to avoid a confrontation.|$|E

500|$|Several {{officials}} who were present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Room,</b> including the president, {{told reporters that}} the code name for bin Laden was [...] "Geronimo".

Panetta said, [...] "We have a visual on Geronimo", and later, [...] "Geronimo EKIA"—enemy killed in action. The words of the commander on the ground were, [...] "For God and country, Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo." [...] Officials subsequently explained that {{each step of the}} mission was labelled alphabetically in an [...] "Execution Checklist", which is used to ensure all participants in a large operation are kept synchronized with a minimum of radio traffic. [...] "Geronimo" [...] indicated the raiders had reached step [...] "G", the capture or killing of bin Laden.

5000|$|In Ron Suskind’s book, The One Percent Doctrine, Suskind {{describes}} the acute {{difference between the}} public perception and the reality behind the use of <b>the</b> White House <b>Situation</b> Room:“The <b>Situation</b> <b>Room</b> - that rectangle of wood paneling and dropdown screens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> White House basement - has recently matched the Oval Office as most storied chamber of <b>the</b> US government. <b>In</b> an odd turn of the media age, this tiny square of carpeted real estate has seized the public’s imagination. … On balance though, little actually get done there….For problem solving and action plans, anxious public servants will, time and again, by pass <b>the</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Room</b> for its small adjacent conference room - a place where real work gets done." [...] Beginning in October 2001, a half dozen or so key officials met each Wednesday morning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Room’s</b> conference room. Aufhauser managed the group. Suskind writes, “David Aufhauser, an elegant Washington lawyer [...] [...] [...] coordinated the government’s overall ‘financial war.’” Officials from the National Security Council, Central Intelligence Agency, and National Security Agency (NSA) met under Aufhauser’s command. The group’s mission was {{to figure out how}} money flowed around the globe to Al-Qaeda, and how to stop that flow. The man who straps a bomb to his chest as he enters a marketplace is implacable. He is beyond redemption and cannot be deterred. It would be the height of irony and a promise of future tragedy if we permit the orthodoxy of how we have organized ourselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past and how we have collected and acted upon intelligence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past to deter us from responding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> future. — David Aufhauser (2004)Testimony before the United States Senate On June 15, 2004, Aufhauser testified before a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, “An Assessment of Current Efforts to Combat Terrorism Financing.” In his testimony, he didn’t mince words when describing Osama bin Laden, who he called a “hapless businessman” whose “ventures failed and were not the principal source of al Qaeda’s wealth.” In explaining bin Laden’s rise to leadership, Aufhauser testified, “In doing so, bin Laden managed to leverage the tactic of terror into a malevolent dogma embraced by an army of madmen.” ...|$|R

25|$|The uniform reintroduced a khaki service coat {{worn with}} a black necktie and {{shoulder}} boards.
