40|$|Graduation date: 1938 The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} possibilities of raising lavender in Oregon of desirable qualities and. yield. This {{was carried out by}} analysis and study of the properties of the oil obtained therefrom in order that a comparison with other kinds of lavender oil might be made. It was also necessary to make a study of the methods of cultivation, harvesting, and extraction of the oil. After deciding upon the species of the lavender the physical properties of the oil were determined and found to coincide most closely to those of the oil obtained from the English variety of Lavandula vera. On isolation the most abundant chemical constituents of the oil determined were <b>ethyl</b> <b>amyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> limonene, and linalool. The separation of these constituents was carried out by fractional distillation in a specially designed vacuum still. The constituents were {{similar to those of the}} English oil. This English oil is considered to have the most desirable qualities as a perfume and demands the highest price of the many different lavender oils. From this comparison and the excellent odor of the oil it was concluded that it was an oil of good quality. From the standpoint of quality end yield of the oil from the plant the possibilities of raising lavender in Oregon seem quite favorable...|$|E
40|$|Tensile {{strength}} and fracture toughness of castings of the hydantoin resins cured with methylenedianiline are {{significantly higher than}} MY 720 control castings. Water absorption of an <b>ethyl,</b> <b>amyl</b> hydantoin formulation is 2. 1 percent at equilibrium and Tg's are about 160 C, approximately 15 deg below the final cure temperature. Two series of urethane and ester-extended hydantoin epoxy resins were synthesized {{to determine the effect}} of crosslink density and functional groups on properties. Castings cured with methylenedianiline or with hexahydrophthalic anhydride were made from these compounds and evaluated. The glass transition temperatures, tensile strengths and moduli, and fracture toughness values were all much lower than that of the simple hydantoin epoxy resins. Using a methylene bishydantoin epoxy with a more rigid structure gave brittle, low-energy fractures, while a more flexible, ethoxy-extended hydantoin epoxy resin gave a very low Tg...|$|R
50|$|Lacquer Thinner {{is usually}} a mixture of {{solvents}} able to dissolve {{a number of different}} resins or plastics used in modern lacquer.Previously, lacquer thinners frequently contained alkyl esters like butyl or <b>amyl</b> acetate, <b>ketones</b> like acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, aromatic hydrocarbons like toluene, ethers such as glycol cellosolves, and/or alcohols.Beginning in the 21st century parts of the United States began a reduction of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) starting in Los Angeles, CA. The control of these lacquer thinners are completed by California Air Resources and South Coast Air Quality Management District. New ingredients to match air standards in lacquer thinner are now available such as Oxsol 100, soy methyl esters, ethylene glycol and there is ongoing development.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a review of}} the {{available}} literature on the main features of 11 of the most widely adopted oxygenated additives to base gasoline and diesel, focusing particularly on the emissions from the oxygenates considered as additives. The oxygenated additives studied are methyl tert-butyl ether, ethyl tertiary butyl ether, tert-amyl <b>ethyl</b> ether, tertiary <b>amyl</b> methyl ether, isopropyl ether, dimethyl carbonate, dimethoxymethane, dibutyl ether, diglycol methyl ether, diethyl carbonate, and 2 -methoxyethyl acetate...|$|R
40|$|Targeted extra-cellular recordings. We {{performed}} extracellular recording {{in animals}} using {{up to two}} silicon probes simultaneously. Probes were always implanted within a ~ 900 by 900 µm zone located on the posterior lateral part of the dorsal olfactory bulb (~ 700 µm from the midline and ~ 400 µm from the caudal sinus; see Figure 1 B). Given its size, the target area might approximately contain between 100 and 200 glomeruli (average glomerular diameter 90 µm, {{but it must be}} taken into account that a glomerulus can sit on top of another). Preliminary intrinsic optical imaging (Figure 1 A) showed that three odorant molecules (hexanone, <b>ethyl</b> butyrate, <b>amyl</b> acetate) were eliciting glomeruli responses with different patterns in the target zone (Figure 1 B). Some of the activated glomeruli were common to two or three odor...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{capillary electrophoresis}} method {{was developed for}} the identification and quantification of the xanthate family of organosulfur compounds, {{all of which are}} used in froth floatation during the milling process of mined ore. Using this previously optimized novel method, bulk samples of unknown composition were characterized by their concentration of each xanthate, as well as the concentration of unknown compounds arising from contaminants on the manufacturing side or degradation products. Calibration curves were prepared for the four different organic-chain xanthates: <b>amyl,</b> <b>ethyl,</b> isopropyl, and isobutyl. Not peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|It is {{critical}} for normal brains to perceive the external world precisely and accurately under ever-changing operational conditions, yet the mechanisms underlying this fundamental brain function in the sensory systems are poorly understood. To address this issue in the olfactory system, we investigated the responses of olfactory bulbs to odor stimulations under different brain states manipulated by anesthesia levels. Our results revealed that in two brain states, where the spontaneous baseline activities differed about twofold based on the local field potential (LFP) signals, the levels of neural activities reached after the same odor stimulation had no significant difference. This phenomenon was independent of anesthetics (pentobarbital or chloral hydrate), stimulating odorants (ethyl propionate, ethyl butyrate, <b>ethyl</b> valerate, <b>amyl</b> acetate, n-heptanal, or 2 -heptanone), odor concentrations, and recording sites (the mitral or granular cell layers) for LFPs in three frequency bands (12 – 32 Hz, 33 – 64 Hz, and 65 – 90 Hz) and for multiunit activities. Furthermore, the activity patterns of the same stimulation under these two brain states were highly similar at both LFP and multiunit levels. These converging results argue the existence of mechanisms in the olfactory bulbs that ensure the delivery of peripheral olfactory information to higher olfactory centers with high fidelity under different brain states...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} novel process {{integration}} for biodiesel blend in the Membrane assisted Reactive Divided Wall Distillation (MRDW) column. Biodiesel is a green fuel and grade of biodiesel blend is B 20 (%) which consist of 20 % biodiesel and rest 80 % commercial diesel. Instead of commercial diesel, Tertiary <b>Amyl</b> <b>Ethyl</b> Ether (TAEE) {{was used as}} an environment friendly fuel for blending biodiesel. Biodiesel and TAEE were synthesized in a pilot scale reactive distillation column. Dual reactive distillation and MRDW were simulated using aspen plus. B 20 (%) limit calculation was performed using feed flow rates of both TAEE and biodiesel. MRDW was compared with dual reactive distillation column and it was observed that MRDW is comparatively cost effective and suitable in terms of improved heat integration and flow pattern...|$|R
3000|$|Alcohols and ethers {{are used}} as oxygenated {{additives}} to motor fuels and as antiknock components in gasoline. They increase the octane number and reduce the emissions of gases to greenhouse effect (CO x [...] and NO x [...]). These oxygenated compounds have partially replaced the lead-based salts that are toxic and pollutant. Among the tertiary ethers, such as ethyl tertiary butyl ether, tertiary <b>amyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> ether and tertiary amyl methyl ether, MTBE is the oxygenated additive currently, {{the most widely used}} in the reformulated gasoline and also one of organic chemicals the most produced industrially [1]. However, the major drawback of this ether is its easy diffusion in the ground water, its slow biological breakdown and its unpleasant odour. The diisopropyl ether (DIPE) can be a potential candidate to substitute the MTBE. It has the advantage to increase the octane number and to have a lower vapour pressure. Various works proposed the synthesis of the DIPE from propene and water in a two-stage process [2], from a feed of acetone and hydrogen in a two-stage process [3] or one-step process [4] and from acetone feedstock [5]. The DIPE can be also synthesised either from a feed of propylene and water [6] or from a feed of propene and isopropanol over an acidic ion exchange resin like Amberlyst 15 [7]. The synthesis of the DIPE from the isopropanol decomposition was examined over aluminosilicates supported sulfopolyphenylketone (or polyphenylketone) [8] and over sulphated titania [9].|$|R
