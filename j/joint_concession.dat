500|$|After the self-immolation, the U.S. {{put more}} {{pressure}} on Diệm to re-open negotiations on the faltering agreement. Diệm had scheduled an emergency cabinet meeting at 11:30 on 11 June to discuss the Buddhist crisis which he believed to be winding down. Following Đức's death, Diệm canceled the meeting and met individually with his ministers. Acting U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam William Trueheart warned Nguyễn Đình Thuận, Diệm's Secretary of State, of the desperate need for an agreement, saying that the situation was [...] "dangerously near breaking point" [...] and expected Diệm would meet the Buddhists' five-point manifesto. United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk warned the Saigon embassy that the White House would publicly announce that {{it would no longer}} [...] "associate itself" [...] with the regime if this did not occur. The <b>Joint</b> Communiqué and <b>concessions</b> to the Buddhists were signed on 16 June.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, COPE {{entered the}} {{election}} an equal {{partner with the}} newly formed Civic New Democrats, a party directly affiliated with the BC NDP. Led by anti-poverty activist Jean Swanson, the coalition made few gains but {{under the leadership of}} Jim Green in 1990, the party came close to winning the election. But while all COPE council candidates were elected, no Civic NDP candidates were (since a 1983 by-election, COPE had consistently out-performed all other leftist candidates on the concurrently elected School and Parks Boards). At this point, Vancouver's civic left conceded that the COPE brand was now more popular than any more centrist group. Thus, following the 1990 election, COPE merged with the Civic NDP, changing its name from the Committee of Progressive Electors to the Coalition of Progressive Electors. At this time, COPE made an official overture to the Green Party of Vancouver, the local affiliate of the Green Party of British Columbia, offering the group some minor policy <b>concessions,</b> <b>joint</b> billing in the party's ballot name ("COPE-Green '93") and assurances that important party members would ensure some Greens were nominated. The Greens turned the deal down.|$|R
