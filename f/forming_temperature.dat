40|$|International audienceTi- 6 Al- 4 V alloy {{is widely}} used in superplastic forming process. The {{conventional}} conditions require high <b>forming</b> <b>temperatures</b> (T ≥ 900 • C) and low strain rates (˙ ε ≤ 10 − 3 s − 1). In {{order to reduce the}} costs of the industrial process, recent investigations focus on the micro-structural refinement of the material. It allows an improvement of the forming conditions which makes lower <b>forming</b> <b>temperatures</b> and higher strain rates eligible whereas low strain rates (˙ ε ≤ 10 − 3 s − 1) and high temperatures (T ≥ 800 • C) are particularly suitable for conventional superplastic forming conditions. However, the mechanical response of the Titanium alloy strongly depends on the starting micro-structure considered and on its evolution with the temperature and the deformation. The objective of the present investigation is to observe the micro-structural evolutions of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy under thermal and mechanical loadings from different starting micro-structures. Hence, an internal grain growth variable is identified by the use of these observations. Then, it is introduced into the behavior model and its influence on the mechanical response of the material is analysed. The final constitutive equations are able to take into account viscosity, strain hardening and grain size evolution {{for a wide range of}} strain rates and <b>forming</b> <b>temperatures</b> (10 − 4 s − 1 ≤ ˙ ε ≤ 10 − 2 s − 1; 650 • C ≤ T ≤ 870 • C). Moreover, the model is able to consider several starting microstructures (different initial grain sizes) and to predict their influence on the viscous flow and the strain hardening. At last, some model verifications are conducted to check the validity of the non-isothermal model formulation. Some predictions are also performed by considering several starting microstructures...|$|R

50|$|In {{the most}} common method of high-volume, {{continuous}} thermoforming of thin-gauge products, plastic sheet is fed from a roll or from an extruder into a set of indexing chains that incorporate pins, or spikes, that pierce the sheet and transport it through an oven for heating to <b>forming</b> <b>temperature.</b> The heated sheet then indexes into a form station where a mating mold and pressure-box close on the sheet, with vacuum then applied to remove trapped air and to pull the material into or onto the mold along with pressurized air to form the plastic to the detailed shape of the mold. (Plug-assists are typically used in addition to vacuum {{in the case of}} taller, deeper-draw formed parts in order to provide the needed material distribution and thicknesses in the finished parts.) After a short form cycle, a burst of reverse air pressure is actuated from the vacuum side of the mold as the form tooling opens, commonly referred to as air-eject, to break the vacuum and assist the formed parts off of, or out of, the mold. A stripper plate may also be utilized on the mold as it opens for ejection of more detailed parts or those with negative-draft, undercut areas. The sheet containing the formed parts then indexes into a trim station on the same machine, where a die cuts the parts from the remaining sheet web, or indexes into a separate trim press where the formed parts are trimmed. The sheet web remaining after the formed parts are trimmed is typically wound onto a take-up reel or fed into an inline granulator for recycling.|$|E

The formability of AZ 31 sheets at high temperature was evaluated by forming limit diagrams (FLD). The fracture morphologies were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. The {{results show that the}} FLD of AZ 31 Mg alloy is affected by the <b>forming</b> <b>temperature,</b> in another word, the formability increases with the increasing of the <b>forming</b> <b>temperature.</b> That may be because the non-basal slip system starts to move by thermal activation at high <b>forming</b> <b>temperature.</b> It is also demonstrated that the formability of the AZ 31 Mg alloy is on the decline with the increasing of the forming speed. The slipping performs thoroughly to release the stress during the deformation if the forming speed decreases.

In order to characterize this process to enable cycle to cycle control, a small-scale system was developed, using a hot embossing machine, taping machine, and functional tester previously created. Parts were moved between these machines with an Epson GlO SCARA robot, which provided the appropriate efficiency and accuracy. This system {{was able to}} produce embossed parts with a takt time of less than 135 seconds, and over 1000 of such parts were produced. The system was analyzed to determine potential sources of variance, considering both things that would alter the part and things that would alter the measurements. This enabled the system to be run {{in a state of}} statistical control, which in turn allowed for a designed experiment to be done on the system. This designed experiment determined that the <b>forming</b> <b>temperature,</b> forming force, forming time, as well as the square terms for the <b>forming</b> <b>temperature</b> and forming force and the cross-terms of forming force with <b>forming</b> <b>temperature</b> and forming time with <b>forming</b> <b>temperature,</b> were all statistically significant in the formation of parts.
