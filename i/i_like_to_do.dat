That's why <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> them myself a lot of the time, or initially I'll lay down the tracks. I'll double my voice or do a couple of tracks of my own voice. It's easy for me to match my voice. And then if I'm going to use other background singers, I'll let them go on top of mine.|$|E

I think {{there are too many}} songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, and I find it really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit of}} melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E

We shot it chronologically, which helped. The water was freezing cold. We shot the drowning many, many times. I remember looking down the shore, after I {{had been there for}} five or six hours, and I saw two smiling faces, in the form of Gemma Whelan and Alfie Allen. They were just smiling their asses off, because they weren't cold! They just had to run to the boat." [...] In regards to stunts, Asbæk continued, [...] "I {{got a little bit of}} help, but not much. I think 95 percent of it was me. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> all of it when I can, because then I can feel it with the character." ...|$|E

However, {{it would have to be}} pushed back to 2013. Pusha T described the tape as street-oriented music intended for his longtime fans.

I can do what I really, really want to do… not about more of a creative , I just think it's about more of what I want to hear for myself and what my fans want to hear. They want to hear lyrics, they want to hear street …it's just the whole street life perspective." ...|$|E
500|$|Between landing {{the role}} in The Hunger Games and the film's release, {{he played a}} lead role and served as an {{executive}} producer for two films: Detention (2011) and The Forger (2012). In Detention, he {{played the role of}} popular teenager Clapton Davis in a film the plot of which has been compared to 1985's The Breakfast Club. His role in The Forger was as a 15-year-old orphan who finds himself in trouble until Alfred Molina's character comes to his aid. The film was not well received but the actors' chemistry together and their performance was. He next reprised his role as Sean Anderson in the 2012 Journey to the Center of the Earth sequel, [...] Hutcherson has always been vocal about his desire to work on films of all sorts of genres. Regarding the switch from comedy-drama The Kids Are All Right to the Journey sequel, he stated: [...] "For me, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> all different types of films and to go from having that awesome [...] kind of thing that I love doing so much with great characters and a really great script to a bigger kind of studio film, to just cover the whole kind of spectrum of movies is really, really cool." [...] Although the film was largely panned, it fared well commercially and his performance was well received, with Kofi Outlaw of Screenrant.com appreciating how he [...] "does a good job holding the screen and portraying a somewhat layered protagonist". Later in 2012, he appeared in Red Dawn, a remake of the 1984 film of the same name. The film was panned by critics, achieving only a 12 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest score of any film Hutcherson has acted in.|$|E

2500|$|Wieringo {{explained}} the philosophy behind his drawing style thus: [...] "I {{just try to}} keep things fun. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> fun comics. It doesn't have to be realistic to be believable. In fact, I sometimes think that funny [...] might actually add something to certain books." [...] When he began illustrating the Rogue miniseries, he was intimidated by the dark tone of that book's story, but once he finished the first issue, the editors decided to light up the [...] "grim and gritty" [...] tone of the story.|$|E

Surely, this sacrifice of time and inclination requires some compensation, which it meets with. But how am I entitled to make my fortune (which cannot be done without all this anxiety and drudgery) who do hardly any thing at all, and never any thing but what <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> I rise when I please, breakfast at length, write what comes into my head, and after taking a mutton-chop and a dish of strong tea, go to the play, and thus my time passes.|$|E

[...] "I was involved from A-Z," [...] she said. [...] "Every song on the album was inspired by my life [...] I wanted to talk about how I feel on so many levels.
