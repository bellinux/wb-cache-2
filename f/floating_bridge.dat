5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the state {{government}} conducted a feasibility study for a second <b>floating</b> <b>bridge</b> across Lake Washington, in response to increased traffic on the bridge. In 1953, the Washington State Legislature approved {{the construction of a}} second <b>floating</b> <b>bridge,</b> using past and future tolls to fund its construction. The west end of the <b>floating</b> <b>bridge</b> would be connected to the Everett–Seattle tollway (later Interstate 5) at Roanoke Street, south of the planned Ship Canal Bridge, as well as the proposed Empire Way Expressway at Montlake. The east end would be connected to a north–south freeway bypass of the Seattle area, which later became Interstate 405. Two alignments for the <b>floating</b> <b>bridge</b> were considered in the late 1950s: a Sand Point–Kirkland, favored by the City of Seattle; and an Evergreen Point crossing, favored by {{the state government}} and the U.S. Navy, which operated Naval Air Station Sand Point. The state government initially chose the Montlake–Evergreen Point alignment in 1954, intending to begin construction in 1955, but the alignment dispute delayed a final decision until December 1956. Citizen groups from the Montlake area protested the decision, but were largely ignored by the project's citizen committee.|$|E
5|$|The {{floating}} bridges carry Interstate 90 and State Route 520 across Lake Washington to the Eastside suburbs. The SR 520 Albert D. Rosellini Evergreen Point <b>Floating</b> <b>Bridge,</b> {{which opened}} in 2016 as the replacement for another <b>floating</b> <b>bridge</b> at the same site, is the longest <b>floating</b> <b>bridge</b> in the world. The Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge had previously been replaced after the original span sunk in 1990 when water filled an open maintenance hatch during refurbishing. Age and the 2001 Nisqually earthquake have damaged several other spans. The risk of future earthquakes has increased the need to replace already deteriorated bridges in the city, such as the Alaskan Way Viaduct and the Magnolia Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{will begin}} Link light rail service along the Redmond {{portion of the}} SR520 {{corridor}} in 2023, {{with the opening of}} the East Link Extension. Approved by voters in 2008, the line will connect Overlake Transit Center at Northeast 40th Street and Overlake Village station at 152nd Avenue Northeast to Seattle and Downtown Bellevue, crossing Lake Washington on the I-90 <b>floating</b> <b>bridge.</b> In 2024, the line will be extended along SR520 to Downtown Redmond, as part of Sound Transit 3. The rebuilt <b>floating</b> <b>bridge</b> was also designed to accommodate a future light rail extension, requiring supplemental pontoons and new approaches.|$|E

5|$|The SR520 {{corridor}} {{is served}} by Sound Transit Express route 545, {{as well as other}} Sound Transit Express, King County Metro, and Community Transit bus routes. The corridor averaged about 8,000 weekday riders in 2009, using 600 bus trips. During peak periods, buses travel on SR520 every one to four minutes between the Evergreen Point <b>Floating</b> <b>Bridge</b> and I-405.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Evergreen Point <b>Floating</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{began on}} August 29, 1960, with pontoon {{assembly}} beginning the following year. The bridge and its approach highways, connecting the main branch of Primary State Highway 1 in Seattle to its Eastside branch near Bellevue, {{were added to}} the state highway system in March 1961. The western approach, an expressway between the Roanoke Interchange, Portage Bay, Montlake, and the Washington Park Arboretum, began construction in early 1962. The eastern approach was constructed between 1962 and 1963, connecting Medina, Secondary State Highway 2A in southern Houghton, and Northup Way, which continued east towards Redmond.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1990s, SR520 {{has been}} {{expanded}} with high-occupancy vehicle lanes (HOV lanes) and new interchanges {{to serve the}} Overlake area. The original Evergreen Point <b>Floating</b> <b>Bridge</b> was replaced in 2016 by a wider bridge, {{as part of a}} multibillion-dollar expansion program that is scheduled to be completed in the 2020s. The program also includes the construction of new bus infrastructure at Montlake and on the Eastside, as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path along most of the highway's length.|$|E
50|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>bridges</b> can be {{vulnerable}} to inclement weather, especially strong winds. The U.S. state of Washington is {{home to some of}} the longest permanent <b>floating</b> <b>bridges</b> in the world, and two of these failed in part due to strong winds.|$|R
50|$|The Interstate 90 <b>floating</b> <b>bridges</b> are two <b>floating</b> <b>bridges</b> in {{the state}} of Washington that carry Interstate 90 across Lake Washington between Seattle and Mercer Island. The bridge names are the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge and the Homer M. Hadley Memorial Bridge.|$|R
50|$|On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused major {{damage to}} the Greenville facility, {{undermining}} the <b>float</b> <b>bridge</b> gantries and sinking one of the car floats. The 81-year-old gantry structures were in such bad condition {{that they had to}} be demolished. The working <b>float</b> <b>bridge</b> at Bush Terminal was transferred by barge to Greenville to restore rail float service. Previously plans called for the gantries to be demolished in phases and replaced by two new <b>float</b> <b>bridges</b> and a barge transfer station.|$|R
5|$|The Evergreen Point <b>Floating</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{opened on}} August 28, 1963, {{along with the}} Roanoke Expressway, part of the Seattle Freeway, and the eastern {{approach}} to Houghton and Bellevue at a temporary interchange with 104th Avenue Northeast. The bridge and its approaches, constituting a state highway, were re-designated as State Route 520 under the new state highway numbering system adopted in 1964. SR520 would use a temporary route on local roads between Bellevue and SR202 in Redmond until the planned freeway was completed by the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Evergreen Point <b>Floating</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{was opened}} in 1963 {{as a replacement}} for the cross-lake ferry system that had operated {{since the turn of the}} century. SR520 was designated in 1964 as a freeway connecting I-5 to I-405, while an extension to Redmond was proposed later in the decade. In the 1970s and 1980s, sections of the freeway between Bellevue and Redmond were opened to traffic, replacing the temporary designation of State Route 920 (SR920).|$|E
5|$|Settlements {{along the}} eastern shore of Lake Washington were {{established}} in the late 19th century by homesteaders, real estate developers, and industrialists. A ferry system was set up between towns on the lake and Seattle to the west in the 1880s. By 1913, the steam ferry Leschi was transporting automobiles, in addition to pedestrian traffic, between Seattle and docks in Bellevue, Kirkland, and Medina. In 1940, the Lake Washington <b>Floating</b> <b>Bridge</b> was opened between Seattle and Mercer Island, carrying the Sunset Highway (later I-90) from Seattle towards Bellevue and the Eastside. The new bridge allowed for the Eastside to rapidly develop into bedroom communities in the 1940s and 1950s; the bridge also replaced the ferry system, which ceased operation in 1950, shortly after the removal of tolls on the bridge.|$|E

One company {{is known to}} be a training company while the other is an operational company, with operational status rotating with each mono intake. Each company is split into three platoons, namely two bridging platoons (Alpha and Bravo) and one watercraft platoon. Each bridging platoon operates 4 M3G <b>Float</b> <b>Bridges</b> which require an operating crew of 4. Each raft consists of two rigs, which form a Class 60 raft or a <b>float</b> <b>bridge</b> when coupled together further. The M3G <b>Float</b> <b>Bridges</b> also require substantial bank preparation prior to breaching in.|$|R
5000|$|In 1935, the BEDT {{entered into}} {{agreement}} with the City of New York to construct a <b>float</b> <b>bridge</b> and team tracks at the Wallabout Market in Brooklyn (north of the Brooklyn Navy Yard) {{and south of the}} Delaware, Lackawanna & Western's [...] "Wallabout Terminal". Pursuant to this agreement, the BEDT had to agree to trackage connecting this terminal to the Navy Yard tracks, despite the fact that a separate <b>float</b> <b>bridge</b> was already in place for the Navy Yard. This <b>float</b> <b>bridge</b> and team tracks would allow vendors to receive carload lots of produce for resale in the Wallabout Market.|$|R
5|$|The Washington State Transportation Commission began seeking {{alternatives}} for the bridge replacement project in 1997, including a Sand Point crossing and various designs for a parallel replacement span. The alternatives were narrowed to a replacement span, with varying lane widths and configurations for interchanges in Seattle, in 2003. The project's preferred alternative, a replacement span with six lanes and a mixed-use trail, {{was chosen by}} WSDOT in 2011. The $4.56 billion megaproject, which encompasses the SR520 corridor between I-5 and I-405, was funded using a state gas tax and electronic tolls on the <b>floating</b> <b>bridge</b> introduced on December 29, 2011, to repay construction bonds over a 40-year period.|$|E
5|$|The former SeaWorld site {{began to}} be {{demolished}} in late 2004, when Geauga Lake started construction on a new water park. On November 11, 2004 Geauga Lake announced Wildwater Kingdom, a new water park {{scheduled to open in}} 2005. It would be constructed in two phases, with the first phase costing $16million and the second phase $8million. The first phase consisted of a ProSlide Tornado, an activity pool, an action river and a new children's area with a multistory play structure. Hurricane Mountain, Ohio's tallest water-slide complex, was moved from the existing water park to the new Wildwater Kingdom and renamed Thunder Falls. Together, they formed Geauga Lake & Wildwater Kingdom. The parks were connected by a <b>floating</b> <b>bridge</b> {{in the middle of the}} lake.|$|E
5|$|From Seattle, SR520 crosses Lake Washington on the tolled Evergreen Point Floating Bridge; at , it is {{the longest}} <b>floating</b> <b>bridge</b> in the world. Tolls are {{collected}} electronically using the state's Good to Go pass or by mail, and vary based on time of day and number of axles; the minimum Good to Go toll, , is $1.25 between midnight and 5a.m., and the maximum is $4.30 during the morning and evening peak periods. The freeway reaches {{the eastern end of}} Lake Washington at Evergreen Point in northern Medina, where it travels under a lidded park and next to a median-side bus station. After an interchange and lid at 84th Avenue Northeast in Hunts Point, SR520 travels eastward around the northern edge of Clyde Hill in a north-facing arc, passing through the Yarrow Point lid and bus station. The freeway enters Bellevue, intersecting I-405 and crossing over the Eastside Rail Corridor. SR520 continues along {{the north side of the}} Bel-Red industrial area and enters the Overlake area of Redmond.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the Evergreen Point <b>Floating</b> <b>Bridge</b> in 1963, several {{proposals}} from local governments have requested the construction of a parallel span or additional pontoons to increase capacity and add infrastructure for rapid transit and bicyclists. Daily traffic crossing the bridge rose from 17,400 cars in 1964 to nearly 100,000 in 1987, making the bridge the worst traffic bottleneck in the state of Washington. By the late 1990s, the bridge was carrying twice as much traffic as it was designed to handle, and calls from Eastside cities and companies for a replacement bridge intensified. WSDOT engineers also determined that sections of the bridge would fail during a large earthquake or a major windstorm, and that the bridge was nearing the end of its life expectancy, necessitating a total replacement. The bridge underwent a major rehabilitation in 1999, including a seismic retrofit and increased resistance to stronger sustained winds, to extend the life expectancy to 20 to 25 years.|$|E
