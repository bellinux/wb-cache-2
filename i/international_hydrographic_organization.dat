40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedConventional near-shore large-scale hydrographic surveys use only {{two lines of}} position (LOPs) for position fixing. Previous works have proved that accuracies needed to meet the present <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Organizations</b> standards are frequently not achieved using conventional surveying methods. The concept of using multiple lines of position (MLOP) adjusted by the least squares method was described. Actual field measurements acquired {{in the autumn of}} 1984 were processed to ascertain the increase in accuracy using MLOP versus conventional two LOPs on each hydrographic position. Recommendations are to use a four-range fully automated position-fixing method to increase production, improve data quality, and have better control of the survey operations.

25|$|The Arctic Ocean is the {{smallest}} and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Organization</b> (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean {{can be seen as}} the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.|$|E
25|$|Western Australia is bounded to {{the east}} by {{longitude}} 129°E, the meridian 129 degrees east of Greenwich, which defines the border with South Australia and the Northern Territory, and bounded by the Indian Ocean {{to the west and}} north. The <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Organization</b> (IHO) designates the body of water south of the continent as part of the Indian Ocean; in Australia it is officially gazetted as the Southern Ocean.|$|E
25|$|By {{way of his}} voyages in the 1770s, Captain James Cook {{proved that}} waters {{encompassed}} the southern latitudes of the globe. Since then, geographers have disagreed on the Southern Ocean's northern boundary or even existence, considering the waters as {{various parts of the}} Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, instead. However, according to Commodore John Leech of the <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Organization</b> (IHO), recent oceanographic research has discovered the importance of Southern Circulation, and the term Southern Ocean has been used to define the body of water which lies south of the northern limit of that circulation. This remains the current official policy of the IHO, since a 2000 revision of its definitions including the Southern Ocean as the waters south of the 60th parallel has not yet been adopted. Others regard the seasonally-fluctuating Antarctic Convergence as the natural boundary.|$|E

500|$|A dispute exists {{over the}} {{international}} {{name for the}} body of water which is bordered by Japan, Korea (North and South) and Russia. In 1992, objections to the name Sea of Japan were first raised by North Korea and South Korea at the Sixth United Nations Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names. [...] The Japanese government supports the exclusive use of the name [...] "Sea of Japan" [...] (日本海), while South Korea supports the alternative name [...] "East Sea" [...] (...) , and North Korea supports the name [...] "Korean East Sea" [...] (...) [...] [...] Currently, most international maps and documents use either the name Sea of Japan (or equivalent translation) exclusively, and far fewer maps include both the name Sea of Japan and East Sea, often with East Sea listed in parentheses or otherwise marked as a secondary name. [...] The <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Organization,</b> the international governing body for the naming of bodies of water around the world, in 2012 decided not to change the current single name [...] "Sea of Japan" [...] rejecting South Korea's request to use [...] "East Sea" [...] together with [...] "Sea of Japan".|$|E
500|$|The Adriatic Sea is a semi-enclosed sea, bordered in the {{southwest}} by the Apennine or Italian Peninsula, in the northwest by the Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, and in the northeast by Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania—the Balkan peninsula. In the southeast, the Adriatic Sea connects to the Ionian Sea at the [...] wide Strait of Otranto. The <b>International</b> <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Organization</b> (IHO) defines {{the boundary between the}} Adriatic and the Ionian seas as a line running from the Butrinto River's mouth (latitude 39°44'N) in Albania to the Karagol Cape in Corfu, through this island to the Kephali Cape (these two capes are in latitude 39°45'N), and on to the Santa Maria di Leuca Cape (latitude 39°48'N). It extends [...] from the northwest to the southeast and is [...] wide. It covers [...] and has a volume of [...] The Adriatic extends northwest from 40° to 45°47' north, representing the Mediterranean's northernmost portion. The sea is geographically divided into the Northern Adriatic, Central (or Middle) Adriatic, and Southern Adriatic. The Adriatic Sea drainage basin encompasses , yielding a land–sea ratio of 1.8. The drainage basin's mean elevation is [...] above sea level, with a mean slope of 12.1°. Major rivers discharging into the Adriatic include the Po, Soča, Krka, Neretva, Drin, Bojana, and Vjosë. In the late 19th century, Austria-Hungary established a geodetic network with an elevation benchmark using the average Adriatic Sea level at the Sartorio pier in Trieste, Italy. The benchmark was subsequently retained by Austria, adopted by Yugoslavia, and retained by the states that emerged after its dissolution. In 2016, Slovenia adopted a new elevation benchmark referring to the upgraded tide gauge station in the coastal town of Koper.|$|E
