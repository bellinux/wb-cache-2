30|$|Second, {{in order}} to test the {{predictions}} regarding (unexpected) drops in new match quality, Part II studies the probability of a reduction <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction from one year to the other. Although both the stepping stone and the learning model predict an average gain <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction following a <b>job</b> quit, <b>in</b> the stepping stone model this is the result from only positive changes <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction, while <b>in</b> the learning model this is a positive sum of all positive and negative changes <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction. Hence, to distinguish between both models it is necessary that some workers quitting their job experience a decline <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction. The results from a fixed effects logit model are presented in the lower part of Table  3. The results indicate that job quitters are less likely to experience a reduction <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction than job stayers. Furthermore, a reduction <b>in</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction is more likely if workers leave a good job. This confirms earlier evidence from the raw data that job satisfaction reductions occur after a job quit, which means that there is a role for the learning model. The relative importance of both models is investigated in the next section.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationships}} between the factors <b>in</b> <b>job</b> characteristics with the employees' motivation and to examine the factors <b>in</b> <b>job</b> characteristics that influencing employees' motivation. Methodology - The study used stratified random sampling to select the sample size of respondents from employees in Units of Administration Services at Chief Minister Department of Malacca. Data were collected on a structured questionnaire containing some demographic background of respondents, factors <b>in</b> <b>job</b> characteristics and employees' motivation. Then the data analyzed using descriptive statistical analysis, coefficient of reliability analysis and Pearson Correlation Coefficient analysis. Findings - Consistent with previous studies related to relationship between factors <b>in</b> <b>job</b> characteristics and employees' motivation, the study showed that all the factors <b>in</b> <b>job</b> characteristics (skill variety, task identity, task significance, job autonomy and feedback) have a positive significant relationship with employees' motivation. Conclusion - The research has proven that the factors <b>in</b> <b>job</b> characteristics have positive relationship with employees' motivation. However, factor <b>in</b> <b>job</b> characteristics that has the highest relationship with employees' motivation is skill variety. As a conclusion, there is positive relationship between factors <b>in</b> <b>job</b> characteristics with employees' motivation.

Born became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1937, and of the Royal Society of London in March 1939. During 1939, he got as many of his remaining friends and relatives still in Germany as he could out of the country, including his sister Käthe, in-laws Kurt and Marga, and the daughters of his friend Heinrich Rausch von Traubenberg.

During the 1970s, the docks fell into decline as they proved {{too small for}} new, larger ships, {{and when they were}} abandoned in 1982 over 3,000 people lost their jobs. Salford City Council purchased the docks in 1984 and since then they underwent regeneration as a centre of tourism in Salford, which included the construction of the Lowry Centre. More than 10,000 people are employed in the Quays <b>in</b> <b>jobs</b> such as retail, construction, and e-commerce. In 2007, it was confirmed that the BBC would be moving five of its departments to a new development on Pier 9 of Salford Quays, to be called MediaCityUK.

However a 2011 study by 4-Consulting calculated that there was probably a small net loss <b>in</b> <b>jobs</b> in Scotland from government support for {{renewable energy}}. They estimated that the offshore wind industry might create between 300–2,200 long-term jobs by 2020. With 20 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, the sector {{has the potential to}} grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region. Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of offshore wind power development, and the emerging wave power and tidal power industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands. Rural job creation is being supported by bioenergy systems in areas such as Lochaber, Moray and Dumfries and Galloway.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, it was the largest mall complex {{developed}} by CBL. In the first year, it was projected that the mall would employee 2,500 employees—instantly making it the largest employer in the city; this was expected to expand to 3,500 with the completion of the second phase. It was hoped it would generate $80 million in sales. In addition to helping to retain local shoppers who might otherwise travel the 2½ hours southeast to Houston for mall shopping, CBL and city officials expected the mall would draw shoppers from around the Brazos Valley. Before its opening, the city did not have a highly developed retail community. With the planned additions, then College Station city manager North Bardell said it was expected to generate $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, nearly equal to what the city collected in the previous fiscal year from all other sales. It would bring in another $120,000 in property taxes, a half-million in taxes for College Station Independent School District, and $1 million in electric bills. The increase <b>in</b> <b>jobs</b> was seen as good for the community, and the city hoped it would attract new civic groups to the area.

5|$|In February 2009, the Home Office {{published}} a report evaluating {{the effectiveness of}} the Gateway Protection Programme. The research it was based upon focused on refugees' integration into British society in the 18 months following their resettlement. The research found that refugees showed signs of integration, including the formation of social bonds through community groups and places of worship. The report noted that low employment rates and slow progress with acquiring English language skills were particular concerns. Younger refugees and children had made the most progress. No specific language lessons are provided under the Gateway Protection Programme. Instead, Gateway refugees who require help with their English language skills are provided with access to mainstream English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) courses, which are run by a range of state, voluntary and community-based organisations. However, the International Catholic Migration Commission (ICMC) Europe reports that in Sheffield, it can be difficult for resettled refugees to gain access to ESOL classes because demand has generally exceeded supply – a situation also noted by an evaluation of the scheme's operation in Motherwell undertaken in 2013. The Motherwell evaluation found that most of the male refugees were in employment, but that many of them were not <b>in</b> <b>jobs</b> that allowed them to use their skills. The majority of women were not in work, reflecting a lack of job opportunities but also a lack of childcare provision.|$|E
