2500|$|The {{stiletto}} {{remained a}} popular weapon of criminals or political assassins from the 16th {{through the end}} of the 19th century, particularly in <b>France,</b> <b>Corsica,</b> and Italy. [...] While still used as a weapon of surprise and assassination, the use of stiletto in preference to the dagger in close combat confrontations between adversaries became widespread throughout Italy, Sardinia, and Corsica. [...] The continued popularity of the stiletto in the Kingdom of Sicily resulted in the development of the scherma di stiletto siciliano (Sicilian school of stiletto fighting). [...] A person skilled in the use of a stiletto would thrust the knife deep into the victim, then twist the blade sharply in various directions before retracting it, causing the sharp point to inflict severe internal damage not readily apparent when examining the entrance wound.|$|E
