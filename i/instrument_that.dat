5|$|The GWR's Telegraph Superintendent (1855–1892) {{patented}} the Disc Block Telegraph <b>Instrument</b> <b>that</b> {{was used}} to safely control the dispatch of trains. First used on the Metropolitan Railway in 1863 and the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway in 1864, it was later used on many other lines operated by the company.|$|E
50|$|Polyphony is a {{property}} of musical <b>instruments</b> <b>that</b> {{means that they}} can play multiple notes simultaneously. Instruments featuring polyphony {{are said to be}} polyphonic. <b>Instruments</b> <b>that</b> are not capable of polyphony are monophonic or paraphonic.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of polyphony produced the notable changes in musical <b>instruments</b> <b>that</b> mark the Renaissance from the Middle Ages musically. Its use encouraged {{the use of}} larger ensembles and demanded sets of <b>instruments</b> <b>that</b> would blend together across the whole vocal range [...]|$|R
5000|$|Many {{instruments}} originated {{during the}} Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, <b>instruments</b> <b>that</b> had existed previously {{in the medieval}} era.

5|$|The cornett {{used in the}} cantata was an <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> {{belonged to}} an earlier age: by {{the second quarter of}} the 18th century it had almost entirely {{disappeared}} from Bach's compositions.|$|E
5|$|The {{electronic}} organ developed throughout the 20th century. Some pipe organs {{were replaced by}} digital organs because of their lower purchase price, smaller physical size, and minimal maintenance requirements. In the early 1970s, Rodgers Instruments pioneered the hybrid organ, an electronic <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> incorporates real pipes; other builders such as Allen Organs and Johannus Orgelbouw have since built hybrid organs.|$|E
5|$|The transit circle {{was capable}} of {{determining}} both right ascension and declination of a star, unlike the more simple and common transit <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> can only determine the right ascension. Such an instrument {{could also be used}} to set the Observatory’s clocks by observing standard stars whose position was precisely known.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{presented}} the <b>instruments</b> <b>that</b> were originated in this region, {{as well as}} those <b>instruments</b> <b>that</b> are brought from other regions, and became deeply carved into the tradition and culture of the local people, that they feel as their own. Some of these instruments are kept only here in this region, and they are not used anymore in the area they originated from.

5000|$|The {{music of}} punta {{involves}} responsorial singing accompanied by indigenous membranophones, idiophones, and aerophones. Membranophones are <b>instruments</b> <b>that</b> create sound through a vibrating skin or vellum stretched over an opening, {{as in all}} drums. [...] Idiophones are <b>instruments</b> <b>that</b> produce sound through the vibrating of a solid material that is free of tension, commonly found in shakers, scrapers, and xylophones. Aerophones are <b>instruments</b> <b>that</b> create sound through vibrating air within a column or tube, like pipes and horns. Other instruments used in the Garifuna culture include calabash rattles called shakkas (chaka) and conch-shell trumpets.|$|R
5|$|The {{wording of}} the {{declaration}} was thus incorporated into the British Mandate for Palestine, a legal <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> created Mandatory Palestine with an explicit purpose of putting the declaration into effect and was finally formalized in September,1923. Unlike the declaration itself, the Mandate was legally binding on the British government.|$|E
5|$|Though regular 6-string {{acoustic}} {{guitars and}} electric bass guitar {{was used in}} the original studio recording of the song, in the music video, in keeping with the turn-of-the-century theme, some interesting instruments were used as 'props'; James Iha can be seen using a Gibson harp guitar and D'arcy Wretzky is seen playing an <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> resembles the 1924 Gibson mandobass.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{influences}} of Greece and Rome, most musical instruments in Europe during the Middles Ages came from Asia. The lyre is the only musical <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> may have been invented in Europe until this period. Stringed instruments were prominent in Middle Age Europe. The central and northern regions used mainly lutes, stringed instruments with necks, while the southern region used lyres, which featured a two-armed body and a crossbar. Various harps served Central and Northern Europe {{as far north as}} Ireland, where the harp eventually became a national symbol. Lyres propagated through the same areas, as far east as Estonia.|$|E

5|$|Music {{and dance}} were popular {{entertainments}} {{for those who}} could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and imported lutes and lyres from Asia. The sistrum was a rattle-like musical <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> was especially important in religious ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Musical {{instrument}} {{construction is}} a specialized trade that requires years of training, practice, and sometimes an apprenticeship. Most makers of musical instruments specialize in one genre of instruments; for example, a luthier makes only stringed instruments. Some make only {{one type of}} instrument such as a piano. Whatever the instrument constructed, the instrument maker must consider materials, construction technique, and decoration, creating a balanced <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Some builders are focused on a more artistic approach and develop experimental musical instruments, often meant for individual playing styles developed by the builder himself.|$|E

5|$|One {{measure of}} an instrument's {{usefulness}} {{is to see}} how closely it agrees with another similar <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown {{to have a high}} one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).|$|E

Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups: the Sara prefer whistles, balafones, harps and kodjo drums; and the Kanembu combine the sounds of drums with those of flute-like instruments.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipe organ}} is a musical <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> {{produces}} sound by driving pressurized air (called wind) through organ pipes selected via a keyboard. Because each pipe produces a single pitch, the pipes {{are provided in}} sets called ranks, {{each of which has}} a common timbre and volume throughout the keyboard compass. Most organs have multiple ranks of pipes of differing timbre, pitch, and volume that the player can employ singly or in combination through the use of controls called stops.|$|E

5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism in an age that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E
5|$|In the {{accordion}} experiment, Home {{sat at a}} table, with Crookes and another observer {{on either side of}} him, each with a foot on one of Home's feet. Home inserted his hand inside a wire cage that was pushed under the table. One of Home's hands was placed {{on the top of the}} table, and the other inside the cage which held an accordion on the non-key side, so the keyed end was hanging downwards. The accordion was reported to have played musical sounds. However, the amount of light in the room was not stated, and {{the accordion}} was not observed in good light. According to Frank Podmore there was no evidence the accordion played at all, as the keys were not observed to have moved. Podmore suggested the musical sounds could have come from an automatic <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> Home had concealed.|$|E
5|$|The {{city also}} has three {{established}} music venues: the Guildhall, The Wedgewood Rooms (which includes a smaller venue, Edge of the Wedge), and Portsmouth Pyramids Centre. Portsmouth Guildhall, another theatrical venue, {{is one of}} the largest events venue in South East England, with a seating capacity of 2500. For many years a series of symphony concerts has been presented at the Guildhall by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. In the 1970s the Portsmouth Sinfonia approached classical music from a different angle: the Sinfonia often recruited players that had no musical training or, if they were musicians, ones that chose to play an <b>instrument</b> <b>that</b> was entirely new to them. The Portsmouth Summer Show is held at King George's Fields. The 2016 event was held in the last weekend of April, and featured cover bands such as the Silver Beatles, the Bog Rolling Stones, and Fleetingwood Mac.|$|E
