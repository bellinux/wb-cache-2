5|$|Few at {{the time}} {{realized}} <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>the</b> issue would become, with {{the absence of a}} bill of rights becoming the main argument of the anti-Federalists against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so {{there was no need to}} include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.|$|E
5|$|Here {{we can see}} <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>the</b> {{exemplary}} {{function of}} the primitive scientific structure is. In order to use the Euclidean system of geometry {{as a model for}} the development of astronomical theory, Ptolemy first had to select hypotheses which could serve as axioms. He naturally regarded circular motion as fundamental and then used the circular motion of deferents and epicycles in his earth-centered theory. Although Zhang Heng understood that the sun, moon and planets move in circles, he lacked a model for a logically structured theory and so could not establish a corresponding astronomical theory. Chinese astronomy was most interested in extracting the algebraic features of planetary motion (that is, the length of the cyclic periods) to establish astronomical theories. Thus astronomy was reduced to arithmetic operations, extracting common multiples and divisors from the observed cyclic motions of the heavenly bodies.|$|E

25|$|After the Second World War, the {{railroad}} industry's downturn and dwindling profits caused the PRR to stop subsidizing the LIRR, and the LIRR went into receivership in 1949. The State of New York, realizing <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>the</b> railroad was to Long Island's future, began to subsidize {{the railroad}} in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1966, New York State bought the railroad's controlling stock from the PRR and put it under the newly formed Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (renamed Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968). With MTA subsidies the LIRR modernized further, continuing to be the busiest commuter railroad in the United States.|$|E

Additionally, most districts within the province have all-weather paved roads and it is also one of the most productive agricultural regions in Afghanistan. ADT should further its progress within the provinces of Afghanistan in agricultural education, technical support, and logistics. To defeat the insurgency in Afghanistan public diplomacy is an essential force, ADTs help the US educate the population of Afghanistan with the hope of strengthening Afghan trust in the American mission in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The {{blue runner}} {{is a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout parts of its range. Due to its abundance, it {{may be one of}} the primary species in a fishery. The availability of fisheries statistics for the species is variable throughout its range, with the Americas having separate statistics kept for the species, while in Africa and Europe it is lumped in with other carangids in statistics. In the Americas, recent catch data suggests an increased amount of the species is being taken (or reported), with the 2006 and 2007 catch averaging between 6000 and 7000 tonnes, while during the 1980s and 1990s, there was rarely an annual catch greater than 1000 tonnes. Research on the fisheries of local regions has shown <b>how</b> <b>important</b> <b>the</b> fish is to certain fisheries. Artisanal fisheries in Santa Catarina Island have shown blue runner to be third most important and abundant species, making up 5.6% of landings, or 4.38 tonnes. Even subsistence fisheries at the edge of its range in Brazil show a catch of 388kg in two years from beach seines. Throughout its range the blue runner is commercially taken by haul seines, lampara nets, purse seines, gill nets, and hook and line methods. The fish is sold at market either fresh, dried, smoked or as fishmeal, oil or bait.|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} half of its first season, Fringe staff and critics noted that the series was still trying to define itself and its characters. The writers worked on {{balancing}} serialized storytelling with standalone plots and had to contend with continuous rewrites and expensive last-minute reshoots. For them, [...] "Safe" [...] marked {{a turning point in the}} series. They turned David Robert Jones into a recurring character and began to give Olivia more of a personal life.

We were trying to hedge our bets and trying to be too many kinds of shows at once. I'm not saying we got rid of the procedural element because each episode still is on a case – a case in terms of the quote-unquote police work — but it's not formulaic, not like the early episodes.

His review praised Tate's acting as Donna before she met the Doctor as a [...] "real character performance" [...] which exemplified Tate's multi-faceted portrayal.

[...] During one session, Parrish refused to follow the shooting script, having determined independently that not all the scripted scenes were essential to the plot.

[...] He noted in 1992 that most South African judges [...] "applied such [...] laws without commenting upon their moral turpitude." [...] A number, including Goldstone, were more outspoken – a policy that he felt aided the credibility of the courts.
