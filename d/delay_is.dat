5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay gratification {{depend on whether}} the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at {{the will of the}} person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying gratification. On the other hand, when the <b>delay</b> <b>is</b> externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|Sigmund Freud, {{the founder}} of psychoanalytic theory, {{discussed}} the ego's role in balancing the immediate pleasure-driven desires of the id with the morality-driven choices of the superego. Funder and Block expanded psychoanalytic research on the topic, and found that impulsivity, {{or a lack of}} ego-control, has a stronger effect on one's ability to delay rewards if a reward is more desirable. Finally, environmental and social factors play a role; for example, <b>delay</b> <b>is</b> affected by the self-imposed or external nature of a reward contingency, by the degree of task engagement required during the delay, by early mother-child relationship characteristics, by a person's previous experiences with unreliable promises of rewards (e.g., in poverty), and by contemporary sociocultural expectations and paradigms. Research on animals comprises another body of literature describing delayed gratification characteristics that are not as easily tested in human samples, such as ecological factors affecting the skill.|$|E
40|$|Four pigeons {{were exposed}} to a token-based {{self-control}} procedure with stimulus lights serving as token reinforcers. Smaller-reinforcer choices produced one token immediately; larger-reinforcer choices produced three tokens following a delay. Each token could be exchanged for 2 -s access to food during a signaled exchange period each trial. The main variables of interest <b>were</b> the exchange <b>delays</b> (delays from the choice to the exchange stimulus) and the food delays (also timed from the choice), which were varied separately and together across blocks of sessions. When exchange delays and food <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> shorter following smaller-reinforcer choices, strong preference for the smaller reinforcer was observed. When exchange delays and food <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> equal for both options, strong preference for the larger reinforcer was observed. When food <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> equal for both options but exchange <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> shorter for smaller-reinforcer choices, preference for the larger reinforcer generally was less extreme than under conditions in which both exchange and food <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> equal. When exchange <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> equal for both options but food <b>delays</b> <b>were</b> shorter for smaller-reinforcer choices, preference for the smaller reinforcer generally was less extreme than under conditions in which both exchange and food delays favored smaller-reinforcer choices. On the whole, the results were consistent with prior research on token-based self-control procedures in showing that choices are governed by reinforcer immediacy when exchange and food <b>delays</b> <b>are</b> unequal and by reinforcer amount when exchange and food <b>delays</b> <b>are</b> equal. Further, by decoupling the exchange delays from food delays, the results tentatively support a role for the exchange stimulus as a conditioned reinforcer...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Pulmonary {{tuberculosis}} {{continues to}} increase due to late patient presentation. The study was conducted at a chest clinic of a general hospital in Lagos, Nigeria, to investigate patterns of delays before treatment amongst tuberculosis patients. Methods Longitudinal recruitment using a health worker administered protocol to determine time interval from onset of symptoms to initiation of treatment. Presentation to a health facility after 30 days of the onset of symptoms was classified as patient <b>delay.</b> Doctor <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> when patients stayed for more than 15 days with the referring doctor. Results One hundred and forty-one patients were recruited. The mean age was 29. 5 ± 11. 0 years, 89 (63 %) were males and 52 (37 %) were females. One hundred and sixteen (82 %) had positive smears. One hundred and seventeen (83 %) delayed their seeking help from health facilities longer than {{one month after the}} onset of symptoms. The median patient <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> eight weeks; median doctor <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> one week, median treatment <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> one week and the median total <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> 10 weeks. Doctor <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> observed in 19 (13 %) patients. Patient <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> the most frequent type of <b>delay</b> observed and <b>was</b> the major contributor to the overall total <b>delay.</b> Patient <b>delay</b> <b>was</b> not significantly associated with patients' socio-demographic characteristics such as age, gender and educational level. Conclusion Majority of TB patients at this centre did not present early to health facilities and continue to serve as reservoirs of infection. Patient education on the disease may help reduce delays in starting treatment. </p...|$|R
5|$|Compared to neurotypical children, {{those with}} ADHD {{generally}} demonstrate greater impulsivity by being influenced by reward immediacy and quality more {{than by the}} frequency of reward and effort to obtain it. However, researchers have empirically shown that these impulsive behavior patterns can be changed through {{the implementation of a}} simple self-control training procedure in which reinforcer immediacy competes with the frequency, quantity or saliency of the reward, and the <b>delay</b> <b>is</b> gradually increased. One study demonstrated that any verbal activity while waiting for reinforcement increases delay to gratification in participants with ADHD. In another study, 3 children diagnosed with ADHD and demonstrating impulsivity were trained to prefer reward rate and saliency more than immediacy through manipulation {{of the quality of the}} reinforcers and by systematically increasing the delay with a changing-criterion design. Post-assessment of the children illustrated that self-control can transfer to untrained dimensions of reinforcement; such as an increase in quality over immediacy preference due to direct training resulting in an increase in quantity over immediacy preference.|$|E

25|$|Straight <b>delay</b> <b>is</b> used {{in sound}} {{reinforcement}} systems, a straight <b>delay</b> <b>is</b> used {{to compensate for}} the passage of sound through the air. Unlike audio delay effects devices, straight <b>delay</b> <b>is</b> not mixed back in with the original signal. The delayed signal alone is sent to loudspeakers so that the speakers distant from the stage, as in a large outdoor rock festival, will reinforce the stage sound at the same time or slightly later than the acoustic sound from the stage. The delayed signal uses approximately 1 millisecond of straight delay per foot of air or 3 milliseconds per meter, depending on the air temperature's effect on the speed of sound. Because of the Haas effect, this technique allows audio engineers to use additional speaker systems placed away from the stage and still give the illusion that all sound originates from the stage. The purpose is to deliver sufficient sound volume {{to the back of the}} venue without resorting to excessive sound volumes near the front. Straight <b>delay</b> <b>is</b> also used in audio to video synchronization to align sound with visual media (e.g., on TV or web broadcasting), if the visual source is delayed. Visual media can become delayed by a number of mechanisms or reasons, in which case the associated audio should be delayed to match the visual content.|$|E
