5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere negligence in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> on five counts, in both cases including one count of negligence, and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was <b>found</b> <b>guilty</b> of only one count of negligence but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E
