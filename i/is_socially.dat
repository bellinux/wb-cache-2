5|$|The Brander–Spencer {{model is}} an {{economic}} model in international trade originally developed by James Brander and Barbara Spencer in the early 1980s. The model illustrates a situation where, under certain assumptions, a government can subsidize domestic firms to help them in their competition against foreign producers {{and in doing so}} enhances national welfare. This conclusion stands in contrast to results from most international trade models, in which government non-interference <b>is</b> <b>socially</b> optimal.|$|E

5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science <b>is</b> <b>socially</b> constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|Like other white-eyes, {{the golden}} white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the golden white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The golden white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The golden white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the golden white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The golden white-eye <b>is</b> <b>socially</b> dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E
