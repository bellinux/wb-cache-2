5|$|In September 2007, Peace {{acquired}} additional {{shares in}} West Bromwich Albion Holdings Limited, taking his total {{stake in the}} company to 50.56%. This triggered a requirement, under the Takeover Code, for him to make a mandatory cash offer for the remaining shares in both WBA Holdings Ltd and WBA Ltd. Later that year, Michelle Davies became Albion's first female director. She, however, has since stepped down from this position. Jeremy Peace announced in June 2008 that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> major new investor for the club, but no firm proposals were received by 31 July deadline.|$|E
5|$|In some legends, Marko's wonder {{horse was}} a gift from a vila. A Serbian story says that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not move him. He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Å arac. He became an {{enormously}} powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend has it that Marko, following a vilas advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.|$|E
5|$|Cain started {{competing}} in 2007, {{and made the}} Australian national team the same year. During Australia's 2009 domestic series, the Australia Cup, an invitation-only series for the top shooters in the country, he earned a bronze, silver and gold medal. That year, he made his national team debut at an international event when he represented Australia at the 2009 ISSF World Cup in South Korea. By early 2010, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sponsor to assist with costs for his international competitions. He set a personal best of 598 out of 600 in the SH-2 prone air event at the 2010 World Cup in Germany, and not long after, set a new personal best when he shot 599 at the same event at the 2010 World Cup in France. He came in first at the 2010 Oceania Shooting Federation Continental Championship. At the 2010 IPC World Shooting Championships in Zagreb, he came in first in the SH-2 prone air event by setting a world record of 600 points, a perfect score.

5|$|In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an {{official}} company, now with a cash amount of US$350. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game and that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to another patient of his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1967 {{on the basis of}} Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success they needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as they had not had a hit game since. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer, as they had no real engineering team at the time. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he'd worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success.|$|E
5|$|The {{secondary}} rivalry {{was between}} The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. On the September 8, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, Kennedy announced that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new opponent, {{one that he}} had never faced before. Long informed Kennedy that he knew a SmackDown! superstar that had never faced Kennedy, The Undertaker. A match was made between the two for No Mercy, in which Kennedy defeated Undertaker by disqualification. At Survivor Series, Kennedy once again defeated Undertaker in a First Blood match. On the December 1 episode of SmackDown!, Undertaker fought Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a match where neither wrestler won. During the match, MVP was scripted to attempt escaping from the ring, but Kennedy caught him during the process and tried to throw him back into the ring. MVP instead threw Kennedy in. Undertaker then kicked Kennedy in the face, and Kane attacked MVP at ringside. The following week as Kennedy was in the ring, the hearse, appearing to have nobody in the driver's seat, drove into the arena; suddenly, The Undertaker appeared {{from the back of the}} hearse, as Kennedy sprung from the ring. Later that night, Kane defeated Kennedy by disqualification after MVP interfered on Kennedy's behalf. On the December 15 episode of SmackDown!, The Undertaker and Kane teamed together to face Kennedy and MVP in a tag team match, which ended in neither team winning. Kennedy knocked Kane down in the aisle and jumped into the driver's seat of the hearse that had been at ringside for the match, and threatened to run him over with it however the Undertaker appeared in the passenger side seat scaring Kennedy off.|$|E

25|$|Around 1975, Will Crowther, a {{programmer}} and an amateur caver, {{wrote the first}} text adventure game, Adventure (originally called ADVENT because a filename could only be six characters long in the operating system he was using, and later named Colossal Cave Adventure). Having just gone through a divorce, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> way to connect with his two young children. Over {{the course of a}} few weekends, he wrote a text based cave exploration game that featured a sort of guide/narrator who talked in full sentences and who understood simple two word commands that came close to natural English. Adventure was programmed in Fortran for the PDP-10. Crowther's original version was an accurate simulation of part of the real Colossal Cave, but also included fantasy elements (such as axe-wielding dwarves and a magic bridge).|$|E

500|$|Vargas Llosa's first {{literary}} influences {{were relatively}} obscure Peruvian {{writers such as}} MartÃ­n AdÃ¡n, Carlos Oquendo de Amat, and CÃ©sar Moro. As a young writer, he looked to these revolutionary novelists in search of new narrative structures and techniques in order to delineate a more contemporary, multifaceted experience of urban Peru. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> style different from the traditional descriptions of land and rural life made famous by Peru's foremost novelist at the time, JosÃ© MarÃ­a Arguedas. Vargas Llosa wrote of Arguedas's work that it was [...] "an example of old-fashioned regionalism that had already exhausted its imaginary possibilities". Although he did not share Arguedas's passion for indigenous reality, Vargas Llosa admired and respected the novelist for his contributions to Peruvian literature. Indeed, he has published a book-length study on his work, La utopÃ­a arcaica (1996).|$|E

In a retrospective interview, Satoru Iwata said that Miyamoto chose the music that sounded [...] "space-like" [...] because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> sound that would express the game, in contrast to the tropical sounds of Super Mario Bros. Yotaka revealed that he initially struggled to create music that sounded like a Super Mario game, but as time progressed he declared that the songs he made for the game had [...] "become natural".|$|E
