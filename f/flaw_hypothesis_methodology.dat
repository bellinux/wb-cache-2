50|$|The <b>flaw</b> <b>hypothesis</b> <b>methodology</b> of {{penetration}} testing includes {{three types of}} tests: open-box testing, black-box testing, and grey-box testing. Black-box testing is concerned only about the expected result of a software program and does not examine how the software program is coded to produce the expected result. Open-box testing or white-box testing focuses specifically on using the internal knowledge of the software. In white-box testing, a security firm is provided with a production-like test environment, login details, production documentation, and source code. Grey-box testing includes testing algorithms, architectures, or other high-level descriptions of the program code. Grey-box testing is performed by security professionals with limited inside knowledge of the network.|$|E

40|$|Military {{electronics}} rely on commodity processors, many {{of which}} are manufactured overseas where the trustworthiness of the foundries is uncertain. This thesis attempts to answer the question of whether common bus protocols in use today differ significantly with respect to security, by conducting an analysis of common integrated circuit bus protocols (Inter-Integrated Circuit [I 2 C], Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture [AMBA], HyperTransport, Wishbone, and CoreConnect) based on the <b>Flaw</b> <b>Hypothesis</b> <b>Methodology</b> (FHM). This thesis follows the four stages of FHM. The first stage is Flaw Generation, which involves creating hypothetical attack scenarios. The next is Flaw Confirmation, which involves confirming the flaws generated in the first stage through analysis of the specifications of the bus architectures as well as testing and research in the literature. The third stage is Flaw Generalization, which evaluates the impact of each flaw to determine whether it suggests that a more serious flaw exists in that bus architecture. The final stage is Flaw Elimination, which identifies strategies (and their costs) for mitigating the vulnerabilities based on techniques in the hardware security literature. We conclude that the bus architectures we analyzed differ significantly with respect to security. Lieutenant Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are {{characterized}} by the interplay between digital and physical spaces. This characteristic has extended the attack surface that could be exploited by an offender to cause harm. An increasing number of cyber-physical incidents may occur depending on {{the configuration of the}} physical and digital spaces and their interplay. Traditional investigation processes are not adequate to investigate these incidents, as they may overlook the extended attack surface resulting from such interplay, leading to relevant evidence being missed and testing <b>flawed</b> <b>hypotheses</b> explaining the incidents. The software engineering research community can contribute to addressing this problem, by deploying existing formalisms to model digital and physical spaces, and using analysis techniques to reason about their interplay and evolution. In this paper, supported by a motivating example, we describe some emerging software engineering challenges to support investigations of cyber-physical incidents. We review and critique existing research proposed to address these challenges, and sketch an initial solution based on a meta-model to represent cyber-physical incidents and a representation of the topology of digital and physical spaces that supports reasoning about their interplay...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{behavior of}} boron/aluminum near stress risers {{has been studied}} and reported. This effort was directed toward defining the tensile behavior of both unidirectional and (0 / plus or minus 45) boron/aluminum using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM). The material used was 5. 6 -mil boron in 6061 aluminum, consolidated using conventional diffusion bonding techniques. Mechanical properties are reported for both unidirectional and (0 / plus or minus 45) boron/aluminum, which serve as control data for the fracture mechanics predictions. Three different flawed specimen types were studied. In each case the series of specimens remained geometrically similar to eliminate variations in finite size correction factors. The fracture data from these tests were reduced using two techniques. They both used conventional LEFM methods, but {{the existence of a}} characteristic flaw was assumed in one case and not the other.

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{failure to}} improve outcome of septic {{patients}} may reflect <b>flawed</b> <b>hypotheses</b> {{pertaining to the}} pathogenesis of sepsis. Alternatively, it may represent the use of clinically irrelevant experimental animal models. To address these issues, an alternative hypothesis is proposed. It is suggested that leukocyte activa-tion in sepsis is initiated by a priming effect of minuscule doses of endotoxin on leukocytes for enhanced re-sponsiveness to minute doses of inflammatory mediators (or vice versa) as opposed to activation by overwhelming doses of endotoxin per se. The experimental impetus of this hypothesis has been provided by a novel rat model of sepsis precipitated by the co-administration of PAF and LPS at doses 1 / 1000 lower than those previously used to elicit sepsis in the same species. Definitions of sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock To facilitate sepsis research {{there is a need}} to uniformly define the spectrum of disorders associated with this disease.

50|$|The {{history of}} Ibeku {{can be traced}} through present-day culture, {{tradition}} (omenala) and heritage, archives, archeology and various methods used in organization of its people. The lack and in places paucity of data has tended to encourage unrestrained speculation which in fact largely accounts for some insupportable hypotheses being put forward by many early or pioneer archaeologists, concerning the nature of culture change in Ibeku, Umuahia-Ibeku,eastern Nigeria. One of such <b>flawed</b> <b>hypotheses</b> was that the peopling of the forest region (southern Nigeria and indeed, all of the Guinea zone of West Africa) was a much later development {{than that of the}} northern open savanna area. Recent archaeological research has shown that people were already living in south-western Nigeria (specifically Iwo-Eleru) as early as 9000 BC and perhaps earlier at Ugwuelle-Uturu (Okigwe) in south-eastern Nigeria (Shaw and Daniels 1984: 7-100). This is the area of Ibeku clan. Lack of adequate funding and dating facilities has also caused a lag in archaeological research in ibeku area of Nigeria and indeed, all of West Africa. Many sites threatened by construction work such as bridges, roads, houses and dams are not normally rescued because there are no sources of funding. The governments both state and federal have not been supportive enough of archaeological work, partly because both the leaders and the peoples do not recognize the role a sound knowledge of the past can play in nation-building.|$|R

40|$|Abstract While {{improved}} drug regimens {{have greatly}} enhanced outcomes {{for patients with}} chronic viral infection, antiviral therapy is still not ideal due to drug toxicities, treatment costs, primary drug failure and emergent resistance. New antiviral agents, alternative treatment strategies and {{a better understanding of}} viral pathobiology, host responses and drug action are desperately needed. Interferon (IFN) and ribavirin, are effective drugs used to treat hepatitis C (HCV), but the mechanism(s) of their action are uncertain. Error catastrophe (EC), or precipitous loss of replicative fitness caused by genomic mutation, is postulated to mediate ribavirin action, but is a deeply <b>flawed</b> <b>hypothesis</b> lacking empirical confirmation. Paradoxically ribavirin, a proven RNA mutagen, has no impact on HCV viraemia long term, suggesting real viruses, replicating in-vitro, as opposed to mathematical models, replicating in-silico, are likely to resist EC by highly selective replication of fit (~consensus sequence) genomes mediated, in part, by replicative homeostasis (RH), an epicyclic mechanism that dynamically links RNApol fidelity and processivity and other viral protein functions. Replicative homeostasis provides a rational explanation for the various responses seen during treatment of HCV, including genotype-specific and viral load-dependent differential response rates, as well as otherwise unexplained phenomena like the transient inhibition and rebound of HCV viraemia seen during ribavirin monotherapy. Replicative homeostasis also suggests a primarily non-immunological mechanism that mediates increased immune responsiveness during treatment with ribavirin (and other nucleos(t) ide analogues), explicating the enhanced second-phase clearance of HCV ribavirin promotes and, thus, the apparent immunomodulatory action of ribavirin. More importantly, RH suggests specific new antiviral therapeutic strategies. </p...|$|R
