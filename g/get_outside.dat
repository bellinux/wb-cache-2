25|$|Beginning in July 1974, Kallinger and his 15-year-old son Michael {{went on a}} crime spree {{spanning}} Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New Jersey. Over {{the next}} six weeks, they robbed, assaulted, and sexually abused four families and murdered three people, gaining entrance to each house by pretending to be salesmen. On January 8, 1975, they continued their spree in Leonia, New Jersey. Using a pistol and a knife, they overpowered and tied up the three residents. Then, when others entered the home, {{they were forced to}} strip and bound with cords from lamps and other appliances. This culminated in the killing of 21-year-old nurse Maria Fasching, the eighth person to arrive, when she reprimanded Kallinger and he responded by slitting her throat. Finally, another of the residents, still bound, managed to <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> and cry for help. Neighbors saw her and called the police, but by the time they arrived the Kallingers had fled, using the city bus as their getaway vehicle and dumping their weapons and a bloody shirt along the way.|$|E
500|$|For the film, Hughes got {{the chance}} to take a more {{expansive}} look at the city he grew up in. [...] "We took a helicopter up the Chicago River. This is the first chance I'd really had to <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> while making a movie. Up to this point, the pictures had been pretty small. I really wanted to capture as much of Chicago as I could, not just the architecture and the landscape, but the spirit." ...|$|E

Perry defeats Doofenshmirtz without catching {{the attention of the}} three and the water washes away Candace's toilet paper. When they <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> to meet up with their father, Phineas is dumbfounded as to where their mummy went, but Lawrence thinks he is simply referring to their mother and they get into the car. As they ride off, Ferb explains the process of mummification and Candace says that only the [...] "lucky [...] " [...] get the full process.|$|E

500|$|Production {{began in}} February 2007 in South Africa, where the {{majority}} of filming took place. South Africa was chosen as a primary filming location for economic reasons, costing a third of estimated production in the United Kingdom. Shooting in South Africa lasted 56 days out of 66 days, with the remaining ten taking place in Scotland. Marshall said of South Africa's appeal, [...] "The landscape, the rock formations, I thought it was about as close to Scotland as you're likely to <b>get,</b> <b>outside</b> of Ireland or Wales." [...] In Scotland, secondary filming took place in the city of Glasgow, including Haghill in the city's East End, and at Blackness Castle in West Lothian, the latter chosen when filmmakers were unable to shoot at Doune Castle. The entire shoot, involving thousands of extras, included a series of complex fight scenes and pyrotechnical displays. The director sought to minimise the use of computer-generated elements in Doomsday, preferring to subscribe to [...] "old-school filmmaking". In the course of production, several sequences were dropped due to budgetary concerns, including a scene in which helicopter gunships attacked a medieval castle.|$|E
500|$|After realizing Lincoln's mother (Christina Scofield) took Scylla, Mahone {{helps him}} stop her and {{retrieve}} Scylla after the Company threatens {{him with a}} photo of Pam. He later saves Lincoln from being assassinated by one of Christina's snipers. Mahone identifies {{one of the people}} who have connections with Christina, Vincent Sandinsky. The team does not find any connections with him and he believes his story. They catch him in the lie; after Krantz arrives to take charge they interrogate Sandinsky, who reveals some information about a hotel room. He and the team track a car rental slip and after more digging, eventually find the car (with their passports) outside the energy conference; they realize it is a set-up. It is revealed that Christina is setting the team up for the assassination of the Indian Prime Minister's son (who was thought to have brought Scylla). After the assassination of Naveen Banarjee, Mahone and Self are outside the hotel on the phone with Scofield and Burrows. The brothers tell Mahone to go the apartment where Sara is holding Christina hostage, and make Christina talk by any means necessary. Mahone goes to the apartment, finding only Sara tied up and gagged; he unties Sara and heads back to the loft, where the General and T-Bag are. Mahone, Michael and Lincoln then head to a bank, where they believe Christina is with Scylla. They enter the bank wearing masks, to avoid being recognized. They take Scylla, and when they <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> a shootout begins. Mahone and Michael get away, but Linc is caught.|$|E

I hate going to the gym, so sweating outdoors sure beats sitting on a stationary bike staring at my navel. And I work cheaper than anyone I could hire to do it."

2500|$|Swami Vivekananda {{compared}} {{human mind}} with a monkey {{who is always}} restless and incessantly active by his own nature. He noticed, the human mind naturally wants to <b>get</b> <b>outside,</b> to peer out of the body, as it were, through the channels of the organs. So, he stressed on practice of concentration, as he felt there is no limit {{to the power of}} the human mind, the more concentrated it is, the more powerful it becomes. [...] Swami Vivekananda suggested not to do anything which disturbs the mind or makes it restless.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the album's title, Welch told MTV News, [...] "It {{was an art}} {{installation}} done in the '70s, {{this video}} piece all done on Super 8, this big procession of kind of coquette-style hippies and all these different colored robes and masks, {{and it was all}} to do with color, really saturated, brightly colored pastas and balloons. I saw it a couple years ago, and it was called 'Ceremonials' and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of stuck with me, and I think the whole idea of performance, and kind of putting on this outfit and going out almost to find some sort of exorcism or absolution, to kind of <b>get</b> <b>outside</b> yourself, there's a sense of ceremony to it." [...] Welch also revealed that she wanted to call the album Violence, stating, [...] "I wanted to make an album that sounded like the soundtrack to Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet, the violence mixed with the classical Shakespearean drama mixed with the pop and the pulp, extreme neon stuff." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, she described the album as [...] "much bigger" [...] and categorised its genre as [...] "chamber soul", a mixture of chamber pop and soul. The liner notes of Ceremonials contain an essay by English writer Emma Forrest, dated 21 September 2011.|$|E
