40|$|The {{present study}} {{focuses on the}} need for {{reviewing}} the Regulation (EC) nr. 44 / 2001 on removing <b>exequatur</b> <b>procedure.</b> On the basis of removing this special procedure it lays the Commission's report and the Green Book on applying the rule. It was meant to be within the legal framework of Europeanization of civil procedure and so far it has proved to be an effective instrument for settling litigations emerged in the Member States of the European Union. The rule is the "Queen" of community legislation as regards the procedure in civil and commercial matter in transboundary litigations. However, in applying the Rule {{it was found that the}} given judgments in a Member State are not “rightfully” recognized, but it was needed to go through the <b>exequatur</b> <b>procedure,</b> which differs from one Member State to another; it requires costs and time that prevent the creditor to recover its claim within a reasonable time. Therefore, the report on revising the Regulation and the Green Book has proposed, among others, the elimination of the <b>exequatur</b> <b>procedure</b> (granting enforcement) on passing judgments in the Member States of the European Union. However, eliminating this procedure requires the maintenance of procedural guarantees, such as special review, for fulfilling the protection right of the defendant. Regarding the special review, we consider that it is needed to focus on legislation harmonization of EU member states, in order to have a good judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters, so that the European citizens enjoy equal legal treatment in the courts of the Member States...|$|E
40|$|In the {{decision}} n. 16379 / 2014, the Italian Supreme Court states that {{three years of}} conjugal life is an obstacle to the <b>exequatur</b> <b>procedure</b> of the ecclesiastical sentences of nullity of marriage. This statement has already been supported by other decisions taken by the Court during 2015 and has de facto determined a new public policy, valid only for ecclesiastical sentences but not, for example, applicable to judgments made abroad. This new public policy is more restrictive than both the international public policy and the Italian public policy...|$|E
40|$|Some {{reflections}} on the reform of the <b>exequatur</b> <b>procedure</b> in Italy. Legislative Decree 1 September 2011 n. 150 has changed the <b>exequatur</b> <b>procedure</b> in force in Italy stating that this procedure should be celebrated {{according to the rules}} of the "rite summary of cognition" under Chapter III bis of Title I of Book IV of the Civil Procedure Code. It remains, however, the competence in a single grade of the Court of Appeals with jurisdiction on the place of implementation of the foreign decision. This reform brings some obvious difficulties on which the author focuses both for the literal interpretation of the new regulations and to ensure proper systematic reconstruction of the general framework. This framework, in fact, is very complex because, in Italy, in the area of exequatur, should be duly taken into account, in addition to the common regulation, the various special regulations posed as implementation of international obligations and / or regulations - still binding for the Italian courts - posed by the European Union; all enjoying these regulations, although for different reasons, a force of privileged incidence on internal legislation in force of the principle of primacy of EU law over national law or {{as a result of the}} principles now (since 2001) consecrated in the art. 117, 1 st co., Const. As is known, in fact, these principles will last, first and foremost, an obligation of conforming interpretation and, in the case of unresolvable antinomy in terms of interpretation, the unconstitutionality of the internal "common" rules that may be in conflict with the "international obligations" or with '"Community law". Hence the discussion of the various profiles indicated and, in particular, the problem of appeal to the Supreme Court for the judicial decisions that will be issued by the Italian Courts of Appeal on the basis of the new procedural rules...|$|E
5000|$|The European Enforcement Order is {{a method}} of {{enforcing}} foreign judgments within the European Union without the need of any intermediate proceedings, such as <b>exequatur.</b> The <b>procedure</b> was established by Council Regulation (EC) 805/2004 of 21 April 2004 and came into force on 21 October 2005. The EEO is applicable only in relation to uncontested claims. Uncontested claims are defined in Article 3 of the regulation {{as one of the}} following: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{reform of}} the canon law {{marriage}} process contained in the M. P. Mitis Iudex Dominus Iesus {{and in particular the}} introduction of the processus brevior prompt reflection on the prognosis of the <b>exequatur</b> <b>procedures</b> of ecclesiastical judgments of nullity of marriage granted with the new process model. This study sets out to exclude the ontological incompatibility of the processus brevior with respect to the requirements to guarantee protection of the right of defence, procedural public order and fair trial, which are essential for the national judicial system. In order to demonstrate the assumption, the most recent innovations introduced by the state legislature are analysed and, in particular, the summarization of the cognitive activity of the civil judge. The essay also seeks to highlight how the increasing hostility towards the admission of ecclesiastical decrees in the legal system of the Italian Republic displayed, over recent times, by national judges, is based on partial and not always constitutionally consistent readings of the sovereignty and secularity of the State that imply discriminatory treatment for believers. In fact, the denied exequatur leads to an irremediable conflict of the individual conscience and represents damage to the inviolable right of religious freedom for civisfideles who, faced with the failure of their marriage, intend to avoid resorting to the dissolution of the civil effects of the bond inevitably acquiring, in that case, the status of being divorced, which is incompatible with their religious beliefs. In conclusion, the study intends to illustrate how the protection of the inviolable rights of freedom of belief and religious freedom of believers must not disregard respect for the agreements, obtained in a pactional way by the Italian Republic and the Catholic Church, while they were in force...|$|R
40|$|The book is {{dedicated}} to the study of trans-boundary and European insolvency procedures and represents a relevant and useful instrument in the analysis of the international, European and national policies with reference to judicial cooperation in the field of the insolvency procedures. In particular, the work faces in deepened and exhaustive way the topic of the insolvency of debtors whose entrepreneurial activities is localised in more than one legal order, supplying a critical reconstruction of the European discipline setting up autonomous rules concerning jurisdiction and recognition and enforcement of foreign insolvency decisions. In order to bring on a systematic study of the problem, the volume is subdivided in three sections, respectively devoted to the analysis of i) the national and international models that can represent a reference in order to prepare an independent discipline dedicated to the trans-boundary insolvency, ii) the Regulation 1346 / 2000 and iii) national rules of the Italian legal order. In {{the first part of the}} book – Chapter I - the Author takes care of the techniques that have been employed in order to rule the insolvency of an enterprise having cross-border characters, verifying that, on the one hand, the traditional models of the “universality” and “territoriality” are not employed in “pure” forms in any legal order and that, on the other hand, there are many obstacles to the full realization of the universal vocation inborn in every insolvency discipline (that is aimed to guarantee the par condicio creditorum principle). Then, the Author analyses the positive and negative aspects of the so called “limited universality”, that represents the outline which currently inspires the most recent rulings both at the international and national level. Such a theory allows a connection between the different jurisdictions of the interested States with the insolvency, without imposing the opening of a sole procedure with universal effects, but concurring the slope of parallel proceedings by coordinating their effects. The universality in the limited form presupposes that the procedure opened in the country in which the centre of the main interests of the debtor is localised has main character and can have universal character, but this does not forbid the opening of local proceedings in the States in which another seat of the enterprise in crisis is found. Chapter II {{is dedicated}} to the study of national rules inspired by the limited universality principle, as well as to the analysis of the instruments created in order to favour the acceptance of such a model by national legislators (i. e. the Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency and the Concordat of the International Bar Association). Among them, common law legal orders are taken in consideration (UK and USA), as well as civil law legislations (Switzerland, Germany and France). The Second Part of the monograph is devoted to the European common discipline of the insolvency and, in particular, to the analysis of Regulations 1346 / 2000 on insolvency procedures. Chapter III examines the evolution of the European judicial area that has brought to the adoption of the Regulation, emphasizing the reasons of the European Community intervention in this field. The following Chapters IV and V are dedicated to the deep analysis of the Regulation itself. To such purpose, detailed attention is given to the notion of “centre of the main interests” of the debtor and “establishment”, definitions relevant in order to operate the bipartition, made by the Regulation, between main and territorial-secondary insolvency procedures. Concerning recognition and enforcement of decisions rendered within the insolvency proceeding, the principle of mutual confidence that print the relationships between the Member States of the European Community is recalled. Such a principle has carried to the affirmation of the automatic recognition of decisions coming from European judges in civil and commercial matters, comprised those concerning bankruptcy. In the event in which decisions are wanted to produce their executive effects, it is said that the judge of the demanded State must always proceed to a preventive verification on the content and on the way of formation of the decision emitted in another EU State, exam that has to be brought on following the <b>exequatur</b> <b>procedure</b> verification set forth by Regulations 44 / 2001. The Third Part of the book, finally, {{is dedicated to}} the discipline of the insolvency in the Italian legal order, taking into account both rules contained in the bankrupt law and those introduced by private international law act (law 218 / 95). in this seat it is stressed the difficult coordination to which the interpreter is called upon when he has to face a cross-border insolvency case: in fact, while within the scope of application of Regulation 1346 / 2000 the main insolvency proceeding potentially has universal character, hypotheses that are not included in that scope of application remain subject to the rigid territorialistic principle that inspires the bankruptcy law of 1942 (that has not been modified yet). Chapter VI, therefore, proposes a new reading that, in an interpretative way, reconciles the conflicts gushing from the differences inspiring the different rules concerning jurisdiction and insolvency procedures with reference to the Italian legal order...|$|E
