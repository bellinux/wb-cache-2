5|$|However, when {{a country}} is {{suffering}} from high unemployment or wishes to pursue a policy of export-led growth, a lower exchange rate {{can be seen as}} advantageous. From the early 1980s the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has proposed <b>devaluation</b> as a potential solution for developing nations that are consistently spending more on imports than they earn on exports. A lower value for the home currency will raise the price for imports while making exports cheaper. This tends to encourage more domestic production, which raises employment and gross domestic product (GDP) – though the effect may not be immediate due to the Marshall–Lerner condition. <b>Devaluation</b> can be seen as an attractive solution to unemployment when other options, like increased public spending, are ruled out due to high public debt, or when a country has a balance of payments deficit which a <b>devaluation</b> would help correct. A reason for preferring <b>devaluation</b> common among emerging economies is that maintaining a relatively low exchange rate helps them build up foreign exchange reserves, which can protect against future financial crises.|$|E

5|$|Duhalde, Alfonsín, their parties, {{the unions}} and the Church all agreed to promote {{policies}} {{to increase the}} industrial growth of the country. For this purpose, Duhalde created the ministry of production, with functions that used {{to belong to the}} ministries of economy and foreign relations. The new minister was José Ignacio de Mendiguren, head of the Argentine Industrial Union. Alfonsín negotiated with him, on Duhalde's behalf, while Congress was still voting for the new president. Duhalde announced at his inauguration that he would repeal the convertibility plan, considered the main cause of the economic crisis. Although Menem proposed a full dollarization of the Argentine economy, Duhalde preferred to instead stick to the peso and order a <b>devaluation.</b> Although it was initially expected to make a 40% <b>devaluation,</b> the exchange rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar jumped to 3 pesos to 1 dollar, a 200% <b>devaluation.</b> The higher dollar price allowed for more lucrative exports, increased economic activity and a growth in the employment rates, but at the cost of a higher cost of living.|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} large {{currency}} <b>devaluations</b> on output, {{as measured by}} the real gross domestic product, continues to be an elusive question in the empirical macroeconomic literature. This paper aims at re-examining and providing new empirical evidence on this relationship, by using a sample covering 109 emerging market and developing economies for the period 1960 - 2006. In contrast with the existing empirical literature, we examine not just the impact of large nominal currency <b>devaluations</b> on output growth, as has been customary in the literature, but also provide estimates of how devaluationary episodes affect output trend. By doing so, we find that the devaluation-output relationship is not robust across regions and time, and that the persistence of <b>devaluations</b> matters. In particular, one-time <b>devaluations</b> induce output trend gains at ten year horizons, while successive devaluationary episodes have no impact whatsoever. A policy implication is that poorly executed <b>devaluations</b> induce no long-run output gains. Finally, the role of the external sector in explaining the heterogeneity of the results is examined. We find that real imports rather than exports do most of the adjustment, thus suggesting a strong expenditure-switching effect and, possibly, the emergence of export financing constraints at the time of <b>devaluations.</b> This last aspect highlights the need to avoid a credit crunch at the time of large currency <b>devaluations</b> as it might wipe out all the beneficial gains that <b>devaluations</b> may have on exports and, ultimately, on output...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{and theoretical}} {{literature on the}} impact of real exchange rate <b>devaluations</b> on economic performance questions the traditional expansionary effect generated within standard Mundell-Fleming models. Contractionary <b>devaluations</b> may arise when firms face maturity or currency mismatches that, when faced with real exchange rate depreciations, lead to balance-sheet effects that erode firms' wealth and lead to an output contraction. While some authors show that the standard Mundell-Fleming result may hold even in the presence of currency mismatches, others point out that, if the balance sheet effect is large enough, <b>devaluations</b> can be contractionary. Using a large panel of 57 countries across the world and various newly constructed measures of dollarization, we test whether the balance sheet effect hypothesis has been relevant during the past decades in explaining economic downturns. Additionally, we explore the channels through which <b>devaluations</b> can be contractionary; in particular, we explore whether investment and consumption decisions are negatively affected by exchange rate <b>devaluations</b> under currency mismatches...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} how <b>devaluations</b> affect the relative cost {{of labor and}} capital and therefore influence production levels, profitability, investment decisions, and stock returns for firms in the “crisis ” country as well as competitors {{in the rest of}} the world. The paper develops these ideas in a small, open-economy model and then performs a series of empirical tests using information for about 1, 100 firms in 10 commodity industries between 1996 and 2000. The empirical tests support the model’s main predictions. 1) Immediately after <b>devaluations,</b> firms in the crisis country have higher rates of output growth than competitors in other countries; 2) Immediately after <b>devaluations,</b> firms in the crisis country have higher rates of operating-profit growth than competitors in other countries; 3) The effect of <b>devaluations</b> on fixed capital investment and stock returns (and therefore expected long-term output and profits) is determined by capital/labor ratios and changes in the cost of capital. For example, crisis-country firms have higher rates of capital growth and better stock performance after <b>devaluations</b> if they had lower capital/labor ratios and there was no substantial increase in their interest rates. Even though crisiscountry firms may benefit from cheaper labor immediately after <b>devaluations,</b> competitors in other countries may benefit in the long run if firms in the devaluing country used capital intensively and/or their capital becomes more costly.

40|$|We analyze empirically for Brazil a {{hypothesis}} by Stiglitz (2002) saying that <b>devaluations</b> {{may be more}} effective in reducing trade deficits than cuts in budget deficits. We find that the Ricardian equivalence does not hold. <b>Devaluations</b> have a stronger impact on the trade deficit than budget deficits when doing the analysis with yearly or monthly data even when the effect from a risk variable obtained from a TARCH estimate is subtracted. <b>Devaluations</b> have an effect that lasts 25 months. A J-or W-curve can be obtained from a polynomial distributed lag estimate. <b>Devaluations</b> can explain almost 19 % of consumer price inflation. However, if inflation control is a task assigned to monetary policy rather than exchange rate policy, <b>devaluations</b> are available as an instrument to stabilize the trade balance under shocks rather than keeping exchange rates fixed through sales of reserves. This may avoid overvaluations, speculative attacks and currency crises. The results for the trade balance hold for several updates except for the last one, where budget deficits and exchange rate changes change signs. This suggests a role for imported investments and elasticity pessimism and casts doubts on the role of cutting budget deficits and <b>devaluations</b> in regard to the trade balance. Stability tests suggest that structural change seems to play a role. The change in signs of our estimates may have been caused by a change of exchange rate policies leading to appreciations since June 2004 and by an extraordinarily strong industrial recession in 2003 in some countries. If Ricardian equivalence for the trade balance is imposed by assumption we find a weakly significant N-curve for exchange rate risk jointly with a J-curve for <b>devaluations.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|The {{economy of}} Belarus {{has been in}} a state of flux since Lukashenko's {{election}} in 1994. His economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other former Soviet states, such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and mass unemployment. The unemployment rate for the country at the end of 2011 was at 0.6% of the population (of 6.86million eligible workers), a decrease from 1995, when unemployment was 2.9% with a working-eligible population of 5.24million. The per-capita Gross national income rose from US$1,423 in 1993 to US$5,830 at the end of 2011. One major economic issue Lukashenko faced throughout his presidency was the value of the Belarusian ruble. For a time it was pegged to major foreign currencies, such as the euro, US dollar and the Russian ruble {{in order to maintain the}} stability of the Belarusian ruble. Yet, the currency has experienced free fall and also several rounds of <b>devaluation.</b> A major <b>devaluation</b> took place in 2011 after the government announced that average salaries would increase to US$500. The 2011 <b>devaluation</b> was the largest on record for the past twenty years according to the World Bank. Belarus also had to seek a bailout from international sources, and while it has received loans from China, receiving loans from the IMF and other agencies depend on how Belarus reforms its economy according to standards set by the IMF and other agencies.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The <b>devaluation</b> of the peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} whether nominal <b>devaluations</b> had real output growth effects in Mexico and, if so, to assess the significance and duration of such effects. A random coefficient regression model to evaluate the output growth effects of 1976, 1982 and 1986 <b>devaluations</b> using sectoral data from 1970 to 1991 is specified and estimated. The results indicate unambiguous short-term contractionary effects of <b>devaluations</b> on non-agricultural output in Mexico. In addition, it is found that adjustments to imbalances in the external sector invariably came from temporary contractions in the aggregate output rather than significant resource reallocation from the non-tradable sector towards the tradable sector. Several transmission mechanisms that relate nominal exchange rate movements to real output fluctuations are also considered. ...|$|R

It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E
