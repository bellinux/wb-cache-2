5|$|Cumberbatch {{featured}} in Michael Dobbs' play, The Turning Point, which aired {{as one of}} a series of TV plays broadcast live on Sky Arts. The play depicted an October 1938 meeting between Soviet spy Guy Burgess, then a young man working for the BBC, and Winston Churchill. Cumberbatch portrayed Burgess; Churchill was played by Matthew Marsh, who <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> supporting role in Hawking. He narrated the 6-part series South Pacific (US title: Wild Pacific), which aired from May to June 2009 on BBC 2.|$|E

5|$|David Cameron criticised the Labour Government's {{criminal}} justice system {{and the absence of}} father-figures in ethnic minority cultures, which he claimed as causes in the murder of Pryce. Cameron stated that lack of strong deterrent sentences for knife crimes and the failure of police to stop prolific criminals <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> role in the killing of Pryce. He insisted that parental background had a key role in preventing crime and called for zero tolerance of knife crime, claiming that not enough criminals were being sent to jail.|$|E
5|$|Distrusted by {{his colleagues}} {{because of his}} {{tendency}} to change sides and his reputation as an intriguer, Khánh was assigned to I Corps in the far north of the country after Diệm's overthrow to keep {{him away from the}} capital Saigon. Khánh, who <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> minor role in Diệm's overthrow, joined forces with Generals Trần Thiện Khiêm, Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, who felt they deserved better posts in the junta, and Colonels Nguyễn Chánh Thi and Đỗ Mậu, the latter being the director of military security under Diệm and an effective strategist.|$|E
5|$|Domitian {{opened the}} year {{following}} the revolt by sharing the consulship with Nerva. Again, the honour suggested Nerva <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> part in uncovering the conspiracy, {{perhaps in a}} fashion similar to what he did during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero. Alternatively, Domitian may have selected Nerva as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status-quo of the regime. The revolt had been suppressed, and the Empire could return to order.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Kogălniceanu began {{printing}} {{the magazine}} Steaua Dunării in Iași: a unionist mouthpiece, it enlisted support from Alecsandri and his România Literară. Kogălniceanu encouraged Nicolae Ionescu {{to issue the}} magazine L'Étoile de Danube in Brussels, as a French-language version of Steaua Dunării which would also serve to popularize Partida Naționalăs views. By that time, he was in correspondence with Jean Henri Abdolonyme Ubicini, a French essayist and traveler who <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> minor part in the Wallachian uprising, and who supported the Romanian cause in his native country.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1949, Nixon {{embarked}} on a putatively nonpolitical speaking tour of Northern California, where he was less well known, to see if his candidacy would be well received if he ran. With many of his closest advisers urging him to do so, Nixon decided in early October to seek the Senate seat. He hired a professional campaign manager, Murray Chotiner, who had helped to run successful campaigns for both Governor Warren and Senator Knowland and <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> limited role in Nixon's first congressional race.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of its history, Norwich City has survived a number of {{incidents}} that threatened its survival, including ousting from amateur football, {{the need to be}} re-elected to The Football League and financial crises. Geoffrey Watling, who was to become club Chairman and after whom a stand at the club's stadium, Carrow Road is named, was instrumental in saving the club from bankruptcy, both in the 1950s and 1990s; his father <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> similar role in 1919.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} nineteenth century, the {{emphasis}} of Imperial defence policy had shifted from a single centralised Army and Navy to an approach whereby the self-governing Dominions began to provide forces for their own defence, and to begin {{to take responsibility for}} strategic interests and bases in their own geographic areas. The culmination of this was the South African War, where contingents from the Dominion militaries <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> significant role.|$|E
5|$|Lappius Maximus {{received}} the governorship {{of the province}} of Syria, a second consulship in May 95, and finally a priesthood, which he still held in 102. Titus Flavius Norbanus may have been appointed to the prefecture of Egypt, but almost certainly became prefect of the Praetorian Guard by 94, with Titus Petronius Secundus as his colleague. Domitian opened the year following the revolt by sharing the consulship with Marcus Cocceius Nerva, suggesting the latter <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> part in uncovering the conspiracy, perhaps in a fashion {{similar to the one}} he played during the Pisonian conspiracy under Nero.|$|E

5|$|Ponce Vaides {{was allowed}} {{to leave the country}} safely, as was Ubico himself. The {{military}} junta was replaced by another three-person junta consisting of Árbenz, Arana, and an upper-class youth named Jorge Toriello, who <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> significant role in the protests. Although Arana had come to the military conspiracy relatively late, his defection had brought the powerful Guardia de Honor (Honor Guard) over to the revolutionaries, and for this crucial role he was rewarded with a place on the junta. The junta promised free and open elections to the presidency and the congress, as well as for a constituent assembly.|$|E
5|$|The Rochefoucaulds, who <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{major role}} in the fight against the English, now began to ravish Angoulême. Charles VII returned, and this time {{destroyed}} the castle, largely by fire. However, the stones were recovered and the castle rebuilt. In 1446 the Rochefoucaulds managed to obtain the king's pardon and permission to build a defensive wall and two towers in Verteuil to restore the traditional refuge of the villagers. Under this pretext they made the castle among the best defended in France.|$|E
5|$|The album, Down the Road {{released}} in May 2002, received a good critical reception and {{proved to be}} his highest charting album in the US since 1972's Saint Dominic's Preview.

5|$|The infant Army Signal Corps, which <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> {{valuable}} {{part in the}} Civil War, had {{a need for a}} post-war training ground. In 1866, the Army allowed the Chief Signal Officer of the Army, General Albert J. Myer, to use Fort Greble for this purpose. Then, in 1868, Myer requested and received control over Fort Greble as a signal communications school for instruction in electric telegraphy and visual signaling. In January 1869, however, Myer moved the school from Fort Greble and soon established it at Fort Whipple, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The new prince's {{principal}} {{supporters were}} the noblemen {{who had been}} forced into exile in 1594, but they were impoverished young men, without influence. Instead of them, Andrew had to choose his officials from among the Roman Catholic lords: he made István Bodoni ispán (or head) of Kolozs County and Gáspár Sibrik {{the commander of the}} cavalry. Andrew was even unable to get rid of his opponents. For instance, Gáspár Kornis remained a member of the royal council, although he <b>had</b> <b>played</b> <b>a</b> preeminent role in the execution of Andrew's brother in 1594.|$|E

He suggests that anonymity might have been necessary to protect Bloxam's position at Rugby, but notes Rugby was quite progressive, which makes this unlikely; and, finally, suggests modesty as a possibility. Ian Ridpath, noting the plagiarism of the art from A Celestial Atlas, suggests that this alone might be sufficient to cause the author to wish to remain anonymous.|$|E
