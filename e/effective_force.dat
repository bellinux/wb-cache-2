5|$|One of {{the early}} results from the Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) was the {{discovery}} of excess infrared flux coming from Vega, beyond what would be expected from the star alone. This excess was measured at wavelengths of 25, 60, and 100μm, and came from within an angular radius of 10arcseconds (10″) centered on the star. At the measured distance of Vega, this corresponded to an actual radius of 80astronomical units (AU), where an AU is the average radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. It was proposed that this radiation came from a field of orbiting particles with a dimension {{on the order of}} a millimeter, as anything smaller would eventually be removed from the system by radiation pressure or drawn into the star by means of Poynting–Robertson drag. The latter is the result of radiation pressure creating an <b>effective</b> <b>force</b> that opposes the orbital motion of a dust particle, causing it to spiral inward. This effect is most pronounced for tiny particles that are closer to the star.|$|E

25|$|The Army of Tennessee {{was all but}} {{destroyed}} at Franklin. Nevertheless, {{rather than}} retreat and risk the army dissolving through desertions, Hood advanced his 26,500 man force against the Union army now combined under Thomas, firmly entrenched at Nashville which numbered more than 60,000. Hood and his department commander Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard requested reinforcements, but none were available. Strongly outnumbered and exposed to the elements, Hood was attacked by Thomas on December 15–16 at the Battle of Nashville, defeated decisively and pursued aggressively, retreating to Mississippi with just under 20,000 men. The Army of Tennessee never fought again as an <b>effective</b> <b>force</b> and Hood's career was ruined.|$|E

(2010) argued that the decadal scale adjustment clearly contains the oceanic changes, and hence, it is more appropriate to regard the adjustment {{as a part of the}} feedback, rather than as a part of the forcing.

25|$|Physics-based energy {{calculations}} aim {{to capture}} the interatomic interactions that are physically responsible for protein stability in solution, especially van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. These calculations are performed using a molecular mechanics force field; proteins are normally too large even for semi-empirical quantum mechanics-based calculations. The use of these methods {{is based on the}} energy landscape hypothesis of protein folding, which predicts that a protein's native state is also its energy minimum. Such methods usually employ implicit solvation, which provides a continuous approximation of a solvent bath for a single protein molecule without necessitating the explicit representation of individual solvent molecules. A force field specifically constructed for model assessment is known as the <b>Effective</b> <b>Force</b> Field (EFF) and is based on atomic parameters from CHARMM.|$|E

To the {{disappointment}} of PUK peshmerga intent on destroying Ansar al-Islam, the true mission of the CIA was to acquire intelligence about the Iraqi government and military. CIA-peshmerga operations eventually went beyond the scope of intelligence gathering however, as PUK peshmerga were used to destroy key rail lines and buildings prior to the U.S. attack in March 2003. Following Turkey's decision to deny any official use of its territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south.

25|$|Opponents to {{operating}} F-35s {{from the}} Canberra-class state that embarking enough aircraft {{to be an}} <b>effective</b> <b>force</b> would require abandoning their capability as amphibious warfare vessels, operating as an aircraft carrier would make the ships higher profile targets and need greater escorting forces, existing fuel and ordnance storage {{would not be able}} to sustain fixed-wing operations, structural modifications were needed to reinforce and heat-treat the flight deck to withstand F-35B vertical thrust, and the F-35B project itself has been the most expensive and most problematic of the three Joint Strike Fighter variants. Supporters counter that providing fixed-wing air support close to amphibious operations maximises aircraft capability, other nations are already working on solutions to structural and thrust problems for other Harrier-era ships, and the presence of a ski-jump makes the vessels already more suitable for STOVL operations than equivalent amphibious ships with flat flight decks.|$|E

25|$|In late January, discontented {{officers}} in Loring's Division {{wrote a letter}} of petition to the Confederate Secretary of War in Richmond, Virginia, resulting in an order from the Secretary to Jackson to withdraw Loring from Romney on grounds that his position was exposed to possible isolation by Federal forces.

Under pressure from his former commander General Joseph E. Johnston and from Governor Letcher, Jackson withdrew his resignation. The charges against Loring were dropped, however, and all non-Virginia forces, along with Loring, were reassigned out of the Valley District elsewhere, reducing Jackson's <b>effective</b> <b>force</b> to about 4,000 men.|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{trend in}} surface solar radiation (solar brightening) {{has been observed}} over Europe since the 1990 s, linked to economic developments and air pollution regulations and their direct as well as cloud-mediated effects on radiation. Here, {{we find that the}} all-sky solar brightening trend (1990 – 2005) over Europe from seven out of eight models (historical simulations in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) scales well with the regional and global mean <b>effective</b> <b>forcing</b> by anthropogenic aerosols (idealized “present-day” minus “preindustrial” runs). The reason for this relationship is that models that simulate stronger forcing efficiencies and stronger radiative effects by aerosol-cloud interactions show both a stronger aerosol forcing and a stronger solar brightening. The all-sky solar brightening is the observable from measurements (4. 06 ± 0. 60 Wm− 2 decade− 1), which then allows to infer a global mean total aerosol <b>effective</b> <b>forcing</b> at about − 1. 30 Wm− 2 with standard deviation ± 0. 40 Wm− 2...|$|R
25|$|Reynier's troops broke camp on {{the morning}} of 9 March. A wind at their backs blew snow in the eyes of their adversaries. The French general put one brigade in his front line, ordered his light {{infantry}} to turn the Neapolitan right flank, and placed Verdier in charge of the reserve. By 3:00 PM everything was ready. In single file, Reynier's light infantry picked their way along the cliffs on Damas' right flank and ultimately emerged to the right and rear of their opponents. Deploying into a cloud of skirmishers, they attacked, causing disorder in the Neapolitan lines. At the same time, General of Brigade Louis Fursy Henri Compère led a frontal assault on the first line. After exchanging a few volleys with their enemies, Compère's men charged forward and captured one of the redoubts. In the face of the double attack, the Neapolitan line crumpled and the men fled for the exit to the valley. Soon the pass was crammed with panicked soldiers and the French took 2,000 prisoners, including two generals. Total Neapolitan casualties added up to 3,000, and their artillery and baggage were also captured. French losses were unknown but light. The battle marked the end of the Neapolitan army as an <b>effective</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

In view of their inferior numbers and firepower, the Germans devised a plan to draw part of the British fleet into a trap and put it into effect at Jutland in , but the result was inconclusive.

40|$|Sensory {{mechanisms}} in biology, from cells to humans, have {{the property of}} adaptivity, whereby the response produced by the sensor is adapted to the overall amplitude of the signal; reducing the sensitivity {{in the presence of}} strong stimulus, while increasing it when it is weak. This property is inherently energy consuming and a manifestation of the non-equilibrium nature of living organisms. We explore here how adaptivity affects the <b>effective</b> <b>forces</b> that organisms feel due to others {{in the context of a}} uniform swarm, both in two and three dimensions. The interactions between the individuals are taken to be attractive and long-range, of power-law form. We find that the effects of adaptivity inside the swarm are dramatic, where the <b>effective</b> <b>forces</b> decrease (or remain constant) with increasing swarm density. Linear stability analysis demonstrates how this property prevents collapse (Jeans instability), when the forces are adaptive. Adaptivity therefore endows swarms with a natural mechanism for self-stabilization. Comment: 11 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the realm}} of {{classical}} electrodynamics, the curvature-induced bunch collective interaction in magnetic bends can be studied using <b>effective</b> <b>forces</b> in the canonical formulation of the coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) effect. As an application of this canonical formulation, in this paper, for an electron distribution moving ultrarelativistically in a bending system, {{the dynamics of the}} particles in the distribution is derived from the Hamiltonian of the particles in terms of the bunch internal coordinates. The consequent Vlasov equation manifests explicitly how the phase-space distribution is perturbed by the <b>effective</b> CSR <b>forces.</b> In particular, we study the impact of an initial linear energy chirp of the bunch on the behavior of the <b>effective</b> longitudinal CSR <b>force,</b> which arises due to the modification of the retardation relation {{as a result of the}} energy-chirping-induced longitudinal-horizontal correlation of the bunch distribution (bunch tilt) in dispersive regions. Our study clearly demonstrates the time delay (or retardation) of the behavior of the <b>effective</b> longitudinal CSR <b>force</b> on a bunch in responding to the change of the bunch length in a magnetic bend. Our result also shows that the <b>effective</b> longitudinal CSR <b>force</b> for a bunch under full compression can have sensitive dependence on the transverse position of the test particle in the bunch for certain parameter regimes...|$|R
