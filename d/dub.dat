5|$|At {{the end of}} 2003, running {{independently}} {{from the}} pioneering FWD night, an event called Filthy <b>Dub,</b> co promoted by Plastician, and partner David Carlisle started happening regularly. It was there that Skream, Benga, NType, Walsh, Chef, Loefah, and Cyrus made their debuts as DJs. South London collective Digital Mystikz (Mala and Coki), along with labelmates and collaborators Loefah and MC Sgt Pokes soon came into their own, bringing sound system thinking, <b>dub</b> values, and appreciation of jungle bass weight to the dubstep scene. Digital Mystikz brought an expanded palette of sounds and influences to the genre, most prominently reggae and <b>dub,</b> as well as orchestral melodies.|$|E

40|$|This thesis compares and {{contrasts}} <b>dubbing</b> in {{the four}} biggest European <b>dubbing</b> countries (France, Italy, Germany and Spain - FIGS) and <b>dubbing</b> in the Netherlands, which is a subtitling country. The central question in the thesis is how the position of <b>dubbing</b> in a country, i. e. whether it {{is or is not}} the dominant mode of audiovisual translation, affects working conditions and quality in <b>dubbing.</b> Viewers who grow up with <b>dubbing</b> become so habituated to it that they fail to see or ignore its shortcomings, including flaws in dubbings that could have been prevented. Because of this uncritical audience, clients of <b>dubbing</b> studios in the FIGS are able to impose low budgets and tight deadlines on <b>dubbing</b> studios, which cause less-than-ideal working conditions and poorer quality. One might expect the Dutch audience to be more critical, but the Dutch audience of <b>dubbing</b> mostly consists of children who are not very critical of <b>dubbing</b> at all either. Thus, {{it is no wonder that}} the Dutch <b>dubbing</b> industry also struggles with low budgets and tight deadlines...|$|R
5|$|In {{producing}} the English <b>dub</b> {{version of the}} series, Media Blasters chose Lex Lang as Sanosuke's voice actor. When writing Sanosuke's dialogue, Clark Cheng, the writer of the English <b>dub</b> script, noted that the character was smarter {{than he would have}} liked in the first few episodes, so Cheng tried slowly to change the character's dialogue to make Sanosuke seem less intelligent so he would be more similar to the equivalent in the Japanese version of the series.|$|E

5|$|To {{prevent any}} similar {{incidents}} from reoccurring, Nintendo quickly ordered the episode pulled, {{and it has}} not aired since, not even outside Japan. Maddie Blaustein, the English <b>dub</b> voice of Meowth, said twice on the Serebii.net forums that this episode was dubbed in the United States by 4Kids Entertainment. On the other hand, Veronica Taylor, the English voice of Ash, claimed that this episode was never dubbed and will not be dubbed, though this was contradicted again on September 25, 2016, when Eric Stuart, the English <b>dub</b> voice of Brock and James, said that 4Kids did indeed <b>dub</b> the episode. Regardless, any plans to release this episode outside Japan were abandoned after Nintendo objected, and it was never broadcast anywhere else in the world. Coincidentally, the episode aired around the same time Pokémon was being adapted for American audiences. 4Kids Entertainment's <b>dub</b> took extra precaution in bright and flashing lights in the show, using the post-1997 versions altering lighting and the frequency of flashing lights for earlier episodes of their American release.|$|E
