30|$|The {{scale for}} product {{uniqueness}} {{was drawn from}} Aspelund and Moen’s (2005). Statements included “Our products are unique in terms of designs and features,” “Our products are innovative and creative to meet consumer demands,” “Our products meet demands for special target segments,” and “Our customers visit our store to buy unique and specialized products”. These items were measured on a 7 -point Likert-type scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (7); higher scores indicate {{a higher level of}} product uniqueness relative to their major three competitors. The domestic growth opportunity scale, drawn from Burke (1984), measured market attractiveness. The Burke (1984) scale was modified in order to better capture the domestic market prospects specific to a retail industry. Five items were measured on a 7 -point <b>interval</b> scale <b>anchored</b> by “very low” (1) and “very high” (7). Respondents were asked to indicate how they perceive the growth opportunities of their target market in the US domestic market considering future competition, short-term (3 -year) market growth rate, long-term (10 -year) market growth rate, future profits, and “room” for growth in the domestic market in terms of retail sales and market share. Burke’s (1984) scale has a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.92.|$|R

40|$|Breeding for solid-stemmed durum (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) {{and common}} wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars is one {{strategy}} to minimize yield losses {{caused by the}} wheat stem sawfly (Cephus cinctus Norton). Major stem-solidness QTL have been localized to the long arm of chromosome 3 B in both wheat species, but it is unclear if these QTL span a common genetic interval. In this study, we have improved {{the resolution of the}} QTL on chromosome 3 B in a durum (Kofa/W 9262 - 260 D 3) and common wheat (Lillian/Vesper) mapping population. Coincident QTL (LOD = 94 - 127, R 2 = 78 - 92 %) were localized near the telomere of chromosome 3 BL in both mapping populations, which we designate SSt 1. We further examined the SSt 1 interval by using available consensus maps for durum and common wheat and compared genetic to physical <b>intervals</b> by <b>anchoring</b> markers to the current version of the wild emmer wheat (WEW) reference sequence. These results suggest that the SSt 1 interval spans a physical distance of 1. 6 Mb in WEW (positions 833. 4 - 835. 0 Mb). In addition, minor QTL were identified on chromosomes 2 A, 2 D, 4 A, and 5 A that were found to synergistically enhance expression of SSt 1 to increase stem-solidness. These results suggest that developing new wheat cultivars with improved stem-solidness is possible by combining SSt 1 with favorable alleles at minor loci within both wheat species...|$|R
40|$|When {{calibrating}} spatial partial equilibrium {{models with}} conjectural variations, some modelers fit the suppliers' {{sales to the}} available data in addition to total consumption and price levels. While this certainly enhances {{the quality of the}} calibration, it makes it difficult to accommodate user-imposed bounds on the model parameters such as restricting the market power parameters to the interval [0, 1], which is a common requirement in conjectural variations approaches. We propose an algorithm to calibrate the suppliers' sales and simultaneously deal with user-defined bounds on parameters. To this end, we fix the suppliers' sales at reference values and obtain the marginal costs for each supplier and market. We then limit the market power parameters to the interval [0, 1], and calculate <b>intervals</b> of <b>anchor</b> prices and price elasticities that reproduce the reference supplier sales in the state of equilibrium. If these intervals do not contain the reference price elasticities and prices, we face a mismatch between reality and the model mechanics. We resolve this by altering the reference sales for the critical suppliers, and iterate. Thereby, the user controls whether price elasticities and anchor prices should be close to their reference values, or the suppliers' sales. The algorithm is tested on data from the European gas market, and required less than one minute to identify calibrated parameters. Our algorithm is widely applicable, since it is based on mild (and common) underlying assumptions and can be configured to suit a specific purpose thanks to the inclusion of user-defined bounds on all relevant parameters...|$|R

For GAF with more than two scales there is limited empirical testing, but what is gained or lost by using more than two scales? Conclusions In the history of GAF, its basic properties have undergone limited changes.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that timing processes in the suprasecond scale are modulated by attentional mechanisms; in addition, some {{studies have shown that}} attentional mechanisms also affect timing in the subsecond scale. Our aim was to study eye movements and pupil diameter during a temporal bisection task in the subsecond range. Subjects were trained to discriminate <b>anchor</b> <b>intervals</b> of 200 or 800 msec, and were then confronted with intermediate durations. Eye movements revealed that subjects used different cognitive strategies during the bisection timing task. When the stimulus to be timed appeared randomly at a central or 4 peripheral positions on a screen, some subjects choose to maintain their gaze toward the central area while other followed the peripheral placement of the stimulus; some others subjects used both strategies. The time of subjective equality did not differ between subjects who employed different attentional mechanisms. However, differences emerged in the timing variance and attentional indexes (time taken to initial fixation, latency to respond, pupil dilatation and duration and number of fixations to stimulus areas). Timing in the subsecond range seems invariant despite the use of different attentional strategies. Future research should determine whether the selection of attentional mechanisms is related to particular timing tasks or instructions or whether it represents idiosyncratic cognitive "styles"...|$|R
40|$|Unreinforced masonry (URM) {{structures}} {{have historically}} been regarded as structurally unsound in response to seismic events. The tendency for URM walls to collapse out-of-plane in a brittle manner is continually cause for concern. Retrofit of these walls is {{necessary in order to}} prevent severe damage and injury to occupants. This paper is concerned with the retrofit of unreinforced masonry (URM) walls in response to out-of-plane loading. A retrofit design was developed and verified through structural testing. The selected retrofit technique incorporates vertical coring of URM walls to allow for the insertion of a single post-tensioning (PT) tendon. Tendons are spaced at a regular <b>interval</b> and <b>anchored</b> {{at the top of the}} wall parapet and at the lower diaphragm level. Tensioning of the tendons imparts a compressive stress to the wall that effectively increases the wall cracking moment strength, ultimate moment strength and displacement capacity. Additionally, the insertion of PT tendons allows the wall to behave in a ductile manner in response to out-of-plane ground motion. Extensive research was conducted in order to accurately portray the material properties and construction methods of unreinforced masonry walls in San Luis Obispo, California. Various mortar mix designs were generated and tested so that a mix design could be selected to best reflect the target URM structures. Seismic parameters were generated to reflect a URM structure in San Luis Obispo. An unreinforced masonry wall was constructed by a professional mason using the established mortar mix proportions and salvaged bricks from the 1920 era. Having a pin-pin unsupported height of 11 feet, the wall constructed for testing was reflective of the configuration of URM walls in many downtown San Luis Obispo structures. The wall was loaded in the out-of-plane direction by 4 equal point loads mimicking a uniformly distributed load. The testing program consisted of cycling the wall through target internal moments and target displacements. It was verified through testing that post-tensioning tendons can be successfully introduced in URM walls to resist out-of-plane bending. Testing showed that the addition of PT tendons significantly increased the wall’s cracking moment capacity, giving it the elastic strength to resist twice the forces imposed by the design-level ground motion. PT tendons also increased the nominal strength of the wall, allowing the wall to achieve large displacements without collapse. It was also found that PT tendons provided a restoring force to the wall returning it to almost no residual displacement after each displacement cycle. Thus, the URM wall retrofitted with PT tendons demonstrated significant integrity as a structural system, providing for improved strength and ductility with no residual displacement...|$|R
40|$|Background: Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are {{ubiquitous}} in all living organism. They implement {{the genetic code}} so that most genomes contain distinct tRNAs for almost all 61 codons. They behave similar to mobile elements and proliferate in genomes spawning both local and non-local copies. Most tRNA families are therefore typically present as multicopy genes. The members of the individual tRNA families evolve under concerted or rapid birth-death evolution, so that paralogous copies maintain almost identical sequences over long evolutionary time-scales. To a good approximation these are functionally equivalent. Individual tRNA copies thus are evolutionary unstable and easily turn into pseudogenes and disappear. This leads to a rapid turnover of tRNAs and often large differences in the tRNA complements of closely related species. Since tRNA paralogs are not distinguished by sequence, common methods cannot {{not be used to}} establish orthology between tRNA genes. Results: In this contribution we introduce a general framework to distinguish orthologs and paralogs in gene families that are subject to concerted evolution. It is based on the use of uniquely aligned adjacent sequence elements as anchors to establish syntenic conservation of sequence <b>intervals.</b> In practice, <b>anchors</b> and <b>intervals</b> can be extracted from genome-wide multiple sequence alignments. Syntenic clusters of concertedly evolving genes of different families can then be subdivided by list alignments, leading to usually small clusters of candidate co-orthologs. On the basis of recent advances in phylogenetic combinatorics, these candidate clusters can be further processed by cograph editing to recover their duplication histories. We developed a workflow that can be conceptualized as stepwise refinement of a graph of homologous genes. We apply this analysis strategy with different types of synteny anchors to investigate the evolution of tRNAs in primates and fruit flies. We identified a large number of tRNA remolding events concentrated at the tips of the phylogeny. With one notable exception all phylogenetically old tRNA remoldings do not change the isoacceptor class. Conclusions: Gene families evolving under concerted evolution are not amenable to classical phylogenetic analyses since paralogs maintain identical, species-specific sequences, precluding the estimation of correct gene trees from sequence differences. This leaves conservation of syntenic arrangements with respect to "anchor elements" that are not subject to concerted evolution as the only viable source of phylogenetic information. We have demonstrated here that a purely synteny-based analysis of tRNA gene histories is indeed feasible. Although the choice of synteny anchors influences the resolution in particular when tight gene clusters are present, and the quality of sequence alignments, genome assemblies, and genome rearrangements limits the scope of the analysis, largely coherent results can be obtained for tRNAs. In particular, we conclude that a large fraction of the tRNAs are recent copies. This proliferation is compensated by rapid pseudogenization as exemplified by many very recent alloacceptor remoldings...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} on the {{influence}} of comprehensive servicescape on shopping behaviour of road and rail travelling shoppers. The comprehensive servicescape is referred to as synchronization of the multidimensional servicescape dimensions, which are the physical environment, social environment, socially symbolic and the natural dimensions into one entity that the travellers encounter during the shopping exercise. The servicescape cues that include shoppers and the physical set-up of the service firm are important in influencing service quality evaluation and consumer satisfaction. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the impact of servicescape on travelling shoppers’ buying behaviour and shopping motivations amongst different shoppers that were identified within the South African bus and railway stations. The bus and railway station environment induces an interesting type of shopping behaviour amongst the travelers. The purpose of the study was also to explore the travelling shoppers’ expectations and perceptions on the comprehensive servicescape within the bus station’s retail environment. Additionally the study attempted to address important gaps in the South African literature in respect of the influence of socialservicescape on the buyer behaviour and hedonic motivation of travelling shopper. The questionnaires used in the study were constructed along five dimensions of service quality containing statements linked to a five-point Likert-type <b>interval</b> scale <b>anchored</b> by “strongly agree” and “strongly disagree. Self administered questionnaires were used for data collection from the travelling shoppers through “mall intercept technique” and 300 questionnaires were collected from respondents. The academia benefits from this study from the comprehensive servicescape model of the South African bus and railway stations that was developed. The study built on literature by investigating the influence of the comprehensive servicescapes as perceived by travelling shoppers within the South African retail environment. Additionally it was shown both theoretically and empirically, that, that service quality in high contact service environment like the bus and railway station can best be explained by an analysis of the comprehensive servicescape or the multidimensional and hierarchical model. As a result of this study retailers will have a full picture on the specific needs, perception and expectations of road and rail travellers in relation to the quality of the stations’ servicescape, which retailers have to improve in order to increase customer patronage. It is assumed that retailers will be aware that store image and the store ambience should meet the challenges of the perceptions, motivations and consumer behaviour of travellers within the comprehensive servicescape of the station. This study provides a trigger effect to spatial planners to design high quality servicescape that will attract travellers for both hedonic and utilitarian shopping. Hirschman and Holbrook (1982) believed that shoppers derive pleasure from the experience of shopping itself, regardless of the joy from acquiring goods, this more so with travelling shoppers. A bus station can be both a growth node and a tourist attraction, if its features are attractive, therefore planners can benefit from this study. In this study theory that forms the bases of the influence of social servicescape on the behaviour of travelling shoppers that frequently visit and participate in shopping at various South African bus station retail outlets is provided. Additionally, this study provided empirical information on the relationships that exist amongst the characteristics of the South African Park Stations’ physical retail environments, user perceptions and interpersonal encounters. The behaviour of shopping travellers was extensively discussed to provide the background of theories and various models concerning shopping behaviour of travellers. Through this work, clarity on consumer behavioural trends of travelling shoppers in the South African retail sector is provided, which assist in differentiating retail products, services and segmentation of markets in a way that could enhance marketing effectiveness amongst the travelling shopping segment. Special attention was paid to factors that motivate road travellers’ choice of stores; the type of products they purchase and their decision making processes. Effort were made to identify, categorize and segment shopper typologies and their shopping behaviours. Effort was also made to discuss extensively the social and physical influences of environments in a retail environment such as that of the bus and railway station. The discussions in this study focussed on describing the comprehensive servicescape model dimensions which shoppers encountered during their shopping activity. The study also indicated the significance of the interaction of service staff with the customers in determining the service quality, customer satisfaction and the future intention of travelers. Additionally this study emphasised the importance of social encounters and perceptiveness to cues within the station, which determine whether they actively or passively are involved in the shopping encounter. The research findings reveal that, travellers perceive the servicescape within the bus station as unattractive and lack appropriate facilities. Furthermore travelers considered the two dimensions (store image and store ambience) of the store’s servicescape as one composite unit of the servicescape. This position is supported in literature, where it is argued that people respond to their environment holistically, rather than to individual stimuli. The travelling shoppers reveal that although they always find the shops from the bus station clean and neat, consumers expect a certain level of ambient environmental conditions to be present. The empirical findings in this study indicate that travelling shoppers are not interested in visiting the stores at the bus and railway station for shopping because merchandise from the bus station stores is poor in quality and unreliable; the surroundings at the station as unpleasant and the bus and railway station stores are congested. Thus, hasty shopping and spending more time or stay longer than planned for shopping at the bus and railway station is not useful to travelling shoppers. Therefore, travellers feel strongly that the shopping environment of the station is not conducive to shopping. These facilities (stations) are only used for travelling purposes; therefore there is a need for improvement in the retail and station facilities in order to increase shopping activities within this servicescape. The research findings reveal that shopping at the bus station seems to be driven by traditional needs such as functional and experiential motivations as well as travelrelated needs such as busstation-atmosphere-related and bus station-infrastructurerelated motivations. It was difficult to deduce a particular typology of shoppers in this environment, but due to the stress related to travelling. Passive shopping was observed amongst travellers, which is not a positive shopping behaviour for retailer...|$|R
