40|$|Water <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> {{capacitive}} deionization (CDI) {{is performed}} via electrochemical cells {{consisting of two}} porous carbon electrodes. Upon transferring charge from one electrode to the other, ions are removed from the feedwater by electrosorption into electrical double layers (EDLs) within the micropores of the porous carbon. When using electrodes containing fixed chemical charge in the micropores, various counterintuitive observations have been made, such as "inverted CDI" where upon charging, ions are released from the electrode, and the feedwater is only desalinated when the cell is discharging. We set up an EDL model including chemical charge that explains these observations and makes predictions for a working range of enhanced <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> CDI...|$|R

40|$|Through {{bio-inspired}} polydopamine modificatiorrof {{the ceramic}} support surface, dense and reproducible zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) membranes {{have been developed}} for the first time for seawater <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> pervaporation. Demonstrated by both experimental and simulation studies, the developed ZIF membranes show high desalination performances attributing to the small pore size of the ZIF membranes, which is exactly in between the size of water molecules and hydrated ions. The ZIF membranes show a high stability in seawater. At 25, 50, 75 and 100 degrees C, the water fluxes through the ZIF- 8 membrane are 5. 8, 8. 1, 10. 8, and 13. 5 kg/(m(2). h), respectively, with a high ion rejection of over 99. 8 %, which is promising for seawater <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> ionic sieving.

40|$|Although {{industrial}} osmotic {{processes are}} {{often referred to}} as ‘novel’, the possibility for osmotic power generation has been suggested as early as the 1970 s. Today forward osmosis is attracting significant interest and this interest has resulted in intensive research. Forward osmosis has been suggested as viable separation process, with numerous potential applications – from osmotic drug delivery and concentration of liquid foods to water purification and re-use in space. Particularly interesting is the possibility of seawater <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> forward osmosis, as the process is claimed to require little or no pre-treatment of the feed water, due to minor membrane fouling. This alone is a significant advantage over reverse osmosis. Within the oil and gas sector, research conducted {{in the last couple of}} years shows that low salinity waterflooding can result in enhanced oil recovery, and therefore the industry is searching for new possibilities for off-shore based production of low salinity water. Due to the fact that forward osmosis operates at atmospheric pressure and requires no pressure vessels, the process can be utilized for seawater desalination where low overall equipment weight is required – off-shore oil platforms for example. This thesis is focused on the development of membranes for water <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> forward osmosis, and estimation of the requirements (approximate membrane area and volume) for seawater <b>desalination</b> <b>by</b> a two-stage membrane based forward osmosis – nanofiltration process.
