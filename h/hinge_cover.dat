50|$|Many of the weapon's parts, {{including}} the frame, pistol grip/charging handle, trigger, sear, and disconnector {{are made of}} plastic, while many other parts are made of stainless steel; altogether, it has only 39 individual components. The receiver is made from stamped sheet steel with a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{tube sheet}} {{at each end}} with tube ends rolled, for {{each end of the}} {{condenser}} is closed by a fabricated box cover known as a waterbox, with flanged connection to the tube sheet or condenser shell. The waterbox is usually provided with man holes on <b>hinged</b> <b>covers</b> to allow inspection and cleaning.|$|R
50|$|A silent butler, {{sometimes}} called an ash butler, {{is a small}} container, often of base metal, sometimes silver or silverplate, with a handle and <b>hinged</b> <b>cover,</b> used for collecting ashes or crumbs. They were more common prior to the modern period, and enjoyed some popularity being made as a home construction project in the US. They are now often considered collector's items, or are valued for their retro appeal.|$|R
50|$|Flatbed {{scanners}} {{typically have}} a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> {{that covers the}} bed, and reflects light back into the scan head. This cover is usually removed or propped open when scanning 3-D objects, to prevent damage or compression of the subject. Removal of the cover also allows the artist to use additional light sources positioned above the bed, {{which can be used}} to enhance the depth captured by the scanner.|$|R
50|$|When a bus, {{truck or}} tractor or {{excavator}} has a vertical exhaust pipe (called stacks or pipes behind the cab), sometimes {{the end is}} curved, or has a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> flap which the gas flow blows out of the way, {{to try to prevent}} foreign objects (including droppings from a bird perching on the exhaust pipe when the vehicle is not being used) getting inside the exhaust pipe.|$|R
5000|$|It commemorates Abastumani in Caucasus where Grand Duke George {{spent most}} of his life after being {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis. Miniatures were done and signed by Krijitski. The miniatures are revealed by opening four pearl-bordered doors around the egg. Each door bears a diamond-set numeral of the year, forming the year 1893. Behind the <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> at the top is a portrait of the Grand Duke in his naval uniform.|$|R
5000|$|Manual {{scrubbing}} {{requires the}} bulk tank to have large <b>hinged</b> <b>covers</b> {{that can be}} lifted open to permit {{easy access to the}} interior surfaces of the tank. It tends to be much more thorough than automatic methods since it permits the tank to be carefully inspected during the washing process. If the tank is not found to be cleaned well enough, a troublesome area can be given additional cleansing attention.|$|R
50|$|Trunks and chests are {{sometimes}} constructed of tinplate. These large boxes {{often have a}} <b>hinged</b> top <b>cover</b> and {{are sometimes}} highly decorated.|$|R
50|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} Krag-Jørgensen action was its magazine. While many other rifles of its era used an integral box magazine loaded by a charger or stripper clip, the magazine of the Krag-Jørgensen was integral with the receiver (the part of the rifle that houses the operating parts), featuring an opening on the right hand side with a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover.</b> Instead of a charger, single cartridges were inserted through the side opening, and were pushed up, around, and into the action by a spring follower.|$|R
50|$|The Russian IDA71 {{military}} and naval rebreather is an oxygen rebreather {{intended for use}} by naval and military divers. As supplied {{it is in a}} plain backpack harness with no buoyancy aid. The casing is pressed aluminium with a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover.</b> It has a small optional nitrox cylinder which can be clipped on its outside to convert it to nitrox mode. It contains one oxygen cylinder and two absorbent canisters. In the bottom of its casing is an empty space which is intended for an underwater communications set.|$|R
50|$|Aided by a {{substantial}} subsidy, {{he won a}} state government contract for £180,000 worth of cast-iron water and drainage pipes in 1884, enabling him {{to set up a}} factory in Kilkenny, for which purpose he travelled to Great Britain, ordering heavy machinery and engaging fifteen specialist workers. With characteristic energy, Fulton soon had production under way, to the discomfort of nearby residents. With New South Wales A. R. Lungley he took out patents for a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> in May 1885, for a method of disconnecting water mains in December 1888, and for a method of supplying fuel to smelting furnaces in September 1889.|$|R
50|$|The XV-5 was {{powered by}} two 2,658 lbf kN thrust General Electric J85-GE-5 turbojets. General Electric X353-5 Lift-fans {{in the wings}} and a smaller fan in the nose, powered by engine exhaust gas, were used for Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL). The 62.5 in {{diameter}} lift fan in each wing had a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> on the upper wing surface which was opened for VTOL. The 36 in nose fan provided adequate pitch control but produced adverse handling characteristics. The fans provided vertical lift of approximately 16,000 lbf kN, nearly three times {{the thrust of the}} engines as turbojets.|$|R
50|$|The hood (American English) or bonnet (British English) is the <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> {{over the}} engine of motor {{vehicles}} that allows access to the engine compartment (or trunk on rear-engine and some mid-engine vehicles) for maintenance and repair. In British terminology, hood refers to a fabric cover over the passenger compartment of the car (known as the 'top' in the US). In many motor vehicles built in the 1930s and 1940s, the resemblance to an actual hood or bonnet is clear when open and viewed head-on; in modern vehicles it continues to serve the same purpose but no longer resembles a head covering.|$|R
5000|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, the PowerBook 5300 series has been viewed as a disappointment. Problems with cracked cases and {{overheating}} batteries prompted several recalls, while some users were simply unimpressed with the specifications of the machine and its lackluster performance. Some systems, after heavy use, would develop hinge problems; cracking of the <b>hinge</b> <b>covers,</b> as well as internal ribbon cables wearing/tearing and causing the display to show vertical lines and occasionally black out completely. This problem existed on earlier Powerbook models as well, most notably the Powerbook 500 series (including 520, 540c and the black-cased, higher-spec Japan-only 550c) ...|$|R
2500|$|Swords, the Greek {{helmet and}} often body armour {{such as the}} muscle cuirass were made of bronze, {{sometimes}} decorated in precious metal, as in the 3rd-century Ksour Essef cuirass. [...] Armour and [...] "shield-bands" [...] {{are two of the}} contexts for strips of Archaic low relief scenes, which were also attached to various objects in wood; the band on the Vix Krater is a large example. [...] Polished bronze mirrors, initially with decorated backs and kore handles, were another common item; the later [...] "folding mirror" [...] type had <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> pieces, often decorated with a relief scene, typically erotic. Coins are described below.|$|R
50|$|Boards may be elaborately carved {{or simple}} and functional; {{they may include}} a pedestal, or be hinged to fold {{lengthwise}} or crosswise and latch for portability and storage with the seeds inside. While most commonly located at either end, scoring houses may be placed elsewhere, and the rows need not be straight. When a board has a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> like a diptych, the scoring houses may be carved into {{the two halves of}} the cover, and so be in front of the players during play. The ground may also be used as a board; players simply scoop two rows of pits out of the earth.|$|R
50|$|Manual call {{points are}} used to {{initiate}} an alarm signal, and operate {{by means of a}} simple button press. They can form part of a manual alarm system or an automatic alarm system. There will be an indicator on the monitoring unit for visual indication to locate the call point easily, and there should be a visual identifier of the unit which triggered the alarm, typically a mechanical flag which operates on a latch and must be manually reset, e.g. by a key.Previously, the old British standard did not allow <b>hinged</b> <b>covers</b> and plastic resettable elements. Plastic elements must have the same printing as the EN 54 glass.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{daguerreotype}} {{itself is}} {{on a relatively}} thin sheet of soft metal, it was easily sheared down to sizes and shapes suited for mounting into lockets, as was done with miniature paintings. Other imaginative uses of daguerreotype portraits were to mount them in watch fobs and watch cases, jewel caskets and other ornate silver or gold boxes, the handles of walking sticks, and in brooches, bracelets and other jewelry now referred to by collectors as [...] "daguerreian jewelry". The cover glass or crystal was sealed either directly {{to the edges of}} the daguerreotype or to the opening of its receptacle and a protective <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> was usually provided.|$|R
5000|$|The iBook {{had three}} {{different}} designs during its lifetime. The first, {{known as the}} [...] "Clamshell," [...] {{was inspired by the}} design of Apple's popular iMac line at the time. It was a significant departure from previous portable computer designs due to its shape, bright colors, incorporation of a handle into the casing, lack of a display closing latch, lack of a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> over the external ports and built-in wireless networking. Two years later, the second generation abandoned the original form factor in favor of a more conventional, rectangular design. In October 2003, a third iteration was released that added a PowerPC G4 chip and a slot-loading drive.|$|R

40|$|Description of {{the optical}} and {{structural}} design requirements, mechanical and thermal response analyses, final design features, and testing procedures {{employed in the}} development of a large window mounted on the earth-facing side of the multiple docking adapter (MDA) of the Skylab manned space vehicle. This window was designed for the S 190 earth resources multispectral camera and was protected from the space environment during nonuse periods by a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> operated from within the MDA. The camera required a viewing area approximately 43 by 58 cm. A single glass pane 4. 1 cm thick was selected to minimize optical distortions. Heaters on the glass and frame were designed to control distortions caused by thermal gradients in the glass...|$|R
25|$|The {{retracting}} pawl notch was removed, and {{a clearance}} slot for the <b>cover</b> <b>hinge</b> rivets was added.|$|R
50|$|The gun was {{designed}} with a 280 mm long barrel which featured a compensator and cooling fins. Empty casings are ejected {{out of the}} ejection port on the right, which has a <b>hinged</b> dust <b>cover.</b> This cover opens automatically when cocking the gun.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} round, the player chooses six cases to {{eliminate}} from play, {{one at a}} time. Each case is opened as it is chosen, and the amount inside {{is removed from the}} board. After the sixth pick, a cordless telephone on the podium rings and the host answers it to speak with [...] "The Banker" [...] - a male figure, visible only as a dimly lit silhouette, who sits in a skybox overlooking the studio. The Banker's face is never seen, and his voice is never heard; after the call ends, the host relays the Banker's offer to buy the player's case. The player can accept the offer and end the game by saying [...] "deal" [...] and pressing a red button on the podium, or reject it by saying [...] "no deal" [...] and closing a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> over the button.|$|R

40|$|Photograph of the {{interior}} view of Mission San Juan Capistrano, showing the baptismal font and the burial place of Sargent Don Jose Antonio Yorba I, Orange County, ca. 1885. The font, made of stone(?), has a <b>hinged</b> <b>cover</b> where the open half section of the cover is laying {{on top of the}} other half. Three statues stand along the wall next to the font. Two of the statues show women looking at the font. The third statue is missing a head and the hand on the extended arm is broken off. Cracks and stains can be seen on the walls. The wooden shutter on the window of the right wall is open allowing sunlight to shine through. "Below and slightly in front of the font is the burial place of Sargent Don Jose Antonio Yorba I. " Picture file card reads: "Father Serra's 1777 church"...|$|R
50|$|Recently, a newly {{configured}} {{version of}} the Saiga 12 was introduced. Called the Saiga Taktika mod 040, it features an extended magazine well, last round bolt hold open (recently produced very rarely and replaced with manual bolt hold), <b>hinged</b> dust <b>cover</b> with Picatinny rail for mounting optics, picatinny rail gas block, and a newly designed 8-round magazine (not interchangeable with other Saiga-12 models).|$|R
