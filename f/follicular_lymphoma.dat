25|$|In January 2013 it was {{revealed}} {{in an interview in}} Fædrelandsvennen that Schuff had been diagnosed with <b>Follicular</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in the Fall of 2012, a form of cancer which, while indolent, is generally considered medically incurable after Stage I.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{clinical}} trials {{are already in}} the pipeline or being conducted to explore further use for lenalidomide, alone or in combination with other drugs. Some of these indications include acute myeloid leukemia, <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> MALT lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, lupus erythematosus, Hodgkin's lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome and more.|$|E
40|$|Follicular {{dendritic}} cells (FDC) show homo- and heterocellular metabolic coupling through connexin 43 (Cx 43) gap junctions {{and support}} B cell selection and maturation in germinal centers. In <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> B cells escape apoptosis while FDC develop abnormally. Here we tested Cx 43 channels in reactive FDC development and <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> In culture, {{the treatment of}} FDC-B cell clusters (resembling to “ex vivo” germinal centers) with Gap 27 peptide, mimicking the 2 nd extracellular loop of Cx 43 protein, significantly impaired FDC-B cell cluster formation and cell survival. In untreated cultures of intact clusters, cell proliferation showed a moderate reduction. In tissues, Cx 43 protein levels run parallel with the density of FDC both in reactive germinal centers and in malformed follicles of <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and showed strong upregulation in newly generated and/or degrading bi-/multinuclear FDC of rudimentary processes. However, the inverse correlation between Cx 43 expression and B cell proliferation seen in reactive germinal centers was not detected in <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> Furthermore, Cx 43 levels were not associated with either lymphoma grade or bone marrow involvement. Our results suggest that Cx 43 channels are critical in FDC and “ex vivo” germinal center development and in the persistence of FDC in <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> but do not affect tumor progression...|$|R
50|$|Of all cancers {{involving}} {{the same class}} of blood cell (lymphoproliferative disorders), 22% of cases are <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas.</b>|$|R
40|$|Immunohistochemical and {{molecular}} genetic studies {{were performed on}} tissues involved by <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> {{that at some point}} in their course showed a lack of detectable surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulins (Ig). The variable nature of Ig expression in these lymphomas was evidenced by three tumors biopsied from two different sites that showed an Ig-negative phenotype in one biopsy versus an Ig-positive phenotype in the other. The B lineage derivation of Ig-negative <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> was confirmed by the presence of Ig heavy and light chain gene rearrangements in eight of eight lymphomas tested. In a way similar to Ig-expressing <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> the Ig-negative tumors were characterized by bcl- 2 gene rearrangements (seven of eight) and overexpression of the Bcl- 2 protein (eight out of nine). In two of the three lymphomas with Ig-positive and Ig-negative tumor cell populations, the clonal relationship of the Ig-expressing and nonexpressing cells was established by demonstration of identical t(14; 18) DNA rearrangements. The findings demonstrated that the variability of Ig expression in <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> reflects the phenotypic heterogeneity of these tumors and is not a manifestation of separate clonal origins...|$|R
25|$|The first {{insight into}} the {{mechanism}} came from studying BCL2, {{the product of a}} putative oncogene activated by chromosome translocations often found in <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> Unlike other cancer genes, which promote cancer by stimulating cell proliferation, BCL2 promoted cancer by stopping lymphoma cells from being able to kill themselves.|$|E
25|$|Many low-grade lymphomas remain {{indolent}} {{for many}} years. Treatment of the nonsymptomatic patient is often avoided. In {{these forms of}} lymphoma, such as <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> watchful waiting is often the initial course of action. This is carried out because the harms and risks of treatment outweigh the benefits. If a low-grade lymphoma is becoming symptomatic, radiotherapy or chemotherapy are the treatments of choice; although they do not cure the lymphoma, they can alleviate the symptoms, particularly painful lymphadenopathy. Patients with these types of lymphoma can live near-normal lifespans, but the disease is incurable. Some centers advocate the use of single agent rituximab {{in the treatment of}} <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphoma</b> rather than the wait and watch approach. Watchful waiting is not a good strategy for all patients, as it leads to significant distress and anxiety in some patients. It has been equated with watch and worry.|$|E
25|$|Interleukin-2 and interferon-α are cytokines, {{proteins}} that regulate and coordinate the behaviour {{of the immune}} system. They {{have the ability to}} enhance anti-tumor activity and thus can be used as passive cancer treatments. Interferon-α is used in the treatment of hairy-cell leukaemia, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> chronic myeloid leukaemia and malignant melanoma. Interleukin-2 is used in the treatment of malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} 17 {{cases of}} <b>follicular</b> large cell <b>lymphoma</b> using monoclonal antibodies applied to frozen sections. The neoplastic cells in 11 cases (65 %) showed evidence of immunoglobulin expression {{similar to the}} reported percentage of immunoglobulin expressing diffuse large cell lymphomas and lower than seen in low grade <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> All cases showed expression of the B lineage markers T 015, B 1, and 4 G 7, and HLA-DR. CALLA was present in all but 1 case, similar to that reported for <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> and much higher than reported for diffuse large cell lymphoma. Approximately one-half of the cases showed weak expression of Tac, 5 cases expressed B 2 (C 3 d), and 3 cases expressed T 05 (C 3 b). Variable expression was seen for the Ki- 67 antigen. A CR 4 / 23 +, B 2 +, T 05 + dendritic population was identified in all cases. An interfollicular host T-cell infiltrate was noted, mainly phenotypic helper cells. This study demonstrates that <b>follicular</b> large cell <b>lymphoma</b> has immunologic similarities to both diffuse large cell lymphoma and the low grade <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas...</b>|$|R

25|$|Interferons are {{produced}} by the immune system. They are usually involved in anti-viral response, but also have use for cancer. They fall in three groups: type I (IFNα and IFNβ), type II (IFNγ) and type III (IFNλ). IFNα has been approved for use in hairy-cell leukaemia, AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma, <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> chronic myeloid leukaemia and melanoma. Type I and II IFNs have been researched extensively and although both types promote anti-tumor immune system effects, only type I IFNs {{have been shown to}} be clinically effective. IFNλ shows promise for its anti-tumor effects in animal models.|$|E
25|$|Rituximab is a {{chimeric}} monoclonal IgG1 antibody specific for CD20, {{developed from}} its parent antibody Ibritumomab. As with ibritumomab, rituximab targets CD20, making it effective in treating certain B-cell malignancies. These include aggressive and indolent lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphoma</b> and leukaemias such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Although {{the function of}} CD20 is relatively unknown, CD20 may be a calcium channel involved in B-cell activation. The antibody's mode of action is primarily through the induction of ADCC and complement-mediated cytotoxicity. Other mechanisms include apoptosis and cellular growth arrest. Rituximab also increases the sensitivity of cancerous B-cells to chemotherapy.|$|E
25|$|Cancer {{can be seen}} as a {{disturbance}} in the homeostatic balance between cell growth and cell death. Over-expression of anti-apoptotic genes, and under-expression of pro-apoptotic genes, can result in the lack of cell death that is characteristic of cancer. An example can be seen in lymphomas. The over-expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein in lymphocytes alone does not cause cancer. But simultaneous over-expression of Bcl-2 and the proto-oncogene myc may produce aggressive B-cell malignancies including lymphoma. In <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> a chromosomal translocation commonly occurs between the fourteenth and the eighteenth chromosomes — t(14;18) — which places the Bcl-2 gene from chromosome 18 next to the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This fusion gene is deregulated, leading to the transcription of excessively high levels of Bcl-2. This decreases the propensity of these cells for apoptosis.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and diffuse lymphomas of small-cleaved-cell type was investigated {{with the use}} of a panel of antibodies against B-cell differentiation antigens. <b>Follicular</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> regardless of histologic subtype, were immunologically homogeneous: Ig+ B 1 + B 2 + CALLA+ Ia+. Two cases were Ig-negative, and 4 were CALLA-negative. Diffuse small-cleaved-cell (centrocytic) lymphomas were more heterogeneous. The majority were Ig+ B 1 + B 2 + Ia+ T 1 + CALLA-. A minority were B 2 -negative, T 1 -negative, or CALLA-positive. An increased frequency of Ig heavy chain class switching and loss of T 1 antigen suggest that <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> are at a later stage of differentiation than most centrocytic lymphomas. The differences in immunologic phenotype provide further justification for a classification that distinguishes between <b>follicular</b> and diffuse <b>lymphomas</b> of small-cleaved-cell types. The expression of Ig, Ia, B 1, and B 2 on neoplastic follicular center cells correlates with expression of these antigens on normal B cells. In addition, anti-B 2 appears to stain a nonlymphoid dendritic cell present in normal germinal centers and in both follicular and diffuse germinal center cell lymphomas in this study. In <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas,</b> the dendritic pattern was similar to that of normal follicles, while in centrocytic lymphomas a more irregular dendritic pattern was seen. Dendritic staining was seen in both nodal and extranodal lymphomas, suggesting that these nonlymphoid cells either migrate with neoplastic B cells or are present in a variety of normal tissues...|$|R

2500|$|Hematopoetic {{progenitors}} expressing CD10 {{are considered}} [...] "common lymphoid progenitors", {{which means they}} can differentiate into T, B or natural killer cells. CD10 is of use in hematological diagnosis since it is expressed by early B, pro-B and pre-B lymphocytes, and by lymph node germinal centers. Hematologic diseases {{in which it is}} positive include ALL, angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma, [...] Burkitt lymphoma, [...] chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (90%), [...] diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (variable), [...] follicular center cells (70%), [...] hairy cell leukemia (10%), and myeloma (some). It tends to be negative in acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma. CD10 is found on non-T ALL cells, which derive from pre-B lymphocytes, and in germinal center-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma such as Burkitt lymphoma and <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphoma,</b> but not on leukemia cells or lymphomas, which originate in more mature B cells.|$|E

By using three bcl- 2 DNA probes, 21 cases of non-Hodgkin's B cell lymphoma arising from gastrointestinal mucosa and eight cases of <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> were examined. No rearrangement of the gene could be detected {{in the group of}} gastrointestinal lymphomas, although it was identified in 75 % of the <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> The findings suggest that these two groups of lymphomas are not a family at genetic level and support the earlier suggestion that B cell lymphomas arising from gastrointestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue are not of follicle center-cell lineage...|$|R
40|$|The {{reactivity}} of Leu 1 /T 101 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) was studied {{in a series}} of 69 lymphomas with B cell differentiation and was correlated with other cell markers.

T 101 /Leu 1 antigen was detected in 24 cases: CLL (11 of 11), diffuse centrocytic lymphomas (four of 11), <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> (none of 12), <b>follicular</b> and diffuse <b>lymphomas</b> (seven of 10) and one unclassified low grade lymphoma.

40|$|We {{studied the}} Ca 2 +-capture ability of {{follicular}} dendritic cells (FDCs) in tonsillar secondary lymphoid follicles (LFs) and {{the expression of}} six Ca 2 +-binding proteins (CBPs), caldesmon, S- 100 protein, calcineurin, calbindin-D, calmodulin, and annexin VI in LFs of various lymphoid tissues and caldesmon and S- 100 protein in neoplastic follicles of <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas.</b> First, Ca 2 +-capture cytochemistry revealed extensive Ca 2 + capture in the nuclei and cytoplasm of FDCs, but little or none in follicular lymphocytes. All six CBPs were localized immunohistochemically in the LFs and were always present in the basal light zone. Immunoelectron microscopic staining of FDCs was classified into two patterns: caldesmon was distributed in the peripheral cytoplasm like a belt; S- 100 protein, calcineurin, calbindin-D, and calmodulin were distributed diffusely in the cytosol. Annexin VI was, however, negative on FDCs. Immunocytochemistry also demonstrated CBP-positive FDCs within FDC-associated clusters isolated from germinal centers. In situ hybridization revealed diffuse calmodulin mRNA expression throughout the secondary LFs. These data indicate that the CBPs examined may regulate Ca 2 + in the different subcellular sites of FDCs, and the roles of CBPs may be heterogeneous. We also investigated the distribution of caldesmon and S- 100 protein in <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> on paraffin-embedded tissue sections. FDCs within grades I and II neoplastic follicles clearly expressed caldesmon, but not S- 100 protein, except a part of grade II neoplastic follicles. FDCs within grade III follicles showed no caldesmon, but frequently expressed S- 100 protein. These results demonstrate that the caldesmon and S- 100 protein staining patterns of grade I <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> {{are different from those}} of grade III <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> and suggest that FDC networks in grade I neoplastic follicles may be similar to those in the light zone within non-neoplastic follicles, FDC networks in grade III neoplastic follicles may be similar to those in dark and basal light zones within non-neoplastic follicles, and grade II follicles may be intermediate between grade I and grade III follicles...|$|R

40|$|Fluorescein {{conjugated}} lectins {{have been}} used as histochemical stains in lymph node sections from 22 patients with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Variations in the distribution and structure of glycoprotein sequences between the different types of lymphoma, and also normal nodes, have been detected. The lectin-binding patterns of neoplastic lymphocytes of small cell <b>lymphomas,</b> both <b>follicular</b> and diffuse, suggested a predominance of sialylated glycopeptides, as in normal small lymphocytes of the mantle zone of germinal centres. In contrast, the staining patterns of large cell <b>follicular</b> and diffuse <b>lymphomas</b> showed a greater diversity of carbohydrate structure, with enhanced cytoplasmic staining and increased numbers of incomplete oligosaccharide sequences. Heterogeneity of staining, together with reduced sialic acid expression at all cellular sites was a common feature of lymphoblastic lymphomas and seemed to be linked with a poor prognosis. The extracellular matrix of small cell <b>follicular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> showed altered saccharide content, but retained some degree of organization.
