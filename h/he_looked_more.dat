5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn thought <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like a jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood {{was offered a}} playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would have agreed to anything {{to escape from the}} mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
500|$|The Persona 3 protagonist was {{the first}} {{character}} Shigenori Soejima designed for the game. Early designs of the character made him look mature and collected since the artist viewed him as a [...] "cliche cool guy." [...] Soejima took longer to design the protagonist than any other character as the game's other characters would be made to complement his design. In Art of Persona 3, Soejima remarked that [...] "Initially, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> honest, like an ordinary, handsome young man. But, I worked to achieve greater ambiguity in his expression." [...] He further noted that the character managed to have a [...] "hidden coolness." [...] In retrospect, {{he found that the}} character was not ambiguous enough and thus when creating the [...] protagonist, Soejima made Yu Narukami with the idea that his entire personality be decided and portrayed by the player's in-game actions and decisions.|$|E
2500|$|Marrero's pitches were {{primarily}} [...] "slow stuff—curves, sliders and knucklers." [...] Roberto González Echevarría provides the following description: [...] "A bit plump, {{of less than}} average height, with short arms and small hands, Marrero looked, in uniform, like someone in a baseball costume, not a player. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like a Spanish grocer or peasant than an athlete." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like Utam from Mighty Peking Man {{more than}} himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I see," [...] said Mrs. Dove, mildly interested. [...] "But <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like Robinson Crusoe {{without his}} umbrella. Adam {{did not kill}} the animals in the Garden, my dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] roared Doc Linyard. [...] "Confound {{you for a}} pair of landlubbers! Don't {{you know}} an honest figurehead when you see it? Look at him! 'Pears to me <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> {{straightforward}} than those as accuses him." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1988, the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{were looking}} for a {{replacement}} for their drummer D.H. Peligro, who had recently been fired. Already into the process of working on their fourth studio album and hiring new guitarist, John Frusciante, the band held open auditions for a new drummer. Smith {{was one of the last}} drummers to audition for the band and the band felt that on looks alone, Smith would be the wrong fit as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> hair-metal than punk. Nonetheless, the band was blown away by his audition. Singer Anthony Kiedis admired Smith and found his persistence impressive. Smith joined the Chili Peppers in December 1988 and within a few months was recording his first album with the band, Mother's Milk. Smith reflected on joining the band in a 2012 interview by saying “I remember thinking, ‘Oh, cool, they have a record deal. Great! I’d love to be in a band that has a record deal. We started playing, and right away we just hit it off musically. I was like, ‘Man, this is a blast! These guys are great!’ ... We were just doing what we do. We just jammed, which is what we still do today. It’s very similar.” ...|$|E
60|$|Again I {{shook my}} head, whereat <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> {{disappointed}} than before.|$|E
6000|$|... "High Jack grabs my arm {{and walls}} his eyes at me. Just then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like his eminent co-Indian murderer, Crazy Horse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think he}} can see us better this way. I often think that this blank thing is his real face, watching, though it cannot be watched. He! he! Yes, I think <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> nice from behind. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> cruel from behind, don't you think?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Regal Eagle, {{an eagle}} (although <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a buzzard) who talks and thinks like a soldier. This {{character}} {{is the least}} featured of the Bluffers and is often only called upon to perform a small task in any plans the animals may have.|$|R
50|$|At the {{starting}} page, it shows {{two of the}} main characters, Boodleheimer and the Easter Bunny (although <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a worm), and is later changed to Mother Goose. It also has {{a boy and a}} girl as the main characters, whose names are J.B. and Louise.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> puzzled than guilty, {{and once}} more she chafed against {{the fact that she}} could give him no {{opportunity}} of defending himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Along with Major Wood, behind Montague House," [...] said Mr. Billings. [...] "I'VE {{heard on}} it." [...] And here <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> knowing than ever.|$|E
6000|$|His manner was suggestive, though <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> {{resigned}} than disturbed, and Prescott, {{glancing at}} the shattered crock, ventured a question which he feared was not quite judicious: ...|$|E
6000|$|PETKOFF. Excuse my shirtsleeves, gentlemen. Raina: {{somebody}} has been wearing that coat of mine: I'll swear it--somebody with bigger shoulders than mine. It's all burst {{open at the}} back. Your mother is mending it. I wish she'd make haste. I shall catch cold. (<b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> attentively at them.) Is anything the matter? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It looks desp'rately like it, father," [...] {{answered}} the eldest born, {{who might have}} been well termed the heir at law of all his progenitor's squatting and fierce propensities. [...] "If he isn't a downright lawyer, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like one than any man I ever seed out of court, in my whull life." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{bent forward}} again eagerly towards me, as <b>he</b> spoke; <b>looking</b> <b>more</b> {{inquisitive}} and more cunning than ever.|$|R
6000|$|... "Were you--ahem!--looking for me?" [...] {{asked the}} doctor, weakly. And now the boys noticed that <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> {{dissipated}} than ever, {{and that his}} garments were decidedly shabby.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Ercott raised herself. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> {{good than}} ever; a little perplexed frown had climbed {{up with his}} eyebrows and {{got caught in the}} {{wrinkles}} across his forehead.|$|E
60|$|Her eye was {{the first}} to detect Robert in waiting at the terminus, but <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> {{depressed}} than ever, and scarcely smiled as he handed them to the carriage.|$|E
60|$|She spoke very correct English {{with the}} {{slightest}} of foreign accents. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> once <b>more</b> into her eyes.|$|R
50|$|A pint-sized sorcerer with a lisp, <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> far <b>more</b> {{like his}} father who makes an {{appearance}} in the manga.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> once <b>more</b> {{about the}} lovely room. The ocean wind tore {{at the windows}} with wolfish claws, savage to enter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} are reserving me for some grand occasion," [...] said the Rocket; [...] "no doubt {{that is what}} it means," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> supercilious than ever.|$|E
6000|$|Uncle Lot's patriotism {{began to}} bestir itself; and now, {{if it had}} been any thing, as he said, but [...] "that 'are flute"--as it was, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> than once at James's fingers.|$|E
60|$|Soames {{raised the}} corner of his lip in a smile, and looked across at Bosinney. The {{architect}} was grinning behind the fumes of his cigarette. Now, indeed, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like a buccaneer.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} half an hour the {{proprietor}} put in an appearance. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> even <b>more</b> worried than the day previous.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> once <b>more</b> {{firm and}} stern. He took the glass from my hand.|$|R
5000|$|A Dogū-type Time Shifter who {{can make}} people dance. Jitterbug-Con (Haniwaru) looks like a ceramic vase-like {{creature}} that can eat earthenware and shoot them from his mouth. As Jitterbug-Master (Sūpā Hanihani), <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> humanoid with big arms and chest and he can perform the Power Whirl attack. Found in 2nd century AD Japan {{during the reign of}} Queen Himiko.|$|R
60|$|Captain Barclay did {{not share}} in the general enthusiasm and, each morning at breakfast, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> and more grave as, upon opening the papers, he found {{there was still no}} news of the {{commencement}} of hostilities.|$|E
60|$|Miss Salome looked troubled. Perhaps {{there was}} {{something}} in Clemantiny's argument. And she hated to think of seeing Chester go. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like Johnny than ever, as he stood there with his flushed face and wistful eyes.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> sharply at his host, as if vaguely {{suspicious}} of a trap; then not less vaguely he sighed. [...] "Well, it's what I came up for--to try you all. But do {{they live on}} that?" [...] he continued.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Waddington looked curiously at his assistant, and {{the longer}} <b>he</b> <b>looked,</b> the <b>more</b> {{convinced}} <b>he</b> became that Burton was not himself.|$|R
60|$|He {{scarcely}} {{seemed to}} be the prisoner. What with his coolness and his soldierly bearing, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> far <b>more</b> like the prison guard.|$|R
500|$|Breyer's pragmatic {{approach}} to the law [...] "will tend to make the law more sensible"; according to Cass Sunstein, Breyer's [...] "attack on originalism is powerful and convincing". In 2006, Breyer said that in assessing a law's constitutionality, while {{some of his colleagues}} [...] "emphasize language, a more literal reading of the [...] text, history and tradition", <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> closely to the [...] "purpose and consequences".|$|R
