5|$|At the Luthor Mansion, Tess Mercer (Cassidy Freeman) {{is confronted}} by Granny Goodness, who offers her one final chance to join Darkseid's forces to spare her life during the coming destruction. Tess refuses, declaring that, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> {{was born a}} Luthor, her fate is not sealed. At Watchtower, {{discovering}} that Oliver Queen (Justin Hartley) disabled the organization's satellites, Tess brings up previous satellite footage revealing the planet Apokolips descending toward Earth. Before Tess can warn the team, she is ambushed {{by a group of}} armed men and taken captive. Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey meet in their lair. Oliver—possessed by the power of Darkseid—arrives and is instructed to remove Clark's powers with a gold kryptonite wedding ring. At the wedding, Chloe realizes the ring is kryptonite and stops Oliver. Clark helps Oliver overcome Darkseid's control just as Apokolips enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Since LGBT {{people began}} to {{organize}} for their social and legal rights, access to equal health care has remained an important but often not primary issue. LGBT-specific health organizations have been formed, including charities educating on specific issues, health clinics, and even professional organizations for LGBT people and their allies. Many of them have advocated for specific changes to various governmental practices, and the ongoing effort to legalize same-sex marriage often includes examples of LGBT people unable to secure health coverage equivalent to that of their heterosexual counterparts. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States includes new protections for LGBT people. Under the ACA insurers can no longer turn someone away <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> or he is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. In addition, ACA is funding preventive efforts for communities, including {{millions of dollars to}} use evidence-based interventions to address HIV-related health disparities. The Department of Health and Human Services is working with community centers serving the LGBT community to employ proven prevention strategies.|$|E
500|$|Marcos {{allegedly}} owned assets worth US$10 billion. On one occasion, {{she spent}} $2,000 on chewing gum [...] at the San Francisco International Airport and, on another, she forced {{a plane to}} do a U-turn mid-air <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> forgot to buy cheese in Rome. Her collection of shoes now lies partly in the National Museum of the Philippines and partly in a shoe museum in Marikina. Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) damaged her ancestral home in Tacloban, which {{also serves as a}} museum, although she still retains homes in Ilocos Norte and Makati, where she resides.|$|E

6000|$|... "Rotten? I {{should say}} so! It isn't done. I mean to say, chap can't chuck a girl <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> lost her money. Simply isn't on the board, old man!" ...|$|R
60|$|Nonsense. A man isn't {{obliged to}} marry a woman <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> in love with him. I don't see why loving should give one a claim on the person one loves.|$|R
500|$|I had {{no doubt}} that Barbra would sing the hell out of 'We're Not Making Love Anymore' – and not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> is one of the world's {{greatest}} singers. I began writing the song from the heart during my divorce, and Barbra sang it from heart in the studio. I was not at all shocked when her single immediately hit the Top 10 of the Adult Contemporary charts in 1989 [...] As much as that song means to me – I'm proud and thankful to have co-written it – I'll never be able to hear it without associating it with a sad time in my life.|$|E
500|$|Hanna-Barbera {{founder and}} {{chairman}} Joseph Barbera considered Real Adventures a [...] "disaster" [...] because of changes to the characters and stories. He conceded, [...] "that's their business. Everybody needs {{to do their own}} thing." [...] Critics generally enjoyed the characters and voice acting. People liked the cast, particularly George Segal. Saturday Morning Fever praised Jessie Bannon for her resemblance to Dr. Quest. Allan Johnson approved of the age jump, as Jonny and Hadji were now old enough {{to be part of the}} action. He considered Jessie [...] "cool... she gives Jonny grief <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> can, and she's not afraid of the action." [...] He did not enjoy the [...] "toned down" [...] portrayal of Race Bannon. Some fans objected to Race's Western accent in the first season. Peter Lawrence defended the portrayal of Race as a [...] "man of action, not thought—though perfectly capable of deep thought", noting that his accent and mannerisms encouraged variety, surprise, and originality.|$|E
500|$|... "Venganza", (Vengeance) speaks {{up against}} the mistreatment of women, which embodies what Queen {{represents}} within her musical compositions. The mid-tempo, [...] "bubble-gum pop" [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] (Daddy I Love You), {{named one of the}} album's biggest hits, [...] "pairs a straightforward love song with the well known reggae riddim Buyout." [...] Ramiro Burr of Billboard stated [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] showcases how [...] "effortlessly and quickly she alternately sings and raps, claiming that she has a distinct vocal style that evokes Gwen Stefani". Although, the literal translation of [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] is [...] "Daddy I Love You", it is not directed towards Queen's father but to her love interest; [...] "Papi" [...] can be translated to [...] "baby". [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] (I Want To Dance) incorporates the Liquid riddim, a musical riddim produced by the [...] "Jamaican cross-over guru" [...] Jeremy Harding. The song's lyrics [...] "warn her dance partner not to misinterpret her moves." [...] She degrades her partner who thinks that <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> dances with him that she is automatically going to have sexual relations with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Mae, if she'd opened to-night, they'd {{have had}} to give her two weeks' notice or her salary. But they can fire her without a cent <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> only been rehearsing and hasn't given a show!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Eggs, prunes, baseballs, anything. But Wild Water, you're makin' a mistake. They ain't no crowd ever {{sat at the}} Opery House that'll {{stand for}} it. <b>Just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> a actress is no reason you can {{publicly}} lambaste her with hen-fruit." ...|$|R
5000|$|Don Markstein asserts: [...] "The Scarlet Witch {{is unique}} among superheroes, and not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> {{the only one}} who wears a wimple. Her super power is unlike any other—she can alter {{probability}} so as to cause mishaps for her foes. In other words, she 'hexes' them." ...|$|R
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
2500|$|Matsushima {{was born}} on November 7, 1982 in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. She made her AV debut at age 19 in May 2002 with the video Virgin Love for the Media Station Cosmos Plan label. She {{is quoted as saying}} about her debut [...] "I became an AV actress because this is not {{something}} I can do later in my life". In another interview she says she got into AV work to financially help her boyfriend who was an AV director. She has also said that she started <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> wanted to buy a car and travel abroad.|$|E
2500|$|... "Hillary {{is missing}} in action from the Palin-hating brigade", opines a writer at the Weekly Standard. Former Democratic presidential {{candidate}} Hillary Clinton referred to Palin's VP nomination as [...] "historic," [...] stating, [...] ""We should all be proud of Governor Sarah Palin's historic nomination, and I congratulate her and Senator McCain...While their policies would take America in the wrong direction, Governor Palin will add an important new voice to the debate." [...] Wisconsin Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin expressed a different view: [...] "To the extent that this choice represents an effort to court supporters of Hillary Clinton's historic candidacy, McCain misjudges the reasons so many voters rallied around her candidacy. It was Senator Clinton's experience, skill and commitment to change, especially {{in the areas of}} health care and energy policy, that drew such strong support. Sarah Palin's opposition to Roe v. Wade and her support of big oil will not draw Democrats from the Obama-Biden ticket." [...] President of the National Organization for Women (NOW) Kim Gandy said [...] "What McCain does not understand is that women supported Hillary Clinton not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was a woman, but because she was a champion on their issues. They will surely not find Sarah Palin to be an advocate for women." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And even you, my child, don't {{know the}} worst," [...] she remarked. [...] "There's Fenillon, my dressmaker. She doesn't {{send me a}} bill at all, but I owe her nearly six hundred pounds. I {{have to wear a}} shockingly unbecoming gown in the second act, as it is, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> getting disagreeable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a {{shame to}} torment us as she does, knowing how poor we are and how happy a little of her money would make us. I'm tired of being a slave to a cruel old woman <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> rich. If {{it was not for}} mother, I declare I'd wash my hands of her entirely, and do the best I could for myself." ...|$|R
50|$|In court, Chrissy defends {{her sister}} {{by telling the}} court of her own abuse. The judge apologizes to Kelly, stating that <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> a child doesn't make her a liar, while also {{revealing}} that he wants a full investigation into Patrick's and Chrissy's allegations. While Mary and Nini are shocked at the situation, Kelly walks out with Chrissy and Patrick, pleased that she was finally believed.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{anonymous}} interview, the jury foreman stated, [...] "When I {{had to sign}} off on the verdict, the sheet that was given to me—there was just a feeling of disgust that came over me knowing that my signature and [...] signature were {{going to be on the}} same sheet," [...] but that [...] "there was a suspicion of [...] " [...] that played a part in the jury's deliberations. The foreman stated his work experience enabled him to read people and that George Anthony [...] "had a very selective memory" [...] which stayed with the jurors, emphasizing that the jury was frustrated by the motive, cause of death, and George Anthony. [...] "That a mother would want to do something like that to her child <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> wanted to go out and party," [...] he said. [...] "We felt that the motive that the state provided was, in our eyes, was just kind of weak." [...] Although the foreman objected to Casey Anthony's behavior in the wake of her daughter's death, he and the jury did not factor that behavior into their verdict because it was not illegal. They initially took a vote on the murder count, which was 10–2 (two voting guilty), but after more than ten hours of deliberation, they decided the only charges they felt were proven were the four counts of lying to law enforcement.|$|E
2500|$|Lisa {{is invited}} to join the school debate team, but soon discovers that she faces {{prejudice}} from the brunette supremacist judges because she has blonde hair. This prejudice follows her during the town meeting when Cletus mocks her concerns over the freedom infringement. Marge's attempt to comfort her fails, and Lisa hears Bart make comments against blondes even though Bart himself is blonde. When she calls him out for being prejudice against blondes, Bart defends himself by pointing out how the dumb blonde-stereotype mostly just applies to women and girls, while men and boys with blonde hair are expected to be evil and conniving rather than unintelligent. In a moment of kindness, Bart admits that he knows Lisa is the only exception to the blonde stereotype and this was his way of encouraging her to continue her fight against it. Dyeing her hair brown, [...] a newly determined Lisa deliberately presents a weak argument at the next debate meeting in favor of school uniforms and conformity. Nevertheless, she receives praise from the judges and earns the wrath of her rival, Megan, who realizes that because Lisa is now a brunette, she has levelled the playing field. Lisa is horrified when she learns the judges agreed with her simply because of her darker hair and not the strength of her debate skill. She points out their bias toward brunettes, prompting the only female judge on the panel to proudly admit her belief in the blonde stereotype. Her confession wound up embarrassing the other male judges who tried to earlier convince Lisa that her argument was strong in support of school uniform and didn't unanimously vote <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was brunette. Lisa urges the audience not to blindly follow stereotypes as they all have exceptions. She uses herself being an intelligent blonde and nearby Comic Book Guy being obese, but very miserly as prime examples. However, one of her claims - that not all old people are bad drivers - is immediately undermined when Grampa Simpson crashes his car through the wall of the school gymnasium where the debate is being held. In spite of the setback, many are encouraged by Lisa to look past the stereotypes and Megan appears to have lost the debate because she could no longer take advantage of the stereotypes.|$|E

No special guests, no costume changes - just Beyoncé, her heels, her thighs, her leather-and-lace corset and a {{freewheeling}} romp through her songbook, ignoring most of her proven crowd-pleasers <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> Beyoncé and Beyoncé can get away with doing whatever Beyoncé feels like doing."

50|$|Act two {{opens on}} Wesley and Emma in the kitchen, where Wesley is {{building}} a new front door for the house. Emma and Wesley discuss whether their mother will come back, or whether she will run off to Mexico with Taylor. Wesley and Emma then argue over {{who is going to}} go add water to the artichokes that are boiling on the stove. Wesley doesn’t want to do it because he is making the door and Emma doesn’t want to do it <b>because</b> <b>she</b> is remaking her posters. Wesley says that Emma doesn’t want to do it <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she’s</b> “on the rag”, so she throws down her markers and gets up to add the water.|$|R

[...] She goes to great lengths to {{disguise}} herself as Hannah in order to keep her true identity a secret, <b>because</b> <b>she</b> is worried that if people knew her secret they would like her <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> famous. The only people who knew she's Hannah before revealing her identity to the world in I'll Always Remember You, outside of her family are her best friends, Lilly Truscott, Oliver Oken and her bodyguard Roxy.

5000|$|Although sailor styling is {{sometimes}} seen on women's dresses, since the mid-20th century it is mainly associated with dresses for babies and small children. During the late 20th century sailor styling became associated with maternity dresses, {{which has led}} to some negativity towards sailor styles for womenswear and the general idea of a woman dressing 'like a child'. The maternity clothing designer Liz Lange declared [...] "She shouldn't have to dress like a child <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> having a child; it's one thing to put a toddler in a sailor suit but it's another thing completely to condemn a grown woman to such a fate." ...|$|R
