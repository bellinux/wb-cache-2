Nikolaj Arcel, the film's director and co-writer, said [...] "Matthew is an incredible actor who can do anything. That’s how I feel about [...] He could do anything." [...] Arcel described Walter as having [...] "a very interesting way of seeing the world. He sees it {{with a sort of}} delight, even though he is obviously {{on the wrong side of}} the light-and-dark spectrum. He’s someone I’ve been having a lot of fun with." [...] McConaughey described Walter with [...] "I enjoyed approaching my character as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Devil having a good time, getting turned on by exposing human hypocrisies wherever he finds them." ...|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people {{would look at me}} as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the May 11, 2016 Toronto Star {{article by}} Jacques Gallant cited above, public {{relations}} expert Martin Waxman {{spoke of a}} [...] "damning indictment" [...] of the CBC which included the following comment. [...] "Yes, they did their inquiry, but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> CBC, I would think strongly about {{what is wrong with}} the culture and what they can do to repair it," [...] he said. [...] The Star also quoted employment lawyer Howard Levitt stating that [...] "harassment has not been fully addressed at the CBC" [...] in his estimation. Levitt called the Rubin report a [...] "whitewash" [...] and reiterated his suggestion that a federal commission should conduct a more detailed enquiry into workplace issues at the public broadcaster.|$|E
2500|$|Alcibiades {{thought at}} the time that Socrates really only wanted him sexually, and by letting Socrates have his way with him he would entice Socrates to teach him {{everything}} he knew (217a). Yet Socrates made no move, and Alcibiades began to pursue Socrates [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> lover and he my young prey!" [...] (217c). When Socrates continually rebuffed him, Alcibiades began to view Socrates as the only true and worthy lover he had ever had. So he told Socrates that it seemed to him now that nothing could be more important than becoming the best man he could be, and Socrates was best fit to help him reach that aim (218c-d). Socrates responded that if he did have this power, why would he exchange his true (inner) beauty for the image of beauty that Alcibiades would provide. Furthermore, Alcibiades might be wrong and Socrates may be of no use to him (218e-219a). Alcibiades spent the night sleeping beside Socrates yet, to the deep humiliation of Alcibiades, Socrates made no sexual attempt (219b-d).|$|E

6000|$|... 'Ma'am,' said Mr Boffin, 'the Court (<b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> Court) does object. The Court {{objects for}} two reasons. First, because the Court don't think it fair.

6000|$|... 'It's a {{proof of}} the {{kindness}} of human nature,' said Tom, characteristically putting himself quite {{out of sight in}} the matter, 'that everybody who comes here, as you have done, is more considerate and affectionate to me than I should have any right to hope, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> most sanguine creature in the world; or should have any power to express, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> most eloquent.

6000|$|... "Good God," [...] said Mr. Cooke, whose {{contempt}} for Mr. Trevor was now infinite, [...] "you talk as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> {{governor of the}} state. What the devil could I do with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{that subject}} I will not listen. I have felt very sore and angry ever since {{you told me}} last night {{to leave the room}} when Sholto insulted me, as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> aggressor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{care not}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one to go, my Lord," [...] said Chandos; [...] "my men are aver kept in readiness, and a night's gallop {{will do the}} lazy knaves all the good in the world." ...|$|R

6000|$|Then Theseus frowned, and said, ‘This seems {{indeed an}} ill-ruled land, and adventures enough {{in it to}} <b>be</b> tried. But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> heir of it, I will rule it and right it, and here is my royal sceptre.’ ...|$|R
