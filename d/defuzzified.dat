40|$|This {{thesis is}} about proposing {{a method of}} <b>defuzzifying</b> fuzzy time-variant series on {{forecasting}} demand by developing time-variant model considering Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and trend of primary forecasting (MAE&Trend). The previous method of <b>defuzzifying</b> was based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN). <b>Defuzzifying</b> by ANN needs model identification which is time consuming. To justify the robustness of the proposed method, it is compared with Song‘s and Chen‘s fuzzy time-invariant methods as well as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time series method. Advantage of fuzzy method is its robustness in covering large range of data including linguistic data as well as numerical {{and its ability to}} forecast by small amount of data. Accuracy of the methods is achieved by comparing Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The MAPE results are modified by omitting outranged data to have more logical evaluations. Based on the evaluations, the proposed model of MAE&Trend shows better accuracy in forecasting demand...|$|R
30|$|Finally, given a {{fuzzy set}} that {{encompasses}} {{a range of}} output values, we need to return one number, thereby moving from a fuzzy set to a crisp output. To do so, the system will <b>defuzzify,</b> i.e., resolve all the assessments into a single crisp command.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we <b>defuzzify</b> the {{triangular}} fuzzy numbers. Actually defuzzification is {{the conversion of}} fuzzy number to precise or crisp number. There are several methods to do such type of conversion. Here we use three types of defuzzification, first one is followed by Kumar and Kaur (2011), second by Sen and Bhunia (2014) and third by Pramanik and Roy (2008).|$|R

50|$|Each {{column of}} the table maps to the output {{provided}} in the last row. To obtain {{the output of the}} system, we just average the outputs of each rule for that output. For example, to calculate how much the computer is Enemies with the player, we take the average of how much the computer is Unafraid, Distrusting, and Unloving of the player. When all three averages are obtained, the result can then be <b>defuzzified</b> by any of the traditional means.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{model of}} an optimal control problem with chance {{constraints}} is introduced. The parameters of the constraints are fuzzy, ran-dom or fuzzy random variables. To <b>defuzzify</b> the constraints, we consider possibility levels. By chance-constrained programming the chance constraints are converted to crisp constraints which are neither fuzzy nor stochastic and then the resulting classical optimal control problem with crisp constraints is solved by the Pontryagin Minimum Principle and Kuhn-Tucker conditions.

40|$|Based on {{the joint}} work [2] with Brunella Gerla and Vincenzo Marra Defuzzification {{is a key}} step in many fuzzy system applications. On a very general level, <b>defuzzifying</b> a fuzzy set f: X → [0, 1], means associating with f a {{definite}} real number r ∈ X.

First, we fuzzify the storing cost a, backorder cost b, cost of placing an order c, total demand r, order quantity q, and shortage quantity s as the triangular fuzzy {{numbers in the}} total cost. From these, we can obtain the fuzzy total cost. Using the signed distance method to <b>defuzzify,</b> we get the estimate of the total cost in the fuzzy sense. Two special cases of the optimal solu-tions on fuzzifying the storage quantity and order quantity as triangular fuzzy numbers will be treated numerically by the Nedler-Mead algorithm...|$|R
5000|$|A {{common and}} useful {{defuzzification}} technique is center of gravity. First, {{the results of}} the rules must be added together in some way. The most typical fuzzy set membership function has the graph of a triangle. Now, if this triangle were to be cut in a straight horizontal line somewhere between the top and the bottom, and the top portion were to be removed, the remaining portion forms a trapezoid. The first step of defuzzification typically [...] "chops off" [...] parts of the graphs to form trapezoids (or other shapes if the initial shapes were not triangles). For example, if the output has [...] "Decrease Pressure (15%)", then this triangle will be cut 15% the way up from the bottom. In the most common technique, all of these trapezoids are then superimposed one upon another, forming a single geometric shape. Then, the centroid of this shape, called the fuzzy centroid, is calculated. The x coordinate of the centroid is the <b>defuzzified</b> value.|$|E

In this model, we consider a fuzzy opportunity cost and trapezoidal fuzzy costs under crisp production quantity or fuzzy production quantity {{in order to}} extend the traditional production inventory model to the fuzzy environment. We use Function Principle as arithmetical operations of fuzzy total production inventory cost (FTPIC), and use the Graded Mean Integration Representation method to <b>defuzzify</b> the fuzzy total production and inventory cost. Then we use the Kuhn-Tucker method to find the optimal economic production quantity of the fuzzy production inventory model. ...|$|R

A fuzzy Neyman-Pearson hypothesis test concept which accepts {{any number of}} fuzzy parameters is presented. A suitable decision rule is developed by applying theory for ordering fuzzy numbers, and {{stated in terms of}} a fuzzy threshold. A <b>defuzzifying</b> threshold is then applied to produce a crisp decision rule. The concepts developed here are applied to Neyman-Pearson detection of a fuzzy fixed amplitude signal in Gaussian noise with fuzzy variance. 1...|$|R

To validate the models and the solution procedures we apply them to a transformer manufacturing, 'Iran transfo', company. Furthermore we design a decision support system which can be used for efficient evaluation of the proposed models in fuzzy environment...|$|R
30|$|The input {{degree of}} {{membership}} {{is determined by}} the trapezoidal input membership functions. A lower average packet delay and loss rate causes rule 1 to have a higher degree of membership. Therefore, μmax is maximum as given by the centroid of the highest area triangle membership function as shown in Figure 6. On the other hand, μmax is set to minimum when a higher average HoL delay and packet loss rate causes the smallest area triangle to be <b>defuzzified</b> through rule 2 and rule 3. If the normalized average delay is lower and average PLR is higher than the medium area, triangle is <b>defuzzified</b> as given in rule 4.|$|E
