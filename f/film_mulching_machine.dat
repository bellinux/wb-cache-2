40|$|Plastic <b>mulching</b> <b>film</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in development of agriculture. However, a series of problems such as pollution of plastic film residue left in the field occur. It is required to make a reasonable assessment on <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> and rationally utilize it. Based on its application, this study proposed a concept of crop safety period of plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching,</b> and its estimation methods. Crop safety period through plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> means the appropriate choice of a photo-selective <b>mulch</b> <b>film</b> according to the transplant season, to the pedoclimatic conditions of the area under cultivation and, finally, to the type of crop. In the days before the transplant, the plastic <b>mulching</b> <b>film</b> should be basic whole, and it works to decrease soil moisture evaporation, to warm soil and to prevent weeds. Successively, these functions almost reduce. The selection of crop safety period of plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> is helpful to manage agricultural activities efficiently; guiding film makers to produce both meet the demand of production and lower cost of plastic products; to help farmers due to the types of crop and production conditions choosing appropriate plastic <b>mulch</b> <b>film.</b> Based on measurement of function of plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching,</b> and crop canopy density, 2 kinds of method were established. The first one is to continuously monitor soil moisture，temperature and weed control, to build relationship between the function of soil temperature, moisture, weed suppression and mulching treatments, with that to seek the intersection of them. The coincidence point means functions disappear of plastic mulching and the days from starting mulching to this date is a certain crop safety period in a certain site. The second is crop canopy density to determine crop safety of plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> period, which includes 2 steps: to measure the change of crop canopy density, and the functions (soil temperature and moisture etc.) of mulching under no mulching and mulching at same time, to establish the curve of crop canopy density and the main function of plastic film in order to cross the best condition between crop canopy density and the contribute of <b>mulch</b> <b>films</b> aimed to the determination of the ideal crop safeguard period. All in all, plastic <b>mulching</b> <b>film</b> has been widely used in global, especially in China, in the past 30 years, and its application area and efficacy works better than any other agronomic practices. Concept of crop safety period of plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> has been firstly proposed in this paper, and further research in the connotation and extension of its definition still need to be developed.

Compared with bare field and new <b>film</b> <b>mulching,</b> soi 1 moisture of re-used film were higher significantly 1. 5 percentage points in 0 - 100 cm, and especially 1. 9 or 2. 6 percentage points in 0 - 10 cm during sunflower’s growth stage. Soil water of re-used film {{was more than that}} of bare field 24. 8 mm (in 2010) and 33. 0 mm (in 2011) before seeding, and 21. 6 mm (in 2010) and 24. 5 mm (in 2011) at harvest when soil water was replenished to same level for each treatment before sowing. Meanwhile, the grain yield of re-used film was higher significantly than that of bare field 11. 4 % (in 2010) and 16. 8 % (in 2011), and WUE of re-used film was higher significantly 15. 7 % (in 2010) and 22. 7 % (in 2011) respectively, no significant with new film. So it was worth to apply re-used film to agriculture production for improving the soil moisture, enhancing water use efficiency and increasing the yield of sunflower.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effect of mulching {{and nitrogen}} fertilizer on the soil water content, soil nitrate-N content and vertical distribution in maize root-zone. The experiment was conducted over two consecutive years and used randomly assigned field plots with three replicates. The six treatments consisted of no fertilizer without plastic film (CK), plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> with no basal fertilizer and no top dressing (MN 0), basal fertilizer with no top dressing and no mulching (BN 1), plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> and basal fertilizer with no top dressing (MN 1), basal fertilizer and top dressing with no mulching (BN 2) and plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> with basal fertilizer and top dressing (MN 2). In the top soil layers, the soil water content was a little high in the plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> than that without mulching. The mean soil water content from 0 to 40 cm without mulching were 3. 35 % lower than those measured in the corresponding mulching treatments in 31 days after sowing in 2012. The mulching treatment increased the soil nitrate-N content was observed in the 0 - 40 -cm soil layers. The results indicate that high contents of soil nitrate-N were mainly distributed at 0 - 20 -cm at 31 days after sowing in 2012, and the soil nitrate-N concentration in the MN 2 treatment was 1. 58 times higher than that did not receive fertilizer. The MN 2 treatment greatly increased the soil nitrate-N content in the upper layer of soil (0 - 40 -cm), and the mean soil nitrate-N content was increased nearly 50 mg kg- 1 at 105 days after sowing compared with CK treatment in 2012.

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the effects of fertilization and plastic-film mulching on aggregate stability and organic C in aggregates of a brown soil based on a long-term(29 years) field experiment. Fertilization treatments included application of manure(M 4), application of nitrogen(N 4), combined application of manure and nitrogen(M 2 N 2), combined application of nitrogen and phosphorus(N 4 P 2), combined application of manure, nitrogen and phosphorus(M 4 N 2 P 1), and no fertilization(CK). Each treatment was either carried out alone or combined with plastic-film mulching. Results showed that long-term fertilization significantly increased the percentage of > 2 mm aggregates while significantly decreased that of 0. 25 ~ 2 mm aggregates when there was no <b>film</b> <b>mulching,</b> especially under application of manure as well as under application of nitrogen and phosphorus. Manure treatments(M 4, M 2 N 2, M 4 N 2 P 1) significantly increased soil organic C in all aggregates without <b>film</b> <b>mulching.</b> Application of manure alone also significantly increased the mean weight diameter of soil aggregates without <b>film</b> <b>mulching.</b> These results suggested that long-term manure application increased organic C sequestration in soil aggregates as well as aggregate stability. The fertilization treatment also significantly affected the stability of soil aggregates and the contents of organic C when there was <b>film</b> <b>mulching,</b> and compared with the control, only the high amount of manure(M 4 and M 4 N 2 P 1) treatment could significantly increase the average weight diameter of soil aggregates and the organic C contents of aggregates at all levels.

The effects of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers could significantly improve the average weight diameter of soil aggregates in different fertilizations and film treatments, but the effects on the organic carbon contents of aggregates were significantly decreased or not significant. Water-stable large aggregates are the main carriers of soil organic C in soil treatments, the application of manure, organic and inorganic combination is beneficial to promote the formation of water-stable aggregates and increase the organic C contents and it is an effective measure to improve the soil aggregate structure and maintain and improve the soil fertility of brown soil...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{hydrothermal}} {{condition is}} one of the most important factors affecting crop growth in arid regions. This study aimed to investigate the effect of mulching and tillage on moisture and temperature variations in soil under drip irrigation in the arid Hetao Irrigation District, northwest China. Four treatments were included: (1) alternating ridges (40 cm wide and 20 cm high) and furrows (40 cm wide) with plots fully <b>mulched</b> with plastic <b>film</b> (RFM); (2) alternating ridges (40 cm wide and 20 cm high) and furrows (40 cm wide) with partial <b>film</b> <b>mulch</b> (only the plant rows mulched) (RPM); (3) flat tillage with plots fully <b>mulched</b> with plastic <b>film</b> (FFM); and (4) flat tillage with partial <b>film</b> <b>mulch</b> (only the plant rows mulched) (FPM). The ridge tillage and plastic film increased soil temperature and significantly conserved soil water, and thus increased the maize yield and water use efficiency (WUE). The RFM treatment had a greater effect than the RPM, FFM, and FPM treatments on the soil moisture and water storage over 0 – 70 cm in depth during the entire growing period in 2014 and 2015, indicating that full transparent plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulch</b> increased soil water status and promoted deep water percolation, and ridge tillage further enhanced water redistribution to deep soils. Furthermore, RFM proportionally increased soil temperature by 0. 36 °C, 1. 49 °C, and 1. 27 °C above the temperatures under RPM, FPM, and FFM, respectively, in 2014 and by 1. 19 °C, 1. 62 °C, and 0. 35 °C, respectively, in 2015. During the drought year of 2014, tillage influenced temperature more than mulching; however, mulching played a more important role in preserving thermal conditions than tillage during the humid year of 2015. Consequently, RFM increased the maize yield and WUE significantly. We conclude that a combined system of full plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulch</b> and ridge tillage creates beneficial soil hydrothermal conditions under drip irrigation and thus promotes the growth and performance of field crops...|$|R
40|$|Plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> has {{commonly}} {{been used}} for adaptation to water scarcity and for increasing agricultural productivity on the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. However, the effect of plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> on cropland soil water and thermal regimes on the semiarid Loess Plateau of China is not well understood. This study simultaneously monitored {{the dynamics of the}} soil water content and the soil temperature with high resolution in a ridge cultivation system with plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> (RS) and a flat cultivation system without plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> (FS) during the maize (Zea mays L.) -growing season. We found that, in general, the soil temperature and soil water content were significantly different among the ridge under RS (RS-ridge), the furrow under RS (RS-furrow) and FS throughout the maize-growing season (P < 0. 05). Plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> increased the near-surface soil temperature by approximately 1 °C throughout the study period. RS significantly increased the soil water content during the dry period (May to June), especially within the middle soil layer (30 – 60 cm), compared to FS. The lowest monthly average soil water content was found at a depth of 30 – 60 cm layer in FS during the dry period (May and June). The water depletion was found within deeper (100 – 160 cm) soil layers in May but the water storage in the same layer of FS in June increased although it was the dry period, which differed from RS. The RS practices showed a longer period of water supply from the deeper soil layer (100 – 160 cm) in May and June for meeting maize water demands during the early growing stage rather than in only May for FS. During June (dry period), the water storage at a depth of 0 – 60 cm was greater in RS than in FS, and the reverse was true at a depth of 60 – 160 cm. The results indicate that the dry soil layer at a depth of 30 – 60 cm formed during June in FS likely reduced water movement from deeper layers to the topsoil layer, and hence constrained the availability of surface soil water for meeting maize water requirements during the early growing stage (dry period). Our study suggests that RS tends to significantly increase surface soil water availability by restraining the formation of a dry soil layer during the early maize-growth stage primarily under dry conditions, and thus enhances maize productivity in the semiarid Loess Plateau of China...|$|R

However, there is still limited information about the potentials for increased ecosystem carbon storage of this tillage method. The objective {{of this study was}} to quantify and contrast net carbon dioxide exchange, biomass accumulation and carbon budgets of maize (Zea maize L.) fields under the traditional non-mulching with flat tillage (CK) and partial plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> with furrow-ridge tillage (MFR) on the China Loess Plateau. Half-hourly net ecosystem CO 2 exchange (NEE) of both treatments were synchronously measured with two eddy covariance systems during the growing seasons of 2011 through 2013. At same time green leaf area index (GLAI) and biomass were also measured biweekly. Compared with CK, the warmer and wetter (+ 1. 3 °C and + 4. 3 %) top soil at MFR accelerated the rates of biomass accumulation, promoted greater green leaf area and thus shortened the growing seasons by an average value of 10. 4 days for three years. MFR stimulated assimilation more than respiration during whole growing season, resulting in a higher carbon sequestration in terms of NEE of - 79 gC/m 2 than CK. However, after considering carbon in harvested grain (or aboveground biomass), there is a slight higher carbon sink (or a stronger carbon source) in MFR due to its greater difference of aboveground biomass than that of grain between both treatments. These results demonstrate that partial plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulched</b> furrow-ridge tillage with aboveground biomass exclusive of grain returned to the soil is an effective way to enhance simultaneously carbon sequestration and grain yield of maize in the semiarid regions...|$|R

In conjunction with the water movement of evaporation from film hole studies, soil temperature distributions were also analyzed. Our measurements indicated that <b>film</b> hole <b>mulch</b> had a restraining effect on evaporation and that the restraining effect decreased with the increase in open hole ratios. Compared with bare soil evaporation, the percentage of evaporation reduction rates for open hole ratios of 0 %, 1. 39 %, 2. 84 %, 7. 24 %, and 30. 5 % were 69. 26 %, 33. 09 %, 22. 80 %, 20. 05 %, and 11. 82 %, respectively. The results showed a linear relationship between cumulative water evaporation and square root of time for the different open hole ratios of the perforated plastic mulches, and the coefficients of the linear function, i. e., the C parameters, were fitted well with the open hole ratios-u(C = 0. 0101 u(0. 1019) + 0. 0075). On this basis, mathematical relations of relative evaporation rate and evaporation based on hole areas of perforated plastic mulches were analyzed and discussed. These results extend the Gardner evaporation equation to bare soils to include water evaporation from soils covered by various perforated plastic mulches. The resulting equations presented in this paper provide an approach for describing evaporation from plastic mulch-covered soil...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaDue to {{the large}} amount of <b>mulch</b> <b>films</b> used in {{agricultural}} crops and to all the environmental problems related with their disposal, the biodegradable <b>mulch</b> <b>films</b> seems to be the best solution for replacing the conventional polyethylene mulches. The main goal of this work was to evaluate and compare the performance of biodegradable <b>mulch</b> <b>films</b> with the conventional polyethylene ones in muskmelon culture during two years. Beyond fruit productivity and quality, the impact of each plastic in the soil moisture and temperature were also assessed. Taking into account that there are no reported biodegradation studies realized in Portugal, it was also important to verify the biodegradability of this new <b>mulch</b> <b>films</b> under the Portuguese soil conditions. The biodegradable <b>mulch</b> <b>films</b> did not show significant differences in fruit productivity and quality. The biodegradation rate of the mulches tested was not as high as would be expected. From the overall results obtained, biodegradable <b>mulch</b> <b>films</b> appear to be a good solution for the replacement of the conventional polyethylene mulches, however the R&D should continue to be done to improve their biodegradation rate...|$|R
40|$|Livestock manure {{compositing}} on {{the cold}} Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is a feasible way to utilize manure while alleviating negative en-vironmental effects. In order to overcome unfavorable factors of cold temperature and shortage of manpower for composting operation, we de-veloped a new technique for composting livestock manure on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau:static ventilation-double-layer film insulation and studied the effect of it. The static ventilation had been achieved by ventilation pipes implanted in compost stacks while double-layer <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> had prevented heat loss from composting process. Composting trials showed that compared with pile turning over, the static ventila-tion pipes significantly shortened the time for temperature rise and reduced the temperature difference between interior and outer layers of compost stacks, and thus speeded up the composting process meanwhile reducing losses of nutrients during composting. The double-layer <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> further helped maintain the temperature of compost stacks. By this new technique, the operation of overturning compost stacks was not a necessity for composting livestock manure. Adding phosphorus fertilizers to manure for composting also helped to increase tempera-ture but this had a possibility to increase losses of nitrogen and organic matters from composts...|$|R

40|$|Intercropping is a {{well-established}} strategy for maximization of yield from limited land, but mixed {{results have been}} obtained as to its performance in terms of water use efficiency. Here, two maize/pea intercrop layouts were studied in comparison to sole maize and sole pea with and without plastic cover on maize to reduce evaporation. Growth patterns over time and yield were determined. Profiles of soil water content over depth and across rows in the intercrop were measured at three times to quantify water extraction and its spatial and temporal distribution. Several indices were calculated to characterize the efficiency of land and water use of intercrops as compared with sole crops of maize and pea. Land equivalent ratio ranged from 1. 18 to 1. 47, indicating that intercropping was an effective strategy for maximizing land use efficiency. Water equivalent ratio, WER, defined to characterize the use efficiency of the water resource in intercropping, in analogy with LER, ranged from 0. 87 to 1. 16, and ¿WU, the relative departure of actual water use in intercropping from expected use, ranged from - 13. 7 % to 19. 8 %, indicating variability in the effect of intercropping on water use efficiency. Plastic film in maize increased yield and water use efficiency, but did not significantly affect LER or WER, indicating that intercropping advantage was not affected by plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulch,</b> and the advantages of <b>film</b> <b>mulch</b> were conserved under intercropping. A cropping system of 4 rows maize with 4 rows peas, with 30 cm between maize rows and 20 cm between pea rows, was superior in yield and water use efficiency to a system with 2 rows maize and 4 rows of pea with 40 cm between maize rows and 20 cm between pea rows. It is concluded that intercropping of maize and pea enhances land use efficiency compared to growing them as sole crops. <b>Film</b> <b>mulch</b> saves water in sole crops as well as intercrops...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo better {{understand}} the effects of plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> on soil greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, we compared seasonal and vertical variations of GHG concentrations at seven soil depths in maize (Zea mays L.) fields at Changwu station in Shaanxi, a semi-humid region, between 2012 and 2013. Gas samples were taken simultaneously every one week from non-mulched (BP) and plastic film-mulched (FM) field plots. The {{results showed that the}} concentration of GHGs varied distinctly at the soil-atmosphere interface and in the soil profile during the maize growing season (MS). Both carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) concentrations increased with increasement of soil depth, while the methane (CH 4) concentrations decreased with increasement of soil depth. A strong seasonal variation pattern was found for CO 2 and N 2 O concentrations, as compared to an inconspicuous seasonal variation of CH 4 concentrations. The mean CO 2 and N 2 O concentrations were higher, but the mean CH 4 concentration in the soil profiles was lower in the FM plots than in the BP plots. The results of this study suggested that plastic <b>film</b> <b>mulching</b> significantly increased the potential emissions of CO 2 and N 2 O from the soil, and promoted CH 4 absorption by the soil, particularly during the MS...|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the size}} and {{orientation}} of the mulching head, forestry mulchers can only fell smaller trees. Mulchers with a mulching head that rotates about a vertical axis can typically handle trees up to 6-8 inches in diameter, while mulchers with a mulching head that rotates about a horizontal axis can handle trees up to 30 inches in diameter. Mulching trees at {{the upper end of}} this size range can be dangerous for both the equipment and the operator. Mulching areas with a variety of vegetation and terrain may require multiple pieces of equipment, including tracked <b>mulching</b> <b>machines,</b> excavator mulchers, and skid steer tractors equipped with mulching attachments.|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaAn {{enormous}} amount of plastic waste resulting from the agricultural activities is produced every year. Part of this plastic remains in the fields, while the other part is sent to recycling or landfill. The use of biodegradable <b>mulch</b> <b>films</b> {{can play an important}} role towards a sustainable development in agricultural sector. These plastics can be plugged in the soil, after its use, among the crop residues. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the performance of three different biodegradable <b>mulch</b> <b>films</b> (P 1, P 2 and P 3) against the conventional polyethylene <b>mulch</b> <b>film</b> (P 4), in the production of strawberries, during the autumn-winter cycle. The parameters followed during the crop cycle were yield, plant growth, fruit quality and pests and diseases. The biodegradable <b>mulch</b> <b>films</b> had different behaviors during the crop cycle, P 3 showing the best performance with 85 % soil coverage at the end of the crop cycle, followed by P 2 and P 1 with 70 % and 20 %, respectively. The soil coverage of the conventional <b>mulch</b> <b>film</b> was 100 %. Compared to conventional <b>mulch</b> <b>film,</b> biodegradable <b>mulches</b> led to a decrease in the yield and in the harvest index, while there was an increase in the total dry biomass of the plants. Results obtained also showed that overall quality of fruits was not affected by the type of plastic. As a conclusion, this innovative agricultural practice can be an interesting alternative and a good opportunity for the farmers to try these promising alternatives to PE, without compromising the economical viability of its use, if there isn´t any decrease in the total yield...|$|R
