His weapon failed to fire so he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door; Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Moving along the corridor he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman {{through the window of}} the door she had just locked.|$|E

25|$|These single-car {{units were}} {{originally}} built as two-car Class 155 units by Leyland from 1987–88, but were converted by Hunslet-Barclay at Kilmarnock from 1991-92. The class {{was built for}} lightly used lines, replacing first generation single coach units. The conversion involved building a new cab at the original inner ends of the vehicles. The layout of the original non-cab ends was subtly different from the original cab end, so the ends are noticeably different, and the vehicle not symmetrical. The new cab is significantly smaller than the original Leyland cab and pushes back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> area.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, student Lucinda Embry hears whispers while {{staring at}} the Sun. When her idea to make a time capsule is chosen by the school, each child draws what they believe the future will look like. Lucinda writes a page of {{seemingly}} random numbers for the time capsule, {{which is to be}} opened in 50 years. Lucinda's teacher calls for the pupils to finish but Lucinda continues until her teacher takes the page off her desk unfinished. Lucinda goes missing after the time capsule is dedicated, and is found in a utility closet scratching numbers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with her fingernails bleeding.|$|E

5000|$|The Poccar, {{named as}} [...] "pocket car", {{featured}} luggage compartments built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> exterior <b>door</b> panels. Both side doors were cut horizontally 3 the middle, {{and the lower}} portion dropped like a tailgate. In addition to the two lockable luggage compartments built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> there was ample luggage space inside and room for four passengers. The rear seat could also be folded down flat for increased cargo capacity. <b>The</b> side <b>door</b> luggage compartments protruded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> interiors of <b>the</b> <b>doors,</b> and served as armrests. Electronic instruments on the dashboard were clustered in a semi-circular pod which was clearly visible through {{the upper half of}} the steering wheel.|$|R
25|$|The car is spartan, {{although}} it features inflatable lumbar support and adjustable seats. Along with {{the absence of}} exterior door handles, the vehicle lacks side windows and a roof. Although a soft top cover was available, it was designed primarily for indoor vehicle storage. Side curtains of fabric and clear plastic operated by zippers can be inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and hand-bolted when needed. All of these decisions were made to reduce weight. The battery {{is located in the}} sealed compartment over the rear wheels to increase rear-end weight and traction. The car shipped with a tonneau cover and video tape on soft-top assembly (the soft top is removable and folds to fit in the trunk). In 1994 the car came, {{for the first time since}} release with several options available to the buyer. These included air conditioning, adjustable suspension, larger diameter wheels to accommodate larger brakes, and a fiberglass hardtop for the roof.|$|E
500|$|In August 1968 {{the unit}} created a [...] "Total Encounter Capsule", {{which was a}} windowless, soundproofed room, [...] wide and [...] long, with green-painted walls, a green wall-to-wall mat {{on the floor and}} a ceiling {{containing}} a one-way mirror. It was empty apart from a sink and lavatory. In one of the earliest uses of videotape in therapy, television cameras were trained through the mirrored ceiling and through holes in the walls. Liquid nourishment was provided through drinking straws that were built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> The Capsule's purpose, Barker writes, was to provide [...] "a place of undisturbed security where a small group of patients could focus on issues they felt important enough to warrant the exclusion of the usual physical and psychological distractions." [...] Though participation in the STU programme was required, entering the Capsule was voluntary, and each patient could choose how many days he spent inside. Groups numbered between two and seven and stayed in the room for as little as 24 hours or for sustained periods as long as 11 days. Because Barker believed that they were more inclined to reveal their inner selves if unclothed, the inmates entered the Capsule naked. To further encourage communication, they were administered with LSD-25. The room was lit at all times, making day indistinguishable from night. While members of the programme were inside the Capsule, other patients operated the room and watched over those inside, running the cameras, keeping records and maintaining an appropriate room temperature.|$|E

2500|$|Now Lachen [...] {{first went}} to Nepal and entered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of mantra through [...] Bhāro Ham-thung. Then he went to India itself and, realizing that the Āchārya Ratnākaraśānti was both greatly renowned and learned, he heard {{extensively}} the Vinaya, Prajñapāramitā, and mantra. Then having gone to {{the eastern part of}} India, he encountered Bhikṣu Vīravajra, who was the greatest direct disciple of Durjayachandra, who himself had held the lineage of Āchārya Virūpa's own disciple, Ḍombiheruka. From Bhikṣu Vīravajra he heard extensively the mantra material of the three tantras of Hevajra, complete in all their branches. He also requested the many instruction manuals of Acintyakrama and so forth, so that he heard the [...] "Lamdré without the fundamental text" [...] (rtsa med lam 'bras) as well. In this way, Drokmi lived in India for twelve years and became a great translator.|$|E
2500|$|The LF-Gh {{which stands}} for Lexus Future Grand-touring Hybrid is Lexus's latest LF concept vehicle which debuted at the 2011 New York International Auto Show. [...] The LF-Gh is a rear wheel drive hybrid {{platform}} powered by a Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain. The LF-Gh also provide a hint of what future Lexus models, mainly the Lexus GS which was scheduled for late 2011, might look like. The front {{and the back of}} the LF-Gh is equipped with LED headlights, daytime running lights, and taillights. To improve aerodynamics the LF-Gh's door handles are sealed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> panel and could be pushed to open out. the large spindle grille {{on the front of the}} LF-Gh brings out the aggressiveness of the design. Though the interior has been teased online, Lexus never once opened the doors of the LF-Gh to reveal the full interior, which is why most critics are rumoring that the LF-Gh is a nutshell concept, in which only the exterior has purpose, and the inside components are not made up.|$|E
2500|$|For 1992 the Century {{received}} another slight facelift {{featuring a}} bigger radiator grille and different headlamps. Also the interior received new door panels moving the window switches and door lock switches {{into a more}} convenient configuration found on more modern cars, where the switch location corresponds with the window location in the car body. Interestingly this feature never appeared on its sibling the Oldsmobile Ciera, which retained the inline switch bank mounted flush with the door panel, the rear switch being the drivers door window. Another interesting note is that the Century windows switches were not backlit, but lit by a small bulb in the door panel trim above the switch bank. Other interior changes included new seat covers, and relocating the front outboard seat belts from the A pillar <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> functioning as [...] "automatic" [...] seat belts so that the belts could be buckled and {{the door opened and}} closed while still buckled. The driver and front passenger could enter and exit the vehicle while the seat belt was still fastened.|$|E

2500|$|After the inventions of the {{combination}} lock, James Sargent—an employee of Yale—developed the [...] "theft proof lock." [...] This {{was a combination}} lock that worked on a timer. The vault or safe door could only be opened after a set number of hours had passed, thus a kidnapped bank employee could not open the lock {{in the middle of}} the night even under force. Time locks became widespread at banks in the 1870s. This reduced the kidnappings, but set bank robbers to work again at prying or blasting open vaults. Thieves developed tools for forcing open a tiny crack between the vault door and frame. As the crack widened, the thieves levered the door open or poured in gunpowder and blasted it off. Vault makers responded with a series of stair-stepped grooves in the door frame so the door could not be levered open. But these grooves proved ideal for a new weapon: liquid nitroglycerin. Professional bank robbers learned to boil dynamite in a kettle of water and skim the nitroglycerin off the top. They could drip this volatile liquid <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> grooves and destroy the door. Vault makers subsequently redesigned their doors so they closed with a thick, smooth, tapered plug. The plug fit so tightly that there was no room for the nitroglycerin.|$|E
2500|$|The satirist in Tsvetaeva plays second fiddle {{only to the}} poet-lyricist. Several satirical poems, moreover, {{are among}} Tsvetaeva's best-known works: [...] "The Train of Life" [...] ("Poezd zhizni") and [...] "The Floorcleaners' Song" [...] ("Poloterskaya"), both {{included}} in After Russia, and The Rat-catcher (Krysolov, 1925–1926), a long, folkloric narrative. The target of Tsvetaeva's satire is everything petty and petty bourgeois. Unleashed against such dull creature comforts is the vengeful, unearthly energy of workers both manual and creative. In her notebook, Tsvetaeva writes of [...] "The Floorcleaners' Song": [...] "Overall movement: the floorcleaners ferret out a house's hidden things, they scrub a fire <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>door...</b> What do they flush out? Coziness, warmth, tidiness, order... Smells: incense, piety. Bygones. Yesterday... The growing force of their threat is far stronger than the climax." [...] The poem which Tsvetaeva describes as liricheskaia satira, The Rat-Catcher, is loosely based on {{the legend of the}} Pied Piper of Hamelin. The Rat-Catcher, which is also known as The Pied Piper, is considered by some to be the finest of Tsvetaeva's work. It was also partially an act of homage to Heinrich Heine's poem Die Wanderratten. The Rat-Catcher appeared initially, in serial format, in the émigré journal Volia Rossii in 1925-1926 whilst still being written. It was not to appear in the Soviet Union until after the death of Joseph Stalin in 1956. Its hero is the Pied Piper of Hamelin who saves a town from hordes of rats and then leads the town's children away too, in retribution for the citizens' ingratitude. As in the other folkloric narratives, The Ratcatcher's story line emerges indirectly through numerous speaking voices which shift from invective, to extended lyrical flights, to pathos.|$|E

5000|$|The RVR was {{essentially}} a second generation Mitsubishi Chariot (known in some markets as the Space Wagon) with a shortened chassis and sharing {{the components of the}} longer vehicle.

There was no <b>door</b> for <b>the</b> rear passengers on the driver's side; only one sliding door was installed on the passenger side for all trim levels, and for all vehiches sold internationally. This was a different configuration from the larger Chariot in that the longer vehicle had conventional doors {{on both sides of the}} vehicle. Also, <b>the</b> Mitsubishi sliding <b>door</b> latched to a [...] "B" [...] pillar, whereas those of the Toyota and Nissan vehicles did not. The rear windows didn't retract <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> or body, instead they popped out at the back edge of the window.
