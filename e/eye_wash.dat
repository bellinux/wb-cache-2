A path leads towards the sea, mounting abruptly to the main level of the island--twenty or even thirty feet, although Findlay gives five; and just hard by the top of the rise, where the coco-palms begin to be well grown, we found a grove of pandanus, and a piece of soil pleasantly covered with green underbush.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: A pollen {{exposure}} chamber (OHIO Chamber) {{was built in}} central Tokyo, Japan, in order to study seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR). Since satisfactory outcomes {{were obtained from the}} controlled pollen exposure at the chamber, we conducted preliminary studies in volunteers with SAR. Methods: Ten volunteers with SAR sensitive to Japanese cedar (JC) pollen were enrolled in this study. In order to investigate the intranasal and intraocular pollen number, volunteers were initially exposed to a low concentration of JC (2500 grains/m 3) for at most 1 hour in this chamber. Before and after the exposure, nasal cavities and <b>eyes</b> were <b>washed</b> with 100 ml and 25 ml of saline, respectively. Nasal and <b>eye</b> <b>washing</b> solutions were collected and the number of JC pollen was counted. After 3 hours the volunteers were subsequently exposed to a moderate concentration of JC (4500 grains/m 3) for 2 hours. Subjective nasal and ocular symptoms were recorded and the amount of nasal secretion was measured during the allergen exposure periods. Results: During the initial exposure, all volunteers except one stayed in the chamber for 1 hour without any nasal or ocular symptoms. The number of pollen in the nose and eyes was 249. 2 ± 120. 9 and 13. 6 ± 13. 6 grains, respectively. During the subsequent 2 -hour exposure to JC pollen, nasal and ocular symptoms developed gradually in a time dependent manner in all the volunteers except one. Conclusions: This is the first clinical study using Japanese cedar pollen under well-controlled conditions in the OHIO chamber in which the induction of allergic symptoms was observed. The OHIO chamber will be useful for studying allergic rhinitis in Japan...|$|R

5000|$|Prolonged {{contact with}} {{propylene}} glycol is essentially non-irritating to the skin.

[...] However, limited human experience indicates that inhalation of propylene glycol mists could be irritating to some individuals.

50|$|Later on, {{when the}} breach {{of human rights}} had reached to it‘s climax and the {{international}} still remained silent about killing of innocent people, Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadri {{held a press conference}} in London, after when UN did not respond, to update the media and nation regarding the progress of putting up the Model Town Massacre case at the The International Court of Justice, which is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, 17th June 2014 was an act of state terrorism, 14 PAT workers martyred & over 90 injured, we were not even granted our fundamental the right to lodge an FIR, it was a massacre which was shown to the world via the eye of the electronic media, innocent PAT workers were butchered in broad day light and hurled upon with bullets, I classify this as a peak of state terrorism which continued for over 12 hours.The shameless government did not care less about the image and reputation of Pakistan, its law & constitution. The session judge, high court judge and their rightful verdicts to lodged the FIR was put aside, we protested for months to get our fundamental rights, Justice Baqir Najafi & the commission report has been tucked away, we also remember the statement of CM Punjab and his resignation if the reports even indicates the slightest towards his guilt. The report did just exactly just that and stated that the Punjab Police did exactly that what the CM desired, hence where is the resignation when all fingers are pointing at the CM of Punjab.The culprits mentioned in the FIR have been appointed & sent abroad, rewarded with high positions & the <b>eye</b> <b>wash</b> game was played by the inept rulers to wash its hands clean from the blood of the PAT martyrs, hence we today have travelled abroad for justice, we will struggle at each legal platform for justice. We have made contact with law firms in United Kingdom, France and Netherlands till this moment.We are currently undergoing our meetings and consultation and intend to approach the following:1. The Human Rights Council 2. The International Criminal Court will be approached, currently the law experts are looking into the technicalities to put forward the Model Town Massacre case, these courts of has announced sentences in the past for 14, 12, 18 years, some cases are ongoing regarding various politicians and state representatives.3. English High Court, Torture Convention 1984 which holds a universal jurisdiction.These 3 courts have been in our sight and we are working with lawyers to approach these forms in the most appropriate manner.On the other hand by which intention has the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif travelled to the UN to represent the Muslims of Kashmir, he intends to fight the case against PM of India, to that nation whom he has suspended the clearance procedure for, and has exempted the clearance & custom check procedure, who always remains silent when the neighbouring country renders threatening statements, the PM has always remained silent and by which face does he intend to represent and talk in favour the Muslims of Kashmir?I announced a list of 50 Indian nationals, with their passport numbers and date of arrival and departure in link with the sugar mills of the sitting PM, my question is why are all silent on this matter?The inept rulers have suspended all visa regulations, among the list of 300 Indian nationals working in the sugar mills of the PM, I have started to trace the visa duration, (Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadri showed a copy of the 10 year multiple visa acceptance of Namdee Shiridarh as a sample).We now want the democratic nations to come to know how this inept government is destabilising its nation and how they are violating the laws of human rights.The government is avoiding rangers operating in the province of Punjab to eradicate terrorism, an intentional delay to pack away the breeding grounds of terrorism. This will result in missing terrorists and only then rangers will be granted partial permission for operation.National sovereignty is the top most priory in my sight, I will continue to fight against terrorism till my last breath.|$|E
