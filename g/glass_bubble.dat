5|$|Gifford arrives, {{and most}} of the town attends the celebratory event, where Chef sings a song to seduce her. Mr. Garrison takes his {{position}} in a tall book depository, but he is frustrated to see that Gifford is hidden behind a bulletproof <b>glass</b> <b>bubble.</b> Wendy and Stan arrive and try unsuccessfully to stop Mr. Garrison, saying that they understand his pain, but when Stan accidentally reignites Garrison's anger, he decides to go through with the assassination. Just as he's about to fire, Cartman's new immense weight causes the stage to collapse, catapulting Gifford off it, and causing the bullet to hit Kenny in the head. Kenny is propelled through the air and impaled on a flagpole. Gifford's bodyguards whisk Gifford away, costing a disappointed Cartman his chance to be on television. Wendy takes to the stage and reveals that Cartman cheated on his essay, but the townspeople are too upset about Gifford's departure to care. Mr. Garrison is taken to a mental hospital, where Mr. Hat is placed into a straitjacket. Mr. Garrison apologizes to the kids for costing the town a chance to be on television, although Kyle explains to him that Cartman is now appearing on talk show Geraldo because of his tremendous obesity. The episode ends with Chef having sex with Gifford while watching Geraldo.|$|E

25|$|Glass was a {{desirable}} material for mirrors. Because {{the surface of}} glass is naturally smooth, it produces reflections with very little blur. In addition, glass is very hard and scratch resistant. However, glass by itself has little reflectivity, so people began coating it with metals to increase the reflectivity. Metal-coated glass mirrors are said by the Roman scholar Pliny the Elder to have been invented in Sidon (modern-day Lebanon) {{in the first century}} AD, although no archeological evidence of them date from before the third century. According to Pliny, the people of Sidon developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating blown glass with molten lead. Glass mirrors backed with gold leaf are mentioned by Pliny in his Natural History, written in about 77 AD. Because there were few ways to make a smooth piece of glass with a uniform thickness, these ancient glass-mirrors were made by blowing a <b>glass</b> <b>bubble,</b> and then cutting off a small, circular section, producing mirrors that were either concave or convex. These circular mirrors were typically small, from only a fraction of an inch to as much as eight inches in diameter. These small mirrors produced distorted images, yet were prized objects of high value. These ancient glass mirrors were very thin, thus very fragile, because the glass needed to be extremely thin to prevent cracking when coated with a hot, molten metal. Due to the poor quality, high cost, and small size of these ancient glass mirrors, solid metal-mirrors primarily of steel were usually preferred until the late nineteenth century.|$|E

The author replied in an interview with The Virginian-Pilot that some people in the world [...] "speak crudely" [...] and [...] "you can't put your child in a <b>glass</b> <b>bubble</b> and protect him always". Several West Virginian book reviewers have complained about the dialect in the novel, believing that West Virginians do not speak with a dialect.

500|$|Kathie Lee Gifford, then a {{television}} hostess {{on the morning}} talk show Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, {{was the first of}} many celebrities to be spoofed in a South Park episode. The South Park creators said they chose Gifford completely at random, not based on any particular reason or distaste for her. Shortly after [...] "Weight Gain 4000" [...] aired, the tabloid The Globe hired Suzen Johnson to film herself seducing Frank Gifford, Gifford's husband, for a newspaper story. The incident was the first of what Parker and Stone called the [...] "South Park Curse", in which something tragic or embarrassing supposedly happens to a celebrity shortly before or after they were featured in South Park. Actress Karri Turner provided the voice of Gifford in [...] "Weight Gain 4000", marking her first and only guest appearance on South Park. Gifford appears at a parade hidden inside a bulletproof <b>glass</b> <b>bubble.</b> The bubble was inspired by an appearance Pope John Paul II made in the Popemobile during a trip to Denver, which was attended by Parker and Stone. They thought the design of the Popemobile, which has a bulletproof booth built {{into the back of a}} modified truck, was [...] "hilarious". The design of the trophy that Gifford was to give to Cartman is a reference to Parker and Stone's 1997 film Orgazmo.|$|E
60|$|He advanced, and {{stretching}} out his hand, dragged the veil off, unmasking a still, unreadable face, against which his nervous exasperation was shattered like a <b>glass</b> <b>bubble</b> flung against a rock. “That’s better,” he said, {{to cover his}} momentary uneasiness, and retreated back to his old station by the mantelpiece. It never entered his head that his wife could give him up. He felt a little ashamed of himself, for he was fond and generous. What could he do? Everything had been said already. He protested vehemently.|$|E
50|$|Lightweight (i.e. low density) ECC {{have been}} {{developed}} through the addition of air voids, <b>glass</b> <b>bubbles,</b> polymer spheres, and/or lightweight aggregate.

40|$|Conventional protein {{affinity}} chromatography relies on highly porous resins that have large surface areas. These properties {{are ideal for}} fast flow separation of proteins from biological samples with maximum yields, but these properties {{can also lead to}} increased nonspecific protein binding. In certain applications where the purity of an isolated protein {{is more important than the}} yield, using a glass solid phase could be advantageous as glass is nonporous and hydrophilic and has a low surface area and low nonspecific protein binding. As a proof of principle, we used protein A-conjugated hollow glass microbubbles to isolate fluorescently labeled neurofilament heavy chain spiked into serum and compared them to protein A Sepharose and protein A magnetic beads (Dynabeads) using an anti-neurofilament protein antibody. As expected, a greater volume of <b>glass</b> <b>bubbles</b> was required to match the binding capacity of the magnetic beads and Sepharose resins. On the other hand, nonspecific protein binding to <b>glass</b> <b>bubbles</b> was greatly reduced compared to the other resins. Additionally, since the <b>glass</b> <b>bubbles</b> are buoyant and transparent, they are well suited for isolating cells from biological samples and staining them in situ...|$|R

60|$|After {{the cold}} {{gust of wind}} there was an {{absolute}} stillness of the air. The thunder-charged mass hung unbroken beyond the low, ink-black headland, darkening the twilight.

A little to the left, between the black masses of the headland and of the forest, the volcano, a feather of smoke by day and a cigar-glow at night, took its first fiery expanding breath of the evening.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimization of a lightweight biopolymer drilling fluid for underbalanced drilling (UBD) using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Concentrations of four raw materials (<b>glass</b> <b>bubbles,</b> clay, xanthan gum and starch) were varied to analyze {{their effects on}} three vital responses: density, plastic viscosity (PV) and yield point (YE') of the fluid. Based on the results, the optimum condition was achieved at concentrations of <b>glass</b> <b>bubbles,</b> clay, xanthan gum and starch of 24. 46 w/v, 0. 63 w/v, 0. 21 w/v and 2. 41 w/v, respectively.
