The use of Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) products for structural applications in seismic area has not been properly contextualized in the current <b>European</b> <b>technical</b> <b>standard.</b> In <b>order</b> to bridge this gap, many national and international companies are promoting experimental activities with the main aim of investigating and interpreting the seismic behaviour of these systems. In this framework, an important collaboration between the University of Naples “Federico II” and the Lamieredil S. p. A. company started in the last years. In particular, the research activity involves the experimental characterization of the seismic response of strap-braced CFS walls by means of monotonic and cyclic tests on full-scale prototypes. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the influence of the main structural components on the global response, the experimental campaign is completed with tests on materials and main connection systems...|$|R

50|$|Registration may be {{conditional}} on the vehicle being approved {{for use on}} public highways, {{as in the case}} of the UK and Ontario. Many US states also have requirements for vehicles operating on public highways. Aircraft have more stringent requirements, as they pose a high risk of damage to people and property in event of an accident. In the US, the FAA requires aircraft to have an airworthiness certificate. Because US aircraft must be flown for some time before they are certified, there is a provision for an experimental airworthiness certificate. FAA experimental aircraft are restricted in operation, including no overflights of populated areas, in busy airspace or with unessential passengers. Materials and parts used in FAA certified aircraft must meet the criteria set forth by the <b>technical</b> <b>standard</b> <b>orders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The type {{certificate}} (TC) implies that aircraft manufactured {{according to the}} approved design can be issued an Airworthiness Certificate. Examples of regulatory authorities are the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). To meet those requirements the aircraft and each sub-assembly must also be approved. For example, in the U.S. these sub-assemblies must meet requirements in the applicable <b>Technical</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Order</b> (TSO). To meet those requirements the design documents are examined for compliance with the applicable Minimum Operating Performance Standards (MOPS) applicable to that sub-assembly. MOPS are published by RTCA, Inc. When aircraft are produced to meet a given TC, each one need not be tested as rigorously but the confidence demonstrated by the TC is conferred, when the aircraft has been assigned an Airworthiness Certificate.|$|R
5000|$|As of 1973, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{standard}} for transponder minimal operational performance, <b>Technical</b> <b>Standard</b> <b>Order</b> (TSO) C74c, contained errors which caused compatibility problems with {{air traffic control}} radar beacon system (ATCRBS) radar and Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) abilities to detect aircraft transponders. First called [...] "The Terra Problem", there have since been individual FAA Airworthiness Directives issued against various transponder manufacturers {{in an attempt to}} repair the operational deficiencies, to enable newer radars and TCAS systems to operate. Unfortunately, the defect is in the TSO, and the individual corrective actions to transponders have led to significant differences in the logical behavior of transponders by make and mark, as proven by an FAA study of in-situ transponders. In 2009, a new version, TSO C74d was defined with tighter technical requirements.|$|R

40|$|SEAS (Simplified Energy Auditing Software) is an {{open access}} tool for energy audits of {{residential}} and office buildings, developed by the University of Pisa (Department of Energy, Systems, Territory, and Construction Engineering), in collaboration with ENEA (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy, and Sustainable Economic Development), under a funding of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The analyzed services are: winter heating by hydronic systems, production of domestic hot water, and lighting and other electrical uses. Production of heat and electricity by renewable energy sources (solar thermal, photovoltaic, biomass heat generators, and heat pumps) is also calculated. The application assesses the different energy flows contributing to the energy balance of the building system on a monthly basis. The calculation methods are based on Italian and <b>European</b> <b>technical</b> <b>standards,</b> properly modified {{to take into account}} daily schedules of building usage. The tool has been developed with the intention of spreading energy auditing activities, thanks to the definition of a unified and inexpensive procedure, comprising the economic evaluation of retrofit actions by means of common investment metrics. All the worksheets are freely accessible to energy auditors, together with technical and user manuals (in Italian). Local Governments are expected to promote the use of SEAS, as part of their energy efficiency strategies. As for the reliability of energy calculations, they have been double-validated by both dynamic simulation results (tests have been run on TRNSYS 17) and comparison with actual energy billings.

40|$|Modern design methods {{described}} in the current Italian or <b>European</b> <b>Technical</b> <b>Standards</b> are generally based on the comparison between the demand calculated in terms of forces or base shear associated with the design earthquake, and the corresponding capacity. This design philosophy {{can be seen as}} the natural result of the historical evolution of the study of structural dynamics and strictly related to how buildings are usually designed for other actions, such as dead and live loads: if the strength capacity of the structure and of its elements does not exceed the applied loads, the collapse will occur. For applied loads this approach has a strong physical basis. In fact, usual not-seismic load such as dead, live, snow and, with some approximations, wind load, can be considered as statically applied to the building or to some structural elements and the load does not suddenly change neither in intensity or in direction. So, once the strength capacity is exceeded, the element is not longer able to resist to the applied loads and collapse occurs. However, several limitations have been recognized to the force-based design, as detailed {{described in}} Chapter 2, and with the intent of overcoming these deficiencies and recognizing that the most suitable parameter to evaluate the response of buildings to the action of the earthquake is represented by the displacements and the deformations induced in the building itself, many different displacement-based design (DBD) methods have been proposed and developed during the last decade (Calvi, 2003). In order to develop an actually applicable Direct DBD method also for steel MRF structures, recommendations that account for different joint typologies would be needed, including the effects that different joint components have on non-linearity, hardening, damage of mechanical properties, pinching’ and so the global behavior of the whole structure. Within this thesis work, the influence of joint hysteretic behavior, detailing, non-linearity, hardening, cyclic damaging on the displacement and dissipative capacity of steel MRFs is studied from a DBD point of view...|$|R
