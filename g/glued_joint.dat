A properly <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> may be as strong or stronger than {{a single piece of}} wood. However, glue is notably less effective on end-grain surfaces. Animal glue is soluble in water, producing joints that can be disassembled using steam to soften the glue.|$|E
50|$|An {{exception}} is the high-frequency gluing, where the <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> is heated via a capacitor field/ condenser field, which significantly reduces the pressing time. Therefore, this method is suitable for very thick moldings. Since veneer is a natural product, {{it is necessary to}} observe certain limitations in the pressing process. The smallest radius is dependent on the veneer thicknesses used and is 12 mm at a 90 degree angle. A taper of the moulded parts is possible.|$|E
5000|$|Finger-jointed lumber - solid {{dimensional}} lumber lengths {{typically are}} limited to lengths of 22 to 24 feet, but can be made longer by the technique of [...] "finger-jointing" [...] by using small solid pieces, usually 18 to 24 inches long, and joining them together using finger joints and glue to produce lengths that can be up to 36 feet long in 2×6 size. Finger-jointing also is predominant in precut wall studs. It is also an affordable alternative for non-structural hardwood that will be painted (staining would leave the finger-joints visible). Care is taken during construction to avoid nailing directly into a <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> as stud breakage can occur.|$|E

The <b>glue</b> <b>joint</b> between the laminate and the steel plate guarantees even distribution of the displacement during tests. The method of connecting laminates by means of <b>glue</b> <b>joints</b> leads to the connection with the smallest overall dimensions and weight.

5000|$|Typically the top (also {{known as}} the belly or table, in the U.K.) -- the instrument's soundboard) is made of quarter-sawn spruce, bookmatched at a {{strongly}} <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> down the center, with two sound-holes (or [...] "f-holes", from their resemblance to a stylized letter [...] "f") precisely placed between the C-bouts and lower corners. The sound-holes affect the flex patterns of the top, or table, and allow the box to breathe as it vibrates. A decorative inlaid set of three narrow wooden strips, usually a light-colored strip surrounded by two dark strips, called purfling, runs {{around the edge of}} the top, and is said to give some resistance to cracks originating at the edge. It is also claimed to allow the top to flex more independently of the rib structure. Some instruments have two lines of purfling, or have knot-work type ornaments inlaid in the back. Painted-on [...] purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument. A slab-sawn bass bar fitted inside the top, running lengthwise under the bass foot of the bridge, gives added mass and rigidity to the top plate. Some cheaper mass-produced violins have an integral bass bar, carved from the same piece as the top. Ideally the top is glued to the ribs and linings with slightly diluted hide glue, to allow future removal with minimal damage.|$|E
40|$|Glass panes {{structurally}} {{bonded to}} a steel framework {{can be used}} as a stability system for buildings. A system built up of a single glass pane, a steel frame and a <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> is only loaded by a concentrated monotonic in-plane load at the top. Three <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> types are defined, namely a flexible joint on the end, a two-sided and a one-sided rigid joint. A finite element model was developed and calibrated with the experiments followed by varying the geometry of the glass pane. The applied criteria are the strength of glass for failure and the restricted in-plane displacement at the top. The system with a flexible joint on the end can be characterized by small loads, large inplane displacements and small stiffnesses. The stiffness is the criterion. Systems with two-sided and one sided rigid joints can be characterized by larger loads, much smaller,in-plane displacements and larger stiffnesses. The strength of glass is the criterion and is located on the glass pane's surface in the vicinity of the <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> which anchors the tensile diagonal of the glass pane. These tensile stresses increase by the different in stiffness of the <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> (rigid) and the less shear stiffness of the bolts between beadwork and outside beam of the frame. However, the stress distribution in the glass pane as well as in the <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> is unfavourable for systems with one-sided rigid joint. The two-sided rigid <b>glued</b> <b>joint</b> is a promising joint type based on the geometric parameters of the glass pane and the good residual capacity after the first cracks as observed in the experiments...|$|E

50|$|The {{significant}} {{disadvantages of}} hide glue - its thermal limitations, short open time, and vulnerability to micro-organisms - are offset by several advantages. Hide <b>glue</b> <b>joints</b> are reversible and repairable. Recently <b>glued</b> <b>joints</b> will release easily with {{the application of}} heat and steam. Hide glue sticks to itself, so the repairer can apply new hide <b>glue</b> to the <b>joint</b> and reclamp it. In contrast, PVA glues do not adhere to themselves once they are cured, so a successful repair requires removal of the old glue first - which usually requires removing some of the material being glued.|$|R
