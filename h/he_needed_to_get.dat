5|$|Morrison {{took three}} years to release a {{follow-up}} album. After a decade without taking time off, {{he said in an}} interview, <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from music completely and ceased listening to it for several months. Also suffering from writer's block, he seriously considered leaving the music business for good. Speculation that an extended jam session would be released either under the title Mechanical Bliss, or Naked in the Jungle, or Stiff Upper Lip, came to nothing, and Morrison's next album was A Period of Transition in 1977, a collaboration with Dr. John, who had appeared at The Last Waltz concert with Morrison in 1976. The album received a mild critical reception and marked the beginning of a very prolific period of song making.|$|E
5|$|During 1794, Southey {{began to}} plan with Coleridge and others about a {{political}} system that they would start in America called Pantisocracy. <b>He</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> money for the project and he contacted Richard Cruttwell on 19 July 1794 to publish Joan of Arc for that end. After notifying Bedford about the plan, Bedford advised Southey to contact William Nicol, a London publisher, to publish the work and raise more money. Southey did find a publisher, Joseph Cottle, to print his poem. A notification for the publication of Joan of Arc was included in a publication of Southey's poems later in 1794, but the edition was stopped from being printed since it lacked the minimum of 50subscribers {{to pay for the}} cost. The poem was finally published by Cottle in 1796 (see 1796 in poetry) after changes to the text including a section added by Coleridge. The second edition would later be printed without Coleridge's lines and they were instead published on their own. For the second edition, Southey revised many lines and added more research to the work. It was printed in May 1798. Later editions were published in 1806, 1812, and 1837, with the final one further toning down Southey's republican sentiment.|$|E
25|$|Land was, {{after some}} conflicts, {{acquired}} or expropriated and construction was started. The construction {{was completed in}} 1908 and employed between 200 and 300 people. Originally the plans were to only build the line from Thamshavn to Svorkmo while the stretch from Svorkmo to Løkken was to be operated by a cable car. But Thams soon realised {{that this was a}} mistake and decided to extend the line to Løkken. This caused some problems since <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> permission from the Ministry of the Interior and was not allowed to operate passenger traffic all the way to Løkken before 1910. The line between Thamshavn and Svorkmo was opened on 10 July 1908 by King Haakon VII while the last section to Løkken was opened on 15. August 1910 by Prime Minister Wollert Konow.|$|E

500|$|In 1947, at the {{prompting}} of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer, ahbez approached Nat King Cole's manager {{backstage at}} the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles, {{handed him a}} tattered copy of [...] "Nature Boy", {{and asked him to}} show it to Cole. However, his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of [...] "Nature Boy" [...] with Cole's valet, Otis Pollard. From him, Cole came to know of the song and loved it. Cole began playing [...] "Nature Boy" [...] for live audiences, and he received much acclaim. Irving Berlin, who was present during one of the performances, initially offered to buy the track from Cole, but Cole decided to record it for himself. <b>He</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> permission from ahbez, however, before releasing it as a single, but {{he was not able to}} find the songwriter since ahbez had disappeared without providing any contact details. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign, Cole got his permission and recorded the song.|$|E
500|$|Starr's {{wife had}} a strong aversion to insects and McCartney {{recalled}} she was once [...] "trapped in her room {{because there was a}} fly over the door." [...] Spiders, mosquitoes and flies were present at the ashram and when Starr complained to the Maharishi he was told: [...] "For people travelling in the realm of pure consciousness, flies no longer matter very much." [...] Starr found the food [...] "impossible" [...] because he was [...] "allergic to so many different things" [...] and he and his wife left India on 1 March saying [...] "I wouldn't want anyone to think we didn't like it there;" [...] they returned home [...] "because we missed the children." [...] Their departure was precheduled by one account, but premature by others. McCartney and Asher departed in mid to late March as <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back to London to supervise Apple Corps and she had a theatrical commitment. When he left he told another student, [...] "I'm a new man". Alex Mardas arrived after McCartney left, either at Lennon's invitation or on his own initiative.|$|E
500|$|Strasburg {{had hoped}} to attend Stanford University but was not {{accepted}} there. Although recruited {{by a number of}} schools across the country, he enrolled at San Diego State University, where both of his parents attended school. He played college baseball for the San Diego State Aztecs, coached by the late Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Tony Gwynn. When he first arrived, he was an unlikely candidate to pitch collegiate baseball at all; he was so overweight and out of shape that his conditioning coach nicknamed him [...] "Slothburg" [...] and encouraged him to quit baseball. He also had a difficult time adjusting to college life, moving out of his dormitory and in with his mother after five days. He acknowledged, [...] "I wasn't the most mature guy out of high school. … The dorm was an overload, too much, too soon." [...] Strasburg responded with an intense workout regimen, losing [...] in the process. He also worked to improve his mental toughness. Coaches tested him by placing him in high-pressure situations and telling him <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> strikeouts.|$|E

500|$|Some unseen or unheard-of {{elements}} of the story were fleshed out {{in the course of}} the novel. Such examples include more discussions between Anakin and Palpatine, in which Palpatine explicitly says that Darth Plagueis was his master; in the film, it is merely hinted at. Additionally, it is revealed that the primary reason for Anakin's outrage over not becoming a Jedi Master is that only Masters have access to the holocrons in the Temple Archives, which is where Anakin had hoped to find information about how to prevent Padmé's death. Not only is Saesee Tiin revealed to be a telepath, but his horn, lost in the Clone Wars, is revealed to have grown back. The book explains that Palpatine purposely manipulated the Council into sending Obi-Wan to fight General Grievous, because he knew <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Obi-Wan off Coruscant before he could turn Anakin to the dark side. The novel also reveals Mace Windu's rationale for not bringing Anakin along to the fight with Palpatine: he can sense Anakin's fear and distress, and does not believe the young Jedi is in any mental state to fight a Sith Lord. These are a few examples of many descriptions of characters' feelings and inner narrative. There are even some humorous lines added in, including extra dialogue in the battle between Grievous and Obi Wan - Grievous says, [...] "I was trained by Count Dooku," [...] and Obi-Wan replies, [...] "What a coincidence; I trained the man who killed him." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

His tutor, Ryan Kraft a senior from Farmington Hills, was a great help in his academic performance and took him the distance where <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to." [...] In June 2009, Ringer and the other Titan rookies appeared at a local hospital to celebrate National Cancer Survivors Day. Ringer also went to a V.A. hospital in November 2009 with other Titans to celebrate Veterans Day. Ringer graduated from Michigan State University in May 2015.|$|E

2500|$|After the Winter Garden shows, however, Diamond {{announced}} that he needed a break, and he engaged in no more live performances till 1976. He used those four years {{to work on the}} score for Hall Bartlett's film version of Richard Bach's Jonathan Livingston Seagull and to record two albums, Serenade and Beautiful Noise. He said years later, [...] "I knew I'd come back, but I wasn't sure when. I spent one year on each of those albums...I'd been on the road six years. I had a son 2½ and I felt he needed me more than the audience did. So for four years I devoted myself to my son Jesse."

2500|$|Responding to this criticism, Karen Mead of Japanator.com disagreed, {{writing that}} [...] "in Asuna's case, her actions are {{instrumental}} {{to her own}} rescue; if she hadn't broken out of her cell and gone exploring late in the show, Kirito wouldn't have gotten the card <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to where she was and rescue her", thus invalidating {{her role as a}} damsel in distress technically, though the criticism itself was still seen as valid. The claim that Kirito serves as a [...] "Gary Stu" [...] type character was also contested, citing his relationship with Asuna. Nevertheless, Eisenbeis praised the fourth arc of Sword Art Online as it focuses primarily on Asuna's point of view – an [...] "excellent choice" [...] in his opinion, as it [...] "allows Asuna, who suddenly went from strong female lead to weak damsel in distress in the series’ second arc, to once again come into her own and develop as a character."

2500|$|On 6 October Cheney {{left the}} band {{because he felt}} burnt out, he was sick of the {{constant}} touring, as well as experiencing writer's block. Cheney felt that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away from the band and develop other aspects of his life. This information was kept confidential until 2008. Early in 2007 Cheney had isolated himself from his bandmates while trying to write tracks for a follow-up to State of Emergency. He was disappointed with the results so he took up yoga, spent time painting and being around his baby daughter whilst {{taking a break from}} music {{for the first time in}} 10 years. During this period the band released a radio-only single, a cover version of Cold Chisel's [...] "Rising Sun", available on the Standing on the Outside (March 2007), a Cold Chisel tribute album by various Australian artists. After Cheney overcame his writer's block and was convinced not to leave the band, the group played The Great Escape in April 2007 and restarted work on their fifth studio album. They toured the UK in August that year, releasing State of Emergency there on 13 August through Deck Cheese Records.|$|E
