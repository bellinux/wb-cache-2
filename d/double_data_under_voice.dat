50|$|Some trunked systems queue calls if a user's {{attempt to}} {{transmit}} gets a busy signal. In other words, if someone presses their push-to-talk button and all trunked radio system channels are busy, some systems will wait-list {{users in the}} same order as their busy signals occur. When a channel becomes available, the system notifies the user. There is disagreement about MultiNet's ability to queue calls when all channels are busy. Usually, the control channel is the path allowing wait-listed users to get in line. One publication says MultiNet communicates using low baud rate <b>data</b> multiplexed <b>under</b> <b>voice</b> if all channels are busy. One report says MultiNet users on a live system who got a busy had to either hold their push-to-talk button down continually until the system assigned them a channel or periodically check for an available channel by repeatedly pressing the push-to-talk.|$|R

For normal speech both methods exhibited a very good effectiveness of speaker recognition and the results for the subjective method were a bit lower (98. 9 % in comparison to 99. 4 % for the objective method). <b>Under</b> <b>voice</b> disguise conditions, however, the mean results for the subjective method (92. 3 %) were substantially better than for the objective one (77. 2 %) ...|$|R

25|$|In computing, DDR4 SDRAM, an {{abbreviation}} for <b>double</b> <b>data</b> rate fourth-generation synchronous dynamic random-access memory, {{is a type}} of synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) with a high bandwidth ("double data rate") interface.|$|R
50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>data</b> rate SDRAM (DDR) was a later {{development}} of SDRAM, used in PC memory beginning in 2000. Subsequent versions are numbered sequentially (DDR2, DDR3, etc.). DDR SDRAM internally performs double-width accesses {{at the clock}} rate, and uses a <b>double</b> <b>data</b> rate interface to transfer one half on each clock edge. DDR2 and DDR3 increased this factor to 4× and 8×, respectively, delivering 4-word and 8-word bursts over 2 and 4 clock cycles, respectively. The internal access rate is mostly unchanged (200 million per second for DDR-400, DDR2-800 and DDR3-1600 memory), but each access transfers more data.|$|R
50|$|In January 2016, JEDEC {{standardized}} GDDR5X SGRAM. GDDR5X targets {{a transfer}} rate of 10 to 14 Gbit/s per pin, {{twice that of}} GDDR5. Essentially, it provides the memory controller the option to use either a <b>double</b> <b>data</b> rate mode that has a prefetch of 8n, or a quad data rate mode that has a prefetch of 16n. GDDR5 only has a <b>double</b> <b>data</b> rate mode that has an 8n prefetch. GDDR5X also uses 190 pins per chip; (190 BGA). By comparison, standard GDDR5 has 170 pins per chip; (170 BGA).
