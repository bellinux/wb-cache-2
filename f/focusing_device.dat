50|$|Simon’s {{contributions}} to CERN and accelerator physics speak for themselves. These started with magnet {{design in the}} 28 GeV Proton Synchrotron (PS) era in the 1950s and the 1961 invention of a pulsed <b>focusing</b> <b>device,</b> known as the ‘van der Meer horn’. Such devices are necessary for long-base-line neutrino facilities and are used even today.|$|E
50|$|A {{magnetic}} horn or neutrino horn (also {{known as}} the Van der Meer horn) is a high-current, pulsed <b>focusing</b> <b>device,</b> invented by the Dutch physicist Simon van der Meer in CERN, that selects pions and focuses them into a sharp beam. The original application of the magnetic horn was {{in the context of}} neutrino physics, where beams of pions have to be tightly focused. When the pions then decay into muons and neutrinos or antineutrinos, an equally well-focused neutrino beam is obtained.|$|E
50|$|Crayfords {{began to}} be popular among amateur {{telescope}} makers for being easy to make without any high precision machining, yet providing precise focusing with no gear slop or backlash. This trend picked up steam as commercial Crayfords, while being relatively inexpensive, proved to be superior to most rack-and-pinion devices. They became the default <b>focusing</b> <b>device</b> on many amateur telescopes just above entry level, and better. They are made {{in a variety of}} designs by companies specializing in amateur telescope supplies, with such features as dual speed focusing and interface to motorized, or robotic, focusing.|$|E
40|$|Design and {{optimization}} of a {{low energy}} plasma focus for enhancing charged particle emission and x-ray radiation from the plasma <b>focus</b> <b>device</b> have been investigated. The design concept and the technical details are described. Design and fabrication of the required diagnostic instruments used to monitor the emitted charged particles and x-rays radiations are presented. The effects of working gas on pinching regimes of the device and generation of charged particle and x-ray radiation have been investigated. Hydrogen, nitrogen, and argon {{have been used as}} working gases. The energy spectra of the ions generated in three operating gases depend on the capacitor bank voltage and the effective charge of the ions. The duration of the current drop and the injected energy into the plasma increases significantly in the high-z gases such as argon. Based on discharge circuit analysis of the device it has been found that the plasma resistance reaches 0. 2 ohm during the post pinch phase in argon plasma and this anomalous resistance causes significant energy consumption during this phase. It has also been found that the anomalous Joule heating during the post pinch phase enhances the production rate of the runaway charged particles due to reduced Dreicer field. It has been found that the runaway electron generation conditions in tokamaks and plasma <b>focus</b> <b>devices</b> are consistent in terms of the ratio of the electric field across the plasma to the electron plasma density. To enhance the efficiency of plasma <b>focus</b> <b>device</b> as a charged particle source, a new configuration of a dense plasma <b>focus</b> <b>device</b> with three electrodes has been designed and tested. The preliminary experimental results have demonstrated that the new device can produce several focusing events in a plasma <b>focus</b> <b>device.</b> The ion beam emission and hard x-ray radiation pulses last longer than that is expected in a conventional plasma focus and their intensities are also higher...|$|R

40|$|A {{large number}} of {{experimental}} investigations {{have been carried out}} on plasma <b>focus</b> <b>devices</b> especially at low energy level of several kJ or over 100 kJ. There are few machines operating in the middle energy range of 10 – 50 kJ, where the neutron yield typically in the order of 108 – 109 per shot. This paper reviews the optimisation process of two different plasma <b>focus</b> <b>devices</b> (12 kJ) by applying the Lee model code. The neutron yield (Yn) versus pressure (P) curve for several configurations of the two plasma focus provided insight of geometrical optimisation. Measured discharge current is fitted as the first step of modelling to correctly simulate the plasma dynamics. Subsequently the code is used to simulate the neutron yield of the two plasma <b>focus</b> <b>devices</b> based on beam target mechanism. Good agreement between the computed results of neutron yield versus pressure and the measured yield versus pressure is found up to the pressure where highest neutron yield is obtained. Computed highest neutron yield for most of the configuration typically differ by a factor < 2...|$|R
50|$|A flow <b>focusing</b> <b>device</b> {{consists}} of a pressure chamber pressurized with a continuous focusing fluid supply. Inside, one or more focused fluids are injected through a capillary feed tube whose extremity opens {{up in front of}} a small orifice linking the pressure chamber with the exterior ambient. The focusing fluid stream moulds the fluid meniscus into a cusp giving rise to a steady micro or nano-jet exiting the chamber through the orifice; the jet size is much smaller than the exit orifice, thus precluding any contact (which may lead to unwanted deposition or reaction). Capillary instability breaks up the steady jet into homogeneous droplets or bubbles.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{advantages}} of using a Nipkow disk is that the image sensor (that is, the device converting light to electric signals) {{can be as simple as}} a single photocell or photodiode, since at each instant only a very small area (a pixel) is visible through the disk (and viewport), and so decomposing an image into lines is done almost by itself with little need for scanline timing, and very high scanline resolution. A simple acquisition device can be built by using an electrical motor driving a Nipkow disk, a small box containing a single light-sensitive (electric) element and a conventional image <b>focusing</b> <b>device</b> (lens, dark box, etc.).|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} damage a booster, it is {{estimated}} that about 3 kJ/C&sup2; would need to hit the airframe. The laser is essentially a <b>focusing</b> <b>device,</b> taking radiation from the length of the rod and turning some small amount of that into a beam. One can consider the effect as increasing the brightness of the x-rays falling on the target compared to the x-rays released by the bomb itself. The enhancement of the brightness compared to the unfocused output from the bomb is , where [...] is the efficiency of conversion from bomb x-rays to laser x-rays, and [...] is the dispersion angle. Estimates of [...] vary from about 10−5 to 10−2; that is, they have laser gain less than one.|$|E

The operation of plasma focus in different pressure regime gives a consistent ion beam properties which can make the plasma focus a reliable ion beam source.

The tip of the central titanium electrode is found to develop at least a few tens of microcuries of tritium after several plasma focus discharges. Neither the tritium impurity level in the deuterium gas used in the experiment nor the tritium branch of the d-d reactions that are known to occur in plasma <b>focus</b> <b>devices</b> can account for such activity in the electrode. Anomalous nuclear reactions in the deuterated titanium lattice appear to be the most probable source of this high activity...|$|R
50|$|Because reverse salients {{limit system}} {{development}}, the {{further development of}} the system lies in the correction of the reverse salient, where correction is attained through incremental or radical innovations. The reverse salient denotes a <b>focusing</b> <b>device,</b> {{in the words of}} Nathan Rosenberg, for technological system stakeholders, which strive to remove it through innovation. It is possible that the reverse salient is not able to be corrected within the bounds of the existing technological system through incremental innovations. Consequently, radical innovations may be needed to correct the reverse salient. However, radical innovations can lead to the creation of new and different technological systems, as witnessed in the emergence of the alternating current system that overcame the problem of low cost electricity distribution, which the direct current system could not.|$|E
50|$|An aerobeacon {{is a light}} {{assembly}} {{used to create a}} fixed or flashing signal visible over long distances. It consists of a high intensity electric lamp mounted with a <b>focusing</b> <b>device</b> in a cylindrical housing, which usually is rotated on a vertical axis with an electric motor. The sweep of the narrow beam thus produced gives the flashing effect. Aerobeacons were originally developed for aviation use, most familiarly as aerodrome beacons, but they also saw extensive use in lighthouses. They were far cheaper to manufacture and maintain than classic glass Fresnel lenses, and more rugged; and they could be mounted exposed to the weather. Historic models include the DCB-24, which used a single parabolic reflector; the DCB-224, a double-beamed version of the DCB-24; and the DCB-36, which used a system of plastic Fresnel lenses. Manufacturers included Carlisle & Finch and the Crouse-Hinds Company. They are still in widespread use.|$|E
50|$|Planar {{media can}} be {{implemented}} with an effective negative refractive index. The underlying concept is based on appropriately loading a printed network of transmission lines periodically with inductors and capacitors. This technique results in effective permittivity and permeability material parameters that are both inherently and simultaneously negative, obviating the need to employ separate means. The proposed media possess other desirable features including very wide bandwidth over which the refractive index remains negative, the ability to guide 2-D TM waves, scalability from RF to millimeter-wave frequencies and low transmission losses, {{as well as the}} potential for tunability by inserting varactors and/or switches in the unit cell. The concept has been verified with circuit and full-wave simulations. A prototype <b>focusing</b> <b>device</b> has been tested experimentally. The experimental results demonstrated focusing of an incident cylindrical wave within an octave bandwidth and over an electrically short area; suggestive of near-field focusing.|$|E

50|$|Acoustic {{tweezers}} {{have been}} developed to achieve 3D focusing of cells/particles in microfluidics. A schematic of the standing surface acoustic wave (SSAW) <b>focusing</b> <b>device</b> is shown in Fig. 5. A pair of interdigital transducers (IDTs) are deposited on a piezoelectric substrate, and a microfluidic channel is bonded with the substrate and positioned between the two IDTs. Microparticle solutions are infused into the microfluidic channel by a pressure-driven flow. Once an RF signal is applied to both IDTs, two series of surface acoustic waves (SAW) propagate in opposite directions toward the particle suspension solution inside the microchannel. The constructive interference of the two SAWs results in the formation of a SSAW, as well as the periodic distribution of the pressure nodes (minimum pressure amplitude) and anti-nodes (maximum pressure amplitude) on the substrate. When the SSAW encounter the liquid medium inside the channel, leakage waves in the longitudinal mode are generated, causing pressure fluctuations in the medium. These pressure fluctuations result in acoustic radiation forces that act laterally (in the x-direction of Fig. 8) on the particles. As a result, the suspended particles inside the channel will be forced toward either the pressure nodes or antinodes, depending on the density and compressibility of the particles and the medium. When the channel width covers only one pressure node (or antinode), the particles will be trapped in that node and consequently, focusing is achieved.|$|E
