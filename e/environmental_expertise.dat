[...] EFI excels in carrying out projects at the European level, and has a track record of over 30 projects carried out for the European Commission DGs during the past few years. EFI puts increasing emphasis on cross-sectoral approaches in its research and development activities. It is thus in a good position to have efficient access to social, economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>expertise</b> covering all of Europe’s bio-geographical regions. The work in the field of policy support includes enhanced support for decision takers and policy makers. For example, the high-level forum on forests, ThinkForest, brings together high-level policy makers and leading European forest scientists to generate science-policy dialogue on strategic forest-related issues. EFI is quickly becoming a leading science-policy platform providing forest-related knowledge to build a sustainable future: connecting knowledge to action.|$|E

[...] NALMS asked {{the federal government to}} reconsider. [...] "The Experimental Lakes Area (ELA) is a rare resource not only in Canada but throughout the world, as a dedicated research facility for ecosystem-scale experimental investigations and long-term monitoring of ecosystem processes. Operating for more than 40 years, it continues to study physical, chemical and biological processes and interactions operating on an ecosystem spatial scale and a multi-year time frame. These have led to extremely important discoveries. As an example, the world’s fertilizer industry now recognizes the importance of phosphorus in lakes and reservoirs, 40 years after its importance was demonstrated at ELA. Regulatory actions have been supported by ELA research, and now there is action by the industry as a result of research and activities at ELA over several decades. The experience gained at ELA by many scientists has resulted in the dissemination of <b>environmental</b> <b>expertise</b> and problem solving throughout the world, improving human conditions, protecting the environment, and saving millions of dollars for citizens and government agencies. Furthermore, we consider the work now in progress at ELA very important to the future of lake and reservoir management." ...|$|E

40|$|Although {{it emerged}} in the United States, the {{endocrine}} disruptors (ED) paradigm quickly became an international reference. This process remains poorly understood. This paper analyzes the simultaneous movements of generalization and localization, which grounded this internationalization. Focusing on {{the early stages of}} the French trajectory of ED and taking the United States as comparative configuration, the paper situates this trajectory within the longer history of environmental health. The events analyzed are those taking place before 2007, which means before the late 2000 s when ED became targets of public controversies as an effect of the debates on Bisphenol A and of the increasing mobilization of an heterogeneous network of non-governmental organizations active in the field of environmental health. The paper challenges the received idea that medical experts interested in issues of male infertility were the sole actors in the introduction of the ED paradigm in France. It also demonstrates that, in contrast to the highly polarized US configuration, the first and publicly invisible phase of appropriation and framing of the problem was rooted in a local regime of <b>environmental</b> health <b>expertise,</b> which focused on close collaborations between academic researchers, the state and the industry...|$|R

The utilization of geotechnologies as a source of data used for <b>environmental</b> <b>expertise</b> constitutes an important tool of precision and reliability to be used in environmental evaluation. The present case aimed to assess if the filling of the reservoir of the hydroelectric plant caused damage to the rural property located at its margins through the utilization of cartographic data and remote sensing associated with the geographic information system. The altimetric quotas were identified and delimited, it was observed that the fence that delimits the farm is located at the quota of 330 meters, therefore above of the maximum maximorum quota of 328. 40 meters, and the filling of the reservoir caused the erosion process called "margin erosion" until the quota of 330 meters. This erosion process was accelerated due to the abrupt changes of slope classes of the grounds and the action of waves formed due the action of the predominant wind in the east-southeast quadrant that resulted in the weakening of the edges of the reservoir.

40|$|ABSTRACT: People's {{behavior}} {{shapes and}} {{is shaped by}} how environmental issues are managed. As a result, {{there may be a}} role for psychologists in various environmental issues. This role offers opportunities to increase the influence and sophistication of our science. However, it also poses risks for both the science and the public. These potentials and pitfalls are discussed here in the context of examples drawn from setting policy for the levels of risk associated with environmentally hazardous technologies. Psychologists are needed by public policymakers whenever the outcomes of their policies either affect or depend on human behavior (Noll, 1985; Stokols & Altman, 1987). For example, in the context of <b>environmental</b> policy, psychological <b>expertise</b> is needed to (a) determine what people value in outdoors experiences (e. g., as an aid to designin...|$|R
