40|$|Saucer-shaped {{dolerite}} sills {{have been}} identified in several sedimentary basins. They are characteristically sub-circular in plan, with an inner sill connected to a steeply inclined arcuate sheet extending upwards {{from the edge of the}} inner sill, and in some cases have raggedly developed flat outer rims. By applying elastic plate theory to the overburden, we obtain an expression for the maximum radius of a circular sill in terms of emplacement depth, excess magma pressure, elastic constants of the overburden and the tensile strain at failure. This expression predicts that the radius of the flat base of a saucer-shaped sill increases with emplacement depth, as observed in the western Karoo Basin, South Africa. Some saucer-shaped sills display an elliptical morphology. From consideration of the <b>flexural</b> <b>strains</b> around the periphery of a horizontal elliptical sill, we infer that saucer-shaped elliptical sills have been fed from below by feeder dykes oriented along the major axis of the ellipse.

30|$|The {{technology}} of continuously welded rails (CWRs) {{is important in}} modern railway track structures. To measure rail stress, resistance strain gauges are preferred due to their good stability, sensitivity, and resistance to external interference. Based on the bi-directional strain method, we present a new method for measuring longitudinal rail stress using resistance strain gauges and develop a monitoring device for rail stress to realize long-term and multi-point measurement. Also relevant experimental verification and analysis are conducted. Results indicate that under various constraints the rail stress–strain values can be calculated just with the measured total longitudinal strain and total vertical strain. Considering the measurement error caused by sectional feature of sensors, we put forward a correction equation applicable to different stress conditions. Although the temperature values of the four full-bridge stress gauges can offset each other, the measurement error caused by rail <b>flexural</b> <b>strain</b> can also be eliminated {{to a certain extent}} at the same time, the non-uniform distribution of rail cross section temperature and unbalanced <b>flexural</b> <b>strain</b> still affect the measurement error.

Three compositions of core with different carbon fibre/glass fibre weight ratios (23 / 77, 47 / 53, and 100 / 0) were studied to find out the optimum composition for both strain sensitivity and mechanical performance.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental and numerical {{investigation into the}} effect of reinforcement exposure during the patch repair process on the ultimate strength of continuous beams. The parameters investigated were the position of breakout within the member and the areas of flexural reinforcement at the intermediate support and within the span. Reinforcement layouts were designed to vary both the moment redistribution demand for the full plastic collapse load to be attained and the redistribution capacity at the location where the first hinge would form. Exposure of reinforcement and the consequent loss of bond has two major effects. Firstly, it reduces beam stiffness at the exposed location, and shifts the balance of moments away from the location at which bars are exposed {{to other parts of}} the beam, Secondly, loss of composite interaction alters the pattern of <b>flexural</b> <b>strains</b> at the exposed section, increasing the strain at the extreme compression fibre and reducing section ductility.

It was found that the morphology of the green hollow fibre to a large extent predetermines the final morphology of the sintered hollow fibre. There is a set of conditions which produce hollow fibres with high mechanical strength over 1000 MPa such as using small SS particles (6 and 10 μm), PEI as the polymeric binder and minimal amounts of the viscosity modifier PVP (preferably close to 0 wt%), particle loadings higher than 50 wt%, and sintering temperatures between 1050 and 1100 °C. The ductility of the hollow fibres was not greatly affected by these parameters as <b>flexural</b> <b>strain</b> variations were very small, though sintering in argon resulted in the formation of a few larger pores which tended to propagate cracks, leading to lower <b>flexural</b> <b>strain.</b> The sintering process in inert gases resulted in mass transfer of residual carbon from the binder to the SS particle, leading to regions of rich and lean chromium carbides, though mechanical effects of these inclusions were not significant.
