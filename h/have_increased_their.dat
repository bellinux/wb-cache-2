5|$|Whales {{were once}} {{uncommon}} in the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea, but <b>have</b> <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> presence in both waters as global populations have recovered. Recent increases within the Mediterranean basin, including re-sightings, indicate that more whales may migrate into the inland sea in the future, {{not only for}} wintering but also for feeding. Humpbacks are also showing signs of re-expanding into former ranges, such as Scotland, Skagerrak and Kattegat, as well as Scandinavian fjords such as Kvænangen, where {{they had not been}} observed for decades.|$|E
5|$|While {{many species}} of pigeons and doves have benefited from human {{activities}} and <b>have</b> <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction. Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) {{are two of the}} most famous extinct species, the dodo and the passenger pigeon.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{range of}} any species {{is that of}} the rock dove. This species had a large natural {{distribution}} from Britain and Ireland to northern Africa, across Europe, Arabia, Central Asia, India, the Himalayas and up into China and Mongolia. The range of the species increased dramatically upon domestication, as the species went feral in cities around the world. The species is currently resident across most of North America, and has established itself in cities and urban areas in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. The species is not the only pigeon to have increased its range due to the actions of man; several other species have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity, and other species <b>have</b> <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity.|$|E

5|$|As {{marine mammal}} species often play {{a large part}} in their ecosystems, it is {{possible}} that the sea mink was an important intertidal predator. It may have had a similar diet to the American mink, and may have consumed seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Fur traders reported that sea mink dens had two entrances, and were made in the rocks piled up by the waves. Remains of toad sculpins and ocean pout were the most common around their dens, and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet. Their seafood-oriented diet may <b>have</b> <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> size. According to fur traders, the sea mink was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. Due to the overlap of American mink and sea mink ranges, {{it is possible that}} they hybridized with each other. Although not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of Musteloidea, being, next to otters, the most aquatic member of the taxon.|$|E

25|$|Traditional manmade {{threats to}} macaques have been slash-and-burn agriculture, use of forest woods for {{construction}} and fuel, and hunting.

25|$|Many {{credit card}} {{customers}} receive rewards, such as frequent flyer points, gift certificates, or cash back {{as an incentive}} to use the card. Rewards are generally tied to purchasing an item or service on the card, {{which may or may}} not include balance transfers, cash advances, or other special uses. Depending on the type of card, rewards will generally cost the issuer between 0.25% and 2.0% of the spread. Networks such as Visa or MasterCard <b>have</b> <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> fees to allow issuers to fund their rewards system. Some issuers discourage redemption by forcing the cardholder to call customer service for rewards. On their servicing website, redeeming awards is usually a feature that is very well hidden by the issuers. With a fractured and competitive environment, rewards points cut dramatically into an issuer's bottom line, and rewards points and related incentives must be carefully managed to ensure a profitable portfolio. Unlike unused gift cards, in whose case the breakage in certain US states goes to the state's treasury, unredeemed credit card points are retained by the issuer.|$|E
