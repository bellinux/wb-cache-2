The possible displacement content of fly ash in <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> was investigated in this paper. The effect of various chemicals retarders, such as Citric acid, sodium citrate and SC gypsum retarder, and water retention agent on the setting time, flexural strength and compressive strength of <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> was also studied. The results demonstrate that <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> has maximum mechanical properties and enough setting time at the rate of 20 % fly ash replacing calcined gypsum; SC gypsum retarder effectively delays the setting time and has lower strength loss; The optimum level of water-retention agent for effective utilization of <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> is 0. 2 %...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of porosity for {{the properties of}} hardened <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> products. The porosity of the plaster matrix plays a central part in the mechanical properties of <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> building components. It correlates with the various properties (ME) through {{a function of the}} type: n ME =(1 -p) for n = 2, 5 [...] . 3, 5 in wich K is a material constant for the pore-free state (p = 0). Normal commercial <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> building components wich are made from -hemihydrate binders habe porosities between 0, 45 and 0, 55. The corresponding property values can be improved by a factor of more than 3 by halving the porosity. However, practical implementation of these results requires different production processes which will allow the water/plaster ratio to be lowered to values around 0, 3. Water/plaster ratios of < 0, 25 have already been achieved on an experimental basis. For the same porosity <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> products made from a- and -hemihydrate have practically the same mechanical properties...|$|R

The content of silica and cristobalite reduces dimensional variations of setted <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> what increases dimensional accuracy and significant stresses reduction limiting the possibility of mould cracks occurrence during heating. The influence of cristobalite and silica addition on basic <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> properties like setting time, dimensional changes after setting, bending strength and permeability in raw and heat treated state are presented in this paper.

Around 7500 BC, the people of 'Ain Ghazal in Jordan used lime mixed with unheated crushed limestone to make plaster which was used {{on a large scale}} for covering walls, floors, and hearths in their houses. Often, walls and floors were decorated with red, finger-painted patterns and designs. In ancient India and China, renders in clay and <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasters</b> were used to produce a smooth surface over rough stone or mud brick walls, while in early Egyptian tombs, walls were coated with lime and <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> and the finished surface was often painted or decorated.|$|R

40|$|International audienceSulphate {{neoformation}} is a {{major factor}} of degradation of stone monuments. Boron, sulphur and oxygen isotope signatures were investigated for five French historical monuments (Bourges, Chartres and Marseille cathedrals, Chenonceau castle, and Versailles garden statues) to investigate the role of intrinsic sulphate sources (<b>gypsum</b> <b>plasters</b> and mortars) in stone degradation, compared to the influence of extrinsic sources such as atmospheric pollution. <b>Gypsum</b> <b>plasters</b> and gypsum-containing mortars fall systematically in the δ 34 S and δ 18 O range of Paris Basin Eocene evaporites indicating the origin of the raw materials (so-called "Paris plaster"). Black crusts show the typical S and O isotope signatures observed elsewhere in Europe that can be attributed to atmospheric pollution, together with a marine component for Marseille. Boron isotopes for black crusts indicate coal combustion as principal boron source. Mortar isotope compositions discriminate three types, one similar to <b>gypsum</b> <b>plasters,</b> one strongly depleted in 34 S, attributed to pyrite oxidation, and a third one close to atmospheric sulphates. The isotopic composition of sulphates and boron of most degraded building stones of the different monuments is well explained by the identified sulphate sources. In several cases (in particular for Chenonceau and Bourges, to some extent for Chartres), the impact of <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> as building and restoration material on the degradation of the stones in its vicinity was clearly demonstrated. The study illustrates the usefulness of multi-isotope studies to investigate stone degradation factors, as the combination of several isotope systematics increases the discriminatory power of isotope studies with respect to contaminant sources...|$|R
5000|$|A gypsum {{block is}} made of <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> and water. The {{manufacturing}} process [...] is automated at production plants where raw gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) is ground and dried, then heated to remove three-quarters of the bound water and thus transformed into calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO4·½H2O), also known as <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster,</b> stucco, calcined <b>gypsum</b> or <b>plaster</b> of Paris. This process is also called calcination. The plaster is then mixed with water, stirred and poured into molds to form gypsum blocks with standard formats, either solid, or with round or square open cores to reduce weight and conserve materials. Each block is moulded with tongue and groove at all sides, to enable quick and easy assembly. Still wet, the gypsum blocks are {{taken out of the}} molds and put into drying chambers.

40|$|Published {{test reports}} on the sound {{insulation}} of <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> board cavity stud walls with viscoelastic glue sandwiched between two layers of <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> board working as a constrained layer damper show large increases in sound insulation compared to the sound insulation of the same wall without the viscoelastic material. An increase in the sound insulation would be expected above the critical frequency of the <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> board panels and {{in the vicinity of}} the mass-air-mass resonant frequency due to the increased damping. However the test results show significant increases at other frequencies as well. A critical examination of the theory shows that the sound transmission via the air in the wall cavity is not expected to be greatly affected by the damping at these other frequencies. On the other hand, the sound transmission via the studs is affected at all frequencies by the damping. Hence it is not surprising that the published results are all for cavity stud walls. The sound insulation of two 16 mm thick <b>gypsum</b> <b>plaster</b> board sheets was measured. The sheets were mounted touching each other in three different configurations. These were without glue in between, bonded together with viscoelastic glue and spot bonded together with standard commercial glue. Surprisingly the elastic material compound gave better results even below the critical frequency, although the improvement became smaller and then disappeared as the frequency was decreased. A cavity stud wall with the second and third of the above configurations on each side of the studs was also tested. Again the viscoelastic glue performed better than the standard commercial glue, but the viscoelastic results were less than the original published results. Further published results were found which were in between the original published results and the experimental results obtained by the authors of this paper...|$|R

These reactions strongly influence the temperature dependence of the mentioned properties which in turn affect the response of the material to fire. Based on these experimental results the thermal reaction of a gypsum-protected steel column in fire is modeled for the four types of gypsum.
