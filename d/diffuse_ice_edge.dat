In conjunction with SAR imagery collected by the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, the research vessel Hakon Mosby recorded meteorological data on station near the <b>ice</b> <b>edge.</b> The marginal <b>ice</b> zone was subjected to atmospheric and oceanographic forcing during the 7 - 16 January period which resulted in significant changes in <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> morphology. As intense low pressure systems propagated across the Greenland Sea, strong easterly and northerly winds dominated oceanographic forcing and created a compact <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> which correlated with the 50 % ice concentration isopleth from the SSM/I passive microwave sensor.

40|$|A novel method {{based on}} the curvelet {{transform}} and active contour method to automatically detect the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is proposed. The method utilizes the location of high curvelet coefficients to determine regions in the image likely to contain the <b>ice</b> <b>edge.</b> Using an <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> from passive microwave sea ice concentration for initialization, these regions are then joined using the active contour method to obtain the final <b>ice</b> <b>edge.</b> The method is evaluated on four dual polarization SAR scenes of the Labrador sea. Through comparison of the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> with that from image analysis charts, it is demonstrated that the proposed method can detect the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> effectively in SAR images. This is particularly relevant when the marginal <b>ice</b> zone is <b>diffuse</b> or the <b>ice</b> is thin, and using the definition of <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> from the passive microwave ice concentration would underestimate the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> location. It is expected that the method may be useful for operations in marginal ice zones, such as offshore drilling, where a high resolution estimate of the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> location is required.

The processes controlling {{the distribution of}} melt water from the retreating <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> in summer in the Chukchi Sea were examined {{in order to provide}} evidence of the flow regime. Current and salinity data from the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) files and from four MIZPAC cruises were utilized in this work. An increase in melt-water content towards the ice in the approximately 30 km wide icemelt zone as well as an abrupt salinity decrease were observed.

40|$|ABSTRACT. In 1979, 17 {{species of}} birds were seen during studies near the Pond Inlet <b>ice</b> <b>edge.</b> Northern fulmars (Fulmurus glacialis), black-legged {{kittiwake}}s (Rissu triductylu), thick-billed murres (Uriu Zomvia), and black guillemots (Cepphus grylle) all avoided the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> when bordered with heavy pack ice and all but kittiwake used the ice dge primarily for feeding. Guillemots and fulmars occurred in highest numbers in water along rough and moderately rough landfast ice; murres and kittiwakes showed no preference for such areas or for the other habitat surveyed (smooth landfast ice). Narwhals (Monodon monoceros), white whales (Delphinapterus leltcas), and ringed seals (Phoca hispidu) were the only marine mammals common at the <b>ice</b> <b>edge.</b> Whales repeatedly dived under the edge- probably feeding, searching for open water west of the <b>ice</b> <b>edge,</b> or both. Densities of seals near the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> were higher than elsewhere on landfast ice. Divers observed arctic cod (Eoreogadus suidu) close to the undersurface of landfast ice. Fish offshore were generally smaller, younger, and smaller-at-age than those inshore. Offshore, arctic cod were more numerous in areas with a rough under-ice surface than under smooth ice. Cod concentrated in crevices within rough under-ice surfaces. Inshore, cod were captured from ice cracks over shallow water. I conclude that vertebrates occur at <b>ice</b> <b>edges</b> for {{one or more of}} several reasons. Ringed seals and arctic cod live in close association with landfast ice; they probably occur near <b>ice</b> <b>edges</b> simply because landfast ice is present there. <b>Ice</b> <b>edges</b> seem to be primarily barriers against the further movements of whales toward summering locations.

40|$|The Marginal sea Ice Zone (MIZ) {{and the sea}} <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> are {{the most}} dynamic areas of the sea ice cover. Knowledge of the sea <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> {{location}} is vital for routing shipping in the polar regions. The <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> is the location of recurrent plankton blooms, and is the habitat {{for a number of}} animals, including several which are under severe ecological threat. Polar lows are known to preferentially form along the sea <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> because of induced atmospheric baroclinicity, and the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> is also the location of both vertical and horizontal ocean currents driven by thermal and salinity gradients. Finally, sea ice is both a driver and indicator of climate change and monitoring the position of the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> accurately over long time periods enables assessment of the impact of global and regional warming near the poles. Several sensors are currently in orbit that can monitor the sea <b>ice</b> <b>edge.</b> These sensors, though, have different spatial resolutions, different limitations, and different repeat frequencies. Satellite passive microwave sensors can monitor the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> on a daily or even twice-daily basis, albeit with low spatial resolution - 25 km for the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) or 12. 5 km for the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). Although special methods exist that allow the detection of the sea <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> at a quarter of that nominal resolution (PSSM). Visible and infrared data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provide daily coverage at 1 km and 250 m, respectively, but the surface observations me limited to cloud-free periods. The Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) has a resolution of 15 to 30 m but is limited to cloud-free periods as well, and does not provide daily coverage. Imagery from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instruments has resolutions of tens of meters to 100 m, and can be used to distinguish open water and sea ice on the basis of surface and volume scattering characteristics. The Canadian RADARSAT C-band SAR provides data that cover the Arctic Ocean and the MIZ every 3 days. A change-point detection approach was utilized to obtain an <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> estimate from the RADARSAT data The Quickscat scatterometer provides <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> information with a resolution of a few kilometers on a near-daily basis. During portions of March and April of 2003 a series of aircraft flights were conducted over the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> in the Bering Sea carrying the Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR), which provides spectral coverage identical with the AMSR-E instrument at a resolution of 500 meters. In this study we investigated these different data sets and analyzed differences in their definition of the sea <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> and the marginal ice zone and how these differences as well as their individual limitations affect the monitoring of the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> dynamics. We also examined how the nature of the sea <b>ice</b> <b>edge,</b> including its location, compactness and shape, changes over the seasons.

40|$|Abstract. A coupled {{global climate}} model {{is used to}} {{evaluate}} processes that determine the equilibrium location of the sea-ice edge and its climatological annual cycle. The {{extent to which the}} wintertime <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> departs from a symmetric ring around either pole depends primarily on coastlines, ice motion, and the melt rate at the ice-ocean interface. At any location the principal drivers of the oceanic heat flux that melts sea ice are absorbed solar radiation and the convergence of heat transported by ocean currents. The distance between the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> and the pole and the magnitude of the ocean heat flux convergence at the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> are inversely related. The chief exception to this rule is in the East Greenland Current, where the ocean heat flux convergence just east of the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> is relatively high but ice survives due to its swift southward motion and the protection of the cold southward flowing surface water. In regions where the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> extends relatively far equator-ward, absorbed solar radiation is the largest component of the ocean energy budget, and the large seasonal range of insolation causes the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> to traverse a large distance. In contrast at relatively high latitudes, the ocean heat flux convergence is the largest component and it has a relatively small annual range, so the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> traverses a much smaller distance there. When the model is subject to increased CO 2 forcing up to twice pre-industrial levels, the ocean heat flux convergence weakens near the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> in most places. This weakening reduces the heat flux from the ocean {{to the base of the}} ice and tends to offset the effects of increased radiative forcing at the ice surface, so the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> retreats less than it would otherwise. 1...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} research was to develop a coupled sea ice-ocean model capable of simulating the upper ocean circulation features of the Marginal Ice Zone (MIZ). A sea ice model using the Rossby-similarity method was added to a two-dimensional, embedded ocean general circulation— mixed layer model. Advection, diffusion, and mixing of buoyancy and momentum were included in the model to determine their effects on the ocean response. In particular, the case of Northern Hemisphere <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> upwelling was investigated. <b>Ice</b> <b>edge</b> upwelling was created for a down-ice geostrophic wind and varying surface buoyancy flux forcing. It appeared in model solutions for both stationary and moving ice covers and is driven by a divergence in the oceanic surface transport across the <b>ice</b> <b>edge.</b> These results are supported by the observations of the NORSEX group in the Greenland Sea MIZ (Johannessen et. al. 1983). For an up-ice geostrophic wind, the upper ocean response was modified by the buoyancy forcing and ice motion. The combined effects of the wind forcing and ice motion due to a nonstationary ice cover caused weak downwelling at the <b>ice</b> <b>edge.</b> Application of a downward surface buoyancy flux (simulating ice melting) resulted in a 8 m elevation of the mixed layer depth at the <b>ice</b> <b>edge,</b> or upwelling, next to the downwelling.

40|$|Analysis of {{ice sheet}} failure due to {{indentor}} contact at the <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> is presented. The indentor is flat, with an angle a varying about an axis {{parallel to the}} <b>ice</b> <b>edge.</b> Two indentors, which make simultaneous contact, are also considered. The stress distribution in the ice sheet due to the applied forces is calculated, and the ice sheet failure is studied by applying a suitable ice failure criterion.

The <b>Ice</b> <b>Edge</b> bid, while planning to keep the team in Phoenix, also proposed to play five Coyotes home games in Saskatoon each season as part of a five-year plan to return the Coyotes to profitability.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Antarctic sea {{ice cover}} plays an {{important}} role in shaping the earth’s climate, primarily by insulating the ocean from the atmosphere and increasing the surface albedo. The convective processes accompanied with the sea ice formation result bottom water formation. The cold and dense bottom water moves towards the equator along the ocean basins and takes part in the global thermohaline circulation. Sea <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> is a potential indicator of climate change. Additionally, fishing and commercial shipping activities as well as military submarine operations in the polar seas need reliable <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> information. However, as the sea <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> is unstable in time, the temporal validity of the estimated <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> is often shorter than the time required to transfer the information to the operational user. Hence, an accurate sea <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> prediction as well as determination is crucial for fine-scale geophysical modeling and for near-real-time operations. In this study, active contour modelling (known as Snake model) and non-rigid motion estimation techniques have been used for predicting the sea <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> (SIE) in the Antarctic. For this purpose the SIE has been detected from sea ice concentration derived using special sensor microwave imager (SSM/I) observations. The 15 % sea ice concentration pixels are being taken as the <b>edge</b> pixel between <b>ice</b> and water. The external force, gradient vector flow (GVF), of SIE for total the Antarctic region is parameterised for daily as well as weekly data set. The SIE is predicted at certain points using a statistical technique. These predicted points have been used to constitute a SIE using artificial intelligence technique, the gradient vector flow (GVF). The predicted edge has been validated with that of SSM/I. It is found that all the major curvatures have been captured by the predicated edge and it is in good agreement with that of the SSM/I observation...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the improvement in}} <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> error within the US Navy's operational sea ice forecast systems gained by assimilating high horizontal resolution satellite-derived ice concentration products. Since the late 1980 's, the ice forecast systems have assimilated near real-time sea ice concentration derived from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSMI and then SSMIS). The resolution of the satellite-derived product was approximately {{the same as the}} previous operational ice forecast system (25 km). As the sea ice forecast model resolution increased over time, the need for higher horizontal resolution observational data grew. In 2013, a new Navy sea ice forecast system (Arctic Cap Nowcast/Forecast System – ACNFS) went into operations with a horizontal resolution of ~ 3. 5 km at the North Pole. A method of blending ice concentration observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR 2) along with a sea ice mask produced by the National Ice Center (NIC) has been developed, resulting in an ice concentration product with very high spatial resolution. In this study, ACNFS was initialized with this newly developed high resolution blended ice concentration product. The daily <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> locations from model hindcast simulations were compared against independent observed <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> locations. ACNFS initialized using the high resolution blended ice concentration data product decreased predicted <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> location error compared to the operational system that only assimilated SSMIS data. A second evaluation assimilating the new blended sea ice concentration product into the pre-operational Navy Global Ocean Forecast System 3. 1 also showed a substantial improvement in <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> location over a system using the SSMIS sea ice concentration product alone. This paper describes the technique used to create the blended sea ice concentration product and the significant improvements in <b>ice</b> <b>edge</b> forecasting in both of the Navy's sea ice forecasting systems...|$|R
