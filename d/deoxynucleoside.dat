25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The <b>deoxynucleoside</b> analogues include cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|Anti-metabolites are a {{group of}} {{molecules}} that impede DNA and RNA synthesis. Many {{of them have a}} similar structure to the building blocks of DNA and RNA. The building blocks are nucleotides; a molecule comprising a nucleobase, a sugar and a phosphate group. The nucleobases are divided into purines (guanine and adenine) and pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine and uracil). Anti-metabolites resemble either nucleobases or nucleosides (a nucleotide without the phosphate group), but have altered chemical groups. These drugs exert their effect by either blocking the enzymes required for DNA synthesis or becoming incorporated into DNA or RNA. By inhibiting the enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, they prevent mitosis because the DNA cannot duplicate itself. Also, after misincorporation of the molecules into DNA, DNA damage can occur and programmed cell death (apoptosis) is induced. Unlike alkylating agents, anti-metabolites are cell cycle dependent. This means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle, in this case S-phase (the DNA synthesis phase). For this reason, at a certain dose, the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses. Subtypes of the anti-metabolites are the anti-folates, fluoropyrimidines, <b>deoxynucleoside</b> analogues and thiopurines.|$|E

Influence of {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} {{degradation}} products and orthophosphate on deoxynucleotide kinase activity and deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in pneumococcus type III. J.

High levels of orthophosphate can produce similar effects. For part of the incubation period, the activity of dCMP and dGMP kinases is very low or undetectable in unsupplemented-cell suspensions of pneumococci. In contrast, the remaining kinases, deoxyadenylic acid and thymidylic acid, which are present in ample amounts in control and supplemented cells throughout the incubation period, are unaffected {{by the addition of}} oligodeoxynucleotides and orthophosphate.

When the oligodeoxynucleotide fraction and orthophosphate are further supplemented with all eight of the naturally occurring <b>deoxynucleosides</b> and deoxynucleotides (which do not affect kinase activity), a preferential enhancement of DNA synthesis occurs in comparison with cell growth or protein synthesis.

40|$|Deoxyadenosine (dAdo) and {{deoxyguanosine}} (dGuo) decrease methionine synthesis from homocysteine in cultured lymphoblasts; {{because of}} the possible trapping of 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate this could lead to decreased purine nucleotide synthesis. Since purine <b>deoxynucleosides</b> could also inhibit purine synthesis de novo at an early step not involving folate metabolism, we measured in azaserine-treated cells 5 -amino- 4 -imidazolecarboxamide (Z-base) -dependent purine nucleotide synthesis using [14 C]formate. In the T lymphoblasts, Z-base-dependent purine nucleotide synthesis was decreased 26 % by 0. 3 microM-dAdo, 21 % by 1 microM-dGuo and 28 % by 1 microM-adenosine dialdehyde, a potent S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase inhibitor; homocysteine fully reversed the inhibitions. The B lymphoblasts were considerably less sensitive to the deoxynucleoside-induced decrease in Z-base-dependent purine nucleotide synthesis, with 100 microM-dAdo required for significant inhibition and no inhibition by dGuo at this concentration; homocysteine partly reversed the inhibition by dAdo. The observed decrease in Z-base-dependent purine nucleotide synthesis could not be attributed either to dUMP depletion changing the folate pools or to decreased ATP availability because dUrd was without effect and during the experimental period the intracellular ATP concentration did not change significantly. Cells with 5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency were relatively resistant to inhibition of Z-base-dependent purine nucleotide synthesis by dAdo and adenosine dialdehyde.

5000|$|Vpx enhances HIV-2 {{replication}} {{in humans}} by counteracting the host factor SAMHD1. [...] SAMHD1 is a host factor found in human myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, that restricts HIV-1 replication by depleting the cytoplasmic pool of <b>deoxynucleoside</b> triphosphates needed for viral DNA production. [...] SAMHD1 does not, however, restrict HIV-2 replication in myeloid cells {{due to the}} presence of viral Vpx. Vpx counteracts restriction by inducing the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of SAMHD1. Vpx-mediated degradation of SAMHD1 therefore decreases <b>deoxynucleoside</b> triphosphate hydrolysis, thereby increasing the availability of dNTPs for viral reverse transcription in the cytoplasm. It has been postulated that SAMHD1 degradation is required for HIV-2 replication because the HIV-2 reverse transcriptase (RT) is less active than the HIV-1 RT, which would be the reason for the absence of Vpx from HIV-1. Because Vpx is required for HIV-2 reverse transcription and {{the early stages of the}} viral life cycle, it is packaged into virions in significant amounts.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOxidized <b>deoxynucleosides</b> {{are widely}} used as {{biomarkers}} for DNA oxidation and oxidative stress assessment. Although gas chromatography mass spectrometry is widely used for the measurement of multiple DNA lesions, this approach requires complex sample preparation contributing to possible artifactual oxidation. To address these issues, a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) -tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed to measure 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyguanosine (8 -OH-dG), 8 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyadenosine (8 -OH-dA), 2 -hydroxy- 2 ′-deoxyadenosine (2 -OH-dA), thymidine glycol (TG), and 5 -hydroxymethyl- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (HMDU) in DNA samples with fast sample preparation. In order to selectively monitor the product ions of these precursors with optimum sensitivity for use during quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis, unique and abundant fragment ions had to be identified during MS/MS with collision-induced dissociation (CID). Positive and negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectra with CID were compared {{for the analysis of}} these five oxidized <b>deoxynucleosides.</b> The most abundant fragment ions were usually formed by cleavage of the glycosidic bond in both positive and negative ion modes. However, in the negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectra of 8 -OH-dG, 2 -OH-dA, and 8 -OH-dA, cleavage of two bonds within the sugar ring produced abundant S 1 type ions with loss of a neutral molecule weighing 90 u, [M − H − 90]−. The signal-to-noise ratio was similar for negative and positive ion electrospray MS/MS except in the case of thymidine glycol where the signal-to-noise was 100 times greater in negative ionization mode. Therefore, negative ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry with CID would be preferred to positive ion mode for the analysis of sets of oxidized <b>deoxynucleosides</b> that include thymidine glycol. Investigation of the fragmentation pathways indicated some new general rules for the fragmentation of negatively charged oxidized nucleosides. When purine nucleosides contain a hydroxyl group in the C 8 position, an S 1 type product ion will dominate the product ions due to a six-membered ring hydrogen transfer process. Finally, a new type of fragment ion formed by elimination of a neutral molecule weighing 48 (CO 2 H 4) from the sugar moiety was observed for all three oxidized purine nucleosides...|$|R
