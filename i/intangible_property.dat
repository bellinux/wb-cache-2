25|$|Until January 1, 2006, Kentucky {{imposed a}} tax on {{intangible}} personal property held by a taxpayer on January 1 of each year. The Kentucky intangible tax was repealed under House Bill 272. <b>Intangible</b> <b>property</b> consisted of any property or investment that represents evidence of value or the right to value. Some types of <b>intangible</b> <b>property</b> included: bonds, notes, retail repurchase agreements, accounts receivable, trusts, enforceable contracts {{sale of real estate}} (land contracts), money in hand, money in safe deposit boxes, annuities, interests in estates, loans to stockholders, and commercial paper.|$|E
25|$|Wisconsin {{does not}} assess {{a tax on}} <b>intangible</b> <b>property.</b> Wisconsin does not collect {{inheritance}} taxes. Until January 1, 2008, Wisconsin's estate tax was decoupled from the federal estate tax laws; therefore the state imposed its own estate tax on certain large estates.|$|E
25|$|Utah {{collects}} {{personal income}} tax; since 2008 the tax {{has been a}} flat 5 percent for all taxpayers. The state sales tax has a base rate of 6.45 percent, with cities and counties levying additional local sales taxes that vary among the municipalities. Property taxes are assessed and collected locally. Utah does not charge <b>intangible</b> <b>property</b> taxes and does not impose an inheritance tax.|$|E

50|$|Compared to Asian peers, the UNESCO listed {{intangible}} {{cultural heritage}} of the Philippines is lacking and underperforming, sparking scholars to push for the need of a Department of Culture and the Arts as the current National Commission for Culture and the Arts is heavily limited in scope. In actual comparison, the Philippines has 3 UNESCO <b>intangible</b> <b>properties,</b> while China has at least 39, Japan has 21, South Korea has 19, Mongolia has 13, India has 12, and neighboring Vietnam to the west has 11. The Philippines formerly had {{the highest number of}} <b>intangible</b> <b>properties</b> in Southeast Asia in 2008, but was immediately taken over by Vietnam and Indonesia on 2009.|$|R
25|$|A fiduciary, {{such as the}} administrator, {{executor}} or {{guardian of}} an estate, may be legally required to file with a probate court or judge a surety bond, called a fiduciary bond or probate bond, to guarantee faithful performance of his duties. One of those duties may be to prepare, generally under oath, an inventory of the tangible or <b>intangible</b> <b>property</b> of the estate, describing the items or classes of property and usually placing a valuation on them.|$|E
25|$|The {{conception}} that {{an action}} for conversion lies only for tangible property {{capable of being}} identified and taken into actual possession {{is based on a}} fiction by which the action of trover was founded, namely, that the defendant had found the property of another, which was lost. This conception has become, in the progress of the law, something without meaning which has been discarded by most courts. Therefore, it has been generally accepted that an action for conversion lies for every species of personal property which is the subject of private ownership, whether animate or inanimate. <b>Intangible</b> <b>property</b> can be the subject of a conversion in the United States. There cannot be an action in conversion for choses in action or mere debt. Computer software can be the subject of a conversion.|$|E
25|$|The Tennessee {{income tax}} {{does not apply}} to {{salaries}} and wages, but most income from stock, bonds and notes receivable is taxable. All taxable dividends and interest which exceed the $1,250 single exemption or the $2,500 joint exemption are taxable at the rate of 6%. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%. Food is taxed at a lower rate of 5.25%, but candy, dietary supplements and prepared food are taxed at the full 7% rate. Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions, at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%, bringing the total sales tax to between 8.5% and 9.75%, one of the highest levels in the nation. <b>Intangible</b> <b>property</b> is assessed on the shares of stock of stockholders of any loan company, investment company, insurance company or for-profit cemetery companies. The assessment ratio is 40% of the value multiplied by the tax rate for the jurisdiction. Tennessee imposes an inheritance tax on decedents' estates that exceed maximum single exemption limits ($1,000,000 for deaths in 2006 and thereafter).|$|E

5000|$|Under the 1950 Law for Protection of Cultural <b>Properties,</b> <b>intangible</b> {{cultural}} <b>properties</b> {{are defined}} as dramatic, musical, artistic, and other intangible cultural artifacts of high value in terms of Japanese history or art (Article 2, Section 1, Part 2).

500|$|This {{is part of}} the [...] "orthodox" [...] or [...] "strict" [...] rule, {{along with}} Re Goldcorp. The {{exception}} to this rule is found in Hunter v Moss, which concerned 50 shares meant to be transferred to an employee out of a total holding of 950. These shares were not individually identified, but Dillon LJ held that this was irrelevant because the shares were all of the same type and in the same company, and so it made no difference which particular shares were transferred. This was applied in Re Harvard Securities, where Neuberger J held that there was a difference between tangible property, such as wine, and <b>intangible</b> <b>property,</b> such as shares. <b>Intangible</b> <b>property,</b> by its very nature, does not require segregation.|$|E
500|$|The {{academic}} {{reaction to}} Hunter was mixed. While some called it [...] "fair, sensible and workable", or noted that [...] "Logically {{the decision in}} Hunter v Moss appears a sensible one", Alastair Hudson felt that [...] "doctrinally, {{it is suggested that}} the decision in Hunter v Moss is wrong and should not be relied upon", because it contradicted existing property law and drew a distinction between tangible and <b>intangible</b> <b>property</b> he felt to be [...] "spurious".|$|E
500|$|Hunter is {{commonly}} cited as {{having said that}} with intangible, identical property, {{it is not necessary}} to segregate the trust and non-trust sections. In fact Dillon LJ never said such a thing, although [...] "it is the obvious conclusion to draw [...] ". He merely distinguished Re London Wine Co, allowing him to decide the case on the facts alone. Hunter was reluctantly applied in Re Harvard Securities, where Neuberger J reluctantly decided that it had said there was no need to segregate <b>intangible</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Araquio Festival is {{a unique}} festivity in form and artistry. This festival is Nueva Ecija's very own theatrical-cum-religious {{presentation}} similar to [...] "zarzuelas" [...] during the Spanish regime in the country. The Araquio Festival is traditionally held {{in the month of}} May in the town of Peñaranda. The festival dramatized the spread of Christianity in the country and the war between Christians and Muslims. Festival performers, 16 performers in each Araquio group, sing, act and dance while a brass band plays. The choice of songs and choreography varies, but the script has remained the same since the tradition started. This festival is listed as a Philippine Intangible Cultural Heritage by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (Philippines); the only national <b>intangible</b> <b>property</b> that is solely from Nueva Ecija.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{a number}} of {{commentators}} have expressed enthusiasm over the increasing [...] "propertization" [...] of intellectual property (that is to say, the increased application of real property doctrines to <b>intangible</b> <b>property)</b> and {{the extension of the}} trespass to chattels doctrine to computer networks, {{a number of}} detractors have expressed concern over the ramifications of extending the theory to protect electronic communications that do not actually damage the computer systems in question but only cause nominal damage due to their content. [...] Primarily, these critics worry that extending trespass to chattels in this fashion would stifle free speech on the internet because any unwelcome email might constitute a trespass and may subject the sender not only to civil liability under the trespass theory but to criminal liability as well. [...] This would presumably reduce people's willingness to communicate freely on the Internet and curtail the Internet's ability to function as an open, democratic forum. Particularly in situations where the electronic communication is an email that contains speech that is of importance to the public and the communications do not hamper the functionality of the recipient's computer system, First Amendment free speech protections ought to outweigh the property right in the unharmed computer system. Similarly, critics have also expressed concerns that plaintiffs have employed the doctrine to stifle legitimate competition. For example, the screen-scraping cases indicate that courts might interpret trespass to chattels {{in such a way that}} allows major corporations to prevent price comparison sites from employing harmless bots to aggregate information that users want in a readily accessible format since it might encourage consumers to look elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intangible</b> <b>property,</b> {{also known}} as incorporeal property, {{describes}} something which a person or corporation can have ownership of and can transfer ownership to another person or corporation, but has no physical substance, for example brand identity or knowledge/intellectual property. It generally refers to statutory creations such as copyright, trademarks, or patents. It excludes tangible property like real property (land, buildings, and fixtures) and personal property (ships, automobiles, tools, etc.). In some jurisdictions <b>intangible</b> <b>property</b> {{are referred to as}} choses in action. <b>Intangible</b> <b>property</b> is used in distinction to tangible property. It is useful to note that there are two forms of intangible property: legal <b>intangible</b> <b>property</b> (which is discussed here) and competitive <b>intangible</b> <b>property</b> (which is the source from which legal <b>intangible</b> <b>property</b> is created but cannot be owned, extinguished, or transferred). Competitive <b>intangible</b> <b>property</b> disobeys the intellectual property test of voluntary extinguishment and therefore results in the sources that create intellectual property (knowledge in its source form, collaboration, process-engagement, etc.) escaping quantification.|$|E
