Overlying Cenomanian strata have δ 13 C values of − 24 ‰ to − 23 ‰ {{that are similar}} to pre-excursion values. The absence of an intervening positive excursion (as exists in marine records of the Albian-Cenomanian boundary) likely results from a depositional hiatus. The corresponding positive δ 13 C event and proposed depositional hiatus are concordant with a regionally identified sequence boundary in the Dakota Formation (D 2), as well as a major regressive phase throughout the globe at the Albian-Cenomanian boundary. Data from RCP confirm suggestions that some positive carbon-isotope excursions in the geologic record are coincident with regressive sea-level phases. We estimate using <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlation</b> that the D 2 sequence boundary at RCP was on the order of 0. 5 m. y. in duration. Therefore, interpretations of isotopic events and associated environmental phenomena, such as oceanic anoxic events, in the shallow-marine and terrestrial record may be influenced by stratigraphic incompleteness.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new online global database of riverine water stable isotopes (Global Network of Isotopes in Rivers, GNIR) and evaluate its longer-term data holdings. Overall, 218 GNIR river stations were clustered into three different groups based on the seasonal variation in their isotopic composition, which was closely coupled to precipitation and snowmelt water runoff regimes. Sinusoidal fit functions revealed phases within each grouping and deviations from the sinusoidal functions revealed important river alterations or hydrological processes in these watersheds. The seasonal isotopic amplitude of δ 18 O in rivers averaged 2. 5 ‰, and did not increase {{as a function of}} latitude, like it does for global precipitation. Low seasonal isotopic amplitudes in rivers suggest the prevalence of mixing and storage such as occurs via lakes, reservoirs, and groundwater. The application of a catchment-constrained regionalized cluster-based water isotope prediction model (CC-RCWIP) allowed for direct comparison between the expected isotopic compositions for the upstream catchment precipitation with the measured isotopic composition of river discharge at observation stations. The catchment-constrained model revealed a strong global <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlation</b> between average rainfall and river discharge (R 2 = 0. 88) and the study demonstrated that the seasonal isotopic composition and variation of river water can be predicted.

This {{study investigated the}} isotopes in rainfall during the 2013 and 2014 hydrological years in the Douala and Yaounde urban cities. The objectives were to generate local meteoric water lines (LMWLs), define the spatial–temporal variations of the isotopes in rainwater {{and their relationship to}} the regional precipitation cycle, and determine the factors controlling the isotopic variation. The LWMLs in Douala and Yaounde were δD =  7.92 δ 18 O +  12.99 and δD =  8.35 δ 18 O +  15.29, respectively. The slopes indicate isotopic equilibrium conditions during rain formation and negligible evaporation effect during rainfall. Precipitation showed similar wide ranges in δ 18 O values from − 5.26 to − 0.75  ‰ in Douala and − 5.8 to + 1.81  ‰ in Yaounde suggesting a common moisture source from the Atlantic Ocean. Enriched weighted mean δ 18 O (wδ 18 O) values during the low pre- and post-monsoon showers coincided with low convective activity across the entire region. Enriched isotopic signatures also marked the West African monsoon transition phase during each hydrological year. Abrupt wδ 18 O depletion after the transition coincided with the monsoon onset in the region. Peak periods of monsoonal rainfall, associated with high convective activities, were characterised by the most depleted wδ 18 O values. Controls on isotopic variations are the amount effect and moisture recycling. The stable isotope data provide a tool for groundwater recharge studies while the <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlation</b> with regional rainfall cycle demonstrate their use as markers of moisture circulation and detecting climatic changes in precipitation.|$|E

Their chemical and isotopic compositions, mainly Sr and Nd isotopic compositions, in the total suspended particles (TSP) and finer fraction (phi < 5 mu m) in the TSP were analysed. There is a slight difference in the chemical compositions of TSP and the phi < 5 mu m fraction that can probably {{be attributed to the}} relative increase of silt and/or clay in the phi < 5 mu m fraction. Sr- 87 /Sr- 86 ratios were 0. 71770 - 0. 72030 in the TSP and 0. 72349 - 0. 72737 in the phi < 5 mu m fraction over all sampling sites, although epsilon(Nd) (0) values were relatively constant, from - 11. 3 to - 9. 3. The isotopic characteristics due to the variation of particle size are clearly seen in Rb-Sr and Sr-Nd <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlation</b> diagrams, which are useful aids to identify the sources of Asian dust.

40|$|Background: As part of {{the only}} {{national}} survey of lead in Australian children, which was undertaken in 1996, lead isotopic and lead concentration measurements were obtained from children from 24 dwellings whose blood lead levels were ≥ 15 μg/dL {{in an attempt to}} determine the source(s) of their elevated blood lead. Comparisons were made with data for six children with lower blood lead levels (< 10 μg/dL). Methods: Thermal ionisation and isotope dilution mass spectrometry were used to determine high precision lead isotopic ratios (²⁰⁸Pb/²⁰⁶Pb, ²⁰⁷Pb/²⁰⁶Pb and ²⁰⁶Pb/²⁰⁴Pb) and lead concentrations in blood, dust from floor wipes, soil, drinking water and paint (where available). Evaluation of associations between blood and the environmental samples was based on the analysis of individual cases, and Pearson correlations and multiple regression analyses based on the whole dataset. Results and discussion: The correlations showed an association for isotopic ratios in blood and wipes (r= 0. 52, 95 % CI 0. 19 - 0. 74), blood and soil (r= 0. 33, 95 % CI - 0. 05 - 0. 62), and blood and paint (r= 0. 56, 95 % CI 0. 09 - 0. 83). The regression analyses indicated that the only statistically significant relationship for blood isotopic ratios was with dust wipes (B= 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 35 - 0. 95); there were no significant associations for lead concentrations in blood and environmental samples. There is a strong <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlation</b> of soils and house dust (r= 0. 53, 95 % CI 0. 20 - 0. 75) indicative of a common source(s) for lead in soil and house dust.

A training set of commercial poultry feeds and egg albumen from 49 poultry farms across The Netherlands {{was used to determine}} the isotopic variability of organic and conventional feeds and to assess trophic effects of these corresponding feeds and barn, free range, and organic farming regimens on corresponding egg albumen. A further 52 brands of New Zealand eggs were sampled from supermarket shelves in 2008 (18), 2010 (30), and 2014 (4) to characterize and monitor changes in caged, barn, free range, and organic egg farming regimens. Stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotopes of 49 commercial poultry feeds and their corresponding egg albumens reveals that Dutch poultry are fed exclusively on a plant-based feed and {{that it is possible to}} discriminate between conventional and organic egg farming regimens in The Netherlands. Similarly, it is possible to discriminate between New Zealand organic and conventional egg farming regimens, although in the initial screening in 2008, results showed that some organic eggs had isotope values similar to those of conventional eggs, suggesting hens were not exclusively receiving an organic diet. Dutch and New Zealand egg regimens were shown to have a low <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlation</b> between both countries, because of different poultry feed compositions. In New Zealand, both conventional and organic egg whites have higher δ 15 N values than corresponding Dutch egg whites, due to the use of fishmeal or meat and bone meal (MBM), which is banned in European countries. This study suggests that stable isotopes (specifically nitrogen) show particular promise as a screening and authentication tool for organically farmed eggs. Criteria to assess truthfulness in labeling of organic eggs were developed, and we propose that Dutch organic egg whites should have a minimum δ 15 N value of 4. 8 ‰ to account for an organic plant derived diet. Monitoring of New Zealand egg isotopes over the past 7 years suggests that organic eggs should have a minimum δ 15 N value of 6. 0 ‰, and eggs falling below this value should be investigated further by certification authorities. </p...|$|E

The conclusions reached in the investigation support alternative models which have been mainly based on Xe data by Lewis et al. (1975, 1977). Because of the relatively high noble gas abundances in the separates studied, disturbance from nuclear effects occurring in situ such as spallation and neutron capture is insignificant, offering an opportunity to study primordial Ar, Kr, and Xe.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of geochemical signatures, Mesozoic {{magmatism}} in Antarctica is divided into the Ferrar Magmatic Province and the Dronning Maud Land Province. The tholeiitic magmatism of the Ferrar Magmatic Province is distinguished by such features as low Ti/Y (0. 709). All of these geochemical features indicate a major contribution from the continental mantle lithosphere in the generation of these magmas. In contrast, the Dronning Maud Land magmatism has elevated trace element ratios and εNd values (Ti/Y 250 – 600; Zr/Y 3. 0 – 9. 0; εNd − 2 to + 3) and lower initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (< 0. 707) relative to the Ferrar Magmatic Province.

40|$|The {{inorganic}} silicate fraction {{extracted from}} bulk pelagic sediments from the North Pacific Ocean is eolian dust. It monitors {{the composition of}} continental crust exposed to erosion in Asia. 176 Lu/ 177 Hf ratios of modern dust are subchondritic between 0. 011 and 0. 016 but slightly elevated with respect to immature sediments. Modern dust samples display a large range in Hf isotopic composition (IC), - 4. 70 < epsilon-Hf < + 16. 45, which encompasses that observed for the time series of DSDP cores 885 / 886 and piston core LL 44 -GPC 3 extending back to the late Cretaceous. Hafnium and neodymium isotopic {{results are consistent with}} a dominantly binary mixture of dust contributed from island arc volcanic material and dust from central Asia. The Hf-Nd <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlation</b> for all modern dust samples, epsilon-Hf= = 0. 78 epsilon-Nd = + 5. 66 (n = 22, R** 2 = 0. 79), is flatter than those reported so far for terrestrial reservoirs. Moreover, the variability in epsilon-Hf of Asian dust exceeds that predicted on the basis of corresponding epsilon-Nd values (34. 76 epsilon-Hf < + 2. 5; - 10. 96 < epsilon-Nd <- 10. 1). This is attributed to: (1) the fixing of an important unradiogenic fraction of Hf in zircons, balanced by radiogenic Hf that is mobile in the erosional cycle, (2) the elevated Lu/Hf ratio in chemical sediments which, given time, results in a Hf signature that is radiogenic compared with Hf expected from its corresponding Nd isotopic components, and (3) the possibility that diagenetic resetting of marine sediments may incorporate a significant radiogenic Hf component into diagenetically grown minerals such as illite. Together, these processes may explain the variability and more radiogenic character of Hf isotopes when compared to the Nd isotopic signatures of Asian dust. The Hf-Nd isotope time series of eolian dust are consistent with the results of modern dust except two samples that have extremely radiogenic Hf for their Nd (epsilon-Hf =+ 8. 6 and + 10. 3, epsilon-Nd = 39. 5 and 39. 8). These data may point to a source contribution of dust unresolved by Nd and Pb isotopes. The Hf IC of eolian dust input to the oceans may be more variable and more radiogenic than previously anticipated. The Hf signature of Pacific seawater, however, has varied little over the past 20 Myr, especially across the drastic increase of eolian dust flux from Asia around 3. 5 Ma. Therefore, continental contributions to seawater Hf appear to be riverine rather than eolian. Current predictions regarding the relative proportions of source components to seawater Hf must account for the presence of a variable and radiogenic continental component. Data on the IC and flux of river-dissolved Hf to the oceans are urgently required to better estimate contributions to seawater Hf. This then would permit the use of Hf isotopes as a monitor of past changes in erosion...|$|E
40|$|Chalk {{deposition}} characterises {{most of the}} Late Cretaceous {{period in}} many areas of the world. In Tunisia it occurred predominantly during the Campanian - Maastrichtian stages. The facies, characteristic of the Abiod Chalk Formation, shows high potential as a petroleum reservoir rock. Cored intervals of the uppermost Aleg and Abiod formations (around 100 m) have been logged and sampled in detail from three wells (Miskar 6, A- 3, A- 11) in the Miskar Gas Field, Gulf of Gabes, offshore eastern Tunisia. The uppermost Abiod and the base of the overlying El Haria Formation have been logged and sampled in one additional well (Miskar A- 7). Around 500 m of sediments were logged and sampled in detail through an onshore section at Le Kef (NW Tunisia) covering the uppermost Le Kef Formation, the entire Abiod Formation, and the base of the El Haria Formation. A small additional section (Kodiet ez Zarbia) near Le Kef was also examined. Low-resolution biostratigraphic studies were carried out on the Miskar A- 3 well and the Le Kef section and compared to previous studies. The Abiod Formation in the Miskar Field is Campanian - lowest Maastrichtian, the uppermost Aleg is upper Turonian - Coniacian, indicating an unconformity between the two formations. The El Haria Formation is lower Maastrichtian. The Abiod Formation at Le Kef and Kodiet ez Zarbia is Campanian - lower Maastrichtian. A strontium isotope ([sup] 87 Sr/[sup] 86 Sr) stratigraphy (SIS) study confirms the biostratigraphy. 	l. A geochemical investigation of 19 elements in the Miskar wells and 12 elements at Le Kef has allowed the vertical geochemical profiles to be constrained, five of which (Ca, Al, Mn, Ti, Zr) are suited for correlation. Eight chemostratigraphic units are defined in the offshore wells. Lateral correlation between Le Kef and Miskar 6 has been achieved, and nine geochemical correlation sequences (GCS) are established. This correlation demonstrates that although non-deposition occurred during part of the early Campanian in the Miskat area, the Abiod Formation is here a condensed chalk succession corresponding to most of the Abiod at Le Kef. Carbon ([delta][sup] 13 C) and oxygen ([delta][sup] 18 O) stable-isotope curves were obtained through the Le Kef section and the Miskar 6 and A- 11 wells, with additional data for selected samples from A- 3 and A- 7. The stable isotope study of the Miskar wells confirms the unconformity between the Aleg and Abiod formations indicated by biostratigraphic and SIS studies. An <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlation</b> of the Abiod Formation between Miskar and Le Kef has been achieved with the definition of eight isotope correlation sequences (IsS). The identification of geochemical and isotopic discontinuities validates the use of chemostratigraphy as a tool for the recognition of stratigraphically significant surfaces and marker beds. The [delta][sup] 13 C curve for the Abiod Formation at Le Kef is correlated to other Tethyan, Boreal and NW Pacific Ocean sections. Fourteen correlation sequences (CC) including the eight isotope correlation sequences (IsS) are identified, two of which are considered to be major isotopic events: one positive (Mid-Campanian Event) and one negative (Upper Campanian Event) carbon isotope excursion. These are dated at 78. 7 Ma and 74. 8 Ma respectively, and lasted 600 - 750 kyr each. The correlation confirms that carbon isotope. trends reflect global rather than local processes. Correlations can be used to test the validity of Campanian global biostratigraphic frameworks, and improve our understanding of the nature and timing of Late Cretaceous sea-level change. The [delta][sup] 13 C curves are correlated to local and global sea-level curves, indicating that positive [delta][sup] 13 C excursions are mainly associated with transgressive system tracts, whereas negative excursions are related to regressive systems. The manganese chemostratigraphy is correlated between Tunisia, Italy and the Danish Basin. Manganese combined with Ca, Al, Zr, and Ti data, and integrated with [delta][sup] 13 C curves, provides another robust tool for reconstructing stratigraphic sequences and identifying sea-level change in pelagic - hemipelagic carbonate successions...|$|E

The low 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (0. 51238) and high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 70512) ratios of the Ridge crest basalts suggest derivation from an old Nd/Sm and Rb/Sr enriched mantle source.

A composite section of the Noonday Formation displays a chemostratigraphic profile with values near − 3 ‰ through the cap dolostone of the Sentinel Peak Member, a decline to − 6 ‰ in the lower part of the Radcliff Member, followed by a recovery to near 0 ‰ and subsequent decline toward − 2 ‰ in the remainder of the Radcliff units and lower Mahogany Flats Member, and then a return to positive values (4 ‰) through the remainder of the Mahogany Flats Member. This pattern matches the Ediacaran cap carbonate in Namibia remarkably well, and, assuming our carbon <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlations</b> are correct, it indicates that Noonday deposition occurred at the beginning of the Ediacaran Period, and that the immediately underlying Wildrose Diamictite of the Kingston Peak Formation probably represents the younger Cryogenian (Marinoan) glacial episode. </p...|$|R

40|$|The Red Pine Shale (RPS; ~ 1120 m), {{uppermost}} {{formation of}} the Neoproterozoic Uinta Mountain Group, Utah, is an organic-rich sedimentary succession that represents marine deltaic systems delivering mature sediment from the east and immature sediment from the north. Multiple data sets suggest regional climate and sea-level changes associated with changing organic carbon burial rates. Six facies identified represent wave-, tidal-, and river-influenced parts of the distal prodelta to delta front. The shale facies is interpreted as distal prodeltaic deposition in a marine environment. The concretion facies is interpreted as prodeltaic deposition to distal prodelta. The shale-sandstone facies represents suspension settling with dilute density currents in a proximal prodelta to delta front environment. The slump fold facies was deposited on the proximal prodelta or delta front. The sandstone facies represents deposition on the delta front and shows marine- and river- influences. The pebbly sandstone facies is representative of a delta front environment. 	C-isotope values from this shale range from - 29. 46 / to - 16. 91 / PDB and TOC from 0. 04 % to 5. 91 %. Combined H/C, TOC, and local-regional <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlations</b> suggest that these values are representative of C-isotope composition of Neoproterozoic seawater. The composite C-isotope curve for the RPS is less negative values near the base, followed by a long decline to a thick interval of homogeneous lower values. Petrographic analyses reveal immature arkosic sandstone and mature quartz arenite populations. Detrital zircon data show an Archean population from the Wyoming Craton {{to the north and}} a mixed Proterozoic/Archean population from the east-southeast. Measured sections show north to south delta progradation with a proximal source to the north and a mature sediment source to the east. The composite section shows one low-order regressive cycle and ~ 11 high-order cycles. There is a relationship between C-isotope values, shale geochemistry, and lithostratigraphy. Less negative C-isotope values correspond with increased kaolinite and facies indicating higher sea-level. These relationships are seen in the correlative Chuar Group, Arizona, and a similar model is suggested for their origin: humid climate, high organic carbon burial rates, and high sea-level.

40|$|Sequence- and bio- stratigraphic {{techniques}} are well-established tools for correlating sediments globally and regionally. More recently Carbon isotopes {{have been used}} to make higherresolution global correlations of thin stratigraphic units, {{based on the assumption that}} carbon is evenly mixed in the atmosphere and the oceans have uniform isotopic composition with respect to Carbon. In a recent attempt to utilize Carbon isotopes for correlating 450 million-year-old meter-scale units between Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana, apparently anomalous isotopic readings were found in tidal-flat sediments (the Tate Member of the Ashlock Formation) at Point Leavell, KY. These values do not match values reported from other sections of similar age. Since tidal flat sediments are fossil poor, and since fossils are necessary to calibrate global <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlations,</b> tidal flat sediments were not represented in previous studies. Furthermore, tidal flat sediments are richer in the mineral dolomite whereas subtidal sediments are richer in calcite. Therefore there are two possible explanations for the anomalous readings: 1) the dolomitic tidal-flat sediments could have biased the isotopic composition, or 2) the extremely shallow-water environments could have preserved sediments at a time when other sediments are not preserved. To test the hypothesis that isotopic values were biased in sediments containing dolomite, XRD techniques were employed on a selection of samples from the Point Leavell outcrop including samples whose isotopes were anomalously enriched in 13 C (carbon 13). The isotopic composition is not correlated with calcite composition indicating that the relative proportion of calcite and dolomite (hence subtidal vs intertidal environments) in sediments did not bias isotopic composition. This implies that restricted shallow water circulation may not have affected isotopic composition in any particular way, but rather that tidal flat deposits accumulated at different times from subtidal deposits, thereby preserving different isotopic signatures. Intertidal sediments are rarely considered in global correlations. In the past, when fossiliferous subtidal sediments were the focus, the ages of the tidal flats were assumed to be the same as the subtidal, and this study reveals that the ages are in fact, different. They represent “time slices” not previously considered in reconstructing earth history. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|The Bjerkreim-Sokndal layered {{intrusion}} forms {{part of the}} Proterozoic South Rogaland Igneous Complex {{of southwest}} Norway. The intrusion has been divided into two parts; an anorthositic to gabbro-noritic Layered Series, and a generally more massive mangeritic, quartz-mangeritic to charnockitic upper part. On the basis of repeated lithological sequences, the Layered Series has been divided {{into a number of}} megacyclic units which are interpreted as reflecting magma chamber replenishment. Initial (940 Ma) Sr, Nd and Pb isotope ratios for plagioclases separated from samples crossing the transition between megacyclic unit III and megacyclic unit IV range from 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) = 0. 7048, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd(i) = 0. 51156 (ε(Nd) = + 2. 6) and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb(i) = 17. 50; to 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) = 0. 7061, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd(i) = 0. 51143 (ε(Nd) = + 0. 1) and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb(i) = 17. 73. The isotopic compositions vary systematically with stratigraphic height, and the interplay between the three isotopic systems is used to divide the stratigraphic profile into two parts: replenishment and post-replenishment. Across the replenishment interval isotopic variations are consistent with mixing between a resident and a replenishing magma. The replenishing magma was characterized by 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) = 0. 7048, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd(i) = 0. 51156 (ε(Nd) = + 2. 6) and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb(i) = 17. 50. The positive ε(Nd) of this magma indicates that its source region was either in the mantle or was itself recently derived from the mantle. In contrast the resident magma had 87 Sr/ 86 Sr(i) = 0. 7061; 143 Nd/ 144 Nd(i) = 0. 51143 (ε(Nd) = + 0. 1) and 206 Pb/ 204 Pb(i) = 17. 73 indicating that it had assimilated crustal material. In addition, the <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlations</b> across the replenishment interval indicate that prior to mixing the concentrations of Nd and Pb in the resident magma had been strongly reduced, probably by fractionation of apatite. Above the replenishment interval, Nd and Pb isotopic variations are apparently decoupled from Sr isotopic variations. Two mechanisms are proposed for achieving this. The first is heterogeneous mixing of up to 20 % of a third magmatic component into an already isotopically stratified magma chamber. The second is the presence of 10 %- 20 % of post-cumulus plagioclase that crystallized from a migrating intercumulus melt. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.

These holes are {{situated on the}} crest and mid and lower northwest flank of a NNW-SSE-trending ridge block which would have closely paralleled the paleo mid-ocean ridge (Rabinowitz and LaBrecque, 1979 doi: 10. 1029 /JB 084 iB 11 p 05973, Moore et al. (1983 doi: 10. 1130 / 0016 - 7606 (1983) 94 2. 0. CO; 2). The basalts were erupted approximately 70 m. y. ago, an age equivalent to that of immediately adjacent oceanic crust in the Angola Basin and coraistent with formation at the paleo mid-ocean ridge (Moore et al., 1983). The basalt types vary from aphyric quartz tholeiites on the ridge crest to highly plagioclase phyric olivine tholeiites on the ridge flank. These show systematic differences in incompatible trace element and isotopic composition. Many element and isotope ratio pairs form systematic trends with the ridge crest basalts {{at one end and}} the highly phyric ridge flank basalts at the other. The low 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (0. 51238), 206 Pb/ 204 Pb (17. 54), 207 Pb/ 204 Pb (15. 47), 208 Pb/ 204 Pb (38. 14) and high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 70512) ratios of the ridge crest basalts suggest derivation from an old Nd/Sm-, Rb/Sr- and Pb/U-enriched mantle source. This isotopic signature {{is similar to that of}} alkaline basalts on Tristan da Cunha but offset to significantly lower Nd and Pb isotopic ratios. The isotopic ratio trends may be extrapolated beyond the ridge flank basalts with higher 143 Nd/ 144 Nd (0. 51270), 206 Pb/ 204 Pb (18. 32), 207 Pb/ 204 Pb (15. 52), 208 Pb/ 204 Pb (38. 77) and lower 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 70417) ratios in the direction of increasingly Nd/Sm-, Rb/Sr- and Pb/U-depleted source compositions. These <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlations</b> are equally consistent with mixing of depleted and enriched end member melts or partial melting of an inhomogeneous, variably enriched mantle source. However, observed Zr-Ba-Nb-Y interelement relationships are inconsistent with any simple two-component model of magma mixing, as might result from the rise of a lower mantle plume through the upper mantle. Incompatible element and Pb isotopic systematics also preclude extensive involvement of depleted (N-type) MORB material or its mantle sources. In our preferred petrogenetic model the Walvis Ridge basalts were derived by partial melting of mantle similar to an enriched (E-type) MORB source which had become heterogeneous on a small scale due to the introduction of small-volume melts and metasomatic fluids...|$|R

But, according to the field discrimination between surficial mobile sands related to present trade-winds and lower weakly hardened sands related to paleowesterlies, recent inland studies in Fuerteventura (eastern Canary Islands) and south-western Morocco show that the Upper Pleistocene dry paleoclimate was geographically restricted to the Moroccan coasts and off-shore islands, in relation with a cold marine current supplied by ice melting waters which precisely stopped the rain formation in spite of prevailing westerlies. In Fuerteventura, a detailed field work and a critical study of numerous isotopic data relates to the repeatedly emplacement of hardened dune sands deposited between interlayered grey to brown thin paleosoils during the Stages 2 and 3. Good lithostratigraphical and <b>isotopic</b> <b>correlations</b> with these Canarian observations occur from the field data studied in various Moroccan coastal regions (Tiznit, Safi. Rabat). Finally, a chronology supported by more than very coherent 30 l 4 C datations infers a relation between the sand dunes spreading and intervening maxima of icebergs in Northern Atlantic; and between the interlayered paleosoils and intercalated wanning periods. At {{the end of the}} Lateglacial period, simultaneous climatic and environmental changes occur in eastern Canary Islands and coastal Morocco: a sand remobilization then an erosive crisis between 14000 and 10000 y. BP are consequential to important changes leading to interglacial conditions in the Holocene. In the both countries, morphological observations on mobile sands, supported by mineralogical and isotopic data, show that the trade-wind and associated up-welling replaced, in the Holocene, the westerlies and ice melting current; moreover major Saharan dust deposition causes upper light to brown silty deposits into the Canary Islands.

Using elemental ratios as well as Pb, Sr, and Nd isotopic compositions as tracers, we found preliminary results concerning the trace metal enrichment and the chemical/isotopic signatures of the most important emission sources using the lichen Xanthoria parietina sampled at 15 sites along a SW-NE transect. The concentrations of these elements decreased with increasing distance from the historical and actual steel-work areas. The combination of the different tracers (major elements, Rare Earth Element ratios, Pb, Sr and Nd isotopes) enabled us to distinguish between three principal sources: the historical steel production (old tailings corresponding to blast-furnace residues), the present steel production (industrial sites with arc electric furnace units) and the regional background (baseline) components.

The ecophysiological basis of this niche difference is not understood well. Here we test the hypothesis that these two species present distinct water use efficiencies (WUEs), using the carbon isotope discrimination approach. Leaves and 13 dated ring sequences were sampled in 10 pairs of adult trees growing side by side. Carbon isotope composition was measured on cellulose extracts. In addition, relationships between carbon isotope discrimination and wood anatomy were assessed at the tree level. Quercus robur displayed a 1. 0 parts per thousand larger isotopic discrimination than Q. petraea and therefore a lower intrinsic WUE (- 13 %). This interspecific difference of isotopic discrimination was quite stable with time and independent of tree radial growth and climate fluctuations. A strong positive correlation was observed between average tree values of earlywood vessel surface area and C- 13 <b>isotopic</b> discrimination. This <b>correlation</b> was even higher with C- 13 of the 1976 dry year (r = 0. 86).

40|$|Numerous calcium {{carbonate}} veins were {{recovered from the}} igneous basement of the Early Cretaceous Shatsky Rise during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 324. The chemical (Sr/Ca, Mg/Ca) and isotopic (87 Sr/ 86 Sr, 143 Nd/ 144 Nd, delta 18 O, delta 13 C) compositions of these veins were determined to constrain the timing of vein formation. A dominant control by seawater chemistry on calcite composition is evident for most vein samples with variable contributions from the basaltic basement. Slightly elevated precipitation temperatures (as inferred from oxygen isotope ratios), indicative of hydrothermal vein formation, are only observed at Site U 1350 in {{the central part of}} Shatsky Rise. The highest 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios (least basement influence) of vein samples at each drill site range from 0. 70726 to 0. 70755 and are believed to reflect the contemporaneous seawater composition during the time of calcite precipitation. In principle, age information can be deduced by correlating these ratios with the global seawater Sr isotope evolution. Since the Sr isotopic composition of seawater has fluctuated three times between the early and mid Cretaceous, no unambiguous precipitation ages can be constrained by this method and vein precipitation could have occurred at any time between ~ 80 and 140 Ma. However, based on combined chemical and <b>isotopic</b> data and <b>correlations</b> of vein composition with formation depth and inferred temperature, we argue for a rather early precipitation of the veins shortly after basement formation at each respective drill site...|$|R

Field observations, petrographic descriptions, trace element, and isotope analyses combined with U-Pb zircon geochronology are presented to determine the time frame of magmatism and tectonic setting during the formation of these rocks. Results document three magmatic episodes with different melt sources for (1) granites, (2) a diorite-trondhjemite-plagiogranite sequence, and (3) diabases and lavas. Granites, dated at 170 – 175 [*]Ma, represent crystallized melt with a strong continental isotopic contribution. The diorite-trondhjemite-plagiogranite sequence is 165 – 153 [*]Ma old and derives from a mantle magma source with minor continental contribution. East-west trending diabase dikes and bodies intruded the granitoids, which were eroded and then covered by Valanginian (140 – 133 [*]Ma) alkaline lavas and sediments.

Temporal <b>correlation</b> with plutonites of the Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone to the northwest defines a narrow, NW-SE striking and nearly 2000 [*]km long belt of Jurassic intrusions. The increasing mantle influence in the magma sources is explained by thinning of continental lithosphere and related mantle upwelling/decompression melting. Accordingly, the formation of the studied igneous rocks is related to the extension of the Iranian continental margin, which ultimately led to the formation of the Tethys-related North Makran Ophiolites...|$|R
