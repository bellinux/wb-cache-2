500|$|During a {{scene in}} the van, Tom Haverford tells Leslie he changed his name because his {{original}} name was too foreign sounding {{for a career in}} politics. When Leslie points about U.S. President Barack Obama has a foreign-sounding name, Tom gets upset. The reference to Obama's name was originally featured in a scene that was cut from Parks and Recreation pilot episode. Offerman, who barely moves and is often quiet throughout the episode, said he learned to use humor amid silence while serving as an altar boy and lector at his church. Offerman said, [...] "I had a cousin in the congregation, and I would speak with the utmost, august stoicism, and everyone would think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> effective speaker. But he knew I was being facetious. He'd get in trouble for cracking up." ...|$|E
500|$|Returning to the Old Vic for the 1930–31 season, Gielgud {{found several}} {{changes to the}} company. Donald Wolfit, who loathed him and was himself disliked by his colleagues, was dropped, as was Adele Dixon. Gielgud was {{uncertain}} of the suitability {{of the most prominent}} new recruit, Ralph Richardson, but Williams was sure that after this season Gielgud would move on; he saw Richardson as a potential replacement. The two actors had little in common. Richardson recalled, [...] "He was a kind of brilliant butterfly, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> gloomy sort of boy", and [...] "I found his clothes extravagant, I found his conversation flippant. He was the New Young Man of his time and I didn't like him." [...] The first production of the season was Henry IV, Part 1, in which Gielgud as Hotspur had the best of the reviews. Richardson's notices, and the relationship of the two leading men, improved markedly when Gielgud, who was playing Prospero in The Tempest, helped Richardson with his performance as Caliban: ...|$|E

He described a difficult family history of abuse and crime, writing: [...] "The men on my father's side include uneducated alcoholics, mental patients, and women beaters....

When asked about For Keeps (1988), Ringwald said, [...] "I didn't want to give the wrong message to teenagers. I sort of felt a certain {{responsibility}} – I mean, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> very famous teenager and I thought a lot of teenagers were looking up to me and emulating me, and I really didn't want to make a movie that said in any way that having a baby at that age was going to be easy."

2500|$|Gary Stephen Anderson {{was born}} on 5 August 1947 in Melbourne, Victoria, to an Australian father and Mauritian mother. He has a brother living in Melbourne {{by the name of}} Rodney. Anderson's {{nickname}} of [...] "Angry Ant" [...] developed [...] "during his youth after his aggressive and volatile nature got the better of him." [...] According to Anderson, his father [...] "was a deeply troubled man... I've dealt with my rage, my pain... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> angry boy... When he was around he was a very explosive person." [...] Anderson used his uncle, Ivan, as his role model, he [...] "was a cigarette-smoking, beer-drinking, leather jacket-wearing, motorcycle-riding drummer in a swing band." [...] Anderson grew up in suburban Coburg and attended Coburg Technical School before working as a fitter and turner in a factory. Initially {{he wanted to be a}} blues guitarist, [...] "I wanted to be like all the great blues guitar players, then I wanted to be like Bob Dylan, then of course... John Lennon." [...] Anderson found himself in a band with three possible guitarists and [...] "he other two were much better than me, so the only other thing we needed was a singer... had to sing 'Twist and Shout' without accompaniment. I just happened to be the best one at it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Callas herself {{appears to}} have been in {{agreement}} not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice as: [...] "The timbre was dark, almost black—when I think of it, I think of thick molasses", and in 1968 she added, [...] "They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo". Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood, It's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even Lucia, Anna Bolena, Puritani, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang Norma, Fidelio, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist [...] {{to be able to play}} everything; he [...] to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side.
