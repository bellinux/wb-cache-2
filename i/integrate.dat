40|$|Abstract: The IIRC {{states as}} its long term vision {{a world in}} which <b>integrated</b> {{thinking}} is embedded within mainstream business practice and therefore sees <b>integrated</b> thinking as key in fostering <b>integrated</b> reporting. This study seeks to establish how embedded <b>integrated</b> thinking is in the <b>integrated</b> reporting processes of a sample of JSE Listed entities as they produce <b>integrated</b> reports. The objective of this research is therefore to assess whether <b>integrated</b> reporting is achieving <b>integrated</b> thinking and to what extent business processes has been impacted by producing <b>integrated</b> reports by these entities. Assessing the nature of <b>integrated</b> thinking was based on a qualitative interpretative methodology using the research instrument of semi-structured interviews. Twelve nonexecutive, executive and senior management were interviewed and the interviews were analysed using a thematic approach. The research found that there were different levels of maturity in the adoption of <b>integrated</b> reporting and <b>integrated</b> thinking. The focus was generally more on producing the <b>integrated</b> report than developing <b>integrated</b> thinking. Overall, the research found that <b>integrated</b> reporting has not achieved the level of <b>integrated</b> thinking that would result in changing or significant influence {{in the way in which}} business is conducted. The research findings mean that further development needs to be done to ensure that <b>integrated</b> thinking is fully embedded in business practices. As the interviewees came from a spectrum of JSE Listed entities and from various levels of senior and non-executive management, the results provide an indication of the level of embeddedness of <b>integrated</b> thinking in the entities and how <b>integrated</b> reporting has impacted business practices.

5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder.

In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily <b>integrate</b> clues to lead to all three possible solutions.

40|$|The thesis adresses the {{phenomenon}} of <b>integrated</b> care. The implementation of <b>integrated</b> care for patients with a stroke or dementia is studied. Because a generic quality management model for <b>integrated</b> care is lacking, the study works towards building a development model for <b>integrated</b> care. Based on a systematic approach in which a literature study, a delphi study, a concept mapping study and questionnaire research are combined, a development model for <b>integrated</b> care is created. The model exists of 89 elements of <b>integrated</b> care, which are clustered in nine themes. Also the model describes four phases of development which <b>integrated</b> care services can experience. The model is succesfully empirically validated in 84 <b>integrated</b> care services for stroke, acute myocardial infarct or dementia patients. The model {{has the potential to}} serve as a generic quality management model for <b>integrated</b> care services and can be used for monitoring, self evaluation or benchmarking of <b>integrated</b> care services. Also insurers or policy makers could use the model to stimulate <b>integrated</b> care services to further improve and develop their <b>integrated</b> care...|$|R

40|$|An <b>integrated</b> {{orbit and}} {{attitude}} control algorithm for satellite formation flying was developed, and an <b>integrated</b> orbit and attitude software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulator was also developed to test and verify the <b>integrated</b> control algorithm. The <b>integrated</b> algorithm includes state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) control algorithm and PD feedback control algorithm as orbit and attitude controller respectively and configures the two algorithms with an <b>integrating</b> effect. The <b>integrated</b> SIL simulator largely comprises an orbit SIL simulator for orbit determination and control, and attitude SIL simulator for attitude determination and control. The two SIL simulators were designed considering {{the performance and}} characteristics of related hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulators and were combined into the <b>integrated</b> SIL simulator. To verify the developed <b>integrated</b> SIL simulator with the <b>integrated</b> control algorithm, an orbit simulation and <b>integrated</b> orbit and attitude simulation were performed for a formation reconfiguration scenario using the orbit SIL simulator and the <b>integrated</b> SIL simulator, respectively. Then, the two simulation results were compared and analyzed with each other. As a result, the user satellite in both simulations achieved successful formation reconfiguration, {{and the results of}} the <b>integrated</b> simulation were closer to those of actual satellite than the orbit simulation. The <b>integrated</b> orbit and attitude control algorithm verified in this study enables us to perform more realistic orbit control for satellite formation flying. In addition, the <b>integrated</b> orbit and attitude SIL simulator is able to provide the environment of easy test and verification not only for the existing diverse orbit or attitude control algorithms but also for <b>integrated</b> orbit and attitude control algorithms...|$|R
