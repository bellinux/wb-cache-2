Examples of mechanisms that international actors reportedly use to perform security sector reform include disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) programmes to try and synchronize reforms to the security sector—and rule of law reforms as justice and security sectors are often considered intertwined. Likewise, SSR can be performed along transitional justice processes if the security sector has a legacy of violence against the population—and during security policy discussions to use SSR in supporting the <b>implementation</b> <b>and</b> <b>reviews</b> of the states' national security policy and strategy.|$|R

40|$|DoctorateThis {{research}} set out {{to examine}} the impact of the Victorian Government's Accountability Framework, on three primary schools. Located within a naturalistic paradigm, this case study research focused on the understandings and experiences of principals, other school leaders and teachers, as they completed the first three-year cycle of implementation. Using the Hargreaves, Shaw and Fink (1997) Change Frames as the basis for interviews with participants, it was revealed that participants across the three schools faced many personal and professional challenges, as they engaged in processes of charter development, charter <b>implementation</b> <b>and</b> <b>review.</b> A mix of administrative, leadership, socio-cultural and educational factors impacted both positively and negatively on the implementation. A number of these factors were found to relate directly to political challenges of the period. The study reveals a key weakness in the Accountability Framework's capacity to translate findings arising from the self-evaluative components (Annual and Triennial Review) into teaching and learning practices. The findings suggest that there is a risk that some schools may `institutionalise' the practices of charter development, <b>implementation</b> <b>and</b> <b>review,</b> to meet Education Department of Education and Training expectations, but without significantly addressing the real needs of students within the Framework's processes, strategies and outcomes. A number of recommendations are offered to help strengthen the impact of the Framework on school improvement practices, and especially teaching and learning outcomes.
