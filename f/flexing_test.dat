40|$|Background and Aims: Most central venous {{catheters}} {{are placed}} using Seldinger guide wires. EN ISO 11070 is the guideline for testing guide wire flexing performance and tensile strength, {{and we can}} safely assume that guide wires in use meet these requirements. Unfortunately, EN ISO 11070 guidelines {{do not reflect the}} clinical requirements and we continue to see mechanical failures and their associated complications. Material and Methods: This in vitro study was performed in an accredited laboratory. With regard to flexing, we: (1) Established the minimum flexing performance needed to meet clinical requirements, (2) developed flexing performance tests which mimic clinical requirement, and (3) evaluated the mechanical properties of various guide wires relative to these requirements. With regard to tensile strength, we used the testing method prescribed in ISO 11070, but did not end the test at 5 Newton (N). We continued until the guide wire was damaged, or we reached maximum tractive force. We then did a wire-to-wire comparison. We examined two basic wire constructions, monofil and core and coil. Results: Tensile strength: All wires tested, except one, met EN ISO 11070 requirements for 5 N tensile strength. The mean of the wire types tested ranged from 15. 06 N to 257. 76 N. Flexing performance: None of the wires kinked. The monofil had no evidence of bending. Two core/coil wires displayed minor bending (angle 1. 5 °). All other wires displayed bending angles between 22. 5 ° and 43. 0 °. Conclusion: We recommend that: (1) Clinicians use guide wires with high-end mechanical properties, (2) EN ISO 11070 incorporate our <b>flexing</b> <b>test</b> into their testing method, raise the flexing requirement to kink-proof, (3) and raise the tensile strength requirement to a minimum of 30 N, and (3) all manufacturers and suppliers be required to display mechanical properties of all guide wire, and guide wire kits sold...|$|E

40|$|Cracking of {{multilayer}} ceramic capacitors, MLCCs, remains {{a serious problem}} for space systems. This problem increases substantially for large size capacitors and in cases when manual soldering is involved or the system experiences mechanical shock or vibration. In any case, a fracture occurs when the sum of external and internal mechanical stresses exceeds {{the strength of the}} part. To reduce the probability of cracking, the level of stress should be reduced, e. g. by optimizing the assembly workmanship and rules for board design, and the strength of the parts increased by selecting the most mechanically robust capacitors. The latter might possibly be achieved by selecting MLCCs based on the in-situ measurements of mechanical characteristics using four types of tests: flexural strength, hardness, fracture toughness, and <b>flex</b> bend <b>testing.</b> Note that military specifications MIL-PRF- 123 and MIL-PRF- 55681 do not have requirements for mechanical testing of the parts. However, specifications for automotive industry components employ two types of mechanical tests: beam load (break strength) test per AEC-Q 200 - 003 and board <b>flex</b> <b>test</b> per AEC-Q 200 - 005.

The pull test has limits set up by various organizations but normally 7.2N/cm is a value regarded as giving very good binding strength. For the Bindomatic system using regular copy paper the strength is 11N/cm and for non-coated color copy paper the strength is around 9N/cm. In general the hot melt binding is not recommended for coated, heavy-weight paper and the Bindomatic system is in that respect not different from other hot melt systems.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between length of the iliotibial band (ITB) and the medio-lateral position patella. Eighty subjects (37 male, 43 female) were examined for patella position and ITB length. All subjects were physically active, asymptomatic and aged between 18 and 34 years (mean 21. 5 years). ITB length was assessed using the Ober's test and modified Ober's test, with hip adduction angle being measured using a fluid goniometer. Patella position was assessed using the method first described by McConnell [The management of chondromalacia patellae: a long term solution. Australian Journal of Physiotherapy 1986; 32 : 215 – 22]. Patella position had a weak correlation (r= 0. 28) with modified Ober's (extended knee) test and a poor correlation with Ober's (knee <b>flexed)</b> <b>test</b> (r= 0. 1). In the group of 47 subjects with laterally displaced patellae, patella position had a moderate statistically significant correlation to ITB length measured by modified Ober's test (r= 0. 34, P= 0. 012). Only a poor relationship existed between Ober's test and patella position in the laterally displaced group. The results of this study only partially support the hypothesis that there is a relationship between ITB length and lateral patella displacement. The relationship was not strong enough to confirm ITB length as the only cause of lateral patella displacement...|$|R

However, brazing cannot be applied for {{electroformed}} metals since heat treatment {{could affect the}} fit, and, therefore, laser welding is used for such metals. New methods of joining metals that do not impair the characteristics of electroformed metals should be developed. When new coating is performed {{on the surface of}} the base metal, surface treatment is usually performed before re-coating. The effect of surface treatment is clinically evaluated by peeling and <b>flex</b> <b>tests.</b> However, these testing methods are not ideal for deposition coating strength measurement of electroformed metals.

This process makes it possible to remove residual deposits on the electrodeposited metal surface layer. 2. Cathode electrolysis is a simple and safe method that is capable of improving the surface treatment by adjustments to the current supply method and current intensity. 3.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references.. One of the {{greatest}} challenges in modern cosmology is determining the origin of the observed acceleration of the Universe. The 'dark energy' believed to supply the negative pressure responsible for this cosmic acceleration remains elusive despite over a decade of investigation. Hunting for deviation from the 'vanilla' cosmological model, ACDM, and detecting dynamics with redshift in the equation of state remains a key research area, with many challenges. We introduce some of the challenges in the search for such dark energy dynamics. We illustrate that under the assumption of well-motivated scaling models for dark energy dynamics early universe constraints on the dark energy density imply that these models will be essentially indistinguishable from ACDM for the next decade. After introducing the Fisher Matrix formalism, we derive the Fisher <b>Flex</b> <b>test</b> as a measure of whether the assumption of Gaussianity in the likelihood is incorrect for parameter estimation. This formalism is general for any cosmological survey. Lastly, we study the degeneracies between dark energy and curvature and matter in a non-parametric approach, and show that incorrectly assuming values of cosmological components can exactly mimic dark energy dynamics. We connect to the parametric approach by showing how these uncertainties also degrade constraints on the dark energy parameters in an assumed functional form for w.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{has examined the}} adhesive binding of paper, with {{particular attention to the}} action of the fiber/adhesive interface. The efforts of this research were concentrated on relating properties of the paper to strength of the resultant binding. To simulate the problems of economical binding styles, uncoated groundwood paper and hot melt adhesives were studied. Although the hypotheses assumed that a strong interfiber bond within the sheets would lead to a strong binding, {{it was found that the}} most critical factor was not the strength of the sheet, but the availability of the fibers to the adhesive. The strength of the sheet was measured by several tests. These tests were: tensile strength, internal bond, tear resistance, and pick resistance. None of these measures of paper strength correlated with binding strength. Other factors, specifically caliper, absorbency, and low pick resistance proved to be the significant factors leading to a strong binding. The general conclusion is that the greater the surface area of the fibers exposed to the glue, the greater the adhesive bond. Greater caliper, absorbency, and low pick resistance lead to increased exposure of fibers and therefore to a stronger binding for newsprint -grade papers. Previous studies with both coated and uncoated papers had indicated that roughness is the most important paper quality for a good binding with hot melt adhesives. This study finds that roughness is not a significant factor, and the thickness and low pick resistance are the most significant factors leading to a good binding with uncoated groundwoods. Acidity was tested for effects on binding strength. Even with accelerated aging, no evidence was found that the acidity of the sheet affects the strength of the adhesive binding. Binding strength was measured by page pull and <b>flex</b> <b>tests.</b> Both can be valuable tests, and in this case correlated well with each other...|$|R

These bundles rotate {{in opposite directions}} during translational motility. When not translating, they rotate in the same direction, and the cells flex. Here, we present evidence that asymmetrical rotation of the bundles during translation does not depend upon the chemotaxis signal transduction system. The histidine kinase CheA {{is known to be}} an essential component in the signaling pathway for bacterial chemotaxis. Mutants of cheA in flagellated bacteria continually rotate their flagella in one direction. B. burgdorferi has two copies of cheA designated cheA 1 and cheA 2. Both genes were found to be expressed in growing cells. We reasoned that if chemotaxis were essential for asymmetrical rotation of the flagellar bundles, and if the flagellar motors at both cell ends were identical, inactivation of the two cheA genes should result in cells that constantly <b>flex.</b> To <b>test</b> this hypothesis, the signaling pathway was completely blocked by constructing the double mutant cheA 1 ∷kan cheA 2 ∷ermC.

Rigidity (involuntary contraction of the abdominal muscles) is the most specific exam finding for diagnosing peritonitis (+ likelihood ratio: 3.9). The presence of these signs in a patient is sometimes referred to as peritonism. The localization of these manifestations depends on whether peritonitis is localized (e.g., appendicitis or diverticulitis before perforation), or generalized to the whole abdomen. In either case, pain typically starts as a generalized abdominal pain (with involvement of poorly localizing innervation of the visceral peritoneal layer), and may become localized later (with the involvement of the somatically innervated parietal peritoneal layer). Peritonitis is an example of an acute abdomen.|$|R
40|$|Field {{programmable}} gate arrays (FPGAs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} widespread reconfigurable devices in which various functions can be implemented by storing circuit connection information and logic values into configuration memories. One of the most important issues in the modern FPGA is the reduction of its static leakage power consumption. Flex Power FPGA, which has been proposed to overcome this problem, uses a body biasing technique to implement the fine-grained threshold voltage (Vt) programmability in the FPGA. A low-Vt state can be assigned only to the component circuits along the critical path of the application design mapped on the FPGA, so that the static leakage power consumption can be reduced drastically. Flex Power FPGA is an important application target for the SOTB (silicon on thin buried oxide) device, which features a wide-range body biasing ability and the high sensitivity of Vt variation by body biasing, resulting in a drastic subthreshold leakage current reduction caused by static leakage power. In this paper, the <b>Flex</b> Power FPGA <b>test</b> chip is fabricated in SOTB technology, and the functional test and performance evaluation of a mapped 32 -bit binary counter circuit are performed successfully.

All spontaneous and formalin-evoked behavioral responses were considered, In Expt. 2, only the higher concentration of oxotremorine (0. 2 mg/kg) was administered 15 or 1 min before the formalin test. The animals were killed 15, 30 or 60 min after formalin treatment. Blood was collected from the trunk to determine corticosterone plasma levels.

The mechanism of the tester is rather simple， but the function is unique.

This is certainly the case for isolating Shigellae from foods such as apple juice, potato salad, bagged peeled carrots, whole romaine lettuce, alfalfa sprouts, and green onions. A comparison of current methods was performed using USFDA Bacterial Analytical Method (BAM), USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment, Pathatrix IMS, and KingFisher Flex. Using {{the results from the}} comparisons, a novel streamlined method named Pathatrix-KingFisher was created for detecting and isolating Shigellae in green onions. The Immunomagnetic Separation (IMS) technology used by Pathatrix Auto and KingFisher Flex instruments aided in screening and recovery of Shigellae. Furthermore, a direct comparison of the USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment with my novel Pathatrix-KingFisher method on green onions was performed. Food samples were artificially inoculated with < 30 CFU/ 25 g of a previously - 80 ??C frozen Shigella flexneri 2457 M culture, and compared with no-spike controls and no-matrix controls. All methods were evaluated at 5 h and/or 24 h post-incubation for their detection and isolation efficacy. Presumptive positive isolates were confirmed to be Shigellae using TSI slants and/or qPCR with primers to the Shigellae specific ipaH gene. The USFDA BAM method was able to detect and recover Shigellae on processed foods (for example, apple juice, potato salad, bagged peeled carrots, whole romaine lettuce), but not for food with high background microbiota (for example, alfalfa sprouts and green onions). The USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment method was inconsistent at detecting and isolating Shigellae from all foods. The Pathatrix IMS method was effective at detecting Shigellae in foods, but was ineffective at isolating Shigellae. Both the Pathatrix IMS and KingFisher Flex were able to detect Shigellae using qPCR consistently after 5 h of incubation. The recoveries at 5 h incubation, even with the help of IMS from the two instruments, were inconsistent. Shigellae were detected and isolated regularly after 24 h of incubation using the KingFisher Flex. When compared to the USFDA 2009 modified Produce Assignment method, both the IMS methods were more consistent in detecting and isolating Shigellae in green onions. By using both instruments, my novel method, Pathatrix-KingFisher, takes advantage of the sensitivity of Pathatrix Auto sample size and the automation of the KingFisher Flex???s 96 - well format to generate consistent high-throughput results. Two automated platforms using immunomagnetic separation technology were compared for detecting and recovering Escherichia coli O 157 in ground beef and sprouts and Shigella flexneri in green onions. The foods were inoculated with < 20 CFU/ 25 g and tested at 5 and 24 h post-incubation. Immunomagnetic beads were mixed with food enrichments, processed through the Pathatrix Auto or KingFisher <b>Flex,</b> and <b>tested</b> by realtime PCR (qPCR) and recovery on selective agars. At 5 h, the Pathatrix Auto detected E. coli O 157 in 90...|$|R
40|$|Tibialis {{posterior}} {{transfer in}} central palsy of foot levators: a propos of 17 cases. AimTo evaluate, in spastic {{patients with a}} lack of tibialis anterior spontaneous contraction, the efficiency of the tibialis posterior transfer and the occurrence of adverse effects on the static foot posture. Patients and methodsSeventeen patients were evaluated retrospectively, on average 69 months after intervention (9 – 108). Mean age was 47 years (26 – 61). Seven patients presented stroke, 4 cranial trauma, 3 medullar trauma, 3 patients suffered respectively from cerebral palsy, cerebral tumor and cervical myelopathy. The tibialis posterior was transferred on the tibialis anterior in 9 cases, on the peroneus brevis in 5 cases, on the calcaneocuboid capsule once and on both tibialis anterior and calcaneocuboid capsule once. Three isolated talo-navicular arthrodesis and one triple arthrodesis were associated. ResultsWe found the need of orthosis decreased (P= 0, 021), 9 patients no longer needed their orthosis. The walking distance was significantly increased (P= 0, 031) in 9 patients. The average satisfaction score was 2. 71 / 4 (0 – 4). On average, the maximum active dorsiflexion reached the neutral position (− 20 to 20) with knee extended and 6 ° (− 10 – 20) with knee flexed; the arc of movement averaged 9 ° (0 – 40) knee extended and 16, 2 ° (0 – 40) knee <b>flexed</b> during analytic <b>testing</b> and 2, 8 ° (0 – 10) when walking. Only half of the patients presented a tenodesis effect when walking. Dorsiflexion strength averaged 1, 5 (0 – 5). Six patients had a normal plantar footprint, 8 a cavus foot and 2 a flatfoot, without any worsening compared to preoperative status. The Djian angle averaged 119, 5 ° (105 – 138) and the hindfoot alignment angle was 7, 7 ° valgus. There was no significant difference with the non-operated foot. DiscussionThe tibialis posterior transfer is effective in foot-drop in half of the patients, with a tenodesis effect that is not systematic in spastic patients. A flat valgus foot {{does not appear to be}} a long-term complication of this procedure...|$|R
40|$|Nickel-titanium (NiTi) alloys are {{qualified}} for orthodontics {{due to their}} unique shape memory effect, low elastic modulus, excellent springback and superelasticity. Up to now, wires of this type could only be joined via clamp- or crimp-connection. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate the laser welding of NiTi-wires and their mechanical properties. Material and method: 8 products of 3 different manufacturers with different dimensions were joined by use of a Nd:YAG-Laser. Two wire segments of 2 cm length were welded along a 3 mm parallel overlapping area with varying power settings (220 - 235 V) and pulse duration (1, 5 - 3, 5 ms). Each 5 samples were welded using the same laser settings. The elastic qualities of the welded and unwelded specimens were examined at an ambient temperature of 37 degrees in the computer-controlled bending <b>test</b> <b>FLEX.</b> Results: 796 of the 800 tests could be successfully joined. Power settings < 230 V and pulse durations < 3, 5 ms turned out to be ideal regarding the joint-solidity. 571 of the samples broke during bending up to 80 °. Mostly the fracture was localized in the margin areas of the weld. Only groups with &# 61619; 4 of 5 samples remaining intact were examined in the following (n= 110) : The stress/strain curves of the welded wires showed a change of the mechanical properties in comparison to unwelded wires: The average torque, which is necessary to apply forces within the scope of an orthodontic treatment, increased. Stiffness of the welded wires escalated due to the doubled thickness of the weld. The forces ocurring during bending partially exceeded the limit, which is recommended for orthodontic treatment. This could cause unwanted side-effects like root resorption. Furthermore, the pseudo-elastic plateau, which is clinically useful due to the constant force effect, is significantly shortened. In summary the super-elastic behavior of laser-welded orthodontic NiTi wires is restricted with consecutive limitation of the potential therapeutical benefit. Most probably these effects are caused by local alterations of the alloy composition and the length of the weld. Conclusions: Laser welding of NiTi-wires is feasible but worsens mechanical properties. Alteration of the alloy and the length of the weld seem to be the most influencing factors. The presented results suggest the application of NiTi-welding to be suitable for orthodontics, but a definite recommendation can not yet been pronounced...|$|R
40|$|Four <b>flex</b> {{circuits}} were <b>tested.</b> They are categorized as: (1) Litchfield narrow; (2) Litchfield wide; (3) Cirexx wide; and (4) Speedy Circuit green. The {{cross sectional}} area of copper was calculated from trace resistance measurements. All the flex circuits had an acceptable amount of copper cross section. about 6 e- 8 m{sup 2 } for all except the Cirexx flex which had 4. 5 e- 8 m{sup 2 }. The thickness of the ribbons was 0. 006 -inch for the Litchfield and about 0. 004 -inch for the Cirexx and Speed circuit. The room temperature resistivity ratio (RRR) {{was measured to be}} 15 for all the circuits. This was expected and means that the trace material resistivity at helium temperatures is 1 / 15 th of what it is at room temperature. This is good from the standpoint of thermal heat load. Purer copper, with an RRR > 30 would result in an unacceptable heat load. The cryogenic cycling and bending tests to liquid nitrogen proved that both the Cirexx wide and Speedy circuit green were made of acceptable materials. Both Litchfield flex circuits had significant cracking of the coverlay when bent at cold temperatures and are not acceptable. The Litchfield narrow was in bad physical condition to start with and got worse through the testing with many more crazing cracks appearing. The crazing is bad enough that the coverlay began to peel and expose the copper beneath. This candidate is unacceptable. The Litchfield wide started out testing in good condition with no cracks. It ended up with much crazing in the coverlay. Within 1 mm of the edge of the coverlay at the cold end. the copper traces were bulged away from the base material. Traces became nadhered and lifted off of the base material at the ends where the coverlay was not present. Numerous electrical opens (7 out of 24 checked) were found {{at the end of the}} testing. Visual inspection of the opens leaves open the possibility that the traces are broken below the coverlay in the cold bend area. Obviously this candidate is unacceptable. The Cirexx wide was a mechanical sample with no promises made about it's electrical integrity, however of the traces checked all were fine after the brutal <b>testing.</b> This <b>flex</b> circuit appears suitable for the intended cryogenic and mechanical environment. The Speedy circuit came out as acceptable in the testing also. The material remained flexible at cryogenic temperatures. 2 out of 24 traces were found open after the testing, but this was a mechanical sample and those traces were not checked beforehand so it is unknown if the testing caused the opens or they were there at the start. This sample was not presented as having final product electrical characteristics...|$|R
