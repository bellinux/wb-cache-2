40|$|AbstractMice {{transgenic}} for SV 40 T antigen (Tag) {{under control}} of the rat insulin promoter (RIP) develop two alternative <b>immunological</b> phenotypes: <b>tolerance</b> or autoimmunity towards Tag. We utilized the T cell receptor (TCR) genes expressed in a Tag-specific CD 4 + cell from an autoimmune RIP-Tag mouse to generate two lines of TCR transgenic mice in which either 10 % or 90 % of peripheral T cells express the transgenic TCR. when cross-bred to the tolerant RIP 1 -Tag 2 line, mice from the low frequency TCR line showed partial deletion of peripheral Tag-specific T cells and nonresponsiveness of those that remained. In contrast, crossbred mice in which transgenic T cells comprised {{a majority of the}} T cell population were nontolerant both in vivo and in vitro.

A second outcome is the development of an evanescent form of CS that results when TNP-PEC are administered under conditions that avoid rapid activation of the suppressor circuit.

40|$|Maintenance of lymphoid {{homeostasis}} in {{a number}} of immunological and inflammatory contexts is served by a variety of regulatory T (Treg) cell subtypes, and depends on interaction of the transcription factor Foxp 3 with specific transcriptional cofactors. We report that a commonly used insertional mutant of FoxP 3 (GFP-Foxp 3) modified its molecular interactions, blocking Hif 1 a but increasing Irf 4 interactions. The transcriptional profile of these Treg cells was subtly altered, with an over-representation of Irf 4 -dependent transcripts. In keeping with Irf 4 -dependent function of Treg cells to preferentially suppress T cell help to B cells and Th 2 - and Th 17 -type differentiation, GFP-Foxp 3 mice showed a divergent susceptibility to autoimmune disease; protection against antibody-mediated arthritis in the K/BxN model, but greater susceptibility to diabetes on the NOD background. Thus, specific sub-functions of Treg cells and the immune diseases they regulate can be influenced by FoxP 3 ’s molecular interactions, which result in divergent immunoregulation. The transcription factor FoxP 3 plays a central role in specifying the differentiation and function of regulatory T (Treg) cells.

This is the first report to our knowledge demonstrating the role of a specific viral gene product (HTLV-I Tax) on the expression of genes associated with Tregs (in particular, foxp 3) resulting in inhibition of Treg function.

25|$|Increasingly, {{there is}} strong {{evidence}} from mouse and human-based scientific studies of a broader diversity in CD4+ effector T helper cell subsets. Regulatory T (Treg) cells, {{have been identified as}} important negative regulators of adaptive immunity as they limit and suppresses the immune system to control aberrant immune responses to self-antigens; an important mechanism in controlling the development of autoimmune diseases. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are another distinct population of effector CD4+ T cells that develop from naive T cells post-antigen activation. Tfh cells are specialized in helping B cell humoral immunity as they are uniquely capable of migrating to follicular B cells in secondary lymphoid organs and provide them positive paracrine signals to enable the generation and recall production of high-quality affinity-matured antibodies. Similar to Tregs, Tfh cells also play a role in <b>immunological</b> <b>tolerance</b> as an abnormal expansion of Tfh cell numbers can lead to unrestricted autoreactive antibody production causing severe systemic autoimmune disorders.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + regulatory T cells (Tregs) on cancer progression {{has been demonstrated}} in {{a large number of}} preclinical models and confirmed in several types of malignancies. Neoplastic processes trigger an increase of Treg numbers in draining lymph nodes, spleen, blood, and tumors, leading to the suppression of anti-tumor responses. Treg depletion before or early in tumor development may lead to complete tumor eradication and extends survival of mice and humans. However this strategy is ineffective in established tumors, highlighting the critical role of the early Treg-tumor encounters. In this review, after discussing old and new concepts of <b>immunological</b> tumor <b>tolerance,</b> we focus on the nature (thymus-derived vs. peripherally-derived) and status (na&# 239;ve or activated / memory) of the regulatory T cells at tumor emergence. The recent discoveries in this field suggest that the activation status of Tregs and effector T cells (Teffs) at the first encounter with the tumor are essential to shape the fate and speed of the immune response across a variety of tumor models. The relative timing of activation/recruitment of antitumor cells versus tolerogenic cells at tumor emergence appears to be crucial in the identification of tumor cells as friend or foe, which has broad implications for the design of cancer immunotherapies...|$|R

40|$|Thymic T cell anergy, as {{manifested}} by thymocyte proliferative unresponsiveness to antigens {{expressed in}} the thymic environment, is commonly believed to mediate the acquisition of <b>immunological</b> self- <b>tolerance.</b> However, we previously found that thymic T cell anergy {{may lead to the}} breakdown of tolerance and predispose to autoimmunity in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Here, we show that NOD thymic T cell anergy, as revealed by proliferative unresponsiveness in vitro after stimulation through the T cell receptor (TCR), is associated with defective TCR-mediated signal transduction along the PKC/p 21 ras/p 42 mapk pathway of T cell activation. PKC activity is reduced in NOD thymocytes. Activation of p 21 ras is deficient in quiescent and stimulated NOD T cells, and this is correlated with a significant reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of p 42 mapk, a serine/threonine kinase active downstream of p 21 ras. Treatment of NOD T cells with a phorbol ester not only enhances their p 21 ras activity and p 42 mapk tyrosine phosphorylation but also restores their proliferative responsiveness. Since p 42 mapk activity is required for progression through to S phase of the cell cycle, our data suggest that reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of p 42 mapk in stimulated NOD T cells may abrogate its activity and elicit the proliferative unresponsiveness of these cells...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate how DPPIV inhibition modifies the expression of genes in the thymus of NOD mice by microarray analysis. Changes in the gene expression of β-cell autoantigens and Aire in thymic epithelial cells (TECs) were also evaluated by using qRT-PCR. A DPPIV inhibitor, MK 626, was orally administered in the diet for 4 and 6 weeks starting at 6 - 8 weeks of age. Thymic glands from treated and control mice were obtained for each study checkpoint. Thymus transcriptome analysis revealed that 58 genes were significantly over-expressed in MK 626 -treated mice after 6 weeks of treatment. Changes in gene expression in the thymus were confined mainly to the immune system, including innate immunity, chemotaxis, antigen presentation and immunoregulation.

AIM: The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate any deficiency of iNK T cells in coeliac disease. METHODS: Blood was collected from 86 subjects with coeliac disease and from 152 healthy control subjects for investigation of Valpha 24 + T cells by flow cytometry. iNK T cells were assessed by Valpha 24 and alpha-galactosylceramide/CD 1 d tetramer markers in 23 normal controls and 13 subjects with coeliac disease. Intracellular IL- 4 was measured after anti-CD 3 antibody stimulation. Duodenal biopsies were obtained in a subgroup of subjects with coeliac disease and control subjects for Valpha 24 mRNA expression using relative PCR and for Valpha 24 + T cells by immunofluorescence. RESULTS: The mean numbers of circulating Valpha 24 + T cells and iNK T cells in coeliac disease were 27 % (p< 0. 001) and 16 % (p< 0. 001), respectively, of levels in control subjects. After in vitro anti-CD 3 stimulation, numbers of IL- 4 + producing iNK T cells from subjects with coeliac disease were unchanged but increased by 21 % in control subjects. In subjects with coeliac disease, Valpha 24 mRNA intestinal expression was reduced to 17 % (p< 0. 001) by relative PCR and numbers of intestinal Valpha 24 + T cells were 16 % (p< 0. 01) of levels in control subjects.

Injection of lentiviral particles in early phases of CIA, that is, at day 7 or day 26 after CII immunisation, partially prevented development of arthritis, decreased the serum levels of CII-specific IgG antibodies, and enhanced the suppressive function of CII-specific T regulatory cells. When lentiviral particles were injected during manifest arthritis, that is, at day 31 after CII immunisation, the severity of arthritis progression was ameliorated, the levels of CII-specific IgG antibodies decreased {{and the proportion of}} T regulatory cells increased.
