50|$|Herman Daly defines {{his concept}} of a {{steady-state}} economy as an economic system {{made up of a}} constant stock of physical wealth (capital) and a constant stock of people (population), both stocks to be maintained by a flow of natural resources through the system. The first component, the constant stocks, is similar to the concept of the stationary state, originally used in classical economics; the second component, the flow of natural resources, is a new <b>ecological</b> <b>feature,</b> presently also used in the academic discipline of ecological economics. The durability of both of the constant stocks is to be maximized: The more durable the stock of capital is, the smaller the flow of natural resources is needed to maintain the stock; likewise, a 'durable' population means a population enjoying a high life expectancy — something desirable by itself — maintained by a low birth rate and an equally low death rate. Taken together, higher durability translates into better ecology in the system as a whole.|$|E

30|$|Another bi-sterigmate {{species from}} the H. setigerum complex, H. bisetigerum Boidin & Gilles, was {{described}} from Madagascar (Boidin and Gilles, [2003]). However, this species differs from H. pinicola in bearing shorter basidia, shorter basidiospores, and heavily encrusted septocystidia (see key). In the global {{survey of the}} H. setigerum complex (Nilsson et al., [2003]), the largest spores (12 – 14.5 × 4.5 – 5 μm) {{were found in the}} material from Greenland; these however are shorter than in H. pinicola. According to a detailed morphological study of H. setigerum in Belarus and northwest Russia (Yurchenko and Zmitrovich, [2001]), the largest spores do not exceed 14 μm long, with averages from 7.3 to 11.2 μm. The average spore size in H. pinicola specimens was 15.1 × 4.3 μm (holotype), 14.4 × 4.3 μm (TNM F 13635), and 14.1 × 4.5 μm (TNM F 13643).

40|$|Quantification {{of water}} table {{dynamics}} {{is an essential}} part of eco-hydrological characterisation as they are a controlling factor for vegetation and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. This is often done using the concept of groundwater depth classes, which are defined based on mean high winter and mean low summer water levels. However, this concept does not consider inter-yearly variability of groundwater levels. Also, groundwater depth classes can depend strongly on local topography, which is specially the case in dune belts in coastal regions. In this paper, the relation between groundwater depth classes and the size of seasonal and inter-yearly variations is investigated in a dune region along the Belgian coast, which has the special hydrological and <b>ecological</b> <b>feature</b> of including a dune river. The spatial pattern of the seasonal fluctuations and inter-yearly variability here is much simpler than the heterogeneous distribution of groundwater depth classes. This may provide additional useful information in relation to the occurrence of vegetation and can be used in the context of nature development programmes...|$|E

40|$|Marine {{reserves}} are becoming progressively more important as anthropogenic impacts continue to increase, {{but we have}} little baseline information for most marine environments. In this study, {{we focus on the}} Oceanic Shoals Commonwealth Marine Reserve (CMR) in northern Australia, particularly the carbonate banks and terraces of the Sahul Shelf and Van Diemen Rise which have been designated a Key <b>Ecological</b> <b>Feature</b> (KEF). We use a species-level inventory compiled from three marine surveys to the CMR to address several questions relevant to marine management: 1) Are carbonate banks and other raised geo-morphic features associated with biodiversity hotspots? 2) Can environmental (depth, sub-strate hardness, slope) or biogeographic (east vs west) variables help explain local and regional differences in community structure? 3) Do sponge communities differ among indi-vidual raised geomorphic features? Approximately 750 sponge specimens were collected in the Oceanic Shoals CMR and assigned to 348 species, of which only 18 % included taxo-nomically described species. Between eastern and western areas of the CMR, {{there was no difference between}} sponge species richness or assemblages on raised geomorphic fea...|$|E
40|$|Forest canopy {{analysis}} in the Alpine environment: comparison among assessment methods. Forest canopy is an important <b>ecological</b> <b>feature</b> of forest stands and can be expressed as Leaf Area Index (LAI) or canopy cover percentage. LAI is the ratio between leaf area and ground area (m 2 m- 2) {{and it can be}} measured using an angle of 180 °. Instead, the canopy cover is the percentage of forest area occupied by the vertical projection of tree crowns; consequently, LAI expresses the canopy closure rather than the canopy cover. This paper focuses on the estimation of LAI and canopy cover percentage in 54 sampling points randomly distributed over the main forest types of Trentino (beech forests, Scots pine forests, Norway spruce forests and European larch forests). The main purpose was the analysis of relationship between LAI and canopy cover percentage, the latter measured with two different techniques: visual estimation and estimation using the spherical densiometer. In {{the last part of the}} paper, LAI data collected in the four main forest types of Trentino are compared with values reported in the literature for the same forest types...|$|E
40|$|In {{our study}} of Station ALOHA, a site {{representative}} of the oligotrophic North Pacific subtropical gyre (NPSG), alkenone content and composition were examined in 1) sinking particulate materials collected in sediment traps moored at 2800 m during two, year-long deployments (1992 - 93 and 2000 - 01) and 2) suspended particulate materials collected throughout the euphotic zone in two contrasting seasons (winter and summer). Each year, sediment trap records documented pronounced alkenone export events in both seasons. The winter event appears triggered by eddy diffusive mixing of nutrients into the upper water column {{and the release of}} light limitation on alkenone-producing photoautotrophs growing in the deep chlorophyll maximum layer (DCML). The summer event originates apparently from a stratified euphotic depth well above the DCML where others have now documented the occurrence of N 2 fixation-based new production. Although our time series record is yet limited, {{it is likely that the}} absolute magnitude of alkenone export and its quantitative importance in winter relative to summer is an <b>ecological</b> <b>feature</b> of the NPSG which can oscillate significantly on decadal time scales in response to climatic forcing.

40|$|Only {{about one}} third of humans possess a {{microbiota}} capable of transforming the dietary isoflavone daidzein into equol. Little {{is known about the}} dietary and physiological factors determining this <b>ecological</b> <b>feature.</b> In this study, the in vitro metabolism of daidzein by faecal samples from four human individuals was investigated. One culture produced the metabolites dihydrodaidzein and O-desmethylangolensin, another produced dihydrodaidzein and equol. From the latter, a stable and transferable mixed culture transforming daidzein into equol was obtained. Molecular fingerprinting analysis (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) showed the presence of four bacterial species of which only the first three strains could be brought into pure culture. These strains were identified as Lactobacillus mucosae EPI 2, Enterococcus faecium EPI 1 and Finegoldia magna EPI 3, and did not produce equol in pure culture. The fourth species was tentatively identified as Veillonella sp strain EP. It was found that hydrogen gas in particular, but also butyrate and propionate, which are all colonic fermentation products from poorly digestible carbohydrates, stimulated equol production by the mixed culture. However, when fructo-oligosaccharides were added, equol production was inhibited. Furthermore, the equol-producing capacity of the isolated culture was maintained upon its addition to a faecal culture originating from a non-equol-producing individual...|$|E
40|$|Environmental stress {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{to be a major}} evolutionary force, both through inducing strong selection and because of its direct impact on developmental buffering processes that alter the evolvability of organisms. In particular, temperature has attracted much attention because of its importance as an <b>ecological</b> <b>feature</b> and the relative ease with which it can be exper-imentally manipulated in the lab. Evolution Canyon, Lower Nahal Oren, Israel, is a well studied natural site where ecological parameters are suspected to drive evolutionary differentiation. In this study, using Drosophila melanogaster isofemale lines derived from wild flies collected on both slopes of the canyon, we investigated the effect of developmental temperature upon the different components of phenotypic variation of a complex trait: the wing. Combining geometric and traditional morpho-metrics, we find only limited evidence for a differentiation among slopes. Investigating simultaneously phenotypic plasticity, genetic variation among isofemale lines, variation among individuals and fluctuating asymmetry, we could not identify a consistent effect of the stressful conditions encountered on the south facing slope. The prevailing structuring effect is that of the experimentally manipulated temperature which clearly influences wing mean size and shape. Variability, in contrast, is not consistently affected by temperature. Finally, we investigated the specific relationship between individual variation and fluctuating asymmetry. Using metric multi-dimensional scaling we show that the related patterns of wing shape variation ar...|$|E
40|$|The Albian amber of Archingeay (Charente-Maritime, SW France) shows {{a unique}} <b>ecological</b> <b>feature</b> among {{worldwide}} Cretaceous ambers: {{a large part}} of the arthropods trapped in this resin are representatives of the litter biota (i. e. the fauna living on the ground surface). This selective trap sampled the in situ fauna, important for the knowledge of the Early Cretaceous forest ecosystem. This exceptional fossilization could be explained by an important fluidity of the resin, which allowed flows from the branches or the trunk to directly contact the soil, instantaneously entrapping organisms crawling on the soil surface as well as the associated plant remains. The plant source of the resin was probably a member of the Araucariaceae, as suggested by SEM analysis of both plant remains trapped in the resin and the abundant lignite associated with the amber in the same strata. This litter-bearing amber exhibits a high diversity of taxa, encompassing 14 of 21 arthropod groups included in this resin: Isopoda, Myriapoda, Acari, Araneae, Pseudoscorpionida, Collembola, Blattodea, Psocoptera, Coleoptera, Homoptera, Heteroptera, Orthoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera. In addition to a unique insight into the diversity of a Cretaceous subtropical forest floor, this litter fauna provides valuable paleoclimatic data for the west European Albian coast, suggesting xeric conditions with a probable dry season within the globally warm and wet period of the mid-Cretaceous...|$|E
