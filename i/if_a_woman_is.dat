25|$|Sharī'ah law {{addresses}} {{domestic violence}} through {{the concept of}} darar or harm that encompasses several types of abuse against a spouse, including physical abuse. The laws concerning darar state that <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> being harmed in her marriage, she can have it annulled: physically assaulting a wife violates the marriage contract and is grounds for immediate divorce.|$|E
25|$|A forced {{marriage}} {{qualifies as a}} form of human trafficking in certain situations. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> sent abroad, forced into the marriage and then repeatedly compelled to engage in sexual conduct with her new husband, then her experience is that of sex trafficking. If the bride is treated as a domestic servant by her new husband and/or his family, then this is a form of labor trafficking.|$|E

25|$|Women {{are allowed}} to work in Islam, subject to certain conditions, such as <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> in {{financial}} need and her employment does not cause her to neglect her important role as a mother and wife. It has been claimed {{that it is the}} responsibility of the Muslim community to organize work for women, so that she can do so in a Muslim cultural atmosphere, where her rights (as set out in the Quran) are respected. Islamic law however, permits women to work in Islamic conditions, such as the work not requiring the woman to violate Islamic law (e.g., serving alcohol), and that she maintain her modesty while she performs any work outside her home.|$|E
25|$|The FDA has {{classified}} the HPV vaccine as {{a pregnancy}} Category B, meaning {{there is no}} apparent harm to the fetus in animal studies. HPV vaccines have not been causally related with adverse pregnancy outcomes or adverse effects on the fetus. However, data on vaccination during pregnancy is very limited and vaccination during the pregnancy term should be delayed until more information is available. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> found to be pregnant during the three-dose series of vaccination, the series will be postponed until pregnancy has been completed. While {{there is no indication}} for intervention for vaccine dosages administered during pregnancy, patients and health-care providers are encouraged to report exposure to vaccines to the appropriate HPV vaccine pregnancy registry.|$|E
500|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} may involve only the lower urinary tract, in which case it {{is known as a}} bladder infection. [...] Alternatively, it may involve the upper urinary tract, in which case it is known as pyelonephritis. If the urine contains significant bacteria but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria. If a {{urinary tract infection}} involves the upper tract, and the person has diabetes mellitus, is pregnant, is male, or immunocompromised, it is considered complicated. Otherwise <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> healthy and premenopausal it is considered uncomplicated. In children when a urinary tract infection is associated with a fever, it is deemed to be an upper urinary tract infection.|$|E
50|$|From {{the times}} of the ancient Egyptians, cases of {{mortuary}} neglect have been recorded. The process of embalming is to preserve the dead for burial, as the Egyptians believed the afterlife was {{just as important as}} life itself. However, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> married to <b>an</b> embalmer, he would likely keep her preserved for his own benefit until obvious decomposition took place.|$|R
5|$|He {{passed laws}} to protect prostitutes from {{exploitation}} {{and women from}} being forced into prostitution. Rapists were treated severely. Further, by his policies: women charged with major crimes should be guarded by other women to prevent sexual abuse; <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>was</b> widowed, her dowry should be returned; and a husband could not take on a major debt without his wife giving her consent twice.|$|R
50|$|According {{to church}} policy, after {{a man has}} died, he may be sealed by proxy {{to all of the}} women to whom he was legally married while he was alive.

500|$|There {{are clear}} gender {{divisions}} among the Betsimisaraka. When traveling by {{foot in a}} mixed gender group, it is forbidden for women to walk before men. [...] Women are traditionally the ones to act as porters, carrying light items {{on the head and}} heavy items on the back; <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> present, it is considered ridiculous for a man to carry something. [...] When eating, men use a single spoon to fill their plates from the communal bowl and to eat the food on their plates, whereas women are required to use two separate spoons to fill their plates and to eat. Men are generally responsible for tilling the rice fields, obtaining food, gathering firewood and building the family home and furniture, and they engage in discussion and debate about public affairs. Women's tasks include growing crops, weeding the rice fields and harvesting and processing the rice, fetching water, lighting the hearth fire and preparing daily meals, and weaving.|$|E
2500|$|Dietary {{restriction}} and supplementation are {{key measures}} taken in several well-known metabolic disorders, including galactosemia, phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease, organic acidurias and urea cycle disorders. [...] Such restrictive diets {{can be difficult}} for the patient and family to maintain, and require close consultation with a nutritionist who has special experience in metabolic disorders. [...] The composition of the diet will change depending on the caloric needs of the growing child and special attention is needed during a pregnancy <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> affected with one of these disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Regular menstrual cycles are {{sometimes}} taken {{as evidence that}} a woman is ovulating normally, and irregular cycles as evidence she is not. [...] However, many women with irregular cycles do ovulate normally, and some with regular cycles are actually annovulatory or have a luteal phase defect. Records of basal body temperatures, especially, but also of cervical mucus and position, {{can be used to}} accurately determine <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> ovulating, and if the length of the post-ovulatory (luteal) phase of her menstrual cycle is sufficient to sustain a pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|Anglo-Saxons had {{warnings}} {{for pregnant}} women, including avoiding foods {{that were too}} salty or sweet, pork, and other fatty foods. They were also told to abstain from strong alcohol and too much drink and to avoid travel on horseback. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>were</b> to stop menstruating supposedly {{due to a lack}} of nutrients and was not pregnant, she was to take hot baths, drink hot herb teas, and dress warmly.|$|R
50|$|There is {{controversy}} as to {{how they}} came into being and in some tales the Maras are simply restless children, whose souls leave their body at night to haunt the living. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>were</b> to have <b>a</b> horse placenta pulled over her head before giving birth, the children would be delivered safely; but all the boys will turn into werewolves, and all the girls will become Maras.|$|R
40|$|On average, the {{menopause}} {{occurs at}} the age of 50 years, 1 with 1 % of women continuing to menstruate beyond the age of 60 years and 1 % whose menopause occurs before 40 years. Arbitrarily, a menopause before the age of 40 years is defined as 'premature'. Premature ovarian failure may be caused by any process which reduces the number of oocytes within the ovary. In the embryo, germ cells first appear in the urogenital ridge. These germ cells then migrate to the primitive ovary. Once within the ovary, the germ cells multiply to form 3. 5 million potential oocytes in each ovary (Fig. 1). From this time, oocytes are held in suspended animation- meiosis- until required for ovulation perhaps 40 years later. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>were</b> to ovulate every month throughout her reproductive life, then she would use fewer than 500 eggs- a tiny proportion of the original 7 million (0. 007 %). Thus, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>were</b> to prevent ovulation, say by taking the combined oral contraceptiv...|$|R
2500|$|It is not {{necessary}} to know a person well or be intimate with them to kiss them on the cheek. When introduced to someone new by a mutual acquaintance in social settings, it is customary to greet him or her with a cheek kiss if the person being introduced to them {{is a member of the}} opposite sex or <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> introduced to another woman. [...] If the person is a complete stranger, i.e. self-introductions, no kissing is done. A cheek kiss may be accompanied by a hug or another sign of physical affection. [...] In business settings, the cheek kiss is not always standard upon introduction, but once a relationship is established, it is common practice.|$|E
2500|$|Pregnant {{women who}} are {{positive}} for Hashimoto's thyroiditis may have decreased thyroid function or the gland may fail entirely. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> TPOAb-positive, clinicians can inform her of the risks {{for themselves and their}} infants if they go untreated. [...] "Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) are detected in 10% of pregnant women," [...] which presents risks to those pregnancies. Women who have low thyroid function that has not been stabilized are at greater risk of having an infant with: low birth weight, neonatal respiratory distress, hydrocephalus, hypospadias, miscarriage, and preterm delivery. The embryo transplantion rate and successful pregnancy outcomes are improved when Hashimoto's is treated. Recommendations are to only treat pregnant {{women who are}} TPOAb-positive throughout the entirety of their pregnancies and to screen all pregnant women for thyroid levels. Close cooperation between the endocrinologist and obstetrician benefits the woman and the infant. The Endocrine Society recommends screening in pregnant women who are considered high-risk for thyroid autoimmune disease.|$|E

50|$|The Reverend Samuel Marsden {{categorized}} {{the women}} convicts into being married or prostitutes. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>were</b> to have <b>a</b> relationship out of wedlock, Marsden considered this whoredom. Many couples lived and cohabited together monogamously without being officially married, yet these <b>women</b> <b>were</b> recorded as being prostitutes.
