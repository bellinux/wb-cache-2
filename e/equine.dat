40|$|A {{recent study}} {{reported}} neutralizing antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) in horses from four ranches of southern Pantanal. To extend that study, a serosurvey for WNV and 11 Brazilian flaviviruses {{was conducted with}} 760 <b>equines,</b> 238 sheep and 61 caimans from 17 local cattle ranches. Among the tested <b>equines,</b> 32 were collected from a ranch where a neurologic disorder outbreak had been recently reported. The sera were initially screened by using a blocking ELISA and then titrated by 90 % plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT 90) for 12 flaviviruses. Employing the criterion of 4 -fold greater titer, 78 (10. 3 %) <b>equines</b> were seropositive for Ilheus virus, 59 (7. 8 %) for Saint Louis encephalitis virus, 24 (3. 2 %) for WNV, two (0. 3 %) for Cacipacore virus and one (0. 1 %) for Rocio virus. No serological evidence was found linking the neurological disease that affected local <b>equines</b> to WNV. All caimans and sheep were negative by blocking ELISA for flaviviruses. There were no seropositive <b>equines</b> for Bussuquara, Iguape, Yellow fever and all four Dengue virus serotypes.

40|$|The {{region of}} esophagus-gastric {{transition}} of <b>equines</b> was studied since distinct factors can cause injuries {{in this region}} {{as well as in}} the glandular region of the stomach of these animals. The objective of this work was to identify whether different types of physical and alimentary handling determine alterations in the macroscopic structure of the region of esophagus-gastric transition of the <b>equines.</b> We used 15 sets consisting of the regions of esophagus-gastric transition of adult <b>equines</b> whose race, sex and age were unidentified, divided into three groups in accordance with the diet and developed physical activity: Group I, five sets of <b>equines</b> in intensive training and fed mainly on the basis of concentrate; Group II, five sets of <b>equines</b> that did not engage in intense physical activity and were fed mainly on the basis of concentrate; and Group III with five sets of <b>equines</b> kept on pasture that did not engage in intense physical activity. The results showed that the staining of the mucosa, as well as the wall thickness of the region of transition, varied among groups. Gastric ulcers were found in all the groups studied, but most of them were identified in the transitions of the <b>equines</b> of Group II. The study concludes that no correlation existed between the macroscopic diet/physical activity and the presence of ulcers in the wall of esophagus-gastric transition of the <b>equines...</b>|$|R
5|$|While the {{domestic}} horse and donkey (along with their feral descendants) exist worldwide, wild <b>equine</b> populations {{are limited to}} Africa and Asia. Wild <b>equine</b> social systems come in two forms; a harem system with tight-knit groups consisting of one adult male or stallion, several females or mares and their young or foals; and a territorial system where males establish territories with resources that attract females, which associate very fluidly. In both systems, females {{take care of their}} offspring but males may play a role as well. Equines communicate with each other both visually and vocally. Human activities have threatened wild <b>equine</b> populations and out of the seven living species, only the plains zebra remains widespread and abundant.|$|E
5|$|<b>Equine</b> hooves {{and legs}} have evolved over {{millions}} of years to the form in which they are found today. The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe, while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones. Prairie-dwelling <b>equine</b> species developed hooves and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food. Forest-dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling <b>equine</b> species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{finished}} with a racing career that are not suitable for breeding purposes often become riding horses or other <b>equine</b> companions.

5|$|In two instances, the equestrian {{portion of}} the Olympics has been held in a {{different}} location {{from the rest of}} the games. The first was during the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia when, due to Australian quarantine laws, the equestrian portion was held in Stockholm, Sweden. At the next IOC meeting, it was decided to hold a special Equestrian Olympic Games several months before the actual Olympics, complete with its own opening and closing ceremonies. This meant that Switzerland, which had officially boycotted the 1956 Games because of the Soviet Union's recent invasion of Hungary, still brought home a medal because of its participation in the equestrian portion several months earlier. The second instance was during the 2008 Summer Olympics, when the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing. This decision was made when, in 2005, international veterinary groups refused to certify the main Olympic city as free of <b>equine</b> diseases. This would have resulted in horses leaving Beijing after the games and having to go through lengthy quarantine processes before being allowed to re-enter their home countries. Hong Kong also had the benefit of having better facilities, including a top <b>equine</b> hospital and one of only a few <b>equine</b> drug-testing labs in the world.|$|E

5|$|Rhabdomyolysis is {{recognized}} in horses. Horses {{can develop a}} number of muscle disorders, many of which may progress to rhabdomyolysis. Of these, some cause isolated attacks of rhabdomyolysis (e.g., dietary deficiency in vitamin E and selenium, poisoning associated with pasture or agricultural poisons such as organophosphates), while others predispose to exertional rhabdomyolysis (e.g., the hereditary condition <b>equine</b> polysaccharide storage myopathy). 5–10% of thoroughbred horses and some standardbred horses suffer from the condition <b>equine</b> exertional rhabdomyolysis; no specific cause has been identified, but an underlying muscle calcium regulation disorder is suspected.|$|E

5|$|The Appaloosa is an American horse breed {{best known}} for its {{colorful}} spotted coat pattern. There is a wide range of body types within the breed, stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history. Each horse's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors. The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study <b>equine</b> coat color genetics, as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation (LP). Appaloosas are prone to develop <b>equine</b> recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex.|$|E
5|$|A dun-colored {{coat with}} {{primitive}} markings {{that include a}} dorsal stripe and often leg striping and transverse shoulder stripes reflect the wildtype coat and are observed in most wild extant <b>equine</b> species. Only the mountain zebra lacks a dorsal stripe. In domestic horses, dun color and primitive markings exist in some animals across many breeds. The purpose of the bold black-and-white striping of zebras has been a subject of debate among biologists for over a century, but recent (2014) evidence supports the theory {{that they are a}} form of protection from biting flies. These insects appear to be less attracted to striped coats and, compared to other wild equines, zebras live in areas with the highest fly activity. With the exception of the domestic horses, which have long manes that lay over the neck and long tail hair growing {{from the top of the}} tailhead or dock, most equines have erect manes and long tails ending in a tuft of hair. The coats of some <b>equine</b> species undergo shedding in certain parts of their range and are thick in the winter.|$|E
5|$|Horses require routine {{hoof care}} from a farrier, {{as well as}} vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental {{examinations}} from a veterinarian or a specialized <b>equine</b> dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming {{is also helpful to}} help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.|$|E

5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of <b>equine</b> corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as <b>equine</b> ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with <b>equine</b> influenza, ringworm, sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E
5|$|Wild <b>equines</b> {{may spend}} seven {{hours a day}} sleeping. During the day, they sleep {{standing}} up while at night they lie down. They regularly rub against trees, rocks and other objects and roll in around in dust for protection against flies and irritation. Except the mountain zebra, wild <b>equines</b> can roll over completely.|$|R
50|$|Epizootic subtypes, on {{the other}} hand, can spread rapidly through large populations. These forms of the virus are highly {{pathogenic}} to <b>equines</b> and can also affect human health. <b>Equines,</b> rather than rodents, are the primary animal species that carry and spread the disease. Infected <b>equines</b> develop an enormous quantity of virus in their circulatory system. When a blood-feeding insect feeds on such animals, it picks up this virus and transmits it to other animals or humans. Although other animals, such as cattle, swine, and dogs, can become infected, they generally do not show signs of the disease or contribute to its spread.|$|R
40|$|<b>Equines</b> {{play a role}} in the {{epidemiology}} of Brazilian {{spotted fever}} (BSF) since they are a primary host for the tick Amblyomma sculptum. We studied the seroprevalence for three species of Rickettsia in <b>equines</b> in four endemic (with human cases) and in four non-endemic areas (no human cases) in the Piracicaba River Basin, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A serological survey of 504 <b>equines</b> was performed: around 63 animals were sampled in each area and tested through indirect immunofluorescence assay for R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, and R. bellii in 2012 - 2013. Blood samples were seropositive for 183 <b>equines</b> (36. 3 %) in which 73 (39. 9 %) were from non-endemic areas. In the studied sites <b>equines</b> were highly exposed to Rickettsia infection ranging from 6. 1 % to 54. 7 %, with Geometric Mean Titers greater in endemic area (p = 0. 012). Results suggest that Rickettsia may be more widespread than the surveillance of BSF has detected. These results highlight the need to include data on the seroprevalence of sentinel animals to improve human diagnoses and surveillance in areas with no reported human cases...|$|R
