40|$|A Dutch {{pilot study}} of <b>fully</b> <b>documented</b> <b>fisheries</b> {{provided}} {{the opportunity to}} observe actual changes in fishing behaviour under catch quota management (CQM). Interviews with fishers in the pilot study aided in interpreting the results and giving insight in the decision making process and reasoning of fishers. The CQM pilot study entailed a fleet of small and large demersal vessels. For these vessels, all cod catches were counted against quota, including catches of individuals below minimum landings size. To obtain reliable catch data all vessels were equipped with electronic monitoring (EM) systems. These systems recorded videos of all fishing and processing activities on board. In return, fishers received a 30 % quota bonus for cod and were compensated with more flexibility on effort regulations. It was hypothesized that vessels in the CQM will (i) increase their landings by 30 % according to their quota bonus, (ii) increase the use of gear with large mesh size, and (iii) change effort towards fishing locations with high catch rates of large cod and avoid areas with high catch rates of undersized cod. The results showed that CQM {{had no effect on}} fishing behaviour of the small vessels. In contrast, large vessels significantly increased their cod landings (216 %) and avoided undersized cod. This difference in response of different fleets suggested that implementation of CQM, for instance {{in the context of the}} European Common Fisheries Policy, should consider fleet characteristics. It seemed that larger vessels in this study more easily adapted their behaviour to new management regimes and that the quota bonus opened up new fishing strategies, that were not envisaged during the implementation. </p...|$|E

Compiled by Stefani J. Evers and Ann L. Shriver. International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade (IIFET), Corvallis, 2016. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Biennial Conference of the International Institute of Fisheries Economics and Trade, held July 11 - 15, 2016 at Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Center (AECC), Aberdeen, Scotland, UK. A general discard ban is {{currently}} being introduced within the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union.  The gradual implementation of this landing obligation (LO) started {{in the beginning of}} 2015 and is to apply to all fisheries within the EU by the beginning of year 2019. A major challenge related with the implementation of the LO is how to deal with unavoidable, unwanted catches (UUC) on-board fishing vessels and how to establish applicable incentives or enforcement mechanisms to ensure that UUC are landed. The focus on UUC on-board fishing vessels within EU has mainly been on monitoring, control and surveillance, where <b>Fully</b> <b>Documented</b> <b>Fisheries</b> have been at the forefront. There has however not been much attention given to what can be done with the unwanted catches once they have been taken aboard the fishing vessels. This paper addresses these challenges, identifying available alternatives and technologies, as well as their applicability within selected EU fisheries. The paper also identifies solutions already in use in fisheries with long and successful experiences of discard bans. A key component in implementing a successful discard ban is either to establish monetary incentives to land UUC or efficient enforcement mechanisms. Both alternatives have been applied in different fisheries with variable success, providing important lessons that need to be taken into consideration {{within the context of the}} CFP discard ban...|$|E
40|$|STECF EWG 13 - 06 {{notes that}} it has {{extensively}} addressed the ToR regarding the requested fishing effort regime evaluations in the 11. Eastern and Western Baltic, 12. the Kattegat, 13. the Skagerrak, North Sea, European waters in ICES Div. 2 and the Eastern Channel, 14. to the West of Scotland, 15. Irish Sea, 16. Celtic Sea, 17. Atlantic waters off the Iberian Peninsula, 18. Western Channel, 19. Western Waters and Deep Sea 20. and the Bay of Biscay, i. e. updated estimates of trends in fishing effort, landings and discards by species, CPUE and LPUE by fisheries and species, and partial fishing mortalities for effort regulated and non-regulated fisheries by Member States. Few ToR could not be accomplished due to time constraints and/or data deficiencies and will be accomplished during the forthcoming STECF EWG 13 - 13 fishing effort regime evaluations part 2 (7 - 11 October 2013, Barza d’Ispra, Italy). Outstanding ToRs are those dealing with the requested comparative analyses regarding cod and sole selectivity of <b>fully</b> <b>documented</b> <b>fisheries</b> (FDF) and fisheries not participating in FDF schemes, detailed evaluations of the national implementation as regards fishing effort derogations granted under the provisions of article 13 of the new cod plan (Counc. Reg. No 1342 / 2008), as well as spatio-temporal patterns in cod catchability. STECF EWG 13 - 06 tasks have been supported by the DCF fishing effort data call in 2013. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes a general improvement in data completeness and quality as well as compliance with dead lines regarding Member States’ data provisions. However, STECF EWG 13 - 06 suffered again from delays, incompleteness and erroneous data submissions and re-submissions. Details about the DCF data call definitions, data quality in 2013 and significant shortfalls as identified by JRC and the experts contributing to the working group are summarized in section 4. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that its recommendations in 2012 to amend the 2013 DCF data call to support fishing effort regime evaluation have been implemented and that these changes have supported and will support the accomplishment of specific ToR. STECF EWG 13 - 06 noted that the DCF data call in 2013 required re-submissions of re-aggregated data {{in addition to the}} re-quested data update for 2012, which implied additional workload for the national institutions involved in the DCF framework. Notably Denmark, Portugal and UK (without Scotland) have revised their complete time series of fisheries specific catch and effort data. Spanish data were made available for 2012 and discard data were inserted to earlier data submissions to support the effort regime evaluation for Southern hake and Nephrops. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that ICES (WGMIXFISH 2013) has undertaken a detailed comparison of the 2011 ICES fisheries data received in 2013 and the 2011 STECF DCF effort data received and compiled in 2012. While the fisheries specific data on landings and nominal effort are found highly consistent, the ICES estimates of discards were consistently higher than the estimates of discards provided in the STECF data base. The pronounced differences in discard estimates are mainly due to different raising procedures applied and shall be further analysed in order to identify best and consistent practices applied to discard raising (section 4. 12). STECF EWG 13 - 06, in response to the general increased interest in discard estimates, has proposed an Index of Discard Coverage DQI to facilitate the use of the discard estimates provided in the STECF data bases on fisheries specific catch and fishing effort and obtained through the 2013 DCF data call. The DQI allows identification and avoidance of the use of discard estimates by fisheries based on the proportion of sums of national landings covered by discard estimates in relation to the overall sums of national landings. The method to derive the DQI and the interpretation of the results are provided in section 4. 5 of the present report. STECF EWG 13 - 06 notes that all resulting fisheries parameters of various fishing effort regimes are downloadable at the requested aggregation in the format of digital Appendixes to the present report at the working group’s web page: [URL] Major findings regarding the regional fishing effort regime evaluations as derived by STECF EWG 13 - 06 are summarized in the following sections, specifically for each of the reviews undertaken and covering new or additional ToR as appropriate...|$|E
