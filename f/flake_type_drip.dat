30|$|The {{effect of}} the helix angle of a router bit on chip {{formation}} and electric energy per volume (specific energy) under different feed speeds and cutting depths during the milling of maple and China fir by a computer numerically controlled (CNC) router was investigated. The peripheral cutting edge of router bits were custom-made at helix angles of 0 °, 2 °, 4 °, 6 °, and 8 °. The feed speed varied from 600 to 4800 mm/min, and the depths of cut were set at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 mm. The chips were classified by sieving into a <b>flake</b> <b>type,</b> a splinter type (5 and 10 mesh), a flow type (20 and 40 mesh), and a granule type (< 40 mesh). As the feed speed and the cutting depth increased for the five router bits, more chips of the <b>flake</b> <b>type</b> and the splinter type were produced. However, the number of granule-type chips under the larger helix angle was reduced. The energy per volume removed (specific energy) increased with the feed speed {{and the depth of}} cut while milling maple and China fir. More specific energy per cubic centimeter was consumed under the lower feed speeds and the smaller depth of cut. The specific energy can be expressed as a negative power function of the feed speed or the cutting depth for maple and China fir.|$|R

However advantageous this method, there are still some difficulties in projecting the efficiency of such systems. Most especially, determination of the losses because of the emitters is very important in order to set up an efficient irrigation system. This study is focused on determining head losses for agricultural drip irrigation systems with cylindrical in-line <b>type</b> <b>drip</b> emitters using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. In the study, three-dimensional solid models of five in-line <b>type</b> <b>drip</b> emitters, which have a volumetric flow capacity of 4. 0 [l h- 1] and placed in a pipe with 250 [mm] intervals between each other, were considered and CFD analyses were carried out with different inlet pressure values. According to the results of the CFD analyses, hydraulic losses were calculated globally and locally and analysis outputs were presented to determine the head losses due to the inclusion of the emitters. Validations for results of the simulation were also achieved by using empirical equations taken from related literature. As a result, maximum simulation error rate of 8. 824 [%] was observed between simulations and empirical equations taken from related literature results. This accordance between simulation and empirical results can be interpreted that CFD analyses could be used to calculate the critical flow parameters such as total head losses of drip irrigation pipes integrated with in-line emitters...|$|R

40|$|Diagnostic flake {{analysis}} {{is based on}} the concept that distinct flintknapping techniques produce distinctive flakes. Seen in this light, the information potential of flakes is enormous. Unfortunately, this information is virtually lost in analyses based upon size-grading a flake assemblage or separating flakes statistically based on a few "key" attributes. The intent {{of this study is to}} provide and apply a well-integrated analytical approach based upon the diagnostic flake concept. In order to integrate the static lithic artifacts to the dynamic behavior that produced them, a generalized flow chart model of the knapping event is developed. The flow chart model emphasizes the debitage produced during knapping, rather than finished lithic tools. The flow chart model is described in detail, and the terms"technology", "strategy", and "techniques" are defined and contrasted. A total of 30 reduction experiments were conducted in the course of this study, producing an estimated 27, 000 flakes and flake fragments. Based on this sample and previous work conducted by Flenniken (n. d.) and others, nine diagnostic <b>flake</b> <b>types</b> and three significant flake attributes are defined. An ideal methodology for a lithic {{analysis is}} developed. This ideal methodology includes: 1) assessing the types of raw materials present on a site; 2) reconstructing the technology based on negative-flake scars on finished tools; 3) flake refitting; 4) classifying flakes into the diagnostic flake categories nonstatistically and polythetically, with special emphasis placed on recognizing previously unidentified diagnostic flake types; 5) developing a flow chart model of reconstructed prehistoric technology; and 6) summarizing the flow chart i n verbal form. The methodology is applied to the Middle and Late Woodland components of the stratified All Seasons site located in central Indiana. Analysis of the Middle Woodland assemblage results in the recognition and definition of conical core flake blanks. The methodology is applied to a blind test manufactured by Donald Cochran to assess bias that may have been introduced into the <b>flake</b> <b>type</b> definitions by using debitage produced only by the author. Cochran's behavior is accurately reconstructed. Finally, the results of the study are discussed, and the study's strengths and weaknesses are determined.

40|$|Three-dimensional (3 -D) flower-like shape (FLS) Fe 3 O 4 and Fe {{particles}} {{were successfully}} synthesized using FLS precursor particles that are prepared through a facile microwave-assisted reaction. The mechanism underlying the self-assembly process and shape evolution of FLS particles was systematically investigated by changing reaction parameters such as reaction temperature, reaction time and reaction pressure. During the reaction, iron alkoxide, α-Fe 2 O 3 and FeOOH nanoparticles are formed first and are subsequently transformed to 3 -D hierarchical FLS particles by the self-assembly {{of the primary}} nanoparticles. Reaction temperature and pressure play critical roles {{in the formation of}} the hierarchical flower-like superstructure. There is an optimum window of the reaction temperature ([similar] 180 °C) for the formation of 3 -D FLS particles, which is attributed to the competition between the self-assembly process and growth process of the nanoparticles. Also, since FeCl 3, ethylene glycol, and urea are used together as raw materials, the appearance of FLS particles is strongly dependent on the reaction pressure. As the reaction pressure becomes larger than 1 MPa, the <b>flake</b> <b>type</b> particles become more thermodynamically favorable than the FLS particles, due to the limited decomposition of urea. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis shows that FLS particles have a large surface area (> 40 m 2 g− 1). Because of their high specific surface area and intrinsic reactivity, FLS particles efficiently remove sulfur ions in aqueous solution. This suggests that these flower-like particles can be promising materials to treat toxic gas such as H 2 S in an environment-friendly way...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{analyses}} of stone tool assemblages face {{a number of}} methodological challenges. Aside from determining specific uses, {{it can be difficult}} to know which artifacts in an assemblage were used at all. Typically retouch is taken as a proxy for indicating past use, but ignoring unretouched flakes means excluding the overwhelming majority of most assemblages. Assessing whether an unretouched flake has been used is complicated. Edge damage on flakes can be caused by use or by taphonomic processes. One of the more important of these processes is trampling. Experiments have shown that trampling can create damage mimicking retouch, and unlike some other taphonomic processes trampling is otherwise difficult to detect. One possible solution is to look for patterning in the placement (left vs. right, ventral vs. dorsal, proximal vs. distal) of edge damage, and recent studies using GIS based approaches have shown the utility of this method at an assemblage level. Here we trampled a set of experimental flakes made from two raw materials on two substrate types and analyzed the edge damage patterns using a newly developed image analysis program that is similar to previous GIS based approaches. We found that a previously unquantified variable, edge angle, is strongly correlated with the likelihood of damage. Thus in circumstances where edge angles are non-randomly distributed across <b>flake</b> <b>types,</b> trampling damage will be patterned. These results have implications for previously published edge damage studies, and further indicate that basic flake mechanics need to be considered in studies where function is inferred from edge damage patterns. Approaches to the archaeological record that employs assemblage level assessments of edge damage, must consider a range of factors when inferring behaviors from these patterns...|$|R

The effect of these management practices on the emission of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) from vineyards is not well understood and most prior studies were short-term (< 1 year). To investigate longer-term effects, a {{study was conducted in}} grape (Vitus vinifera L. cv. Merlot planted in a sandy loam soil in British Columbia, Canada. The experiment was a factorial treatment design consisting of two micro-irrigation <b>types</b> (<b>Drip</b> or Micro-sprinkler), two nitrogen sources (surface applied Compost or fertigated Urea at a rate of 40 kgNha− 1), and two vineyard floor managements (bark Mulch or “Clean”—meaning bare soil). Frequent measurements of N 2 O flux and soil and environmental variables were made over two complete years (2013 and 2014). A considerable portion (37 % in 2013 and 61 % in 2014) of the annual cumulative N 2 O emission (ΣN 2 O) occurred during the pre-growing season particularly within the thaw period. In 2013, the annual area-scaled ΣN 2 O emissions for Drip was ≈ 1. 8 ×Micro-sprinkler, Urea was ≈ 1. 5 ×Compost and Clean was ≈ 1. 7 ×Mulch. In 2014, ΣN 2 O emissions were over 14 % higher, likely due to more freeze–thaw events, higher soil mineral N availability (47 % higher), but treatments differences were not significantly different. Analysed over two years, micro-sprinkler reduced growing season emissions by 29 % and surface application of bark mulch decreased annual area-scaled and yield-scaled ΣN 2 O emissions by 28 % and 23 %, respectively, suggesting bark mulch as a strategy for mitigating N 2 O emission. The observed interannual variability in the total N 2 O emissions suggests that at least a minimum of 2 years of continuous study may be required to estimate representative annual N 2 O emission budgets and to recommend N 2 O mitigation strategies in vineyard systems...|$|R

The work focused on the historic component, representing the late-nineteenth- to early twentieth-century farmstead of the African American Rubin Hancock family, but many prehistoric artifacts were recovered as well. In 1998, TxDOT contracted with Prewitt and Associates, Inc., to complete the analysis, report production, and curation requirements for the mitigation work on both the prehistoric and historic components. This volume discusses the prehistoric component. Study of the prehistoric materials had five primary goals. The first was to produce an inventory of the artifacts. The second was to conduct a typological analysis of the projectile points to {{gain an understanding of}} the chronology of the site. The third was to couple the chronological information with an examination of the horizontal and vertical distributions of the cultural materials to determine whether components can be isolated. The fourth was to identify those parts of the collection that have the potential to yield important information and hence warrant curation.

40|$|The dawn of {{the eighteenth}} century in the Apalachicola delta region of the Florida panhandle was a time of major social {{upheaval}} that has been underexplored by current research. There are no historic records that describe the events and peoples in the region during establishment of the Spanish missions in the Tallahassee area to the east. Archaeological evidence shows the disappearance of the late prehistoric Mississippian Fort Walton people and the brief emergence of the protohistoric Lamar archaeological culture {{during the time of the}} destruction of the Spanish mission system around 1704. The Lighthouse Bayou site, 8 Gu 114, in Gulf County, has both a Fort Walton and a Lamar component, and therefore offers an opportunity to understand this tumultuous time period better. Comparison of the ceramics shows a transition from incised rectilinear scrolling motifs during Fort Walton to a series of incised and stamped designs, along with the emergence of check-stamping as common surface decorations during Lamar. Temper choices are further indicative: pottery of both components has extensive sand and grit tempering, with only limited shell- or grog-tempered vessels, suggesting that indigenous peoples here did not identify with the missionized Apalachee Indians. The lithic data, while limited, show that both the Fort Walton and Lamar inhabitants were more likely retouching existing tools rather than creating new ones; however, the proportion of <b>flake</b> <b>types</b> suggest that the Lamar inhabitants may have exploited chert to a greater extent than did their Fort Walton counterparts. The faunal data show considerable difference in food source exploitation strategies. The Fort Walton inhabitants used the Lighthouse Bayou site specifically to procure shellfish and fish, while the Lamar inhabitants made use of a wider variety of protein sources throughout the area. These differences suggest a contrast between the two time periods: Fort Walton existed under the relatively stable aegis of the late prehistoric Mississippian era. The Lamar people, while not Apalachee Indians, must have been another group fleeing the conflict amid the destruction of the Spanish missions and the general social collapse in Florida’s early eighteenth century...|$|R
40|$|In {{rolling contact}} fatigue, cracks grow by tensile (Mode I) or shear modes (Mode II and III) under the {{material}} surface {{due to the}} complicated tri-axial stress state. <b>Flaking</b> <b>type</b> failure, such as bearings and rails, is essentially due to the crack growth behaviour of these cracks. In order to evaluate the fatigue strength under rolling contact loading, {{it is important to}} understand the characteristics of such cracks under complicated stress state. The aim of this thesis was to study mixed mode behaviour of fatigue cracks, under cyclic shear stress and static compressive stress. Both experimental and numerical methods are applied. Experimental work consisted of the fatigue testing of bearing steel (SAE 52100) under compressive mean stress. The test results show that resistance to mode I crack propagation increases with increasing compressive mean stress. In addition, non-propagating cracks, which are hardly observed at stress ratio R of - 1 in high strength steel, were observed at R = - 5 and - 10. In the numerical investigations, stress intensity factor of complicated branch cracks in a plate (2 D) under combined cyclic shear stress and static compressive stress was determined by finite element method. This study reveal the interaction behavior between the mode I and II cracks. The experimental and simulation results showed that there is a competitive behaviour between the Mode I and Mode II crack growth. The role of the compressive mean stress is to suppress the Mode I crack propagation. The magnitude of the compressive mean stress required to suppress Mode I crack growth depends on the Mode II crack length and applied cyclic shear stress. It was also observed that mode I crack lengths, if long enough, may reduce the KII of the Mode II crack even by 63 %. The observation of non-propagating cracks for high compressive mean stress is one of novel finding of this study. However, the physical reason for this is not yet know. This is left future work. Furthermore, the numerical investigations can be extended to study more detail the influence of crack surface friction on crack growth mechanics...|$|R
