40|$|Background: Since 2007, the {{postgraduate}} training of family physicians for South African district hospitals has been formalised. This training differs from European and North American programmes as up to 30 % {{of the skills}} needed rely on district hospital surgical, obstetrics and anaesthetics procedures, particularly in rural areas, as outlined in the <b>national</b> <b>unit</b> standards. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the appropriateness and sufficiency of learning opportunities for these skills in a rural district hospital. Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was undertaken of the number and type of procedures performed in theatre for a 1 -year period and compared with the required procedural skills stipulated in the <b>national</b> <b>unit</b> standards. Descriptive statistical analyses were used to analyse categorical data. Results: Three thousand seven hundred and forty-one procedures were performed during the study period. Anaesthesia was the most common procedure, followed by Caesarean section. There were adequate opportunities for teaching most core skills. Conclusions: Sufficient and appropriate learning opportunities exist for postgraduate family medicine training in all the core skills performed in a theatre according to the <b>national</b> <b>unit</b> standards.
