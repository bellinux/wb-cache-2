40|$|Abstract—When {{studying}} membrane-bound protein receptors, it {{is necessary}} to move beyond the current state-of-theart simulations that only consider small membrane patches and implicit solvent. Limits of traditional computer platforms negatively impact the model’s level of realism and the computational scales achievable. On the other hand, multi-core platforms such as GPUs offer the possibility to span length scales in membrane simulations much larger and with higher resolutions than before. To this end, this paper presents the design and implementation of an advanced GPU algorithm for Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of large membrane regions in the NVT, NVE, and NPT ensembles using explicit solvent and Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method for treating the conditionallyconvergent electrostatic component of the classical force field. A key component of our algorithm is the redesign of the traditional PME method to better fit on the multithreading GPU architecture. This has been considered a fundamentally hard problem in the molecular dynamics community working on massively multithreaded architecture. Our algorithm is integrated in the code FENZI (yun dong <b>de</b> <b>FEN</b> ZI in Mandarin or moving molecules in English). The paper analyzes both the performance and accuracy of large-scale GPU-enabled simulations of membranes using FENZI, showing how our code can enable multi-nanosecond MD simulations per day, even when using PME...|$|E

40|$|Os efeitos farmacológicos dos extratos etanólicos de Pradosia huberi (EPH) e Attalea excelsa (EAE) sobre o sistema cardiovascular, foram estudados em ratos usando técnicas in vivo e in vitro. EPH (5, 10 e 20 mg. Kg- 1 i. v.) promoveu hipotensão (- 5, 6 ± 0, 5; - 8, 8 ± 1, 3 e - 32, 6 ± 6, 6 %, respectivamente) dose-dependente em ratos não anestesiados, acompanhada por bradicardia (- 0, 3 &# 61617; 0, 9; - 4, 4 &# 61617; 2, 2 e - 45, 3 &# 61617; 6, 0 %, respectivamente) (n= 6). Após tratamento agudo com um antagonista muscarínico (Atropina, 2 mg. Kg- 1), a hipotensão (- 5, 0 ± 0, 8; - 6, 4 ± 0, 9; - 11, 6 ± 1, 8 %, respectivamente) e bradicardia (- 1, 2 ± 0, 4; - 2, 9 ± 0, 8 e - 8, 1 ± 2, 2 %) foram significantemente atenuados. O hexametônio, um bloqueador ganglionar, também atenuou tais efeitos de EPH. Entretanto após L-NAME ambas as respostas não foram modificadas. Em anéis de artéria mesentérica {{superior}} isolada de rato, com endotélio intacto, EPH (1; 3; 10; 30 e 100 &# 61549;g/mL) promoveu relaxamento das contrações induzidas por FEN (10 &# 61549;M) (CE 50 = 17, 14 ± 2, 9; Emax= 87, 8 ± 2, 9, n= 8) de maneira dependente de concentração. Tal efeito foi abolido com a remoção do endotélio funcional, sugerindo o envolvimento de um mecanismo dependente do endotélio. Frações e a 2, 3 -diidromiricetina 3 -&# 61537;-L-raminosídeo, isolada de EPH, não relaxaram ou relaxaram com menos potencia e eficácia as preparação pré-contraídas com FEN. A curva concentração-resposta para EPH foi significantemente atenuada com redução do efeito máximo (Emax), na presença de L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M), ODQ (1 &# 61549;M), KCl 20 mM, indometacina(1 &# 61549;M) + L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M), 4 -AP (1 mM), BaCl 2 (30 &# 956;M), TEA (1 mM). Na presença de L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M) + L-arginina (1 mM) EPH relaxou as preparações sem alterar o Emax. Em anéis pré-contraídos com KCl 80 mM EPH não induziu relaxamento. Já na presença de atropina (1 &# 61544;M), indometacina (1 &# 61549;M), glibenclamida (10 &# 61549;M) e apamina (1 &# 956;M) a curva para EPH não foi alterada. Em suma, concluímos que o efeito hipotensor de EPH envolve tanto sua ação vasorelaxante como também uma possível ativação indireta de receptores muscarínicos cardíacos e ainda que o efeito vascular de EPH pode envolver a ativação da via eNOS-NO-GMPc, além da participação dos canais para potássio do tipo BKCa, Kv e Kir na musculatura lisa vascular. EAE (5; 10; 20; 40 e 60 mg/kg i. v.) induziu hipotensão (- 3, 7 ± 1, 2; - 6, 1 ± 2, 3; - 8, 5 ± 1, 3; - 9, 9 ± 1, 6 e - 11, 2 ± 1, 8 %, respectivamente) e taquicardia (3, 8 ± 1, 7; 4, 0 ± 1, 6; 3, 8 ± 2, 0; 3, 7 ± 3, 1 e 12, 4 ± 2, 7 %, respectivamente) (n= 5), provavelmente de origem reflexa. Em anéis de artéria mesentérica superior isolada de rato, EAE (1; 3; 10; 30; 100; 300; 500 e 1000 &# 61549;g/mL) induziu relaxamento dependente da concentração tanto em anéis intactos (CE 50 = 172, 3 ± 36, 9, Emáx = 100 ± 0, 0 %) como desnudos de endotélio (CE 50 = 166, 7 ± 31, 4, Emáx = 92, 2 ± 7, 1 %), pré-contraídos com 10 &# 61549;M <b>de</b> <b>FEN,</b> com mesma potencia e eficácia (n= 6). Sugerindo EAE age por mecanismo independente do endotélio. Os experimentos subseqüentes procederam-se em preparações sem endotélio. Diante da incubação com KCl 20 mM, o efeito vasorelaxante de EAE não foi alterado (CE 50 = 108, 1 ± 10, 7 e Emáx = 95, 9 ± 4, 4 %). EAE relaxou com mesma potencia anéis sem endotélio pré-contraídos pelo KCl 80 Mm (Emax= 97, 1 ± 1, 5 %) e pela FEN (Emáx = 92, 2 ± 7, 1 %). Sugerindo que EAE atua sobre os canais para Ca 2 + dependentes de voltagem. Adicionalmente, EAE antagonizou de maneira dependente de concentração as contrações induzidas por CaCl 2 em meio despolarizante nominalmente sem Ca 2 +. EAE (1; 3; 10; 30; 100; 300; 500 e 1000 &# 61549;g/mL) relaxou contrações induzidas pelo S(-) -Bay K 8644 (Emáx = 128, 8 ± 5, 8 %, n= 8), um agonista de canais para Ca 2 + tipo-L. EAE não alterou as contrações transientes induzidas por cafeína (20 mM) e pouco influenciou aquelas induzidas pela FEN (10 &# 956;M). Em átrio isolado de rato, EAE ocasionou cronotropismo e inotropismo negativo. Estudos eletrofisiológicos em células A 7 r 5 (100 &# 956;M) EAE inibiu correntes de Ba 2 + através dos CaVL 1. 2. Em conclusão, sugere-se que o efeito hipotensor de EAE é resultado de sua ação vasorelaxante que parece decorrente da sua ação sobre o influxo de cálcio através dos CaV 1. 2 nos miocitos vasculares. The pharmacological {{effects of}} Pradosia huberi (EHP) and Attalea excelsa (EAE) ethanolics extracts on the cardiovascular system were studied in rats using a combined in vivo and in vitro approach. In non-anaesthetized rats, EPH (5, 10 or 20 mg. Kg- 1 i. v.) injections produced hypotension (- 5. 6 ± 0. 5; - 8. 8 ± 1. 3 and - 32. 6 ± 6. 6 %, respectively) and bradicardia (- 0. 3 &# 61617; 0. 9; - 4. 4 &# 61617; 2. 2 and - 45. 3 &# 61617; 6. 0 %, respectively) (n= 6). After acute treatment with a muscarinic agonist (atropine, 2 mg. Kg- 1, hypotension (- 5. 0 ± 0. 8, - 6. 4 ± 0. 9 and - 11. 6 ± 1. 8 %, respectively) and bradicardia (- 1. 2 ± 0. 4, - 2. 9 ± 0. 8 and - 8. 1 ± 2. 2 %) were significantly attenuated. Hexamethonium, a ganglionic blocker, also attenuated {{the effect of}} EPH. After L-NAME both answers were not modified. In isolated rat mesenteric artery rings, with intact endothelium, EPH (1, 3, 10, 30 and 100 &# 61549;g/mL) induced concentration-dependent relaxation of the contractions induced by Phe (10 &# 61549;M) (EC 50 = 17. 14 ± 2. 9; Emax= 87. 8 ± 2. 9, n= 8) and this effect was abolished by removal of vascular endothelium, suggesting the involvement of a mechanism endothelium-dependent. Fractions and 2 - 3 dihydromyricetin- 3 -O-&# 61537;-L-rhamnoside isolated from EPH did not relax or relaxed with less potency and effectiveness the preparation pre-contracted with Phe. The concentration-response curve for EPH was significantly shifted to the right with L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M), ODQ (1 &# 61549;M), KCl 20 mM, indomethacin (1 &# 61549;M) + L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M), 4 -AP (1 mM), BaCl 2 (30 &# 956;M), TEA (1 mM). In the presence of L-NAME (100 &# 61549;M) + L-arginine (1 mM) EHP relaxed preparations without changing the Emax. EPH did not induce relaxation on KCl 80 mM precontracted rings. Once {{in the presence of}} atropine (1 &# 61544;M), indomethacin (1 &# 61549;M), glibenclamide (10 &# 61549;M) and apamin (1 &# 956;M) the curve of EPH was not altered. We concluded that the hypotensive effect of EPH seems result of its vasorelaxant action and can involve an indirect activation of muscarinic heart receptors and still that the vascular effect of EPH can involve the activation of the eNOS-NO-GMPc ways well as the participation of BKCa, KV, and Kir potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle. EAE (5, 10, 20, 40 and 60 mg/kg i. v.) induced hypotension (- 3. 7 ± 1. 2; - 6. 1 ± 2. 3; - 8. 5 ± 1. 3; - 9. 9 ± 1. 6 and - 11. 2 ± 1. 8 %, respectively) and tachycardia (3. 8 ± 1. 7; 4. 0 ± 1. 6; 3. 8 ± 2. 0; 3. 7 ± 3. 1 and 12. 4 ± 2. 7 %, respectively) (n= 5) probably due to a reflex response. In isolated rat mesenteric artery rings, EAE (1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 &# 61549;g/mL) induced relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner in both intact-(EC 50 = 172. 3 ± 36. 9, Emax = 100 ± 0. 0 %) or removed-endothelium rings (EC 50 = 166, 7 ± 31, 4, Emáx = 92, 2 ± 7, 1 %) pre-contracted with Phe 10 &# 61549;M with the same potency and effectiveness (n= 6). These results suggest that EAE acts by an endothelium-independent mechanism. Subsequent experiments were accomplished in preparations without endothelium. In preparation pre-incubated with KCl 20 mM, the vasorelaxant activity of EAE was not changed (EC 50 = 108. 1 ± 10. 7 and Emáx = 95. 9 ± 4. 4 %). EAE relaxed with the same potency rings precontracted with KCl 80 mM (Emax = 97. 1 ± 1. 5 %) or with Phe (Emax = 92. 2 ± 7. 1 %) suggesting that EAE acts on the voltage-dependent Ca 2 +-channels. Furthermore, in depolarizing medium nominally without Ca 2 +, EAE antagonized CaCl 2 -induced contractions in a concentrationdependent manner. EAE (1, 3, 10, 30, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 &# 61549;g/mL) induced relaxation concentration-dependent, contractions elicited by the L-type Ca 2 + channel agonist, S(-) -Bay K 8644 (Emáx = 128. 8 ± 5. 8 %, n= 8). EAE did not alter transient contractions induced by caffeine (20 mM) and little influenced those induced by Phe (10 &# 61549;M). In rat isolated atrium, EAE produced negative inotropic and cronotropic effect. Electrophysiological studies on cells A 7 r 5 (100 &# 61549;M) EAE inhibited Ba 2 + current through the CaVL 1. 2. In conclusion, the results suggested that the hypotensive effect of EAE is due to its vasorelaxant action that seems to be attributed to the influx of Ca 2 + through CaV 1. 2 channels in vascular myocytes...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Mating {{events and}} aggregations of {{vulnerable}} nurse sharks Ginglymostoma cirratum {{were recorded in}} the insular protected area of Fernando <b>de</b> Noronha (<b>FEN),</b> Brazil, between April and August 2015. Female sharks were observed clustering in groups of up to 14 individuals in shallow water adjacent to the shore. Several evasive mating behaviours {{in the presence of}} males were noticed, including shoreward movement, positioning ventral side up at the sea surface with emerged pectoral and pelvic fins, body rolling and caudal fin thrashing. Fresh bite marks indicative of male courtship and coupling attempts were visible in female's pectoral and caudal fins. Altogether, the observed behaviours match previous reports of non-cooperative female nurse sharks during mating opportunities. An extended mating season coupled with a persistent use of inshore habitats result in nurse sharks being particularly vulnerable to human pressure during a most sensitive stage of their life cycle. The effective conservation of nurse shark populations from the western South Atlantic may thus depend on the protection of critical habitats where this species aggregates to reproduce. Explicitly addressing environmental requirements by vulnerable species in local management strategies is indispensable to ensure that human pressure, including ecotourism development, does not collide with stipulated conservation aims...|$|R
40|$|The Frisian author Simke Kloosterman (1876 - 1938) left us {{a varied}} oeuvre. After having showed how by upbringing, {{education}} and life style {{she was an}} exception within her gender category, I focus on her story ‘Libbensbloei’ (Life’s blossoming) (1902) from a queer perspective. The story {{is a tribute to}} a deceased girlfriend, written from an ‘I’ perspective. I make plausible that the ‘I’ must be a woman, so it can be called a story with a lesbian theme. That hidden meaning was noted by some and ignored or denied by other critics. The novel <b>De</b> Hoara’s <b>fen</b> Hastings (The Hoara’s of Hastings) (1921), about a farmers family, the Hoara’s, living in the village of Hastings, is well-known, not least because it’s the very first novel in Frisian. I analyse the novel from a gender perspective. Power appears to be not bound to one specific gender category. Hester Hoara, a strong single woman having her own farm, moves to the city and marries lateron in the story. Kloosterman, by conforming to the male, heterosexual literary norm, stood against her main female character and did not permit her the same freedom as she enjoyed herself. Male critics expected more of the female characters in the novel. Female critics did not find hidden meanings of female writing. My conclusion is that, more than a heroine of lesbian literature or of female writing, Kloosterman is a Frisian heroine. Presumably, that was all she {{wanted to be in the}} first place. ...|$|R
50|$|In any case, Justus {{as well as}} Eeltsje {{started writing}} poetry and short fiction, and as Justus {{remained}} the editor of Eeltsje's works for his entire life, their oeuvres were strongly connected and published together from the very beginning. In 1822, {{the best of their}} early works were collected under the title of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar ("Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket"; original, archaic spelling: <b>De</b> Lape Koer <b>fen</b> Gabe Skroor), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story. This publication was attributed to the fictional 'Gabe Skroar', a lame farmer's son who became a tailor and a writer, but died young. This character was in all probability a creation of Eeltsje's. Hiding behind such a fictional author was fairly normal at that time, but Breuker suggests that an extra reason may have been that the Halbertsmas felt it was a little silly to put two names on such a limited collection.|$|R

The {{results of this study}} constrained by 9 AMS radiocarbon measurements are combined with archaeological data and compared with similar research carried out at the same altitude in the adjacent Madriu valley (Andorra). The overall objectives of this article are, first, to formulate different chronological patterns and spatial land-use distribution at a micro-regional scale during prehistory and, second, to discuss different drivers of prehistoric occupation models in the eastern Pyrenean highlands. The palaeoecological study of the Planells <b>de</b> Perafita <b>fen</b> was performed at high temporal resolution, allowing us to focus on detailed prehistoric (mainly Mesolithic and Neolithic) and Bronze Age human activity. It demonstrates that the shaping of this cultural landscape {{is the result of a}} long-term land-use history, which began at the late Mesolithic/early Neolithic transition onwards (ca 6400 – 6100 cal BC). The existence of three main phases of ‘‘inter-valley'' land-use variability has also been highlighted, thus testifying a complex and heterogeneous upland land-use model during the Neolithic and Bronze Age. These land-use variabilities between the two adjacent Andorran valleys provide the basis for a discussion of the way in which environmental constraints influenced prehistoric land-use spatial organisation and of how the interaction between environmental (including climatic parameters), socio-economic and cultural conditions affected the temporal and spatial dynamics of landscape shaping in the eastern Pyrenean highlands...|$|R

A second, expanded edition of De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar, consisting of 237 pages, was published in 1829, followed by a third, further expanded edition in 1834, running to almost 500 pages of a larger size. After that, additions were published separately in 1836 (De Noarger Rún oan Gabe Skroar), 1840 (Twigen út in Alde Stamme), 1854 (Leed en Wille en de Flotgerzen), and 1858 (De Jonkerboer and Teltsjes fan de Wize Mannen fan Esonstêd).|$|R
25|$|To attain {{his first}} goal, Halbertsma {{had to use}} his {{writings}} to penetrate the daily life of the Frisian people. This he achieved by authoring folk literature with his brother Eeltsje. The state and social status of the Western Frisian language at that time becomes clear if one observes the fact that Halbertsma and his brothers, though they laboured tirelessly {{for the use of}} Frisian as a written language for poetry and prose, lapsed into Dutch for their correspondence with each other, and apparently did not feel that was in any way strange. As Halbertsma remained the editor of Eeltsje's work for his entire life, their poetry and short fiction were strongly connected and published together from the very beginning. For that reason the linguist Foeke Buitenrust Hettema would describe Halbertsma later as the 'literary agent' of his brothers Eeltsje and Tsjalling. In 1822, their early works were collected under the title De Lapekoer fan Gabe Skroar ("Gabe Tailor's Rag Basket"; original, archaic spelling: <b>De</b> Lape Koer <b>fen</b> Gabe Skroor), a booklet consisting of 36 pages, and including six poems and one short story.

The main building within the excavated portion is a farm of 17 meters by 6 meters. The outer wall consisted of poles that were connected with braid and were covered with clay. The posts within the farm will have borne the roof. A series of heavy poles {{on the south side}} of the farm probably supported a far extended roof on that side that was necessary in view of the down pouring rain that could wash away the clay there. In the long walls of the farmhouse opposite to each other there are two wide entrances forming a corridor which divided the building into a living area and a shed or barn.Around the farm there were numerous outbuildings. The most notable was a circular building that was probably a sheepfold. The other buildings are square or rectangular sheds and called [...] "Spiekers": constructions of four or six poles with a raised floor for the storage of grain and hay. Northwest of the main building was a large barn of 7 by 3.5 meters. The many other posts will have served a variety of small buildings that belong to a farm like racks, an apiary, doghouse etc. The dark spots on the map were pits which were probably used for manure or the storing of winter silage.|$|R
40|$|Increasing our {{knowledge}} about the spatial ecology of apex predators and their interactions with diverse habitats and fisheries is necessary for understanding the trophic mechanisms that underlie several aspects of marine ecosystem dynamics and for guiding informed management policies. A preliminary assessment of tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) population structure off the oceanic insular system of Fernando <b>de</b> Noronha (<b>FEN)</b> and the large-scale movements performed by this species in the equatorial Atlantic Ocean was conducted using longline and handline fishing gear and satellite telemetry. A total of 25 sharks measuring 175 - 372 cm in total length (TL) were sampled. Most sharks were likely immature females ranging between 200 and 260 cm TL, with few individuals < 200 cm TL being caught. This contrasts greatly with the tiger shark size-distribution previously reported for coastal waters off the Brazilian mainland, where most individuals measured < 200 cm TL. Also, the movements of 8 individuals measuring 202 - 310 cm TL were assessed with satellite transmitters for a combined total of 757 days (mean = 94. 6 days∙shark- 1; SD = 65. 6). These sharks exhibited a considerable variability in their horizontal movements, with three sharks showing a mostly resident behavior around FEN during {{the extent of the}} respective tracks, two sharks traveling west to the South American continent, and two sharks moving mostly along the middle of the oceanic basin, one of which ending up in the northern hemisphere. Moreover, one shark traveled east to the African continent, where it was eventually caught by fishers from Ivory Coast in less than 474 days at liberty. The present results suggest that young tiger sharks measuring < 200 cm TL make little use of insular oceanic habitats from the western South Atlantic Ocean, which agrees with a previously-hypothesized ontogenetic habitat shift from coastal to oceanic habitats experienced by juveniles of this species in this region. In addition, this study adds evidence that tiger sharks are able to connect marine trophic webs from the neritic provinces of the eastern and western margins of the Atlantic Ocean across the equatorial basin and that they may experience mortality induced by remote fisheries. All this information is extremely relevant for understanding the energetic balance of marine ecosystems as much as the exposure of this species to fishing pressure in this yet poorly-known region...|$|R
