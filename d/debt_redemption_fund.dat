As monetary policy has exhausted its conventional options, fiscal policy is called upon to provide an expansionary impulse by raising public investment. The high level of risk premiums in the crisis-hit countries continues to impair monetary policy transmission. If governments agreed on a temporary <b>debt</b> <b>redemption</b> <b>fund,</b> the ECB could engage in large-scale unconventional policy measures such government bond purchases to cancel out sovereign yield differentials in the euro area. Monetary policy could then stimulate the economy in the crisis-hit countries. The coalition agreement is pointing in the right direction regarding the labor market. The pension proposals, however, are patchwork and unable to solve the fundamental problem of an excessive lowering of the pension level and the concomittant higher risk of old-age poverty.

In doing so, we envisage a country-specific amortization scheme in which the sovereign debts exceeding the 60 % ceiling of GDP is redeemed in 30 years. The paper shows that our redemption scheme is cheaper and less constraining than that proposed by Doluca et al. (2012 a). Also, our paper shows that fiscal “brakes ” – such as those required by the Fiscal Compact – are not necessary for the complete <b>redemption</b> of the <b>Fund...</b>|$|R

40|$|Financial {{exclusion}} and <b>debt</b> <b>redemption</b> This article deals {{with issues of}} financial exclusion. It reports upon the growing scale of such exclusion in contemporary Britain, explores its causes and considers the policies currently pursued by government. The authors suggest that present policies concentrate upon supply-side solutions, looking to improve the provision of mainstream financial services to impoverished individuals and communities. These supply-side solutions rely upon exhortation and the mobilization of good-will among providing institutions, rather than the enforcement of legal obligation. The article then outlines a particular initiative designed to tackle financial exclusion from a demand-side perspective, {{that is to say}} through the improvement of the financial circumstances of indebted individuals themselves. It concludes by emphasizing the contribution which such ‘bottom-up’, rather than ‘top-down’, solutions can make to combating financial exclusion. Key words: credit unions, poverty, social exclusion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} stylized two-period, two-country model {{illustrating}} {{the role of}} distribution of domestic wealth in determining a country's level of access to international lending. We model sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>redemption</b> policy in a common agency framework. Within this framework, policy is {{the outcome of the}} interaction between government and local and foreign interest groups with conflicting preferences on debt repayment. Our main result is that in full lobby competition, when all interests are represented, the only equilibrium solution is repudiation and the consequent inability of government to access international capital markets. Conversely, when the ability to lobby depends on wealth, governments can access international credit up to a given maximum external debt capacity, determined by the skew in the distribution of domestic wealth.

It {{was not until the}} early 2000s that fund complexes introduced open-ended funds that were redeemable each day. While quarterly <b>redemption</b> <b>funds</b> and closed-end funds remained the standard because the secondary loan market does not offer the rich liquidity that is supportive of open-end funds, the open-end funds had sufficiently raised their profile that by mid-2008 they accounted for 15-20% of the loan assets held by mutual funds.|$|R

We model sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>redemption</b> policy as the outcome of the interaction between the domestic government and interest groups (locals and foreigners) with conflicting preferences about debt repayment (common agency framework). The main result produced by our model is that, although discriminatory taxation against foreign bond-holders is not available and foreigners are allowed entering the process of buying influence, default is always ex-post observed when all domestic interests are represented and a share of sovereign debt is detained by foreigners. On the contrary, by assuming selective participation to lobbying, we show that a borrowing country’s access to international capital markets increases with inequality in the domestic distribution of wealth.

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} dynamic {{allocation}} effects and intergenerational welfare consequences of environmental taxes. To this end, environmental externalities are introduced in a Blanchard-Yaari overlapping generations {{model of a}} small open economy. A rise in environmental taxes - taking into account pre-existing distortionary taxes and endogenous labor supply - is shown to yield an efficiency gain if agents care enough for the environment. The benefits are unevenly distributed across generations because agents are heterogeneous in their capital ownership, An accompanying debt policy can be designed - prescribing debt accumulation at impact and <b>debt</b> <b>redemption</b> in the new steady state - to ensure everybody gains to the same extent. With lump-sum recycling of environmental tax revenue, aggregate employment is unaffected in the short run, but falls {{in the long run}}. Furthermore, it raises environmental quality more in the long run than in the short run. Recycling revenue through a cut in labor taxes, however, is shown to yield a rise in employment in the short run, which disappears during transition. In the new steady state, environmental quality is higher at the expense of a lower level of employment. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of the study in this regard was on the impact assessment of microfinance on rural indebtedness in marine fisheries sector {{as well as to}} assess the extent of indebtedness among marine fisherfolk in mechanized, motorized and traditional sectors and the role of credit agencies in providing credit.

30|$|For {{the purpose}} of our study we extend a model {{previously}} used by Blaufus and Hundsdoerfer (2008) and Blaufus and Mantei (2014) to incorporate leverage-based as well as EBITDA-based IDR. In a baseline model we will assume full loss offset, full deductibility of interest expenses as well as full taxability of default gains and show that this will lead to organizational form neutrality if tax rates for both forms are identical. Integrating IDR in the model, we find opposing effects: first, a dividend effect which privileges the corporation {{due to the fact}} that IDR increase only the corporate income tax burden but not shareholders’ taxes. Second, a default gain effect which arises if default gains and interest expenses are treated asymmetrically. If default gains (arising due to failure in <b>debt</b> <b>redemption)</b> are taxed to a higher extent than interest is deductible, this discriminates against the corporation. We demonstrate that organizational form neutrality can only be achieved in the case of leverage-based IDR and requires a full loss offset, a symmetric treatment of interest and default gains as well as either a legal form dependent IDR or absence of shareholder taxation which is in contrast to actual legal regulations. If we consider corporate loss offset restrictions, IDR always distort the choice of organizational form.|$|R
