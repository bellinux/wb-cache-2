5|$|Up {{until the}} middle part of the 20th century, it was {{customary}} to wear Tudor style under-dress, consisting of white silk embroidered doublet, breeches, full hose, white doeskin pumps with satin bows and a sword belt with sword, under the robes. Nowadays, morning <b>dress</b> <b>or</b> a lounge suit is worn, except for coronations when Tudor under-dress is worn by the canopy-bearers.|$|E
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a <b>dress,</b> <b>or</b> a skirt and blouse, with an apron on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E

For example, one study found that 21 % of the participants had trouble with <b>dressing</b> <b>or</b> undressing, 25 % with mobility at home, and 31 % with eating and drinking. Another study showed that 27, 5 % experience difficulty with bathing and 16. 6 % with <b>dressing</b> <b>or</b> undressing.

25|$|The Quran instructs both Muslim men {{and women}} to dress in a modest way, but there is {{disagreement}} on how these instructions should be interpreted. The verses relating to dress use the terms khimār (head cover) and jilbāb (a <b>dress</b> <b>or</b> cloak) rather than ḥijāb.|$|E
25|$|Prince Albert, consort to Queen Victoria, {{is usually}} {{credited}} with popularising the frock coat. During the Victorian era, the frock coat rapidly became universally worn in Britain, Europe and America as standard formal business <b>dress,</b> <b>or</b> for formal daytime events.

25|$|The grand {{marriage}} {{is a symbol of}} social status on the Comoros islands. The completion of an ada marriage also greatly increases a man’s standing in the Comoran hierarchy. A Comoran man can only wear certain elements of the national <b>dress</b> <b>or</b> stand in the first line at the mosque if he has had a grand marriage. Also, one is not fully considered a man until he has had an ada marriage.|$|E
25|$|Each culture {{specifies}} manners such as rituals, {{styles of}} <b>dress,</b> <b>or</b> other habits, {{as well as}} attitudes, in which the bereaved are encouraged or expected to take part. An analysis of non-Western cultures suggests that beliefs about continuing ties with the deceased varies. In Japan, maintenance of ties with the deceased is accepted and carried out through religious rituals. In the Hopi of Arizona, the deceased are quickly forgotten and life continues on.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{symptoms}} {{could be due to}} polycystic ovary syndrome, a complex multi-endocrine disorder including hirsutism (male pattern/type hair growth) due to increased androgen hormone levels, and abdominal obesity due to the hormone insulin receptor defects. As she had very little comprehension for the need of most social norms and little desire to act, <b>dress,</b> <b>or</b> do other social norms, preferring to wearing, acting, and doing only that which she deemed logically practical, Buckley suggested Pervasive Developmental Disorder i.e., Asperger's Syndrome.|$|E

25|$|A {{diving suit}} is a garment or device {{designed}} to protect a diver from the underwater environment. A diving suit may also incorporate a breathing gas supply (i.e. Standard diving <b>dress</b> <b>or</b> atmospheric diving suit). {{but in most cases}} applies only to the environmental protective covering worn by the diver. The breathing gas supply is usually referred to separately. There is no generic term for the combination of suit and breathing apparatus alone. It is generally referred to as diving equipment or dive gear along with any other equipment necessary for the dive.|$|E
25|$|Enka {{suggests}} a traditional, idealized, or romanticized aspect of Japanese culture and attitudes. Enka singers, predominantly women, usually perform in a kimono or in evening dress. Male enka performers tend to wear formal <b>dress,</b> <b>or</b> in some performances, traditional Japanese attire. Nods to traditional Japanese music {{are common in}} enka. The melodies of enka are fundamentally Western harmonies, and electronic instruments are used, such as synthesizers and electric lead guitar with plenty of distortion, but its musical instruments also include traditional Japanese instruments such as the shakuhachi and the shamisen.|$|E
25|$|Changshan, {{along with}} qipao, were {{introduced}} to China during the Qing dynasty (17th–20th centuries). The Manchus in 1636 ordered that all Han Chinese should adopt the changshan style of <b>dress</b> <b>or</b> face harsh punishment. However, after the 1644 fall of the Ming dynasty, the Manchu stopped this order; they required only that court and government officials wear Manchu clothes. Commoners were still allowed to wear the hanfu. Over time, the commoners adopted the changshan and qipao as their own dress. The traditional Chinese Hanfu style of clothing was gradually replaced. Over time, the Manchu style gained popularity.|$|E

25|$|In England {{from the}} 1630s, under the {{influence}} of literature and especially court masques, Anthony van Dyck and his followers created a fashion for having one's portrait painted in exotic, historical or pastoral <b>dress,</b> <b>or</b> in simplified contemporary fashion with various scarves, cloaks, mantles, and jewels added to evoke a classic or romantic mood, and also to prevent the portrait appearing dated within a few years. These paintings are the progenitors of the fashion of the later 17th century for having one's portrait painted in undress, and do not necessarily reflect clothing as it was actually worn.|$|E
25|$|In 1366, so {{that the}} English Crown could assert its {{authority}} over the settlers, a parliament was assembled in Kilkenny and the Statute of Kilkenny was enacted. The statute decreed that intermarriage between English settlers and Irish natives was forbidden. It also forbade the settlers using the Irish language and adopting Irish modes of <b>dress</b> <b>or</b> other customs, as such practices were already common. The adoption of Gaelic Brehon property law, in particular, undermined the feudal nature of the Lordship. The Act was never implemented successfully, even in the Pale itself, and {{was a sign of}} how Ireland was withdrawing from English cultural norms.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the second half of the 1790s that fashionable women in France began to adopt a thoroughgoing Classical style, based on an {{idealized}} version of ancient Greek and Roman <b>dress</b> (<b>or</b> what was thought at the time to be ancient Greek and Roman dress), with narrow clinging skirts. Some of the extreme Parisian versions of the neoclassical style (such as narrow straps which bared the shoulders, and diaphanous dresses without sufficient stays, petticoats, or shifts worn beneath) were not widely adopted elsewhere, but many features of the late-1790s neoclassical style were broadly influential, surviving in successively modified forms in European fashions over the next two decades.|$|E

40|$|Antiseptics used in {{endodontics}} for disinfection purposes include {{root canal}} dressings and irrigants. Osmotic shock {{is known to}} cause the alteration of microbial cell viability and might {{have a role in}} the mechanism of action of root canal antiseptics. The aim of this review was to determine the role of osmolarity on the performance of antiseptics in root canal treatment. A literature search using the Medline electronic database was conducted up to 30 May 2013 using the following search terms and combinations: 'osmolarity AND root canal or endodontic or antiseptic or irrigation or irrigant <b>or</b> medication <b>or</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>or</b> biofilm; osmolality AND root canal or endodontic or antiseptic or irrigation or irrigant <b>or</b> medication <b>or</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>or</b> biofilm; osmotic AND root canal or endodontic or antiseptic or irrigation or irrigant <b>or</b> medication <b>or</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>or</b> biofilm; osmosis AND root canal or endodontic or antiseptic or irrigation or irrigant <b>or</b> medication <b>or</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>or</b> biofilm; sodium chloride AND root canal or endodontic or antiseptic or irrigation or irrigant <b>or</b> medication <b>or</b> <b>dressing</b> <b>or</b> biofilm'. Publications were included if the effects of osmolarity on the clinical performance of antiseptics in root canal treatment were stated, if preparations with different osmolarities values were compared and if they were published in English. A hand search of articles published online, 'in press' and 'early view', and in the reference list of the included papers was carried out following the same criteria. A total of 3274 publications were identified using the database, and three were included in the review. The evidence available in endodontics suggests a possible role for hyperosmotic root canal medicaments as disinfectants, and that there is no influence of osmolarity on the tissue dissolution capacity of sodium hypochlorite. There are insufficient data to obtain a sound conclusion regarding the role of hypo-osmosis in root canal disinfection, or osmosis in any further desirable ability. G. Rossi-Fedele & A. R.
