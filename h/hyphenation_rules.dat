2500|$|The English {{language}} {{does not}} have definitive <b>hyphenation</b> <b>rules,</b> though various style guides provide detailed usage recommendations, and have {{a significant amount of}} overlap in what they advise. [...] Hyphens are mostly used to break single words into parts, or to join ordinarily separate words into single words. Spaces are not placed between a hyphen and either of the elements it connects except when using a suspended or [...] "hanging" [...] hyphen that stands in for a repeated word (e.g., nineteenth- and [...] writers). [...] Style conventions that apply to hyphens (and dashes) have evolved to support ease of reading in complex constructions; editors often accept deviations if they aid rather than hinder easy comprehension.|$|E
5000|$|Bloom {{proposed}} the technique for applications where {{the amount of}} source data would require an impractically large amount of memory if [...] "conventional" [...] error-free hashing techniques were applied. He gave {{the example of a}} hyphenation algorithm for a dictionary of 500,000 words, out of which 90% follow simple <b>hyphenation</b> <b>rules,</b> but the remaining 10% require expensive disk accesses to retrieve specific hyphenation patterns. With sufficient core memory, an error-free hash could be used to eliminate all unnecessary disk accesses; on the other hand, with limited core memory, Bloom's technique uses a smaller hash area but still eliminates most unnecessary accesses. For example, a hash area only 15% of the size needed by an ideal error-free hash still eliminates 85% of the disk accesses - an 85-15 form of the Pareto principle.|$|E
40|$|As {{with other}} non-American English languages, {{typesetting}} Catalan texts imposes some special requirements on TEX. These include {{a particular set}} of hyphenation patterns and support for a special ligature: unlike other Romanic languages, Catalan incorporates the middle point in the 11 digraph. <b>Hyphenation</b> <b>rules</b> for Catalan are reviewed in ths paper, after a short introduction to hyphenation by TEX. A minimal set of hyphenation patterns covering all Catalan accents and diacritics is also presented. A discussion about the 1 ' 1 ligature concludes the paper. This work represents a first step towards the Catala...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—There are {{numerous}} formats for writing spellcheckers for open-source systems {{and there are}} many descriptions for languages written in these formats. Similarly, for word hyphenation by computer there are TEX rules for many languages. In this paper we demonstrate a method for converting these spell-checking lexicons and <b>hyphenation</b> <b>rule</b> sets into finite-state automata, and present a new finite-state based system for writer’s tools used in current open-source software such as Firefox, OpenOffice. org and enchant via the spell-checking library voikko.

50|$|In 1985, desktop {{publishing}} became available, {{starting with the}} Apple Macintosh, Aldus PageMaker (and later QuarkXPress) and PostScript. Improvements in software and hardware, and rapidly lowering costs, popularized {{desktop publishing}} and enabled very fine control of typeset results much less expensively than the minicomputer dedicated systems. At the same time, word processing systems, such as Wang and WordPerfect, revolutionized office documents. They did not, however, have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complicated book layout, graphics, mathematics, or advanced <b>hyphenation</b> and justification <b>rules</b> (H and J).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{formally}} examine hyphenation as it pertains to Modern Greek with the aim of achieving accurate and thorough machine hyphenation. Grammar rules are interpreted and formally expressed in terms of regular expressions of word substrings, and exact <b>hyphenation</b> <b>rules</b> are derived. Vowel splitting, which traditionally is indicated in terms of prohibitive rather than explicit grammar rules, is examined in detail. Many ambiguities caused by circular definitions of the prohibitive rule vowel sequences are detected, an overwhelming majority of which are resolved within the present framework. 1...|$|E
40|$|Intuitions about {{syllable}} structure {{have direct}} {{implications for the}} practical problem of hyphenation. Bruce Derwing's work on the syllable, spelling rules, and the influence of orthography in English phonological judgments is extended here to an unwritten language without accepted conventions of hyphenation. Predictions based on different principles of syllable division and standard German <b>hyphenation</b> <b>rules</b> vary for words with certain syllable forms. The judgments of syllable breaks in bisyllabic Swiss German words made by both naïve Swiss children and Swiss translation college students are well predicted by the obligatory onset principle described in the new German rules. These rules, with a minor adjustment for intervocalic stop-liquid clusters allowed word-initially, are recommended for Swiss German hyphenation. Syllable Breaks in Swiss German: Implications for Hyphenation Few dispute the psychological reality of the syllable, or its usefulness as a linguistic construct to describe phonological processes (see Kahn, 1976, for a good review), but many have discussed the difficulty in determining its boundaries in multisyllabic words...|$|E
