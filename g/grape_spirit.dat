25|$|The styles, colour, {{sweetness}} {{and quality of}} Vin Santo can vary widely depending on the grape varieties and production methods {{used to make the}} wine. While white grapes, such as Trebbiano and Malvasia in Tuscany, are most widely used, red grape varieties (such as Sangiovese) can be used to produce a rosé style wine. When red grape varieties are used, the wine is often labelled as Occhio di Pernice, which has its own DOC classification in several regions of Italy. The wines can be made to fit any style of sweetness levels from bone dry, almost Fino Sherry-like, to extremely sweet and on par with the botrytised wines of France and Germany.

2500|$|Of all {{the wines}} most closely {{associated}} with Portugal, and most reflective of the immense influence that the British have had on the Portuguese wine industry, it is Port. So close is the relationship that wine writer Karen MacNeil notes [...] "If Portugal {{is the mother of}} Port, Britain is certainly its father". While there are many theories as to the origin of the fortified wine known as Port, one of the most prevalent is that of the 1678 visit by English wine merchants to a monastery in the Portuguese town of Lamego located along the Douro river. In search of new wines to ship back to England, the merchants came across an abbot in Lamego who was producing a style of wine that the merchants had never encountered before. While fortification of wine had been known for centuries, the fortifying <b>grape</b> <b>spirit</b> was usually added after fermentation, when the wine was already fermented dry. The abbot of Lamego was fortifying his wine during fermentation, which had the effect of killing off the active yeast cells and leaving the wine with high levels of residual sugar. This method produced a very strong, alcoholic wine with noticeable levels of sweetness that was very successful in the English wine market.|$|E

50|$|Port wine is {{typically}} richer, sweeter, heavier, and higher in alcohol content than unfortified wines.

25|$|Usually {{during this}} maceration, the {{fermentation}} process starts with ambient yeasts in the cellar.

40|$|Abstract. There were {{investigated}} <b>grape</b> marc <b>spirits</b> regarding their safety on consumers. Major volatile compounds which present risk {{to human health}} (such as methanol, furfural, and acetaldehyde) and ethyl alcohol content were compared to European Union Regulation and other values found in previous studies. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety of <b>grape</b> marc <b>spirits</b> considering their content in major volatile compounds by comparison {{with the requirements of}} European Union Regulation. We investigated the ethyl alcohol content by electronic densimetry and 10 major volatile compounds (acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, methanol, 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol, 2 -butanol, isobutyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, amyl active alcohol and furfural) by Gas Chromatography coupled with Flame Ionization Detector. We used reference chemicals to identify these compounds and 3 -pentanol as internal standard to quantify the volatiles. Results were compared with the requirements of European Union Regulation. All major volatile compounds registered values in accordance to EU Regulation and the <b>grape</b> pomace <b>spirits</b> samples do not present any kind of risk for consumption...|$|R

The wine is fortified with a distilled <b>grape</b> <b>spirit</b> to bring the wine up to an alcohol level of 18-20% and the vinho abafado is added back in to add sweetness to the wine. Carcavelos wines are then aged in oak barrels for {{three to five years}} to give the wines a tawny color and nutty flavor.|$|E

In 1872, Roussillo politician François Aragon convinced the French government to legally recognize the style of vin doux naturels as wines which had residual sugar and sweetness retained from having their fermentation stopped with <b>grape</b> <b>spirits.</b> In 1936, the Institut national de l'origine et de la qualité (INAO) established Maury as an officially recognized AOC.|$|R

50|$|After {{fermentation}} is complete, {{the base}} wines are fortified with <b>grape</b> <b>spirit</b> {{in order to}} increase their final alcohol content. Wines classified as suitable for aging as Fino and Manzanilla are fortified until they reach a total alcohol content of 15.5 per cent by volume. As they age in barrel, they develop a layer of flor—a yeast-like growth that helps protect the wine from excessive oxidation. Those wines that are classified to undergo aging as Oloroso are fortified to reach an alcohol content of at least 17 per cent. They do not develop flor and so oxidise slightly as they age, giving them a darker colour. Because the fortification takes place after fermentation, most sherries are initially dry, with any sweetness being added later. In contrast, port wine is fortified halfway through its fermentation, which stops the process so that not all of the sugar is turned into alcohol.|$|E
50|$|Several wine grapes, {{including}} Clairette blanche, Piquepoul, Bianchetta Trevigiana, Catarratto and Trebbiano, {{are generally}} {{used as the}} base ingredients for vermouths. From these grapes, a low-alcohol white wine is produced by vermouth manufacturers. The wine may be aged {{for a short while}} before the addition of other ingredients. For sweet vermouths, sugar syrup is added before the wine is fortified with extra alcohol. The added alcohol is usually a neutral <b>grape</b> <b>spirit,</b> but may also come from vegetable sources such as sugar beets. The wine is then placed in large barrels or tanks to which the dry ingredients have already been added. The mixture is stirred at intervals until the dry ingredients have been absorbed and the drink is ready for bottling. Caramel color is added to make red vermouths. Most vermouths are bottled at between 16% and 18% ABV, as compared with the 9-14% ABV of most unfortified wines.|$|E

An English {{translation of the}} name would be [...] "wines naturally sweet" [...] and refers to the natural residual sugars of the grapes that are left unfermented in the wine. However these sugars are left because of the outside addition of <b>grape</b> <b>spirits</b> (or brandy) added early in the fermentation period that kills the yeast and halts the fermentation process. This process, called mutage leaves a partially fermented must (called the vin muté) with 6 to 12% alcohol from the fermentation and 5-10% alcohol by volume from the brandy. The amount of residual sugar left in the wine will vary from 50 to 125 g/l (5 to 12.5% RS).|$|R

Today, Madeira is noted for its unique winemaking process which involves heating the wine. The wine is placed in stainless steel vats that are heated via a serpentine method. Hot water, at a temperature between 45 and 50 degrees Celsius , runs through this serpentine system for a period of never less than three months. Once this heating process ("estufagem") is completed, the wine is subjected to a [...] rest period ("estágio") of at least 90 days in order to acquire the conditions that will make it possible for the oenologist to finish the wine so that it may be placed in a bottle with the required quality guarantee. These wines may never be bottled and commercialised before the 31st of October of the second year following the harvesting and are typically batch wines. Because of this unique process, Madeira is a very robust wine that can be quite long lived even after being opened.|$|R
