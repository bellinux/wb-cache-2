5|$|Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African American {{woman whose}} cancer cells {{are the source}} of the <b>HeLa</b> <b>cell</b> line, the first immortalized cell line {{and one of the most}} {{important}} cell lines in medical research. An immortalized cell line will reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the <b>HeLa</b> <b>cell</b> line continues to be a source of invaluable medical data to the present day. As was then the practice, no consent was obtained to culture her cells, nor were she or her family compensated for their extraction or use.|$|E

5|$|The <b>HeLa</b> <b>cell</b> line's {{connection}} to Henrietta Lacks was first brought to popular attention in March 1976 {{with a pair}} of articles in the Detroit Free Press and Rolling Stone written by reporter Michael Rogers. In 1998, Adam Curtis directed a BBC documentary about Henrietta Lacks called The Way of All Flesh.|$|E
40|$|Incubating {{confluent}} <b>cell</b> culture <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> for 18 h {{with increasing}} concentrations of estrogens progressively enhanced the subsequent attachment {{of a variety}} of radiolabeled bacteria to the <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells.</b> This effect was not caused by other hormones and was not produced by 1 -h incubations of <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> or bacteria with hormones. Estrogens did not similarly affect two other receptor cell lines studied. The addition of metabolic inhibitors showed that this effect of estrogens on <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> was energy dependent and involved protein synthesis. Concurrent incubation of the <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> and estrogens with the antiestrogen nafoxidine blocked the subsequent increase in adherence. These data suggest that estrogen receptors are present in <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> and that hormonally-induced alterations in the synthesis of bacterial receptor sites may modify the capacity of certain cells to bind bacteria...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this report, we cloned a novel calmodulin-kinase (CaM-KIδ) from <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> and {{characterized}} its activation mechanism. CaM-KIδ exhibits Ca 2 +/CaM-dependent {{activity that}} is enhanced (∼ 30 -fold) in vitro by phosphorylation of its Thr 180 by CaM-K kinase (CaM-KK) α, consistent with detection of CaM-KIδ-activating activity in <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells.</b> We also identified a novel CaM-KKβ isoform (CaM-KKβ- 3) in <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> whose activity was highly Ca 2 +/CaM-independent. Transiently expressed CaM-KIδ exhibited enhanced protein kinase activity in <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> without ionomycin stimulation. This sustained activation of CaM-KIδ was completely abolished by Thr 180 Ala mutation and inhibited by CaM-KK inhibitor, STO- 609, indicating a functional CaM-KK/CaM-KIδ cascade in <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
25|$|Even within {{humans and}} other mortal species, there are cells with the {{potential}} for immortality: cancer cells which have lost the ability to die when maintained in a cell culture such as the <b>HeLa</b> <b>cell</b> line, and specific stem cells such as germ cells (producing ova and spermatozoa). In artificial cloning, adult cells can be rejuvenated to embryonic status and then used to grow a new tissue or animal without ageing. Normal human cells however die after about 50 cell divisions in laboratory culture (the Hayflick Limit, discovered by Leonard Hayflick in 1961).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his basic genetic research and scientific leadership, Collins {{is known for his}} close attention to ethical and legal issues in genetics. He has been a strong advocate for protecting the privacy of genetic information and has served as a national leader in securing the passage of the federal Genetic Information and Nondiscrimination Act, which prohibits gene-based discrimination in employment and health insurance. In 2013, spurred by concerns over the publication of the genome of the widely used <b>HeLa</b> <b>cell</b> line derived from the late Henrietta Lacks, Collins and other NIH leaders worked with the Lacks family to reach an agreement to protect their privacy, while giving researchers controlled access to the genomic data.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cytotoxic {{activity}} of Artesunate(ART) {{was determined by}} MTT assay at various concentrations ranging from 0 to 100 μmol/L on <b>Hela</b> <b>cells.</b> The apoptosis effect of <b>Hela</b> <b>cells</b> treated with ART was observed by a phase contrast microscope. The Apoptosis and its mechanism induced by ART were also studied by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot. The results showed that ART has significant proliferation inhibition effect to <b>Hela</b> <b>cells</b> and the IC 50 value is 35. 4 μmol/L for 24 h.

500|$|Henrietta grew up {{in rural}} Virginia. [...] After giving birth to two of their children, she married her cousin David [...] "Day" [...] Lacks. In 1941 the young family moved to Turner Station in Baltimore County, Maryland so Day could work in Bethlehem Steel at Sparrows Point. After Henrietta {{had given birth to}} their fifth child she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer. Tissue samples from her tumors were taken without consent during treatment and these samples were then subsequently cultured into the <b>HeLa</b> <b>cell</b> line.|$|E
500|$|In March 2013, {{researchers}} {{published the}} DNA {{sequence of the}} genome of a strain of HeLa cells. The Lacks family discovered this when the author Rebecca Skloot informed them. There were objections from the Lacks family about the genetic information that was available for public access. [...] Jeri Lacks Whye, a grandchild of Henrietta Lacks, said to The New York Times, [...] "the biggest concern was privacy - what information was {{actually going to be}} out there about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing that will tell them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line". [...] That same year another group working on a different <b>HeLa</b> <b>cell</b> line's genome under NIH funding submitted it for publication. In August 2013, an agreement was announced between the family and the National Institutes of Health that gave the family some control over access to the cells' DNA sequence found in the two studies along with a promise of acknowledgement in scientific papers. In addition, two family members will join the six-member committee which will regulate access to the sequence data.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Previously, {{we found}} that altered sialidases in <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> in a natural killer-HeLa (NK-HeLa) coculture system contributed to the {{decreased}} cytotoxic ability of NK cells. However, changes {{that occur in the}} glycosylation of the <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> in the NK-HeLa coculture system remain unknown. Materials and Methods: An NK-HeLa coculture system was used to examine the changes that occur in the gangliosides of <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells.</b> Results: GD 3 expression in <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> was significantly increased in the NK-HeLa coculture system. Exogenous ganglioside GD 3 decreased the cytotoxic ability of the NK cells, which could be restored by the addition of the anti-GD 3 antibody. Coadministration of GD 3 and sialidase further decreased the cytotoxic ability of the NK cells, which could be partially restored by the addition of a sialidase inhibitor (DANA). GD 3 expression in <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> also decreased following DANA treatment. Conclusions: This study suggests that interactions between ganglioside GD 3 and sialidases in <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> influence the cytotoxic ability of NK cells...|$|R

The <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> (density 104 /μl) were brought to the p-FET surface and cultured overnight in the incubator for stabilization as shown in Figure 2 b. Thereafter, the <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, and then, the blocking with 4 % bovine serum albumin was carried out for 1 h to protect nonspecific antibody bindings in the next step. Then, the overnight incubation with a primary antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) was performed for the specific binding to Aβ peptides on the <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>HeLa</b> <b>cells,</b> {{like other}} cell lines, are termed [...] "immortal" [...] {{in that they}} can divide an {{unlimited}} number of times in a laboratory cell culture plate as long as fundamental cell survival conditions are met (i.e., being maintained and sustained in a suitable environment). There are many strains of <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> {{as they continue to}} mutate in cell cultures, but all <b>HeLa</b> <b>cells</b> are descended from the same tumor cells removed from Lacks.

2500|$|Apoptosis {{caused by}} CDV is {{typically}} induced via the extrinsic pathway, which activates caspases that disrupt cellular function and eventually {{leads to the}} cells death. In normal cells, CDV activates caspase-8 first, which works as the initiator protein followed by the executioner protein caspase-3. [...] However, apoptosis induced by CDV in HeLa cells does not involve the initiator protein caspase-8. <b>HeLa</b> <b>cell</b> apoptosis caused by CDV follows a different mechanism than that in vero cell lines. [...] This change in the caspase cascade suggests CDV induces apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway, excluding {{the need for the}} initiator caspase-8. The executioner protein is instead activated by the internal stimuli caused by viral infection not a caspase cascade.|$|E
2500|$|Active {{transcription}} {{units are}} clustered in the nucleus, in discrete sites called transcription factories or euchromatin. Such sites can be visualized by allowing engaged polymerases {{to extend their}} transcripts in tagged precursors (Br-UTP or Br-U) and immuno-labeling the tagged nascent RNA. Transcription factories can also be localized using {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} or marked by antibodies directed against polymerases. There are ~10,000 factories in the nucleoplasm of a <b>HeLa</b> <b>cell,</b> among which are ~8,000 polymerase II factories and ~2,000 polymerase III factories. Each polymerase II factory contains ~8 polymerases. As most active transcription units are associated with only one polymerase, each factory usually contains ~8 different transcription units. These units might be associated through promoters and/or enhancers, with loops forming a [...] "cloud" [...] around the factor.|$|E
2500|$|Active RNA Pol II {{transcription}} holoenzymes can be {{clustered in}} the nucleus, in discrete sites called transcription factories. There are ~8,000 such {{factories in the}} nucleoplasm of a <b>HeLa</b> <b>cell,</b> but only 100-300 RNAP II foci per nucleus in erythroid cells, {{as in many other}} tissue types. The number of transcription factories in tissues is far more restricted than indicated by previous estimates from cultured cells. [...] As an active transcription unit is usually associated with only one Pol II holoenzyme, a polymerase II factory may contain on average ~8 holoenzymes. Colocalization of transcribed genes has not been observed when using cultured fibroblast-like cells. Differentiated or committed tissue types have a limited number of available transcription sites. Estimates show that erythroid cells express at least 4,000 genes, so many genes are obliged to seek out and share the same factory.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background NDRG 2, {{a member}} of N-Myc {{downstream}} regulated gene family, plays some roles in cellular stress, cell differentiation and tumor suppression. We have found that NDRG 2 expression in cervical cancer <b>Hela</b> <b>cells</b> increases significantly upon stimulation with cisplatin, the most popular chemotherapeutic agent currently used {{for the treatment of}} advanced cervical cancer. This interesting phenomenon drove us to evaluate the role of NDRG 2 in chemosensitivity of <b>Hela</b> <b>cells.</b> Methods In the present study, RNA interference was employed to down-regulate NDRG 2 expression in <b>Hela</b> <b>cells.</b> RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect expression of NDRG 2, Bcl- 2 and Bax in cancer cells. Real-time PCR was applied to detect miR- 15 b and miR- 16 expression levels. Drug sensitivity was determined with MTT assay. Cell cloning efficiency was evaluated by Colony-forming assay. Apoptotic cells were detected with annexin V staining and flow cytometry. Results In vitro drug sensitivity assay revealed that suppression of NDRG 2 could sensitize <b>Hela</b> <b>cells</b> to cisplatin. Down-regulation of NDRG 2 didn’t influence the colony-forming ability but promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis of <b>Hela</b> <b>cells.</b> Inhibition of NDRG 2 in <b>Hela</b> <b>cells</b> was accompanied by decreased Bcl- 2 protein level. However, Bcl- 2 mRNA level was not changed in <b>Hela</b> <b>cells</b> with down-regulation of NDRG 2. Further study indicated that miR- 15 b and miR- 16, two microRNAs targetting Bcl- 2, were significantly up-regulated in NDRG 2 -suppressed <b>Hela</b> <b>cells.</b> Conclusions These data suggested that down-regulation of NDRG 2 could enhance sensitivity of <b>Hela</b> <b>cells</b> to cisplatin through inhibiting Bcl- 2 protein expression, which might be mediated by up-regulating miR- 15 b and miR- 16. </p...|$|R
