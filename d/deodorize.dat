40|$|The <b>deodorizing</b> {{activity}} of dokudami (Houttuyniacordata Thunb.) for masking {{the odor of}} fresh garlic was investigated, and the volatility of the <b>deodorizing</b> compounds was examined. Two grams of garlic {{was placed in a}} beaker and heated for 5 min at 40 °C. Next, aliquots of 0. 01 and 0. 05 g of powdered samples of seven plants (dokudami, thyme, rosemary, coriander, dandelion, spiny sow thistle and green tea) were mixed with 1 ml of volatile or non-volatile dokudami extract and added to the garlic sample. The garlic odor intensity was subsequently evaluated by sniffing by 10 trained individuals. The <b>deodorizing</b> activity test was carried out at 0, 3 and 6 h after adding the dokudami extract. The <b>deodorizing</b> effect of dokudami on masking garlic odor was the highest of any plant and became higher with increased dose. In addition, the <b>deodorizing</b> {{activity of}} dokudami increased with time and persisted. Moreover, whether the <b>deodorizing</b> compounds of dokudami were volatile or non-volatile was investigated. The <b>deodorizing</b> activity of a volatile solution of dokudami against garlic was extremely higher than that of dokudami dry powder.

Two sets of blends were prepared by mixing an extra virgin olive oil with both refined and mild <b>deodorized</b> olive oils in increasing amounts. The obtained data highlighted that the triacylglycerol oligopolymers were absent or present in traces in the extra virgin olive oil, while their mean amount was equal to 0. 04 g/ 100 g and 0. 72 g/ 100 g in mild <b>deodorized</b> and refined olive oils, respectively. Oxidized triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols were more abundant in mild <b>deodorized</b> oil and refined oil than in extra virgin olive oil. The Factorial Discriminant Analysis of the data showed that the HPSEC analysis could reveal the presence of refined/mild <b>deodorized</b> oils in extra virgin olive oils. In particular, the classification functions obtained allowed designation of mixtures containing at least 30 g/ 100 g of mild <b>deodorized</b> oil and all those containing refined olive oil as <b>deodorized</b> oil, therefore as oils subjected to at least a mild refining treatment...|$|R

Grown bacterial colonies or waste released from human body are the main causes for odour in garments. To meet the consumer’s mature demand for hygienic clothing, extensive significant work has been published regarding the <b>deodorizing</b> property of textiles achieved with the application of natural colorants. The <b>deodorizing</b> performance of fabrics dyed with natural colorant extracts was comparatively studied and <b>deodorizing</b> efficiency of pomegranate was dominated among gardenia, Cassia tora. L., coffee sludge and pomegranate rind [129]. Gallnut dyed fabrics showed a better <b>deodorizing</b> function against ammonia, trimethyl amine and acetaldehyde, compared to the un-dyed fabrics. Also the dyed fabrics showed an excellent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumonia [130]. Cotton, silk and wool fabrics dyed with pomegranate (Punica granatum) extract by Young-Hee Lee and co-workers for <b>deodorizing</b> functionalization and found excellent results in range of 99 % [131]. Cotton fabrics were dyed with C. I. Direct Blue 200, a copper complex direct dye, and pre and post-mordanted with Cu(II) sulfate for deodorization of ethyl mercaptan. According to the results, all the deodorization effects plotted against the copper ion uptakes were found to increase quadratically with the copper ion uptake [132]. Thus, natural as well as synthetic dyes can be utilised for <b>deodorizing</b> functionalization of textiles by following proper protocol (optimized) of dyeing.|$|R

Semmelweis, still long before the germ theory of disease, had theorized that [...] "cadaveric particles" [...] were somehow transmitting decay from fresh cadavers to living patients, and he used the well-known Labarraque's solutions as the only known method to remove the smell of decay and tissue decomposition (which he found that soap did not). Coincidentally the solutions proved {{to be far more}} effective germicides and antiseptics than soap (Semmelweis only knew that soap was less effective, but not why), and the success of these chlorinated agents resulted in Semmelweis's (later) celebrated success in stopping the transmission of childbed fever.|$|E

When the police pulls Bobby over, asking for two things: vehicle registration and a license, Bobby responds that he didnt have them with him. This led Bobby to get arrested for his actions, have his mugshot taken, and be taken in for custody by the police. At the police station, Gary comes to bail Bobby out of jail and questions him what happened. Bobby reveals that the girl hes been seeing is pregnant. Gary tried to find various options to his situations, which Bobby doesnt agree with. However, they both work it out. Back stage of a concert, the group talks while smoking weed and discussing why the production company wants them to make changes to their image.

40|$|Summary: There are two {{approaches}} {{to the use of}} ozone in occupied spaces. The first one is that ozone has little ability to effectively <b>deodorize</b> indoor air and its use could have harmful health consequences. The second approach indicates that ozone in small concentrations can eliminate indoor air contaminants including odor pollutants. The paper presents the results of determination of the odor detection threshold concentrations Cth of n-butanol in mixtures with indoor air deodorized by ozone. The initial concentrations of n-butanol ranged from 0. 079 to 25. 312 mg/m 3. The doses of ozone that were used were lower than the ones permissible by standards and ranged from 0. 004 to 0. 042 ppm. The olfactometric method with sample dynamic dilution was applied during sensory assessments of the samples. The results discussed in the paper confirmed ozone’s deodorizing effects on the perception of n-butanol present in the indoor air.

But, unlike those other chocolate types, the cocoa solids are not recombined. As a result, this fat, cocoa butter, is the only cacao ingredient in white chocolate. Because it contains no cocoa solids, white chocolate contains only trace amounts of the stimulants theobromine and caffeine, while lacking the antioxidant properties or many characterizing ingredients of chocolate, such as thiamine, riboflavin, and phenylethylamine. Often, the cocoa butter is <b>deodorized</b> to remove its strong flavor.
