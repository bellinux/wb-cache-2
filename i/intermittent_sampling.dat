40|$|Summary: ? Marine {{microbes}} drive {{chemical reactions}} {{that contribute to}} Earth's habitability. ? Although molecular techniques are used to monitor oceanic microbial communities, collecting <b>intermittent</b> <b>samples</b> for laboratory analysis limits the usefulness of this approach. ? Instruments that collect and analyze microbes in situ can provide unprecedented resolution of biogeochemical cycles over large spatial and temporal scales. ? We should combine knowledge of key genes with new instruments to obtain time-series information on key marine microbial biogeochemical transformations. The oceans maintain critical ecosystems that, ultimately, determine the habitability of the planet. Moreover, unicellular eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea are the most abundant organisms within those ecosystems and thus the dominant biomass within the oceans, situated {{at the base of}} the food chain that feeds macroscopic invertebrates, fish, and mammals. We are only beginning to uncover the extent of marine microbial genetic diversity and the complex roles that these microbes play in driving the biogeochemistry of global ocean ecosystems. Molecular biology, genomics, microscopy, mass spectrometry, and high-throughput cultivation are already providing useful information on the diversity and activities of marine microflora, including new biochemical pathways. However, in the face of global environmental change, we need to gain a deeper understanding of the distributions of marine microbes and their activities in maintaining ecosystem functions...|$|R
40|$|Texto completo: acesso restrito. p. 537 - 543 Background: Longitudinal {{prevalence}} (ie, {{the proportion}} {{of time with the}} disease) is used to describe morbidity from diarrhea and other episodic conditions. The aim of this analysis was to compare estimates of longitudinal prevalence based on <b>intermittent</b> <b>sampling</b> at regular intervals with 24 - or 48 -hour recall, with estimates based on continuous surveillance. Methods: Based on 2 real datasets from Brazil and Guatemala, we developed a simulated dataset representing the diarrhea morbidity of 10, 000 individuals followed over 365 days. Results: Both the model and the real datasets showed that the standard deviation of the longitudinal prevalence increases with decreasing numbers of days sampled, so that a study sampling only a fraction of days would require a larger sample size. However, due to the correlation of diarrhea between consecutive days, sampling at 7 - to 14 -day intervals results in relatively small loss of precision and power compared with daily morbidity records, especially when the average diarrheal episode is long. A study based on morbidity data for every seventh day may require only a 5 %- 24 % larger sample size than a study with daily records, depending on the average duration of episodes. Using a recall period of 48 hours instead of 24 hours increases power if the average episode is short. Conclusions: The results question the necessity of continuous surveillance to estimate longitudinal prevalence. In addition to savings in cost and staff time, <b>intermittent</b> <b>sampling</b> of morbidity may improve validity by minimizing recall error and reducing the influence of surveillance on participants' behavior...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a shading jamming method for the Synthetic Aperture Radar and Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR-GMTI). This method begins with {{intermittently}} sampling intercepted SAR signals, performing motion modulation, and then transmitting them. The motion modulation of SAR signals can produce a motion modulation effect and <b>intermittent</b> <b>sampling</b> repeater jamming can produce multi-fronted and lagged false targets along a range. Their combination provides a jamming effect of smart shading areas, which can’t be cancelled after multi-channel cancelling. The uniqueness of this jamming method is that the energy only appears on the moving target to be covered, so less jamming energy is needed. We analyzed the proposed jamming principle against GMTI using the tri-channel interference cancelling technique.

30|$|Networked control {{dynamical}} systems (NCDSs) {{have been}} widely studied over the past decades [1 – 4]. It is usually investigated in the NCDSs that all oscillators approach a uniform dynamical behavior, that is, all the nodes in the NCDSs reach synchronization eventually. In the process of synchronization, the couplings among nodes and/or external distributed and cooperative control between nodes exist inevitably and meanwhile conflicts may exist due to the limitations of network resources and traffics [5]. In most previous references [6 – 8], each node received their neighbors’ information continuously, which may cost much. As an important component in NCDSs, <b>intermittent</b> <b>sampling</b> has emerged as an interesting topic to avoid communication continuously [9 – 11].

40|$|Although <b>intermittent</b> ECG <b>sampling</b> is a {{commonly}} used method for arrhythmia detection {{there are no}} controlled studies of its efficiency. In the present study a continuous ECG was recorded for three hours in 52 patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias. All ECGs were interpreted minute to minute to get the true arrhythmia content. <b>Intermittent</b> ECG <b>samples</b> were simulated by analyzing the first, first two and first five minutes of every 15 minutes in the ECG material. Two minute long ECG samples were also used every 30 minutes. The 15 and 30 minute long periods were classified as containing arrhythmias or not according to the arrhythmia content of the samples. These findings were subsequently compared with the true arrhythmia content. The arrhythmia detection rate depends on the sampling time and true arrhythmia oc-currence. The distribution of arrhythmias within the periods was also of importance. With a five minute long ECG sample about 80 % of the intervals containing any type of ventricular tachyarrhythmia will be detected. This is reduced to about 50 % when one minute long ECG strips are used.

We analyzed 63 patient-years of ECG data from 8, 105 acute care patient admissions at a tertiary care academic medical center. We developed models to predict deterioration resulting in ICU transfer or unanticipated death within the next 24 hours using either vital signs, laboratory results, or cardiorespiratory dynamics from continuous ECG monitoring and also evaluated models using all available data sources. We calculated the predictive validity (C-statistic), the net reclassification improvement, and the probability of achieving the difference in likelihood ratio χ 2 for the additional degrees of freedom. The primary outcome occurred 755 times in 586 admissions (7 %). We analyzed 395 clinical deteriorations with continuous ECG data in the 24 hours prior to an event. Using only continuous ECG measures resulted in a C-statistic of 0. 65, similar to models using only laboratory results and vital signs (0. 63 and 0. 69 respectively). Addition of continuous ECG measures to models using conventional measurements improved the C-statistic by 0. 01 and 0. 07; a model integrating all data sources had a C-statistic of 0. 73 with categorical net reclassification improvement of 0. 09 for a change of 1 decile in risk.

With the {{maturation}} {{and certification}} of several ballast water management systems that employ chlorine as biocide {{to prevent the}} spread of invasive species, there is a clear need for accurate and reliable total residual oxidants (TRO) technology to monitor treatment dose and assure the environmental safety of treated water discharged from ships. In this study, instruments used to measure TRO in wastewater and drinking water applications were evaluated for their performance in scenarios mimicking a ballast water treatment application (e. g., diverse hold times, temperatures, and salinities). Parameters chosen for testing these technologies in the past do not reflect conditions expected during ballast water treatment.
