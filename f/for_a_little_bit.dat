500|$|After {{passing on}} using Renault's new power {{unit in the}} United States and Mexico, Red Bull {{equipped}} Daniel Ricciardo's car with the new specification unit, which earned him a ten-place grid penalty in the process. Once he had tried the new unit during the free practice and qualifying sessions, Ricciardo lamented that the upgrade had not improved the performance. He said: [...] "In hindsight, it didn't give us any laptime, it's just for now a penalty <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of knowledge."

Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Pictures) expects a miracle – and we're going to make it happen." [...] Sargent got a call from Sheinberg in late September 1986, asking him to direct the fourth Jaws movie with no script yet written. Said Sargent, [...] "I didn't have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. When he told me, 'It's your baby, you produce and direct,' I accepted." [...] According to Sargent, Sheinberg [...] "cut through all the slow lanes and got Jaws: The Revenge off and running." [...] In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born [...] "out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Mosley {{represented}} FOCA in the [...] "FISA-FOCA War", {{a conflict between}} FOCA, representing the mainly UK-based independent teams, and FISA, which {{was supported by the}} [...] "grandee" [...] constructors owned by road car manufacturers (primarily Alfa Romeo, Ferrari and Renault). In 1981, FOCA announced its own World Federation of Motor Sport and ran the non-championship 1981 South African Grand Prix. The staging of this event, with worldwide television coverage, helped persuade Jean-Marie Balestre, the FISA president, that FISA would have to negotiate a settlement with FOCA. As Mosley has since commented: [...] "We were absolutely [...] If Balestre could have held the manufacturer's support <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> longer, the constructors would have been on their knees. The outcome would then have been very different." [...] Mosley helped draw up the Concorde Agreement, a document which resolved the dispute by essentially giving FISA control of the rules and FOCA control of commercial and television rights. The most recent version of the Concorde Agreement expired on 31 December 2007, and a new one was being discussed, as of 2008. In 1982, the year after the first Concorde Agreement was signed, Mosley left his role at FOCA, and Formula One, to work for the Conservative Party.|$|E

500|$|Early in {{the writing}} process, Donegan created guitar riffs. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote {{the rest of the}} music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, [...] "The writing process is... pretty much the same since the beginning... of this band. It's always been riffs; {{something}} musically that I'll come up with [...]" [...] Wengren commented, [...] "We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really until we get home and we are able to clear our minds, decompress <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life." [...] Bassist John Moyer left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, [...] "When the basic guitar, bass, [...] drums were being laid down, at first I didn't really see a whole lot of room for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics." ...|$|E

Burton was ruled out for two to three months with a medial ligament injury suffered in this match, resulting in his loan at the club being curtailed. York signed 19-year-old Middlesbrough defender Brad Halliday on a one-month loan as cover and competition for McCoy. Fellow strugglers Oxford United won 1–0 at York, James Roberts scoring from threeyards after Danny Hylton flicked on a Brian Howard corner in the 35th minute, and Wilcox surmised the result saying [...] "The lads are working as hard as they possibly can but I'm just looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> more now".|$|E
