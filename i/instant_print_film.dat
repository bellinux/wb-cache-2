40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{abstract}} is to document and explain an exhibition of photographic art work using the now extinct Kodak <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> <b>film.</b> The exhibition resulted from using what were probably the last 100 unexposed pieces of Kodak PR- 144 <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> <b>film</b> available in Southern California, and possibly the last available in the country. The exhibition took place April 3 - 10, 1987 in the North Art Gallery of California State University, Northridge. The imagery in this exhibition evolved from my interest in working with the immediate feedback associated with exposing and manipulating Polaroid SX- 70 and Kodak PR- 144 <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> <b>film...</b>|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{curriculum}} {{strategies can}} be used to conduct an effective photography program without the expense usually associated with _a darkroom. Three methods {{can be used}} to eliminate the need for a. darkroom facility: outside vendors, an emulsion that can be user-processed without access to a darkroom (slide or transparency film), and emulsions that self-develop outside the camera (<b>instant</b> <b>print</b> <b>film).</b> All three strategies emphasize the picture-taking rather than the mechanical processes of producing a viewable result. If an outside vendor is used, students need instruction on how to seek out services, how to evaluate services, and how to place orders. Advantages are a wider range of services, lower costs, better quality, and time for other aspects of photography. Disadvantages may be cost, turn-around time, nd loss of control over end result. Advantages of the user-processed emulsion are the need for some darkroom experiences, reduced time, lower costs, and control over end result. Disadvantages are processing errors, variations, and no quality controls. Advantages of <b>instant</b> <b>print</b> <b>film</b> are immediacy, low cost, and good results. A disadvantage is that the cameras using this film are usually automatic for exposure control and sometimes for focusing. (Resources and sources are cited.)

Often such systems will only print 4x6 inch prints, although popular dye sublimation photo printers as of 2008 allow for 4x6, 5x7, 8x10, 8x12.

40|$|Whilst <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> are {{currently}} used in varied devices {{across a wide}} range of fields, research into their development and properties is increasingly uncovering even greater potential. <b>Printed</b> <b>films</b> provides comprehensive coverage of the most significant recent developments in <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> and their applications. Materials and properties of <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> are the focus of part one, beginning with a review of the concepts, technologies and materials involved in their production and use. <b>Printed</b> <b>films</b> as electrical components and silicon metallization for solar cells are discussed, as are conduction mechanisms in <b>printed</b> <b>film</b> resistors, and thick films in packaging and microelectronics. Part two goes on to review the varied applications of <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> in devices. <b>Printed</b> resistive sensors are considered, as is the role of <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> in capacitive, piezoelectric and pyroelectric sensors, mechanical micro-systems and gas sensors. The applications of <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> in biosensors, actuators, heater elements, varistors and polymer solar cells are then explored, followed by a review of screen printing for the fabrication of solid oxide fuel cells, and laser printed micro- and meso-scale power generating devices...|$|R

For adhesion test samples, the images were derived from the <b>printed</b> <b>film</b> parts where the tapes had been peeled off. For rub resistance test samples, the <b>printed</b> <b>film</b> parts that were rubbed by the rub tester were selected and cropped.

5000|$|The IMAX {{format is}} generically called [...] "15/70" [...] film, the name {{referring}} to the 15 sprocket holes or perforations per frame. The film's bulk requires horizontal platters, rather than conventional film reels. IMAX platters range from 1.2 to 1.83 m diameter to accommodate 1 to 2.75 hours of film. Platters with a 2.5 hour feature film weigh 250 kg. IMAX uses ESTAR-based <b>print</b> <b>film</b> in their 15/70 rolling-loop film projection systems. ESTAR-based <b>print</b> <b>film</b> provides greater precision. The chemical development process {{does not change the}} size or shape of ESTAR <b>print</b> <b>film,</b> and IMAX's pin registration system (especially the camera mechanism) does not tolerate either sprocket-hole or film-thickness variations. On September 1, 2016, it announced plans to include Virtual Reality into the IMAX theater experience with the opening of a new VR center in Los Angeles using a new StarVR headset created by Acer.|$|R

The developed wet chemical precipitation method allows the synthesis of metal nanoparticles by a high yield. Based on these nanoparticles customized eco-friendly water based inks are formulated. These inks show a high compatibility with the printing process and a high shelf life. Critical ink and printing parameters are summarized and discussed. Due to the fact, that the industry uses a variety of electronic and sensory substrates, a method to adapt the curing temperature to low (polymer), middle (glass) and high temperature (ceramic) substrates for the printing of electronic conductors and sensor electrodes is presented. Important physical and chemical ink specifications like particle size, viscosity, surface tension, sedimentation stability as well as electronic conductivities and adhesion of <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> will be shown. Especially, solutions to optimize the adhesion, curing and electronic conductivity of <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> on low temperature substrates like PET are presented. Usually <b>printing</b> <b>films</b> are cured in conventional belt furnace. Here, we present a new millisecond functionalization technique, based on a line laser system. Thereby, the rapid curing of <b>printed</b> <b>films</b> on thermal sensitive substrates for R 2 R process is presented...|$|R
