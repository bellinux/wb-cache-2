5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} TB <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> identifying M. tuberculosis {{in a clinical}} sample (e.g., sputum, pus, or a tissue biopsy). However, the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture. Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Carbon fiber <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> {{pyrolysis}} of extruded {{and stretched}} filaments of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical {{properties of the}} fiber depend {{on the type of}} starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel.|$|E
5|$|Cocktails {{similar to}} the pisco sour include the Chilean Piscola and the Peruvian Algarrobina Cocktail. Piscola <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> mixing pisco with cola.

5|$|The Simpson and Suwannee points, {{found in}} Florida and the Southeastern United States, {{are similar to}} the Golondrina in shape and age. The Dalton point, found in the central United States, shares a similar outline and basal corner auriculation with Golondrina, which may imply that {{they are part of a}} series. Identification <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> {{examination}} of the blade edges—Golondrina exhibits much less serration. The Meserve type has also been known to cause confusion, as it is considered a resharpened variant of the Plainview and Golondrina types.|$|E
5|$|A fluffernutter <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> {{spreading}} {{peanut butter}} on {{a slice of}} bread, then spreading {{an equal amount of}} marshmallow fluff on another slice and finally combining them to form a sandwich. Variations of the recipe include wheat bread instead of white, Nutella hazelnut spread instead of or in addition to peanut butter, and the addition of sweet ingredients like bananas or savory and salty ingredients like bacon. The Fluffernutter itself is often seen as a variation on the peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Though often seen as a food for children, the Fluffernutter recipe has been adapted to appeal to adult tastes. For example, a New York caterer serves a Fluffernutter hors d'oeuvre in a toasted ice cream cone with a spoon of peanut butter and torched marshmallow fluff on top.|$|E
5|$|A kilim is an Islamic flatwoven carpet (without a pile), {{whether for}} {{household}} use or a prayer mat. The pattern <b>is</b> <b>made</b> <b>by</b> winding the weft threads {{back over the}} warp threads when a colour boundary is reached. This technique leaves a gap or vertical slit, so kilims are sometimes called slit-woven textiles. Kilims are often decorated with geometric patterns with 2- or 4-fold mirror or rotational symmetries. Because weaving uses vertical and horizontal threads, curves are difficult to generate, and patterns are accordingly formed mainly with straight edges. Kilim patterns are often characteristic of specific regions. Kilim motifs are often symbolic as well as decorative. For example, the wolf's mouth or wolf's foot motif (Turkish: Kurt Aǧzi, Kurt İzi) expresses the tribal weavers' desires for protection of their families' flocks from wolves.|$|E
