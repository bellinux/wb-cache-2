5|$|Although the {{parasite}} responsible for P.falciparum malaria has been <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of {{the parasite}} did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E

The Basingstoke Concert Band is a traditional wind band which has now been <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> more than 35 years. The band was started by Lawrie Shaw when Brighton Hill Community School opened in Basingstoke in 1975 {{where he was the}} first headteacher. Lawrie formed the band as an evening class for amateur wind players and it was then known as the Brighton Hill Centre Band. In the years immediately after World War II the Basingstoke Symphony Orchestra was being conducted by D. Cecil Williams.|$|E
5|$|In botany, a tree is a {{perennial}} plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, {{the definition of}} a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. In looser definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees have been <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.|$|E
5|$|Jackson and Walsh {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} The Frighteners during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Executive producer Robert Zemeckis hired the duo to write the script, with the original intention of Zemeckis directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, Tales from the Crypt. With Jackson and Walsh's first draft submitted in January 1994, Zemeckis believed the film {{would be better off}} directed by Jackson, produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Studios. The visual effects were created by Jackson's Weta Digital, which had only been <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> three years. This, plus the fact that The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made until that time, resulted in the eighteen-month period for effects work by Weta Digital being largely stressed.|$|E

5|$|The breed was {{originally}} a multipurpose horse, used for agriculture, cavalry and pulling diligences (a type of carriage). Because {{of a lack}} of support from a breeding syndicate, such as the one <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> the Mérens horse, once the need for a multipurpose breed declined, the population of the Castillonnais dwindled. Many horses were crossbred with draft horses, and the breed almost became extinct. The intervention of a group of supporters in 1980 saved the breed from extinction, and in 1992 L'Association Pyrénéenne Ariégeoise du Cheval Castillonnais (the Ariege Pyrenees Association of Castillonnais Horses) was formed, with support from several French government agencies and stud farms. Annually, in August, the association holds a small competition and sale for the breed in Castillon-en-Couserans, which also includes inspections to register horses for the breed studbook.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} Douglas {{attracted}} commissions from wealthy and important patrons.

She was the sister-in-law of Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere, and {{it was from the}} 2ndBaron that Douglas received his first major commission, a considerable rebuilding of the south wing of his seat at Vale Royal Abbey in 1860. Around the same time, Lord Delamere commissioned him to build the church of St John the Evangelist at Over, Winsford, as a memorial to his first wife.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E

5|$|Parliament {{and many}} {{concerned}} reformers had been attempting {{to improve the}} housing of the working classes since the early 1830s. When Hill began her work, the model dwelling movement had been <b>in</b> <b>existence</b> <b>for</b> twenty years, royal and select committees had sat to examine the problems of urban well-being, and {{the first of many}} tranches of legislation aimed at improving working class housing had been passed. From Hill's point of view these had all failed the poorest members of the working class, the unskilled labourers. She found that their landlords routinely ignored their obligations towards their tenants, and that the tenants were too ignorant and oppressed to better themselves. She tried to find new homes for her charges, but there was a severe shortage of available property, and Hill decided that her only solution was to become a landlord herself. John Ruskin, who was interested in the co-operative guild, knew Hill from her work as his copyist and was impressed by her. As an aesthete and a humanitarian he was affronted by the brutal ugliness of the slums. In 1865, having inherited a substantial sum of money from his father, he acquired for £750 the leases of three cottages of six rooms each in Paradise Place, Marylebone.|$|E
