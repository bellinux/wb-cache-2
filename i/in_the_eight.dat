5|$|As with {{internment}} in 1971 and Bloody Sunday in 1972, IRA recruitment was boosted, {{resulting in}} a new surge of paramilitary activity. There was an upsurge of violence after the comparatively quiet years of the late 1970s, with widespread civil disorder in Northern Ireland and rioting outside the British Embassy in Dublin. Security forces fired 29,695 plastic bullets in 1981, causing seven deaths, compared {{to a total of}} around 16,000 bullets and four deaths <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eight</b> years following the hunger strikes.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, a bounty was levied on J.lagostoma {{in order to reduce}} its numbers. Hunters were paid 6 pence (alternatively paid in rum) for every hundred claws collected.

The current population is much smaller, and the low level of recruitment and lack of juveniles suggests that the species may become endangered.|$|E

5|$|Bockscar {{had been}} flown by Sweeney and crew C-15 in three test drop rehearsals of inert Fat Man {{assemblies}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eight</b> {{days leading up}} to the second mission, including the final rehearsal the day before. The Great Artiste, which was the assigned aircraft of the crew with whom Sweeney most often flew, had been designated in preliminary planning to drop the second bomb, but the aircraft had been fitted with observation instruments for the Hiroshima mission. Moving the instrumentation from The Great Artiste to Bockscar would have been a complex and time-consuming process, and when the second atomic bomb mission was moved up from 11 August to 9 August because of adverse weather forecasts, the crews of The Great Artiste and Bockscar instead exchanged aircraft. The result was that the bomb was carried by Bockscar, but flown by the crew C-15 of The Great Artiste.|$|E
5|$|Clyde Fenton, {{known for}} his {{exploits}} as a flying doctor in the Northern Territory before being commissioned as a pilot in the RAAF, served as an instructor at No.3 EFTS from mid-1940 to early 1942. King was posted to command No.5 EFTS at Narromine, New South Wales, in December 1940. By this time No.3 EFTS was reported as having graduated 200 pilots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eight</b> flying training courses it had run since its formation. One of its graduates was Nicky Barr, who become a fighter ace in the North African Campaign with twelve victories to his credit. No.3 EFTS began operating a ground-based Link Trainer on 17February 1941. The school started flying the recently introduced CAC Wackett Trainer in August 1941, but the type proved troublesome, delaying the training program. From September to November 1941, a detachment of personnel from No.11 EFTS also utilised training facilities at Essendon, after their home aerodrome at Benalla had been inundated by heavy rain. No.3 EFTS's instructors, students and Wackett Trainers were transferred to No.11 EFTS during April 1942, and the Essendon school was disbanded on 1May.|$|E
5|$|Despite an {{emergency}} appendectomy that delayed his spring training and shortened {{his time to}} get in shape for the season, Hershiser had been named NL Baseball Pitcher of the Month in April and a participant in the 1988 All-Star Game, getting outs against all three batters. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>eight</b> games he started between July 10 and August 14, Hershiser had a 3–4 win–loss record with a 4.76 earned run average (ERA), raising his season ERA from 2.46 to 3.06. Following his August 14 start in which he left the game after two innings (his shortest appearance since 1985) with the Dodgers behind the Giants 8–2, he pitched complete games on August 19 (a shutout) and August 24. Prior to the game, Hershiser trailed teammate Tim Leary in shutouts, six to three, and Leary also combined with other pitchers to record a shutout that was not counted in his individual total.|$|E

5|$|During {{the latter}} half of the eighth century, the Northumbrian {{succession}} included a long series of murdered and deposed kings, as several royal lines contended for the throne. The main lines were those of Eadberht, Æthelwald Moll and Alhred. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>eight</b> years before Eardwulf's accession, all three of these dynastic lines were involved in the struggle for kingship: on 23 September 788, King Ælfwald I, grandson of Eadberht, was murdered by the patricius Sicga near Hexham, and Ælfwald's cousin Osred became king. Osred, who was of Alhred's line, was deposed after a year, and Æthelred, son of Æthelwald Moll, who had been deposed in 778 at a young age, was restored to the kingship, resuming the title Æthelred I.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, Cotillo {{had opposed}} the anti-immigration {{restrictions}} of the Immigration Act of 1924 that significantly limited immigration from Italy. In 1931, Cotillo protested against unnecessary stringent {{requirements of a}} proposed registration law, particularly the requirement of {{the equivalent of a}} public school education and the fingerprinting of applicants. A naturalized citizen had the same rights as native-born and fingerprinting would make the foreign applicant feel like a criminal, Cotillo pointed out. He referred to the findings of the Wickersham Commission that the foreign-born committed considerably less crime than native citizens. He also attacked the revocation of citizenship because of evil doing, while a native born was not affected. At the time, Cotillo claimed to have naturalized some 25,000 immigrants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eight</b> years he had been on the bench.|$|E
5|$|In 1725 the Qing Yongzheng Emperor {{bestowed}} the hereditary {{title of}} Marquis on {{a descendant of}} the Ming dynasty Imperial family, Zhu Zhilian (朱之璉), who received a salary from the Qing government and whose duty was to perform rituals at the Ming tombs, and was also inducted the Chinese Plain White Banner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Eight</b> Banners. Later the Qianlong Emperor bestowed the title Marquis of Extended Grace posthumously on Zhu Zhilian in 1750, and the title passed on through twelve generations of Ming descendants {{until the end of}} the Qing dynasty in 1912. The last Marquis of Extended Grance was Zhu Yuxun (朱煜勳). In 1912, after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution, some advocated that a Han Chinese be installed as Emperor, either the descendant of Confucius, who was the Duke Yansheng, or the Ming dynasty Imperial family descendant, the Marquis of Extended Grace.|$|E

5|$|Poulton {{struggled}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eight</b> WNCL matches {{during the}} 2007–08 season, scoring 106 runs at 13.25 with a best of 39 against Western Australia. She took her best bowling figures at senior level, claiming 3/10 {{in the second}} match against Western Australia. Poulton captured three lower-order wickets in quick succession as Western Australia lost 4/10 to be all out for 141. However, Poulton was then bowled for a golden duck from the first ball of the innings from Lauren Ebsary as New South Wales lost the match by 37 runs. Poulton ended the season with four wickets at 8.75 at an economy rate of 3.75. New South Wales reached the final and were awarded the title because they placed first in the qualifying matches after rain washed out the deciding game without a ball being bowled. She also played in two Twenty20 interstate matches, top-scoring with 69 in the first match against South Australia, before making 35 against Western Australia; New South Wales won both games. After her poor WNCL season, Poulton was overlooked for Australian selection for the home series against England and then the Rose Bowl tour of New Zealand that followed.|$|E
5|$|The 1999–00 {{season was}} the club's final {{year at the}} Ice Stadium {{before moving to the}} National Ice Centre. The budget for players was limited by the club {{chairman}} so that the Panthers would be able to break even the following season. Players were asked to take a wage cut, leading to the departure of Trevor Robins, Mike Bishop, Mark Kolesar, Eric Dubios and record goalscorer Paul Adey. This frustrated Mike Blaisdell who left the club in November to become head coach of the Sheffield Steelers. He was replaced by former coach Alex Dampier. Lacking the spending power of many of their rivals, Nottingham finished sixth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>eight</b> team league. The club fared better in the Challenge Cup where it made the final for the second successive year but the team was defeated 2–1 at London Arena by Mike Blaisdell's Steelers. On 22 March 2000 the Panthers hosted Newcastle in their final game at the Ice Stadium.
