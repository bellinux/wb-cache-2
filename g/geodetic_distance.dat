40|$|International audienceThis work {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of integrating the geographical elements such as orography and presence of water bodies {{as well as the}} latitudinal effects into an effective distance when interpolating meteorological fields. This effective distance may then be used in any interpolation methods instead of the standard <b>geodetic</b> <b>distance.</b> Several hundreds of sites are used in Europe to assess the benefits of several effective distances. The meteorological parameters under concern are ten-years averages of monthly means of daily sum of horizontal global irradiation, daily sum of sunshine duration, daily extremes of air temperature, atmospheric pressure and water vapor pressure, and of monthly sums of precipitation. This work demonstrates that taking into account the latitudinal effects in the distance increases the accuracy in interpolation. Such effects have been seldom mentioned in previous publications. The orographic effects may be partly corrected by adding the weighted difference in elevation to the <b>geodetic</b> <b>distance.</b> The proposed effective distance between the point P and each of the measuring sites Xi for all parameters, is found to give better results than the others...|$|E

30|$|In Figure  2 b {{only the}} length of the sides and one {{diagonal}} of a quadrilateral have been measured, and no coordinates are known. The available data permit to define the geometry (shape and dimensions) of the quadrilateral, but the coordinates of its corner points cannot be computed. This example is representative of a large category of underdetermined systems of equations, reflecting a datum defect. In the past, this defect was usual before the advent of GPS in tectonics studies, because the available <b>geodetic</b> observations of <b>distances</b> and of angles did not permit estimations of absolute displacements. Still, the addition of some constraints (additional information for coordinates or for fault-slip) permitted to overpass the datum defect (Brunner 1979; Prescott 1981).|$|R
40|$|In open-pit mines, {{monitoring}} of topographic and volumetric changes through time {{is found to}} be of great importance to support excavation stages and to plan rehabilitation strategies. In this work, we describe a geomatic approach to assess changes in surface mine extent and to quantify excavated volume in the Sa Pigada open-pit mine, Sardinia, Italy. We performed two drone-based photogrammetric surveys in 2013 and 2015, and by means of the Structure from Motion (SfM) technique, we obtained related 3 D dense point clouds and digital orthophotos. Images were georeferenced thanks to a series of ground control points surveyed with <b>geodetic</b> GPS. <b>Distances</b> between the two clouds were estimated with the recent Multiscale Model to Model Cloud Comparison (M 3 C 2) plug-in included in the CloudCompare open-source software. Starting from cloud-to-cloud distances, we calculated the excavated volume of mineral resources between the two surveys. Results of the M 3 C 2 comparison supported the analysis of the two orthophotos, through which accurate limits of the 2013 and 2015 active mine areas, rehabilitated area and temporary dumps were identified and drawn in a digital map. Results obtained in this study suggest that the applied geomatic techniques are suitable for performing accurate change detection analysis in open-pit environments and represent a valid support for scientists and technicians allowing to monitor with high spatial and temporal resolutions. This approach can be also considered a valid tool to reduce environmental impact from mining...|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{processes}} such as {{earthquakes and}} volcanoes occur on different spatial and temporal scales. To understand the behaviour of these processes, scientists look closely for precursory signals. One of these signals is ground deformation, which can be geodetically measured and then described by strain rate. To measure horizontal or vertical strain rate accurately, very precise <b>geodetic</b> observations of <b>distance,</b> position or height must be made, preferably {{with a high level}} of repeatability. The most precise estimations of strain rate are achieved with geodetic observations collected and averaged for periods extending up to a decade. Presently, a number of geodetic instruments are used for this purpose, which include differential levelling, the Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) and Global Positioning System (GPS). Each of these instruments is capable of detecting very small amounts of strain and ground movement; however they may be limited by their spatial and temporal resolution. This paper examines the use of these instruments and techniques and critically examines their advantages and disadvantages in this field. The increasing use of large-scale geodetic monitoring networks around the world is investigated. Recent catastrophic events in Sumatra, Haiti and Japan highlight that measuring and correctly interpreting ground deformation from these networks in the years, months, days or hours leading to these events is critically important...|$|R

Although a 10 #radian postearthquake tilt change was recorded at a nearby tiltmeter, no significant change in geodetic distances could be detected at a sensitivity of at least 0. 5 ppm. A simple dislocation model of the main earth-quake in the swarm would predict no observable change in either tilt or <b>geodetic</b> <b>distance...</b>|$|E

In this article, the concept of geodetic interval in graphs is extended to fuzzy graphs.

The axiomatic definition of intervals in fuzzy graphs are used to define intervals in different fuzzy graph structures like fuzzy trees and complete fuzzy graphs.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{alignment of}} the silicon detector modules of the ATLAS semiconductor tracker will need remote monitoring during operation, within a high radiation environment. A <b>geodetic</b> grid of <b>distance</b> measurement fibre-coupled interferometers will monitor changes {{in the shape of}} the support structure. Eight hundred fibre-coupled grid line interferometers (GLIs) will be compared simultaneously to a stable, evacuated reference interferometer using Frequency Scanning Interferometry (FSI). The GLIs, (from 70 mm to 1400 mm long, with pW level return signals) must be measured to a precision of 1 micron, to reconstruct the grid shape, in three dimensions, to a precision of 10 microns. In this work two important limitations were overcome : 1. Inflated errors due to relative interferometer drift were significantly reduced using two lasers scanned in opposite directions. 2. The fine tuning range was effectively extended by linking the phase information in two 30 GHz fine tuning subscans, separated by a 3. 5 THz coarse tuning interval. A demonstration system was built using tunable laser diodes operating at wavelengths close to 836 nm. Several different fibre coupled GLIs were built. Each was measured against an invar reference interferometer sharing the same laboratory air. The 400 mm GLI was measured to a (one standard deviation) precision of 120 nm and a 1195 mm GLI to a precision of 215 nm. Decreasing the GLI signal was not found to significantly degrade the measurement precision. Spurious reflections and vibrations were separately introduced to degrade the measurements. The errors were found to increase, with errors larger than 4 parts per million, observed for vibrations of 400 nm peak to peak amplitude. Suggestions are given for reducing remaining errors. Further investigations into the effects of vibrations and spurious reflections are recommended.

In this paper, we propose Unsupervised Multimodal Graph Mining (UMGM) to learn the discriminative features for probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) mosaics of breast tissue. We build a multiscale multimodal graph based on both pCLE mosaics and histology images. The positive pairs are mined via cycle consistency and the negative pairs are extracted based on <b>geodetic</b> <b>distance.</b> Given {{the positive and negative}} pairs, the latent feature space is discovered by reconstructing the similarity between pCLE and histology images. Experiments on a database with 700 pCLE mosaics demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous works on pCLE feature learning.

40|$|A <b>geodetic</b> <b>distance</b> {{measuring}} apparatus which compensates for the refractive {{index of the}} atmosphere is discussed. A mode locked laser system with a laser device and its peripheral components is utilized to derive two mutually phase locked optical wavelength signals and one phase locked microwave CW signal which respectively traverse the same distance measurement path. The optical signals are comprised of pulse type signals. Phase comparison of the two optical wavelength pulse signals is used to provide the dry air density while phase comparison {{of one of the}} optical wavelength pulse signals and the microwave CW signal issued to provide wet or water vapor density of the air. The distance to be measured corrected for the atmospheric dry air and water vapor densities in the measurement path is computed from these measurements.

40|$|More than 700, 000 trips {{were made}} by {{residents}} in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (EWNI) in 2015 to tropical countries endemic for yellow fever, a potentially deadly, yet vaccine-preventable disease transmitted by mosquitoes. The {{aim of this study}} was to map the geographical accessibility of yellow fever vaccination centres (YFVC) in EWNI. The location of 3208 YFVC were geocoded and the average <b>geodetic</b> <b>distance</b> to nearest YFVC was calculated for each population unit. Data on trips abroad and centres were obtained regionally for EWNI and nationally for the World Top 20 countries in terms of travel. The mean distance to nearest YFVC was 2. 4  km and only 1 % of the population had to travel more than 16. 1  km to their nearest centre. The number of vaccines administered regionally in EWNI was found correlated with the number of trips to yellow fever countries. The number of centres per 100, 000 trips was 6. 1 in EWNI, which was below United States (12. 1) and above the rest of Top 20 countries. The service availability was in line with demand regionally. With the exception of remote, rural areas, yellow fever vaccination services were widely available with only short distances to cover for the travelling public.
