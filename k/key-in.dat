A little stately, perhaps; a little apprêté and {{conscious}} that they are speaking to whole generations who are listening; but in the tone of their voices—pitched, as no doubt they are, beyond the mere conversation <b>key—in</b> the expression of their thoughts, their various views and natures, there is something generous, and cheering, and ennobling. You are in the society of men who have filled the greatest parts in the world’s story—you are with St. John the statesman; Peterborough the conqueror; Swift, the greatest wit of all times; Gay, the kindliest laugher—it is a privilege to sit in that company. Delightful and generous banquet! with a little faith and a little fancy any one of us here may enjoy it, and conjure up those great figures out of the past, and listen to their wit and wisdom. Mind that there is always a certain cachet about great men—they may be as mean on many points as you or I, but they carry their great air—they speak of common life more largely and generously than common men do—they regard the world with a manlier countenance, and see its real features more fairly than the timid shufflers who only dare to look up at life through blinkers, or to have an opinion when there is a crowd to back it. He who reads these noble records of a past age, salutes and reverences the great spirits who adorn it. You may go home now and talk with St. John; you may take a volume from your library and listen to Swift and Pope.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deal with}} {{developing}} inventory management and payment system using RFID {{as a medium}} of data transfer. Every retail outlet such as supermarket and shop worldwide has their own inventory management and payment system. It is important that both of the system work together to ensure precise and accurate item flow in and out and to ensure no mistake in payment process and in inventory management. Traditional inventory system and payment system using price tag and barcode usually fail to integrate together to deliver up-to-date inventory and also slow down the payment process. To overcome this,Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) or Automatic Identification and Mobility (AIM) technology is chosen {{to be used as}} a medium of data exchange. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is chosen to get precise and up-to-date inventory information and ensures faster payment process.

40|$|The core of {{this paper}} is {{reflecting}} actual language use as the "performance" of the language learners. The areas of investigation involves examining the structural linguistics patterns used by the language learners while preparing the essays, in terms of using the part-of-speech (POS) and the sentence level syntactical analysis of the most frequently used POS, which reflects the distributional patterns of the linguistic components used. The methodology applied is fundamental as it tends to investigate the linguistic components in the compiled genre-specific corpus. Computer-based syntactical studies are limited as it requires hard work and long hours in order to <b>key-in</b> the data {{and then there is the}} complex analytic method of describing the findings. This paper presents steps taken for corpus compilation and moves identification of the written Malaysian University English Test, in short MUET. It comprises a move analysis and a multidimensional analysis conducted using a compiled representative corpus of MUET essays. As a descriptive and a corpus-based study, it explored the written essays produced by ESL learners in three matriculation colleges in Malaysia. Language and language use are commonly analyzed for competence and performance. Competence is best described as the internalized linguistic knowledge as acquired by the learners while the notion of "performance" is best defined as the external evidence of language competence. This paper proposes structural linguistics investigations such as frequency analyses, sentence level syntactical analyses, distributional patterns of sentence level linguistic structural patterns and subject-verb agreement analyses reflecting the writers’ knowledge of applying their grammatical linguistics knowledge into their written output in various different contexts...|$|E
40|$|Maximising {{revenues}} {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges of regional airports especially after the introduction of deregulation and privatisation of airports with the increase of aggressive competition in the markets. The calculation of aeronautical revenues generation has always been considered as a straightforward method and airport managers generally overlooked on the importance of daily operational factors such as the different flight services offered at the airports, the type of aircraft airlines utilised, time of the day the flight arrives or departs, and the number of passengers the airlines ferry in and out of their airport, types of destination and how these factors influence the generation of aeronautical revenues for their airport. The first objective of this research is to measure the airside operation factors that influence the generation of aeronautical revenues deterministically. The influential variables were determined through literature reviews and case studies of regional airports in the Netherlands and Malaysia, and were validated with regression analysis. Preliminary model was developed based on the determinants and the model was analysed using Bayesian Network theory. Thus, the research is also geared towards developing a baseline matrix using stochastic approach to analyse the effect of airside operation factors on aeronautical revenues generation as the second objective. The next objective concerns with the formulation of mathematical optimisation algorithm known as Aeronautical Revenue Optimisation Model (AROM) to generate maximum aeronautical revenues for regional airport in line with the objectives of the airport. Finally, the research embarks on developing a graphical user interface (GUI) tool based on the model to estimate the possible potential aeronautical revenues that could be generated which will be useful for airport managers in their decision making. The GUI for AROM is a user friendly tool which allows airport managers to <b>key-in</b> the main input parameters such as mode of operations (arrival or departure), traffic types (Schedule, Business, Charter, etc.), flights details (day or night, weekday or weekend, number of passengers, international or domestic), fleet types (aircraft weight and engine type) and type of flights (domestic or international) in order to determine the composition offlight operations that produces optimum aeronautical revenues that could be achieved. Results obtained show that the maximum revenue achieved is based on flights composition, which is more focused towards certain types of traffic types with higher frequency for each of them in contrast to the current practise of offering small number of all sorts of traffic types. The model developed in this research is flexible; it allows decision makers to set the upper bound of flight constraints. The model can also be extended to include bigger sets of flight details, for example, to have day, evening and night flight instead of just day and night. Aside from that, the parameter can also be generalised such as to consider all international flights instead of domestic and international. The traffic types can also be adjusted to include shorter or longer list of traffic types to suit the airport's services...|$|E
40|$|It {{seems that}} {{everywhere}} {{one looks at}} present, the notion of 'identity' is being discussed. From very dense intellectual publications to the popular press; from Pete Townsend asking, in the Who's classic 1978 track, 'Who Are You?' to Sandra Bullock's invisibility {{as a result of}} identity theft in the movie 'The Net', identity is a topic of contemporary significance. Our identity is something we deal with and trade in on a daily basis, from the use of plastic cards to borrow books or hire movies, to numerical representations of that identity in PINs to the production of formal certification of our identity. For intending teachers, the importance of establishing our identity for the purpose of establishing our suitability to work with children is but one example of this focus on identity. Many everyday uses of the term 'identity' fit within the types of scenarios described in the preceding paragraphs. However, when one thinks a little more deeply about this, one comes to realize that what is really meant here is not 'identity' but 'identification' - what we produce and wear, <b>key-in</b> or display more frequently identifies us: we carry and can produce suitable identification. These things are not more than a (very small) part of our identity, and that part is usually only the legalistic, surface-level labeling of each of us as individuals. Our names, ages, perhaps addresses reflect some aspects of who we are, but these things in and of themselves are not who we are. For example, names may hint at the types of background we have (witness the difficulties faced by Australians with 'Middle Eastern-sounding' names after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 200 I). Our birthdate and age may suggest certain characteristics or features of our attitudes, clothing styles and music preferences. Our photograph may promote ideas about our racial, ethnic or cultural location. All of these are but superficial markers of an assumed identity: features or characteristics that other people take to mean that we are such-and-such. We still need to know what is meant by 'identity'. As it plays itself out across the social landscape, the question of identity at all sorts of levels presents as a very good example of what Raymond Williams termed a 'key word'(Williams, 1976), a word or phrase that both captures and directs social discourse or discussion. One thing, though, is apparent: 'identity only becomes an issue when it is in crisis, when something assumed to befIXed, coherent and stable is displaced by the experience ofdoubt and uncertainty' (Mercer, 1990, p. 43). This is perhaps a good starting point for unraveling what is meant in this text by the word 'identity'. The current era is characterized by a sufficiently large number of features such that many social theorists, including historians, consider it a particular and peculiar period in history. The most common description of this era is 'postmodernity', and while this is not a book concerned with the particular details of the postmodern period, {{it is important to understand}} something of the essential features of this time in history, primarily because they impact on this thing called 'identity'...|$|E
