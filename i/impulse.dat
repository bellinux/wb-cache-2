40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{stability}} of stochastic delay differential systems with two kinds of <b>impulses,</b> that is, destabilizing <b>impulses</b> and stabilizing <b>impulses.</b> Both the pth moment and almost sure exponential stability criteria are established by using the average impulsive interval. When the <b>impulses</b> are regarded as disturbances, a lower bound of average impulsive interval is obtained; {{it means that the}} <b>impulses</b> should not happen too frequently. On the other hand, when the <b>impulses</b> are used to stabilize the system, an upper bound of average impulsive interval is derived; namely, enough <b>impulses</b> are needed to stabilize the system. The effectiveness of the proposed results is illustrated by two examples...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Nerve <b>impulses</b> {{recorded}} from 50 /»m long pheromone sensitive olfactory sensilla in a pyralid moth {{have been}} found to consist of a single positive phase, in contrast to the usually reported biphasic pulses. The demonstration that such <b>impulses</b> are not necessarily biphasic discounts hypotheses which invoke active propagation of nerve <b>impulses</b> along the dendrite. The association of monophasic <b>impulses</b> with short sensilla and biphasic <b>impulses</b> with longer and thicker sensilla lends support to the suggestion that observed biphasic <b>impulses</b> owe their origin to passive electrical properties of the sensillum. The alternative possibility that some reported biphasic <b>impulses</b> may in fact be artefacts brought about by electrical filtering in the recording equipment of the signal is discussed...|$|R

5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a nerve <b>impulse</b> {{is carried}} down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the neuromuscular junction, where the <b>impulse</b> {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, the nerve <b>impulse</b> leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
5|$|Science Fantasy, {{which also}} {{appeared}} under the titles <b>Impulse</b> and SF <b>Impulse,</b> was a British fantasy and science fiction magazine, launched in 1950 by Nova Publications as {{a companion to}} Nova's New Worlds. Walter Gillings was editor {{for the first two}} issues, and was then replaced by John Carnell, the editor of New Worlds, as a cost-saving measure. Carnell edited both magazines until Nova went out of business in early 1964. The titles were acquired by Roberts & Vinter, who hired Kyril Bonfiglioli to edit Science Fantasy; Bonfiglioli changed the title to <b>Impulse</b> in early 1966, but the new title led to confusion with the distributors and sales fell, though the magazine remained profitable. The title was changed again to SF <b>Impulse</b> for the last few issues. Science Fantasy ceased publication the following year, when Roberts & Vinter came under financial pressure after their printer went bankrupt.|$|E

30|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{nonlinear}} differential equations subject to random <b>impulses</b> occurring at random moments. Randomness is introduced both through {{the time between}} <b>impulses,</b> which is distributed exponentially, and through the amount of <b>impulses.</b> The p-moment exponential stability of the solution is studied by employing appropriate generalized Lyapunov’s functions. In the literature many authors study the stability of impulsive systems with deterministic moments of <b>impulses</b> (see [1, 2, 4] and the references cited therein), the exponential stability of impulsive delay differential equations with deterministic moments of <b>impulses</b> [12 – 15] and the p-moment stability of stochastic differential equations with or without <b>impulses</b> [6, 7, 16, 17]. The behavior of solutions of stochastic equations is totally different from the behavior of ordinary differential equations, so the study of stability properties of differential equations with <b>impulses</b> occurring at random moments is important.|$|R

In turn, private consumption seems not to respond to fiscal <b>impulses</b> regardless of their size. The analysis confirms that expenditure based fiscal adjustments enhance wage moderation and thereby competitiveness of domestic enterprises, while expenditure-based fiscal stimuli weaken it. By contrast, we do not find evidence that fiscal <b>impulses</b> have an effect on households’ confidence. ...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: Two {{different}} regimens of SWL delivery {{for treating}} urinary stones were compared. METHODS: Patients with urinary stones were randomly {{divided into two}} groups, one of which received 3000 shocks {{at a rate of}} 60 <b>impulses</b> per minute and the other of which received 4000 shocks at 90 <b>impulses</b> per minute. Success was defined as stone-free status or the detection of residual fragments of {{less than or equal to}} 3 mm three months after treatment. Partial fragmentation was considered to have occurred if a significant reduction in the stone burden was observed but residual fragments of 3 mm or greater remained. RESULTS: A total of 143 procedures were performed with 3000 <b>impulses</b> at a rate of 60 <b>impulses</b> per minute, and 156 procedures were performed with 4000 <b>impulses</b> at 90 <b>impulses</b> per minute. The stone-free rate was 53. 1 % for patients treated with the first regimen and 54. 8 % for those treated with the second one (p = 0. 603). The stone-free rate for stones smaller than 10 mm was 60 % for patients treated with 60 <b>impulses</b> per minute and 58. 6 % for those treated with 90 <b>impulses</b> per minute. For stones bigger than 10 mm, stone-free rates were 34. 2 % and 45. 7 %, respectively (p = 0. 483). Complications occurred in 2. 3 % of patients treated with 60 <b>impulses</b> per minute and 3. 3 % of patients treated with 90 <b>impulses</b> per minute. CONCLUSION: No significant differences in the stone-free and complication rates were observed by reducing the total number of <b>impulses</b> from 4000 to 3000 and the frequency from 90 to 60 <b>impulses</b> per minute...|$|R

The inequality with finite delays in [19 – 21, 24] is extended to the inequality with infinite delays and <b>impulses</b> such that it is effective for the stochastic systems with infinite delays and <b>impulses.</b> By the new inequality, together with the stochastic analysis technique, some sufficient conditions for stability are obtained.|$|R

5|$|The {{brain is}} {{composed}} {{of a network of}} neurons that transmit signals by propagating nerve impulses. The propagation of this <b>impulse</b> from one neuron to another is typically controlled by neurotransmitters, though there are also electrical pathways between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit <b>impulse</b> firing (primarily done by γ-aminobutyric acid, or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by glutamate). A neuron that releases inhibitory neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an inhibitory neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in {{all or part of the}} brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.|$|E
