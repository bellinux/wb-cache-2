5|$|Russell T Davies {{scrapped}} a {{glass bowl}} storyline for the Partners in Crime slot in Series 4, as he decided {{this would make}} the story too contained, and that wasn't the tone he wanted. In his book The Writer's Tale, Davies remarked that he was <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> abandoned the idea, because The Simpsons Movie had a similar premise.|$|E
5|$|The first presenters of Blue Peter were Christopher Trace and Leila Williams. Trace {{presented}} for nearly nine years, and Williams for just {{over three years}} (although no footage of her has been retained by the BBC). In the early days, as the show ran continuously on a weekly basis, other presenters occasionally stepped in to give the regular team a break. Artist Tony Hart and actress Ann Taylor both presented the show either in place of either Trace or Williams, or sometimes in place of both, with Taylor replacing Williams for six weeks in 1959 and presenting the show at least once alone, as did Hart. When Williams was fired from the show in 1962 following a series of spats with a newly appointed producer, Trace continued to present the show alone or with one-off presenters until a replacement was found. The role went to Anita West, who presented sixteen editions over a four-month period in 1962—the shortest tenure of any full-time presenter—before abruptly resigning due to her imminent divorce, a reason she hid from the producers. Her tenure was so short that no footage from her time on Blue Peter exists in the BBC Archives, although footage of her audition remains, along with that of Valerie Singleton and other auditionees. It was not until 1998 that West was officially recognised as a former presenter. John Noakes is the longest-serving presenter, having presented the show for over twelve years, and Konnie Huq is the longest-serving female presenter, with a tenure of over ten years, beating Valerie Singleton by three months. However, although Singleton left the series full-time in 1972 to present the spin-off series Blue Peter Special Assignment, she continued to be an occasional presenter until 1975. Singleton's last 'official' appearance on the show came on 20 October 1975 although she was also credited with appearing on the 1975 'review of the year' programme, broadcast on 29 December 1975 Sandra Michaels presented the show twice in April 1964 {{in the absence of}} Singleton and impressed producer Edward Barnes enough that he considered replacing Singleton, but Michaels turned him down and he opted to carry on with Singleton, something he admits in hindsight he was <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> did. The youngest presenter of Blue Peter was Yvette Fielding, who was eighteen when she began presenting, and the oldest was John Noakes, who was forty-four when he left. Only one presenter, Peter Duncan, had two stints of presenting, his first being from 1980 to 1984, and his second being from 1985 to 1986.|$|E

25|$|Less popular was {{a musical}} comedy Mardi Gras (1958), {{which was the}} last movie of Edmund Goulding. However Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), a science fiction {{adventure}} tale was a huge hit.

25|$|Yuya Aoki {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} GetBackers two years before it started serialization. By that time he had few notes about it. Aoki remembers giving many troubles to his editor when he started writing it, but was <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> could finish it. The character of Ban Mido was originally meant to appear in another series from Aoki, but his editor liked it and {{wanted it to be}} one of the manga's protagonists. Ginji was meant to appear in the series, but his original personality was first meant to belong to Ban.|$|E
25|$|I congratulated Michel {{and then}} sat down. On my left was Guttierez, trying to provide a sample for the doctor, while Pollentier was in the other corner. They both had {{difficulty}} in urinating... Suddenly, the doctor cried out: 'What are you doing?' to Guttierez. I looked round and saw there was some urine in the Frenchman's test flask and a small plastic tube in his hand. He was confused and tried to say the tube {{had been in his}} pocket. I was overcome with surprise and thought 'I'm <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> isn't one of my team'. But then, about a minute later, panic returned when the doctor pulled down Pollentier's shorts and revealed this plastic tube which you all now know about.|$|E

500|$|A {{description}} {{in the book}} cover flap reads, [...] "In this tender, sensitive and blackly comic novel, Sebastian Shaw, the distinguished Shakespearean actor, explores areas of sexual and emotional encounter that are rarely seen and, unfortunately, too rarely understood." [...] Shaw originally planned to call the novel The Godfather, but later said he was <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> did not due to the popularity of Mario Puzo's book of that name. He {{was said to have}} been working on another novel shortly after The Christening was completed, but no others were ever published.|$|E

In Merioneth she received his letter of proposal on 25 July and accepted, but he died suddenly and unexpectedly on 25 August 1905 before a marriage took place. Potter became deeply depressed and was ill for many weeks. However, she rallied to complete the last two tales she had discussed with him: The Pie and the Patty-Pan and The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher.|$|E
500|$|It was {{the final}} scene of the film that made Shinkai <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> had cast Hanazawa. He knew that when Yukari cried, {{it had to be}} {{something}} impressive in order to emphasize an intense release of emotion. According to Shinkai, music alone could not produce the needed effect, and Hanazawa performed perfectly and without instruction. In an interview, he said, [...] "I believe that Ms. Hanazawa's acting on that crying scene alone completes the film." [...] This final scene, which was recorded perfectly on the first take, played a pivotal role in the casting decision for Takao's character. Though many Japanese voice actors could portray a naïve 15-year-old boy, Shinkai immediately recognized that only Miyu Irino could produce the intense emotion needed for the closing scene. Irino had also played Shun and Shin in Shinkai's Children Who Chase Lost Voices.|$|E

500|$|On the reveal, Dohring {{said in an}} interview: [...] "I’m {{actually}} glad, Rob told {{us about}} episode six or seven that we would get together. We were like, ‘No way!’ But there was something going on there. We could feel it as actors. It was damn cool – these characters {{had some kind of}} connection. So we had to start to soften {{it up a little bit}} and break the ice somewhat [...] I’m <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> gave us that heads up." [...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck. Somehow people get magic dust sprinkled on them and you don't know why. You look like you have boatloads of chemistry with someone else." [...] On the kiss itself, Dohring noted, [...] "It was so funny, as an actor, to kiss this girl. I was all nervous beforehand. But you have to just let it go for the scene. It was so fun to watch ," [...] adding that [...] "a lot of that emotion was real for me." [...] The song [...] "Momentary Thing" [...] by band Something Happens plays during Veronica and Logan's first kiss.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, mostly complimenting Davies's performance as Daniel. Chris Carabott of IGN commented {{that if this}} is the last appearance of Davies on Lost, which he [...] "somehow" [...] doubts, then, [...] "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> had the opportunity to leave on such a strong note. He delivers in some really great, emotional, moments this week – especially in the scenes in which he is suffering from memory deterioration. I've become a huge fan of Davies {{over the course of the}} last couple of years thanks to his performance on this show." [...] Rachel Dovey of Paste said the episode revealed [...] "a whole different" [...] side of Daniel: [...] "We've oscillated before about the true nature of the physicist, whether it's good or evil [...] We decided he's mostly a decent guy, barring the whole experimenting-on-his-girlfriend-then-running-away-when-her-brain-turned-to-mush thing. In the past, he's just seemed lost and confused, and, since he has those big, earnest puppy eyes, we decided to forgive him. But 'The Variable' showed us the dynamic at the heart of Daniel's stuttering vulnerability. Like all broken superheroes and Freudian beings, the man has mommy issues. This week we dove inside the dynamic between Daniel and his mother growing up." ...|$|E
500|$|Instead, Raucher {{decided to}} focus on the first major adult {{experience}} of his life, that of falling in love for the first time. The woman (named Dorothy, like her screen counterpart) was a fellow vacationer on the island whom the 14-year old Raucher had befriended one day when he helped her carry groceries home; he became a friend of her and her husband and helped her with chores after her husband was called to fight in World War II. On the night memorialized in the film, Raucher randomly came to visit her, unaware his arrival was just minutes after she received notification of her husband's death. She was confused and upset, had been drinking heavily, and repeatedly called Raucher by her husband's name. Although both ultimately [...] disrobed, contrary to popular opinion, sexual intercourse did not occur. Raucher admitted this in a 2002 interview saying it was mostly holding, but in the movie [...] "We let you think what you want." [...] The next morning, Raucher discovered that she had left the island, leaving behind a note for him (which is read {{at the end of the}} film and reproduced in the book). He never saw her again; his last [...] "encounter" [...] with her, recounted on an episode of The Mike Douglas Show, came after the film's release in 1971, when she was one of over a dozen women who wrote letters to Raucher claiming to be [...] "his" [...] Dorothy. Raucher recognized the [...] "real" [...] Dorothy's handwriting, and she confirmed her identity by making references to certain events only she could have known about. She told Raucher that she had lived for years with the guilt that she had potentially traumatized him and ruined his life. She told Raucher that she was <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> turned out all right, and that they had best not re-visit the past.|$|E

500|$|Not {{everyone}} with {{a link to}} the family supported Gordon's attempts to clear his name. Vanessa Fisher, Park's adoptive daughter, appeared as a witness for the prosecution at the trial, telling of how her father would hit the children with [...] "a stick or cane" [...] and how he would not discuss his wife's disappearance. She was not in court at the time of Park's sentencing. Ivor Price, Carol's brother, has spoken publicly at various times about his feelings about Gordon, and the Price family even sat away from Park's supporters during the trial itself. In a statement shortly after Park's guilty verdict, he said he had [...] "no doubt" [...] that justice had been done, and added that [...] "Carol was a lovely, bubbly girl who was very clever and intelligent. What has been said about her has been heartbreaking. This was about one thing: justice for Carol." [...] Around the same time, Price said that although he believed Gordon at the time of Carol's disappearance, upon the news of a body being found in Coniston Water, he [...] "knew it was her, and knew who had done it", expressing his conviction of Park's guilt. More recently, {{he said that he was}} [...] "distressed" [...] by the ongoing campaign to free Park. After Park's unsuccessful appeal, Price's daughters, Kay Washford and Claire Gardener spoke to the North-West Evening Mail, their parents having died before the appeal was rejected. Washford said [...] "It is brilliant, an amazing result. Our mum and dad Ivor and Maureen Price fought hard for this justice and now they can rest in peace because justice has been done. We are so thankful for the result and so <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> will be staying in there." [...] She added that [...] "It is finally justice for Carol." [...] The Park family and Cumbria Constabulary did not comment.|$|E
500|$|Wallace {{had once}} briefly met Darwin, {{and was one}} of the correspondents whose {{observations}} Darwin used to support his own theories. Although Wallace's first letter to Darwin has been lost, Wallace carefully kept the letters he received. In the first letter, dated 1 May 1857, Darwin commented that Wallace's letter of 10 October which he had recently received, as well as Wallace's paper [...] "On the Law which has regulated the Introduction of New Species" [...] of 1855, showed that they were both thinking alike and to some extent reaching similar conclusions, and said that he was preparing his own work for publication in about two years time. The second letter, dated 22 December 1857, said how <b>glad</b> <b>he</b> was that Wallace was theorising about distribution, adding that [...] "without speculation there is no good and original observation" [...] while commenting that [...] "I believe I go much further than you". Wallace trusted Darwin's opinion on the matter and sent him his February 1858 essay, [...] "On the Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type", with the request that Darwin would review it and pass it on to Charles Lyell if he thought it worthwhile. Although Wallace had sent several articles for journal publication during his travels through the Malay archipelago, the Ternate essay was in a private letter. On 18 June 1858, Darwin received the essay from Wallace. While Wallace's essay obviously did not employ Darwin's term [...] "natural selection", it did outline the mechanics of an evolutionary divergence of species from similar ones due to environmental pressures. In this sense, it was very similar to the theory that Darwin had worked on for twenty years, but had yet to publish. Darwin sent the manuscript to Charles Lyell with a letter saying [...] "he could not have made a better short abstract! Even his terms now stand as heads of my chapters... he does not say he wishes me to publish, but I shall, of course, at once write and offer to send to any journal."Darwin, Francis, 1887, The life and letters of Charles Darwin [...] Distraught about the illness of his baby son, Darwin put the problem to Charles Lyell and Joseph Hooker, who decided to publish the essay in a joint presentation together with unpublished writings which highlighted Darwin's priority. Wallace's essay was presented to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858, along with excerpts from an essay which Darwin had disclosed privately to Hooker in 1847 and a letter Darwin had written to Asa Gray in 1857.|$|E
