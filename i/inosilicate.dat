25|$|<b>Inosilicates</b> {{consist of}} tetrahedra {{repeatedly}} bonded in chains. These chains can be single, where a tetrahedron {{is bound to}} two others to form a continuous chain; alternatively, two chains can be merged to create double-chain silicates. Single-chain silicates have a silicon:oxygen ratio of 1:3 (e.g. 4−), whereas the double-chain variety has a ratio of 4:11, e.g. 12−. <b>Inosilicates</b> contain two important rock-forming mineral groups; single-chain silicates are most commonly pyroxenes, while double-chain silicates are often amphiboles. Higher-order chains exist (e.g. three-member, four-member, five-member chains, etc.) but they are rare.|$|R

50|$|A polyoxoanion is a {{polymeric}} oxoanion {{in which}} multiple oxoanion monomers, usually regarded as MOn polyhedra, {{are joined by}} sharing corners or edges. When two corners of a polyhedron are shared the resulting structure may be a chain or a ring. Short chains occur, for example, in polyphosphates. <b>Inosilicates,</b> such as pyroxenes, have a long chain of SiO4 tetrahedra each sharing two corners.

50|$|Tschermakite {{and all the}} {{hornblende}} {{varieties are}} <b>inosilicates,</b> and like the other rock forming amphiboles are double chain silicates (Klein and Hurlbut, 1985). The amphibole structure is characterized by its two double chains of SiO4 tetrahedra (T1 and T2) sandwiching in a strip of cations (M1, M2 and M3 octahedra). Much of the discussions and studies of both tschermakite and tremolite have been to resolve the varying cation placements and Al substitutions that seem to occur on all T and M sites (Najorka and Gottschalk, 2003).|$|R
25|$|Minerals are {{classified}} by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification. The silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses {{by the degree}} of polymerization in the chemical structure. All silicate minerals have a base unit of a 4− silica tetrahedron—that is, a silicon cation coordinated by four oxygen anions, which gives {{the shape of a}} tetrahedron. These tetrahedra can be polymerized to give the subclasses: orthosilicates (no polymerization, thus single tetrahedra), disilicates (two tetrahedra bonded together), cyclosilicates (rings of tetrahedra), <b>inosilicates</b> (chains of tetrahedra), phyllosilicates (sheets of tetrahedra), and tectosilicates (three-dimensional network of tetrahedra). Other important mineral groups include the native elements, sulfides, oxides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates.|$|R

50|$|Hornblende is {{a complex}} <b>inosilicate</b> series of {{minerals}} (ferrohornblende - magnesiohornblende). It is not a recognized mineral in its own right, but the name {{is used as a}} general or field term, to refer to a dark amphibole.|$|E
40|$|Molecular dynamic {{simulations}} of glasses {{belonging to the}} anorthite-diopside system have been performed {{in order to obtain}} an atomistic description of the material's structure.

The main differences have been observed in the intermediate-range order of the structure that describe the distribution and the packing of the tetrahedra constituting the three-dimensional networks. It is shown that the glass materials with composition close to the two extremes, corresponding to the pure glass anorthite or pure glass diopside, display the typical structural features of the tectosilicates and <b>inosilicates</b> subclass of minerals, respectively, to which anorthite and diopside crystals belong...|$|R
50|$|Minerals are {{classified}} by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification. The silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses {{by the degree}} of polymerization in the chemical structure. All silicate minerals have a base unit of a SiO44− silica tetrahedron—that is, a silicon cation coordinated by four oxygen anions, which gives {{the shape of a}} tetrahedron. These tetrahedra can be polymerized to give the subclasses: orthosilicates (no polymerization, thus single tetrahedra), disilicates (two tetrahedra bonded together), cyclosilicates (rings of tetrahedra), <b>inosilicates</b> (chains of tetrahedra), phyllosilicates (sheets of tetrahedra), and tectosilicates (three-dimensional network of tetrahedra). Other important mineral groups include the native elements, sulfides, oxides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates.|$|R
25|$|The {{degree of}} {{polymerization}} can be described by both the structure formed and how many tetrahedral corners (or coordinating oxygens) are shared (for aluminium and silicon in tetrahedral sites). Orthosilicates (or nesosilicates) have no linking of polyhedra, thus tetrahedra share no corners. Disilicates (or sorosilicates) have two tetrahedra sharing one oxygen atom. <b>Inosilicates</b> are chain silicates; single-chain silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates {{have two or three}} shared corners. In phyllosilicates, a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens; in the case of double-chain silicates, some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result. Framework silicates, or tectosilicates, have tetrahedra that share all four corners. The ring silicates, or cyclosilicates, only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure.|$|R

50|$|Rhodonite is a {{manganese}} <b>inosilicate,</b> (Mn, Fe, Mg, Ca)SiO3 {{and member}} of the pyroxenoid group of minerals, crystallizing in the triclinic system. It commonly occurs as cleavable to compact masses with a rose-red color (the name comes from the Greek ῥόδος rhodos, rosy), often tending to brown because of surface oxidation.|$|E
40|$|A novel cubic bicontinuous {{morphology}} {{is found}} in polymer-ceramic nanocomposites and mesoporous alum <b>inosilicates</b> that are derived by an amphiphilic diblock copolymer, poly(isoprene-b-ethylene oxide) (PI-b-PEO), used as a structure-directing agent for an inorganic aluminosilicate. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) was employed to unambiguously identify the Im 3 m crystallographic symmetry of the materials by fitting individual Bragg peak positions in the two-dimensional X-ray images. Structure factor calculations, in conjunction with results from transmission electron microscopy, were used to narrow the range of possible structures consistent with the symmetry and showed the plumber's nightmare morphology {{to be consistent with}} the data. The samples are made by deposition onto a substrate that imposes a strain field, generating a lattice distortion. This distortion is quantitatively analyzed and shown to have resulted in shrinkage of the crystallites by approximately one-third in a direction perpendicular to the substrate, in both as-made composites and calcined ceramic materials. Finally, the observation of the bicontinuous block-copolymer-derived hybrid morphology is discussed {{in the context of a}} pseudo-ternary morphology diagram and compared to existing studies of ternary phase diagrams of amphiphiles in a mixture of two solvents. The calcined mesoporous materials have potential applications in the fields of catalysis, separation technology, and microelectronics...|$|R
40|$|Phase {{transitions}} between pseudowollastonite, wollastonite I, and wollastonite II {{have been}} reversed in piston-cylinder apparatus, and the melting curve for these CaSiO, polymorphs {{has been determined}} between 10 and 35 kbars. The pseudowollastonite melting curve rises from 1544 °C at 1 bar with an unusually steep slope (dP/dT = 580 bar/°C) to a triple point at 1588 °C and 23 kbar, where the solidus meets the transition from pseudowollastonite to wollastonite I, rising from 1125 °C at 1 bar. The transition boundary between wollastonite I and wollastonite II has a shallow, negative slope (dP/dT = - 8. 4 bar/ °C); the triple point where it reaches the solidus is at 1598 °C and 27. 5 kbar. The slope of the fusion curve decreases at each triple point, and dP/dT for wollastonite II, 192 bar/°C, is much closer {{to that of other}} silicates, such as diopside, enstatite, and albite, than to wollastonite I. Refractive indices of glasses quenched from high pressure CaSiO, and CaMgSi_ 2 O_ 8 liquids vary less as a function of pressure than do indices of glasses quenched from feldspars and feldspathic liquids. Either the densities of liquids of <b>inosilicates</b> are changed less than those of tektosilicates by pressure, or their high pressure densities are not quenched into the glasses...|$|R
40|$|From a mineralogical {{survey of}} {{approximately}} 30 chondritic micrometeorites {{collected from the}} lower stratosphere and studied in detail using current electron microscopy techniques, it is concluded that these particles represent a unique group of extraterrestrial materials. These micrometeorites differ significantly in form and texture from components of carbonaceous chondrites and contain some mineral assemblages which do not occur in any meteorite class. Electron microscope investigations of chondritic micrometeorites have established that these materials (1) are extraterrestrial in origin, (2) existed in space as small objects, (3) endured minimal alteration by planetary processes since formation, and (4) can suffer minimal pulse heating (< 600 °C) on entering earth's atmosphere. The probable sources for chondritic interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) are cometary and asteroidal debris and, perhaps to a lesser extent, interstellar regions. These sources have not been conclusively linked to any specific mineralogical subset of IDP, although the chondritic porous (CP) aggregate is considered of likely cometary origin. Chondritic IDPs occur in two predominant mineral assemblages: (1) carbonaceous phases and phyllosilicates and (2) carbonaceous phases and nesosilicates or <b>inosilicates,</b> although particles with both types of silicate assemblages are observed. Olivines, pyroxenes, layer silicates, and carbon-rich phases are the most commonly occurring minerals in many chondritic IDPs. Other phases often observed in variable proportions include sulphides, spinels, metals, metal carbides, carbonates, and minor amounts of sulphates and phosphates. Individual mineral grain sizes range from micrometers (primarily pyroxenes and olivines) to nanometers, with the predominant size for all phases less than 100 nm. Specific mineral characteristics for particular chondritic IDPs provide an indication of processes which may have occurred prior to collection in the earth's stratosphere. For example, pyroxene mineralogy in some chondritic aggregates is consistent with condensation from a vapor phase and, we consider, with condensation in a turbulent solar nebula at relatively low temperatures (< 1000 °C). Carbonaceous phases present in other CP aggregates {{have been used to}} imply low-temperature formation processes such as Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (∼ 530 °C) or carbonization and graphitization (∼ 315 °C). Alteration processes have been implicated in the formation of some layer silicates in CP aggregates and may have involved hydrocryogenic alteration at < 0 °C. In general, interpretations of transformation processes on submicrometer-size minerals in chondritic IDPs are consistent with formation at a radius equivalent to the asteroid belt or greater during the later stages of solar nebula evolution using currently available models...|$|R
