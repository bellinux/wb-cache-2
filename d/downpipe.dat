25|$|The wide stairs {{leading from}} the subway land in the {{southern}} third of the building at a ticket hall and waiting area, which is open on both sides. A painted steel mid-rail runs the length of these stairs. Opposite the stair void the gaps between the piers are filled with screens made with a metal frame and grill panel bolted to the brick surrounds and resting on low brick walls. The internal faces of the piers are rendered and painted. The ticket windows are directly opposite the stair landing. Only the western one is currently in use, the other now hidden behind a freestanding automatic ticket machine. A number of timetable wall-boxes line the available wall space, one being an early timber example. One of the original chrome-plated ticket rails {{in front of the}} operating ticket window remains. The floor is lined with a chequered pattern of black and white terrazzo tiles, while the ceiling is made with fibrous cement sheeting. A stainless steel <b>downpipe</b> marks {{the top of the stairs}} and the endpoint of the middle handrail. There were four downpipes in the original design, one next to what had been the telephone box on the south-eastern facade, another between the office and store and another between the toilet and waiting area. How many still exist is unknown as three were enclosed in various walls along the centreline of the building and cannot be viewed. It is likely that some if not all remain.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Ferrara {{proposed}} {{a new project}} to build 76 units and homes in seven stages; these stages would have spanned three to four years. Ferrara undertook {{a joint venture with}} Peter Madew, who was to assist with funding and the management needed for the construction. They also proposed restoration efforts to the orphanage, which included painting, repairing holes in walls, and replacing windows. They also planned to restore the front garden, commence general landscaping, construct a recreation area, and build a number of units in the orphanage itself; an indoor swimming pool was proposed for construction in the courtyard. However, Madew claimed that restoration of the orphanage would [...] "cost millions". Ferrara later announced that he would not go ahead with the redevelopment, but instead lodge a new plan: this plan would foresee the construction of 18 new dwellings on the lot. This was objected to by the council should the building remain in its current deteriorating state. Ferrara responded by stating he would commit funds from his profits towards the building's restoration, at a cost of least $1.5 million. In late 2013, Ferrara {{proposed a}}nother development on the lot which would see the construction of 15 residential units. However, the Goulburn Mulwaree Council has demanded that Ferrara must schedule repairs to the orphanage before any approval can be granted. In response, Ferarra pledged to spend $250,000 on restoration works, covering <b>downpipe,</b> guttering, and roof repairs, as well as window replacements and external painting.|$|E
2500|$|Buxhall Mill had a domed {{cap with}} a gallery. It was [...] {{diameter}} and [...] high internally. The four Patent sails [...] had eleven bays of three shutters, and spanned [...] They were carried on stocks of [...] long, [...] square at the poll end. The sails were [...] long and [...] long. They were fitted with Catchpole's Air Brakes. These provided extra power in light winds, but acted {{as an effective}} air brake in strong winds. The windshaft weighed 38 cwt (1,930kg) and cost £38. 0. 0. new in 1860. The cap was winded by an eight bladed fantail. An unusual feature of this mill was the cast iron gutter around the curb, which collected rainwater from the cap and delivered {{it to the ground}} via a <b>downpipe</b> {{on the outside of the}} mill.|$|E
25|$|Architects often look to {{architectural}} copper for {{continuity in}} design elements. For example, a copper roofing {{system may be}} designed with copper flashings, weatherings, vents, gutters, and <b>downpipes.</b> Cover details may include cornices, moldings, finials and sculptures.|$|R

50|$|Green {{tree frogs}} are little {{troubled by the}} {{presence}} of man and often live in close association with humans. They sometimes stray inside houses and are found in such places as sinks and toilets. They can also be found on outside windowsills at night, eating insects attracted to the light, and they may gather under outdoor lighting for the same reason. They sometimes occupy tanks (cisterns), <b>downpipes</b> (downspouts), and gutters, as these have high humidity and are usually cooler than the external environment. They may be drawn to the <b>downpipes</b> and tanks during the mating season because the fixtures amplify their calls. Green tree frogs seem to have homing abilities, being able to return to locations from which they were caught from a considerable distance after being displaced.|$|R
50|$|A downspout, waterspout, <b>downpipe,</b> drain spout, {{roof drain}} pipe, leader, or rone (Scotland) is a pipe for {{carrying}} rainwater from a rain gutter.|$|E

50|$|Savery's engine had no piston, and no {{moving parts}} except from the taps. It was {{operated}} by first raising steam in the boiler; the steam was then admitted {{to one of}} the first working vessels, allowing it to blow out through a <b>downpipe</b> into the water that was to be raised. When the system was hot and therefore full of steam the tap between the boiler and the working vessel was shut, and if necessary the outside of the vessel was cooled. This made the steam inside it condense, creating a partial vacuum, and atmospheric pressure pushed water up the <b>downpipe</b> until the vessel was full. At this point the tap below the vessel was closed, and the tap between it and the up-pipe opened, and more steam was admitted from the boiler. As the steam pressure built up, it forced the water from the vessel up the up-pipe {{to the top of the}} mine.|$|E
5|$|Wastewater {{networks}} may sustain damage {{similar to}} water supply networks. It {{is very difficult}} to exclude ash from the sewerage system. Systems with combined storm water/sewer lines are most at risk. Ash will enter sewer lines where there is inflow/infiltration by stormwater through illegal connections (e.g., from roof <b>downpipes),</b> cross connections, around manhole covers or through holes and cracks in sewer pipes.|$|R
50|$|The Barker Street facade was {{blank and}} painted in two tone olive green paint, {{in line with}} the upward slope of the street.

50|$|The railway {{platform}} has tall sash windows, {{some of which}} have been painted out, and timber panelled doors with fanlights open from the adjoining offices and service rooms. Rainwater heads, draining the box gutter between the station building and the carriage shade, protrude into the platform area, with the <b>downpipe</b> inset into the station building wall. The signal box protrudes from the station building on a raised concrete base, and has sliding multi-paned windows to three sides.|$|E
50|$|It {{is easy to}} install, economical, {{lightweight}} requires minimum {{maintenance and}} has a life expectancy of 50 years. The material has a disadvantageous {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} 0.06 mm/m°C, so design allowances have to be made. A 4-metre gutter, enduring a −5 °C to 25 °C temperature range will need space to expand, 30 × 4 × 0.06 = 7.2 mm within its end stops. As a rule of thumb a 4 in gutter with a single 68 mm <b>downpipe</b> will drain a 600 sq ft roof.|$|E
5000|$|Thermal barrier ceramic {{coatings}} {{are becoming}} more common in automotive applications. They are specifically designed to reduce heat loss from engine exhaust system components including exhaust manifolds, turbocharger casings, exhaust headers, <b>downpipes</b> and tailpipes. This process {{is also known as}} [...] "exhaust heat management". When used under-bonnet, these have the positive effect of reducing engine bay temperatures, therefore reducing the intake air temperature.|$|R

50|$|Water {{collected}} by a rain gutter is fed, usually via a <b>downpipe</b> (also called a leader or conductor), {{from the roof}} edge {{to the base of}} the building where it is either discharged or collected. The down pipe can terminate in a shoe and discharge directly onto the surface, but using modern construction techniques would be connected through an inspection chamber to a drain that led to a surface water drain or soakaway. Alternatively it would connect via a gulley (u-bend) with 50mm water seal to a combined drain. Water from rain gutters may be harvested in a rain barrel or a cistern.|$|E
