5000|$|Built from April 1965 to July 1966. The Phase III {{units were}} the most {{numerous}} and included the Upgraded U25Cs. A total of 78 U25Cs were built with this carbody. The Phase III U25C carbody overlapped into early Phase I U28C production. A total of 28 Phase I U28Cs used this same carbody. The Phase III had screened panel openings in the carbody behind the cab. Louvers were eliminated {{from the left side}} of the carbody, but kept on the engineer’s side. A rectangular box opening on the roof provided fresh air for ventilation and cooling the air tanks. Pennsylvania and L&N U25Cs also had an extra equipment box and third <b>handrail</b> <b>stanchion</b> on the raised part of the walkway next to the radiator intake. The extra equipment box was for extended range dynamic brake contactors. In later Phase III production screened doors replaced the screen panels behind the engineer’s side of the cab. The louvers behind the engineer’s side of the cab were also removed in late production Phase III units.|$|E
50|$|The GP40 is 3 ft {{longer than}} its EMD 567D3A-engined predecessor, the GP35, and {{distinguished}} visually by its three 48-inch radiator fans {{at the rear}} of the long hood, while the GP35 has two large fans and a smaller one in between. It was built on a 55 ft frame; the GP35 was built on a 52 ft frame - as was the GP7, 9, 18, and 30. The difference in length can be seen in the GP40's ten <b>handrail</b> <b>stanchions</b> compared to the GP35's nine.|$|R
500|$|In 1937, {{the light}} was {{converted}} to 110V DC electricity. The two distinctive red bands were painted in 1942. In 1967 the power source was replaced with 240V AC power, being supplied by two diesel alternators, and a new lens, pedestal, bearing and optic drive may have been installed. The range of the 1967 light was [...] The light was modernised in July 1988, with the installation of a 120V 1Kw tungsten halogen lamp. In 1990, the <b>handrails</b> and <b>stanchions</b> of the balcony and external staircase were replaced and an access ladder to the dome was installed. On 8 December 1993, {{the light was}} converted to solar powered operation and a VRB-25 apparatus was installed.|$|R

This study aimed to detect biological forms of intestinal parasites in samples from public buses in the town of Diamantina, Minas Gerais, in order to know the local situation and propose interventions to improve public health. Materials and methods: In November 2014, six samples were obtained in buses of the two stations by using Graham method, in duplicate, by affixing a 6 × 5 cm clear tape, six times on each collection site of the bus, in an area of ~ 30 cm 2. Then, each tape was positioned longitudinally on a slide microscope, and the identification of the biological forms of the parasites was performed {{with the aid of a}} 40 × objective optical microscope. Results: A total of 216 slides were analyzed, of which 86 (39. 8 %) were positive for at least one intestinal parasite. Cysts of Entamoeba coli were the most frequently found in this study (52. 1 %), followed by Endolimax nana cysts (30. 7 %), Iodamoeba butschlii (6. 5 %), helminth larvae (4. 7 %), Giardia lamblia cysts (3. 6 %), Hymenolepis nana eggs (1. 2 %), Enterobius vermicularis eggs (0. 6 %), and Entamoeba histolytica cysts (0. 6 %). Top right <b>handrails</b> and right <b>stanchions</b> had the highest occurrence of biological forms, with 18. 3 % and 14. 8 %, respectively. Conclusion: The results indicated the need for better cleaning of the buses and better personal hygiene by users, since pathogenic and non-pathogenic intestinal parasites were found, suggesting fecal contamination of these sites, representing a risk to public health.
