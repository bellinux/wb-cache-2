5|$|In early 2009, Torres began a scripted {{feud with}} Michelle McCool after McCool {{attacked}} her. On the February 6 episode of SmackDown, Eve made her singles match debut in a losing effort against McCool via submission. Their feud continued {{for the next}} few months, with the two competing against each other in singles and tag team matches. In mid-2009, Eve started competing in dance and arm wrestling competitions against Layla, later defeating her on the May 29 episode of SmackDown in a singles match. On the June 18 episode of Superstars, Eve pinned Layla once again. After the match, they both shook <b>hands.</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> same as her scripted rivalry with Layla, Eve became associated with Cryme Tyme (Shad and JTG), where Torres accompanied them to the ring as their manager. Eve and Cryme Tyme then participated in multiple six-person mixed tag team matches against The Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith, Tyson Kidd, and Natalya), with Eve also facing Natalya in singles and tag team matches involving other Divas. Her final match on SmackDown was on October 9, when she was defeated in a singles match by McCool.|$|E
5|$|Mummification was a {{tradition}} that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, the habit of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD. The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved {{members of the society}} by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry the body and the phenol conserve the organs and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours. After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, or in some cases placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the Sun Temple. The position of the mummies was with their arms folded across the chest and the <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. The habit of mummification continued well into the colonial period; the youngest mummies found date from {{the second half of the}} 18th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{performance}} finally improved but {{the result}} stayed the same when Middlesbrough went to Old Trafford, where Matthew Bates started a Middlesbrough game {{for the first time}} since the end of the 2005–06 season. Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson had spoken before the game, hoping to banish the rift that existed between the two clubs. Things probably weren't helped when Pogatetz, defending a corner, put his <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> back of Cristiano Ronaldo's neck a corner and the United player went down, claiming a penalty. The spat continued when the players walked off the pitch for half time. Dimitar Berbatov's goal was the decisive moment in the game when he fired home to give his side a 1–0 victory, and left Middlesbrough hovering above the relegation zone on goal difference and without a win in eight games.|$|E
25|$|On the January 19 {{episode of}} Raw, Ambrose {{defeated}} Intercontinental Champion Bad News Barrett in a non-title match. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, Ambrose {{participated in the}} Royal Rumble match, but was eliminated by Big Show and Kane. The following weeks, Ambrose demanded a match for Barrett's title which Barrett declined, leading to Ambrose attacking him, tying his <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ring post and forcing him to sign a contract for a title match at Fastlane on February 22, where Ambrose lost the subsequent match by disqualification, but stole the championship belt afterward. At WrestleMania 31 on March 29, Ambrose participated in a seven-man ladder match for the championship, but lost after Luke Harper performed a powerbomb on him through a ladder and knocked {{him out of the}} match as result. After further attacks between the two, Ambrose defeated Harper at Extreme Rules on April 26, his first singles victory on a pay-per-view event since The Shield split up.|$|E
25|$|On August 29, 2007, a {{chain link}} fence was {{constructed}} around the protesters. The fence was erected to prevent {{confrontation between the}} protesters and the sellout crowd of 72,516 people (17,000 of them from Tennessee, the opposing team) that were expected to attend the opening game of the California Golden Bears' football season. Protesters responded with shouts and promises to {{make it difficult for}} the UCPD to guard the fence. The protesters claimed the fence was erected not to protect them, but to starve them out. Some have drawn comparisons between the building of the fence, and the attempted take back of People's Park in 1969, in which the California National Guard was called in to remove protesters. Initially the police did not allow food and water to be passed over the fence to the tree sitters, but started to allow the deliveries by the evening. Two men were arrested following scuffles with police. Around 200 additional people joined <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> fence in support of the tree sitters. The fence cost the University between $10,000 and $12,000 to build. Despite the fence more protesters took up spots in the trees.|$|E

500|$|Walker is {{best remembered}} {{for a pair}} of one-handed catches he made in 2001. [...] Prior to the 2002 NFL Draft, Baltimore Ravens Senior vice {{president}} of football operations, Ozzie Newsome referred to Walker's collegiate catches as some of the best catches he has seen in college in a long time. [...] One of the one-handed catches was a touchdown catch {{in the back of the}} end zone against the Iowa Hawkeyes football team in a 32–26 comeback from a 21–7 deficit on October 27, 2001. [...] The Post-Standard, Walker's hometown newspaper, described his grab in the Iowa game this way: [...] "There he was in the corner of the end zone, as two Iowa defensive backs stalked him like [...] [...] The ball, delivered high and wide, seemed an improbable stretch, an impossible goal. [...] And yet, as it spiraled toward him, Marquise Walker leaped and lifted his right arm. [...] His fingertips grazed the leather and tipped it skyward. [...] And then, as he tumbled back to earth, he wrapped his <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ball and caressed it to his chest. [...] Touchdown Michigan." ...|$|E

2500|$|Defending {{against the}} person who has the disc is a central part of the {{defensive}} strategy (colloquially [...] "marking"). The defensive [...] "marker" [...] counts aloud to 10 seconds, which is referred to as [...] "stalling". If the disc has not been thrown when the defending player reaches 10, it is turned over to the other team. [...] "Stall" [...] can be only be called after the defender has actually counted the 10 seconds [...] There can only be one player defending in a 3-meter radius around {{the person who}} has the disk unless that player is defending against another offensive player. The marker must stay one disc's diameter away from the thrower and must not wrap their <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> thrower, or the person with the disk can call a foul ("wrapping").|$|E

2500|$|The clinch – Clinching {{is a form}} of {{trapping}} or a rough form of grappling and {{occurs when}} the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed. In this situation, the boxer attempts to hold or [...] "tie up" [...] the opponent's hands so he is unable to throw hooks or uppercuts. To perform a clinch, the boxer loops both <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> outside of the opponent's shoulders, scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent's arms tightly against his own body. In this position, the opponent's arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack. Clinching is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee. Clinching is technically against the rules, and in amateur fights points are deducted fairly quickly for it. It is unlikely, however, to see points deducted for a clinch in professional boxing.|$|E
60|$|As it was, unfortunately, Pierre's arm glanced {{across the}} back of Uncle 'Rasmus's chair, and the blow was robbed of half its force. It was sufficient, however, to {{partially}} daze Abel Hunt, and before he could recover either his senses or his footing Morgan was upon him like a wild-cat, clutching both <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> fellow's throat to prevent any outcry, while the two came down upon the puncheon planks with a thud that shook the building.|$|E
60|$|Hurry first {{attempted}} to throw his antagonist. With this view he seized {{him by the}} throat, and an arm, and tripped with the quickness and force of an American borderer. The effect was frustrated by the agile movements of the Huron, who had clothes to grasp by, and whose feet avoided the attempt with a nimbleness equal to that with which it was made. Then followed a sort of melee, if such a term {{can be applied to}} a struggle between two in which no efforts were strictly visible, the limbs and bodies of the combatants assuming so many attitudes and contortions as to defeat observation. This confused but fierce rally lasted less than a minute, however; when, Hurry, furious at having his strength baffled by the agility and nakedness of his foe, made a desperate effort, which sent the Huron from him, hurling his body violently against the logs of the hut. The concussion was so great as momentarily to confuse the latter's faculties. The pain, too, extorted a deep groan; an unusual concession to agony to escape a red man in the heat of battle. Still he rushed forward again to meet his enemy, conscious that his safety rested on it's resolution. Hurry now seized the other by the waist, raised him bodily from the platform, and fell with his own great weight on the form beneath. This additional shock so stunned the sufferer, that his gigantic white opponent now had him completely at his mercy. Passing his <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> throat of his victim, he compressed them with the strength of a vice, fairly doubling the head of the Huron {{over the edge of the}} platform, until the chin was uppermost, with the infernal strength he expended. An instant sufficed to show the consequences. The eyes of the sufferer seemed to start forward, his tongue protruded, and his nostrils dilated nearly to splitting. At this instant a rope of bark, having an eye, was passed dexterously within the two arms of Hurry, the end threaded the eye, forming a noose, and his elbows were drawn together behind his back, with a power that all his gigantic strength could not resist. Reluctantly, even under such circumstances, did the exasperated borderer see his hands drawn from their deadly grasp, for all the evil passions were then in the ascendant. Almost at the same instant a similar fastening secured his ankles, and his body was rolled to the centre of the platform as helplessly, and as cavalierly, as if it were a log of wood. His rescued antagonist, however, did not rise, for while he began again to breathe, his head still hung helplessly over the edge of the logs, and it was thought at first that his neck was dislocated. He recovered gradually only, and it was hours before he could walk. Some fancied that neither his body, nor his mind, ever totally recovered from this near approach to death.|$|E
