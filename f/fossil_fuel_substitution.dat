40|$|Short {{rotation}} bioenergy crops {{for energy}} production are considered {{an effective means}} to mitigate the greenhouse effect, mainly due {{to their ability to}} substitute fossil fuels. Alternatively, carbon can be sequestered and stored in the living biomass. This paper compares the two land use categories (forest land and non-forest land) for two management practices (short rotation vs. long rotation) to study mitigation potential of afforestation and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution</b> as compared to carbon storage. Significant carbon benefit can be obtained in the long run from using lands for growing short rotation energy crops and substituting fossil fuels by the biomass thus produced, as opposed to sequestering carbon in the biomass of the trees. When growth rates are high and harvest is used in a sustainable manner (i. e., replanting after every harvest), the opportunities for net carbon reductions appear to be <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution,</b> rather than storage in ecosystem biomass. Our results suggest that at year 100 a total of 216 Mg C ha- 1 is sequestered for afforestation/reforestation using long rotation sal (Shorea robusta Gaertn. f) species, as opposed to offset of 412 Mg C ha- 1 for carbon storage and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution</b> for short rotation poplar (Populus Deltoides Marsh) plantations. The bioenergy option results in a continuous stream of about 3 Mg C ha- 1 yr- 1 of carbon benefits per year on forest land and 4 Mg C ha- 1 yr- 1 on non-forest land. Earlier studies have shown that in India waste land availability for establishing energy plantations is in the range of 9. 6 to 36. 5 Mha. Thus, using the 758 Tg biomass per year generated from 9. 6 Mha waste land gives a mitigation potential in the range of 227 to 303 Tg C per year for carbon storage and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution</b> from poplar plantation for substituting coal based power generation. Depending upon the land availability for plantation, the potential for energy generation is in the range of 11, 370 PJ, possibly amounting to a bioenergy supply of 43 % of the total projected energy consumption in 2015. Further studies are needed to estimate the mitigation potential of other species with different productivities for overall estimation of the economic feasibility and social acceptability in a tropical country like Indi...|$|E
40|$|Climate change {{mitigation}} {{and security}} of energy supply are important targets of Austrian energy policy. Bioenergy production based on resources from agriculture and forestry is an important option for attaining these targets. To increase the share of bioenergy in the energy supply, supporting policy instruments are necessary. The cost-effectiveness of these instruments in attaining policy targets depends on the availability of bioenergy technologies. Advanced technologies such as second generation biofuels, biomass gasification for power production, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) will likely change the performance of policy instruments. This article assesses the cost-effectiveness of energy policy instruments, considering new bioenergy technologies for the year 2030, with respect to greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution.</b> Instruments that directly subsidize bioenergy are compared with instruments that aim at reducing GHG emissions. A spatially explicit modeling approach is used to account for biomass supply and energy distribution costs in Austria.

40|$|In {{transition}} {{towards a}} {{sustainable energy system}} with deep reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reduced consumption of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels,</b> <b>substitution</b> of <b>fossil</b> energy carriers with biomass {{is considered one of}} the most important options. In the last decade, fossil energy and GHG mitigation policies and volatile <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> prices have driven rapid growth of modern biomass. In contrast to local, traditional biomass uses for heating and cooking in developing countries, modern biomass uses are often geographically remote from the locations that have the larger economic biomass supply potentials. This has already resulted in rapid growth of trade of solid and liquid biomass sources, especially in the European Union (EU) and will likely continue to grow in the future. The prospective growth of bioenergy and geography of trade are still highly uncertain. This thesis aims to bridge some of the knowledge gaps on the deployment of bioenergy at the national and European level by means of system analysis. A key focus of this thesis are the high variabilities of cost and GHG balances of bioenergy systems, which can both be caused by methodological choices, the locations of feedstock production, logistics, the conversion system and rate of technological learning. Bottom-up spreadsheet tools have been developed to compare the variability in energy and GHG balance of different biofuel production systems with variations in key assumptions and methods to account for co-products (Chapter 2). In Chapter 3, a bottom-up accounting tool is used in combination with the computable general equilibrium model LEITAP to assess future scenarios of avoided fossil energy and GHG emissions next to direct and indirect economic effects of bioenergy deployment for the Netherlands to 2030. Spatially explicit approaches are developed to account for the geographic implications of feedstock supply, logistics and demand. For the Southeast of the U. S., a key exporting regions of wood pellets, the potential of alternative, low-value wood fiber sources has been assessed taking into account the dispersed supply of wood fiber resources and locations of pellet production plants (Chapter 4). For long distance international transport of biomass, this thesis describes the development of the BIT-UU model that can be used to calculate the cost and GHG emissions of international biomass transportation taking into account the available infrastructure (road, rail, inland waterways, sea). This model is linked to the European renewable energy model Green-X model in Chapter 5 to assess the future role of domestic use and trade of biomass in context of renewable energy policies in the EU. Furthermore, the BIT-UU model is linked to the U. S. based Biomass Logistic Model (BLM) to assess the cost and GHG emissions of intercontinental lignocellulosic feedstock supply chains between the U. S. and Europe in Chapter 6. The developed methods, tools and linkages to (established) modeling frameworks provide insights into the role of domestic and internationally traded biomass in fulfilling national and European renewable energy targets, economic effects, GHG mitigation and consequences of methodological choices and input assumptions to the life-cycle GHG performance and energy balance...|$|R

40|$|Preparation for <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution</b> in the {{building}} sector persists as an essential subject in architectural engineering. Since {{the building}} sector still remains {{as one of the}} three major global end energy consumer â climate change is closely related to construction and design. We have developed the archetype sun space to what it is today : a simple but effective predominant naturally ventilated sun trap and as well as living space enlargement. With the invention of industrial glass orangeryâs more and more changed from frost protecting envelopes to living spaces from which we meantime expect thermal comfort in high quality. But what level of thermal comfort provide sun spaces? And to what extend may sun spaces manage autarkic operation profiting from passive solar gains and, beyond that, surplus energy generation for energy neutral conditioning of aligned spaces? We deliver detailed information for this detected gap of knowledge. We know about limited thermal comfort in sun spaces winter times. This reasons the inspection of manifold collector technologies, which enable to be embedded in facades and specifically in sun space envelopes. Nonetheless, effective faÃ§ade integrated collectors are ineffective in seasons with poor irradiation. Hence, the mismatch of offer and demand we have experienced with renewable energies ignites thinking about appropriate seasonal energy storages, which enlarges the research scope of this work. This PhD thesis project investigates on both, a yearly empirical test set up analysis and a virtual simulation of different oriented and located sun spaces abroad Germany. Both empirical and theoretical evaluation result in a holistic research focusing on a preferred occupation time in terms of cumulative frequencies of operational temperature and decided local discomfort, of potential autarkic sun space operation and prospective surplus exergy for alternative heating of aligned buildings. The results are mapped geographically for Germany. <b>Fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution,</b> as far as this thesis elaborated, is closely related to quality of thermal comfort, sun space orientation and energetic standard of the aligned building. Unexpectedly, spaces, which define envelopes incorporating collectors in combination with storage technologies both profit and suffer to some extend in respect to thermal comfort. Essentially, we can conclude, that the more area-wise efficient and the more integral the collector technology is incorporated into faÃ§ade design, the more distinct significance of thermal comfort quality and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution</b> is.

The <b>substitution</b> of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> with biofuels can be a useful tool to fulfil the Spanish and European policy in relation to mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increase the security in energy supply. The continuous increase in energy consumption, dependence on energy and high petroleum prices has motivated increasing support for renewable energy promotion. In Spain (the third ethanol producer in Europe in 2007), ethanol from lignocellulosic feedstocks {{could be one of}} the most valuable and interesting possibilities for renewable transportation fuels due to the limited competition with food production and high net reduction of GHG emissions. This study is focused on flax shives, obtained as an agricultural co-product from flax crops dedicated to fibre production for specialty paper pulp manufacture as lignocellulosic biomass to produce second generation ethanol involving the use of cellulosic technology. The life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used to evaluate the environmental impacts of the production and use in a flexi fuel vehicle (FFV) of ethanol blends (10 and 85 % in volume of ethanol with gasoline) versus conventional gasoline, throughout their whole life cycle in order to highlight the main sources of these impacts. The system boundaries include cultivation, extraction, processing and final use of fuels. Mass and economic allocation were considered to determine the effect on the results of different allocation approaches. The results of the study show that the allocation methods are essential for outcomes and decision-making. Using ethanol as transportation fuel could present better environmental performance than conventional gasoline in terms of global warming and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption according to mass allocation. However, environmental credits could be achieved in terms of acidification, <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> consumption and human toxicity according to economic allocation. Contributions to other impact categories such as eutrophication and photochemical oxidants formation were lower for conventional gasoline regardless of the allocation procedure selected.

40|$|There is a {{gap between}} the {{increased}} scientific understanding of carbon pools and fluxes at individual trees/stand and that of forested landscape with complex structures (i. e. variety of species, age classes, site characteristic and management practices). The question about how results generated from a simulated physiologically distinct individual(s) /stands grown at a particular location (scale) can be extrapolated (scaling) across a diverse population in time and space with diverse environments, has been troubling scientists for many years. Scale and scaling present three problems in common: (a) spatial heterogeneity, (b) non-linearity in response and (c) disturbance regimes. Scale, in particular, presents other three problems: (d) threshold scale for processes, (e) dominant processes with scales and (f) emerging properties of the system. Scaling presents problems with (g) feedbacks between plants and environment and (h) plant interactions. The present study proposes a modeling framework linking a process-based model SECRETS - to overcome some of the scale and scaling problems (a, b, c, d and g) - to a C accounting model GORCAM - to integrate the effects of C stock in wood products and from <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution.</b> The capabilities of the modeling framework are tested against three theoretical complex forested landscapes that combine some of the five following scenarios: existing multifunctional forest under (1) actual and (2) changing environmental conditions, and afforestation of an agricultural area with (3) a new multifunctional forest or with (4) a short rotation coppice (poplar) or with (5) an agricultural crop (miscanthus) for bioenergy production. Forest reserves calculations are included for completeness of the landscape C balance and as reference.

However, comparison of results under changing environmental conditions, against specific plant literature suggest SECRETS formulation must be improved with recent development in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and N balances.

This requires not only a comprehensive suite of policies and measures but emphasis on the development path and ânon-technicalâ change for optimal outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The Bulgarian {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emission profile reveals {{the energy sector}} as the most significant emission source and also as an area where great potential for GHG emissions reduction exists. Mitigation options in energy supply were selected considering the potential of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution</b> and new energy technology implementation {{in the context of}} the existing structure of energy system and projects for mid- and long-term development. Basically three modules of ENPEP were used: BALANCE [...] to calculate the energy flows and energy cost from primary fuel resources and fuel import to energy end-use, IMPACT [...] to calculate GHG emissions, and ELECTRIC [...] to project the electric system long-term development. Different mitigation measures combined in four scenarios were developed. The integrated mitigation scenario incorporated a mix of mitigation measures in the energy demand and supply. Implementation of CO 2 mitigation measures both in energy demand and energy supply would reduce the 2020 emission level by 34. 3 Tg (29. 1 %), and by 544. 2 Tg (21. 7 %) for the entire study period 2000 - 2020, compared to the baseline scenario. ...|$|E

The country suffers from frequent power outages, and inconvenient blackâouts while residents and industries are forced to depend on self-generated electricity. Life-cycle assessment methodology {{was used to assess}} the environmental burdens associated with self-generated electricity (SGE) and proposed embedded power generation in Nigeria. The study shows that SGE from 5 kVA diesel generators contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 1625 kg CO 2 eq. /MWh, along with other environmental burdens. Based on a point estimate of diesel electric generators in Nigeria, SGE can contribute 389 million tonnes CO 2 eq. to climate change every year. This can reposition Nigeria {{as one of the top}} 20 emitters of CO 2 globally. A mandatory diesel fuel displacement with Jatropha biodiesel can reduce annual GHG emissions from SGE by 76 % provided combined cycle power plants are adopted for embedded power generation. The magnitude of these benefits would depend on material inputs, seed yield as well as the environmental status of the reference fuel. Minimal use of fertilizers, chemicals and resources and <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>substitution</b> with renewable options can minimize adverse environmental burdens...|$|E
40|$|Ecosystems {{services}} {{include the}} collection, concentration, and storage of solar energy as <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> (e. g., coal, petroleum, and natural gas). These concentrated {{forms of energy}} were produced by ancient ecosystem services. However, our legal and economic systems fail to recognise {{the value of the}} ecosystem service subsidies embedded in <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> This ecosystem services price subsidy causes overuse and waste of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> in the free market: <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> are consumed more quickly than they can be replaced by ecosystem services and in far larger quantities than they would be if the price of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> included the cost of solar energy collection, concentration and manufacturing of raw <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels.</b> Moreover, burning <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> produces enormous environmental, human health and welfare costs and damage. Virtually no legal literature on ecosystem services, sustainable development, or sustainable energy, considers <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> in this context. Without understanding stored energy as an ecosystem service, we cannot reasonably expect to manage our <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> energy resources sustainably. International and domestic energy law and policy systems generally ignore this feature of <b>fossil</b> <b>fuel</b> energy, a blind spot that explains why reducing greenhouse gas emissions from <b>fossil</b> <b>fuels</b> is fundamentally a political challenge. This paper will use new understandings emerging from the field of complex systems to critique existing legal decision-making models that do not adequately account for energy ecosystem services in policy design, resource allocation and project approvals. The paper proposes a new "least-social-cost" decision-making legal structure that includes ecosystem energy services...|$|R
