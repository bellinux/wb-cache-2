While the patterns of agency-prime contracting are indicative or relational contracting, the patterns of prime-sub contracting imply relatively more competitive processes.

40|$|We {{attempt to}} {{identify}} {{to what extent}} Total Quality Management (TQM) concepts can be adopted, outside the manufacturing industry, into engineering service organizations. The principles of a leading quality management expert, Philip Crosby, are examined. Our research lead to a hypothesis that organizational implementation of TQM concepts would require a change in management approach and bring about a 2 ̆ 2 paradigm shift 2 ̆ 2 toward the human subsystem. In order to provide better quality in service organizations, the human subsystem obviously had to be improved. Survey results of ninety top <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> <b>service</b> firms confirmed widespread management knowledge of quality improvement concepts of TQM, zero defects, 2 ̆ 2 do it right the first time, 2 ̆ 2 etc., and the implementation of quality improvement programs in the work place.

40|$|Theories of {{evolutionary}} economics have developed concepts of routines for both operational and innovative activities, indicating {{the extent to}} which such routines shape the trajectories of technological change. However, the concept of innovative routines has primarily been illustrated with examples from manufacturing, and little is known about its relevance for innovation processes in services. This paper examines innovation in engineering consultancy, in order to identify the role and nature of innovative routines for a knowledge-intensive business service. It is concluded {{that it is difficult to}} distinguish operational routines from innovative routines in <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> <b>services.</b> Moreover, innovative routines are contingent on the institutional context of engineering consultancy business and, in particular, on the effects of widespread use of information and communication technologies...|$|E
40|$|A {{technical}} {{basis for}} the definition of services, using the so-called IHIP characteristics, is rejected in favour of one based on institutional arrangements. Mundane Transaction Costs {{and the notion of}} qualification are discussed in relation to making services tradable. The evolution of the Business Model concept from e-business to wider usage is briefly reviewed, and its applicability to complex product-service systems considered. Four common elements are identified: the structure of networks; how transactions are made possible; how payments are made; and how information and knowledge are transferred. These ideas are then applied to a case study concerning the offshore subcontracting of <b>engineering</b> <b>design</b> <b>services</b> by Rolls-Royce aero-engine makers. Three themes of analysis are developed: a chain of services; the process of aggregating and packaging work between organisations; and the multiple, ambiguous and dynamic boundaries of the firm...|$|E
