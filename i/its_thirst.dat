25|$|My first well-remembered {{intentional}} use of {{the double}} bind occurred in early boyhood. One winter day, with the weather below zero, my father led a calf {{out of the barn}} to the water trough. After the calf had satisfied <b>its</b> <b>thirst,</b> they turned back to the barn, but at the doorway the calf stubbornly braced its feet, and despite my father's desperate pulling on the halter, he could not budge the animal. I was outside playing in the snow and, observing the impasse, began laughing heartily. My father challenged me to pull the calf into the barn. Recognizing the situation as one of unreasoning stubborn resistance {{on the part of the}} calf, I decided to let the calf have full opportunity to resist, since that was what it apparently wished to do. Accordingly I presented the calf with a double bind by seizing it by the tail and pulling it away from the barn, while my father continued to pull it inward. The calf promptly chose to resist the weaker of the two forces and dragged me into the barn. Reprinted in Collected Papers Volume 3.|$|E
25|$|The {{story begins}} with the revelation that Seattle, Washington is being plagued by a string of murders, which Edward {{suspects}} {{is caused by a}} new vampire that is unable to control <b>its</b> <b>thirst</b> for human blood. As Edward and Bella apply to colleges, Bella explains to Edward her desire to see her friend, Jacob Black, a werewolf. Although Edward fears for her safety, Bella insists that neither Jacob nor his werewolf pack would ever harm her, and she begins visiting him occasionally. On one of these visits, Jacob tells Bella that he is in love with her, and wants her to choose him instead of Edward, but Bella says she just sees him as a friend. Meanwhile, Alice Cullen has a vision that Victoria, a vampire who is hunting Bella for revenge for the death of James, has returned to Forks. Alice takes Bella away against her wishes for a sleepover. During the sleepover, Bella learns more of Rosalie's past that led to her eventual transformation to a vampire and her real reasons for treasuring humanity. While being a vampire is still her wish, Bella eventually agrees to rethink her decision. A few days later, Edward proposes to Bella and, despite harboring an aversion to marriage, she accepts on the condition that he will make love to her while she's human.|$|E

6000|$|Now it {{is worth}} remarking, that it is Shelley's form of fever, rather than Byron's, which has been of late years the {{prevailing}} epidemic. Since Shelley's poems have become known in England, and a timid public, after approaching in fear and trembling the fountain which was understood to be poisoned, has begun first to sip, and then, finding the magic water at all events sweet enough, to quench <b>its</b> <b>thirst</b> with unlimited draughts, Byron's fiercer wine has lost favour. Well--at least {{the taste of the}} age is more refined, if that be matter of congratulation. And there is an excuse for preferring champagne to waterside porter, heady with grains of paradise and quassia, salt and cocculus indicus. Nevertheless, worse ingredients than oenanthic acid may lurk in the delicate draught, and the Devil's Elixir may be made fragrant, and sweet, and transparent enough, as French moralists well know, for the most fastidious palate. The private sipping of eua-de-cologne, say the London physicians, has increased mightily of late; and so has the reading of Shelley. It is not surprising. Byron's Corsairs and Laras have been, on the whole, impossible during the thirty years' peace! and piracy and profligacy are at all times, and especially nowadays, expensive amusements, and often require a good private fortune--rare among poets. They have, therefore, been wisely abandoned as ideals, except among a few young persons, who used to wear turn-down collars, and are now attempting moustaches and Mazzini hats. But even among them, and among their betters--rather their more-respectables--nine-tenths of the bad influence which is laid at Byron's door really is owing to Shelley. Among the many good-going gentlemen and ladies, Byron is generally spoken of with horror--he is [...] "so wicked," [...] forsooth; while poor Shelley, [...] "poor dear Shelley," [...] is [...] "very wrong, of course," [...] but [...] "so refined," [...] "so beautiful," [...] "so tender"--a fallen angel, while Byron is a satyr and a devil. We boldly deny the verdict. Neither of the two are devils; as for angels, when we have seen one, we shall be better able to give an opinion; at present, Shelley is in our eyes far less like one of those old Hebrew and Miltonic angels, fallen or unfallen, than Byron is. And as for the satyr; the less that is said for Shelley, on that point, the better. If Byron sinned more desperately and flagrantly than he, it was done under the temptations of rank, wealth, disappointed love, and under the impulses of an animal nature, to which Shelley's passions were ...|$|E

40|$|This data {{is from a}} {{study that}} investigates how a honey bee colony {{develops}} and quenches <b>its</b> collective <b>thirst</b> when it experiences hyperthermia of its broodnest, the nest region whose temperature and humidity are precisely regulated. We found that in this emergency situation a colony must strongly boost its water intake because evaporative cooling is critical to avoiding broodnest hyperthermia, and it must rapidly boost its water intake because a colony maintains only a small water reserve. We also shed light on how the worker bees functioning as water collectors know when to spring into action—by sensing either more frequent requests for fluid or greater personal thirst, or both—and we demonstrate that this sensing mechanism is sufficiently fine-tuned to prevent overheating and desiccation of the colony's brood. Finally, {{we found that the}} impressive behavioral flexibility of a colony's water collectors enables them not only to satisfy their colony's current water needs, but also to buffer their colony somewhat against future extreme water stresses by storing water in their crops and in the combs.

60|$|The Anglo-Saxons, {{when they}} settled in Eastern and Southern Britain, were a horde of barbarous heathen pirates. They massacred or enslaved the civilised or half-civilised Celtic {{inhabitants}} with savage ruthlessness. They burnt or destroyed the monuments of Roman occupation. They let the roads and cities fall into utter disrepair. They stamped out Christianity with fire and sword {{from end to end}} of their new domain. They occupied a civilised and Christian land, and they restored it to its primitive barbarism. Nor was there any improvement until Christian teachers from Rome and Scotland once more introduced the forgotten culture which the English pirates had utterly destroyed. As Gildas phrases it, with true Celtic eloquence, the red tongue of flame licked up the whole land from end to end, till it slaked <b>its</b> horrid <b>thirst</b> in the western ocean. For 150 years the whole of English Britain, save, perhaps, Kent and London, was cut off from all intercourse with Christendom and the Roman world. The country consisted of several petty chieftainships, at constant feud with their Teutonic neighbours, and perpetually waging a border war with Welsh, Picts, and Scots. Within each colony, much of the land remained untilled, while the clan settlements appeared like little islands of cultivation in the midst of forest, waste, and common. The villages were mere groups of wooden homesteads, with barns and cattle-sheds, surrounded by rough stockades, and destitute of roads or communications. Even the palace of the king was a long wooden hall with numerous outhouses; for the English built no stone houses, and burnt down those of their Roman predecessors. Trade seems to have been confined to the south coast, and few manufactured articles of any sort were in use. The English degraded their Celtic serfs to their own barbaric level; and the very memory of Roman civilization almost died out of the land for a hundred and fifty years.|$|R
60|$|Now, in {{all these}} instances, let it be observed, for it is to that end alone that I have been arguing all along, that the virtue of the {{imagination}} is its reaching, by intuition and intensity of gaze, (not by reasoning, but by its authoritative opening and revealing power,) a more essential truth than is seen at the surface of things. I repeat that it matters not whether the reader is willing call this faculty imagination or no, I do not care about the name; but I would be understood when I speak of imagination hereafter, to mean this, the true foundation of all art which exercises eternal authority over men's minds; (all other imagination than this is either secondary and contemplative, or utterly spurious;) the base of whose authority and being is <b>its</b> perpetual <b>thirst</b> of truth and purpose to be true. It has no food, no delight, no care, no perception, except of truth; it is forever looking under masks, and burning up mists; no fairness of form, no majesty of seeming will satisfy it; the first condition of its existence is incapability of being deceived; and though it sometimes dwells upon and substantiates the fictions of fancy, yet its own operation is to trace to their farthest limit the true laws and likelihoods even of the fictitious creation. This has been well explained by Fuseli, in his allusion to the Centaur of Zeuxis; {{and there is not}} perhaps a greater exertion of imaginative power than may be manifested in following out to their farthest limits the necessary consequences of such arbitrary combination; but let not the jests of the fancy be confounded with that after serious work of the imagination which gives them all the nervous verity and substance of which they are capable.

40|$|In {{the first}} century AD Aretaeus of Cappadocia {{described}} diabetes as "a wonderful but not very frequent affection among men being a melting down of the flesh and limbs into urine [...] , life is short, disgusting and painful, thirst unquenchable, death inevitable". The recognition of this disease with <b>its</b> enormous <b>thirst</b> and massive production of honey sweet urine is very old. Nowadays diabetes {{is known as a}} heterogeneous disorder. Insufficient production of biologically active insulin is a common denominator in almost all forms of diabetes. Insulin deficiency results in a variety of metabolic abnormalities (hyperglycaemia, increased lipolysis, increased gluconeogenesis at the cost of amino acids). The NIH National Diabetes Data Group discerns 2 types of diabetes mellitus: insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) (National Diabetes Data Group 1979). IDDM frequently starts in childhood. The incidence in the Netherlands is estimated to be 11. 0 subjects per 100. 000 inhabitants per year in the age group below 20 years (Vaandrager 1984). Since NIDDM seldom occurs in childhood it will be left out of consideration in this study. Insulin is produced by beta cells in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. In due time after clinical onset there is hardly any beta cell activity evident. An absolute insulin deficiency ensues. As insulin {{plays a key role in}} maintaining normal metabolism, this implicates a life-long dependency on exogenous insulin administration. Since insulin is a peptide which can not be administered orally, administration of injections at least once daily is necessary. Ten to 15 years after the onset of the disease severe complications may develop (micro- and macroangiopathy) resulting in a shorter life expectancy and a reduced quality of life (Deckert 1978). It is evident that t~is chronic disease and its consequences also influence life, the psychological wellbeing and development of patients, especially those of child age. The cause of this destructive process, which is specifically directed against the pancreatic beta cells, remains to be elucidated. Current thought is that a hereditary susceptibility in combination with an environmental agent can lead to the development of IDDM (Cahill 1981). Immunological disturbances- cellular as well as humoral - have also been found at the onset of the disease (Bottazzo 1981, Buschard 1980, Lernmark 1981, Maron 1983).

The deer looked about for a place where he might escape from the ring of the beaters, and spied one unwatched close to the prince himself. It bounded high and leaped right over his head, got out of the ring, and tore like the eastern wind into the waste. The prince put spurs to his horse and pursued it; and was soon lost to the sight of his followers. Until the world-lighting sun stood above his head in the zenith he did not take his eyes off the deer; suddenly it disappeared behind some rising ground, and with all his search he could not find any further trace of it. He was now drenched in sweat, and he breathed with pain; and his horse's tongue hung from <b>its</b> mouth with <b>thirst.</b> He dismounted and toiled on, with bridle on arm, praying and casting himself on the mercy of heaven. Then his horse fell and surrendered its life to God. On and on he went across the sandy waste, weeping and with burning breast, till at length a hill rose into sight. He mustered his strength and climbed to the top, and there he found a giant tree whose foot kept firm the wrinkled earth, and whose crest touched the very heaven. Its branches had put forth a glory of leaves, and there were grass and a spring underneath it, and flowers of many colours.|$|R
