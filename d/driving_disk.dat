Therefore, positioning the smaller wheel at different points along the larger wheel's surface varies the gear ratio.

50|$|The main or <b>driving</b> <b>disk</b> {{is faced}} with a disk of aluminum. The driven disk has a working rim of elastic fiber. Lambert says in the invention, In {{practice}} I have found that this combination of aluminum and fiber bearing surfaces gives the maximum degree of friction and durability, thereby especially adapting the gearing for use on motor vehicles of the heavier kind, where the friction surfaces are at times subjected to great strains, and must, therefore, have a frictional contact of {{a high degree of}} efficiency in order to avoid slipping. It will be observed that the aluminum is advantageous also, because it will not tarnish or rust appreciably, but will always present a smooth, clean surface to the fiber periphery, so that wear will be reduced to a minimum. The friction disk drive was one of the key features of the Union automobile and Lambert automobile. Lambert started making the friction disk and traversing pinion drive in 1900. The first attempt was with a leather faced disk and an iron friction wheel. It had an eighteen inch diameter with a one and a half inch face. With this first attempt the leather was charred within the first three miles (5 km) of running it. The disk was then made with a wood fiber about a half inch thick. The material had a glossy surface and worked fine for a while, however it broke up after only 200 to 300 mi run. Lambert then conducted various experiments on the friction disk to get better performance. In one experiment a cone of cast aluminum was used as one member of a level friction drive with excellent results. Lambert then realizing that the pull was due to the aluminum itself, a disk was faced with it and the traversing wheel with strawboard. This accidental discovery made Lambert automobiles more successful than other cars that attempted at friction driving.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} several results {{concerning the}} comparison between accretion-related properties of cool (T Tauri; T < 7000 K, M < 1 Msun and hot (Herbig Ae/Be; 7000 < T(K) < 13000; 1 < M(Msun) < 6) pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. This comparison gives insight into the analogies/differences in the physics of the star-disk interaction and in the physical mechanisms <b>driving</b> <b>disk</b> dissipation. Several optical and near-IR line luminosities used for low-mass objects are also valid to estimate typical accretion rates for intermediate-mass stars under similar empirical expressions. In contrast, the Halpha width at 10 % of peak intensity is used as an accretion tracer for T Tauris, but is not reliable to estimate accretion rates for Herbig Ae/Bes. This can be explained {{as a consequence of}} the different stellar rotation rates that characterize both types of stars. In addition, there are similar trends when the accretion rate is related to the near-IR colours and disk masses, suggesting that viscous accretion disk models are able to explain these trends for both T Tauri and Herbig Ae/Be stars. However, there are two major differences between cool and hot PMS objects. First, the inner gas dissipation timescale, as estimated by relating the accretion rates and the stellar ages, is slightly faster for Herbig Ae/Be stars. This could have implications on the physical mechanism able to form planets around objects more massive than the Sun. Second, the relative position of Herbig Ae/Bes with disks showing signs of inner dust clearing in the accretion rate [...] disk mass plane contrasts with that of transitional T Tauri stars, when both samples are compared with "classical", non-evolved disks. This latter difference could be pointing to a different physical mechanism <b>driving</b> <b>disk</b> evolution, depending on the stellar regime.

One key difference is that the lack of reflectional symmetry in the general ε problem means that the linear stability curves for the onset of both steady and oscillatory behavior for both the trivial and the nontrivial equilibrium solutions no longer coincide.

40|$|We report deep Sub-Millimeter Array {{observations}} of 26 pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars with evolved inner disks. These observations measure {{the mass of}} the outer disk (r ~ 20 - 100 AU) across every stage of the dissipation of the inner disk (r < 10 AU) as determined by the IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We find that only targets with high mid-IR excesses are detected and have disk masses in the 1 - 5 M_Jup range, while most of our objects remain undetected to sensitivity levels of M_DISK ~ 0. 2 - 1. 5 M_Jup.

The satellite population has structural and kinematic characteristics modelled to follow the predictions of ΛCDM cosmological simulations. Vertical disk heating is a small effect despite many interactions with the satellite population with only a 20 % increase in vertical velocity dispersion σz and the disk scale height zd at the equivalent solar radius R = 2. 5 Rd. However, the stellar disk is noticeably flared after 10 Gyr with zd nearly doubling at the disk edge. Azimuthal disk heating is much larger with σR and σz both increasing by 1. 7 ×.

40|$|X-ray heating of the {{photosphere}} of an {{accretion disk}} {{is a possible}} mechanism to produce strong, broad UV emission lines in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). However, detailed photoionization calculations show that this mechanism fails to produce sufficient emission measure. We present the results of hydrodynamical calculations of the disk photosphere irradiated by strong X-rays. We attempt to determine whether LMXBs can harbor significant UV-driven disk winds despite the effects of X-ray ionization. Such winds would be a likely candidate for the site of emission of UV lines and may better explain the observations than the X-ray heated disk photosphere. We find that the local disk radiation cannot launch a wind from the disk because of strong ionizing radiation from the central object. Unphysically high X-ray opacities {{would be required to}} shield the UV emitting disk and allow the line force to drive a disk wind. However the same X-ray radiation that inhibits line <b>driving</b> heats the <b>disk</b> and can produce a hot bipolar wind or corona above the disk. To assess the impact of X-ray heating upon <b>driving</b> of a <b>disk</b> wind by the line force in any system with an accretion disk we derive analytic formulae. In particular, we compare results of line-driven disk wind models for accretion disks in LMXBs and active galactic nuclei. The latter show spectral features associated with a strong and fast disk wind. The key parameter determining the role of the line force is not merely the presence of the luminous UV zone in the disk and the presence of the X-rays, but also the distance of this UV zone from the center.

Chandra reveals a line–rich X-ray absorption spectrum consistent with a disk wind. Prior modeling of the spectrum suggested that the wind may be magnetically driven, potentially providing insights {{into the nature of}} disk accretion onto black holes. In this paper, we present results obtained with new models for this spectrum, generated using three independent photoionization codes: XSTAR, Cloudy, and our own code. Fits to the spectrum in particular narrow wavelength ranges, in evenly spaced wavelength slices, and across a broad wavelength band all strongly prefer a combination of high density, high ionization, and small inner radius. Indeed, the results obtained from all three codes require a wind that originates more than 10 times closer to the black hole and carrying a mass flux that is on the order of 1000 times higher than predicted by thermal driving models.

40|$|Gravitationally {{unstable}} accretion disks {{emerge in}} a variety of astrophysical contexts - giant planet formation, FU Orioni outbursts, feeding of AGNs, and the origin of Pop III stars. When a gravitationally unstable disk is unable to cool rapidly it settles into a quasi-stationary, fluctuating gravitoturbulent state, in which its Toomre Q remains close to a constant value Q_ 0 1. Here we develop an analytical formalism describing the evolution of such a disk, which is based on the assumptions of Q=Q_ 0 and local thermal equilibrium. Our approach works in the presence of additional sources of angular momentum transport (e. g. MRI), as well as external irradiation. Thermal balance dictates a unique value of the gravitoturbulent stress α_gt <b>driving</b> <b>disk</b> evolution, which {{is a function of the}} local surface density and angular frequency. We compare this approach with other commonly used gravitoturbulent viscosity prescriptions, which specify the explicit dependence of stress α_gt on Toomre Q in an ad hoc fashion, and identify the ones that provide consistent results. We nevertheless argue that our Q=Q_ 0 approach is more flexible, robust, and straightforward, and should be given preference in applications. We illustrate this with a couple of analytical calculations - locations of the snow line and of the outer edge of the dead zone in a gravitoturbulent protoplanetary disk - which clearly show the simplicity and versatility of the Q=Q_ 0 approach.

40|$|Disk {{accretion}} powers many astronomical objects, including pre-main sequence stars, interacting binary systems, {{and active}} galactic nuclei. Unfortunately, models developed {{to explain the}} behavior of disks and their surroundings - boundary layers, jets, and winds - lack much predictive power, because the physical mechanism <b>driving</b> <b>disk</b> evolution - the viscosity - is not understood. Observations of many types of accreting systems are needed to constrain the basic physics of disks and provide input for improved models. Symbiotic stars are an attractive laboratory for studying physical phenomena associated with disk accretion. These long period binaries (P(sub orb) approx. 2 - 3 yr) contain an evolved red giant star, a hot companion, and an ionized nebula. The secondary star usually is a white dwarf accreting material from the wind of its red giant companion. A {{good example of this}} type of symbiotic is BF Cygni: our analysis shows that disk accretion powers the nuclear burning shell of the hot white dwarf and also manages to eject material perpendicular to the orbital plane (Mikolajewska, Kenyon, and Mikolajewski 1989). The hot components in other symbiotic binaries appear powered by tidal overflow from a very evolved red giant companion. We recently completed a study of CI Cygni and demonstrated that the accreting secondary is a solar-type main sequence star, rather than a white dwarf (Kenyon et aL 1991). This project continued our study of symbiotic binary systems. Our general plan was to combine archival ultraviolet and optical spectrophotometry with high quality optical radial velocity observations to determine the variation of line and continuum sources as functions of orbital phase.

40|$|Black hole [...] {{neutron star}} (BHNS) binary mergers can form disks in which magnetorotational {{instability}} (MRI) -induced turbulence may drive accretion onto the remnant BH, supporting relativistic jets and providing the engine for a short-hard gamma-ray burst (SGRB). Our earlier study of magnetized BHNSs showed that NS tidal disruption winds {{the magnetic field}} into a toroidal configuration, with poloidal fields so weak that capturing MRI with full-disk simulations would require ∼ 10 ^ 8 CPU-hours. In that study we imposed equatorial symmetry, suppressing poloidal magnetic fields that might be generated from plasma crossing the orbital plane. Here we show that initial conditions that break this symmetry (i. e., tilted poloidal magnetic fields in the NS) generate much stronger poloidal fields in the disk, indicating that asymmetric initial conditions may be necessary for establishing BHNS mergers as SGRB progenitors via fully general relativistic MHD simulations. We demonstrate that BHNS mergers may form an SGRB engine under the right conditions by seeding the remnant disk from an unmagnetized BHNS simulation with purely poloidal fields dynamically unimportant initially, but strong enough to resolve MRI. Magnetic turbulence occurs in the <b>disk,</b> <b>driving</b> accretion and supporting Poynting-dominated jet outflows sufficient to power an SGRB.

40|$|Astronomy and Astrophysics 539 (2012) : A 119 {{reproduced}} {{with permission}} from Astronomy and AstrophysicsContext. Circumstellar disks are expected to evolve quickly in massive young clusters harboring many OB-type stars. Two processes have been proposed to drive the disk evolution in such cruel environments: (1) gravitational interaction between circumstellar disks and nearby passing stars (stellar encounters); and (2) photoevaporation by UV photons from massive stars. The relative importance of both mechanisms is not well understood. Studies of massive young star clusters can provide observational constraints on the processes of <b>driving</b> <b>disk</b> evolution. Aims. We investigate the properties of young stars and their disks in the NGC 6357 complex, concentrating on the most massive star cluster within the complex: Pismis 24. Methods. We use infrared data from the 2 MASS and Spitzer GLIMPSE surveys, complemented with our own deep Spitzer imaging of the central regions of Pismis 24, in combination with X-ray data to search for young stellar objects (YSOs) in NGC 6357 complex. The infrared data constrain the disk presence and are complemented by optical photometric and spectroscopic observations, obtained with VLT/VIMOS, that constrain {{the properties of the}} central stars. For those stars with reliable spectral types we combine spectra and photometry to estimate the mass and age. For cluster members without reliable spectral types we obtain the mass and age probability distributions from R and I-band photometry, assuming these stars have the same extinction distribution as those in the "spectroscopic" sample. We compare the disk properties in the Pismis 24 cluster with those in other clusters/star-forming regions employing infrared color-color diagrams. Results. We discover two new young clusters in the NGC 6357 complex. We give a revised distance estimate for Pismis 24 of 1. 7 ± 0. 2 kpc. We find that the massive star Pis 24 - 18 is a binary system, with the secondary being the main X-ray source of the pair. We provide photometry in 9 bands between 0. 55 and 9 μm for the members of the Pismis 24 cluster. We derive the cluster mass function and find that up to the completeness limit at low masses it agrees well with the initial mass function of the Trapezium cluster. We derive a median age of 1 Myr for the Pismis 24 cluster members. We find five proplyds in HST archival imaging of the cluster, four of which are newly found. In all cases the proplyd tails are pointing directly away from the massive star system Pis 24 - 1. One proplyd shows a second tail, pointing away from Pis 24 - 2, suggesting this object is being photoevaporated from two directions simultaneously. We find that the global disk frequency (∼ 30 %) in Pismis 24 is much lower than some other clusters of similar age, such as the Orion Nebula Cluster. When comparing the disk frequencies in 19 clusters/star-forming regions of various ages and different (massive) star content, we find that the disks in clusters harboring extremely massive stars (typically earlier than O 5), like Pismis 24, are dissipated roughly twice as quickly as in clusters/star-forming regions without extremely massive stars. Within Pismis 24, we find that the disk frequency within a projected distance of 0. 6 pc from Pis 24 - 1 is substantially lower than at larger radii (∼ 19 % vs. ∼ 37 %). We argue for a combination of photoevaporation and irradiation with ionizing UV photons from nearby massive stars, causing increased MRI-induced turbulence and associated accretion activity, {{to play an important role}} in the dissipation of low-mass star disks in Pismis 24 M.

40|$|Control Moment Gyroscopes (CMGs) are {{not often}} {{considered}} {{for use on}} small satellites and, as a result few small satellite missions have implemented CMGs as on-board actuators. There are many reasons for this, but mainly this is due {{the complexity of the}} mechanical and control system needed to implement an effective CMG, and also because off-the-shelf CMG systems are generally made for the larger satellite market.. CMGs offer many advantages over reaction wheel systems. When used on a small satellite, a CMG based control system can provide the ability to perform very fast slew maneuvers, making CMGs very attractive to high resolution small satellite imaging missions. The CMG described in this paper incorporates two motors; a Brushless DC Motor (BLDC) and a Stepper Motor. The BLDC provides an efficient means of <b>driving</b> the inertia <b>disk</b> to store the angular momentum, whilst the stepper motor provides precision gimbal control. In order to keep mass and power consumption low, both motors are controlled from a single FPGA. The FPGA runs all associated commutation, speed and position control for both motors and also provides the command and telemetry interface {{to the rest of the}} spacecraft. The resulting system is a compact, power efficient design that is ideal for small satellites...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of high-mass stars is usually accompanied by powerful protostellar outflows. Such high-mass outflows {{are not simply}} scaled-up versions of their lower-mass counterparts, since observations suggest that the collimation degree degrades with stellar mass. Theoretically, the origins of massive outflows remain open to question because radiative feedback and fragmentation of the accretion flow around the most massive stars, with M > 15 M ⊙, may impede the <b>driving</b> of magnetic <b>disk</b> winds. We here present a three-dimensional simulation of {{the early stages of}} core fragmentation and massive star formation that includes a subgrid-scale model for protostellar outflows. We find that stars that form in a common accretion flow tend to have aligned outflow axes, so that the individual jets of multiple stars can combine to form a collective outflow. We compare our simulation to observations with synthetic H 2 and CO observations and find that the morphology and kinematics of such a collective outflow resembles some observed massive outflows, such as Cepheus A and DR 21. We finally compare physical quantities derived from simulated observations of our models to the actual values in the models to examine the reliability of standard methods for deriving physical quantities, demonstrating that those methods indeed recover the actual values to within a factor of two to three...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} latest {{improvements}} in the Center for Radiative Shock Hydrodynamics (CRASH) code, a parallel block-adaptive-mesh Eulerian code for simulating high-energy-density plasmas. The implementation can solve for radiation models with either a gray or a multigroup method in the flux-limited-diffusion approximation. The electrons and ions are allowed {{to be out of}} temperature equilibrium and flux-limited electron thermal heat conduction is included. We have recently implemented a CRASH laser package with 3 -D ray tracing, resulting in improved energy deposition evaluation. New, more accurate opacity models are available which significantly improve radiation transport in materials like xenon. In addition, the HYPRE preconditioner has been added to improve the radiation implicit solver. With this updated version of the CRASH code we study radiative shock tube problems. In our set-up, a 1 ns, 3. 8 kJ laser pulse irradiates a 20 micron beryllium <b>disk,</b> <b>driving</b> a shock into a xenon-filled plastic tube. The electrons emit radiation behind the shock. This radiation from the shocked xenon preheats the unshocked xenon. Photons traveling ahead of the shock will also interact with the plastic tube, heat it, and in turn this can drive another shock off the wall into the xenon. We are now able to simulate the long term evolution of radiative shocks. Comment: submitted to High Energy Density Physic...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{experimental}} activity carried out with the aim to investigate on the adhesive behaviour of visco-elastic materials in sliding contact with road asperities are presented. Experiments are carried out using a prototype of pin on disk machine in which pin is constituted by a specimen of rubber coming from a commercial tire, while different disks are realized in glass, marble, steel and in abrasive paper of different roughness. Tests are performed in {{both dry and wet}} conditions. Roughness of the test surfaces is evaluated by a rugosimeter, while pressure is evaluated, off-line, analysing the extension of the contact patch left by the pin on a sheet of graph paper under known applied loads. Slide velocity is imposed by an inverter controlled motor <b>driving</b> the <b>disk.</b> Basing on well known theoretical hypotheses, adhesive component of friction coefficient is estimated making the specimens slide on surfaces characterized by low values of macro-roughness, in order to underline the differences in rubber behaviour respect to micro-roughness surface variations. The results confirmed adhesion dependence on pressure and sliding velocity in both cases of smooth surfaces, where the main friction mechanism is the adhesive one, and of rough surfaces, where the main friction mechanism is the hysteretic one. Analysing various surfaces roughness it is possible to notice a maximized adhesive contribution on flat surfaces; it reduces with increasing roughness, while hysteretic friction comes over instead of it because of asperities penetration into rubber sliding surface. Moreover in the case of rough surfaces the separation between static and dynamic friction coefficient is evident and the static coefficient is greater than the dynamic one. On the other hand in case of smooth surface the absence of indentation phenomena doesn’t allow to recognize, in the measured force time history, the “classical” peak usually associated to the static friction coefficient. Dry and wet tests performed on different micro-roughness profiles highlighted that friction coefficient in dry conditions is greater on smoother surfaces, while an opposite tendency is shown in wet condition, when asperities are greater enough to break the thin water layer, providing a certain degree of indentation. A proposal for a methodology able to estimate the only adhesive friction component, developed thanks to wet contact tests, is expressed in the end of the paper...|$|R
40|$|Our current {{understanding}} of the physical processes of star formation is reviewed, with emphasis on processes occurring in molecular clouds like those observed nearby. The dense cores of these clouds are predicted to undergo gravitational collapse characterized by the runaway growth of a central density peak that evolves toward a singularity. As long as collapse can occur, rotation and magnetic fields do not change this qualitative behavior. The result is that a very small embryonic star or protostar forms and grows by accretion {{at a rate that}} is initially high but declines with time as the surrounding envelope is depleted. Rotation causes some of the remaining matter to form a disk around the protostar, but accretion from protostellar disks is not well understood and may be variable. Most, and possibly all, stars form in binary or multiple systems in which gravitational interactions can play a role in redistributing angular momentum and <b>driving</b> episodes of <b>disk</b> accretion. Variable accretion may account for some peculiarities of young stars such as flareups and jet production, and protostellar interactions in forming systems of stars will also have important implications for planet formation. The most massive stars form in the densest environments by processes that are not yet well understood but may include violent interactions and mergers. The formation of the most massive stars may have similarities to the formation and growth of massive black holes in very dense environments.
