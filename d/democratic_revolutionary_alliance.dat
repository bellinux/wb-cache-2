Himself a former Sandinista who had held several high posts in the government, he had resigned abruptly in 1981 and defected, believing that the newly found power had corrupted the Sandinista's original ideas. A popular and charismatic leader, Pastora initially saw his group develop quickly. He confined himself to operate {{in the southern part of}} Nicaragua; after a press conference he was holding on 30 May 1984 was bombed, he [...] "voluntarily withdrew" [...] from the contra struggle.|$|E
2500|$|By 1980, {{conflicts}} {{began to}} emerge between the Sandinista and non-Sandinista members of the governing junta. Violeta Chamorro and Alfonso Robelo resigned from the governing junta in 1980, and rumours began {{that members of the}} Ortega junta would consolidate power amongst themselves. These allegations spread, and rumors intensified that it was Ortega's goal to turn Nicaragua into a state modeled after Cuban socialism. In 1979 and 1980, former Somoza supporters and ex-members of Somoza's National Guard formed irregular military forces, while the original core of the FSLN began to splinter. Armed opposition to the Sandinista Government eventually divided into two main groups: The Fuerza Democrática Nicaragüense (FDN), a U.S. supported army formed in 1981 by the CIA, U.S. State Department, and former members of the widely condemned Somoza-era Nicaraguan National Guard; and the Alianza Revolucionaria Democratica (ARDE) <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Alliance,</b> a group that had existed since before the FSLN and was led by Sandinista founder and former FSLN supreme commander, Edén Pastora, a.k.a. [...] "Commander Zero". and Milpistas, former anti-Somoza rural militias, which eventually formed the largest pool of recruits for the Contras. Although independent and often at conflict with each other, these guerrilla bands—along with several others—all became generally known as [...] "Contras" [...] (short for [...] "", en.

5000|$|Joe Fernandez, a Cuban-American, was a protégé of Duane Clarridge in {{the early}} years of the Contra operation. When Clarridge was {{replaced}} by Alan Fiers as the CIA's Central American point man, Fernandez allied himself with the National Security Council's Oliver North rather than Fiers. North and Fernandez sought to revive the anti-Sandinista cause in the south, blaming Edén Pastora's erratic leadership for the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Alliance's</b> moribund state. In early 1986, Fernandez convinced Pastora's field commanders to join Fernando [...] "El Negro" [...] Chamorro, who had allied with the northern-based Nicaraguan Democratic Force. However, his efforts with North to build a strong Contra Southern Front, including aerial resupply of rebel forces in the south by Richard Secord's [...] "Enterprise," [...] enmeshed him in the Iran-Contra Affair.|$|R
50|$|Guillermo Manuel Ungo Revelo (1931 - February 28, 1991) was a Salvadoran social {{democratic}} politician. He {{was a member}} of the ruling government junta from 1979 to 1980. Ungo was for a time the unofficial leader of the opposition in his capacity as president of the <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> Front <b>alliance.</b> He ran in the Salvadoran presidential election of 1972 as the vice presidential running mate of Christian democrat José Napoleón Duarte. Official results showed a victory for the military-backed candidate, Arturo Armando Molina Barraza, though the fairness of the election was widely disputed.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Alliance</b> (Alianza Revolucionaria Democrática or ARDE) {{were the}} Southern Front guerrillas in Nicaragua that {{fought against the}} Marxist {{elements}} of the original Sandinista Revolution in 1979.

5000|$|In {{the absence}} of Fagoth, Rivera became leader and {{spokesperson}} of MINSURASATA. Rivera, framing the Nicaraguan indigenous movement in terms of international human rights, continued to negotiate for indigenous land holdings. His actions were not seen as aligned with the national agenda and was subsequently seen as {{an enemy of the}} state after the Contra War broke out in December 1981. In part to garner forces for MISURA, Fagoth condemned Rivera on the radio by accusing him of working for the Sandinistas; within months, Rivera would leave Nicaragua for Honduras. By 1982 RIvera and other MINSURASATA members were fighting the FSLN with other counterinsurgency forces, including the United States funded [...] <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Alliance</b> (ARDE) based in Costa Rica and led by Eden Pastora.|$|R

50|$|Cruz, Jr. is {{the child}} of Arturo José Cruz Porras and Consuelo Sequeira Ximénez, the firstborn of seven children. As an idealistic youth, Cruz {{supported}} the Sandinistas, only to become disillusioned after they took power. In 1982 {{he turned to the}} charismatic Edén Pastora, the former Sandinista commander starting up the rebel <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Alliance,</b> only to become disenchanted with him as well. Cruz then became involved in 1985 with UNO (United Nicaraguan Opposition), the rebel umbrella group which his father had joined. Trips to Lt. Colonel Oliver North's office at the United States National Security Council brought him into contact with North's secretary, Fawn Hall, with whom he had a well-publicized relationship. After his father's resignation from UNO in March 1987, he attached himself to Aristides Sánchez. Eventually, Cruz left Contra politics, recounting his experience in Memoirs of a Counter-Revolutionary.|$|E

5000|$|The {{strong ties}} to Somoza {{decreased}} the potential to gain domestic support for the FDN, and prevented the U.S. guided unification operation, UNO: [...] "The contra war had {{to be sold to}} Congress and the public as the struggle of an opposition united against the regime in Managua." [...] The revolutionary hero and commander of the Contra force of southern Nicaragua ARDE (Nicaraguan <b>Democratic</b> <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Alliance),</b> Eden Pastora, refused to cooperate with the FDN. When it comes to Pastora, we can see two contrasting images. Pardo-Maurer writes about a problem, a loose gun out of control, someone that has made himself a lot of enemies."Pastora, who cherished his independence, was perceived as the biggest obstacle to this plan unification under UNO. His maverick vision made all his alliances unstable, ultimately costing him the support of his commanders. ... Everybody had an interest in getting rid of Pastora: his commanders, the Americans, the Sandinistas, the other contras." ...|$|E
