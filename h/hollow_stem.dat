5|$|Theophrastus classifies undershrubs as spiny, such as thistle, eryngo and safflower, and spineless, such as marjoram, savory, sage, horehound, and balm. He {{notes that}} some have a <b>hollow</b> <b>stem,</b> such as deadly {{nightshade}} and hemlock. Roses, he writes, vary {{in number of}} petals, roughness of bark, colour and scent; they have five, twelve, twenty or more petals, and those with the sweetest scent come from Cyrene, and are used for making perfume. The times of flowering of different species are listed.|$|E
5|$|In the autumn, {{the leaves}} die {{back and the}} outer scales of the bulb become dry and brittle, so the crop is then {{normally}} harvested. If left in the soil over winter, the growing point {{in the middle of}} the bulb begins to develop in the spring. New leaves appear and a long, stout, <b>hollow</b> <b>stem</b> expands, topped by a bract protecting a developing inflorescence. The inflorescence takes the form of a globular umbel of white flowers with parts in sixes. The seeds are glossy black and triangular in cross section.|$|E

500|$|The cap of E.murrayi is {{bell-shaped}} to conical, {{and measures}} [...] in diameter. It features a sharp umbo in the center. The cap color is bright yellow to orange-yellow, but tends to fade in maturity. The gills have a narrowly adnate {{attachment to the}} stem, and are well-spaced. Initially yellow, they acquire a pinkish tone as the spores mature. The slender <b>hollow</b> <b>stem</b> is [...] long and roughly equal in width throughout its length. It is pale yellow, with a fibrous surface, and often twisted with longitudinal striations. Its surface is smooth, {{and there may be}} a whitish mycelium at the base.

500|$|The cap is convex to bell-shaped, {{sometimes}} {{developing a}} broad umbo before expanding and flattening in age; it reaches {{a diameter of}} [...] In maturity, the cap eventually forms a central depression, and, in some old specimens, opens into the <b>hollow</b> <b>stem.</b> The cap surface is slimy to the touch, and has translucent striations along the margin when moist. The cap is strongly hygrophanous, meaning that it will change color depending on its level of hydration. The color ranges from yellowish brown to golden yellow in young button forms to brownish gray in age, with greenish-gray tints on the margin. The color later changes to whitish from the center to the margin, finally remaining completely white; dried specimens are straw-colored to pale brownish. In contrast to most psilocybin mushrooms, the cap of P.aztecorum {{does not have a}} strong bluing reaction upon injury—only the margin stains slightly green-blue.|$|E

The cap is pallid gray with a whitish margin when young, but soon becomes white overall. The flesh is membranous, fragile, and thin (less than 0.5mm). The gills are free from attachment or narrowly attached (adnexed) to the stem. They are up to 0.5mm broad, distantly-spaced (usually numbering between 7 and 12), and sometimes adhering to each other to form a slight collar (a pseudocollarium) around the stem. They are translucent-white throughout their development, with a fringed, white edge. The <b>hollow</b> <b>stem</b> is [...] long, and usually curved and threadlike. The bottom of the stem is enlarged into a slight bulb, which is initially nearly spherical. At the very base of the stem is a small, white, and hairy disk-like base that attaches to the substrate.

500|$|The [...] in mice {{administered}} cicutoxin by {{intraperitoneal injection}} is 48.3mg per kg body weight (mg/kg); this compares with 5.9mg/kg for mice given potassium cyanide by intraperitoneal injection, while the LD50 for arsenic via intraperitoneal injection in mice is 46.2mg/kg. The exact toxic dose of plant material in humans is unknown; {{it is thought}} ingestion of water hemlock in any quantity can result in poisoning and very small amounts may lead to death. Poisoning has been reported following children blowing whistles made from the <b>hollow</b> <b>stem</b> of water hemlock plants. Intoxication has also been reported following skin contact with the plant; a case was reported where a family of five people rubbed the plant onto the skin and were poisoned, with two children dying. Livestock have long been the worst affected, leading to the common name [...] "cowbane". Poisoning in livestock is common and typically occurs following ingestion of roots of the plant. In the spring when the ground is soft, grazing animals tend to pull the entire plant {{out of the ground}} ingesting both the foiliage and the roots. Roots exposed by ploughing can also be the source of livestock poisonings. Ingestion of plant material may cause death in the animal in as little as 15 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The gills are adnate (broadly {{attached}} to the stem slightly above {{the bottom of the}} gill) or adnexed (reaching the stem, but not {{attached to}} it), and are light violet gray to dark violet brown. They are either uniform in color, or have whitish edges. The <b>hollow</b> <b>stem</b> is [...] by [...] thick, equal in width throughout or thicker at the top, cylindric or sometimes flattened, and either straight or with turns and windings. Its surface is smooth, silky-, whitish to greyish, and stains blue-green irregularly when touched or in age. The base of the stem is densely covered with well-developed white rhizomorphs. Young mushrooms have a white cobweb-like partial veil that does not last long before it disappears, although it sometimes remains as a non-permanent ring on {{the upper part of the}} stem. The flesh is whitish to yellowish or reddish yellow in the cap, or reddish brown in the stem, and shows little or no bluing reaction to injury. Like most of the bluing Psilocybe mushrooms, the odor and taste of P.aztecorum is slightly farinaceous (similar to freshly ground flour) in fresh specimens; dried specimens have a more intense odor. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) stains the cap, stem, and flesh reddish brown; sometimes, the stem does not stain or stains slightly yellowish red. The spore print is blackish violet.|$|E

Its color is reddish brown to orangish brown to yellowish, and it is hygrophanous, fading when dry to a straw or fulvous color. The brownish gills have an adnate to adnexed attachment to the stem; mature gills become purplish black because of the spores. The <b>hollow</b> <b>stem</b> measures [...] long by 1–3mm thick. It is roughly equal in width throughout its length or slightly thicker at the base, and sometimes twisted. A thin rudimentary cortina-like partial veil covers the gills of immature fruit bodies, but it is fragile and disappears soon after the cap expands. The flesh in the cap is whitish, but more yellow in the stem. Both the odor and taste of the mushroom are farinaceous (similar to freshly ground flour). As is characteristic of psilocybin mushrooms, all parts of the fruit body bruise blue when handled or injured. P.hoogshagenii var. convexa lacks an acute papilla, although it occasionally has a small, rounded papilla. Its cap ranges in width from , and it is convex to roughly bell-shaped.

2500|$|The Siana cup {{evolved from}} the komast cup around 575 BC. While the Komast Group {{produced}} shapes other than cups, some craftsmen specialized in cup production after {{the time of the}} first important exemplifier of Siana cups, the C Painter (575-555 BC). The cups have a higher rim than previously and a trumpet-shaped base on a relatively short <b>hollow</b> <b>stem.</b> For the first time in Attic vase painting the inside of the cup was decorated with framed images (tondo). There were two types of decoration. In the [...] "double-decker" [...] style the cup body and the lip each have separate decorations. In the [...] "overlap" [...] style the image extends over both body and lip. After the second quarter of the 6th century BC there was more interest in decorating especially cups with pictures of athletes. Another important Siana cup painter was the Heidelberg Painter. He, too, painted almost exclusively Siana cups. His favorite subject was the hero Heracles. The Heidelberg Painter is the first Attic painter to show him with the Erymanthian boar, with Nereus, with Busiris and in the garden of the Hesperides. The Cassandra Painter, who decorated mid-sized cups with high bases and lips, marks the end of the development of the Siana cup. He is primarily significant as the first known painter to belong to the so-called Little Masters, a large group of painters who produced the same range of vessels, known as Little-master cups. So-called Merrythought cups were produced contemporaneously with Siana cups. Their handles are in the form of a two-pronged fork and end in what looks like a button. These cups do not have a delineated rim. They also have a deeper bowl with a higher and narrower foot.|$|E
