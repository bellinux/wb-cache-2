50|$|IQ {{imbalance}} is a performance-limiting {{issue in}} the design of direct conversion receivers, also known as zero intermediate frequency (IF) or homodyne receivers. Such a design translates the received radio frequency (RF, or passband) signal directly from the carrier frequency (fc) to baseband using only one mixing stage. The traditional heterodyne receiver structure needs an intermediate-frequency (IF) stage between the RF and baseband signals. The direct conversion receiver structure does not have an IF stage, and does not need an image rejection filter. Due to the lower component count, it is easier to integrate. However, a direct-conversion RF front-end suffers from two major drawbacks: one is IQ imbalance and the other is DC offset. When designing a <b>homodyne</b> <b>receiver,</b> control of IQ imbalance is necessary to limit signal demodulation error.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 The recent {{demand for}} {{wireless}} transceivers {{has created a}} flurry of research into nontraditional receiver architectures. The <b>homodyne</b> <b>receiver,</b> because of its high degree of integration, low complexity and low power consumption, has surfaced a desirable alternative to the well-known heterodyne receiver. However, distortions such as gain and phase imbalance severely degrade {{the performance of the}} <b>homodyne</b> <b>receiver.</b> These imbalances, which are caused by impairments of the employed analog devices, are intensified because quadrature demodulation is performed at very high frequencies with a weak input signal. Thus, there exists a great need for low complexity techniques to compensate for these imbalances. In this thesis, we present a new, simplified method for the estimation and the correction of the gain and phase imbalances in a <b>homodyne</b> <b>receiver.</b> The estimation process is based upon carrier re-injection during idle periods of the mobile unit and thus requires only few additional analog components. This approach will be shown to yield tight estimates of the gain and the phase error. Additionally, the correction is performed in the digital domain and thus can be implemented on a digital signal processor. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated via simulations of an IS- 54 transceiver. IS- 54 is the North American TDMA standard for dual-mode cellular systems...|$|E

At present, most receivers in communication systems adopt the superheterodyne technique. However, superheterodyne receivers have some disadvantages, for example, complex circuitry, {{high power consumption}} {{and the existence of}} an image-frequency signal. Compared to <b>Homodyne</b> <b>receiver,</b> the receiver can eliminate the IF stage and band pass and band reject filters. A <b>Homodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> scheme constructed with an antenna, low noise amplifier (LNA), a local oscillator (LO), a mixer, a phase shifter and filters is shown in Figure 3. 1. The properties of the <b>homodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> is compact circuitry and low power consumption, are desirable for RFIC technology for GSM digital cellular telephone handset. In practice, the <b>homodyne</b> <b>receiver</b> has the following advantages; the compact front-end reduces the interconnection loss between the antenna and circuits; it eliminates the need for conventional circuits and saves printed circuit band space; it is compatible with BPSK, QPSK, FSK, and QAM systems and also applies to beam forming array systems; and is capable of supporting shot range indoor wireless communication such as high-speed digital video signals. In this project, homodyne receivers are implemented based on the active antenna concept. The 50 ? loops across the circular patch antenna will act as a phase shifter.

Later on, it has been used in radar applications. It was not until recently that communications receivers have been built upon the six-port principle. However, in all publications, there is always a certain mystic about the six-port.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} demand of broadband capability and reconfigurability for mobile applications, {{there is an enormous}} interest to develop appropriate analog receiver front-ends. In this respect, one promising candidate group is the Six-Port-based direct conversion receiver. The presented work focuses on the investigation of Six-Port-based mobile receiver front-ends with their specific systematical signal processing. Thereby, issues of spurious interfering signals which are generated within the down conversion process of such receivers are of special interest. Based on a comprehensive description of the analog signal processing within additive frequency conversion, a reason could be identified why existing Six-Port receivers have not found any practical application in mobile communication yet – the dynamic DC-offset. With this insight compensation techniques were developed to overcome the negative influences of the dynamic DC-offset. Furthermore, this work presents novel Six-Port-based receiver architectures which, on the one hand, keep the advantages of additive mixing systems like: low power consumption, broadband capability and simplicity of implementation especially for mm-wave transmissions. On the other hand, these novel architectures comprise compensation techniques such that systematically generated spurious signals are inherently compensated in the analog part of the receiver. Moreover, the influence of impairments of phase and amplitude within the IQ-branches of a receiver was investigated. The resulting, unwanted IQ-imbalance was shown to be a mixing method (multiplicative or additive) independent spurious effect. It is suggested to compensate for IQ-imbalance in the digital part of the receiver system. This can be realized with the use of adaptive algorithms.
