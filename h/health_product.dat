25|$|Another {{important}} component of increased interest and funding has come from industry. In 2012, they contributed 13.1% total to the kinetoplastid research and development effort, and have additionally {{played an important role}} by contributing to public-private partnerships (PPP) as well as product-development partnerships (PDP). A public-private partnership is an arrangement between one or more public entities and one or more private entities that exists to achieve a specific health outcome or to produce a <b>health</b> <b>product.</b> The partnership can exist in numerous ways; they may share and exchange funds, property, equipment, human resources, and intellectual property. These public-private partnerships and product-development partnerships have been established to address challenges in pharmaceutical industry, especially related to neglected disease research. These partnerships can help increase the scale of the effort towards therapeutic development by using different knowledge, skills, and expertise from different sources. These types of partnerships {{have been shown to be}} more effective than industry or public groups working independently.|$|E

The ban on the import, export, and use of most mercury-based products began on 1 January 2008. The Norwegian officials stressed {{that this is not}} a decision based on using an unsafe <b>health</b> <b>product,</b> but rather that the [...] "overall, long term goal is to eliminate the use and release of mercury to the environment". Despite the mercury ban, dental offices in Norway may apply for exemptions to use amalgam on a case-by-case basis.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse trade flows and tariff policies of <b>health</b> <b>products.</b> Compared to previous studies, we not only focus on medicines, but on a large set of products that enter the public health space and can be identified in the common trade classification. The first contribution is thus to construct three groups of <b>health</b> <b>products</b> based on the 2007 Harmonized System classification of international trade. Using these commodity groups, we analyse trade flows between 167 countries for the years 1996 to 2009. We find that trade in <b>health</b> <b>products</b> has developed very dynamically, with trade in dosified medicine displaying the strongest growth with an annual growth rate of almost 12 per cent. The results further indicate that the market of <b>health</b> <b>products</b> is dominated by a small number of developed countries. Looking at tariffs on <b>health</b> <b>products</b> for developed and developing countries as well as LDCs and transition economies we find that the overall level of tariffs is low, but far from being zero, especially in the last three country groups. Finally, studying the tariffs on <b>health</b> <b>products</b> in preferential trade agreements between developing countries, the results show that the tariff level is low, but in some individual cases still substantive...|$|R
