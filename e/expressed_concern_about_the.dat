5|$|In 1915, {{the owner}} of the tower, H. J. Wood, {{discussed}} selling it to the Commissioners of Works, proposing a price of approximately Â£1,500; the negotiations broke down. By the 1930s, local magistrates <b>expressed</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> tower and the risk that it might fall over onto the grounds of a neighbouring private asylum, the Kent Sanatorium, endangering the patients. As an alternative to demolition, it was taken into the guardianship of the Office of Works in 1937.|$|E

5|$|Human {{rights groups}} such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, {{as well as the}} United States Department of State and the European Union, have <b>expressed</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> state of human rights in Sri Lanka, and both the {{government}} of Sri Lanka and the rebel LTTE have been accused of human rights violations. Although Amnesty International in 2003 found considerable improvement in the human rights situation, attributed to a ceasefire and peace talks {{between the government and the}} LTTE, by 2007 they reported an escalation in political killings, child recruitment, abductions, and armed clashes, which created a climate of fear in the north and east of the country.|$|E
5|$|Labor unions, politicians, advocates, educators, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, {{and human}} rights {{advocacy}} organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have <b>expressed</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> impartiality of the trial of Abu-Jamal. Amnesty International neither takes {{a position on the}} guilt or innocence of Abu-Jamal nor classifies him as a political prisoner. They are opposed by the family of Daniel Faulkner, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the City of Philadelphia, Republican politicians, and the Fraternal Order of Police. In August 1999, the Fraternal Order of Police called for an economic boycott against all individuals and organizations that support Abu-Jamal.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials <b>expressed</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal and state officials resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E

5|$|In late 1990 after Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded and {{occupied}} Kuwait, ultimately {{leading to the}} Gulf War, American commentators and Middle East experts <b>expressed</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possible consequences of the Arab street in the region rising up in support of Saddam against their own governments, many of whom (particularly Egypt) had joined the military coalition led by the United States. This did not happen when the actual war began, nor for the hundred days of combat before Iraqi forces retreated and surrendered. A year later, in 1992, David Pollock of the United States Information Agency (USIA) wrote a lengthy paper arguing that those commentators had seriously misunderstood the Arab street and, by extension, all Arab public opinion.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-2000s, Great Southern's {{business}} was growing rapidly, with sales and market capitalisation increasing {{at more than}} 100 per cent per annum. However, in its 2005 Annual Report, the company disclosed that it was subsidising the returns to its 1994 forestry scheme by approximately A$3 million, and that it expected to have to similarly subsidise the 1995 and 1996 schemes by up to A$12 million in future years. Board Chairman Peter Patrikeos and non-executive director Jeffry Mews both <b>expressed</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way in which Great Southern was funding shortfalls on the sales of timber products, with the issue leading directly to Mews' resignation. Although the company continued to sell over A$800 million of MIS products in the two financial years after incurring losses on its early offerings, it was not meeting sales targets, and its share price was falling.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1755 earthquake, Boston and its {{surrounding}} towns have become a major metropolitan area. Much new construction has been built on infill, especially in the Back Bay area, which may be prone to greater shaking and to compaction of the sand and gravel used as fill. Many older buildings in the Boston area are built from stone and brick, {{and are likely to}} collapse completely during a major earthquake. Given this, modern observers have <b>expressed</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effects of another quake in such a major city. A 1990 study by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency estimated potential financial losses at between $4 billion and $5 billion, and potential loss of life in the hundreds. As a consequence, the state has updated building codes and zoning laws to require that new construction and additions in vulnerable areas be built to resist earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} {{stated purpose}} of GRCs was {{to guarantee a}} minimum representation of minorities in Parliament and ensure that {{there would always be}} a multiracial Parliament instead of one made up of a single race. Speaking in Parliament during the debate on whether GRCs should be introduced, First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Goh Chok Tong said he had first discussed the necessity of ensuring the multiracial nature of Parliament with Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew in July 1982. Then, Lee had <b>expressed</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> voting patterns of younger Singaporeans, who appeared to be apathetic to the need of having a racially balanced slate of candidates. He was also worried about more Singaporeans voting along racial lines, which would lead to a lack of minority representation in Parliament.|$|E
