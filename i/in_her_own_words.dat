Rather than waiting for her fiancé to surprise her 1  day, as depicted in the ads, she enlisted him into investing quite a few weekends with her, trekking between many jewellery shops in Nanjing, before finally settling on her ring of choice: a half-carat diamond engagement ring costing 20, 000 yuan.

5000|$|In both cases, the one {{doing the}} {{interview}} {{should be careful}} not to ask [...] "yes or no"-questions, but to get the subject to tell [...] "the story of his or <b>her</b> life", <b>in</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> This is called the [...] "narrative" [...] method. It is common practice to begin the interview with the subject's early childhood and to proceed chronologically to the present. Another approach, dating from the Polish Peasant, is to ask participants to write their own life stories. This can be done either through competitions (as in Poland, Finland or Italy) or by collecting written life stories written spontaneously. In these countries, there are already large collections of life stories, which can be used by researchers.|$|R

500|$|Historian Robert Bartlett has {{commented that}} [...] "one {{of the largest}} {{uncertainties}} in {{the whole story of}} the death and resurrection of William Cragh is why Lady Mary [...] interceded for him", but intercede she did. John of Baggeham, when questioned about her motivation 18 years after the event, could only reply that [...] "Lady Mary had sought the body of this William, he did not know why". [...] Before the execution she had asked her husband to spare the two condemned men, but he had refused. Then on hearing that Trahaern ap Hywel was dead, and believing that Cragh was still alive, she once again asked that he be handed over to her, but de Briouze delayed until he was convinced that Cragh was also dead. Then [...] "he granted him [...] to the said lady, such as he was, and ordered him to be taken down from the gallows". Lady Mary had [...] "a special devotion" [...] to Thomas de Cantilupe, the deceased Bishop of Hereford, and <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> upon hearing of Cragh's death, [...] "on bended knee, she asked Saint Thomas de Cantilupe to ask God to restore life to William Cragh".|$|E
500|$|Julie Barak {{emphasizes}} {{the significance of}} [...] "one other stylistic idiosyncrasy {{of the work that}} adds to the sophistication of [...] artistry" [...] as there is a marked transition from third to first person narration for each girl in the last section of the novel. Luis describes this shift as a pivotal moment after which the events assume a chronological order and time accelerates, illuminating life in such a manner that it suddenly makes sense. The manner in which Alvarez alters the narrative voice is a stylistic expression {{of the extent to which}} each one of the girls [...] "wants to be in control of her own version of her history... These first person narratives in the last section become, in effect, a defense offered by each girl <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> an explanation of who they have become in the present, of why they 'turned out' the way they have." [...] The transition of narrative voice [...] "changes the dynamic of the reader-character-author triad" [...] and allows for the reader, who has been kept at a distance by the third person narrator, to relive [...] "the memory with the character, closely connected to her, developing a strong empathy with a unified character".|$|E

When I left you I went to answer her note personally. She was not only distressed to hear of Mr. Keller's illness, she was interested enough in my sad news to ask particularly in what form the illness declared itself. When I mentioned what the symptoms were, she showed an agitation which took me quite by surprise. 'Do the doctors understand what is the matter with him?' she asked. I told her that one of the doctors was evidently puzzled, and that the other had acknowledged that the malady was so far incomprehensible to him.

But an old maid is nothing if she be not kind and good. She acknowledged that, and, acknowledging it, added the postscript to her letter.

40|$|Thesis (D. M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityThis {{qualitative}} research explored how the retelling {{of a life}} story influenced teachers' self-understanding. Informed by the disciplines of psychology, anthropology, and philosophy I constructed a conceptual framework {{of life as a}} continuous narrative, reflected and focused by past and anticipated experiences. This framework was informed by Dewey's concept of continuous flowing life experiences, Bakhtin's understanding of the dialogic nature of those experiences, Husserl's explanation ofthe role of memory in that experiential dialogue and Bruner's writings regarding life-as-narrative. Through this lens, the potential for wholeness of identity was explored by making visible the connections between past and present life experiences and observing how each impacts understanding of the other. Using the narrative inquiry method, life-story interview, the researcher wrote guided autobiographies with three music teachers. Individual interviews with participants were conducted, facilitating their storytelling. From these interviews, each participant's life story was written <b>in</b> his or <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> Interpretations from theories that arose from their stories were offered. Viewed through Bruner's metaphor of participants' canons (how they believed the world was) and exceptionalities (the ways their lives grew away from their canons), the research suggested that each lived experience informs and reframes another, making the aim not reconciliation, but accepting that the process of becoming is one's Self, and that our identity is not found in an event, or an understanding, but a continuous act of invention and discovery. Among conclusions was the importance of life reflections as a continuing tool in music teacher personal and professional development. Specific implications for music educators, music teacher educators and for future research were also discussed...|$|R
