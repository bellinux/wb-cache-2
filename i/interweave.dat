5|$|A Song of Ice and Fire {{takes place}} on the fictional continents Westeros and Essos. The {{point of view of}} each chapter in the story is a limited {{perspective}} of a range of characters growing from nine, in the first novel, to thirty-one by the fifth. Three main stories <b>interweave</b> a dynastic war among several families for control of Westeros, the rising threat of the supernatural Others in the northernmost reaches of Westeros, and the ambition of Daenerys Targaryen, the deposed king's exiled daughter, to assume the Iron Throne.|$|E
5|$|Alliteration is the {{repetition}} of letters or letter-sounds {{at the beginning of}} two or more words immediately succeeding each other, or at short intervals; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words. Alliteration and assonance {{played a key role in}} structuring early Germanic, Norse and Old English forms of poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry <b>interweave</b> meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure, so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur. This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry, where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas. Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{nothing of}} the {{original}} church—built {{on the site of}} a wooden Saxon church—remains, apart from unique examples of Celtic stonework, including a plait <b>interweave</b> and a bas-relief of the Virgin and Child, which was carved around 1000 AD. The current building still has a quoin, which was probably a re-cycled Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. The stone southern entrance to the church still stands; it was built in the 12th century and is a typical example of Norman stonework. The church was re-consecrated in 1287 by the bishop of Candida Casa under the direction of John le Romeyn, Archbishop of York. The tall windows set in the church wall both north and south of the nave can be dated to approximately 1320 to 1330, and in the top sections of two of the windows, small fragments of medieval glass can be found. A sideways orientated tombstone can be found under a low arch {{on the inside of the}} southern wall, generally believed to be that of Sir Richard Pickering (d. 1441), a member of the Pickering family who ruled the village of Oswaldkirk from the 14th century into the 16th century.|$|E

500|$|Some topological spaces may be {{endowed with}} a group law. In order for the group law and the {{topology}} to <b>interweave</b> well, the group operations must be continuous functions, that is, , and g−1 must not vary wildly if g and h vary only little. Such groups are called topological groups, {{and they are the}} group objects in the category of topological spaces. The most basic examples are the reals R under addition, , and similarly with any other topological field such as the complex numbers or p-adic numbers. All of these groups are locally compact, so they have Haar measures and can be studied via harmonic analysis. The former offer an abstract formalism of invariant integrals.

Several methods helpful {{for a better}} understanding and a better anticipation of the territorial dynamics are proposed. During these dynamics, potential changes of the territorial systems depend on interactions and <b>interweaving,</b> which are spatial, reticular and scalars as well. These kinds of interactions can occur both, in long time temporality but also in short time temporality.

500|$|Unlike {{previous}} Sleater-Kinney albums, {{most of the}} lyrical themes on The Hot Rock {{are more}} intimate, exploring failed relationships and personal uncertainty. As Weiss recalled, the songs are [...] "really honest, even if they're sometimes unpleasant. The lyrics evoke so many emotions. Our analogies are visual and the metaphors are direct. Corin and Carrie are singing about things they care about". The album features a notable amount of vocal and guitar interplay between Tucker and Brownstein, who <b>interweave</b> their voices and play off each other to create very atmospheric songs such as [...] "The End of You" [...] and [...] "Burn Don't Freeze". Music critic Robert Christgau said that [...] "even reading the booklet it's hard {{to keep track of}} who's saying what to whom about what, as if they'd fallen in love with (or to) the Velvets' 'Murder Mystery'".|$|E

According to Chuck D, the song features [...] "about forty-five to fifty [...] voices" [...] that <b>interweave</b> {{as part of an}} assertive sonic collage and underscore the album’s themes. [...] "Incident at 66.6 FM", another collage that segues into [...] "Welcome to the Terrordome", contains snippets from a radio call-in show interview of Chuck D and alludes to the media persecution perceived by Public Enemy.

[...] condemns the record industry's exploitation of black recording artists and calls for reparations. [...] "Revolutionary Generation" [...] celebrates the strength and endurance of black women with lyrics related to black feminism, an unfamiliar topic in hip hop. It also addresses sexism within the black community and misogyny in hip hop culture.|$|E

500|$|Kampung Boys episodes {{follow a}} {{structure}} reminiscent of Hollywood cartoons. [...] Each episode contains two separate stories whose themes <b>interweave</b> {{each other as}} the show switches between scenes of the two stories. [...] By {{the end of the}} episode, the two threads are resolved by a common idea. [...] Generally, one story focuses on the kampung children, and the other on the adults. [...] The creators of Kampung Boy refrained from copying ideas commonly found in Western and Japanese cartoons. [...] Other Malaysian animations produced since the 1990s have not been as meticulously faithful to portraying images and themes familiar to the localsfor example, Sang Wiras (1996) protagonist bears a striking resemblance to Doraemon, and the bear and bee in Ngat dan Taboh (2002) play out antics similar to those of Tom and Jerry. [...] Lat's close involvement with the project kept its portrayals faithful to Malaysian culture. [...] Kampung life in the animation features [...] "true-blue Malaysian elements" [...] such as supernatural superstitions (pontianaks or female vampires), monkeys trained to pluck coconuts, and traditions that are forgotten in the transition from rural to urban living.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} of Bionicle had been portrayed {{in various ways}} across multiple media, including the official comics, Flash animations used for online videos, and CGI commercials for the sets. The team {{decided to use the}} models from the CGI commercials as their working base for the film models. Before commencing with designing the characters, the team went to Lego's Denmark headquarters and received lessons in the Bionicle design process. The team were originally not going to alter the characters that much, but they needed them to be emotive, which necessitated a redesign. The first step in creating the character models was redrawing the skeleton, then adding muscle pods that would <b>interweave</b> with the skeleton: the muscle gave the characters a more textured appearance, and were added to the shoulders, calves, abdomen and chest cavity. Each character was given a [...] "heart light", a pulsating light in their chest which would fluctuate even when the character was stationary in-shot. They also adjusted the eyes, making the sockets shallower than on the sets and giving them a pupil-like glow. While redesigning the Toa, the team consulted with the original Lego staff to determine what materials the characters were made of: the muscles were compared to rubber, the bones described as a mesh of titanium alloy and carbon fibre, while the armour was made of Kevlar. In general, the outer shells remained mostly unchanged from the sets, although the visible gears were removed and armour was fitted to their backs. The Toa were also bulked up a little when compared to their sets so their feats would be believable for viewers.|$|E
500|$|Following {{completion}} of the game, the player finds additional texts that expand the story. The ending {{of the game is}} purposely ambiguous, and has been subject to multiple interpretations. One theory, based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb—"Now we are all sons of bitches"—is that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development. Some also refer to {{the name of the game}} as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time, demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game. Journalists have considered Braids plot to be interwoven with the game itself, much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind <b>interweave</b> the narrative into the work's construction. In this sense, some have considered the game to carry a simple credo, such as [...] "You must look back to go forwards" [...] as suggested by Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead. Others have likened Braid to punk rock, designed (as explicitly stated by Blow) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts, such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros., and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design. Blow has stated that there is more than one interpretation of the story; he [...] "would not be capable" [...] of explaining the whole story of the game in words, and said that the central idea is [...] "something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly." [...] Blow considered Braid to be [...] "about the journey, not the destination". He deliberately designed the plot not to be fully revealed to the player unless they completed the game, seeing it as a way to provide [...] "a longer-term challenge".|$|E
