40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{the result of a}} user study {{to assess the impact of}} {{resolution}} and frame rate of video on the quality of experience of the users, when the video is rendered inside a 3 -D virtual space, and consequently viewed from arbitrary perspectives. A mathematical model for video rate is presented that expresses the total rate as the product of separate functions of spatial and temporal resolutions. Results from the user study are combined with the model to predict the rate parameters which will result in perceptually acceptable quality using the 3 -D features of the virtual environment. The results show that by exploiting the <b>insensitivity</b> <b>of</b> users to <b>controlled</b> quality degradation, the downstream network load for the client can be significantly reduced with little or no perceptual impact on the clients...|$|R

30|$|The <b>insensitivity</b> <b>of</b> the {{anterior}} negativity to semantics—particularly {{in contrast to}} the P 600 —is important in two respects. First, it shows that, as in sentence processing, anterior negativities are sensitive to aspects of structure, independent of semantics (Münte, Matzke, & Johannes, 1997). A separation between meaning and grammar was also inferred from the <b>insensitivity</b> <b>of</b> the N 400 (an index of semantic processing) to narrative structure (Cohn, Paczynski, et al., 2012 a). Here we show the reverse: {{the anterior}} negativity is insensitive to semantic incongruity.|$|R

40|$|Endo-β- 1, 4 -xylanases (EC 3. 2. 1. 8; endoxylanases), key enzymes in the {{degradation}} of xylan, are considered {{to play an important}} role in phytopathogenesis, as they occupy a prominent position in the arsenal of hydrolytic enzymes secreted by phytopathogens to breach the cell wall and invade the plant tissue. Plant endoxylanase inhibitors are increasingly being pinpointed as part of a counterattack mechanism. To understand the surprising XIP-type endoxylanase inhibitor <b>insensitivity</b> <b>of</b> endoxylanases XylA and XylB from the phytopathogen Fusarium graminearum, an extensive mutational study of these enzymes was performed. Using combinatorial and site-directed mutagenesis, the XIP <b>insensitivity</b> <b>of</b> XylA as well as XylB was proven to be solely due to amino acid sequence adaptations in the “thumb” structural region. While XylB residues Cys 141, Asp 148, and Cys 149 were shown to prevent XIP interaction, the XIP <b>insensitivity</b> <b>of</b> XylA could be ascribed to the occurrence of only one aberrant residue, i. e., Val 151. This study, in addition to providing a thorough explanation for the XIP <b>insensitivity</b> <b>of</b> both F. graminearum endoxylanases at the molecular level, generated XylA and XylB mutants with altered inhibition specificities and pH optima. As this is the first experimental elucidation of the molecular determinants dictating the specificity of the interaction between endoxylanases of phytopathogenic origin and a plant inhibitor, this work sheds more light on the ongoing evolutionary arms race between plants and phytopathogenic fungi involving recognition of endoxylanases...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAlthough {{many studies}} {{concerning}} the sensitivity mechanism of scorpion toxin-potassium channel interactions have been reported, few have explored the biochemical <b>insensitivity</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> potassium channel receptors toward natural scorpion toxin peptides, {{such as the}} KCNQ 1 channel. Here, by sequence alignment analyses of the human KCNQ 1 channel and scorpion potassium channel MmKv 2, which is completely insensitive to scorpion toxins, we proposed that the <b>insensitivity</b> mechanism <b>of</b> KCNQ 1 toward natural scorpion toxins might involve two functional regions, the turret and filter regions. Based on this observation, a series of KCNQ 1 mutants were constructed to study molecular mechanisms of the KCNQ 1 channel insensitivity toward natural scorpion toxins. Electrophysiological studies of chimera channels showed that the channel filter region controls KCNQ 1 insensitivity toward the classical scorpion toxin ChTX. Interestingly, further residue mutant experiments showed that a single basic residue in the filter region determined the <b>insensitivity</b> <b>of</b> KCNQ 1 channels toward scorpion toxins. Our present work showed that amino acid residue diversification at common sites controls the sensitivity and <b>insensitivity</b> <b>of</b> potassium channels toward scorpion toxins. The unique <b>insensitivity</b> mechanism <b>of</b> KCNQ 1 toward natural scorpion toxins will accelerate the rational design of potent peptide inhibitors toward this channel...|$|R
