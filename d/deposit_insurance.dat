5|$|The National Bureau of Economic Research dates recessions on {{a monthly}} basis back to 1854; {{according}} to their chronology, from 1854 to 1919, there were 16 cycles. The average recession lasted 22 months, and the average expansion 27. From 1919 to 1945, there were six cycles; recessions lasted an average 18 months and expansions for 35. From 1945 to 2001, and 10 cycles, recessions lasted an average 10 months and expansions an average of 57 months. This has prompted some economists to declare that the business cycle has become less severe. Factors that may have contributed to this moderation include the creation of a central bank and lender of last resort, like the Federal Reserve System in 1913, the establishment of <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> {{in the form of the}} Federal <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> Corporation in 1933, increased regulation of the banking sector, the adoption of interventionist Keynesian economics, and the increase in automatic stabilizers in the form of government programs (unemployment insurance, social security, and later Medicare and Medicaid).

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{considers}} the capital {{structure of a}} bank in a continuous-time regime-switching economy. The modeling framework takes into account various categories of instruments, including equity, contingent convertible debts, straight debts, <b>deposits</b> and <b>deposits</b> <b>insurance.</b> Whereas previous researches concentrate on {{the determination of the}} capital structure that maximizes shareholders' equity, this work focuses on the fair pricing of liabilities that ensures no cross-subsidization among stakeholders. This is discussed in a case study where the bank's EBIT is modeled by a four-regime process and is fitted to real market data. A numerical analysis reveals that convertible debts can significantly reduce the cost of <b>deposits</b> <b>insurance</b> and straight debts as well as probabilities of bankruptcy. Although it is found that the risk of dilution for shareholders is important, paradoxically, a high conversion rate for the contingent convertible debt, compensated by a low interest cost before conversion, can delay this dilution. Finally, we find that in case of change of economic regime, there exists an optimal capital structure from the shareholder's perspective...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} few years Turkey {{experienced}} a serious financial crisis. In the aftermath of this crisis, immediate economic effects of the crisis were felt almost in all areas of the business world, and several banks were taken over by the Savings <b>Deposits</b> <b>Insurance</b> Fund (SDIF). The main purpose of this research is to make a bankruptcy prediction of Turkish Commercial Banks using data compiled from the years 1997 and 1999. Logistic Regression was used to form a prediction model with financial ratios. 42 commercial banks were included in this research. Those which were taken over by the Savings <b>Deposits</b> <b>Insurance</b> Fund (SDIF) were determined as failed banks: 8, 3, and 7 in 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. Prediction models were created using 1997 – 1999 period data set and validated using 1999 - 2001 data set for prediction. It was observed that 80 % of failed banks could be predicted two years a priori, and Logistic Regression {{can be used as a}} part of an “early warning ” system. As is known, predicting bank failures reduces the losses incurred and helps avoid misallocation of resources...|$|R

Due to the delay Iceland found itself caught in a classic catch-22 situation, loans from other countries could not be secured until the IMF program had been approved.

He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the Federal <b>Deposit</b> <b>Insurance</b> Corporation, to accept less than full payment. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{banks were}} {{deregulated}} in Iceland. This {{set the stage}} for banks to upload debts when foreign companies were accumulated. The crisis unfolded when banks became unable to refinance their debts. It is estimated that the three major banks held foreign debt in excess of €50 billion, or about €160,000 per Icelandic resident, compared with Iceland's gross domestic product of €8.5 billion. As early as March 2008, the cost of private <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance</b> for deposits in Landsbanki and Kaupthing was already far higher (6–8½% of the sum deposited) than for other European banks. The króna, which was ranked by The Economist in early 2007 as the most overvalued currency in the world (based on the Big Mac Index), has further suffered from the effects of carry trading.|$|E
5|$|Explicit {{goals of}} {{financial}} regulation include countries' pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors. A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, <b>deposit</b> <b>insurance,</b> emergency financing through discount windows, standard accounting practices, and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally.
