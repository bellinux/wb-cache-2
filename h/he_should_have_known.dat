25|$|After an {{adjournment}} {{of three}} weeks, Collingwood presented his summation on 12–16 December 1949. He said that perpetrators {{of war crimes}} could not be absolved of guilt by claiming that they were only following orders when such orders were unlawful under international law. He stated that it was immaterial whether or not Manstein {{was aware of the}} mass killings in his area; <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> and he should have tried {{to put a stop to}} it. He remarked that the testimony of Manstein's fellow soldiers was not corroborated by independent observers, and thus should not be relied upon too heavily. Regarding Manstein's use of the scorched earth tactic, Collingwood pointed out that it was not done out of any military necessity, but had been planned and ordered well in advance. The court adjourned until 19 December to consider the verdict.|$|E
2500|$|White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales {{had issued}} a memo which defined torture very {{narrowly}} as [...] "intentionally causing permanent damage to vital organs or permanent emotional trauma". This would have excluded Graner's acts of intimidation. However the prosecution argued {{that even if}} he was following orders from senior officers, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that the orders were illegal.|$|E
2500|$|Squeezed by the 2008 {{capital markets}} crisis {{and unable to}} raise {{additional}} venture funding, Voy restructured its operations, including lay-offs of staff in the U.S. and Latin America, and put itself up for sale. VOY however did not close transactions [...] with competing buyers and ceased operations. [...] The Deal magazine reported, [...] "Espuelas couldn't have picked a more challenging era in which to launch a media company. The Internet has transformed everything from distribution to consumer behavior. Ironically, Espuelas erred in underestimating the one medium he should have understood best, the Internet. It took a middle-of-the-night epiphany {{to remind him of}} what <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> all along: It's the Internet, stupid.|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Wentworth is {{not very}} gallant by you, Anne, though he was so {{attentive}} to me. Henrietta {{asked him what he}} thought of you, when they went away, and he said, 'You were so altered <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> you again.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Yes. Yes; foolish;--oh, yes! But it {{has been}} only that. There is nothing, nothing that is not known to all the world. The marvel is that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> it. It was in all the newspapers. But he never thinks of trifles such as that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So altered that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> her again!" [...] These were words {{which could}} not but dwell with her. Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them. They were of sobering tendency; they allayed agitation; they composed, and {{consequently}} must make her happier.|$|R
2500|$|Tucker {{was born}} in Alexandria, Virginia on June 18, 1913. His father, Samuel A. Tucker, {{a real estate agent}} and NAACP member, and teacher mother saw to his formal and {{informal}} education. Tucker later said: [...] "I got involved {{in the civil rights movement}} on June 18, 1913, in Alexandria. I was born black." [...] Although Alexandria was less segregated that Richmond and Norfolk, it provided no high school for black children, so after graduating from 8th grade, he had to [...] "bootleg" [...] a high school education across the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. at Armstrong High School. Black Virginia children commuted by streetcar. In June 1927, when Tucker was 14, he, 2 brothers and a friend refused to leave their seats after a streetcar crossed the river into Alexandria, despite the request of a white woman who believed one of the seats was designated only for whites. She swore out a warrant charging them with disorderly conduct and abusive language, and the police levied no fine upon the 11 year old Otto Tucker, but fined Samuel Tucker $5 plus court costs and his older brother George $50 plus court costs, claiming that as eldest <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better. However, on appeal, an all-white jury found the young men not guilty.|$|E
2500|$|On {{that same}} Raw Is War at the First Union Center in Philadelphia, The Rock {{returned}} {{for the first}} time since his kayfabe suspension (in reality, he was given the [...] "suspension" [...] to film The Scorpion King) on the April 2 episode of Raw Is War. Shane, Stephanie, and Vince McMahon were in the ring that night, trying to convince The Rock to join them. Shane reminded The Rock of how Vince screwed him out of the WWF Championship earlier that year at WrestleMania and also in a steel cage match the day after WrestleMania. Vince conceded that it was wrong for him to back Austin, as he was a rattlesnake that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> would eventually bite him. He promised The Rock that he had no intention of screwing him if he returned to the WWF but also noted that he could not promise that he never would; if it was good for business, he said, then he just might do it. He told The Rock that he was at least being honest with him and pleaded for The Rock to trust himself, stating that his future was with the fans and the WWF. The Rock gave Vince a Rock Bottom after some bickering between Shane and Vince, and proceeded to stare down Shane, then smile cheekily and shake Shane's hand, faking a defection to the Alliance and a heel turn – but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well and give him a People's Elbow, before emphatically asserting, [...] "Finally, the Rock has come back... to the WWF," [...] thus aligning himself with the World Wrestling Federation.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then why <b>should</b> <b>he</b> not <b>know?</b> Why <b>should</b> <b>he</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known?</b> Cecilia, {{you will}} tell him to-night {{before he goes}} to his rest?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{next morning}} the Duke asked his guest in a playful tone what was his Christian name. It could hardly be that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> but yet he asked the question. [...] "Francis Oliphant," [...] said Tregear. [...] "Those are two Christian names I suppose, but what do they call you at home?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If he {{were the}} heir <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> it,--though I <b>know</b> nothing of him and believe him to be but a poor {{creature}} and very unfit to have the custody of a family property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly so; on this sacre sea-coast. Is it not {{odd that}} <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that I was here--know the very inn we were at-and know, too, whither I was going to-night?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{see that}} {{anything}} can be done--now--" [...] said Anne, pulling out a nice, cushiony chair for Miss Cornelia. [...] "But {{how in the world}} did Mr. Vickers allow that letter to be printed? Surely <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better." ...|$|E
60|$|Shadow the Weasel was a prisoner. He {{who always}} had been free to go and come as he pleased and to do as he pleased was now in a little narrow cage and quite helpless. For once he had been careless, {{and this was the}} result. Farmer Brown's boy had caught him in a trap. Of course, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better than to have visited the {{henhouse}} a second time after killing three of the best pullets there. <b>He</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that Farmer Brown's boy would be sure to do something about it. The truth is, he had yielded to temptation when common sense had warned him not to. So he had no one to blame for his present difficulty but himself, and he knew it.|$|E
2500|$|... (v) Improperly or dishonestly lent his {{reputation}} to the International Child Development Resource Centre, which promoted to very vulnerable parents expensive products for whose efficacy (as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known)</b> {{there was no}} scientific evidence ...|$|R
60|$|As {{soon as he}} {{was alone}} Stephen opened the bag and drew out an attire such as would be worn by a respectable Peruvian merchant. This he put on, darkened his eyebrows, and stuck on the moustache, and {{acknowledged}} when he viewed himself in a small mirror that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> himself. On his opening the door the girl came in from the other room again.|$|R
50|$|It is {{strongly}} hinted throughout the series that Del Boy and Marlene had an affair, as Del slaps Marlene's bum {{every time he}} sees her, and she usually kisses him hello and goodbye. Every time they do this in public, Boycie provides a warning look to Del, who smiles smugly. Also a running gag involves Del Boy making comments regarding Marlene <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> but would <b>have</b> an explanation when a suspicious Boycie asked him about it.|$|R
6000|$|He {{might have}} known it! If there was any plan that would render his {{position}} more harrowing <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that such {{would be the one}} adopted by the Russian, and what could be more terrible than to leave him to a lifetime of suspense upon an uninhabited island? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; exactly. And <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> {{you better}} than to suppose you would bear it. Then you pressed him, {{and he found himself}} {{compelled}} to send you that stupid newspaper. Of course he had made a mistake. But don't you think that the world goes easier when mistakes are forgiven?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't {{see how the}} Melmottes are to help you. The {{long and}} the short of it is, you oughtn't to be here. It's not often I interfere, but when I heard it I thought I'd come and tell you. I shall write to the governor, and tell him too. <b>He</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better.' ...|$|E
60|$|This second {{young lady}} and Graye were married. That he did not, first or last, love {{his wife as}} <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> done, was <b>known</b> to all; but few knew that his unmanageable heart could never be weaned from useless repining {{at the loss of}} its first idol.|$|R
50|$|Boškoski {{was charged}} with a {{superior}} responsibility for the criminal acts of his subordinates. It is alleged that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> or <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that the crimes had been committed by his subordinates during {{the attack on the}} Albanian village of Ljuboten on 12 August 2001 but did nothing to punish the perpetrators.|$|R
6000|$|... "How <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> otherwise, that Mr. Merriman was Sir Percival's solicitor?" [...] I rejoined. [...] "Besides, when I {{followed}} {{you out of}} the luncheon-room, he told me, {{without a}} single word of inquiry on my part, that something had happened. Depend upon it, he knows more than we do." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known,</b> {{he should}} have guessed, and now she hated him for his {{thoughts}} of her; she who had kept herself untainted {{in the midst of}} the worst corruption that ever infested a Court, whose purity of motives, whose upright judgments had procured her countless enemies amongst the imbecile and the infamous, she to be asked and begged to be loyal and to despise treachery! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had arrived}} that very instant; and, urged by the fearful news that brought him, {{he had come}} {{resolved}} to pluck Wilding from the altar be the ceremony done or not. But in that he reckoned without Mr. Wilding--for <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> him better than to have hoped to succeed. He stepped forward now, and gripped him with his dusty glove by {{the sleeve of his}} shimmering bridegroom's coat. His voice came harsh with excitement and smouldering rage.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{thoughtful}} in Heathcote, {{and like}} his usual kindness, to devise this well-meant caution!" [...] said Ruth, across whose countenance {{a smile so}} radiant passed, that it imparted the expression which is believed to characterize the peculiar benignancy of angels. [...] "Still it was unnecessary; for <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> that we place our strength on the Rock of Ages. Tell me, in what manner hath my precious one borne the exceeding weariness of thy tangled route?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How <b>should</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> it? It <b>has</b> {{only just}} taken place, and they've been so clever, {{for reasons of}} their own--those people move among a lot of {{considerations}} that are absolutely foreign to us--about keeping {{it out of the}} papers. They put in a lot of lies and they leave out the real things." ...|$|R
60|$|And Theodora? Had {{he married}} then, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> never <b>have</b> <b>known</b> Theodora. In this bright saloon, amid the gayety of festive music, and {{surrounded}} by gliding forms of elegance and brilliancy, his heart was full of anguish when he thought of Theodora. To <b>have</b> <b>known</b> such a woman and to have lost her! Why should a man live after this? Yes; he would retire to Muriel, once hallowed by her presence, and he would raise to her memory some monumental fane, beyond the dreams ever of Artemisia, and which should commemorate alike her wondrous life and wondrous mind.|$|R
60|$|His wife he beheld {{now in a}} new light. It was out {{of vanity}} and greed that she had married him, because of the {{position}} in the world that he could give her. Having done so, at least she might have kept faith; she might have been honest, and abided by the bargain. If she had not done so, it was because honesty was beyond her shallow nature. He should have seen before what he now saw so clearly. <b>He</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> her for a lovely, empty husk; a silly, fluttering butterfly; a toy; a thing of vanities, emotions, and nothing else.|$|E
60|$|She {{ran over}} {{a list of}} {{historical}} and distinguished names, and he slyly asked if this and that lady were not dressed so, and so, {{and worked in the}} costumes from her unconsciously elaborate answers; she was afterwards astonished that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> what people had on. Lastly, he asked what the committee expected to do next, and was enabled to enrich his report with many authoritative expressions and intimations. The lady became all zeal in these confidences to the public, at last; she told everything she knew, and a great deal that she merely hoped.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Lucy, I {{know what}} you are thinking: another holiday over, and we are no nearer to the truth. I own that our plan has failed so far, for I can't see in either of the boys a shadow of {{resemblance}} either to you or myself. Some people profess to see likenesses. Mr. Tomline remarked yesterday that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> Rupert anywhere as my son, but then Colonel Wilson said the day before that Edgar had got just your expression. I don't see a scrap of likeness either way, and I begin to think, dear, that I don't want to see it." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: One of {{the most}} {{striking}} examples of near-death experience stories is the account of a clinically dead patient whose dentures were removed from his mouth prior to resuscitation, and which dentures were then lost. Days later the patient saw a nurse and told him that it was he who had removed those dentures. The patient was right, but <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not <b>have</b> <b>known</b> this information, because tat the time the nurse had removed his dentures, the patient was clinically dead. Since publication of this account in a prestigious mainstream medical journal, speculations have abounded. In this article I describe the investigation I undertook to put these speculations to rest and the outcome of that investigation...|$|R
50|$|He courted her for twenty-eight days, confiding {{that he had}} {{experienced}} major disappointments when his roles in the Otsu incident and the Cretan governorship were misconstrued and under-appreciated by both individuals and governments who <b>he</b> felt <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>known</b> better. <b>He</b> also admitted that, contrary to what he knew were her hopes, he could not commit to living in France permanently since he had to remain prepared to undertake royal duties in Greece or Crete if summoned to do so. Once his proposal of marriage was tentatively accepted, the bride's father was astonished when George waived any contractual clause guaranteeing an allowance or inheritance from Marie; she would retain and manage her own fortune (a trust yielding 800,000 francs per annum) and only their future children would receive legacies.|$|R
