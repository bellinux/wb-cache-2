500|$|The Supreme Court again {{upheld the}} preclearance {{requirement}} in City of Rome v. United States (1980). The Court held that because Congress had explicit constitutional power {{to enforce the}} Reconstruction Amendments [...] "by appropriate legislation", the Act did not violate principles of federalism. The Court also explicitly upheld the [...] "discriminatory effect" [...] prong of Section 5, stating {{that even though the}} Fifteenth Amendment directly prohibited only <b>intentional</b> <b>discrimination,</b> Congress could constitutionally prohibit unintentional discrimination to mitigate the risk that jurisdictions may engage in <b>intentional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Finally, the Court upheld the 1975 extension of Section 5 because of the record of discrimination that continued to persist in the covered jurisdictions. The Court further suggested that the temporary nature of the special provisions was relevant to Section 5's constitutionality.|$|E
40|$|Rules {{of civil}} {{procedure}} have been examined extensively for their intended and unintended effects on case outcomes. Little attention, however, {{has been given to}} Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 (a) (Rule 52 (a)) -its clear error standard of review-and how appellate courts apply or avoid it when examining substantive legal doctrine. Specifically, when confronted with cases involving actual malice and <b>intentional</b> race <b>discrimination</b> determinations, courts take markedly different approaches. While demanding a full reevaluation of facts in the actual malice context, appellate courts invariably apply the far more deferential clear error standard to a trial court 2 ̆ 7 s factual findings regarding <b>intentional</b> race <b>discrimination.</b> This inconsistent approach between <b>intentional</b> race <b>discrimination</b> and actual malice findings is neither doctrinally sound nor institutionally defensible...|$|R

500|$|Section 3(c) {{contains}} a [...] "bail-in" [...] or [...] "pocket trigger" [...] {{process by which}} jurisdictions that fall outside the coverage formula of Section 4(b) may become subject to preclearance. Under this provision, if a jurisdiction has racially discriminated against voters {{in violation of the}} Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments, a court may order the jurisdiction to have future changes to its election laws preapproved by the federal government. Because courts have interpreted the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to prohibit only <b>intentional</b> <b>discrimination,</b> a court may bail in a jurisdiction only if the plaintiff proves that the jurisdiction enacted or operated a voting practice to purposely discriminate.|$|E

2500|$|The Court {{then turned}} to the {{question}} that was at issue in the case: whether the disparate-impact regulation that Sandoval invoked created an implied private right of action. The Court rejected the argument, put forward both by Sandoval and by Justice Stevens's dissenting opinion, that because Cannon involved disparate impact, Cannon held that Title IX and, by extension Title VI, create a private right of action to enjoin policies that create a disparate impact. Both Sandoval and Justice Stevens relied on a footnote in Cannon, which stated that the effect of the policies that the Cannon plaintiff challenged was [...] "to exclude women from consideration." [...] The Court responded that Cannon was decided {{on the assumption that the}} University of Chicago had engaged in <b>intentional</b> <b>discrimination,</b> and hence the holding of case applied only to <b>intentional</b> <b>discrimination.</b> The Court asserted that [...] "this Court is bound by holdings, not language."

5|$|The {{rational}} nexus test {{does not}} apply where a statute treats all persons equally, but it is alleged that the authorities have applied the statute in a discriminatory manner.

Such a nexus will be absent if the action amounts to <b>intentional</b> and arbitrary <b>discrimination</b> or <b>intentional</b> systematic <b>discrimination.</b> It is insufficient if any inequality is due to inadvertence or inefficiency, unless this occurs on a very substantial scale.

50|$|As {{early as}} 1866, the Civil Rights Act {{provided}} {{a remedy for}} <b>intentional</b> race <b>discrimination</b> in employment by private employers {{and state and local}} public employers. The Civil Rights Act of 1871 applies to public employment or employment involving state action prohibiting deprivation of rights secured by the federal constitution or federal laws through action under color of law. Title VII is the principal federal statute with regard to employment discrimination prohibiting unlawful employment discrimination by public and private employers, labor organizations, training programs and employment agencies based on race or color, religion, gender, and national origin. Title VII also prohibits retaliation against any person for opposing any practice forbidden by statute, or for making a charge, testifying, assisting, or participating in a proceeding under the statute. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the damages available in Title VII cases and granted Title VII plaintiffs the right to a jury trial. Title VII also provides that race and color discrimination against every race and color is prohibited.|$|R

40|$|Congress {{declared}} {{the enactment of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1991 a victory for women and civil rights advocates.

So, Congress said, the Civil Rights Act was a victory because white women who sued under Title VII could finally recover damages. But the 2 ̆ 2 victory 2 ̆ 2 was only partial. The Civil Rights Act capped a victim 2 ̆ 7 s recovery to a maximum of 300, 000 in combined compensatory and punitive damages, a stark contrast to the unlimited compensatory and punitive damages available to black women who sued under 42 U.

5000|$|In 1972 women's {{sports in}} the United States got a boost when the Congress passed the Title IX {{legislation}} {{as a part of}} the additional Amendment Act to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Title IX states that: [...] "no person shall on the basis of sex, be excluded from participating in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance..."; in other words, Title IX prohibits gender discrimination in schools that receive federal funds through grants, scholarships, or other support for students. The law states that federal funds can be withdrawn from a school engaging in <b>intentional</b> gender <b>discrimination</b> in the provision of curriculum, counseling, academic support, or general educational opportunities; this includes interscholastic or varsity sports. This law from the Education Act requires that both male and female athletes have equal facilities and equal benefits. The equal benefits are the necessities such as equal equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality in coaches and opponents, awards, cheerleaders and bands at the game. In practice, the difficulty with Title IX is making sure schools are compliant with the law. In 1979, there was a policy interpretation that offered three ways in which schools could be compliant with Title IX; it became known as the [...] "three-part test".|$|R
