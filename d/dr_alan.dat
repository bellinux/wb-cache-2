25|$|Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) {{is a rare}} but serious {{disease that}} is limited to show Border Collies.

25|$|Trapped Neutrophil Syndrome (TNS) is a {{hereditary}} disease {{in which the}} bone marrow produces neutrophils (white cells) but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream.

This indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself. TNS was identified by Jeremy Shearman in the laboratory of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Alan</b> Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales.

EUCC was invited by the European Commission to join the EU ICZM Expert Group; <b>Dr.</b> <b>Alan</b> Pickaver was EUCC’s representative in this expert group until August 2013.
