25|$|The Runaways are hunted {{by several}} {{remaining}} Majesdanian soldiers {{with the desire}} to capture Karolina for the problems caused on their planet; in a twisted turn of events, however, Xavin shape-shifts into Karolina and leaves with the Majesdanians. The Runaways also prevent a zombie epidemic in Los Angeles. Molly also visits the X-Men in San Francisco and reconciles with Wolverine. The team is attacked while staying in Chase's parent's beach house. Old Lace is critically wounded saving Klara, who's powers cause foliage to keep the house from crumbling, but trapping <b>everybody.</b> <b>A</b> man alleging to be Chase's uncle appears and tries to help, but is followed by the military. The team runs away, but Chase separates and is critically wounded in a car accident while running across the street chasing a figure reminiscent to Gertrude.|$|E
500|$|On June 15, 1953, Houtteman {{was traded}} by the Tigers, along with Owen Friend, Joe Ginsberg and Bill Wight, to the Cleveland Indians for Ray Boone, Al Aber, Steve Gromek and Dick Weik. In July 1953, he {{returned}} to Detroit to pitch against the Tigers. At the time, Houtteman admitted {{he wanted to be}} traded. [...] He said, [...] "The fans are down on me and I'd do <b>everybody</b> <b>a</b> lot more good by being traded". He was not content with the Tigers and said there were times when it seemed he [...] "couldn't wait to peel off his uniform after a game". As a result of Indians' pitching coach Mel Harder doing a [...] "complete" [...] overhaul, Houtteman was moved into the starting rotation, to replace Bob Feller. Houtteman finished the season in Cleveland with a 7–7 record, six complete games, one shutout, 109 innings pitched, and a 3.80 ERA.|$|E

500|$|Orr is {{also well}} known for his {{charitable}} works, although he kept mention of {{them out of the}} press. Former Eagle-Tribune writer Russ Conway noted of one occasion when Orr and Conway visited Boston Children's Hospital, with a box of programs, pennants, pucks, pictures and Boston memorabilia: [...] "We went from room to room, Orr popping in, unannounced to visit the kids. Some couldn't believe their eyes; sick as they were, they laughed in astonishment and delight. Bobby Orr! He talked and joked with every one of them, asking names, rubbing heads, giving <b>everybody</b> <b>a</b> little present from the box, leaving a stick, autographing everything in sight." [...] Orr made Conway promise to not print a word in the newspaper. Orr was involved in numerous charity fund raisers. In 1980, Orr was awarded the Multiple Sclerosis Silver Hope Chest Award by the Multiple Sclerosis Society for his [...] "numerous and unselfish contributions to society".|$|E
500|$|Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush also commended [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] and its musical style, saying [...] "The song is {{infused with}} the tropical, island groove {{that she has}} {{explored}} on 'Loud' and which harks back to her upbringing in Barbados." [...] Sciarretto also noted that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] would be very popular in bars and clubs because of the lyrical content. Andy Gill of The Independent called the song an anthem with which the weekend can start. Thomas Conner of the Chicago Sun-Times said that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] is the best song on the album, saying [...] " [...] a wise, world-weary paean from a gal at the bar who's seen some stuff, has moved on and wants to buy <b>everybody</b> <b>a</b> round of fruity shots." [...] However, Chris Richards of The Washington Post stated that [...] "Cheers (Drink to That)" [...] did not meet his expectations and commented that the song is a lowlight in Rihanna's career, stating [...] "'Turn it around with another round,' Rihanna bellows over the mid slog, as if setting ad copy to music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Biographer Zobnin doubts {{the fact}} that Merezhkovsky {{has been on the}} German radio at all, noting that none of the memoirists who {{mentioned}} it, have themselves heard Merezhkovsky speaking on air. All of those 'witnesses' were invariably referring to the printed version of the [...] "speech" [...] published in 1944 by Parizhsky Vestnik. This document, according to Zobnin (the author of the first [...] comprehensive Merezhkovsky biography published in Russia) was most certainly a montage fake, concocted by the Nazi propaganda out of the 1939 unpublished essay The Mystery of the Russian Revolution (on Dostoyevsky's Demons novel), bits and pieces thrown in. The researcher insists such speech could not have been broadcast in the late June: the couple resided in Biarritz and for an elderly person to give <b>everybody</b> <b>a</b> slip and somehow get to Paris was hardly probable.|$|E

2500|$|According to Cristina Odone in The Observer, Dacre has a {{reputation}} towards underlings of [...] "verbal abuse [...] a drill sergeant's delight in public humiliation" [...] which also includes verbal abuse. Nick Davies, in his book Flat Earth News (2008), writes that Dacre's staff call his morning editorial meetings the [...] "Vagina Monologues" [...] because of his habit of calling <b>everybody</b> <b>a</b> [...] "cunt". In his Desert Island Discs appearance in 2004, host Sue Lawley quizzed him on his methods, to which Dacre responded: [...] "Shouting creates energy, energy creates great headlines." [...] Conrad Black, a convicted fraudster and ex-proprietor of the Telegraph papers, considers him [...] "a saturnine and capricious manipulator". Peter Wilby, in a December 2013 profile for the New Statesman, quoted an anonymous source, who said of Dacre: [...] "He’s no longer the expletive volcano he once was; his barbs these days tend to concern the brainpower of his target and their supposed laziness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although workers {{compensation}} laws deny workers {{the right}} to sue their employer, it is possible for them to sue a related third party. Within a week of the explosion Williams Bailey, a law firm based in Houston, Texas, placed half-page advertisements in a local newspaper. The adverts read [...] "Were you seriously injured in last week's explosion?", and directed potential clients to the company website. The advert also claims that the firm has extensive experience in explosion-related cases. Fran Deisinger, director of the Milwaukee Bar Association, said of the ad [...] "It's a little disconcerting because it's such a terrible situation here that I think it probably rubs <b>everybody</b> <b>a</b> little wrong,", adding that although he believed the ad to be in poor taste, it didn't breach any rules for lawyer advertising. Although it is unclear whether any workers contacted Williams Bailey, it is known that at least one injured man, and the families of the deceased, have hired personal injury lawyer Bob Habush to represent them, who once before worked on a high-profile industrial case when three people {{died as a result of}} a crane collapse in 1991. On February 7, 2007, he launched a suit against Brennan based on these allegations. J.M. Brennan responded with the following statement: [...] "We are proud of our employees and the response they took in response to the explosion. And we're confident that the results of the official investigation will show that J.M. Brennan's work was reasonable and did not contribute to the cause of the explosion." [...] The suit was settled out of court.|$|E
