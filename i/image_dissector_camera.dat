In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma ("Pem") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).|$|E

2500|$|On September 7, 1927, Farnsworth's <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> <b>camera</b> tube {{transmitted}} {{its first}} image, a simple straight line, to a receiver {{in another room}} of his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. Pem Farnsworth recalled in 1985 that her husband broke the stunned silence of his lab assistants by saying, [...] "There you are — electronic television!" [...] The source of the image was a glass slide, backlit by an arc lamp. An extremely bright source was required because of the low light sensitivity of the design. By 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. His backers had demanded to know when they would see dollars from the invention; so the first image shown was, appropriately, a dollar sign.

25|$|After sailing to Europe in 1934, Farnsworth secured an {{agreement}} with Goerz-Bosch-Fernseh in Germany. Some <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> <b>cameras</b> were used to broadcast the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin.|$|R
50|$|The {{two systems}} were {{to run on}} a trial basis for six months; early {{television}} sets supported both resolutions. However, the Baird system, which used a mechanical camera for filmed programming and Farnsworth <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> <b>cameras</b> for live programming, proved too cumbersome and visually inferior, and ended with closedown (at 22:00) on Saturday 13 February 1937.|$|R

40|$|A unified {{approach}} to computer vision and manipulation is developed {{which is called}} choreographic vision. In the model, objects to be viewed by a projected robot in the Viking missions to Mars are seen as objects to be manipulated within choreographic contexts controlled by a multimoded remote, supervisory control system on Earth. A new theory of context relations is introduced {{as a basis for}} choreographic programming languages. A topological vision model is developed for recognizing objects by shape and contour. This model is integrated with a projected vision system consisting of a multiaperture <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> TV <b>camera</b> and a ranging laser system. System program specifications integrate eye-hand coordination and topological vision functions and an aerospace multiprocessor implementation is described...|$|R
5000|$|An <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> is a <b>camera</b> {{tube that}} creates an [...] "electron image" [...] {{of a scene}} from {{photocathode}} emissions (electrons) which pass through a scanning aperture to an anode, which serves as an electron detector. Among the first to design such a device were German inventors Max Dieckmann and Rudolf Hell, who had titled their 1925 patent application Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric <b>Image</b> <b>Dissector</b> Tube for Television). The term may apply specifically to a dissector tube employing magnetic fields to keep the electron image in focus, an element lacking in Dieckmann and Hell's design, {{and in the early}} dissector tubes built by American inventor Philo Farnsworth.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} is to localize celestial sources of X-rays to a precision of 5 to 20 arcsec, {{so that they may}} be identified with optical or radio counterparts. We also study their angular size and structure, to elucidate the X-ray emission mechanism. Four grids, wound with nickel alloy wires, are aligned to produce a modulated X-ray signal when the spacecraft rotation carries the collimator field of view across an X-ray source. An <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> star <b>camera</b> and rate integrating gyroscopes are used to deduce the celestial position from which a peak X-ray signal arises. On-orbit performance and thermal stability have been very good. Based on the first six weeks of quick look data, we have the following results: the location of an X-ray burst source within a globular cluster; the location of 4 U 1608 - 52, a unique object which shows bursting, transient, and steady X-ray behavior and is also an optical source; the location of the X-ray transient H 1705 - 25, which provided Anglo-Australian astronomers the basis for an optical identification with a nova-like object; the location of the X-ray transient H 1743 - 32 in the galactic center; and a precise measurement of the angular extent of the Crab Nebula...|$|R
50|$|Because only {{a limited}} number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain {{diameter}} became impractical, image resolution on mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to 120 or so. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear. A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that Peck Television Corp. started in 1935 at station VE9AK in Montreal. The advancement of all-electronic television (including <b>image</b> <b>dissectors</b> and other <b>camera</b> tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for adding {{a form of}} buffer store to an <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> is described that increases markedly the photoelectron-detecting ability of the <b>image</b> <b>dissector.</b> The buffer-store function is accomplished in the phosphor screen of an image intensifier tube by the metastable electronic excitation states resulting in the phosphor screen from high-energy photoelectron bombardment. The addition of this image intensifier to an <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> is shown to cause no nonlinearity in the input/output characteristics of the <b>image</b> <b>dissector...</b>|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} an electronic heterodyne recording which uses electrooptic modulation {{to introduce a}} sinusoidal phase shift between the object and reference wave. The resulting temporally modulated holographic interference pattern is scanned by a commercial <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> <b>camera,</b> and {{the rejection of the}} self-interference terms is accomplished by heterodyne detection at the camera output. The electrical signal representing this processed hologram can then be used to modify the properties of a liquid crystal light valve or a similar device.

40|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of an <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> coupled to an echelle grating spectrometer for simulta-neous multielement determinations by atomic absorption are presented here. Because the <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> and echelle grating spectrometer are not {{commonly used in}} clinical practice, the basic concepts and characteristics of these components are discussed. A comparison with a silicon target vidicon suggests that the <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> has a luminous sensitivity that is 130 to 190 times {{greater than that of}} the vidicon. Multielement detection limits for Cu, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni with the image dissector/echelle spectrometer are lower than with the silicon vidicon by a factor ranging from four to 27, and are comparable to, or better than, single-element detection limits reported for a silicon vidicon and conventional optics.

40|$|An {{electronic}} {{heterodyne technique}} {{is being investigated}} for video (i. e., television rate and format) recording of interference patterns. In the heterodyne technique electro-optic modulation is used to introduce a sinusoidal phase shift between the beams of an interferometer. For phase modulation frequencies between 0. 1 and 15 MHz an <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> <b>camera</b> {{may be used to}} scan the resulting temporally modulated interference pattern. Heterodyne detection of the camera output is used to selectively record the interference pattern. An advantage of such synchronous recording is that it permits recording of low-contrast fringes in high ambient light conditions. The application of this technique to the recording of holograms is discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensor system}} which {{provides}} registered high-solution multispectral images {{from a single}} sensor with no mechanical moving parts is reported, and the operation of an <b>image</b> <b>dissector</b> <b>camera</b> (IDC) is described. An earth scene 100 nautical miles wide is imaged through a single lens onto a photocathode surface containing three spectral filters, thereby producing three separate spectral signatures on the photocathode surface. An electron image is formed, accelerated, focused, and electromagnetically, deflected across an image plane which contains three sampling apertures, behind which are located three electron multipliers. The IDC system uses electromagnetic deflection for cross-track scanning and spacecraft orbit motion for along-track scanning, thus {{eliminating the need for}} a mechanical scanning mirror...|$|E

A close relationship is generally observed between centers of high ozone and vortices in the IDCS and THIR montages. This is also confirmed by low centers in the 200 mb Northern Hemisphere charts. The vertical distribution of ozone indicates that the enhancement in ozone in these cases occurs in the lower stratosphere (and possibly to a minor extent in the troposphere) {{rather than in the}} upper stratosphere and mesosphere...|$|E
