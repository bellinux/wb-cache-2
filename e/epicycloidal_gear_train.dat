40|$|Abstract. Planetary <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> are {{commonly}} used in various transmissions due to the following reasons: compact size, light weight, and multi-degrees of freedom. For example, planetary <b>gear</b> <b>trains</b> can be designed for following functions: gear reducers for power machinery, internal gear hubs for bicycle, gear increasers for wind generator, gear reducers for robot. In general, the reduction of non-coupled planetary <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> is less than 10. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce the planetary <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> with high reduction ratio. Coupled planetary <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> can be designed to has high reduction ratio. Hence, this paper focuses on innovative, kinematic, and engineering design of coupled planetary <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> with high reduction ratio. The coupled planetary <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> synthesized in this paper is a planetary <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> with simple planet gears. It can be used as the gear reducer for a robot. Refer to the train value equation, the reduction-ratio equation of coupled planetary <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> is derived for the design purpose. Then, the coupled planetary coupled <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> with simple planet gears is synthesized based on the above reduction-ratio equation.

The modeling and simulation of spur gears in portal axle is important to predict the actual motion behavior. However, <b>gear</b> <b>train</b> design in portal axle is difficult to study comprehensively due to their relatively low cost and short product life cycle. In this study, modal analysis of portal axle is simulated using finite element method (FEM).
