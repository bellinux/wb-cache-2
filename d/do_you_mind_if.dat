6000|$|... "I will {{go round}} to Highclose," [...] said Lettie. [...] "I am {{sure it will}} be stormy again. Are you coming down the road, Miss Slaighter, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> I leave you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We sold 'em off, when we parted {{with the}} farm. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> I have another cigarette? That was when I {{was quite a}} little chap, you know, that we had this ostrich farm." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't be foolish," [...] she laughed. [...] "I decline {{absolutely}} {{to believe}} that you had a single thought of me when you turned in here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> I say that I prefer not to believe it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not up to much,' he said. 'Look here, Grey, I've got {{rather an}} idea. It's my opinion Payne's not bucking up {{nearly as much}} as he might. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mind</b> <b>if</b> I leave him out of the next game?' ...|$|E
