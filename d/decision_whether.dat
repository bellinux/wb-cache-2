5|$|In 2001, AOL {{merged with}} Time Warner to form AOL Time Warner. Time Warner's {{market share of}} the music {{industry}} had dropped almost five percent from the mid-1990s, and the new executives ordered the termination of 600 jobs. One of those jobs was Reprise Records president Howie Klein, who had been a big supporter of Wilco on the label. Klein's dismissal placed head A representative David Kahne in charge of the <b>decision</b> <b>whether</b> to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.|$|E
5|$|In {{people with}} {{suspected}} ketosis-prone type 2 diabetes, determination of antibodies against {{glutamic acid decarboxylase}} and islet cells may aid in the <b>decision</b> <b>whether</b> to continue insulin administration long-term (if antibodies are detected), or whether to withdraw insulin and attempt treatment with oral medication as in type 2 diabetes. Generally speaking, routine measurement of C-peptide {{as a measure of}} insulin production is not recommended unless there is genuine doubt as to whether someone has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.|$|E
5|$|The band {{managed to}} persuade fellow student Caleb Bradley to manage them, {{and by the}} start of 1968, the band had managed to record a demo tape {{influenced}} by blues and jazz, sending it to Lou Reizner, then the U.K. head of Mercury Records, who offered the trio of Hammill, Smith, and Pearne a recording contract in May. At this point, the band had to make a <b>decision</b> <b>whether</b> to stay on at university, or quit their courses and move to London to turn professional.

5|$|The <b>decision</b> <b>whether</b> {{to proceed}} with Zeus {{eventually}} fell to President John F. Kennedy, who became fascinated by the indecision surrounding the ABM system. In 1963, the United States Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, convinced Kennedy to cancel Zeus. McNamara directed its funding towards studies of new ABM concepts being considered by ARPA, selecting the Nike-X concept which addressed Zeus' various problems by using an extremely high-speed missile, Sprint, along with greatly improved radars and computer systems. The Zeus test site built at Kwajalein was briefly used as an anti-satellite weapon.|$|E

25|$|In cricket the toss {{is often}} significant, as the <b>decision</b> <b>whether</b> to bat or bowl first can {{influence}} {{the outcome of the}} game.

25|$|The card {{allowed a}} {{two-dimensional}} pricing schedule, {{which consists of}} card price (a fixed cost), and ticket price (a variable cost). Once a passenger has bought a card, its price becomes a sunk cost and this makes the train more like the automobile, which is also characterised by high fixed costs. The <b>decision</b> <b>whether</b> to take a car or train for a particular journey depends mostly on the marginal price per kilometer, not on the total cost.|$|E

This group maintains six alphabetic lists of names, with one list used each year. This normally results in each name being reused every six years. However, {{in the case of}} a particularly deadly or damaging storm, that storm's name is retired, and a replacement starting with the same letter is selected to take its place. The <b>decision</b> <b>whether</b> to remove a name is made yearly at an annual session of the Hurricane Committee.|$|E

The proportion of a deposit that is economically recoverable is dependent on the enrichment factor of the ore in the area.|$|E
