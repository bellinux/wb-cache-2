Rigorous thermodynamic models for various groups of volatile compounds have been incorporated into the database of the Murdoch Bayer liquor model to simulate their distribution among different process streams. Under conditions prevailing in a high-temperature digestion stage of the Bayer process, only hydrogen, low hydrocarbons, and mercury are predicted to be present in the gas phase in significant amounts. The other volatiles primarily remain dissolved in the liquor and are therefore transported to the <b>flash</b> <b>vessels.</b> <b>Flash</b> train simulations confirm that hydrophobic substances accumulate in the vapor phase where they can be destroyed by thermal oxidation. However, large fractions of hydrophilic substances are predicted to dissolve in the aqueous phases.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{described}} in this paper was to trace and eliminate vibration sources in a low pressure system with high flow velocities. Considerable vibration on the pipe system between a <b>flashing</b> <b>vessel</b> (6. 5 m diameter) and heat-exchangers resulted in fatigue failure, leakage and subsequent shut down of a chemical production plant. As compressors or pumps were not {{directly involved in the}} process, we considered aero-acoustic pulsations as the main cause of the high vibration levels. Analysis of the flow in the pipe system showed that mean flow velocities could rise up to 50 m/s, which is rather high considering the speed of sound in the gas of 195 ms/s. Furthermore separation of the flow from the pipe wall occurs at the outlets of a <b>flashing</b> <b>vessel,</b> which resulted in estimated flow velocities of over 100 m/s in the vena contracta. This paper provides an overview of the analysis done by a onedimensional acoustical model and scale modeling of part of the piping. The recommended modification consists of a perforated pipe section between the outlets of the vessel and has been tested in a scale model. Tests have been performed with airflow at identical Mach numbers for different configurations with perforation ratios form 70 to 36 %. The modification with a perforation ratio of 70 % shows a reduction of a factor 5 of the pressure pulsation and vibration levels over the entire frequency range. The net pressure loss for this configuration is similar to that in the original lay-out without the perforated tube. This modification was implemented during a plant shutdown and proved to be very effective. The results are well in line with the predicted levels and {{on the basis of this}} success a similar design has been planned for two new installations. © TNO Science & Industry 2008...|$|R

The projects at Brawley and Salton Sea are substantially different from that at Heber in objective, size and design. The reasons for these differences {{are related to the}} different nature of the geothermal brines and to different operating philosophies of the resource developers involved. The projects at Brawley and Salton Sea include the construction and operation by Edison of 10 MW (gross) units.

It is, therefore, the developer's responsibility to drill and complete the geothermal production and injection wells, and to construct and operate the steam separators and <b>flash</b> <b>vessels,</b> brine processing equipment, injection pumps, and steam scrubbing equipment. These units are 10 MW rather than 50 to 100 MW due to the technical risks associated with producing, handling and injecting the very high salinity brines at these locations. In addition, the reliability of turbine operation with relatively impure steam is a major concern. The Heber plant, on the other hand, will utilize a much cleaner resource. The technical risk is, therefore, judged to be substantially lower. The plant at Heber will be a commercial 45 MW unit.

40|$|This project {{explores the}} plant-scale process design and {{economic}} viability of production of ethylene glycol using a patented direct route from cellulose. Switchgrass {{was selected as}} the source of cellulose because it is a low-cost, non-feedstock plant capable of growing under a variety of conditions. The plant is designed to produce 100 million pounds of 99. 5 % pure ethylene glycol which is the required purity for ethylene glycol used in plastic bottle production. The project is environmentally friendly and meets the Federal and state emission regulations. The process design consists of three major components: pre-treatment, reaction and separation. In the pre-treatment stage, the switchgrass is ground and cellulose is extracted using highly dilute base. The reaction occurs in water solvent under 5 MPa of hydrogen in a fixed bed catalytic reactor with a retention time of 30 minutes. The ethylene glycol product is separated from the solvent and byproducts by <b>flash</b> <b>vessels</b> and column distillation in order to attain 99. 5 % purity. A side product, propylene glycol, is also produced at 99. 5 % purity and is separated in a similar fashion. For the economic analysis, the plant was assumed to be located in Tennessee (near the Gulf Coast) where switchgrass is readily available. The total capital investment is $ 349, 000, 000, including a working capital of $ 7, 747, 000. The process is sensitive to the amount of solvent used. In the base case scenario using the same amount of solvent as used in the patent with ethylene glycol priced at $ 0. 50 /lb, propylene glycol byproduct priced at $ 0. 78 /lb, switchgrass priced at $ 50 /dry ton, hydrogen priced at $ 1. 00 /lb, and catalyst priced at $ 5. 08 /lb, the net present value (NPV) of the project is negative $ 565, 500, 000 based on an interest rate of 15 %, and the investor’s rate of return (IRR) is negative.

Recently, several commercial simulators have been developed, including HYSYS, which was initially developed for applications related to petrochemicals, but with modifications can be used to simulate the operating conditions of other areas such as the food industry. The evaporation of orange juice is a processing step that aims to concentrate the separation of water by heating the mixture, with high energy consumption. Therefore, processes modeling and simulation using simulators such as HYSYS becomes very attractive due to the possibility of studies in the plant without the need of experimentation, since the process being modeled it is possible to obtain fast and reliable information. The results of this study showed that hypothetical orange juice modeled in HYSYS through the sucrose solution in water represented well and the real juice obtaining a deviation less than 10 % for the property thermal conductivity.

40|$|Due to {{the fact}} that CFC (Chloro-Fluoro-Carbon) fluids will be {{forbidden}} as working fluids in heat pumps for environmental reasons, there is an urgent need for alternatives. As one alternative type of fluid, non-azeotropic mixtures have been suggested. This thesis deals with such mixtures. It includes mixtures with HCFC components, in spite of the recently imposed international restrictions for these fluids too, since this work started well before those restrictions and since good data exist for such mixtures. The main aim of the thesis work has been to improve our knowledge about mixture behaviour in heat pump systems, with emphasis on thermodynamic differences between mixtures and pure fluids. A comprehensive computer program for simulation of heat pump systems with mixtures has been developed and utilized in several theoretical investigations. Furthermore, an experimental project in a full-scale plant with a non-azeotropic mixture has been carried out. A study of different methods for comparison between mixtures and pure fluids in terms of calculated performance of a heat pump has been done. It showed that traditional methods for pure fluids can easily yield misleading results when used for mixtures. Reliable results are achieved if the comparisons are made rigorously, with the same heat exchanger area, and transport properties are included properly. By means of the computer program, non-azeotropic mixture alternatives to CFC 12 and CFC 114 have been investigated. It was found that mixtures with moderate internal glides (less than approximately 10 K) in many cases can compete with pure fluids in terms of COP, even at small external temperature glides. Mixture behaviour in two-stage cycles has been investigated in detail theoretically. Thermodynamic differences between a two-stage cycle with <b>flash</b> <b>vessel</b> and one with economizer heat exchanger, both charged with the same non-azeotropic mixture, are explained. It is quantified how the differences influence the heat pump performance. For the heat exchanger type, mixtures gain more in COP when going from a one-stage to a two-stage cycle than a pure fluid does while, for cycles with a <b>flash</b> <b>vessel,</b> this benefit does not exist. By means of a sensitivity analysis the required accuracy levels of key factors for making performance predictions within a given uncertainty range have been identified. In order to enhance the prediction accuracy it is of greatest interest to increase our knowledge about the heat transfer coefficient at evaporation and the isentropic efficiency of the compressor. No major differences between mixtures and pure fluids were found regarding sensitivities to the investigated factors involved in estimations of heat pump performance. An experimental comparison between two 1 MW heat pumps was carried out. One was charged with a non-azeotropic mixture of HCFC 22 -HCFC 142 b and the other with pure CFC 12. Variations in capacity and COP were determined. In spite of unfavourable external conditions for the mixture, comparable COPs and capacities for the two heat pumps were found at equal external conditions.

The process consists of three interconnected units, as follows: fermentor, cell retention system (tangential microfiltration) and vacuum <b>flash</b> <b>vessel</b> (responsible for the continuous recovery of butanol from the broth). The dynamic behaviour of the process is described by a non-linear mathematical model with kinetic parameters determined experimentally, whose non-linearity makes the solution of the optimisation problem difficult through conventional algorithms, thus justifying the use of an evolutionary method based on the GAs. The objective of the optimisation was the search of the process inputs that maximises the productivity of butanol for a desired substrate conversion. The potential of binary and real coded genetic algorithms to solve the optimisation problem was assessed. The GA parameters were evaluated making use of the statistical technique of the factorial design in order to identify the most significant ones to the GAs response and to determine the values of the parameters that improve the GAs performance. With both GA codes similar solutions to the optimisation problem were obtained. However, in relation to computational time, the binary code outperformed the real code. The optimised process ran on concentrated sugar solution (140. 7 g/l), reaching a high final butanol concentration (27. 1 g/l) and high butanol productivity (9. 0 g/l. h).

The subsurface system is modeled using the reservoir simulator TOUGH 2 while using the graphical interface PetraSim for visualization. Additionally, an in-house wellbore model is used to accurately reflect the temperature and pressure changes {{that occur in the}} wellbore fluids and the surrounding casing, cement, and earth during injection and production. The conditions present at the Newberry, Oregon EGS project site are the basis for this optimization. The subsurface conditions are favorable for the production of electricity from geothermal energy with rock temperatures exceeding 300 °C at a well depth of 3 km. This research was completed in collaboration with AltaRock Energy, which has provided our research group with data from the Newberry well. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to determine the optimal conditions for operating an enhanced geothermal system for the production of electricity at Newberry. For the modeling of the subsurface system, several reservoir fracture designs were investigated. As anticipated, it was determined that an EGS with the largest fracture network yields the best production temperatures with respect to time for a constant production flow rate. This allows for better mass flow rate distribution throughout the reservoir resulting in minimal temperature depletion of the engineered reservoir. For the conditions present at Newberry, a double-flash steam power plant for the generation of electricity was determined to be the optimal surface plant design.

40|$|We {{present a}} process for the {{production}} of isoprene via the fermentation of glucose. Based on our current specifications, we conclude that the use of recombinant E. coli for the fermentation of glucose is a novel yet unprofitable venture. Our current design entails the continuous production of isoprene using 3 pre-seed, 3 seed, and 5 production fermenters each with a production fermentation time of 72 hours. Our scheduling of the fermenters allowed us to produce isoprene continuously at a steady rate, and the liquid by-products of the fermentation were removed and sterilized {{at the end of each}} batch. Isoprene was mainly present in the vapor phase during the fermentation and was purified using a combination of an absorption using ISOPAR v, stripping with steam, and separation using a <b>flash</b> <b>vessel.</b> It was desired that the fermentation was operated near the minimum oxygen concentration (MOC) as such conditions allowed for the highest production rate of isoprene based on the preliminary studies done by Chotani in their patent. The fermentation was operated at 34 °C and 1. 7 bar with glucose and oxygen as the reactants producing isoprene, carbon dioxide, and water as the products. The results of our design suggest that the price of isoprene is too low when compared to the costs of raw materials, making this process economically unfeasible under present market conditions. We project that $ 4. 08 worth of glucose will be need for each pound of isoprene which currently goes for $ 0. 79 /lb. Additionally, the metabolic pathway of isoprene is highly exothermic, requiring large utility requirements in terms of chilled water to remove heat from the fermenters. We are unsure of impacts of rapidly changing the temperature of E. Coli on production as there is no data regarding the robustness of the strain.

40|$|Concentrated {{sulfuric acid}} {{is used as}} a {{homogenous}} catalyst in the alkylation process. Due to side reactions the acid becomes diluted and must be removed from the process as the concentration reaches 90 % w/w H 2 SO 4. Regeneration of the acid is necessary to maintain efficiency and it is desirable to concentrate the acid to as high a concentration as possible. Unfortunately the water-sulfuric acid system shows a maximum boiling azeotrope at ~ 98. 5 % w/w H 2 SO 4. It is impossible to exceed the azeotrope with a equilibrium separation process such as distillation. In this paper the pressure dependence of the azeotrope is investigated together with the possibilities for concentrating the acid to ~ 99. 0 % w/w H 2 SO 4. Publications on the thermodynamics of the water-sulfuric acid system show that the position of the azeotrope is uncertain. Data found in literature, on the pressure dependence of the system, shows that at total pressures between 5 and 10 mbar the position of the azeotrope is close to 99. 0 % w/w H 2 SO 4. It is in this paper reported that a <b>flash</b> <b>vessel</b> or several flash vessels in series can provide the desired product concentration. Matlab simulations on a single stage flash shows for very low separation power with great losses of valuable sulphuric acid. The separation power is enhanced by connecting several flash units in series. The number of units depends strongly on the feed concentration. For producing a product of 98. 9 % w/w with a recovery of 99 % and a feed concentration of 98. 0 % w/w H 2 SO 4 two single stage flash units are required and with a feed concentration of 96 % w/w H 2 SO 4 four is required for the same requirements.

40|$|The vast {{majority}} of chemical and bio-chemical process plants are normally characterized by large number of measurements and {{relatively small number of}} manipulated variables; these thin plants have more output than input variables. As the number of manipulated variables restricts the number of controlled variables, thin plant has presented a daunting challenge to the engineers in selecting which measured variables to be controlled. In general, this is an important problem in modern process control today, because controlled variables selection {{is one of the key}} questions which must be carefully addressed in order to effectively design control strategies for process plants. While the issue relating to controlled variables selection has remained the key question to be resolved since the articulation of CSD problem by Foss in 1970 s, the work described in this thesis points out to another equally important question in CSD, that is, what is the sufficient number of controlled variables required? Thinking over this question leads one to the necessity for gaining a rational understating of the governing principle in partial control design, namely the variables interaction. In this thesis, we propose a novel data-oriented approach to solving the control structure problem within the context of partial control framework. This approach represents a significant departure from the mainstream methods in CSD, which currently can be broadly classified into two major categories as the mathematical-oriented and heuristic-hierarchical approaches. The key distinguishing feature of the proposed approach lies in its adoption of technique based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which is used to systematically determine the suitable controlled variables. Conversely, the determination of the controlled variables in mathematical-oriented and heuristic-hierarchical approaches is done via the mathematical optimization and process knowledge/engineering experience, respectively. It is important to note that, the data-oriented approach in this thesis emerges from the fusion of two important concepts, namely the partial control structure and PCA. While partial control concept provides the sound theoretical framework for addressing the CSD problem in a systematic manner, the PCA-based technique helps in determining not only the suitable controlled variables but also the sufficient number of controlled variables required. Since the classical framework of partial control is not amendable to a systematic way in the identification of controlled variables, it is necessary to develop a new framework of partial control in this thesis. Within this new framework the dominant variable can be clearly defined, and which in turn allows the incorporation of PCA-based technique for the systematic identification of controlled variables. The application of the data-oriented approach is demonstrated on a nonlinear multivariable bioprocess case study, called the two-stage continuous extractive (TSCE) alcoholic fermentation process. The system consists of 5 interlinked units: 2 bioreactors in series, a centrifuge, vacuum <b>flash</b> <b>vessel</b> and treatment tank. The comparison of the two-stage design with that of single-stage design reported in literature shows that: (1) both designs exhibit comparable performance in term of the maximum allowable trade-off values between yield and productivity, and (2) two-stage design exhibits stronger nonlinear behaviour than that of single-stage. Thus, the design of control strategies for the former is expected to be more challenging. Various partial control strategies are developed for the case study, such as basic partial control strategy, complete partial control strategies with and without PID enhancement technique and optimal size partial control strategy. Note that, this system consists of 16 output variables and only 6 potential manipulated variables, which has approximately 4, 000, 000 control structure alternatives. Therefore, the application of mathematical approach relying on optimization is not practical for this case study – i. e. assuming that evaluation of each alternative takes 30 seconds of optimization time, thus, complete screening will require almost 4 years to complete. Several exciting new insights crystallize from the simulation study performed on the case study, where two of them are most important from the perspective of effective design of partial control strategy: 1) There is an optimal size of partial control structure where too many controlled variables can lead to the presence of bottleneck control-loop, which in turn can severely limit the dynamic response of overall control system. On the other hand, too few controlled variables can lead to unacceptable variation or loss in performance measures. 2) The nature of variables interaction depends on the choice of control structure. Thus, it is important to ensure that the nature of open-loop variables interaction is preserved by the implementation of a particular control strategy. When this is achieved, then we say that this control system works synergistically with the inherent control capability of a given process – i. e. achieving the synergistic external-inherent control system condition. The proposed approach has been successfully applied to the case study, where the optimal partial control structure is found to be 3 x 3 i. e. 3 controlled variables are sufficient to meet all 3 types of control objectives: overall (implicit) performance objectives, constraint and inventory control objectives. Finally, the proposed approach effectively unifies the advantages of both mathematical-oriented and heuristic-hierarchical approaches, and while at the same time capable of overcoming many limitations faced by these two mainstream approaches...|$|E
