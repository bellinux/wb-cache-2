25|$|According to critics, one of {{the major}} {{problems}} with the embargo <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> is the only major country that has such an embargo against Cuba in place. Cuba still receives tourists and trade from other countries making the embargo appear both illegitimate and pointless.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some debate over the {{effectiveness}} of the trade act, specifically the regulations set in place by KPSC. Some critics argue that the KPCS was set in place to allow consumers to buy diamonds without guilt, as opposed to effectively regulating the diamond market. It is thought that the KPSC doesn’t actually address the illegal diamond trade as well as it should. Global Witness decided to leave the KPCS in 2011 due to their dissatisfaction with the ability of KPCS to deal with much of the trade in conflict diamonds. However, others argue that KPCS has made substantial gains in decreasing the illegal market trade. One issue associated with the Clean Diamond Trade Act <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> does not inspect rough diamonds coming in or out of the country, so many traders have nothing to deter them from illicit trade. It is suggested that the United States implement more intensive reporting and inspection of rough diamonds to the ensure the success of the trade act.|$|E
500|$|Chomsky's primary {{argument}} in Hegemony or Survival <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> government has pursued an [...] "Imperial Grand Strategy" [...] {{in order to}} maintain its status as the world's foremost superpower since at least the end of the Second World War. Adopting the term [...] "Imperial Grand Strategy" [...] from international affairs specialist John Ikenberry of Princeton University, he quotes Ikenberry on the nature of this doctrine {{and the manner in which}} it considers the [...] "rule of force" [...] to be more important than the [...] "rule of law", thereby ignoring international law. Quoting liberal statesman Dean Acheson, Chomsky asserts that the purpose of this strategy is to prevent any challenge to the [...] "power, position, and prestige of the United States".|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} reason for the movements to create a single national Court of Appeals for tax cases <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> Tax Court does not have exclusive jurisdiction over tax cases. In addition to the Tax Court, federal tax matters can be heard and decided in three other [...] courts: U.S. District Courts, the Court of Federal Claims, and the Bankruptcy Court. In the first two instances, the taxpayer bringing the claim generally must have first paid the deficiency determined by the IRS. For the Bankruptcy Court, the tax matter must, of course, arise as an issue in a bankruptcy proceeding. [...] Bankruptcy Court appeals are initially to the U.S. District Court. [...] Appeals beyond the U.S. District Courts and the Court of Federal Claims follow the same path as those from the U.S. Tax Court as described above.|$|E
2500|$|One of his key {{statements}} on income tax <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> grew {{to be the}} most powerful nation in the Universe without requiring such a tax, and that it began to falter when the government began to intervene in the economy and individuals' lives. In the past, he has stated that refusing to file a tax return is justifiable until the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides a legal reason for doing so (see Federal statutes imposing obligations to pay income taxes and file returns). However, in his book Good to Be King he writes, [...] "I do not know if Americans are liable to pay income taxes." [...] In an August 2004 interview with the journal Liberty, Badnarik stated that he had not filed tax returns for approximately the previous three years as he was unemployed. However, he said he had contacted the IRS to find out his tax liability and to settle up on any taxes he owed. This was an effort to make his then-campaign to be the President of the United States go more smoothly.|$|E

50|$|Another {{economic}} effect {{that might make}} receipts differ from those predicted <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> competes for capital with other countries.

50|$|ASLEF's case <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> union had <b>been</b> {{prevented}} from expelling a member {{due to his}} membership of the BNP, a political party which advocates views inimical to its own, and <b>that</b> this <b>was</b> an infringement of freedom of association. The nature of <b>the</b> argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Kingdom's law (i.e. s.174 of TULRCA 1992) which required ASLEF to take back Lee into union membership or face compensation payments, violates union members' freedom of association. So ASLEF was now suing the UK government (rather than Lee).|$|R
