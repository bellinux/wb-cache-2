5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, {{faster and more}} {{aggressive}} styles such as hardcore punk (e.g. Minor Threat), street punk (e.g. the Exploited), and anarcho-punk (e.g. Crass) had become the predominant mode of punk rock. Musicians <b>identifying</b> <b>with</b> or inspired by punk also pursued {{a broad range of}} other variations, giving rise to post-punk and new wave and later indie pop, alternative rock, and noise rock. By the 1990s, punk rock had re-emerged in the mainstream, as pop punk bands such as Green Day and the Offspring brought the genre widespread popularity.|$|E
5|$|People <b>identifying</b> <b>with</b> Asperger {{syndrome}} may {{refer to}} themselves in casual conversation as aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999). The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, {{and is often}} used to refer to non-autistic people. The Internet has allowed individuals with AS {{to communicate with each other}} in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like Wrong Planet have made it easier for individuals to connect.|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their <b>identifying</b> <b>with</b> the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E

40|$|Clinical {{diagnostics}} {{of chronic}} polymicrobial infections, {{such as those}} found in chronic wounds, represent a diagnostic challenge for both culture and molecular methods. In the current retrospective study, the results of aerobic bacterial cultures and culture-free bacterial identification using DNA analyses were compared. A total of 168 chronic wounds were studied. The majority of bacteria <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> culture testing were also <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> molecular testing, {{but the majority of}} bacteria <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> the molecular testing were not <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> culture testing. Seventeen (17) different bacterial taxa were <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> culture, and 338 different bacterial taxa were <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> molecular testing. This study demonstrates the increased sensitivity that molecular microbial identification can have over culture methodologies, and previous studies suggest that molecular bacterial identification can improve the clinical outcomes of patients with chronic wounds...|$|R
5|$|In January 1532, Cranmer was {{appointed}} the resident ambassador {{at the court}} of the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. As the emperor travelled throughout his realm, Cranmer had to follow him to his residence in Ratisbon (Regensburg). He passed through the Lutheran city of Nuremberg and saw {{for the first time}} the effects of the Reformation. When the Imperial Diet was moved to Nuremberg in the summer, he met the leading architect of the Nuremberg reforms, Andreas Osiander. They became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander's wife. This was all the more remarkable given that the marriage required him to set aside his priestly vow of celibacy. He did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous. Scholars note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into <b>identifying</b> <b>with</b> certain Lutheran principles. This progress in his personal life was not matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles, Catherine's nephew, to support the annulment of his aunt's marriage.|$|E

50|$|David R.

Indeed, such workers' organizational identification and professional identification combined to alter the influence of PPCV on performance behaviors. The results suggested that PPCV had the most negative influence on professional employees' work performance when employees strongly <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> the profession and weakly <b>identified</b> <b>with</b> the organization.|$|R

25|$|According to Rajneesh {{every human}} being is a Buddha with the {{capacity}} for enlightenment, capable of unconditional love and of responding rather than reacting to life, although the ego usually prevents this, <b>identifying</b> <b>with</b> social conditioning and creating false needs and conflicts and an illusory sense of identity that {{is nothing but a}} barrier of dreams.

25|$|The {{percentage}} of Christians among Asian Americans has declined sharply since the 1990s, chiefly due to largescale immigration from {{countries in which}} Christianity is a minority religion (China and India in particular). In 1990, 63% of the Asian Americans identified as Christians, while in 2001 only 43% did. This development {{has been accompanied by}} a rise in traditional Asian religions, with the people <b>identifying</b> <b>with</b> them doubling during the same decade.|$|E

25|$|Cricket {{never caught}} on in Canada, despite efforts by an imperial-minded elite {{to promote the}} game {{as a way of}} <b>identifying</b> <b>with</b> the British Empire. Canada, unlike Australia and the West Indies, {{witnessed}} a continual decline in the popularity of the game during 1860–1960. Linked to upper class British-Canadian elites, the game never became popular with the general public. In the summer season it had to compete with baseball. During the First World War, Canadian units stationed in Britain played baseball, not cricket.|$|E
25|$|Immigrants {{differ on}} their {{political}} views; however, the Democratic Party {{is considered to}} be in a far stronger position among immigrants overall. Research shows that religious affiliation can also significantly impact both their social values and voting patterns of immigrants, as well as the broader American population. Hispanic evangelicals, for example, are more strongly conservative than non-Hispanic evangelicals. This trend is often similar for Hispanics or others strongly <b>identifying</b> <b>with</b> the Catholic Church, a religion that strongly opposes abortion and gay marriage.|$|E
