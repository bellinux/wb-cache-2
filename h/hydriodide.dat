40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the clinical and bacteriological cure rates of cows with clinical mastitis following treatment with either tylosin base (5 g injected 3 times at 24 -h intervals; n = 306) or penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> (5 g injected 3 times at 24 -h intervals; n = 289). Duplicate milk samples were collected before treatment and again 14 ± 3 and 21 ± 3 d later for microbiological analysis. Only those quarters from which gram-positive mastitis pathogens were isolated before treatment were included in the analyses. Streptococcus uberis was the most prevalent isolate. The number of cows with clinical failure (i. e., retreated within 21 d of enrollment) did not differ between treatments (64 vs. 63, respectively). At the quarter level, there was no difference in the proportion of bacteriological cure between treatments (81. 2 vs. 83. 8 % for penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> or tylosin, respectively). The proportions of clinical and bacteriological cure were influenced by age, herd, severity of mastitis, number of glands within the cow with clinical mastitis, bacterial species, and days postpartum at enrollment. There was no difference between treatment groups for SCC (4. 46 vs. 4. 44 ± 0. 08, mean ± standard error of the difference in ln SCC for cows treated with penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> or tylosin, respectively) or production of milk solids (1. 45 vs. 1. 48 ± 0. 02 kg/d of milk fat + protein, for the penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> or tylosin treatment, respectively). Overall, there was no difference in the proportions of clinical failure (17. 3 vs. 16. 5 % of cows treated with penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> or tylosin, respectively) or bacteriological cure (79. 8 vs. 82. 0 % of cows treated with penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> or tylosin, respectively), or in SCC or milk production between dairy cows with clinical mastitis and those treated for clinical mastitis with 1 of 2 parenteral antibiotic therapies...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{concentration}} of penicillin G in mammary tissue and secretion of dry heifers following systemic administration of penethamate <b>hydriodide.</b> Six dairy heifers in late gestation received a single intramuscular injection of 10 g penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> and were sacrificed 24, 48 or 144 h after treatment. Penicillin G concentrations were measured in mammary tissue and secretion samples using HPLC. Penicillin G was detected in the Udder of two animals euthanized at 24 h (mammary tissue and secretion) and at 48 h post treatment (mammary secretion only) after administration at concentrations still close to or above MIC 90 values reported for the pathogens associated with heifer mastitis.

40|$|Prepartum {{intramammary}} {{treatment with}} antimicrobials of end-term dairy heifers has frequently been proposed as a practice {{to reduce the}} prevalence of intramammary infections (IMI) at calving. From a safety standpoint for both animal and administrator, systemic treatment is preferred. A clinical trial was conducted on heifers from 10 well-managed, commercial dairy farms with a low prevalence of heifer mastitis. The aim was to assess both the short- and long-term effects of a systemic prepartum therapy with penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> on udder health and milk production. Because {{it was hypothesized that}} some herds would benefit more from this treatment than others, specific herd-level information was collected {{before the start of the}} actual trial to screen for and explain potential herd-specific treatment effects. Further, the effect of treatment on antimicrobial susceptibility of staphylococcal isolates was monitored. End-term heifers were either treated systemically (over 3 consecutive days) 2 wk before expected calving date with penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> (n = 76) or remained untreated (n = 73). Systemic prepartum treatment of end-term heifers with penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> resulted in fewer IMI in early lactation. However, all 6 cases of clinical mastitis in early lactation occurred in the treatment group [Streptococcus uberis (n = 1), Corynebacterium, bovis (n = 1), Staphylococcus aureus (n 1); 1 sample was contaminated; 2 samples remained culture negative]. No long-term treatment effects (from 4 to 120 d in milk) on milk production, udder health, or culling hazard during later lactation were detected, although treated heifers belonging to herds classified as having low-yielding heifers out-produced the control heifers. Moreover, penicillin susceptibility of staphylococci isolated from milk samples of treated or control heifers did not differ. Herds with a low, prevalence of heifer mastitis are not likely to benefit from prepartum systemic antimicrobial treatment of the end-term heifers...|$|E

40|$|A randomized, {{controlled}} {{field trial}} {{was performed in}} The Netherlands to determine the therapeutic efficacy of parenteral penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> (Leocillin®) against naturally occurring, chronic, streptococcal mastitis during lactation. Quarter milk samples were collected from subclinical cases of Streptococcus uberis or Streptococcus dysgalactiae mastitis {{to determine the effect}} of treatment on bacteriological cure and somatic cell count (SCC) at quarter level. A quarter was considered to be cured when the bacterial species, isolated prior to treatment, was not isolated from the quarter milk samples taken on days 10 and 20 post-treatment (bacteriological cure), or when a quarter milk SCC (QMSCC) was &# 60; 250000 cells/ml on days 10 and 20 post-treatment (SCC cure). Longitudinal data analysis was performed to determine the effect of antibiotic therapy on SCC and milk yield at cow level. Bacteriological cure occurred in 59 % of 29 treated quarters, while no cure was observed in any of the 21 untreated control quarters. Treatment resulted in a significant decrease in SCC at cow and quarter level in comparison with untreated controls. There was no significant effect of treatment on milk production. Antibacterial treatment of subclinical streptococcal infections during lactation also prevented clinical mastitis. Furthermore, the treatment may contribute to reduction of bulk milk SCC and to prevention of pathogen spread in dairy herds...|$|E
40|$|Factors {{affecting}} bacteriological cure rates (BCR) and new intramammary infections (IMI) {{during the}} dry period as well as clinical mastitis (CM) during early lactation were investigated in 414 German Holstein dairy cows receiving dry cow therapy. Cows were treated with either benethamine benzylpenicillin (300, 000 IU), penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> (100, 000 IU), and framycetin sulphate (100 mg, n = 136), or cefquinome (150 mg, n = 135), or benzathine cloxacillin (1, 280 mg, n = 143). Overall BCR, IMI, and CM at parturition were 86. 4 %, 20. 7 %, and 4. 3 %, respectively. The three antibiotic treatments differed only in BCR, with cloxacillin yielding better results than the others. Udder quarters from cows with > 4 lactations had {{a higher risk of}} IMI and CM at calving. Chronic changes in udder tissues were linked to a lower BCR and were associated with a higher risk of CM during early lactation. The risk of CM at calving was higher in udder quarters with unspecific or subclinical mastitis before drying off. In conclusion, with antibiotic dry cow therapy, age and health status of the udder appear to be major determinants of IMI and CM {{during the dry}} period and early lactation, while BCR was associated with the antibiotic type and udder tissue status...|$|E

40|$|A {{randomized}} controlled field trial {{was performed to}} evaluate the efficacy of a 3 -d treatment regimen with i. m. penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> compared with no treatment in lactating cows with subclinical mastitis. To be included, a cow had to have 2 somatic cell counts (SCC) > 300, 000 cells/mL at the last 3 monthly controls, 1 or more quarters with SCC > 250, 000 cells/mL, and the same bacterial species isolated in 2 consecutive samples 2 to 4 d apart. A total of 151 quarters from 92 cows were monitored for 2 mo following treatment. Quarter milk samples were examined for bacteriological cure (BC) and SCC at 14, 28, and 60 d after treatment. Bacteriological cure was defined as not having the same bacterial species isolated from the quarter milk samples taken at 14 and 28 d posttreatment as in the samples taken before treatment. Systemic treatment with penethamate resulted in BC in 59. 5 % of quarters and 52. 2 % of cows, compared with 16. 7 and 10. 9 % in the untreated cows. Somatic cell count decreased significantly in the penethamate-treated cows, steadily {{in the case of}} BC and transiently when the infections persisted. This study confirms that systemic treatment of subclinical mastitis with penethamate is effective and that BC of infected quarters has a sustained positive effect on milk SCC during the 2 mo following treatment...|$|E
40|$|It was {{suspected}} early, by Askanazy, in 1896, that Trichuris triehiura sucks {{blood from the}} mucosa of the large intestine. ' Direct evidence {{of the presence of}} blood within the parasites was provided by Ferngn-NiiÃezin 1927, who obtained crystals of human hematin <b>hydriodide</b> from groundT. trichiura, 4 Chitwoodand Chitwoodin 1937 reported erythrocytes in the esophageal lumen of T. ovia, 3 and in 1964 Burrows and Lulls observed a positive reaction to benzidine in 298 out of 300 parasites cut or crushed before the reagents were added. 4 They also found leukocytes and erythrocytes in the reddish fluid obtained from the cecum of the worm. These studies pro vided evidence that the wbipworm sucks blood from the mucosa of the large intestine, but how much blood is lost per worm was still unknown, and the relation between the degree of infection and anemia was not clear. We {{have had the opportunity to}} study fecal blood loss in a group of nine persons with various degrees of infection with T. trichiura and with no other parasitic infection leading to blood loss.

40|$|The {{individual}} {{stages of}} the interaction of amines with halogens - in particular, iodine - have been studied. 'In {{the course of this}} investigation, {{it has been shown that}} amines and iodine interact initially via the nitrogen lone pair to form molecular complexes (CHARGE-TRANSFER COMPLEXES). Several of these have been isolated and some of their properties studied in detail. It was thus determined that these complexes can undergo further chemical change during which the hydrogen iodide which is generated converts any unreacted amine to the corresponding hydroiodide salt. The latter is inert to oxidation by iodine under the conditions employed. It has been shown that this mode of reaction is dependent upon the availability of a-aliphatic hydrogen in the amine molecule. The initial oxidation product derived from the amine is the corresponding IMMONIUM SALT. This intermediate may, according to reaction conditions, undergo hydrolysis to secondary amine and carbonyl compound or conversion to ENAMINE; the latter may then undergo further transformation by inter- or intramolecular reaction. The nature of the products isolated from the oxidation of several amines by iodine in isopropanol solution has been rationalised in terms of this generalised reaction pathway, which is analogous to those proposed by other workers for the oxidation of amines by other two-electron oxidants. This reaction pathway also applies to the formation of an industrial disinfectant by the action of solid iodine on a commercially available tertiary amine mixture. It was thus demonstrated that most of the amine used is recovered from the reaction mixture as the base hydroiodide and that the hydrogen iodide needed for this conversion is formed during the degradative oxidation of a minor proportion of the starting material. Furthermore, it has been established that the biocidal principle of the commercial disinfectant formulation is the N-alkyldiethanolamine <b>hydriodide.</b> A concurrent study of the effect of structure on biological activity has confirmed the dependence of disinfectant activity on detergent properties in this class of disinfectants...|$|E
40|$|Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis {{is one of}} the commonest eye {{diseases}} of cattle. A specialised organism Moraxella bovis, is generally held to be responsible for the often serious damage to the cornea and the conjunctiva. Temporary blindness is common but even without treatment, most cattle eventually regain their vision. Although the disease has been recognised for more than 30 years in most cattle-farming areas of the world, only in the past 8 - 10 years has it become evident in New Zealand. A wide range of antibacterial products has been used for treatment but there has been very little definitive work undertaken which would form a sound basis for any schedule of medication. In view of the information lacking in this respect, it was decided to study the pharmacokinetics of an antimicrobial drug in the conjunctival sac fluid after different formulations of the drug had been administered by different routes. Penicillin was chosen as the model antibiotic because it is remarkably free of side effects, effective against M. bovis and available in a range of products suitable for administration by various means. The overall aim of the work was to determine a concentration-time profile for penicillin in conjunctival sac fluid (CF) and it was reasoned that this data could then be used to establish a schedule of treatment that would produce an optimum effect against M. bovis. The preliminary requirement of the research programme was to investigate a suitable method of collecting unchanged samples of CF over a number of days (i. e. 1 - 7 days). As soon as the project was initiated, it became clear that any substantial distress to the animals caused lachrymation, and the possibility of the CF then containing endogenous antibacterial substances could not be discounted. Of the three methods of collection tested, the use of blunted capillary tubes was found to be best for the purpose because the method avoided any local tissue irritation and the cattle soon learned to tolerate any associated handling and minor restraint. Special safeguards were built into the experiment to confirm the absence of antibacterial substances other than penicillin. The specificity of the inhibitory substance in CF, namely penicillin, was regularly confirmed by testing for parallelism against standard dilutions of penicillin, and periodically by neutralizing all antibacterial activity in a sample, using penicillinase. Estimations of the penicillin concentration in CF samples were carried out by means of the agar-well diffusion technique. Minor modifications to the basic assay system were required to ensure that the sensitivity would cover the range of penicillin concentrations expected to appear in CF. After a series of titrations involving the size of the inoculum of the indicator organism, the depth and volume of the agar medium, the volume of the test solution for each well and the incubation schedule, each variable was standardized for all subsequent assays. A large plate (28 x 28 cm, containing 64 wells 4. 5 mm in diameter, 2. 5 cm apart) permitted the assay of 12 CF samples alongside four standard dilutions of penicillin under uniform conditions. Using Bacillus subtilis as the indicator organism, the assay system was sensitive in the range between 10 and 0. 07 iu/ml penicillin, with a standard error of predicted values of 0. 04 - 0. 17. In order to nominate a penicillin concentration in CF that would be effective against M. bovis, the penicillin sensitivity of several strains of the organism were measured in terms of their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). The four New Zealand isolates tested were highly sensitive; most having a MIC of penicillin of 0. 03 iu/ml, and this was identical for the bactericidal concentration. After making allowance for an in vivo safety factor of 5, the minimum therapeutic concentration (MTC) of penicillin against M. bovis was defined for this series of experiments to be 0. 15 iu/ml. The length of time that the penicillin concentration in CF remained equal to or above the MTC following treatment with any particular product, was considered as the duration of therapeutic concentration (DTC; hours) for that particular treatment. The major experiments using clinically normal cows involved the estimation of penicillin concentration in CF following systemic, subconjunctival or topical administration. Every treatment was repeated in five or six animals but without exception any variation in the DTC between eyes and animals was found to be not significant. In all experiments, the decline in penicillin concentration in CF followed an exponential pattern, irrespective of the route of administration. A series of systemic injections was carried out by the appropriate route using three different products of penicillin at a standard dose-rate of 20, 000 iu/kg. Penicillin concentrations observed in CF (± SEM) following the intravenous injection of sodium benzyl penicillin (peak 2. 0 iu/ml and DTC 5. 5 ± 0. 25 hours) and the intramuscular injection of procaine penicillin (peak 1. 0 iu/ml and DTC 16. 5 ± 1. 25), were considered inadequate for the treatment of IBK. Penethamate <b>hydriodide,</b> administered by either the intramuscular or the subcutaneous route, achieved an approximate peak concentration of 3. 0 iu/ml and produced a minimum therapeutic duration of 61 ± 5. 57 hours. Such a difference between the kinetics of penethamate <b>hydriodide</b> and benzyl penicillin was attributed to the greater lipid solubility of the diethylaminoethyl ester of penicillin. Although the profile of penicillin in CF following penethamate administration seems favourable, the cost of the product would probably prohibit its regular use. In a further experiment in which half the dose was used, the DTC was reduced to 23. 5 ± 4 hours. A subconjunctival injection of procaine penicillin at a dosage of 6 x 105 iu in 2 ml, administered either through the skin or through the conjunctiva, achieved an approximate peak of 8 iu/ml for both routes and DTCs of 67. 6 ± 5. 0 hours and 40 ± 2. 6 hours respectively. The faster rate of penicillin decay following an injection given through the conjunctiva, is possibly attributable to the back diffusion of the drug through the needle puncture. In general, the penicillin profile in CF following a subconjunctival injection is conducive to an extended bactericidal effect and the trial results tend to confirm the clinical impressions of its usefulness in the field. Treatment by this means is relatively cheap and easily undertaken. If a more prolonged effect is desirable, another dose might be administered two days after the first. Topical application of sodium benzyl penicillin in aqueous solution at a concentration isotonic with 0. 9 % saline, produced a DTC in CF for 12. 6 ± 1. 5 hours. This duration is considered long for a water soluble salt in an aqueous base. When this salt and other less water soluble ones were formulated in an ointment base,the time of effect was significantly prolonged. Sodium benzyl penicillin and procaine penicillin in the ointment base, produced DTCs of 39. 8 ± 2 hours and 37 ± 4 hours respectively, while the ointment formulation of benethamine penicillin produced a DTC of 56 ± 4. 5 hours. The prolonged decline observed for all eye ointments can be partly accounted for by the viscous nature of the base but other differences may be dependent on the relative water solubility of each penicillin salt. In addition, the various structures of the surface mucosae such as crypts and specialised cells, are likely to retard free diffusion and therefore retain penicillin, in CF. The extent of dissociation of a substance depending on its pKa may also influence the overall rate of decline. Regular examination of the treated eyes and cell counts undertaken on CF samples, did not indicate any inflammatory reaction even after repeated application of ointments. The various penicillin profiles observed in CF now provide a sound basis for establishing treatment schedules. Optimum treatment schedules can be advocated for different penicillin products, based on concentrations and durations that could be expected to control M. bovis infection in superficial tissues of the eye. However, in order to confirm the therapeutic effectiveness of such schedules, controlled clinical trials using infected animals are obligatory...|$|E
