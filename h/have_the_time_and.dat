5|$|Duration: For most goods, {{the longer}} a price change holds, {{the higher the}} {{elasticity}} is likely to be, {{as more and more}} consumers find they <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> inclination to search for substitutes. When fuel prices increase suddenly, for instance, consumers may still fill up their empty tanks in the short run, but when prices remain high over several years, more consumers will reduce their demand for fuel by switching to carpooling or public transportation, investing in vehicles with greater fuel economy or taking other measures. This does not hold for consumer durables such as the cars themselves, however; eventually, it may become necessary for consumers to replace their present cars, so one would expect demand to be less elastic.|$|E
25|$|In Hinduism, an icon, image, statue or idol {{is called}} Murti or Pratima. Major Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartaism favor {{the use of}} Murti (idol). These traditions {{suggest that it is}} easier to {{dedicate}} time and focus on spirituality through anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic icons. The Bhagavad Gita – a Hindu scripture, in verse 12.5, states that only a few <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> mind to ponder and fix on the unmanifested Absolute (abstract formless Brahman), and {{it is much easier to}} focus on qualities, virtues, aspects of a manifested representation of god, through one's senses, emotions and heart, because the way human beings naturally are.|$|E

[...] Murray concluded his review, [...] "It may be that Fringe has bitten off more than it can chew here, and the storytelling {{is about to get}} hopelessly convoluted, as it often does once time-travel enters the picture. But for now, I’m going to enjoy living with and thinking over what I’ve seen so far. And I’m going to trust that no matter how crazy Fringes fourth season gets, the writers are going to keep bringing everything back to less mind-bending questions". Some reviewers questioned the logic of Peter having never existed, though others expressed their trust in the writers' ability to make it work.|$|E
500|$|The {{team also}} faced several {{technical}} issues, such as {{dealing with a}} fixed font size, and having to type in additional symbols using language input keys so the code would function. Consequently, the text was still read as Japanese by the word processor; the computer's spellcheck could not be used, and mistakes had to be caught manually. To complicate matters, the Japanese text used obscure kanji symbols carried over from Chinese writing. Swear words were used frequently in the localization to help convey the original Japanese meaning, though most profanities were censored in a manner described by Square employee Richard Honeywood as the [...] "old comic book '@#$%!'-type replacement". The European release was described as being in a worse condition, as the translations into multiple European languages were outsourced by Sony to another company, further hindering communication. [...] For the PC port, Square did its best to fix translation and grammar mistakes for the North American and European versions, but did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> budget to retranslate all the text. According to Honeywood, the success of Final Fantasy VII in the West encouraged Square {{to focus more on}} localization quality; on future games, Square hired additional translators and editors, while also streamlining communication between the development and localization teams.|$|E

And if they are just cutting and cutting and cutting, and their unemployment rate is going up and up and up, and people are pulling back further from spending money because they're feeling a lot of pressure—ironically, that can actually make it harder for them to carry out some of these reforms over the long term... n addition to sensible ways to deal with debt and government finances, there's a parallel discussion that's taking place among European leaders to figure out how do we also encourage growth and show some flexibility to allow some of these reforms to really take root." ...|$|E

[...] The magazine said that if Derek chose to have an affair with Kat, he could end up back in prison if Alfie found out and would be taken away from his daughter Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks). They later said that Derek had previously declared that he and Kat were [...] "two peas in a pod", which would [...] "make her very appealing to an egotist like Derek!" [...] They said that [...] "sparks would fly if Derek and Kat hooked up. He's got that dangerous edge that [...] Kat loves, but Alfie lacks! And we all know that Derek's a man who's used to getting what he wants—every time..." [...] Soaplife said that Derek is part of every other storyline and actor Foreman's contract was extended, so the chances of it being Derek are high, but they did not want it to be Derek. However, they later said they thought it would be Derek, as love is not Kat's motivation (ruling out Jack), and Derek {{is the only one who}} would not be cheating on a partner, saying the others [...] "would have to cheat on their other half [...] for no better reason than Kat has to cheat on Alfie (ie. none). And that would be too far-fetched." [...] They said Derek would probably enjoy the danger of being caught out by Alfie, and continued to rule out the other suspects, maintaining that they have seen nothing to change their minds that it is Derek. All About Soap wondered if Derek would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> inclination to woo Kat as he is struggling to bond with his children Alice and Joey Branning (David Witts), and opined that he would, and the fact that [...] "he's just the wrong side of dodgy, [...] right up Kat's street. Walford's creepiest couple could be on the cards!" [...] They made him their joint third favourite for the affair, along with Ray, and later said that an affair between Kat and Derek would be [...] "very believable" [...] but [...] "more than a little bit gross", noting that Derek is on a power trip and Kat loves to be dominated and as there is more to the affair than physical attraction, there would be a [...] "strong chance" [...] it would be Derek.
