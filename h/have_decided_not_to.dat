5|$|Lance Armstrong {{was removed}} from the head of the list after having all seven of his Tour {{victories}} stripped when he was found guilty of repeated doping offences. Had his tainted Tour victories been reallocated (as were the victories of Floyd Landis and Contador) to the second placed rider in each race, Jan Ullrich would have joined the list with 4 Tour wins. However, the race organisers ASO <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> reallocate the titles won in those years, in recognition of the historic doping problem in the sport at that time - Ullrich himself having been banned for a doping violation. Ullrich, therefore, has a single Tour victory to his name.|$|E

On 2 October 2012 Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, while stating that Wilders' views were offensive, stated {{that he would not}} block the visa application. Bowen stated: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> intervene to deny him a visa because I believe that our democracy is strong enough, our multiculturalism robust enough and our commitment to freedom of speech entrenched enough that our society can withstand the visit of a fringe commentator {{from the other side of}} the world".|$|E

2500|$|Austen's {{style was}} heavily {{influenced}} by {{the language of the}} King James Version of the Bible and, especially, by the Book of Common Prayer, both of which Austen heard spoken every week all of her life as a part of Anglican services. According to Isabel Grundy, [...] "the almost prehistorical authors of the Old Testament have bequeathed her their rapidity and spareness of narrative, the New Testament writers their remarkable ability to enter the common mind and to conjure an illusion of verisimilitude by means of a single detail... her taste for brief declarative sentences is something she shares with the gospels." [...] However, while Austen's style was {{heavily influenced by}} these works, she seems to <b>have</b> <b>decided</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> refer in her work directly to the Bible or other sacred works. Doody points out that [...] "she is singular among novelists of her age in her refusal to admit references to the Bible, or to biblical characters, scenes or stories." ...|$|E
