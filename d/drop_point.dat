5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary tactic of Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
25|$|The PSP {{version of}} Battlefront II does not feature the Rise of the Empire campaign. Instead it {{features}} three single-player Challenge modes; Imperial Enforcer, Rogue Assassin, and Rebel Raider. In Imperial Enforcer the player {{is sent to}} eliminate indigenous species on several given planets, such as Gungans on Naboo and Ewoks on Endor. Rogue Assassin requires the player to eliminate all Imperial officers on a given sets of planets. Bonus points are awarded for any other kills. Finally, Rebel Raider tasks the player with locating specific objects in a map and returning them to a designated <b>drop</b> <b>point,</b> similar to Capture the flag.|$|E
25|$|Before being encircled, the Ninth Army {{had already}} {{suffered}} heavy {{losses in the}} Battle of the Seelow Heights. It is estimated that, {{at the start of}} the encirclement, it had fewer than 1,000 guns and mortars, approximately 79 tanks, and probably a total of 150–200 combat-ready armoured fighting vehicles left. In all, there were about 80,000 men in the pocket, the majority of whom belonged to the Ninth Army, consisting of the XI SS Panzer Corps, V SS Mountain Corps and the newly acquired V Corps, but there was also the Frankfurt Garrison. The number of tanks reported included 36 tanks in the XI SS Panzer Corps, including up to 14 King Tigers of the 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion. Air supply was attempted on April 25 and 26, but could not be carried out because the planes that had taken off could not find the <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> for supply, and no contact with the encircled army could be established.|$|E

25|$|After {{the attack}} {{aircraft}} had finished their bombing runs the six transports, {{which had been}} holding in wait to the east, commenced their formation run towards Cassinga {{at an altitude of}} 200 feet (60 m). Shortly before reaching the base, the six aircraft climbed to , the drop height, and lined up for the drop. However, required visual 'tracking and distance' co-ordination markers were obscured by smoke from the bombing run, the drop zone (DZ) box scaling and <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> distances were incorrect - due to the reconnaissance scaling errors - and the drop was a shambles with nearly all the paratroopers being dropped off-target, some on the West side of the river and some into tall maize where they had problems linking up. The resultant confusion caused numerous delays, ruining the schedule of the 'drop-to-contact' plan, and much of the advantage of surprise. The disastrous drop also meant that it would be nearly an hour before C-Company was able to move into position on {{the eastern side of the}} camp and seal off the escape routes and as a result a number of top PLAN commanders, including Dimo Amaambo and Greenwell Matongo (two principal targets of the attack) escaped (with Amaambo later becoming the first head of the Namibian Defence Force in 1990).|$|E
500|$|Most wartime optical sights {{like the}} Mk. XIV were useless for {{operations}} in jet aircraft. Flying at roughly twice the altitude {{and three times}} the speed of their wartime antecedents, the range, the distance the bombs travelled after being dropped, increased from perhaps [...] {{to as much as}} [...] This long range, plus the additional altitude, made the distance between the target and aircraft so great that it was often impossible to see the target before the aircraft had already passed the <b>drop</b> <b>point.</b> Optical bombing quickly gave way to radar bombing, although the Mk.

Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing {{they are not going}} to budge, she stands up to them and says she finds it interesting that they are the camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he will not be able to protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Dropping</b> <b>point</b> {{is used in}} {{combination}} with other testable properties to determine the suitability of greases for specific applications. It is applicable only to greases that contain soap thickeners. Greases with other thickeners, such as many synthetic greases, do not change state. Instead, they separate oil, and the <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> as a phase transition does not apply.|$|R
5000|$|To {{execute a}} test, the oil/block is heated, while being stirred, {{at a rate}} of [...] to [...] per minute until the {{temperature}} is approximately [...] below the expected <b>dropping</b> <b>point.</b> The heat is reduced until the test tube temperature is at most [...] less than the oil/block temperature. Once the temperature has stabilized the sample is inserted. The <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> is the temperature recorded on the test tube thermometer, plus a correction factor for the oil/block temperature, when a drop of grease falls {{through the hole in the}} grease cup. If the drop trails a thread, the dropping temperature is the temperature at which the thread breaks.D-2265 explains that the <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> is useful to assist in identifying the type of grease, and for establishing and maintaining benchmarks for quality control. It adds that the results are not sufficient to assess service performance because <b>dropping</b> <b>point</b> is a static test.|$|R
500|$|Juliet is in bed after {{sleeping}} with Goodwin. Afterwards, she is given x-rays of Ben's back, {{and when she}} determines that Ben has a tumor, she confronts him and accuses him of lying about Rachel. He denies lying to her and refuses {{to let her go}} home. The next day, immediately after Flight 815 crashes, Ben takes Juliet to the Flame Station to see Mikhail. Ben tells Mikhail that he wants information on all of the passengers of the plane, then asks him to bring up a live feed. On the screen a newspaper is shown with the current date, September 22, 2004, followed by a shot of Rachel playing with her child (Rachel named her son Julian, presumably after Juliet) in a playground, and Ben explains that her cancer is in complete remission. The final flashback shows Juliet and Ben discussing their plans immediately before the events of [...] "Left Behind". Ben tells her to handcuff herself to Kate and say she was left behind. She is also told that Claire's [...] "implant" [...] has been [...] "activated" [...] and that this will make Claire ill. Juliet is to use drugs left at the <b>drop</b> <b>point</b> to cure her and earn the trust of the survivors; Ben gives her a gas mask and leaves. While setting up her shelter, Juliet looks around the camp and ties a final double knot as Jack smiles at her.|$|E

2500|$|The Norden thus {{calculated}} two angles: {{the range}} angle {{based on the}} altitude, airspeed and ballistics; and the current angle to the target, based on the ground speed and heading of the aircraft. The {{difference between these two}} angles represented the [...] "correction" [...] that needed to be applied to bring the aircraft over the proper <b>drop</b> <b>point.</b> If the aircraft was properly aligned with the target on the bomb run, the difference between the range and target angles would be continually reduced, eventually to zero (within the accuracy of the mechanisms). At this moment the Norden automatically dropped the bombs.|$|E

2500|$|The Norden {{worked in}} an entirely {{different}} fashion, based on the [...] "synchronous" [...] or [...] "tachometric" [...] method. Internally, the calculator continually computed the impact point, as was the case for previous systems. However, the resulting range angle was not displayed directly to the bombardier or dialed into the sights. Instead, the bombardier used the sighting telescope to locate the target long in advance of the <b>drop</b> <b>point.</b> A separate section of the calculator used the inputs for altitude and airspeed to determine the angular velocity of the target, the speed at which it would be seen drifting backward due to the forward motion of the aircraft. The output of this calculator drove a rotating prism at that angular speed {{in order to keep the}} target centered in the telescope. In a properly adjusted Norden, the target remains motionless in the sights.|$|E

The produced bio-based grease is expected to have better performance, and apply in variety industry such as agriculture/farming, forestry applications and food processing. The stearic acid, lithium hydroxide monohydrate and waste cooking oil compositions were manipulated in this research. The operating temperature and mixing period were also studied. The characteristics of produced grease were analyzed in order to evaluate the performance of the grease.

5000|$|The clip point style {{allows a}} quicker, and thus deeper, {{puncture}} upon insertion (clip point knives being thinner at the spine).
