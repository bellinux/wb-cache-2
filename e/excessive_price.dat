25|$|Crassus {{may also}} have had another reason—having {{to do with the}} equites—for joining an {{alliance}} against the optimates. Cicero noted that in 60 BC Crassus advocated for the equites and induced them demand that the senate annul some contracts they had taken up in the Roman province of Asia (in today’s western Turkey) at an <b>excessive</b> <b>price.</b> The equites (equestrians) were a wealthy class of entrepreneurs who constituted the second social order in Rome, just below the patricians. Many equites were publicani. These were contractors who acted as suppliers for the army and construction projects (which they also oversaw) and as tax collectors. The state auctioned the contracts for both suppliers and tax collectors to private firms, which had to pay for them in advance. The publicani had overextended themselves and fell into debt. Cicero thought that these contracts had been taken up in the rush for competition and that the demand was disgraceful and a confession of rash speculation. Nevertheless, he supported it to avoid the equites becoming alienated with the senate and to maintain harmony between patricians and equites. The proposal was opposed by the consul Quintus Caecilius Celer and Cato the Younger. It was rejected. Cicero though that the equites were now at loggerheads with the senate. It has been suggested that Crassus was closely associated with the equites and had investments with them. It is likely that Crassus also saw the alliance with Pompey to ensure Caesar’s consulship as a means to pass a measure to relieve publicani in debt.|$|E
40|$|<b>Excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> by a {{dominant}} firm is {{considered as one}} of the most blatant forms of abuse. Despite this, competition authorities frequently refrain from intervening against <b>excessive</b> <b>prices.</b> The non-interventionist approach is based, among others, on the premise that high prices encourage new entry and thereby should be feared less. According to this view, in many cases, <b>excessive</b> <b>prices</b> are likely to be competed away and make intervention redundant. This paper questions this conventional view and reconsiders whether <b>excessive</b> <b>prices</b> are indeed self-correcting. It illustrates how, in the majority of cases, <b>excessive</b> <b>prices</b> will not attract new entry of viable competitors, whether entry barriers are high or low. Furthermore, it shows how, at times, the prohibition of <b>excessive</b> <b>prices</b> may encourage, rather than discourage, entry. By doing so, this paper narrows and focuses the arguments against intervention. Accordingly, it concludes that if <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> is not to be prohibited, it should not be because it is thought to be 'self-correcting,' but rather for reasons such as the need to stimulate investment or difficulties of implementation, which should be assessed on a case by case basis. © The Author (2008).

40|$|One of the thorniest {{areas of}} {{antitrust}} enforcement is whether, and how, {{to deal with}} <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> allegations. Even in jurisdictions that have laws against <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing,</b> {{there has been little}} case law on the issue. A recent dispute over the pricing of flat steel in South Africa provides helpful guidance on the correct approach to <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> cases. The Competition Tribunal took a structural approach and deduced the existence of <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> on the basis of super-dominance and market segmentation. The Competition Appeal Court overturned this decision and clearly stated that (1) an empirical exercise comparing prices with cost benchmarks is required in assessing these cases, and (2) <b>excessive</b> <b>prices</b> need to be judged against the long-run average costs of an efficient firm. A purely structural approach was not deemed adequate. In this article, we describe the case and explain why the judgment by the Competition Appeal Court is sound from an economic perspective and why it sets an important precedent in this area of competition law...|$|R

Gibberne is now working at the quantitative handling of his preparation, with especial reference to its distinctive effects upon different types of constitution. He then hopes to find a Retarder with which to dilute its present rather excessive potency. The Retarder will, of course, have the reverse effect to the Accelerator; used alone it should enable the patient to spread a few seconds over many hours of ordinary time,--and so to maintain an apathetic inaction, a glacier-like absence of alacrity, amidst the most animated or irritating surroundings. The two things together must necessarily work an entire revolution in civilised existence. It is the beginning of our escape from that Time Garment of which Carlyle speaks. While this Accelerator will enable us to concentrate ourselves with tremendous impact upon any moment or occasion that demands our utmost sense and vigour, the Retarder will enable us to pass in passive tranquillity through infinite hardship and tedium. Perhaps I am a little optimistic about the Retarder, which has indeed still to be discovered, but about the Accelerator there is no possible sort of doubt whatever. Its appearance upon the market in a convenient, controllable, and assimilable form is a matter of the next few months. It will be obtainable of all chemists and druggists, in small green bottles, at a high but, considering its extraordinary qualities, by no means <b>excessive</b> <b>price.</b> Gibberne's Nervous Accelerator it will be called, and he hopes to be able to supply it in three strengths: one in 200, one in 900, and one in 2000, distinguished by yellow, pink, and white labels respectively.|$|E
40|$|European {{competition}} laws condemn as ‘exploitative abuses’ the pricing policies of dominant firms {{that may result}} in a direct loss of consumer welfare. Article 82 (a) of the EC Treaty, for example, expressly states that imposing ‘unfair’ prices on consumers by dominant suppliers constitutes an abuse. Several firms have been found to abuse their dominant positions by charging <b>excessive</b> <b>prices</b> in cases brought by the European Commission and the competition authorities of several Member States. Those cases show that the assessment of <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> is subject to substantial conceptual and practical difficulties, and that any policy that seeks to detect and prohibit <b>excessive</b> <b>prices</b> is likely to yield incorrect predictions in numerous instances. In this Paper we evaluate {{the pros and cons of}} alternative legal standards towards <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> by explicitly considering the likelihood of false convictions/acquittals and the costs associated with those errors. We find that the legal standard that maximizes long-term consumer welfare given the information typically available to regulators would involve no ex post intervention on the pricing decisions of dominant firms. A possible exception to this general rule is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates peculiarities in the {{treatment}} of abuse of dominance under Egyptian Competition Law and evaluates their potential effects in the economy. Particularly, it recognizes the lack of <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> prohibition and the deployment of effects-based approach to abuse of dominance at the present stage as likely peculiarities in Egyptian Competition Law that may harm the economy. It is specifically argued that the success of the practice of <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing,</b> at least in exceptional circumstances, may become more plausible at this stage in Egypt, as an emerging economy, since it lacks the necessary competition culture and, as such, its market is highly concentrated. The paper, furthermore, finds that employing an effects-based approach at this early stage of competition law enforcement may not be suitable due to the understandable lack of experience that may increase the likelihood of committing judicial errors. It is, however, perceived that investigating the practice of <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> is quite complex and, as such prohibiting {{it may not be the}} best initiative at this stage. Moreover, it is suggested that employing an effects-based analysis, as opposed to per se approach, may help avoid type II errors (erroneously condemning pro-competitive practices). It is, hence, suggested to stick by this approach at the current stage; so long as caution is taken in relation to practices that generate questionable anti-competitive effects. Whether for introducing an <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> prohibition in the future (should the practice continue to pose a threat) or employing effects-based approach, it is argued that increasing economic expertise in the field of competition law and cooperating with competition authorities of the developed world remains central...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the prohibition on <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> in Article 102 TFEU. This prohibition belongs {{to one of the}} most criticized ambits of EU competition law. Still, the Court of Justice of the European Union has clearly stated that high prices by dominant undertakings may amount to an abuse in some cases, most recently in September in its judgment AKKA/LAA (C- 177 / 16). The case-law, as well as the Commission’s decisional practice, is very sparse and at times in-coherent. This research attempts to assess and systematize the case-law by focusing both on the assessment of excessiveness and on enforcement in cases where <b>prices</b> are deemed <b>excessive.</b> The research takes a legal dogmatic approach. As is customary in research on EU law, linguistic, systemic and teleological interpretation is used. When dealing with competition law, the economics that are at the backdrop of the law cannot be ignored. In addition to a legal dogmatic approach, an interdisciplinary approach will hence also be adopted. It is also important to note, that the research presumes consumer welfare to be the ultimate aim of EU competition law. The first chapter of the actual research contains a look at the economics of pricing, as well as an overview on the prohibition on abuse of dominance pursuant to Article 102 TFEU. This is justified by the need to understand the context of the subsequent chapters. In the second chapter, the criticism on <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> action is introduced, followed by the different proposals presented in the doctrine on what the test to assess <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> should be. After this follows an attempt to systematize the case-law, and last an assessment of whether the different tests proposed by the doctrine match the case-law. The last chapter discusses the enforcement of the prohibition on <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing.</b> The findings of the research are that there should be more of a focus in the doctrine on systematizing and improving the case-law, instead of purely de lege ferenda research focusing on the problems with enforcement. There seems to be a consensus on that enforcement is reasonable in certain exceptional cases where the market is unlikely to correct itself within a reasonable timeframe, and this is what should be focused on. This research shows that the CJEU currently accepts several different tests, with varying burdens of proof. It is suggested that this is not ideal from the point of view of legal certainty, and that the different tests should be brought closer to each other. The research also shows that there are still a number of fundamental questions unanswered by the CJEU, such as what costs are relevant for the assessment, whether the tests should revolve around an as-efficient competitor and whether demand factors are relevant in all cases or only in the so-called Lucazeau test, named after case Lucazeau (Joined cases 110 / 88, 241 / 88 and 242 / 88). The research also shows that there are many possible remedies for the Commission to use in a case of <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing,</b> and that the presumption should not be that <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> enforcement always would amount to price regulation. It is further noted that the Commission’s reticence to bring cases concerning <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> might be misplaced, as the rise in such actions by national competition authorities indicates a need for clarity in the currently inconsistent case-law. A recent alarming development is also observed, whereby the Commission might be trying to circumvent its high burden of proof through Commitment decisions...|$|R

40|$|Following the 2007 Sector Inquiry {{into the}} energy sector, the EU Commission has {{actively}} enforced Article 102 TFEU to sanction {{different forms of}} abuse of dominance by energy operators. Most of the cases have been concluded via commitments decisions which mainly included far-reaching structural (i. e. divestiture of capacity) rather than behavioural remedies. Moreover, in its commitment decisions the EU Commission has mainly targeted exclusionary conducts by energy undertakings, rather than directly sanctioning the <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> in the wholesale and retail markets as exploitative abuses of dominance. Unlike the EU Commission, the National Competition Authorities (NCAs) of the EU Member States have directly sanctioned <b>excessive</b> <b>pricing</b> both at the wholesale and retail level as exploitative abuses of dominance. In particular, a number of NCAs have sanctioned withdrawals of capacity by electricity generators as abuses of dominance, since such conduct caused a direct rise of wholesale electricity prices. Secondly, NCAs {{of a number of}} EU Member States have also sanctioned the <b>excessive</b> <b>prices</b> in the retail energy markets imposed by undertakings on final customers. Besides the different focus in the enforcement of Article 102 TFEU in the energy markets in comparison to the EU Commission, the NCAs have mostly opted for imposition of fines on the sanctioned undertakings, rather than imposing structural remedies via commitment decisions. The chapter aims to analyse the enforcement trends of Article 102 TFEU by the NCAs with regard to <b>excessive</b> <b>prices</b> applied by energy operators in the wholesale and retail markets. In particular, the chapter compares such pattern of enforcement with that followed by the EU Commission in this sector during the past few years.
