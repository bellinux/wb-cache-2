5|$|At 2:15 pm on 1July 1965, {{one of the}} two-car yellow trains {{lost control}} while {{approaching}} the lower terminus and ran {{off the end of}} the rails before smashing <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building.</b> The driver, 74-year-old Ernest Brown, was trapped in the cab and suffered pelvic injuries, while a number of passengers suffered minor injuries. Although the station was repaired and services were resumed, Pleasurama decided to close the line {{at the end of the}} 1965 holiday season. Services stopped on 26September 1965.|$|E

Realising Vesper has stolen it, Bond pursues her and her clients <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>{{building}}.</b> The building is damaged in the struggle and begins to sink into the Grand Canal, with Vesper trapped inside. Bond kills Vesper's clients and attempts to save her, but she refuses his attempts and drowns. White, watching nearby, walks away with the money.|$|E
5|$|By the 20th century Fleet Street and {{the area}} {{surrounding}} it were dominated by the national press and related industries. The Daily Express relocated to No.121–8 Fleet Street in 1931, <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> designed by Sir Owen Williams. It was the first curtain wall building in London. It has survived {{the departure of the}} newspaper in 1989 and was restored in 2001. The Daily Telegraph was based at No.135–142. These premises are both Grade II Listed. In the 1930s, No.67 housed 25 separate publications; by this time the majority of British households bought a daily paper produced from Fleet Street.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins with}} Dutch (Adam Baldwin), Romeo (Nolan North), and Mickey (Alan Tudyk) {{discussing}} the Covenant ship above New Mombasa, with the Rookie asleep nearby. Buck (Nathan Fillion) arrives and introduces Dare (Tricia Helfer). Romeo wakes the Rookie {{and the team}} enter their HEVs and drop through the atmosphere; at the last minute, Dare changes their trajectory to miss the ship. The Covenant ship enters slipspace, sending a shockwave toward the ODSTs; the Rookie's pod collides with Mickey's and crashes <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> on the ground, knocking him unconscious for six hours. He awakens and proceeds to find clues {{as to what happened}} to his squadmates.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Calderon, Emily's {{doctor who}} works for a company called Prangen, refuses to {{transfer}} Emily's medical records to the County Children's Center, prompting Mulder to rough him up, but has to leave when security arrives. Later, Mulder follows Calderon after he leaves his office. Scully has imaging tests conducted on Emily. Calderon goes to see the Dark Suited Men, one of whom kills him by stabbing him in the neck with an alien stiletto; both men then morph into Calderon. Mulder follows as one of them leaves. The results of Emily's tests show her to be suffering from a tumorous infection. The other Calderon arrives at the hospital and injects Emily with an unknown green substance; he escapes by morphing into someone else. Scully believes that he is continuing the treatments, and the Sims were murdered because they were trying to stop him. Mulder follows the first Calderon clone <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building,</b> where he meets Anna Fugazzi, an elderly woman in a nursing home.|$|E
5|$|Desperate Housewives {{focuses on}} the lives of several {{residents}} on the suburban neighborhood of Wisteria Lane. In recent episodes, Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher) has encouraged a stripper Robin Gallagher (Julie Benz) to quit her job and turn her life around. Susan invited Robin to move into her house until she gets back on her feet. Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany) has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital after suffering a mental breakdown stemming from the breakup of her relationship with Mike Delfino (James Denton), who has since married Susan. Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan) has recently learned that his wife, Bree Van de Kamp (Marcia Cross), {{was having an affair with}} Susan's ex-husband Karl Mayer (Richard Burgi). Orson has been using a wheelchair since Christmas, as a result of a small passenger plane crash landing <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> he and Karl were inside; Karl died as a result of the accident. Angie (Drea de Matteo) and Nick Bolen (Jeffrey Nordling) recently moved onto Wisteria Lane to escape circumstances that are yet to be fully explained; however, Gabrielle (Eva Longoria) and Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira) overheard the Bolens arguing about their circumstances, and have grown concerned about their niece Ana (Maiara Walsh) dating the Bolens' son, Danny (Beau Mirchoff).|$|E

5|$|In 1966, Stanford University student Bill Pitts, {{who had a}} hobby of {{exploring}} the steam tunnels and buildings of the campus, broke <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> he found {{out to be the}} location of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project, which held a DEC PDP-6 time-sharing computer system with 20 Teletype consoles connected to it. Fascinated by the computer and having taken several introductory computer classes, Pitts convinced the head of the project, Lester Earnest, to let him use the computer after hours. Soon, Pitts had ceased going to classes, instead spending his nights in the computer lab interacting with the graduate and postgraduate students and playing Spacewar on the PDP-6. Pitts often played against Hugh Tuck, a student at California Polytechnic State University who was a friend from high school. During one Spacewar session that took place, depending on the source, between 1966 and 1969, Tuck remarked that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was still unfeasible due to the cost of computers, and the pair did not pursue the project. In 1971, however, Pitts, who by then had graduated and was working at Lockheed as a PDP-10 programmer, learned of the 1970 DEC PDP-11, which was sold for around US$14,000. While this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most electronic games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, Tuck and Pitts felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing.|$|E
25|$|Moisture may ascend <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> {{from the}} {{foundation}} of a wall or gain ingress <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> from a wet patch of ground, where it meets a solid wall. The manifest result of this process is called damp. One of many methods of resisting such ingresses of water is to construct the wall with several low courses of dense engineering bricks such as Staffordshire blue bricks. This method of damp proofing appears as a distinctive navy blue band running around the circumference of a building. The efficacy of this means of keeping out damp is more limited by the permeability of the mortar bedding and perpends joining the bricks, than by that of the bricks themselves.|$|E
25|$|Architectural doors have {{numerous}} {{general and}} specialized uses. Doors are generally used to separate interior spaces (closets, rooms, etc.) for convenience, privacy, safety, and security reasons. Doors {{are also used}} to secure passages <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> from the exterior, for reasons of climate control and safety.|$|E

25|$|Burglary (also called {{breaking}} and entering and sometimes housebreaking) is an unlawful entry <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> or other location {{for the purposes of}} committing an offence. Usually that offence is theft, but most jurisdictions include others within the ambit of burglary. To engage in the act of burglary is to burgle (in British English) or to burglarize (in American English).|$|E
50|$|Electric pencil {{sharpeners}} {{were introduced in}} 1940. They work on the same principle as manual ones, but the cylindrical cutter is (or cutters are) rotated by an electric motor.

25|$|Under Scots law, {{the crime}} of {{burglary}} does not exist. Instead theft by housebreaking covers theft where {{the security of the}} building is overcome. It does not include any other aspect of burglary found in England and Wales. It is a crime usually prosecuted under solemn procedure in a superior court. Another common law crime still used is Hamesuken, which covers forced entry <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> where a serious assault on the occupant takes place. Common law crimes in Scotland are gradually being replaced by statutes.|$|E
25|$|Penn Jillette {{has stated}} that those being {{interview}}ed know what show the interview is for and its purpose. One episode shows a video crew from the show going <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> to perform an interview, and Jillette points out that {{a member of the}} crew is wearing a Penn & Teller: Bullshit! baseball cap. Opponents are then interviewed and they offer rebuttals to the proponents' arguments. These are usually experts, celebrities, or sometimes speakers from the Center for Inquiry, the James Randi Educational Foundation, or the Cato Institute.|$|E
25|$|Ludwig Persius, {{the court}} architect, turned the king's {{sketches}} <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> {{and put his}} colleague, Ferdinand von Arnim, {{in charge of the}} construction process. The church extends into the water and gives the impression of an actual ship anchored near the lakeshore. This design took up a third of the actual overall construction cost of 45,234 thalers and 27 silver grosch. Sacrow Manor was used as the church's parsonage. Construction began in 1841, and the church's festive dedication took place three years later on July 21, 1844.|$|E
50|$|A {{whole house}} fan {{is a type}} of fan, or exhaust system {{commonly}} venting <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building's</b> attic, designed to circulate air in <b>a</b> home or <b>building.</b> It is sometimes confused with a powered attic ventilator, which exhausts hot air from the attic to the outside through an opening in the roof or gable at a low velocity.|$|R

25|$|Edwin Lutyens, who from 1912 {{laid out}} New Delhi {{as the new}} seat of {{government}} for the British Empire in India, designed a Delhi Order having a capital displaying a band of vertical ridges, and with bells hanging at each corner {{as a replacement for}} volutes. His design for the new city's central palace, Viceroy's House, now the Presidential residence Rashtrapati Bhavan, was a thorough integration of elements of Indian architecture <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> of classical forms and proportions, and made use of the order throughout. The Delhi Order reappears in some later Lutyens buildings including Campion Hall, Oxford.|$|E
25|$|Their {{journals}} documented {{their plan}} for a major bombing to rival that of the Oklahoma City bombing. Their entries contained blurbs about ways to escape to Mexico, hijacking an aircraft at Denver International Airport and crashing it <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building</b> in New York City (foreshadowing the September 11 attacks by two years), and details about the planned attack. The pair hoped that, after detonating their home-made explosives in the cafeteria at the busiest time of day, killing hundreds of students, they would shoot survivors fleeing from the school. Then, as police vehicles, ambulances, fire trucks, and reporters came to the school, bombs set in the boys' cars would detonate, killing these emergency and other personnel. That did not happen, since these explosives did not detonate.|$|E
25|$|Manex also handled {{creature}} effects, such as Sentinels {{and machines}} {{in real world}} scenes; Animal Logic created the code hallway and the exploding Agent {{at the end of}} the film. DFilm managed scenes that required heavy use of digital compositing, such as Neo's jump off a skyscraper and the helicopter crash <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>building.</b> The ripple effect in the latter scene was created digitally, but the shot also included practical elements, and months of extensive research were needed to find the correct kind of glass and explosives to use. The scene was shot by colliding a quarter-scale helicopter mock-up into a glass wall wired to concentric rings of explosives; the explosives were then triggered in sequence from the center outward, to create a wave of exploding glass.|$|E
