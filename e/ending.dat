5|$|The {{game has}} two endings, a good <b>ending</b> {{and a bad}} <b>ending.</b> The good <b>ending</b> can only be {{achieved}} by completing secret minigames, in which various animatronic characters bring a cake to {{what seems to be}} a sorrowful child's soul. This <b>ending</b> is thought to imply that the souls of the murdered children have been set free, although connoted meanings are disputed.|$|E
5|$|This <b>ending</b> was the {{favourite}} {{amongst the}} actors. Mangan {{said that the}} alternative <b>ending</b> was the best moment {{in the whole of}} Green Wing. However, the alternative <b>ending</b> was rejected and the writers favoured the <b>ending</b> that was eventually broadcast. It is believed that the alternative <b>ending</b> would have been broadcast if a third series was being made, as that <b>ending</b> was much more ambiguous, since Alan and Joanna are still seen alive and Mac tells Caroline that he still has something to say.|$|E
5|$|Two endings {{were created}} for the special. The {{alternative}} <b>ending</b> is included on the DVD release of Green Wing, along with deleted scenes from the episode. The alternative <b>ending</b> was planned to be used if a third series {{was going to be}} commissioned, as this <b>ending</b> was much more ambiguous. It is known that the actors wanted the alternative <b>ending,</b> but after some debate, it was not shown.|$|E

5|$|After filming was complete, test {{screenings}} were held, and {{the production}} team became aware of {{a problem with the}} <b>ending.</b> In the original <b>ending,</b> Ru'afo is ejected into space from the Son'a collector ship and de-ages rapidly as he floats amongst the rings of the planet Ba'ku. The revised <b>ending</b> saw the Enterprise swoop in at the last minute to save Picard and destroy the collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. The studio liked the new <b>ending</b> but wanted a bigger space battle. The production team agreed providing they could postpone the release to allow enough time for this. Because the studio wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the <b>ending.</b>|$|E
5|$|Black Christmas {{has three}} {{alternate}} endings, {{the second of}} which {{was used as the}} actual <b>ending</b> for the UK theatrical release of the movie.

The third <b>ending</b> is similar, having Billy die and Kelli's parents picking her up, however his body disappears and the last shot shows someone moving through the vents, indicating that either Agnes or Billy are still alive. The first <b>ending,</b> which follows the original script, ends with both Kelli and Leigh surviving and Kelli getting a call from someone using Kyle's cellphone.|$|E
40|$|G. Enderlein named {{many new}} {{blackfly}} taxa. Types of European species group names were examined. Lectotypes (LT) were designated, also for several senior synonyms described by other authors, e. g., Friederichs and Lundstroem. The true identity of S. pallipes Fries, 1824, was established. Only few of Enderlein's names are valid, {{many more are}} synonyms of taxa named by other authors.
