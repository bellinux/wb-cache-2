40|$|This paper {{presents}} a survey concerning {{some of the}} most <b>important</b> <b>APIs</b> (Application Programming Interfaces) for Myrinet and SCI networks, which are widely used in the context of cluster computing. The related APIs are comparatively analyzed. This text is not supposed to be a programming manual; the analysis takes into account the APIs' functionality and programming facilities. Keywords: APIs, Cluster Computing, Message Passing Programming, Shared Memory Programming, Myrinet, SCI. 1. INTRODUCTION Clusters of PCs with high-speed networks are emerging as an economical alternative to dedicated parallel computers and, accordingly, questions regarding their programmability have become increasingly important to resolve. Recent advances in the interconnection technology have provided clusters with a very attractive cost-performance ratio. As a natural consequence of the mentioned situation, a question arises: which is the most suitable paradigm for programming clusters of PCs or workstati [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{comprises}} different projects {{within the}} scope of public health. In detail, they all aim at combating the high-burden diseases HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis more effectively. Since there was, and still is, no harmonization between the existing biowaiver guidelines, the biowaiver dissolution test conditions by WHO and FDA were compared against each other using drug products, which had already demonstrated BE to the comparator in vivo. Thereby it could be shown that the dissolution conditions proposed by the WHO are more appropriate for granting biowaivers than those of the FDA. Further, the applicability of the WHO dissolution test conditions was investigated using the APIs ethambutol, isoniazid and pyrazinamide (all BCS Class III) as model compounds. These investigations demonstrated that the concept of the biowaiver proved to work properly, i. e. leading to no false positive BE decision and an acceptable incidence of false negative BE decisions. In addition, four new biowaiver monographs were published addressing <b>important</b> <b>APIs</b> in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and malaria. Before these efforts, there were only a very few biowaiver monographs available for antiviral or antimalarial APIs, i. e. the database of biowaiver monographs has been clearly improved. The last part of the present work dealt with the extension of the biowaiver concept to related areas such as the WHO Prequalification of Medicines Programme. Investigations revealed that the biowaiver tools are generally eligible for prequalification of drug products containing ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, or lamivudine to prove BE between an appropriate comparator and the test candidate. By contrast, some APIs are excluded from the biowaiver procedure. In conclusion, the implementation of the biowaiver tools for prequalification of biowaivable APIs is, along with BCS-based biowaiver approval of new generics, an important step towards making essential, high-quality drug products more cost-effective and, as a consequence, more accessible for a larger percentage of the population. In that way, the treatment conditions for those in need living in the developing countries can be improved enormously, so that those who are poor do not have to receive poor treatment. The quality standard of essential medicines will increase worldwide, thereby helping to combat the high-burden diseases better and, in turn, lead to an improvement of the global health status...|$|E
40|$|Varroasis {{is caused}} by the {{parasitic}} mite Varroa jacobsoni Oud. and is a very <b>important</b> pathology for <b>Apis</b> mellifera. This disease was restricted to the Asian South-East {{until the end of the}} fifties; nevertheless, during the last decades it rapidly spread, becoming in a short time a world-wide problem for apiculture. In this paper the existing data concerning varroasis and Varroa jacobsoni are reviewed; the biological and, in particular, reproductive aspects of the mite are considered. Furthermore, the antiparasitic methods and perspectives useful to oppose disease expansion are examined...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Worldwide, {{evidence}} suggests that exotic pollinators can disrupt plant mating patterns. However, few studies have determined if pollination by the honeybee Apis mellifera (the world 2 ̆ 7 s most widely introduced pollinator) reduces offspring quality when compared with pollination by native birds. The Australian Proteaceae provide an excellent opportunity to test the impact of honeybees in pollination systems that are adapted to birds and non-flying mammals. Methods: We compared the frequency of flower visitation and foraging behaviour of birds and insects within seven populations of Banksia ericifolia. Banksia ericifolia is hermaphroditic and has large nectar-rich, orange inflorescences typical of bird and mammal pollinated species. For {{a subset of the}} study populations, we compared the quality of seed produced via an exclusion treatment (that only allowed invertebrates to access flowers) with an open-pollination treatment (potentially visited by mammals, birds and invertebrates), by measuring seed weight, germination rates (T 50), percent germination, seedling height after 14 days since the emergence of the cotyledon and time to emergence of the cotyledon. <b>Important</b> Findings: <b>Apis</b> mellifera was the only apparent insect pollinator and the most frequent flower visitor, while the open treatment inflorescences were also frequently visited by avian pollinators, primarily honeyeater species. The foraging behaviour of honeybees and honeyeaters showed striking differences that potentially affect patterns of pollen transfer. Honeybees made significantly greater proportions of within cf. among plant movements and only 30...|$|R
40|$|Varroa {{destructor}} is {{the most}} <b>important</b> ectoparasite of <b>Apis</b> mellifera. This review addresses the interactions between the varroa mite, its environment, and the honey bee host, mediated by an impressive number of cues and signals, including semiochemicals regulating crucial steps of the mite's life cycle. Although mechanical stimuli, temperature, and humidity play an important role, chemical communication {{is the most}} important channel. Kairomones are used at all stages of the mite's life cycle, and the exploitation of bees' brood pheromones is particularly significant given these compounds function as primer and releaser signals that regulate the social organization of the honey bee colony. V. destructor is a major problem for apiculture and the search for novel control methods is an essential task for researchers. A detailed study of the ecological interactions of V. destructor is a prerequisite for creating strategies to sustainably manage the parasite. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Entomology Volume 61 is January 07, 2016. Please see [URL] for revised estimates...|$|R
40|$|Resistance of Nosema ceranae to {{different}} exposure conditions has been evaluated by using Sytox green and DAPI (4, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole) to test spore viability. High thermotolerance at 60 and 35 °C {{and resistance to}} desiccation were observed. However, {{a significant decrease in}} viability after freezing and a rapid degeneration of spores maintained at 4 °C were also detected. Two Nosema species have been related to pathology in the honeybee: Nosema apis (18) a parasite of Apis mellifera, the western honeybee, and Nosema ceranae (4), a parasite of Apis cerana, the eastern honeybee. Currently, however, N. ceranae is considered an emergent and <b>important</b> parasite of <b>Apis</b> mellif-era (4). Over the last few years, an increase in infections by this microsporidian has been detected in several European coun-tries, together with an increase in honeybee colony deaths and a consequent decrease in the production of honey (9). How-ever, it is not clear if N. ceranae infection may be the onl...|$|R
40|$|Transgenic insect-resistant cotton (Bt cotton) {{has been}} {{extensively}} planted in China, but its effects on non-targeted insect species such as the economically <b>important</b> honey bee (<b>Apis</b> mellifera) and silkworm (Bombyx mori) currently are unknown. In this study, pollen from two Bt cotton cultivars, one expressing Cry 1 Ac/EPSPS and the other expressing Cry 1 Ac/Cry 2 Ab, were {{used to evaluate the}} effects of Bt cotton on adult honey bees and silkworm larvae. Laboratory feeding studies showed no adverse effects on the survival, cumulative consumption, and total hemocyte count (THC) of A. mellifera fed with Bt pollen for 7 days. No effects on the survival or development of B. mori larvae were observed either. A marginally significant difference between Cry 1 Ac/Cry 2 Ab cotton and the conventional cotton on the THC of the 3 (rd) day of 5 (th) B. mori instar larvae was observed only at the two highest pollen densities (approximately 900 and 8000 grains/cm(2)), which are much higher than the pollen deposition that occurs under normal field conditions. The results of this study show that pollen of the tested Bt cotton varieties carried no lethal or sublethal risk for A. mellifera, and the risk for B. mori was negligible...|$|R
40|$|The ecologically and {{economic}} <b>important</b> honey bee (<b>Apis</b> mellifera) {{is a key}} non-target arthropod species in environmental risk assessment (ERA) of genetically modified (GM) crops. Honey bee larvae are directly exposed to transgenic products by the consumption of GM pollen. But most ERA studies only consider responses of adult bees, although Bt-proteins primarily affect the larval phases of target organisms. We adopted an in vitro larvae rearing system, to assess lethal and sublethal effects of Bt-pollen consumption in a standardized eco-toxicological bioassay. The effects of pollen from two Bt-maize cultivars, one expressing a single {{and the other a}} total of three Bt-proteins, on the survival and prepupae weight of honey bee larvae were analyzed. The control treatments included pollen from three non-transgenic maize varieties and of Heliconia rostrata. Three days old larvae were fed the realistic exposure dose of 2 mg pollen within the semi-artificial diet. The larvae were monitored over 120 h, until the prepupal stage, where larvae terminate feeding and growing. Neither single nor stacked Bt-maize pollen showed an adverse effect on larval survival and the prepupal weight. In contrast, feeding of H. rostrata pollen caused significant toxic effects. The results {{of this study indicate that}} pollen of the tested Bt-varieties does not harm the development of in vitro reared A. mellifera larvae. To sustain the ecosystem service of pollination, Bt-impact on A. mellifera should always be a crucial part of regulatory biosafety assessments. We suggest that our approach of feeding GM pollen on in vitro reared honey bee larvae is well suited of becoming a standard bioassay in regulatory risk assessment...|$|R
