Routine postoperative prophylactic {{administration of}} vitamin <b>D</b> <b>or</b> metabolites and calcium {{reduce the incidence}} of symptomatic hypocalcaemia; this article reports evaluating its cost-effectiveness in Colombia. Methods Meta-analysis was used for comparing the administration of vitamin <b>D</b> <b>or</b> metabolites to oral calcium or no treatment at all in patients following total thyroidectomy and a cost-effectiveness analysis was designed based on a decision-tree model with local costs. Results The OR value for the comparison between calcitriol and calcium compared to no treatment and to exclusive calcium treatment groups was 0. 32 (0. 13 - 0. 79 95 %CI) and 0. 31 (0. 14 - 0. 70 95 %CI), respectively.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) candidate gene: potassium voltage-gated channel, KQT-like subfamily, member 1 (KCNQ 1) {{was suggested}} by conducting a genome wide association study (GWAS) in Japanese population. Association {{studies have been}} replicated among East Asian populations; however, the association between this gene and T 2 D in Southeast Asian populations {{still needs to be}} studied. This study aimed to investigate the association of KCNQ 1 common variants with type 2 diabetes in Malaysian Malay subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The KCNQ 1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) : rs 2237892, rs 2283228, and rs 2237895 were genotyped in 234 T 2 D and 177 normal Malay subjects. RESULTS: The risk allele of the rs 2283228 (A) was strongly associated with T 2 <b>D</b> (<b>OR</b> = 1. 7, P = 0. 0006) while the rs 2237892 (C) was moderately associated with T 2 <b>D</b> (<b>OR</b> = 1. 45, P = 0. 017). The recessive genetic models showed that rs 2283228 was strongly associated with T 2 <b>D</b> (<b>OR</b> = 2. 35, P = 0. 00005) whereas rs 2237892 showed a moderate association with T 2 <b>D</b> (<b>OR</b> = 1. 69, P = 0. 01). The haplotype block (TCA), which contained the protective allele, correlated with a protection from T 2 <b>D</b> (<b>OR</b> = 0. 5, P = 0. 003). Furthermore, the diplotype (CAA-TCA) that contained the protective haplotype was protected against T 2 <b>D</b> (<b>OR</b> = 0. 46, P = 0. 006). CONCLUSION: The KCNQ 1 SNPs, haplotypes and diplotypes are associated with T 2 D in the Malaysian Malay subjects...|$|R
