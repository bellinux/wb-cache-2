40|$|AbstractThe {{main stream}} of the Yangtze River, Dongting Lake, {{and the river}} network in the Jingjiang reach of the Yangtze River {{constitute}} a complex water system. This paper develops a one-dimensional (1 -D) mathematical model for flood routing in the river network of the Jingjiang River and Dongting Lake using the explicit finite volume method. Based on observed data during the flood periods in 1996 and 1998, the model was calibrated and validated, and {{the results show that}} the model is effective and has high accuracy. In addition, the one-dimensional mathematical model for the river network and the horizontal two-dimensional (2 -D) mathematical model for the Jingjiang flood <b>diversion</b> <b>area</b> were coupled to simulate the flood process in the Jingjiang River, Dongting Lake, and the Jingjiang flood <b>diversion</b> <b>area.</b> The calculated results of the coupled model are consistent with the practical processes. Meanwhile, the results show that the flood diversion has significant effects on the decrease of the peak water level at the Shashi and Chenjiawan hydrological stations near the flood diversion gates, and the effect is more obvious in the downstream than in the upstream...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Focusing on 2 -D (2. 5 D) {{dimensional}} geographical phenomena, traditional commercial GISs {{have limited}} capability {{of dealing with}} 3 -D and 4 -D environmental data and models.

40|$|International audienceFlooding due to rivers {{overflowing}} {{have affected}} this year {{many countries in}} the world. The engendered problems, due to their intensity, are relative to goods and persons safety, and often cause a sharp increase of the insurance costs, which is no more tolerable in the actual economic context. To prevent these problems, {{it is necessary to}} limit water heights downstream the streams. In the literature, numerous described works were done on flows modelling and management. The work presented in this paper, is interested in the quantitative management by means of floods diversion areas placed along the river and for which location and sizing are known. A management method computing the height of gates opening at each time step is proposed. The strategy is based on a transportation network model of the flood <b>diversion</b> <b>area</b> system including the time transfer delays.

50|$|To protect other dams from failure, several flood <b>diversion</b> <b>areas</b> were {{evacuated}} and inundated, and several dams were deliberately destroyed by air strikes to release water in desired directions. The Nihewa and Laowangpo flood <b>diversion</b> <b>areas</b> downstream of the dams soon exceeded their capacity {{and gave up}} part of their storage on August 8, forcing more flood <b>diversion</b> <b>areas</b> to begin to evacuate. The dikes on the Quan River collapsed in the evening of August 9, and the entire Linquan county in Fuyang, Anhui was inundated. As the Boshan Dam, with a capacity of 400 million m3, crested and the water released from the failures of Banqiao and Shimantan was rushing downstream, air strikes were made against several other dams to protect the Suya Lake dam, already holding 1.2 billion m3 of water. Suya Lake won only a temporary reprieve, as both it and Boshan became eventual targets. Finally, the Bantai Dam, holding 5.7 billion m3 of water, was bombed.|$|R

40|$|The {{risk from}} natural {{disasters}} is an {{integration of the}} factors (parameters) of hazard and vulnerability. Population growth in disaster-prone areas in conjunction with socioeconomic development and environmental changes results to the increasing severity of impacts of natural disasters. Worldwide statistics show that flood events are not only increasing {{but the number of}} people killed by floods and the associated socioeconomic losses are also rising. It is, therefore, essential to find adaptive solutions for flood risk reduction in flood-prone areas. Comprehensive flood risk mapping can be applied as one of non-structural measures for that purpose. This paper presented an integrated approach to flood risk mapping for flood detention areas with the case study of the Day River Flood <b>Diversion</b> <b>Area</b> (DRFDA) in the Red River Delta (RRD), Viet Nam. The comprehensive food risk maps were developed based on the integration of impact parameters of flood hazard and flood vulnerability. Flood hazard was an integration of hazard-related indicators such as depth, duration and velocity of floodwater, whereas flood vulnerability was a combination of economic, social, and environmental aspects. The economic vulnerability to flood was estimated based on land-uses such as residentia...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, an {{important}} development in flood management {{has been the}} focal shift from flood protection towards flood risk management. This change greatly promoted the progress of flood control research in a multidisciplinary way. Moreover, given the growing complexity and uncertainty in many decision situations of flood risk management, traditional methods, e. g., tight-coupling integration {{of one or more}} quantitative models, are not enough to provide decision support for managers. Within this context, this paper presents a beneficial methodological framework to enhance the effectiveness of decision support systems, through the dynamic adaptation of support regarding the needs of the decision-maker. In addition, we illustrate a loose-coupling technical prototype for integrating heterogeneous elements, such as multi-source data, multidisciplinary models, GIS tools and existing systems. The main innovation is the application of model-driven concepts, which put the system in a state of continuous iterative optimization. We define the new system as a model-driven decision support system (MDSS). Two characteristics that differentiate the MDSS are as follows: (1) it is made accessible to non-technical specialists; and (2) it has a higher level of adaptability and compatibility. Furthermore, the MDSS was employed to manage the flood risk in the Jingjiang flood <b>diversion</b> <b>area,</b> located in central China near the Yangtze River. Compared with traditional solutions, we believe that this model-driven method is efficient, adaptable and flexible, and thus has bright prospects of application for comprehensive flood risk management...|$|E

The Xin'anjiang model is used to forecast the flood discharge hydrograph of the upstream and tributary. The flood routing of the main channel and flood diversion areas is based on the Muskingum method. The water stage of the downstream boundary condition is calculated with the water stage simulating hydrologic method and the water stages of each cross section are calculated from downstream to upstream with the diffusion wave nonlinear water stage method. The input flood discharge hydrograph from the main channel to the flood <b>diversion</b> <b>area</b> is estimated with the fixed split ratio of the main channel discharge. The flood flow inside the flood retarding area is calculated as a reservoir with the water balance method. The faded-memory forgetting factor least square of error series is used as the real-time error correction method for forecasting discharge and water stage. As an example, the combined models were applied to flood forecasting and regulation of {{the upper reaches of the}} Huai River above Lutaizi during the 2007 flood season. The forecast achieves a high accuracy and the results show that the combined models provide a scientific way of flood forecasting and regulation for a complex watershed with flood diversion and retarding areas...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between cultural, social and psychological background and the uses and gratifications associated with mass media among a sample of 90 Muslim adolescents and a matched group of 81 white British youths from a small, industrial Yorkshire town. The sample was aged between 11 - 16 years. The Muslim youths were shown to attend to both print and cinema more than white British youths, and the white youths demonstrated a higher use of television. Print media were associated with a wider range of functions among the Muslim youths compared to the white youths and television was shown to fill a wider range of functions among the white youths. An explanation resting on the cultural bias in the available content on these media, and previous associations with these was suggested as accounting for these differences. Four gratification areas were associated with both samples' use of television; these were: personal identity seeking, learning about life and the world, social utility and family integration, and diversion with associated areas of para-social interaction and escape. The area of learning about life and the world accounted for the major proportion of variance among the Muslim sample's endorsements; the <b>diversion</b> <b>area</b> accounted for the major proportion of variance among the white sample's endorsements. A fourfold classification scheme using parent/peer orientation and ethnic group evaluation was proposed in order to predict media use and television gratification seeking. Among both samples, personal identity seeking was shown to be associated with interpersonal and identity conflict. On the whole, the fourfold classification was shown to have greater predictive ability in describing the 'Muslim sample's media behaviours. The strongest correlates of gratifications associated with television viewing were examined in separate sample regression analyses. Muslim sample solutions suggested that the proportion of one's life spent in Britain, ethnic identification, relations with parents and peers, and attitudes towards religion were most important in explaining television gratification. Among white youths willingness to approach various groups of individuals and identification variables contributed most towards explaining television gratifications...|$|E

For this goal, {{it is necessary to}} proceed to the dimensioning of the river system capacity and to make sure of its management by taking into account socio-economic and environmental constraints. The use of flood <b>diversion</b> <b>areas</b> on a river has for main interest to protect inhabited downstream areas. In this paper, a flood lamination strategy aiming at deforming the wave of flood at the entrance of the zone to be protected is presented. A transportation network modeling and a flow optimization method are proposed. The flow optimization method, is based on the modeling of a Min-Cost-Max-flow problem with a linear programming formulation. The optimization algorithm used in this method is the interior-point algorithm which allows a relaxation of the solution of the problem and avoids some non feasibility cases due to the use of constraints based on real data. For a forecast horizon corresponding to the flood episode, the management method of the flood volumes is evaluated on a 2 D simulator of a river equipped with a three-flood-diversion- area system. Performances show the effectiveness of the method and its ability to manage flood lamination with efficient water storage...|$|R
40|$|The Vu Gia – Thu Bon River Basin {{in central}} Vietnam {{is subject to}} {{extensive}} hydropower development, with eight major and at least 34 minor hydropower installations planned for completion over the next 10 years.

Given the current high levels of exploitation, the fish fauna appeared surprisingly intact; however, a number of attributes of the fauna, such as the prevalence of migration as a life-history tactic, make this fauna particularly vulnerable to the impacts of hydropower development. Without extensive mitigation, the combinations of habitat alteration in dam and <b>diversion</b> <b>areas</b> and the imposition of a proliferation of barriers to migration will lead to severe population fragmentation, increasing the potential for local extinction, and severely compromise opportunities for recolonisation...|$|R

ResultsA total of 8, 728 data points together with their corresponding ambulance diversion status were analyzed. The ED occupancy rate was found to be moderate associated with ambulance <b>diversion</b> status (<b>area</b> under curve, AUC = 0. 84, p = 0. 004). When the sensitivity was fixed at 91 %, the specificity was 60 % and the corresponding ED occupancy rate was 1. 25.

40|$|PS 10. 8 Management {{of water}} resources: Urban water managementThe {{presentation}} {{will look at}} 'water stories' in global cities, most of them coastal, rich and relatively wet. In these largely 'mature' water economies, per capita use has usually begun to decline or at least level out, although the causes are not clear. Yet provision costs have not declined commensurately, often generating a conservation-driven budgetary crisis that forces institutional change, including moves towards full cost pricing and, sometimes, greater private sector involvement. Often complications arise from the need of megacities to reach across administrative boundaries and watersheds to secure their supply. These are common problems, but we also find that specific paths taken by urban water economies depend upon critical choices at certain tipping points and larger governance considerations beyond the water sector. Hong Kong and Singapore provide a good comparison/contrast in this regard. In terms of their 'initial conditions,' they are very similar, yet they have moved along different paths. In the early 1960 s, both Hong Kong and Singapore were British colonies, suffering from severe drought. Both looked to <b>diversions</b> from neighbouring <b>areas</b> to secure a water supply, but {{at the cost of}} political insecurity. Both sought to address this problem through commitment to greater self-provision. From the mid 1980 s, Hong Kong abandoned this strategy. In both cities, water prices have been frozen {{since the beginning of the}} 21 st century, but Singapore has covered its costs while Hong Kong has relied on subsidies.
