5|$|After {{not telling}} anyone about hitting Delia, Adam fears the {{investigation}} <b>is</b> <b>closing</b> in on him. He names Jack Connor's godfather and makes him promise {{to protect him}} should anything happen to him, and then proposes to Chelsea again and asks her to move to Paris with him, like they had planned during their first marriage. At the same time, Victor's private investigation on the hit-and-run driver leads him to Adam. He agrees to not turn him in {{as long as he}} can take part in Connor's life; a role he had initially refused him. Adam agrees as he and Chelsea remarry. Days before their flight to Paris, Delia's father Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) puts the pieces together and realizes Adam is the one who killed his daughter. He holds him at gunpoint and demands he drive them to places where milestones in Delia's life occurred. While driving, Adam attempts to grab the gun as a shot is fired and the car drives off a ravine. One of them staggers away from the crash and collapses, revealed to be Billy. Nick and Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) find the overturned vehicle as it catches fire and explodes. Adam's body is thrown from the vehicle, is not recovered and he is presumed dead, devastating Chelsea just as news that Adam killed Delia breaks. However, Adam's bloody hand is later shown to be moving, alluding that he survived. Soon after, he is shown to be lying in a bed, being held captive by an unknown captor. Later Victor informs Chelsea that his investigators have found Adam's remains, but elsewhere Adam is seen paying off Victor's investigator, confirming that Adam has faked his death.|$|E

25|$|The {{cavitation}} phenomenon {{can also}} be described using fluid mechanics. This can result from pressure oscillations, flow deceleration, tip vortices, streamline contraction, and squeeze jets. This last cause is the most contributive factor to cavitation. The squeeze jets are formed when the valve <b>is</b> <b>closing</b> and the blood between the occluder and valve housing is “squeezed” out to create a high-speed jet. This in turn creates intense vortices with very low pressures {{that can lead to}} cavitation.|$|E

The first was On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), in which Countess Tracy di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg) marries Bond but is shot dead by Irma Bunt and Ernst Stavro Blofeld at the story's end. The second was Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) in Casino Royale (2006). Bond confesses his love to her and resigns from MI6 so that they can have a normal life together. He later learns that she had been a double agent working for his enemies. The enemy {{organisation}} Quantum had kidnapped her former lover and had been blackmailing her to secure her co-operation.

25|$|The annual {{operating}} deficit {{of running the}} airport had reached $300,000 per year, $130,000 of it in operating the Maple City ferry. The City of Toronto decided to ask the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada to cover the deficit. Despite the deficit, {{and in the absence}} of a subsidy, the joint committee studying the airport recommended to the Harbour Commission to keep it open. The report outlined three options: keep it open as <b>is,</b> <b>closing</b> it and use the land for other uses (which would mean finding a location for the 140,000 takeoffs and landings elsewhere), or use it for a STOL airport. The Government of Canada agreed to grant an annual subsidy to the Harbour Commission to operate the airport, while the Government of Ontario agreed to pay for the costs of the airport ferry. The Government of Canada put a condition on the subsidy, that intergovernmental agreement needed to be reached on the future of the airport.|$|E
25|$|The gap {{caused by}} the digital divide in China is {{beginning}} to close. The percentage of the Chinese population using the internet has been increasing dramatically each year. In the year 2000 only 1.7 percent of the Chinese population were internet users. By 2010 that percentage had increased to 31.6 percent of the population. This data shows that the gap separating China {{and the rest of}} the world <b>is</b> <b>closing.</b> However, the digital divide among Chinese citizens remains strong. Many Chinese citizens are faced with the issues of the digital divide because of their income, education, or location. While China has made great strides in improving the country's communication infrastructure as well as narrowing the overall digital divide, there remains a divide between urban and rural areas of the country. This divide between rural and urban, developed and under developed, is illustrated in the lack of ICTs between the western (i.e., Xinjiang province) and eastern (i.e., Jiangsu province) parts of the country.|$|E

Ned is horrified to hear that humans evolved from apes and that the creation account in the Genesis is characterized as a myth. Covering his children's eyes, he drags them out of the exhibit.|$|E
500|$|At {{the scene}} of the car accident, Oswald's boss suffers an oddly timed heart attack; Oswald then saves his boss by using his {{electrical}} powers as a makeshift defibrillator, much to the paramedics' surprise. The agents question Sharon at the hospital, who claims that he told her about his powers. The agents also go through Oswald's medical records, showing that he exhibited acute hypokalemia—electrolytic imbalance in his blood. Oswald is brought in for questioning by the agents, but he proclaims his innocence and is eventually released by the skeptical, unfriendly local sheriff, much to the agents' dismay. Later, at the arcade, Zero <b>is</b> <b>closing</b> down for the night, and turns off the power. However, the Virtua Fighter 2 machine does not turn off. When Zero goes to investigate, the machine shuts off, except for the jukebox next to him (playing [...] "Hey Man, Nice Shot", a song Oswald was listening to earlier). Knowing Oswald is now hunting him, Zero runs outside and claims he did not betray Oswald to the agents; he is then suddenly struck by lightning and dies. It is then revealed that Oswald is standing on the arcade rooftop.|$|E
