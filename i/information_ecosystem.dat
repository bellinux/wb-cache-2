Therefore, facts about a thing, such as its location in time and space, have been less critical to track because the person processing the information can {{decide whether or not}} that information was important to the action being taken, and if so, add the missing information (or decide to not take the action). (Note that some things in the Internet of things will be sensors, and sensor location is usually important.) The GeoWeb and Digital Earth are promising applications that become possible when things can become organized and connected by location. However, the challenges that remain include the constraints of variable spatial scales, the need to handle massive amounts of data, and an indexing for fast search and neighbor operations. In the Internet of things, if things are able to take actions on their own initiative, this human-centric mediation role is eliminated.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of <b>information</b> <b>ecosystems</b> where there are antagonistic agents or groups of antagonistic agents. In particular, we focus on systems that consist of exploiter agents and agents being exploited. When comparing <b>information</b> <b>ecosystems</b> with biological ecosystems, {{it becomes clear that}} both types of systems seem to support robust solutions that are hard to violate by a single agent. In the analysis of <b>information</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> it is important to take into consideration that agents may have a Machiavellian intelligence, i. e., that they take the self-interest of other agents into consideration. We conclude that in the interaction between antagonistic agents within information systems, arms race is a major force. A positive result of this is a better preparedness for innocent agents against the vigilant agents. Some examples are given to show how the modelling of <b>information</b> <b>ecosystems</b> in this way can explain the origin of more robust systems when antagonistic agents are around. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{model of}} surplus values within <b>information</b> <b>ecosystems</b> is presented. The model {{is based on}} the {{classical}} definition of surplus value. However, as this definition was developed within a manufacturing industry context, some modifications are necessary to adopt it to the context of <b>information</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> e. g. by taking into account that products are "virtual" rather than physical. Just as in agent-based computational economics, here the economics is modelled as evolving systems of autonomous interacting agents in an evolutionary framework. In this way the resulting model is able to capture more dynamic scenarios. The model is formally specified in terms of price, profit, and group gaining functions and is applied to some examples of societies of selfish agents in antagonistic groups to illustrate its dynamic properties. Moreover, the paper show how the model builds upon labour theory of value and contrasts it to consumer value models...|$|R

We describe the design principles of the DIET software architecture, and present a simple example application based upon it. We go on to consider how the DIET system can be used to develop information brokering agents, and how these can contribute to the implementation of economic interactions between agents, as well as identifying some open questions relating to research in these areas. In this way we show the capacity of the DIET system to support applications using information agents...|$|E

In {{spite of the}} fact that we have sophisticated tools of communication in firms, exchange of information and knowledge in companies with a flat organizational structure are not satisfactory. It is evident that although there is very flexible and fast communication in contrast to the vertically managed organizations, we often struggle here with a great deal of information noise, loss of information and knowledge throughout the enterprise. Deficiencies in communication do not concern the core processes but mainly the support processes. These support processes are high demands on documentation and information exchange. We face here the human factor and its variety in action, which is very difficult to cultivate with organizational culture.
