5|$|<b>Flowers</b> {{are usually}} borne {{in groups of}} three—one female flower {{together}} with two male <b>flowers.</b> In some species groups of four <b>flowers</b> (two male and two female) have been reported. At {{the far end of}} the inflorescence, away from the axis of the tree, pairs of male <b>flowers</b> replace the triads of male and female <b>flowers.</b> Flower colour is poorly known. It must be recorded from live plants, since preserved <b>flowers</b> lose their colour over time, and records of these species in the wild are incomplete. Male <b>flowers</b> tend to fall into two groups—those with cream or yellow <b>flowers</b> and those with some amount of purple in the <b>flowers.</b> Female <b>flowers</b> are even less well known than male <b>flowers.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are male}} (staminate) and female (pistillate) <b>flowers</b> (unisexual <b>flowers)</b> {{on a single}} plant (monoecious), and these grow singly, {{appearing}} from the leaf axils. <b>Flowers</b> have five fused yellow to orange petals (the corolla) and a green bell-shaped calyx. Male <b>flowers</b> in Cucurbitaceae generally have five stamens, but in Cucurbita there are only three, and their anthers are joined together so that {{there appears to be}} one. Female <b>flowers</b> have thick pedicels, and an inferior ovary with 3–5 stigmas that each have two lobes. The female <b>flowers</b> of C.argyrosperma and C.ficifolia have larger corollas than the male <b>flowers.</b> Female <b>flowers</b> of C.pepo have a small calyx, but the calyx of C.moschata male <b>flowers</b> is comparatively short.|$|E
5|$|All these <b>flowers</b> are white, {{with the}} {{exception}} of Camellia sinensis which has a yellow centre, and all either have dense filaments or are formed of tight clusters of small <b>flowers.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of <b>flowers</b> {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, <b>flowers</b> communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, <b>flowers</b> attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the rewards of nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated <b>flowers</b> tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, <b>flowers</b> such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E
5|$|Banksia cuneata is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its brighter <b>flowers</b> and duller leaves. It further differs from B.ilicifolia in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, <b>flowers</b> and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes. The leaves, <b>flowers</b> and fruit of B.oligantha are smaller still, and its foliage is not as prickly as that of B.cuneata.|$|E
5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. <b>Flowers</b> {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} <b>flowers</b> within the syconium. Female <b>flowers</b> mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the <b>flowers,</b> lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the <b>flowers</b> in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male <b>flowers</b> mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male <b>flowers</b> before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next one to five days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change has}} {{affected}} plant phenology; increasing temperatures {{are associated with}} advancing first <b>flowering</b> dates. The impact on <b>flowering</b> duration, however, has rarely been studied. In this study, we analysed first <b>flowering</b> dates and <b>flowering</b> durations from a 27 year dataset of weekly <b>flower</b> observations on 232 plant species from the island of Guernsey in the English Channel. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore variation in trends and relationships between first <b>flowering</b> dates, <b>flowering</b> duration and temperature. We specifically looked for evidence that traits, such as life forms and phylogenetic groups, explained variation in sensitivity of first <b>flowering</b> and <b>flowering</b> duration among species. Overall trends revealed significantly earlier <b>flowering</b> over time, by an average of 5. 2 days decade- 1 since 1985. A highly significant shortening of <b>flowering</b> duration was observed by an average of 10 days decade- 1. Correlations between first <b>flowering,</b> <b>flowering</b> duration and year varied between different species, traits and <b>flowering</b> periods. Significant differences among traits were observed for first <b>flowering</b> and to a lesser degree for <b>flowering</b> duration. Overall, in comparison to first <b>flowering,</b> more species had significant trends in <b>flowering</b> duration. Temperature relationships revealed large differences in strength and direction of response. 55 % of the species revealed a significant negative relationship of first <b>flowering</b> dates and temperature. In contrast, only 19 % of <b>flowering</b> durations had a significant negative temperature relationship. The advance in first <b>flowering</b> date together with a shortening of <b>flowering</b> duration suggests potentially serious impacts on pollinators, which might pose a major threat to biodiversity, agriculture and horticulture. Human health, in terms of pollen allergies, however, might benefit from a shortening of specific plant pollen seasons...|$|R

5|$|Sycamore trees {{produce their}} <b>flowers</b> in hanging {{branched}} clusters known as panicles that contain {{a variety of}} different flower types. Most are morphologically bisexual, with both male and female organs, but function as if they were unisexual. Some are both morphologically and functionally male, others morphologically bisexual but function as males, and still others are morphologically bisexual but function as females. All of the flower types can produce pollen, but the pollen from functionally female <b>flowers</b> does not germinate. All <b>flowers</b> produce nectar, the functionally female <b>flowers</b> producing it in greater volume and with a higher sugar content.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} of food reflects the seasonal {{nature of the}} forests in which they live. During the hot season, fruit, <b>flowers,</b> and young leaves are more abundant, whereas the cold, wet season offers more young leaves and <b>flowers.</b> Despite this, the diet changes little between seasons, except that females will consume more high-protein, low-fiber items, such as young leaves and <b>flowers,</b> during pregnancy and lactation in order to offset the energy costs of reproduction. Nectar is only available sporadically, yet constitutes a major food source when the <b>flowers</b> bloom. The nectar of the traveller's palm (Ravenala madagascariensis) is a favorite among ruffed lemurs.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} cottage gardens {{were more}} practical than today's, {{with emphasis on}} vegetables and herbs, fruit trees, perhaps a beehive, and even livestock. <b>Flowers,</b> used to fill spaces, gradually became more dominant. The traditional cottage garden was usually enclosed, perhaps with a rose-bowered gateway. <b>Flowers</b> common to early cottage gardens included traditional florists' <b>flowers</b> such as primroses and violets, along with <b>flowers</b> with household use such as calendula and various herbs. Others were the richly scented old-fashioned roses that bloomed once a year, and simple <b>flowers</b> like daisies.

50|$|More recently, a {{mathematical}} {{explanation for the}} extreme length of the <b>flowering</b> cycles has been offered, involving both the stabilizing selection implied by the predator satiation hypothesis and others, {{and the fact that}} plants that <b>flower</b> at longer intervals tend to release more seeds. The hypothesis claims that bamboo <b>flowering</b> intervals grew by integer multiplication. A mutant bamboo plant <b>flowering</b> at a noninteger multiple of its population's <b>flowering</b> interval would release its seeds alone, and would not enjoy the benefits of collective <b>flowering</b> (such as protection from predators). However, a mutant bamboo plant <b>flowering</b> at an integer multiple of its population's <b>flowering</b> interval would release its seeds only during collective <b>flowering</b> events, and would release more seeds than the average plant in the population. It could, therefore, take over the population, establishing a <b>flowering</b> interval that is an integer multiple of the previous <b>flowering</b> interval. The hypothesis predicts that observed bamboo <b>flowering</b> intervals should factorize into small prime numbers.|$|R

Dried <b>flowers</b> are long lasting—up to some years—and are used in floral arrangements and the cut flower industry. More robust longer stemmed forms are used for commercial cut <b>flowers.</b> The main factor limiting lifespan of dried <b>flowers</b> is the wilting of stems, so <b>flowers</b> are sometimes wired into arrangements.

40|$|International audienceThe {{genetic control}} of the switch between {{seasonal}} and perpetual <b>flowering</b> has been deciphered in various perennial species. However, {{little is known about}} the genetic {{control of the}} dynamics of perpetual <b>flowering,</b> which changes abruptly at well-defined time instants during the growing season. Here, we characterize the perpetual <b>flowering</b> pattern and identify new genetic controls of this pattern in the cultivated strawberry. Twenty-one perpetual <b>flowering</b> strawberry genotypes were phenotyped at the macroscopic scale for their course of emergence of inflorescences and stolons during the growing season. A longitudinal analysis based on the segmentation of <b>flowering</b> rate profiles using multiple change-point models was conducted. The <b>flowering</b> pattern of perpetual <b>flowering</b> genotypes takes the form of three or four successive phases: an autumn-initiated <b>flowering</b> phase, a <b>flowering</b> pause, and a single stationary perpetual <b>flowering</b> phase or two perpetual <b>flowering</b> phases, the second one being more intense. The genetic control of <b>flowering</b> was analysed by quantitative trait locus mapping of <b>flowering</b> traits based on these <b>flowering</b> phases. We showed that the occurrence of a fourth phase of intense <b>flowering</b> is controlled by a newly identified locus, different from the locus FaPFRU, controlling the switch between seasonal and perpetual <b>flowering</b> behaviour. The role of this locus was validated by the analysis of data obtained previously during six consecutive years...|$|R

5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G.
