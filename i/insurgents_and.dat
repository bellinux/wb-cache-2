5|$|The 1991 Yugoslav {{campaign}} in Croatia {{was a series}} of engagements between the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force, and the Croatian National Guard (ZNG) then the Croatian Army (HV) during the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA was originally deployed in order to preserve Yugoslavia, and the initial plan of the campaign entailed the military occupation of Croatia and the removal of the Croatian leadership elected in 1990. The JNA intervention was the culmination of its involvement in the confiscation of weapons from Croatia's Territorial Defence, and in the Croatian Serb revolt that had begun in August 1990. From that time, the JNA had been frequently deployed to form a buffer zone between the <b>insurgents</b> <b>and</b> the ZNG or the Croatian police. In effect, these JNA buffer zones often secured the territorial gains of the <b>insurgents</b> <b>and</b> led to an increasingly hostile relationship between the JNA and Croatia. The JNA campaign plan was amended shortly before the campaign to include the relief of JNA barracks besieged by the ZNG. The besieging and subsequent capture of several JNA facilities allowed Croatia to arm its previously poorly equipped military and to equip new recruits.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1990 electoral {{defeat of}} the {{government}} of the Socialist Republic of Croatia, ethnic tensions grew.
