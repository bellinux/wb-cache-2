50|$|Since the 1960s, the {{standard}} test for rabies has been Direct <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> (dFA test). Because rabies {{is present in}} nervous tissue (and not blood like many other viruses), {{it is best to}} test for rabies in brain tissue. This test can only be done post-mortem.|$|E
50|$|A {{presumptive}} diagnosis {{can be made}} based on the history and clinical signs. Definitive diagnosis is achieved by direct or indirect <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>testing</b> (FAT), PCR, post mortem (signs include petechia and pulmonary congestion), histopathology or electron microscopy.|$|R
5000|$|A {{diagnosis}} {{cannot be}} made based on clinical signs, instead laboratory tests such as specialised bacterial culture, ELISA, PCR and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>testing</b> {{are necessary to}} identify the bacteria.

5000|$|A direct {{fluorescent}} antibody (DFA or dFA), {{also known as}} [...] "direct immunofluorescence", is an antibody that has been tagged in a direct <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test.</b> Its name derives {{from the fact that}} it directly tests the presence of an antigen with the tagged antibody, unlike western blotting, which uses an indirect method of detection, where the primary antibody binds the target antigen, with a secondary antibody directed against the primary, and a tag attached to the secondary antibody.|$|E
5000|$|Rabies can be {{difficult}} to diagnose, because, in the early stages, it is easily confused with other diseases or with aggressiveness. The reference method for diagnosing rabies is the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> (FAT), an immunohistochemistry procedure, which is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). [...] The FAT relies on the ability of a detector molecule (usually fluorescein isothiocyanate) coupled with a rabies-specific antibody, forming a conjugate, to bind to and allow the visualisation of rabies antigen using fluorescent microscopy techniques. Microscopic analysis of samples is the only direct method that allows for the identification of rabies virus-specific antigen in a short time and at a reduced cost, irrespective of geographical origin and status of the host. It has to be regarded as the first step in diagnostic procedures for all laboratories. Autolysed samples can, however, reduce the sensitivity and specificity of the FAT. The RT PCR assays proved to be a sensitive and specific tool for routine diagnostic purposes, particularly in decomposed samples or archival specimens. The diagnosis can be reliably made from brain samples taken after death. The diagnosis can also be made from saliva, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid samples, but this is not as sensitive and reliable as brain samples. Cerebral inclusion bodies called Negri bodies are 100% diagnostic for rabies infection but are found in only about 80% of cases. If possible, the animal from which the bite was received should also be examined for rabies.|$|E
40|$|The {{positivity}} of {{the direct}} immunoperoxidase and the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> for rabies virus antigen was comparatively evaluated in sixty young mice inoculated intracerebrally with street rabies virus. Thirty mice were sacrificed in assymptomatic state and the others in their agonizing state. The positive results obtained from impression brain smears of assymptomatic animals by direct immunoperoxidase and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> were 83. 3 % and 86. 6 %, respectively. The results found in impression brain smears of agonizing animals revelead 100 % positivity in both techniques.

40|$|In {{studies with}} chicks inoculated with the Sk- 1 strain of {{infectious}} bursal agent the bursa of Fabricius {{was found to}} be the tissue of choice for virus isolation as well as for use in the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> and the agar gel diffusion test. In separate experiments positive results were obtained until postinoculation days 3 or 4 by the agar gel diffusion test, 5 or 6 by the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> and 14 by the virus isolation method, respectively. Bursas from chickens involved in seven natural outbreaks of infectious bursal disease were then examined by these three methods. Virus was isolated from six outbreaks and infectious bursal agent antigen was demonstrated in three by the agar gel diffusion test method and seven (three by direct examination and four after one passage in chicks) by the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> method. Passage in chicks was required when nonspecific fluorescence complicated the interpretation of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> results...|$|E

40|$|The {{application}} of the soluble antigen fluorescent test {{as a tool for}} serological investigation of influenza type A infection in wild birds was studied. The soluble antigen <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> is basically an indirect <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> except that an artificial matrix of cellulose acetate discs is used as a substrate for antigen and the test results are scanned and recorded by a fluorometer. THe influenza type A soluble antigen fluorescent antibody was obtained from concentrated and detergent disrupted virus particles, absorbed onto cellulose acetate discs. Anti-influenza sera were prepared in pheasants and ducks to A/turkey/Ontario/ 6118 / 67 and in pigeons to A/turkey/Ontario/ 6213 / 68. The antigen-antibody complex was detected by specific staining with monovalent or polyvalent fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated rabbit anti-avian immunoglobulins. The soluble antigen <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> is a sensitive technique for the detection of specific influenza A antibodies in several avian species, and could be adapted for use in large scale surveys...|$|E

50|$|Clinical {{signs and}} history of {{previous}} outbreaks may be suggestive of IHN. Staphylococcal agglutination, virus neutralisation (VN), indirect <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>testing,</b> ELISA, PCR, and DNA probe technology techniques {{can be used to}} confirm diagnosis. The gold standard is virus neutralisation. Alternatively, the identification of degeneration and necrosis of granular cells in the lamina propria, stratum compactum, and stratum granulosum of the gastrointestinal tract on histopathology can be used to diagnose infection.|$|R
40|$|Performance indexes of the {{peroxidase}} {{antibody test}} {{were compared to}} that of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test.</b> The peroxidase antibody test had a statistically higher sensitivity and negative predictive value and a higher efficiency than the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> but its specificity and positive predictive value were within the 95 % confidence limits for the values found for the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test.</b> Such differences did not change when Chagas' disease and visceral leishmaniasis sera were included in index calculations. Statistical analysis showed that the two tests have a substantial degree of agreement but the immunofluorescent test had a specificity index and a positive predictive value equal to 100. 0 % when Chagas' disease and visceral leishmaniasis sera {{were not included in the}} calculations of the performance index; in this instance, a positive test result equals a disclosure of the disease attribute due to the inexistence of false positive results. The enzyme/ protein ratio of the peroxidase conjugate, resulting in heavy or light-labeled conjugates may pose technical problems to its use in serology tests...|$|E
40|$|The Phadebact(R) Gonococcus Test, a slide coagglutination test, was {{compared}} with the Difco <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> for the identification of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolated from 18 - to 24 -hour primary plates. A total of 316 morphologically characteristic, oxidase-positive, Gram-negative diplococci were tested. Altogether 298 isolates were identified definitively as N. gonorrhoeae by a rapid carbohydrate utilisation test; 287 of the 298 isolates of N. gonorrhoeae were identified by the coagglutination test, a sensitivity of 96 %. The sensitivity of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test</b> was 85 % (254 of 298 isolates). False-positive results due to cross-reactions with non-gonococcal Neisseria were uncommon (1 of 18 non-gonococcal isolates in the coagglutination test, a specificity of 94 %; 2 of 18 in the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>antibody</b> <b>test,</b> a specificity of 88 %). None of the 14 other contaminant organisms seen frequently on primary isolation media gave positive reactions. Interpretation of the coagglutination test proved to be difficult initially.
