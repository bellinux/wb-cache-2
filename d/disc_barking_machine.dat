The I and II Manual have been faithfully restored, originally located at the far end, III Manual (Swell) was then set down a level to the lower case. Also, the laterally placed pedal mechanism had to be recreated on two levels. The instrument again consisted of mechanical cone chests, equipped with the three manuals and modern <b>Barker</b> <b>machines.</b> 51 of the 66 registers are now wholly or partly of the original organ, 4 registers were reconstructed and 11 registers, mostly in the Swell, have been added.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} is to {{summarize}} usage of tractors in timber extraction and major problems of mechanized&# 13; timber harvesting in Turkey. Timber harvesting in Turkey is still carried out by manual methods due to&# 13; economical, social and environmental constraints. Almost 80 % of harvesting activities are mechanized in many&# 13; developed countries while this value is only 5 % in Turkey. Overall ratio of mechanization is relatively low. &# 13; Approximately percentage of man power, animal power, machine power and skyline harvesting are 72, 15, 8 and&# 13; 5 %, respectively. Turkish General Directorate of Forestry's mechanical park total amount is 457 in 2004. &# 13; Mechanical park amount has been reduced to 19 tractors (4 x 4 and assembled shovel), 169 skidding winches,&# 13; 6 tractors with equipment of snow cleaner, 46 forklifts, 26 loaders, 32 skylines, 65 agricultural tractors, 88 trucks,&# 13; 4 agricultural tractors with shovel, 2 <b>barking</b> <b>machines</b> as of 2004. Approximate percentages of skidders, trucks,&# 13; 4 x 2 tractors, forklifts, skylines, loaders, 4 x 4 tractors and <b>barking</b> <b>machines</b> are 36. 9, 19. 3, 16. 4, 10, 7, 5. 7, 4. 2 and&# 13; 0. 5 % in 2004. 4 x 2 and 4 x 4 tractors total amount has been reached to 41. 7 % in 1982, but this percentage has been&# 13; reduced to 20. 6 % in 2004. Total machine park amount has been reduced 41. 4 % between years 1998 - 2004 in&# 13; Turkey. In spite of existence of substantial number of harvesters, the amount of modern harvesting processor in&# 13; Turkey is not sufficient. Different type and marked machine hasn't taken into consideration to improve&# 13; mechanization and a poor standardization in harvesting is another problem in Turkey...|$|R

Previous studies have showed that humans have the ability to categorize various barks that they hear and to associate them with the appropriate emotional content [93]. They also showed that humans with different dog experience levels show similar trends in categorization of the possible inner state of the given barking dog. Another study showed that human perception of the motivational state of dogs is influenced by acoustic parameters in the barks [94]. In contrast, humans show only modest accuracy in discriminating between individual dogs by hearing their barks [95].|$|R

30|$|A T-shaped {{plastic insert}} {{was placed in}} a 90 -mm-diameter Petri dish to create a {{customised}} container that housed individually sexed wild-caught adult females and artificially reared larvae, pupae, and eggs of H. ligniperda during irradiation treatments. The adult females were placed in a ventilated 1 -mL plastic vial in one quarter of the dish, larvae were placed into holes made in artificial diet in one quarter, and pupae were placed in shallow impressions in artificial diet in the remaining half of the Petri dish. The eggs were placed on filter paper on the surface of diet on top of the pupae. Each Petri dish contained 20 adults, 20 eggs, 20 larvae, and 10 pupae. Following irradiation, as described below, individual adult female H. ligniperda were paired with an untreated “wild-caught” male on a <b>bark</b> <b>disc</b> in a 90 -mm ventilated Petri dish and checked for egg-laying between 25 and 37  days after treatment. Larval emergence from any eggs laid indicated female adults had not been sterilised. Treated H. ligniperda eggs were monitored every second day for 32  days, and successful hatch was deemed indicative of non-sterility. Treated H. ligniperda larvae and pupae were reared on artificial diet. Each emerging female adult was paired with a “wild-caught” male, and each emerging male adult was paired with a laboratory-reared virgin female on <b>bark</b> <b>discs</b> in 90 -mm ventilated Petri dishes to monitor egg production and subsequent hatch for up to 50  days. Again, successful egg hatch was considered indicative of non-sterility.|$|R
50|$|While {{returning}} his Snipe to {{an aircraft}} depot, he crossed enemy lines at 21,000 {{feet above the}} Forêt de Mormal. He attacked an enemy Rumpler two-seater which broke up, its crew escaping by parachute (the aircraft was of FAA 227, Observer Lt. Oskar Wattenburg killed). By his own admission, he was careless and was bounced by a formation of Fokker D.VIIs of Jagdgruppe 12, consisting of Jasta 24 and Jasta 44. In a descending battle against 15 or more enemy <b>machines,</b> <b>Barker</b> was wounded {{three times in the}} legs, then his left elbow was blown away, yet he managed to control his Snipe and shoot down or drive down three more enemy aircraft (two German pilot casualties were Vfw. Alfons Schymik of Jasta 24, killed, and Lt. Hinky of Jasta 44, wounded). The dogfight took place immediately above the lines of the Canadian Corps. Severely wounded and bleeding profusely, Barker force-landed inside Allied lines, his life being saved by the men of an RAF Kite Balloon Section who transported him to a field dressing station. The fuselage of his Snipe aircraft was recovered from the battlefield and is preserved at the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa, Ontario.|$|R
40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} (EPN) of {{the families}} steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae are a promising prospective control agent of the large pine weevil, Hylobius abietis L. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), a major pest in Irish forestry. Applications of EPN to tree stumps in Ireland and the UK {{have been shown to}} significantly reduce adult H. abietis populations emerging from the stumps. To date however, little work had been done on the host-finding abilities of applied EPN in the field and how those EPN will interact with adult H. abietis either already on site or those that emerge from the stumps. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the behavioural interactions between two EPN species and adult H. abietis and to assess one of the methods used to investigate the impact of applied EPN strains on the indigenous EPN population. To investigate if adult H. abietis react to the presence of EPN, one thousand nematodes were applied to the head region of adult weevils and grooming responses were recorded (Chapter 3). Insects that had Steinernema carpocapsae applied on average groomed for significantly longer (44. 16 seconds), than those that had Heterorhabditis downesi applied (11. 33 seconds). In order to gain an insight into the possible cause of these different insect reactions to these two EPN species observations of nematode behaviour on adult H. abietis were carried out (Chapter 3). Infective juveniles (IJs) of S. carpocapsae {{were more likely to be}} observed standing or moving across the body of the insect while H. downesi IJs were more likely to be observed not moving. It is thought that this difference in behaviour has caused the differences observed in H. abietis grooming reactions. Adult H. abietis were tested to see if the presence of EPN in the substrate would alter the amount of time the insects would take to leave the area (Chapter 3). There was no difference found in the time taken to leave S. carpocapsae or H. downesi treated substrates when compared to controls. The impact of EPN presence in the substrate on H. abietis feeding was also investigated (Chapter 3). Steinernema carpocapsae was found to reduce the level of feeding on <b>bark</b> <b>discs</b> after two days when compared to controls in a choice test. This difference was not found with H. downesi or after two days post-application with either nematode species. Adult H. abietis that had been exposed to EPN did not significantly change the amount of feeding on <b>bark</b> <b>discs</b> compared to non-exposed controls (Chapter 3). In all nematode treatments, infected weevils fed more than non-infected weevils in that treatment. Weevils that died during the assay fed more than those that did not die when exposed to a low dose of H. downesi but not in the other EPN treatments. As weevils that died that were not exposed to EPN also fed more it is thought that this is not due to nematode exposure. Weevils were able to mount an immune response to both S. carpocapsae and H. downesi as encapsulated IJs of each species were found upon dissection of the exposed insects. Foraging strategies of entomopathogenic nematodes have been the subject of several studies but most have been based on simple substrates such as agar and have not reflected the ability of certain EPN species to infect hosts in cryptic field habitats. The presence of twigs in the substrate increased H. abietis larval mortality by S. carpocapsae. Insects that were able to feed differed in their mortality from those that could not in a sand/peat mixed substrate but this difference was not found in a sand only substrate (Chapter 4). The presence of twigs or insect feeding did not alter the mortality of H. abietis larvae to H. downesi in a sand substrate. The various life stages of H. abietis were tested for susceptibility to EPN infection (Chapter 4). The adult proved to be relatively insusceptible to EPN infection at low doses, with a two day exposure of 200 IJs killing none of the adult weevils exposed. Continuous exposure on filter paper at doses up to 4000 IJs resulted in a higher mortality rate. In a peat medium with an eight hour exposure mortality was different for each EPN species tested with S. carpocapsae killing more adult insects than both S. feltiae and H. downesi at all doses. When larvae and pupae were tested for EPN susceptibility it was found that larvae were highly susceptible to even low concentrations for both continuous and limited exposure. Pupae were found to be less susceptible than callow adults as insects that fully pupated during assays became readily infected by EPN (Chapter 4). The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) method for assessing levels of hybridisation between EPN strains was assessed to examine the level of accuracy possible with this method (Chapter 5). A certain level of inheritance patterns of strains of known parentage was possible but this level proved too low for statistically valid examination. The AFLP method proved to be difficult to reproduce when assessing EPN gene flow...|$|R
