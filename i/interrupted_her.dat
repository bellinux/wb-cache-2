25|$|Nesbit managed only {{eleventh}} in the 3000m at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships in 1987, but {{was much}} higher placed the following year, taking the runner-up spot behind Lynn Jennings. At the separately held United States Olympic Trials {{she was back}} down the order, ending 17th in the 10,000 meters. This was last place by some distance, but she persevered until the finish, driven on by memories of her late father. She failed {{to break into the}} top of the American elite that decade, finishing 13th at the 1988 USA Cross Country and tenth at the 1989 USA Outdoor 3000m. A plantar fasciitis injury <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> career in 1989 to 1991, but she reflected that she had been doing too much training and welcomed the change.|$|E
25|$|On 26 March, urgent orders <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> {{employment}} schedule {{once again}} and sent her to a holding area just east of Crete {{in response to an}} intensification of the situation in Lebanon. For the first few weeks she steamed squares in the ocean while rehearsing contingency plans for a possible evacuation of Americans from Beirut. Despite the passage of time, the Lebanese political scene remained volatile; so the squadron moved to a deep water anchorage outside Crete's territorial waters. April and May came and went without any real change, except that, late in May, the squadron got underway and steamed closer to Lebanon. Finally, after 69 days at sea, a lull in the fighting coupled with negotiations in progress allowed Barnstable County to proceed to Naples for a scheduled port call. The visit lasted from 1 to 4 June, and, then the squadron left for an amphibious exercise conducted at Carboneras, Spain. At its end, the squadron returned to the eastern Mediterranean and resumed station off Lebanon.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Franco-Prussian War abruptly <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> theatrical career. The news of {{the defeat of the}} French Army, the surrender of Napoleon III at Sedan, and the proclamation of the Third French Republic on 4 September 1870 was followed by a siege of the city by the Prussian Army. Paris was cut off from news and from its food supply, and the theaters were closed. Bernhardt took charge of converting the Odéon into a hospital for soldiers wounded in the battles outside the city. She organized the placement of 32 beds in the lobby and the foyers, brought in her personal chef to prepare soup for the patients, and persuaded her wealthy friends and admirers to donate supplies for the hospital. Besides organizing the hospital, she worked as a nurse, assisting the chief surgeon with amputations and operations. When the coal supply of the city ran out, Bernhardt used old scenery, benches, and stage props for fuel to heat the theater. In early January 1871, after 16 weeks of the siege, the Germans began to bombard the city with long-range cannons. The patients had to be moved to the cellar, and before long, the hospital was forced to close. Bernhardt arranged for serious cases to be transferred to another military hospital, and she rented an apartment on rue de Provence to house the remaining 20 patients. By the end of the siege, Bernhardt's hospital had cared for more than 150 wounded soldiers, including a young undergraduate from the École Polytechnique, Ferdinand Foch, who later commanded the Allied armies in the First World War.|$|E

500|$|British author Georgette Heyer {{essentially}} {{invented the}} Regency romance in 1935 {{with the publication}} of Regency Buck, and her early Regencies were quite successful. In 1950 she began to work on what she called [...] "the magnum opus of my latter years", a medieval trilogy intended to cover the House of Lancaster between 1393 and 1435. To earn income, she periodically <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> research to write additional Regency romances; Lady of Quality, published in 1972, was the last of them, and the last of her novels to be published during her lifetime. Heyer suffered a stroke in July 1973 and was in ill health until her death the following year.|$|E

In 2009 Minaj {{was involved in a}} conflict with ego trip's Miss Rap Supreme winner Rece Steele, who was annoyed when Minaj <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> interview and put a sign behind Steele's head; Minaj hung up on interviewers from Spate magazine when they asked about the incident. She {{released her}} third mixtape, Beam Me Up Scotty, on April 18, 2009 and it received favorable coverage on BET and MTV. One of its tracks, [...] "I Get Crazy", reached number 20 on the U.S. Billboard Hot Rap Songs chart and number 37 on the magazine's Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} months after her {{graduation}} she studied at Hampton Institute and during the next school year she taught dramatic art and physical culture at Lincoln Institute, an African American college in Jefferson City, Missouri. Not liking the situation there she returned to Chicago to enter a two-year program at Chicago Normal School {{so that she could}} qualify to teach elementary school in that city. In the fall of 1917 Major served as a teacher-in-training, or [...] "cadet," [...] in the Chicago public school system. In December of that year she <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> progress toward becoming a Chicago school teacher in order to marry H. Binga Dismond, whom she had met at the University of Chicago. The ceremony took place at Camp Logan in Houston, Texas, where Dismond was training for service in the Army. During American participation in World War I, while he served in France, she became a Red Cross nurse in Chicago, leaving that organization in 1918 with the rank of major.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1911, the Ottoman Empire—Greece's {{traditional}} naval rival—set about modernizing its fleet. That year, the Ottomans {{ordered the}} dreadnought [...] The expansion of Ottoman naval power threatened Greek {{control of the}} Aegean; to counter the Ottoman dreadnought, Greece decided to order a dreadnought of its own, Salamis, from a German shipyard. The keel was laid down on 23 July 1913; the hull was complete and ready for launching by 11 November 1914. However, the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> completion; work stopped on 31 December 1914. The guns that had been ordered for the ship in the United States were instead sold by the manufacturer, Bethlehem Steel, to the Royal Navy to arm the British s. After {{the end of the}} war, the Greek Navy refused to accept the incomplete hull. She was eventually scrapped in 1932 following a lengthy arbitration between the Greek Navy and the German shipyard.|$|E

500|$|The Rices {{moved back}} to San Francisco in 1962, {{experiencing}} {{the birth of the}} Hippie movement firsthand as they lived in the soon-to-be fabled Haight-Ashbury district, Berkeley, and later the Castro District. [...] "I'm a totally conservative person," [...] she later told The New York Times, [...] "In the middle of Haight-Ashbury in the 1960s, I was typing away while everybody was dropping acid and smoking grass. I was known as my own square." [...] Rice attended San Francisco State University and obtained a B.A. in Political Science in 1964. Their daughter Michele, later nicknamed [...] "Mouse", was born to the couple on September 21, 1966, and Rice later <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> graduate studies at SFSU to become a Ph.D. candidate at the University of California, Berkeley. However, she soon became disenchanted with the emphasis on literary criticism and the language requirements. In Rice's words, [...] "I wanted to be a writer, not a literature student." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{prominent}} {{match on}} the card was an [...] "I Quit" [...] match between Vince McMahon and his daughter, Stephanie McMahon. At the No Mercy event, however, Vince announced that Stephanie could score a pinfall or submission to win the match. The match build up began on the September 25 episode of SmackDown, when Stephanie <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> father's ceremony honoring the new WWE Champion Brock Lesnar to announce that the Undertaker would face Lesnar at No Mercy for the championship. Vince, angered by this, demanded that she retract the decision. When Stephanie did not, Vince announced {{that the two of}} them would face each other in an [...] "I Quit" [...] match at No Mercy. The next week on SmackDown, Vince offered Stephanie another chance to rescind the title match, which she refused and as a result Vince added the stipulation that if she lost, she would be forced to resign as the General Manager of SmackDown!. The following week, Linda McMahon, Vince's wife and Stephanie's mother, made Vince agree that if he lost the match, he would resign as WWE Chairman.|$|E
500|$|Swift's first {{televised}} {{performance of}} [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] {{was at a}} free outdoor concert on May 29, 2009, broadcast by The Today Show.

Swift performed [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, the same day in which Kanye West <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> acceptance speech. She began the performance in a subway station, dressed in a brown trench coat and black beanie, and continued it in a subway, taking off the trench coat and revealing a red cocktail dress. Once the subway docked at a stop, Swift completed the performance atop a yellow taxi cab. Swift later performed the song on The View and Saturday Night Live. In the fall of 2009 and winter of 2009 through 2010, Swift commenced promotion for [...] "You Belong with Me" [...] countries outside of the United States; she performed the song on the United Kingdom channel GMTV, the Australian charity concert Sydney Sound Relief, and the Japanese talk show The Sukkiri Morning Show.|$|E

500|$|Bryant {{became the}} butt of jokes on {{television}} shows and film, even by former colleague Bob Hope. Everywhere she went {{in the days after}} the vote she was met with noisy protests: Norfolk, Virginia—where demonstrators <b>interrupted</b> <b>her</b> presentation so forcefully she began crying—Chicago, and dozens of other cities. The Ku Klux Klan appeared at one of Bryant's appearances in Huntington, West Virginia claiming they were there to protect her. She attracted the largest gay demonstration in Canadian history when she appeared at a Toronto religious performance. Though she performed and spoke only at revivals and other religious shows, audiences were often less than half the expected number, and many would leave when she came on stage. In Houston Bryant was invited to perform for the Texas State Bar Association two weeks after the Dade County vote. With no cohesive political community, a few gay organizers invited people to protest her appearance at the Hyatt Regency. An organizer estimated for police that 500people might participate, but guessed because no gay community had responded to a cause before; police prepared for that number. However, thousands of people swarmed around the hotel chanting loudly enough to drown Bryant's performance; a conservative estimate of the participants' numbers was 2,000. The audience inside could not hear Bryant, and at one point attorneys working with the American Civil Liberties Union walked out and joined the protesters. One of the organizers said that he had never seen so many gay people in one place before, and then made a speech thanking Bryant: [...] "If God in his infinite wisdom had not created Anita Bryant, we would have had to invent her". He claimed the protest had the same result in Houston as the Stonewall riots.|$|E
