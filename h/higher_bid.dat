5|$|In October 2016, Madonna {{announced}} plans of collaborating with Art Basel {{to revive the}} Tears of a Clown show, at a benefit gala on December 2, 2016 at Miami Beach's Faena Forum. The location was developed by Argentine hotelier and real estate developer, Alan Faena, and the show would coincide {{with the opening of}} the Forum. The concert was held along with an accompanying art auction and dinner, to benefit Madonna's Raising Malawi foundation to support their projects like Mercy James Pediatric Surgery Hospital in Malawi, as well as art and education initiatives for impoverished children in the country. Madonna herself auctioned some of her art collection, as well as never-before-seen pictures from her marriage to actor Sean Penn, photographed by Herb Ritts. Tickets were highly priced, at general admission of $5,000 with VIP meet-and-greet packages coming at $150,000. She also auctioned the flapper dress from Rebel Heart Tour, modelled by singer Ariana Grande during the show. Penn was present in the audience and bid on several items, and at one point handcuffed Madonna and crawled through her legs for generating a <b>higher</b> <b>bid.</b>|$|E

These included Holmes à Court adding more assets and agreeing to establish a scholarship at a United States university in Jackson's name. Although Koppelman/Bandier offered a <b>higher</b> <b>bid,</b> Jackson's bid of £24,400,000, was accepted because he could close the deal quickly, having completed due diligence of ATV Music prior to any formal agreement. The deal was signed on 10August1985. After the acquisition, Jackson and McCartney appeared together in a photograph, reportedly to dispel rumours about their falling-out over Jackson's ownership of the Beatles' songs.|$|E

25|$|Quite {{a bit of}} {{controversy}} arose during the 2005 Scott Tournament of Hearts, {{as it was the}} first major tournament where the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation had full rights to televise the games. Previously, The Sports Network showed all the draws except the semi-final and the final, which was covered by the CBC. However, in a decision made in 2004, the Canadian Curling Association awarded the new contract to CBC, which had a <b>higher</b> <b>bid</b> than TSN. This would mean only the afternoon draws would be covered on the main network while evening draws were shown on the Digital Cable Channel, CBC Country Canada which only reached half a million Canadian homes. Morning draws, which TSN did not want to renew anyway were not shown at all. Many Canadian fans were outraged come Tournament time, as they were disappointed with what many considered inferior coverage on the CBC as well as the scheduling problems. Some games were moved to The Score and some games on CBC Country Canada were cut short because of Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) regulations that restricted the channel to only 12.4 hours of sports per week. This angered fans, and the CCA as well as many event sponsors were sent many angry letters and phone calls, some people even threatening to boycott the sponsors.|$|E

Also, Kilroy was named the Public Official of the Year by the Central Ohio Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers {{as a result of}} her role in creating the Columbus/Franklin County Affordable Housing Trust. Her term as commissioner was not without controversy, however. Kilroy came under fire during the awarding of contracts for the construction of Huntington Park because the lowest bid for the concrete was rejected in favor of a <b>higher</b> <b>bid</b> by a union shop. Eventually, the issue went to court and the commissioners decided to award the contract to the low bidder. She lost the 2006 race for U.S. Representative from [...] to Deborah Pryce, 50.2%–49.7%.|$|E

Until shareholder approval was received, Los Angeles billionaires Ron Burkle and Eli Broad had the right to submit a <b>higher</b> <b>bid,</b> in which case Zell would have received a $25million buyout fee.|$|E

50|$|Man-O-War Pitch {{is another}} variant of classic Pitch. It {{is similar to}} Abacos Pitch except after the bidding round, the player who made the <b>highest</b> <b>bid</b> looks at the cards given up by players who looked at their hand prior to bidding, one at a time. The player with the <b>highest</b> <b>bid</b> may choose to take or not take each card he looks at. If he chooses to take a card, he {{discards}} a card of his choice. This variant provides a significant advantage to the player with the <b>highest</b> <b>bid</b> and therefore promotes aggressive bidding.|$|R

In 2012, a <b>higher</b> <b>bid,</b> of $3.46 million, also going to the Glide Foundation, won a lunch with Buffet. Even in 2016 an anonymous bidder won $3.45 million lunch with Warren Buffett and the money raised from the auction was given to Glide Foundation.|$|E

Stewart and Creme were about to go on holiday, however, and had left their manager Harvey Lisberg with power of attorney to accept the Branson offer. No sooner had they left the country, but another <b>higher</b> <b>bid</b> arrived from Phonogram and was accepted by the management team, including Lisberg.

2500|$|On Sunday 30 October 2005 The Sunday Times {{reported}} that P was in takeover talks with Thunder FZE, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai Ports World, a company {{owned by the}} government of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

In early December P regained its status as a FTSE 100 company when BPB plc was taken over.

This is the first analysis of such a selling mechanism, which provides insights into how the two kinds of behavior might be related in real life. The winner of the object is the bidder with the <b>highest</b> <b>bid</b> not submitted by any other bidder. In the equilibrium of our game theoretical model, each bid yields the same probability of winning. Bidders {{are more likely to}} submit <b>higher</b> <b>bids,</b> and the bid distribution does not depend on the value of the object or the <b>highest</b> <b>bid</b> allowed if one controls for the number of bidders. These key theoretical predictions are confirmed by the data...|$|R
