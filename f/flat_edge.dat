5|$|Wise asked Harold Michelson {{to be the}} film's {{production}} designer, and Michelson was put to work on {{finishing the}} incomplete Phase II sets. The designer began with the bridge, which had nearly been completed. Michelson first removed Chekov's new weapons station, a semicircular plastic bubble grafted onto {{one side of the}} bridge wall. The idea for Phase II was that Chekov would have looked out toward space while crosshairs in the bubble tracked targets. Wise instead wanted Chekov's station to face the Enterprises main viewer, a difficult request as the set was primarily circular. Production illustrator Michael Minor created a new look for the station using a <b>flat</b> <b>edge</b> {{in the corner of the}} set.|$|E
25|$|On all coins, the beading (ring {{of small}} dots) {{around the edge}} of the obverses has been removed. The obverse of the 20p coin has also been amended to {{incorporate}} the year, which had been on the reverse of the coin since its introduction in 1982 (giving rise to an unusual issue of a mule version without any date at all). The orientation of both sides of the 50p coin has been rotated through 180 degrees, meaning the bottom of the coin is now a corner rather than a <b>flat</b> <b>edge.</b> The numerals showing the decimal value of each coin, previously present on all coins except £2 and £1, have been removed, leaving the values spelled out in words only.|$|E
25|$|Some {{elements}} {{were still in}} flux, however. Ground plantings had not been selected yet, {{and the depth of}} the reflecting pool and the direction of its water flow were undecided. Also not yet finalized were how to handle the water features in winter. The National Park Service wished to drain both water elements, but memorial planners were hoping to maintain a low level of water in the star-shaped basin year-round. The height and style of the reflecting pool's edge was also unclear, as it depended on the direction of the water flow and other details. Among the designs being considered were a low, <b>flat</b> <b>edge</b> which could serve as seating; a low, angled edge which discouraged seating; and no edge, in which case the reflecting pool would be nearly level with the plaza. The design of benches, and their placement, was also still under discussion.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{technique}} for eliminating <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> from a Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) in a morphologically consistent way. The algorithm {{is meant to be}} a preprocessing step for performing morphological computations on a terrain. Terrain morphology is rooted in Morse theory for smooth functions. Segmentation algorithms have been defined for TINs, mostly based on discrete versions of Morse theory, and under the assumption that the terrain model does not include <b>flat</b> <b>edges.</b> On the other hand, <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> often occur in real data, and thus either they are eliminated through data perturbation, or the segmentation algorithms must {{be able to deal with}} them. In both cases, the resulting Morse segmentations are highly affected by the presence of <b>flat</b> <b>edges.</b> The new technique we propose provides a better solution, as it preserves the set of maxima and minima of the original terrain, and improves consistency among the terrain decompositions produced by different segmentation algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The heart {{tissue is}} an excitable media. A Cellular Automata {{is a type}} of model {{that can be used to}} model cardiac action {{potential}} propagation. One of the advantages of this approach against the methods based on differential equations is its high speed in large scale simulations. Recent cellular automata models are not able to avoid <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> in the result patterns or have large neighborhoods. In this paper, we present a new model to eliminate <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> by minimum number of neighbors...|$|R
5000|$|Among Muscogee Creeks and Four Mothers Society members, the Stomp Dance Grounds {{contain an}} {{elevated}} square platform with the <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> {{of the square}} facing the cardinal directions. Arbors are constructed upon the <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> of the square in which the men sit facing {{one of the four}} directions. This is formally referred to as the Square Ground, which is encircled by a ring-mound of earth. In the center of this is the ceremonial fire, which is referred to by many names including [...] "Mother" [...] fire. Ceremonially, this fire is the focus of the songs and prayers of the people and {{is considered to be a}} living sacred being.|$|R
2500|$|He {{was known}} for his {{discipline}} and blistering tongue-lashings directed at friend and foe who performed unsuitably in his eyes. In the later part of 1862, he saber-slapped (hit with the <b>flat</b> <b>edge</b> of his saber) an inattentive camp guard and loudly declared the soldier an [...] "SOB." [...] Because of his [...] "abuse of the guard," [...] he resigned his rank of colonel, his command and subjected himself to a rigorous religious revival then an active recruiting effort.|$|E
2500|$|A niddy-noddy (plural niddy-noddies) {{is a tool}} used to make skeins from yarn. It {{consists}} of a central bar, with crossbars at each end, offset from each other by 90°. The central bar is generally carved {{to make it easier}} to hold. Either one of the crossbars will have a <b>flat</b> <b>edge</b> to allow the skein to slide off, or will be completely removable. [...] Niddy-noddies can be constructed of many different materials including wood, metal, and plastic. Wood is traditional, and most quality niddy-noddies are still made of wood. Budget spinners occasionally use niddy-noddies made from PVC pipes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wicket door}} has {{pilaster}}s {{on either side}} unseen in other Virginia colonial churches. Each pilaster consists of the following structure from the bottom at the water table to the top: water table – five bricks (identical in height to rest of the water table); border of beveled brick; pillar – 11 convex bricks one brick wide; a torus- shaped border brick; a pillar of 8 horizontally convex bricks; a border brick of an ovolo with a <b>flat</b> <b>edge</b> on top; the apex of two bricks {{in the form of}} a flattened arrow; and a tip of [...] a half-sphere one-half brick wide [...]|$|E
50|$|A coffin lock or screws {{may be used}} to join {{securely}} adjacent flats, or traditionally with a lash line cleat, where cotton sash cord is lashed around cleats {{installed on}} the <b>flat's</b> <b>edges.</b> This allows for quick standing and striking of the set.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to an overall spoon shape with four fork tines, it has two hard, <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> on either side, suitable for cutting through soft food. They often have a geometric rather than rounded bowl, with two longitudinal folds in the metal.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} similar to hairpin banksia (B. spinulosa) but differs in having leaves with <b>flat</b> <b>edges.</b> It also resembles Banksia cunninghamii (also known as B. spinulosa var. cunninghamii) but has a shorter, wider {{infructescence}} and a lignotuber, absent from B. cunninghamii.|$|R
2500|$|The blade has {{a groove}} {{on the bottom}} {{creating}} two distinct edges — inside and outside. Judges prefer that skaters glide on one edge of the blade and not on {{both at the same}} time, which is referred to as a <b>flat</b> <b>edge.</b> During a spin, skaters use the [...] "sweet spot" [...] of the blade, formally called a rocker, which is the roundest portion of the blade, just behind the pick and near the middle of the blade. Skates used in single and pair skating have a set of large, jagged teeth called toe picks {{on the front of the}} blade. Toe picks are mainly used for the take-off on jumps. Ice dancing blades are an inch shorter in the rear and have smaller toe picks.|$|E

6000|$|Before a {{word had}} passed between them, the lawyer's mind was relieved. Mrs. Gallilee shone {{on him with}} her sweetest smiles; pressed his hand with her friendliest warmth; admired the nosegay with her readiest enthusiasm. [...] "Quite perfect," [...] she said--"especially the Pansy. The round <b>flat</b> <b>edge,</b> Mr. Mool; the upper petals {{perfectly}} uniform--there is a flower that defies criticism! I long to dissect it." ...|$|E
40|$|Multi-pass slab vertical-horizontal (V-H) {{rolling process}} with {{variable}} edging roll shape have been simulated with explicit dynamic {{finite element method}} and updating geometric method. The distributions of plastic strain contour in slab during rolling process with different edging roll and under different rolling stage have been obtained. The results show that there exist two thin strain assembling zones in slab when the <b>flat</b> <b>edging</b> roll is used, and there just exist one strain assembling zone in slab when the edging roll with groove is used. And compared the deformation equality between <b>flat</b> <b>edging</b> roll and edging roll with groove, the later {{is better than the}} former, which supplies the theory prove to the slab deformation distribution during V-H rolling process and is helpful for predicting the slab texture...|$|R
40|$|The {{edges of}} 2 D {{materials}} show novel electronic, magnetic, and optical properties, especially when reduced to nanoribbon widths. Therefore, methods to create atomically <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> in 2 D materials {{are essential for}} future exploitation. Atomically <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> in 2 D materials are found after brittle fracture or when electrically biasing, but a simple scalable approach for creating atomically <b>flat</b> periodic <b>edges</b> in monolayer 2 D transition metal dichalcogenides {{has yet to be}} realized. Here, we show how heating monolayer MoS 2 to 800 °C in vacuum produces atomically flat Mo terminated zigzag edges in nanoribbons. We study this at the atomic level using an ultrastable in situ heating holder in an aberration-corrected transmission electron microscope and discriminating Mo from S at the edge, revealing unique Mo terminations for all zigzag orientations that remain stable and atomically flat when cooling back to room temperature. Highly faceted MoS 2 nanoribbon constrictions are produced with Mo rich edge structures that have theoretically predicted spin separated transport channels, which are promising for spin logic applications...|$|R
50|$|Sharpening stones {{come in a}} {{wide range}} of shapes, sizes, and {{material}} compositions. Stones may be flat, for working <b>flat</b> <b>edges,</b> or shaped for more complex edges, such as those associated with some wood carving or woodturning tools. They may be composed of natural quarried material, or from man-made material.|$|R
60|$|Followed by the Asika and Jeekie, Alan {{walked up}} and looked {{her in the face}} and to his excited {{imagination}} she appeared to grin at him in answer. Then while the priests prostrated themselves, he examined the golden basin or laver, and saw that at the further side of it was a little platform approached by steps. On the top of these golden steps were two depressions such as might have been worn out in the course of ages by persons kneeling there. Also the <b>flat</b> <b>edge</b> of the basin which stood about thirty inches above the level of the topmost step, was scored as though by hundreds of sword cuts which had made deep lines in the pure metal. The basin itself was empty.|$|E

50|$|The {{periphery}} (<b>flat</b> <b>edge)</b> of {{the wheel}} is {{in contact with the}} workpiece, producing the flat surface. Peripheral grinding is used in high-precision work on simple flat surfaces; tapers or angled surfaces; slots; flat surfaces next to shoulders; recessed surfaces; and profiles.|$|E
5000|$|The jointer derives {{its name}} from its primary {{function}} of producing <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> on boards prior to joining them edge-to-edge to produce wider boards. The use of this term probably arises from {{the name of a}} type of hand plane, the jointer plane, which is also used primarily for this purpose.|$|R

50|$|Spatulas {{are usually}} used to scrape within the {{contours}} of a mixing bowl or to level {{off the top of}} a dry mixing cup. It is a tool with two <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> on a flexible blade. A spatula is usually short and about 8 inches long. A spatula also refers to a turner which is used to flip over pancakes and meat patties.|$|R
5000|$|... {{musical saw}} is a {{flexible}} handsaw played by {{holding the handle}} between the knees and bending the blade while bowing along the <b>flat</b> <b>edge.</b> The musical saw {{is found in the}} folk music of Russia and rural America, and is a popular vaudeville instrument.|$|E
50|$|The pier table {{may often}} be semicircular, the <b>flat</b> <b>edge</b> against the wall. Pier tables from later periods are often large and quite ornate. Well-known {{designers}} such as Duncan Phyfe, Robert Adam, George Hepplewhite, and Thomas Sheraton all designed and manufactured notable examples of pier tables.|$|E

5000|$|Sanuki udon (...) {{is a type}} of udon noodle {{most popular}} in the Shikoku region, but is now easily found {{throughout}} the neighboring Kansai region and much of Japan. It is characterized by its square shape and <b>flat</b> <b>edges.</b> Many udon shops now specialize solely in sanuki udon, and are usually identified by the text [...] "sanuki" [...] in hiragana (...) appearing {{in the name of the}} shop or on the sign.|$|R
5000|$|The 100 mon {{was first}} {{manufactured}} {{by the government}} of Satsuma in Kagoshima City from 1862 for circulation within the Ryukyu Islands {{as well as in the}} Satsuma Domain itself, but started to circulate in Japan's other provinces soon after their production. Coins minted in Kagoshima bear the mark of the katakana character [...] "sa" [...] (...) on the left and right <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> of the observe, which signifies that the coin is from Satsuma Domain.|$|R
50|$|Rake is {{measured}} by placing a protractor flat on the planar surface, with the <b>flat</b> <b>edge</b> horizontal and measuring {{the angle of the}} lineation clockwise from horizontal. The orientation of the lineation can then be calculated from the rake and strike-dip information of the plane it was measured from, using a stereographic projection.|$|E
50|$|The broad nib, {{also called}} broad-edge or chisel-edge, is the older {{of the two}} nib types. It is rigid and has a <b>flat</b> <b>edge.</b> The pen is usually held at a {{constant}} angle to the horizontal; different scripts require different nib angles. Thick and thin strokes are created by varying {{the direction of the}} stroke.|$|E
50|$|The java loach, {{like its}} fellow Pangio species, {{has a long}} eel-like body with small eyes set high in the skull. Its rayed dorsal fin is set far back on the dorsal side, halfway between the tail and middle of the fish. The tail ends with a <b>flat</b> <b>edge</b> and may be {{slightly}} forked in the middle.|$|E
50|$|While a G-clamp is {{a useful}} tool for woodworking, special care should be taken when working with any woods. The <b>flat</b> {{gripping}} <b>edges</b> of the frame, generally no larger than half an inch or a centimetre (depending {{on the size of the}} clamp) can cause indentations and marring of the surfaces being clamped. This can be avoided by buffering between the clamp and the timber using two pieces of scrap wood. As each piece of scrap wood is directly in contact with the <b>flat</b> <b>edges</b> of the frame and with the items being clamped, this allows the scrap wood to receive the damage from the clamping, while dispersing the clamping force across the piece of scrap wood into the clamped objects. Deep-throated clamps are also available and provide greater reach for smaller jobs.|$|R
50|$|Isopora palifera {{is found}} in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Its range extends from South Africa and Madagascar to East Africa, Aldabra and Chagos, India, China, Japan, Indonesia and Australia. It is the commonest species of coral in the {{northern}} part of the Great Barrier Reef. It is a reef building coral and is found subtidally on reef <b>flats,</b> <b>edges</b> walls and slopes. Isopora palifera first appears in the fossil record in Papua New Guinea in the Pliocene.|$|R
25|$|A {{rail spike}} is roughly chisel-shaped {{and with a}} <b>flat</b> <b>edged</b> point; the spike is driven with the edge {{perpendicular}} to the grain, which gives greater resistance to loosening. The main function {{is to keep the}} rail in gauge. When attaching tie plates the attachment is made as strong as possible, whereas when attaching a rail to tie or tie plate the spike is not normally required to provide a strong vertical force, allowing the rail some freedom of movement.|$|R
