40|$|The <b>Jun</b> <b>protein</b> is a {{transcription}} factor of the AP- 1 complex, {{and it is}} concentrated in the cell nucleus. While the cellular <b>Jun</b> <b>protein</b> is transported into the nucleus in a cell-cycle-independent fashion, the oncogenic viral version of the protein translocates into the nucleus most rapidly during the G 2 phase of the cell cycle and only slowly during G 1 and S phases. This cell cycle dependence of nuclear transport has been mapped to the cysteine to serine mutation in the carboxyl-terminal portion of viral Jun. We have identified a complex nuclear translocation signal located in the basic region of viral Jun. This signal has the sequence ASKSRKRKL. A peptide of this sequence synthesized in vitro and conjugated to IgG can mediate cell-cycle-dependent translocation of the microinjected conjugate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. The nuclear translocation signal has two functional domains. The pentapeptide RKRKL is sufficient as a cell-cycle-independent nuclear address. The entire signal is needed for cell-cycle-dependent nuclear translocation. The amino-terminal tetrapeptide contains the cysteine to serine substitution responsible for cell cycle dependence. Deletion analysis of the <b>Jun</b> <b>protein</b> suggests that the nuclear translocation signal identified in the basic region is required for nuclear translocation of Jun and {{may be the only}} such signal in the Jun molecule...|$|E

40|$|We have {{characterized}} {{the expression of}} c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, and FosB proteins following serum stimulation of quiescent Swiss 3 T 3 cells by immunoprecipitation analyses. The synthesis of the three <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> rapidly increases following stimulation, remaining at a significant level for at least 8 h. JunB protein presents the highest expression of all. FosB, like c-Fos, is transiently induced. Pulse-chase experiments show {{that all of the}} proteins except JunD are short-lived. We have shown that c-Fos and FosB form complexes in vivo with the different <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> and that JunB complexes are predominant. In vitro association and competition experiments show that the affinities between the different Fos and <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> are similar. This finding, together with the in vivo observations described above, suggests that the proportion of the different Jun/Fos heterodimers is governed by the concentration of the different components. The Fos and <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> are phosphoproteins, and some remain relatively highly phosphorylated in their heterodimeric form...|$|R

40|$|Inducible {{epidermal}} deletion of JunB and c-Jun {{in adult}} mice causes a psoriasis-like inflammatory skin disease. Increased {{levels of the}} proinflammatory cytokine TNFα {{play a major role}} in this phenotype. Here we define the underlying molecular mechanism using genetic mouse models. We show that <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> control TNFα shedding in the epidermis by direct transcriptional activation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 3 (TIMP- 3), an inhibitor of the TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE). TIMP- 3 is down-regulated and TACE activity is specifically increased, leading to massive, cell-autonomous TNFα shedding upon loss of both JunB and c-Jun. Consequently, a prominent TNFα-dependent cytokine cascade is initiated in the epidermis, inducing severe skin inflammation and perinatal death of newborns from exhaustion of energy reservoirs such as glycogen and lipids. Importantly, this metabolic “cachectic” phenotype can be genetically rescued in a TNFR 1 -deficient background or by epidermis-specific re-expression of TIMP- 3. These findings reveal that <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> are essential physiological regulators of TNFα shedding by controlling the TIMP- 3 /TACE pathway. This novel mechanism describing how <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> control skin inflammation offers potential targets for the treatment of skin pathologies associated with increased TNFα levels...|$|R

These results suggest that oncogenic transformation by Jun is not caused merely by an up-regulation of AP- 1 adivity.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the different Fos/Jun complexes present in Swiss 3 T 3 cells either following serum stimulation of quiescent cells or during exponential growth by immunoprecipitation analyses. We {{have shown that}} while c-Fos is the major Fos protein associated with the <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) soon after serum stimulation, at later times Fra- 1 and Fra- 2 are the predominant Fos proteins associated with the different <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins.</b> During exponential growth, the synthesis of Fra- 1 and Fra- 2 is maintained at a significant level, in contrast to c-Fos and FosB, which are expressed at very low or undetectable levels. Consequently, Fra- 1 and Fra- 2 are the main Fos proteins complexed with the <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> in asynchronously growing cells. To determine whether the Fos proteins are differentially required during the G 0 -to-G 1 transition and exponential growth for the entrance into S phase, we microinjected affinity-purified antibodies directed against c-Fos, FosB, Fra- 1, and Fra- 2. We have found that while the activities of c-Fos and FosB are required mostly during the G 0 -to-G 1 transition, Fra- 1 and Fra- 2 are involved both in the G 0 -to-G 1 transition and in asynchronous growth...|$|R
40|$|We present {{evidence}} that oestrogen receptor activity in human MCF- 7 breast cancer cells {{is reduced by}} over-expression of c-Jun or c-Fos proteins {{and to a lesser}} extent by Jun B overexpression. In contrast, overexpression of <b>Jun</b> D <b>protein</b> does not affect the activity of the oestrogen receptor. A region of c-Jun found to be required for repression of oestrogen receptor activity is located outside the DNA binding domain and is not conserved among the three <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins.</b> Finally, we suggest that c-Jun and c-Fos act independently to inactivate the oestrogen receptor...|$|R

40|$|The Jun gene maps on {{chromosome}} 1 p 32 -p 31 spanning 333799 bp. The {{study by}} Hattori et al {{suggested that the}} Jun gene has no introns. Transcription Due to 5 ' and 3 ' heterogeneities, several transcripts of Jun mRNA has been identified. The predicted molecular weight of <b>JUN</b> <b>protein</b> is 41. 9 kD. Protein Description The <b>JUN</b> <b>protein</b> was originally identified as an oncoprotein encoded by a cellular insert in the genome of avian sarcoma virus 17. Following studies demonstrated that JUN is {{a critical component of}} AP- 1 transcription factor that recognizes the palindromic DNA sequence TGAC/GTCA, the so-called TPA response element (TRE), in the promoter or intron region of a number of genes. JUN can stably associate with itself or Fos protein to form AP- 1 complex. JUN can also interact with some activating transcription factor (ATF) members, such as ATF 2, ATF 3 and ATF 4, to form heterodimers that bind to the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) DNA sequence, TGACGTCA. All JUN proteins from different species contain a N-terminal JNK docking domain (delta domain) adjacent to the JNK phosphorylating site Ser 63 / 73. In the C-terminal, there is a basic domain for DNA binding, followed by a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a leucine zipper motif for dimerization with partner proteins...|$|E
40|$|The {{product of}} the {{recently}} described oncogene jun shows significant amino acid sequence homology with the GCN 4 yeast transcriptional activator protein. The similarity is restricted to the 66 carboxyl-terminal amino acids, {{thought to be the}} DNA-binding domain of the GCN 4 protein. In these alpha-helix-permissive regions of the jun and GCN 4 products there is also a lesser but still significant amino acid resemblance to the fos protein and a marginal degree of similarity to myc proteins. The amino acid sequence homology between GCN 4 and jun gene products suggests that the <b>jun</b> <b>protein</b> may bind to DNA in a sequence-specific way and exert a regulatory function...|$|E
40|$|The DNA binding {{activity}} of the c-jun proto-oncogene product is inhibited by oxidation of a specific cysteine residue (Cys- 252) in the DNA binding domain. <b>Jun</b> <b>protein</b> inactivated by oxidation of this residue can be efficiently reactivated by a factor from human cell nuclei, recently identified as a DNA repair enzyme (termed HAP 1 or Ref- 1). The HAP 1 protein consists of a core domain, which is highly conserved {{in a family of}} prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA repair enzymes, and a 61 -amino-acid N-terminal domain absent from bacterial homologs such as Escherichia coli exonuclease III. The eukaryote-specific N-terminal domain was dispensable for the DNA repair functions of the HAP 1 protein but was essential for reactivation of the DNA binding {{activity of}} oxidized <b>Jun</b> <b>protein.</b> Consistent with this finding, exonuclease III protein could not reactive Jun. A minimal 26 -residue region of the N-terminal domain proximal to the core of the HAP 1 enzyme was required for redox activity. By site-directed mutagenesis, cysteine 65 was identified as the redox active site in the HAP 1 enzyme. In addition, it is proposed that cysteine 93 interacts with the redox active site, probably via disulfide bridge formation. It is concluded that the HAP 1 protein has evolved a novel redox activation domain capable of regulating the DNA binding activity of a proto-oncogene product which is not essential for its DNA repair functions. Identification of a putative active site cysteine residue should facilitate analysis of the mechanism by which the HAP 1 protein may alter the redox state {{of a wide range of}} transcription factors...|$|E
40|$|BRCA 1 is {{involved}} in the regulation of multiple nuclear events including transcription. AD 1, one of the two trans-activation domains in BRCA 1, stimulates transcription in a cell context-dependent manner. Here, it is shown that BRCA 1 interacts with <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> via a coiled-coil motif in AD 1 and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) region of the <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins.</b> The Jun-interacting domain in BRCA 1 is critical for AD 1 -mediated transcriptional activation. In particular, the strength of AD 1 in transcriptional activation is limited by the JunB level and ectopic expression of JunB potentiates the transcriptional activity of AD 1. Furthermore, JunB mRNA expression is down-regulated in many ovarian tumor tissues examined. Thus, the coiled-coil-mediated cooperation between BRCA 1 and JunB may facilitate the function of these proteins in tissue-specific transcriptional regulation and tumor suppression...|$|R
40|$|The mouse skin {{model that}} has been used to study skin {{carcinogenesis}} can be divided into three stages: initiation, promotion, and progression. One genetic change observed during tumor promotion and malignant progression is increased transactivation of the transcription factor AP- 1. AP- 1 consists of Jun (c-Jun, Jun B, Jun D) and Fos (c-Fos, Fos B, Fra- 1, Fra- 2) proteins that form Jun:Jun homodimers or Jun:Fos heterodimers. AP- 1 binds to a consensus cis-promoter element, the TRE, and transcriptionally regulate a number of genes with various biological functions. By studying the benign mouse keratinocyte cells, 308, and its malignant variant, 10 Gy 5, {{it has been shown that}} 10 Gy 5 cells have elevated AP- 1 activity compared to 308 cells. Reduced AP- 1 transactivation in 10 Gy 5 cells has been correlated with suppression of its malignant phenotype. This research examined the differential AP- 1 transactivation in benign 308 and malignant 10 Gy 5 cells. By examing mechanisms of AP- 1 regulation in the two cell lines, differences were observed with post-translational modifications of AP- 1. There were differences in phosphorylation of one of the AP- 1 family members, Jun B. In addition, AP- 1 proteins in 10 Gy 5 cells appear to be in a fully reduced state, unlike AP- 1 proteins in 308 cells. A third difference that was observed was in Jun B steady state protein levels, with decreased <b>Jun</b> B <b>protein</b> in malignant 10 Gy 5 compared to benign 308 cells. Reduced <b>Jun</b> B <b>protein</b> in 10 Gy 5 cells was the result of decreased <b>Jun</b> B <b>protein</b> synthesis. <b>Jun</b> B <b>protein</b> may inhibit AP- 1 transactivation and cell proliferation. Experiments were performed to determine whether <b>Jun</b> B <b>protein</b> could modulate AP- 1 transactivation, cell growth, and tumor formation in 308 and 10 Gy 5 cells. Altering <b>Jun</b> B <b>protein</b> levels in these keratinocytes affected AP- 1 transactivation. Overexpression of <b>Jun</b> B <b>protein</b> in malignant 10 Gy 5 cells corresponded to an inhibition of cell growth and tumor development. However, overexpression of <b>Jun</b> B <b>protein</b> in 10 Gy 5 cells was not sufficient to reverse the malignancy, indicating that additional genetic changes are involved in malignant conversion of these keratinocytes.

The extent of crosslinking is about eight times greater than that observed with standard oligodeoxynucleotides and amounts to 30 - 50 % of the efficiency of non-covalent association as estimated by gel-shift assays. Crosslinking is reversed by incubation with NaCN. The crosslinking reaction is specific [...] a dumbbell oligonucleotide with six phosphorothioate groups introduced into the Sp 1 recognition sequence could not be crosslinked efficiently to CREB or <b>JUN</b> <b>proteins</b> with K 2 PtCl 4.

In this study, properties of Jun required for trans-adivation and transformation were explored by replacing the trans-adivation domains of c-Jun and its oncogenic counterpart, v-Jun, with the constitutively adive trans-adivation domain from the herpes simplex virus VP 1 6 protein.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} that retinoic acid can down-regulate transcriptional activation by the nuclear protooncogene c-jun. All {{three members of}} the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) subfamily (RAR alpha, RAR beta, and RAR gamma) can repress transcriptional induction of the human collagenase gene or a heterologous promoter that contains the collagenase promoter AP- 1 -binding site. In contrast, the retinoid X receptor fails to repress Jun/AP- 1 activity, demonstrating {{a significant difference between the}} two regulatory systems through which retinoids exert their transcriptional control. Analysis of RAR alpha mutants in transfection studies reveals that the DNA-binding domain is important for the inhibition of Jun/AP- 1 activity, even though the RAR does not bind the collagenase AP- 1 site. Rather, gel-retardation assays reveal that bacterially expressed full-length RAR alpha inhibits binding of <b>Jun</b> <b>protein</b> to target DNA. These data suggest that the RAR alpha may form a nonproductive complex with c-Jun and provides a simple mechanisms by which retinoic acid may limit cell growth and possibly malignant progression...|$|E
40|$|Proto-oncogenes play an {{important}} role in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. C-Jun activity has been studied in the testis of a non mammalian vertebrate, the lizard Podarcis s. sicula, during two different periods: winter stasis and the breeding season. C-Jun protein was localized by immunocytochemistry in the cytoplasm of the spermatogonia (SPG) and stage I and II spermatocytes (SPC) during the winter stasis (from December until March), while the protein was present in the nuclei of the same cells during the active spermatogenic period (April/May). The different localization of c-Jun has been confirmed by Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis. In addition, when Jun is present in the nuclear compartment, it is phosphorylated on Ser- 63 and is complexed with Fos protein. These data suggest that the nuclear localization of the <b>Jun</b> <b>protein</b> in the SPG and stage I and II SPC, with strong phosphorylation on Ser- 63 during the breeding period, could be the signal of increasing transcriptional activity in the Lizard testis...|$|E

The numbers of these cells {{that are in the}} cell cycle gradually decreases up to 45 cumulative population doublings (cPD), thereafter the decline is steeper, until almost all cells enter a post-mitotic state by 60 cPD. We observed that a 34 kd junB species began to replace the 44 kd junB species after 41 cPD. This was followed, after 44 cPD, by a loss of fra 1 and both junD species. After 49 cPD there was a gradual decline in the levels of fos and <b>jun</b> <b>proteins,</b> but disproportionately, so that the fos/jun protein ratio also declined. Although fos and <b>jun</b> <b>proteins</b> were still clearly present at 60 cPD, utilisation of the AP- 1 DNA consensus sequence could not be demonstrated after 54 cPD.

40|$|BATF is {{a member}} of the AP- 1 (activator protein- 1) family of bZIP (basic leucine zipper) {{transcription}} factors that form transcriptionally inhibitory, DNA binding heterodimers with <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins.</b> In the present study, we demonstrate that BATF is phosphorylated in vivo on multiple serine and threonine residues and at least one tyrosine residue. Reverse-polarity PAGE revealed that serine- 43 and threonine- 48 within the DNA binding domain of BATF are phosphorylated. To model phosphorylation of the BATF DNA binding domain, serine- 43 was replaced by an aspartate residue. BATF(S 43 D) retains the ability to dimerize with <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> in vitro and in vivo, and the BATF(S 43 D) :Jun heterodimer localizes properly to the nucleus of cells. Interestingly, BATF(S 43 D) functions like wild-type BATF to reduce AP- 1 -mediated gene transcription, despite the observed inability of the BATF(S 43 D) :Jun heterodimer to bind DNA. These data demonstrate that phosphorylation of serine- 43 converts BATF from a DNA binding into a non-DNA binding inhibitor of AP- 1 activity. Given that 40 % of mammalian bZIP transcription factors contain a residue analogous to serine- 43 of BATF in their DNA binding domains, the phosphorylation event described here represents a mechanism that is potentially applicable to the regulation of many bZIP proteins...|$|R

Furthermore, interaction of 6 of the 10 proteins with Jun was observed in cultured cells by means of co-immunoprecipitation and observation of subcellular localization.

Here, we have studied the expression of their proteins using antibodies to Fos and Jun. Western blotting disclosed two immunoreactive bands for the anti-Fos antibody (47 and 54 kD) and two immunoreactive bands for the anti-Jun antibody (39 and 54 kD).

Staining for <b>Jun</b> <b>protein</b> was significantly greater in the right LPO of trained chicks (P < 0. 01). Other forebrain regions showed no increase over quiet control levels.

40|$|The viral <b>Jun</b> <b>protein</b> (v-Jun) {{transforms}} chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) {{more effectively}} than its cellular counterpart (c-Jun). In certain cell types v-Jun is also a stronger transcriptional activator than c-Jun. These functional differences between v-Jun and c-Jun result from a deletion in v-Jun (referred to as "delta deletion") that seems to weaken the interaction of Jun with a negative cellular regulator molecule. These observations suggested that the oncogenicity of v-Jun {{may be due to}} an enhanced ability to activate transcription of target genes. To test this hypothesis, we constructed several deletions in the delta domain of chicken c-Jun and determined their transforming and transactivating properties. Surprisingly, we found an inverse correlation between the ability of the mutants to transform CEF and to transactivate the collagenase and transin promoters in CEF. In contrast, there was no significant effect of the delta mutations in c-Jun on transactivation in F 9 murine embryonal carcinoma cells. The function of the delta region is therefore cell-type specific. The inverse correlation between transformation and transactivation in CEF suggests that the strong growth-promoting effect of v-Jun may be related to a failure to activate the transcription of growth attenuating genes...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{activity}} of the AP- 1 site, a target for the Fos and Jun family of transcription factors, {{in the context of the}} human stromelysin promoter (- 1303 to + 4). In transiently transfected human HepG 2, HeLa and fibroblast cell cultures, point-mutations in any position of the stromelysin AP- 1 sequence TGAGTCA (- 70 to - 64) reduced both the basal level and TPA-induced expression from the stromelysin promoter. TPA-induction fold of the mutant promoters, however, was comparable to that of the wild-type promoter. Similarly, antisense c-Fos mRNA expression reduced basal activity but had no significant effect on the relative TPA-response of the stromelysin promoter. Further, in mouse F 9 cells cotransfected with c-Fos and c-Jun expression plasmids, the transfected wild-type stromelysin promoter activity was increased 57 -fold whereas no transactivation was detected for an AP- 1 mutant stromelysin promoter. In gelshift assays, stromelysin promoter fragments (- 101 to - 11), containing the mutated AP- 1 site, all failed to bind or compete for the in vitro synthesized Fos and <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins.</b> We interpret these data to suggest that the Fos and <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins,</b> or similar activity, and the AP- 1 site are required for the basal level expression of the human stromelysin gene. Strikingly, these data also suggest that the stromelysin AP- 1 site is not necessary for the TPA-response...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{transcription}} of the {{insulin gene}} in pancreatic beta cells is regulated by its enhancer, located between nucleotides - 340 and - 91 {{relative to the}} transcription start site. One of the principal control elements within the enhancer is found between nucleotides - 100 and - 91 (GCCATCTGCT, {{referred to as the}} insulin control element [ICE]) and is regulated by both positive- and negative-acting transcription factors in the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family. It was previously shown that the c-jun proto-oncogene can repress insulin gene transcription. We have found that c-jun inhibits ICE-stimulated transcription. Inhibition of ICE-directed transcription is mediated by sequences within the carboxy-terminal region of the protein. These c-jun sequences span an activation domain and the basic leucine zipper DNA binding-dimerization region of the protein. Both regions of c-jun are conserved within {{the other members of the}} jun family: junB and junD. These proteins also suppress ICE-mediated transcription. The <b>jun</b> <b>proteins</b> do not appear to inhibit insulin gene transcription by binding directly to the ICE. c-jun and junB also block the trans-activation potential of two skeletal muscle-specific HLH proteins, MyoD and myogenin. These results suggests that the <b>jun</b> <b>proteins</b> may be common transcription control factors used in skeletal muscle and pancreatic beta cells to regulate HLH-mediated activity. We discuss the possible significance of these observations to insulin gene transcription in pancreatic beta cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of specific reagents to measure gene activity has provided important tools and potential {{new directions for}} the study of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation in vivo. In this report, we have measured steady-state mRNA levels of several fos and jun family members in aortic tissue by Northern blotting after vascular injury. In addition, protein products of these genes were analyzed by immunocytochemistry. Within 15 minutes of balloon injury, mRNA levels of c-fos, fosB, c-jun, junB, and junD were elevated severalfold. In contrast, fos-related antigen (fra- 1) mRNA showed a delayed onset of expression. The expression kinetics of these immediate early genes was similar to those in cultured cells stimulated to undergo proliferation by growth factors, suggesting that such SMC gene activation in vivo reflects permeation of blood-derived growth factors into the vessel wall or intravascular release of preformed growth factors. Translation of fos and jun genes into immunoreactive products was demonstrated 2 hours after balloon injury with antisera to Fos and <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins.</b> Treating rats with cycloheximide abolished this immunoreactivity. The distribution of Fos and Jun products was concentrated in SMC nuclei at the luminal border of the rat aorta. Such focal expression may have consequences for the initiation of SMC DNA synthesis and migration after vascular injury. Furthermore, the expression of Fos and <b>Jun</b> <b>proteins</b> in SMC after vascular balloon injury may be used as an index of SMC activation under a variety of experimental settings...|$|R
