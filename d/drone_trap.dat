40|$|Given {{reports of}} declines in populations of pollinators globally, it is {{increasingly}} important to develop efficient procedures to assess the density and distribution of honey bee colonies in both agricultural and natural landscapes. One such procedure utilises the fact that drone honey bees from different colonies congregate in mating leks {{where they can be}} conveniently sampled. Genetic analysis of the captured drones can determine the number of colonies contributing to the sampled population. Here, through the use of sampling distributions derived from an agent-based model, we provide an improved procedure for estimating the density of colonies from the number of unique colonies identified from the sampled drones. We present simulations for different spatial environments and densities, and show that the number of unique colonies observed in a sample of drones collected at a <b>drone</b> <b>trap</b> covaries with the density of colonies in range of the sampled drone congregation area in a log-linear manner. As a consequence of this relationship, we find that colony densities from past surveys are likely to be lower than previously reported...|$|E

50|$|Limited {{drone brood}} cell method limits the brood space cell for Varroa mites to inhabit (4.9 mm across — about 0.5 mm smaller than standard), and also enhances the {{difference}} in size between worker and drone brood, {{with the intention of}} making the <b>drone</b> comb <b>traps</b> more effective in trapping Varroa mites. Small cell foundations have staunch advocates, though controlled studies have been generally inconclusive.|$|R
40|$|Animal Spirits is {{multi-channel}} video {{portrait of}} key personalities {{involved in the}} Global Financial Crisis. The four-screen installation displays these twelve decapitated apostles of free-market economic theory in a tableau of <b>droning</b> pontification. <b>Trapped</b> in a purgatorial loop, they endlessly spout vague and obfuscating explanations and defenses of their ideologies and (in) actions. The work takes a creatively quotidian approach to understanding the language of economics and the financial services industry. Through its endless loop of sound, image, and spoken text, the installation examines some of the ideas, narratives and power dynamics that foster and reward hubris and greed...|$|R
5000|$|Legion, a live-action {{television}} series, premiered on FX in 2017. Produced by 20th Century Fox Television and Marvel Television, {{the series}} {{takes place in}} a warped reality (depicted as perceived by the titular character) and runs [...] "parallel" [...] to the X-Men film universe, with further connections to take place in season two. Rachel Keller plays Sydney Barrett who's [...] "a scrappy, optimistic woman in her 20s", and will demonstrate powers that are [...] "tied to human touch", much like X-Men mainstay, Rogue. In February 2016, Dan Stevens was cast as the eponymous lead character, and Aubrey Plaza, Jean Smart, Jeremie Harris, Amber Midthunder, Jemaine Clement, and Katie Aselton also landed lead roles in the program. The series was picked up by FX in early 2017 with 8 episodes. In the series premiere, David is captured from the Clockworks mental facility, where he has been since a suicide attempt, by an anti-mutant government unit known as Division 3 which wants to harness David's abilities for themselves. David is rescued by a team of rogue mutants and taken to the [...] "Summerland" [...] training facility, where he develops a romantic relationship with body-swapping mutant Sydney Barrett (Rachel Keller). In [...] "Chapter 7", David learns that his biological father is a powerful psychic mutant whose nemesis the Shadow King has lived in his mind like a mental parasite since he was a little boy. In the episode [...] "Chapter 8", Shadow King is able to leap from David's body and ends up possessing the body of fellow psychic mutant Oliver Bird (Jemaine Clement), and promptly drives away from Summerland. In the episode's coda, a sphere-like <b>drone</b> <b>traps</b> David inside it and absconds with him.|$|R
5000|$|Christopher Lowe (Ian Bannen) is a {{frustrated}} middle management <b>drone</b> <b>trapped</b> in a loveless marriage with Mabel (Diana Dors). Bullied by his wife, and shown no respect by his son, he befriends Jim Underwood (Donald Pleasence) an old soldier now scratching {{out a living}} as a match and shoe lace seller.In an effort to impress, Lowe tells Underwood that he is a decorated soldier. To back up this lie, he tries to persuade the Proprietor to sell him a Distinguished Service Order medal. When the Proprietor asks that Lowe provide the certificate to prove he had previously been awarded the medal, Lowe steals the medal. Underwood is impressed by the medal, and asks Lowe to come to his house for tea. Once there he meets Underwood's daughter, Emily (Angela Pleasence). Over time Lowe is seduced by Emily's frankly rather creepy charms, and they start an affair.Emily then produces a miniature doll of Mabel, and holds a knife to it. She asks Lowe to order her to do his will. Lowe agrees that she should cut the doll. When she does, a drop of blood appears from its mouth. A disturbed Lowe dashes home to find Mabel dead. Underwood and Emily then appear at Lowe's home, and walk in {{to the sound of the}} wedding march.Later, Emily and Lowe are married. Lowe's son (played by the future writer John O'Farrell) and Jim Underwood attend the wedding. When the time comes to cut the cake, Emily asks all present whether they wish her to. They all agree and Emily brings the knife down, but rather than cut the cake, she cuts into the head of the decorative groom on top. Blood pours out of it, and Lowe falls on to the table, dead. Underwood and Emily explain to Lowe's son that they always answer the prayers of a child [...] "in one way or another".|$|R
40|$|During recent decades, a rapid {{increase}} in available data sources has enabled researchers to develop hundreds of new remote sensing applications: data provided by new sensors attached to satellites, aircrafts and drones. However, a major challenge remains unresolved: how to transfer the knowledge of these technological advances to conservation practitioners and facilitate access to the remote sensing products that are currently available. In this volume, we illustrate the ability of new technologies, such as <b>drones,</b> camera <b>traps</b> or miniaturized sensors, to enhance our information on habitat condition, species occurrence, invasive species mapping or biodiversity. There are several case studies from Natura 2000 and LTER sites: these were {{designed to meet the}} requirements of the EC Birds and Habitats Directives and the commitments associated with the EU Biodiversity Strategy, including regular habitat assessments. The authors of this volume, who work for different conservation and research agencies, provide a practical perspective on how remote sensing applications can benefit these long-term monitoring or surveillance programs. With these requirements in mind, the time is now right for conservation ecologists, researchers, technicians, managers, policy makers and practitioners to embrace the new technologies and products that are available from the remote sensing community...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractApis mellifera is an {{important}} pollinator but is sometimes associated with adverse effects on natural ecosystems. We surveyed pairs of disturbed and undisturbed sites across three biomes in South East Australia. We used pheromone lures to <b>trap</b> <b>drones,</b> genotyped the drones to infer the number of colonies within flight range and then estimated colony densities using synthetic sampling distributions. Estimated colony densities ranged from 0. 1 to 1. 5 colonies km− 2 and significantly lower in agricultural land relative to national parks. We suggest that colony density may be lower in disturbed than ‘natural’ areas due to the reduced availability of nest sites and possibly pesticide usage. Because the number of colonies recommended for adequate pollination is 100 – 1000 colonies km− 2, there are insufficient bees to provide optimal crop pollination in the areas we surveyed...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOlder larvae of {{honeybee}} drones are {{fed with}} a diet containing pollen. It {{is not known}} how pollen deprivation during the larval development of drones might affect their reproductive quality. This study investigated ejaculation ability and semen quality in drones reared in colonies with limited (LP) and unlimited (ULP) access to pollen. Access to pollen was limited by pollen <b>traps.</b> <b>Drone</b> brood rearing was not instantly abandoned in colonies with limited access to pollen. Colonies from the LP group reared drones with smaller mass, which ejaculated in fewer numbers and released smaller amounts of semen. The LP and ULP {{groups did not differ}} in semen quality as judged by the concentration, number, and viability of spermatozoa in ejaculate. It was found that access to pollen during larval development directly affects the reproductive quality of drones...|$|R
40|$|Rodents remain one of {{the most}} {{widespread}} and damaging invasive alien species on islands globally. The current toolbox for insular rodent eradications is reliant on the application of sufficient anticoagulant toxicant into every potential rodent territory across an island. Despite significant advances in the use of these toxicants over recent decades, numerous situations remain where eradication is challenging or not yet feasible. These include islands with significant human populations, unreceptive stakeholder communities, co-occurrence of livestock and domestic animals, or vulnerability of native species. Developments in diverse branches of science, particularly the medical, pharmaceutical, invertebrate pest control, social science, technology and defense fields offer potential insights into the next generation of tools to eradicate rodents from islands. Horizon scanning is a structured process whereby current problems are assessed against potential future solutions. We undertook such an exercise to identify the most promising technologies, techniques and approaches that might be applied to rodent eradications from islands. We highlight a Rattus-specific toxicant, RNA interference as species-specific toxicants, rodenticide research, crab deterrent in baits, prophylactic treatment for protection of non-target species, transgenic rodents, virus vectored immunocontraception, <b>drones,</b> self-resetting <b>traps</b> and toxicant applicators, detection probability models and improved stakeholder community engagement methods. We present a brief description of each method, and discuss its application to rodent eradication on islands, knowledge gaps, challenges, whether it is incremental or transformative in nature and provide a potential timeline for availability. We outline how a combination of new tools may render previously intractable rodent eradication problems feasible...|$|R
50|$|Issue #1 {{opens with}} an unnamed man demonstrating a new {{automated}} security drone. It cuts to Mal, Zoe, and Jayne robbing an art gallery, with Simon advising {{on the value}} of the works. While trying to escape in a delivery van, the four attract the attention of the security drone, which chases them; when the van is destroyed, the thieves are shown to be using their hovercraft 'Mule'. Mal and company lead the <b>drone</b> into a <b>trap,</b> where it is disabled by Kaylee: the drone is the Serenity crew's actual target. Meanwhile, Inara is with a client: Ephraim, an Alliance special operations agent tasked with hunting down Independent terrorists known as 'Dust Devils'. Mal delivers the drone to his client, and in exchange for the vital component, the man tells them of a stash of money hidden in a temple by a gang whose members killed each other before they could collect it. The crew retrieve the cash without incident, but on checking it, realise there is significantly more than they expected.|$|R
