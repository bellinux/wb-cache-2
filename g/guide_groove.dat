The performance of axial flow turbines is affected by losses from secondary flows that result in entropy generation. Reducing these secondary flow losses improves the turbine performance. This paper investigates the effect of applying a non-axisymmetric contour to the hub of a representative one-and-half stage axial turbine on the turbine performance. An analytical end-wall hub surface definition with a <b>guide</b> <b>groove</b> is used to direct the pressure side branch of the horseshoe vortex away from the blade suction side, so to retard its interaction with the suction side secondary flow and thus decrease the losses. This groove design is a development of the concept outlined in Obaida et al. (2016). A baseline three-dimensional steady RANS k-ω SST model, with axisymmetric walls, is validated against reference experimental measurements from a one-and-half stage turbine at the Institute of Jet Propulsion and Turbomachinery at RWTH Aachen, Germany. The CFD predictions of the non-axisymmetric hub with the <b>guide</b> <b>groove</b> show a decrease in the total pressure loss coefficient. The design work-flow is generated using the Alstom Process and Optimisation Workbench (APOW), which sensibly reduced the designer workload. The implementation of the <b>guide</b> <b>groove</b> has excellent portability to the turbomachinery industry and this makes this method promising for delivering the UK energy agenda through more efficient power turbines.

In {{the imaging}} process, the {{deformation}} {{of the plate}} caused by {{the structure of the}} drum, finally affecting the quality of the plate, we analyze and optimize the structure of the drum using the finite element method. Selecting the larger three factors affecting the plate deformation as the design variables, and taking minimizing the maximum deformation of the plate as the objective function, we establish the optimization model {{of the structure of the}} drum. We use the APDL parametrization language to create the geometric model and finite element model of the drum, and select the contact element to simulate the relationship between the plate and the surface of the drum, and use ANSYS software to optimize the optimization model. It is shown form the result that: the minimum of the maximum deformation of the drum getting from the 8 th iteration is 0. 0021535 mm, significantly reduced compared with the initial value 0. 002864 mm. At this point, the internal diameter D 2 of the drum is 300. 04 mm, the groove width L 2 is 14. 323 mm, the external diameter of groove height D 3 is 338. 44 mm. It indicates that that the smaller the internal diameter of the drum and the narrower the <b>guide</b> <b>groove</b> on the drum surface are, the smaller the maximum deformation of the plate is, and the <b>guide</b> <b>groove</b> height has little influence on the deformation.

The reciprocation trajectory of sliding block is collinear with the piston trajectory, while sliding block and piston move in the opposite direction, just like two opposite crank connecting rods.

The circular connecting rod is in the accurate guiding surface of the slider; and the guide pins are in the <b>guide</b> <b>groove.</b> Guide rod connects with supporting shaft through the guide hole of the slide. The optimized parameters for the sliding block show that the ratio of eccentric distance of the eccentric journal {{to the length of}} the connecting rod is equal to the ratio of crank radius to connecting rod length.

40|$|Improvements {{in stage}} {{isentropic}} efficiency and reductions in stage total pressure loss are sought in a 1. 5 stage axial turbine. This {{is representative of}} power generation equipment used in thermal power cycles, in a cryogenic plants, and in aeroderivative engines. The performance of cryogenic installations and of power plants can be enhanced by using turbines with a higher isentropic efficiency, by reducing the secondary flow losses. Secondary flow loss reduction is achieved by designing a non-axisymmetric end-wall for the turbine inlet stator hub. The approach {{is to use a}} novel <b>guide</b> <b>groove</b> to direct the pressure side branch of the horseshoe vortex away from the blade suction side, using a novel parametric end-wall hub surface definition. This delays the onset of the passage vortex and reduces its associated loss. The performance of the novel hub profile is compared with that from contouring the hub using representative industry best practice. For this, a three-dimensional steady RANS model with an axisymmetric hub is first validated against reference experimental measurements from RWTH Aachen. A Kriging surrogate model from the Alstom Process and Optimisation Workbench (APOW) is used to optimise the hub surface. Comparative CFD predictions with an optimised non-axisymmetric hub show a decrease in the stage total pressure loss coefficient and an increase in the stage isentropic efficiency at design and off-design. The potential benefits to a representative Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) cryogenic cycle is assessed by thermodynamic cycle analysis. A 1. 60...|$|E

The {{improvement of the}} aerodynamic performance for turbine blade tip is always continuing associated with {{the understanding of the}} leakage flowcharacteristic. Thus, a novel turbine blade tip, which is derived from the conventional squealer tip, is investigated numerically in this paper.

The results show that, first some part of the tip region flowsare forced to flow downstream along the <b>guided</b> <b>groove</b> formed by the recessed pressure side rim, which contributes to the preventing of the leakage mass flow and the descending of leakage loss as well. Besides,the blade loading of the novel geometry is raised than the traditional squealer tip, which reveals that the mass flow rate of the working fluid is increased. Third, the leakage mass flow is reduced so that the efficiency is increased.
