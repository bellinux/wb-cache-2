50|$|Despite Broaddrick’s denial in her affidavit, Jones’ lawyers {{included}} Yoakum’s {{letter and}} Broaddricks {{name in a}} 1998 filing. The letter suggested that the Clintons had bought Broaddrick’s silence, describing a phone call where Broaddrick’s husband asked Yoakum to say the incident never happened {{and said that he}} intended to ask Clinton “for a couple of big favors.” This, along with the discrepancy between the letter and Broaddrick’s affidavit, attracted the attention of independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who was investigating Clinton for obstruction of justice. After being approached by the FBI, Broaddrick consulted her son, a lawyer, who told her she could not lie to federal investigators. After Starr granted her immunity, thus assuring that she would not be prosecuted for perjury regarding her affidavit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jones</b> <b>case,</b> Broaddrick recanted the affidavit.

Later, at the Starr Grand Jury, Clinton stated that he believed the definition of sexual relations agreed upon for the Jones deposition excluded his receiving oral sex.

50|$|Crabtree Jones {{passed the}} house off to his son, Kimbrough Jones, along with a large estate. Kimbrough took this {{inheritance}} and greatly expanded it. According to the 1850 census, the Jones family's property was worth $18,619; by the 1860 census that number had risen to $50,000.

40|$|This past January, the Supreme Court held {{unanimously}} in United States v. Jones {{that the}} installation {{and use of}} a GPS tracker on a suspected drug dealer’s Jeep constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment. The outcome had been fairly well foreshadowed: at oral argument, the Justices had seemed perturbed {{by the thought that}} police could put trackers on cars — even the Justices’s own cars — seemingly at will, and there was a clear thread running through the questions that the practice smacked a little too much of George Orwell’s 1984. But the reasoning of the case was hotly disputed, with Justice Scalia and Justice Alito penning sparring opinions, and Justice Sotomayor contributing a separate concurrence. Justice Scalia’s opinion for the Court held that monitoring a suspect with a GPS device was a search because, by attaching the device to the car in the first place, the government had committed an act that would have constituted a trespass at common law. Justice Alito argued that the four-week monitoring was a search because it went on for too long. Amid this confusion, I wish to advance two critiques: First, that the majority opinion’s reliance on common law trespass norms enabled it to avoid making a reasoned normative pronouncement in the inadequately theorized area of electronic surveillance, and second, that its opinion, though claiming to adhere to precedent, did nothing of the kind. Instead, Justice Scalia formulated a new, trespassory test: a government intrusion constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment if the intrusion: (a) would have qualified as a trespass at common law, (b) invaded a constitutionally protected area enumerated in the Fourth Amendment, and (c) was committed for the purpose of gathering information. The Katz “reasonable expectation of privacy” inquiry was relegated to back-up status. But by insisting that the Court {{need look no further than}} his trespassory test, Justice Scalia avoided the only important question raised in this case — whether, in today 2 ̆ 7 s society, the actions of the police <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jones</b> <b>case</b> would have constituted a search, regardless of whether there was a trespass...|$|E
40|$|Where a party wrongfully suffers harm {{due to the}} {{negligent conduct}} of another, that harm is {{repaired}} through the payment of damages. In terms of the principle res perit domino, it is however a fundamental principle {{of the law of}} delict that a person should bear the loss he suffers. It stands to reason that where he contributes to his damages by his own negligent conduct, this should be taken into account and his damages reduced accordingly. The legal position regarding contributory negligence and the effect on recovery of damages, is governed by the Apportionment of Damages Act 34 of 1956. The relevance of the Act is often considered when dealing with the issue of liability; however, it ultimately effects the quantum of a damages award. This {{is not to say that}} the apportionment of liability will or should mirror the extent to which the damages are apportioned. In certain cases, damages may be further apportioned to account for other factors. In practice, the Act is often exercised incorrectly and differently from case to case, due to varying interpretations and approaches to underlying principles. The Act does not define concepts fundamental thereto nor does it prescribe an approach to determine the reduction of a party’s damages. Specifically the meaning of fault in the Act, whether this fault relates to the damage or damage-causing event, as well as how this fault should be measured and applied to the facts of each case have been interpreted and applied inconsistently. The highlight the various scenaria that have appeared in the practical application of the Act to claims arising out of delict and specifically, motor vehicle collisions. Through practical illustrations and case law, one can deliberate on the factors to be considered when a particular approach is adopted. It is ultimately necessary to determine whether the Act can be applied effectively and fairly, by adopting a single approach, or whether the law has to be revised. If the Act were to be reviewed, the extent to which negligent conduct is to be applied as well as how this is to be assessed should be clarified. It is necessary for courts to bear in mind that a person’s conduct as it is causally linked to harm, should be apportioned and a separate enquiry to extent to which harm is exacerbated by contributory negligence should be done. Mere negligent conduct is not sufficient – it must be linked to increased harm. As it stands, he approach followed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jones</b> <b>case</b> provides for a definable formula in which the parties’ conduct as it relates to the harm are assessed separately and then compared. If the comparative approach can be enforced, uniformity will be achieved and the uncertainty of discretionary application can be eliminated, even if the Act is not redrafted. If legal practitioners are able to clearly make this distinction and apportion the parts to which a claimant’s actions are related, the purpose of the Act can be achieved.
