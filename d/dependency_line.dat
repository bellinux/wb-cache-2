40|$|The {{dependencies}} {{between different}} business lines of banks have serious {{effects on the}} accuracy of operational risk estimation. Furthermore, the dependencies are far more complicated than simple linear correlation. While Pearson correlation coefficient is constructed based on the hypothesis of a linear association, the mutual information that measures all the information of a random variable contained in another random variable is a powerful alternative. Based on mutual information, the generalized correlation coefficient which can capture both linear and nonlinear correlation can be derived. This paper models the correlation between business lines by mutual information and normal copula.

40|$|The Feature–Oriented {{approach}} {{provides a}} way of modelling commonalities and variabilities among products of a software product line.

But, in the process of generating the architecture from a feature model, several crosscutting variables features and dependencies between features are commonly found from a feature-oriented analysis.

40|$|The APIs {{mechanical}} properties particularly, tabletability and flowability are of significant {{interest in the}} drug dosage tabletting. Insights into the APIs mechanical behaviour not only assist {{in the selection of}} optimum tabletting process but the choice of suitable excipients for dosage blend. Prediction of the {{mechanical properties}} of seven solid forms was described in this study two of which were used at the initial stage to develop the model. The objective of the model is to test the reliability of applying molecular and crystallographic modelling to predict the slip behaviour of APIs which will provide a quick tool for observing the mechanical properties. Plane rugosity and interlock properties were calculated for the first time by taking the crystallographic properties of each compound. The prediction model comprises of three main components. Firstly, the identification of likely dislocation Burgers vectors based on lattice geometry and <b>dependency</b> to <b>line</b> dislocation; secondly, selection of slip planes for plastic deformation using the calculation of interplanar interactions, rugosity and surface energy and thirdly, characterisations of slip systems or propensity for cleavage and fracture.

40|$|In {{insurance}} and related industries including healthcare, {{it is common}} to have several outcome measures that the analyst wishes to understand using explanatory variables. For example, in automobile insurance, an accident may result in payments for damage to one’s own vehicle, damage to another party’s vehicle, or personal injury. It is also common to be interested in the frequency of accidents in addition to the severity of the claim amounts. This paper synthesizes and extends the literature on multivariate frequency-severity regression modeling with a focus on insurance industry applications. Regression models for understanding the distribution of each outcome continue to be developed yet there now exists a solid body of literature for the marginal outcomes. This paper contributes to this body of literature by focusing on the use of a copula for modeling the dependence among these outcomes; a major advantage of this tool is that it preserves the body of work established for marginal models. We illustrate this approach using data from the Wisconsin Local Government Property Insurance Fund. This fund offers insurance protection for (i) property; (ii) motor vehicle; and (iii) contractors’ equipment claims. In addition to several claim types and frequency-severity components, outcomes can be further categorized by time and space, requiring complex dependency modeling. We find significant dependencies for these data; specifically, we find that <b>dependencies</b> among <b>lines</b> are stronger than the dependencies between the frequency and average severity within each line...|$|R
40|$|We present {{three-dimensional}} (3 -D) {{simulations of}} rotationally induced line variability arising from complex circumstellar environment of classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) using {{the results of}} the 3 -D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of Romanova et al., who considered accretion onto a CTTS with a misaligned dipole magnetic axis with respect to the rotational axis. The density, velocity and temperature structures of the MHD simulations are mapped on to the radiative transfer grid, and corresponding line source function and the observed profiles of neutral hydrogen lines (H-beta, Pa-beta and Br-gamma) are computed using the Sobolev escape probability method. We study the <b>dependency</b> of <b>line</b> variability on inclination angles (i) and magnetic axis misalignment angles (Theta). By comparing our models with the Pa-beta profiles of 42 CTTS observed by Folha & Emerson, we find that models with a smaller misaligngment angle (Theta<~ 15 deg.) are more consistent with the observations which show that majority of Pa-beta are rather symmetric around the line centre. For a high inclination system with a small dipole misalignment angle (Theta ~ 15 deg.), only one accretion funnel (on the upper hemisphere) is visible to an observer at any given rotational phase. This can cause an anti-correlation of the line equivalent width in the blue wing (v 0) over a half of a rotational period, and a positive correlation over other half. We find a good overall agreement of the line variability behaviour predicted by our model and those from observations. (Abridged) Comment: 15 pages, 13 figures. Accepted for publication in MNRAS.

40|$|Empirical {{measurement}} of <b>dependency</b> between different <b>lines</b> of non-life insurance business {{remains an open}} problem. International regulatory requirements and accounting standards are moving towards increased disclosure of the variability of insurance liabilities. In estimating the variability, it is required to take diversification benefits into account, as it is generally believed that different lines of business are not perfectly dependent on one another.

In this article, we set forth some practical considerations in modeling dependency and diversification benefits under Australian regulatory environment.

In order {{to benefit from}} the detailed syntactic annotation in SynTagRus and facilitate the development of a Russian Resource Grammar (RRG) in the framework of Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), we need to convert the dependency structures into HPSG derivation trees. Our pilot study has shown that many of the constructions can be converted systematically with simple rules. In order to extend the depth and coverage of this conversion, we need to implement conversion heuristics that produce linguistically sound HPSG derivations. As a result we obtain a structured set of correspondences between MTT surface syntactic relations and HPSG phrasal types, which enable the cross-theoretical transfer of insightful syntactic analyses and formalized deep linguistic knowledge. The converted treebank SynTagRus++ is annotated with HPSG structures and of crucial importance to the RRG under development, as our goal is to ensure an optimal and efficient grammar engineering cycle through dynamic coupling of the treebank and the grammar. ...|$|R
