5|$|Matthew Fox, Dominic Monaghan and Jorge Garcia {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} the role of Sawyer, who at the time {{was supposed to be a}} suit-wearing city con man, but the role was given to Josh Holloway. Garcia was the first actor the producers knew they were going to cast. While the producers thought Garcia was spectacular, they did not think he fit in the role of Sawyer, so they created the Hurley character for him instead. When Holloway auditioned for Sawyer, the producers liked his southern accent and the edge he brought to the character (Holloway reportedly forgot his lines and kicked a chair in frustration). The producers knew he did not suit the role, but thought he was very watchable, so they rewrote the role to suit him, making him more feral, Southern, but kept the same intelligence he originally had. After appearing in The Lord of the Rings, Dominic Monaghan was offered many fantasy-based roles, like elves and pixies. He was keen to portray a different role, so he wanted a contemporary part that had layers and an edge. Originally Charlie was an older rocker that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit in the 1980s but now had a heroin addiction. After the producers enjoyed Monaghan's audition of Sawyer, they decided to cast him as Charlie and rewrote the script to make Charlie a young has-been instead.|$|E

25|$|Registration 1 {{sold for}} £7.25million {{and is the}} highest price paid for a plate – in the United Arab Emirates. It was {{purchased}} by Abu Dhabi businessman Saeed Abdul Ghaffar Khouri in 2008. As of 2014, the registration 25O broke a new record of being the highest priced plate sold at a DVLA auction. Registration 25O was purchased for £518,000 by Ferrari dealer John Collins in 2014; the plate now sits pride of place on a Ferrari 250 SWB once owned by rock star Eric Clapton. Registration F1 and RAC3R have been considered as the most desirable plates amongst supercar and Formula One fanatics. The registration RAC3R is a suffix style plate that was issued {{in the same year}} British racing driver James Hunt won the Formula One World Championship in 1976. The plate covers an endless list of all the different forms of racing, making it extremely desirable. Since there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> fuss over race related plates the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency has made a racer game for motorists to celebrate the huge profits made from the sales of private plates. The celebration took place at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2010. Unlike horse racing, Formula One racing has become more popular in the last few years, hence why the F1 plate was always going to sell well. On 25 January 2008 the registration F1 sold for £440,000 to Bradford Car design entrepreneur Afzal Kahn. The plate was previously owned and sold by Essex County Council and was sold to raise money for training young drivers. Today the F1 plate has a valuation less than the winning bid with the price tag stagnating on that particular plate. Originally the plate was affixed in 1904 to the Panhard et Levassor of the then County Surveyor. Previously, a few months before the F1 plate was purchased, the S1 plate sold for £397,500 at an auction in September 2007 by an anonymous buyer making it the second most expensive number plate ever sold in the UK. The S1 plate was originally owned by Sir John H A MacDonald, the Lord Kingsburgh and was Edinburgh's first ever number plate. Within the space of two years the S1 plate sold for £65,500 more than the M1 plate that sold at auction in Goodwood on 7 July 2006. Registrations 1D VIP1 51NGH K1NGS and 1O are also marked as considerably expensive plates that have sold publicly in excess of six figures.|$|E

2500|$|An {{air raid}} offense (predominantly passing-oriented with quarterback in shotgun {{formation}} usually with four wide receivers) coordinated by Leach, Washington State was projected {{to have one}} of its biggest advantages in the passing game, where junior quarterback Connor Halliday recorded 4187 passing yards, which was fourth in the country, on 656 passing attempts, which led the country by more than 50, for 28 touchdowns and 21 interceptions, the latter of which was most in the country. He spread the ball around to many different receivers; eight different receivers had more than 30 catches. The Cougars' leading receiver was sophomore Gabe Marks, who caught 69 passes for 770 yards and 6 touchdowns. Fellow sophomore Dom Williams caught 39 passes for 644 yards and a team-leading 7 touchdowns, [...] senior Vince Mayle caught 40 passes for 501 yards and 6 touchdowns, and freshman River Cracaft, an honorable mention all-conference honoree, caught 37 passes for 489 yards and 2 touchdowns. There were no tight ends on the roster. Washington State's offensive line was expected to be able to protect Halliday relatively easily, as Colorado State would have to drop a significant portion of its defense in to coverage, thus limiting its ability to blitz. Senior center Elliot Bosch, who was an honorable mention all-conference performer, anchored the offensive line, and was supported by fellow former walk-ons Gunnar Eklund, a sophomore left tackle, and Joe Dahl, a sophomore left guard. Leach commented on the group of walk-ons, specifically Bosch, noting, [...] "He’s developed his skills, worked really hard in the weight room and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> cornerstone for us. We wouldn’t be in a bowl game without him." [...] The Cougars' measly rushing attack, which averaged only 58.7 yards per game (123 out of 123 in the FBS), included junior Marcus Mason and sophomore Teondray Caldwell. Senior Andrew Furney, an honorable mention all-conference performer, handled the kicking duties, and made 15 of his 19 field goal tries with a long of 52 yards and 43 of his 44 extra point tries.|$|E
