500|$|The {{game was}} a {{milestone}} for one coach and a millstone for another; {{it was the}} 100th win for Mack Brown at Texas; and it put more pressure on beleaguered Nebraska coach Bill Callahan. [...] Brown remarked on his victory, “A hundred is nice. [...] I knew the game was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> like it did. [...] It didn’t surprise me. [...] They made sure that I’ll remember it {{the rest of my}} life.” [...] Callahan was fired fiveweeks later.|$|E
500|$|Though he was {{considered}} one of the front-runners, there was still much competition for one of the limited 2013 bullpen spots as a relief pitcher. His main competition was seen as Brett Cecil and J. A. Happ. John Gibbons said, [...] "How it best fits the team, how it all stacks up down there is really what it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to. But we're going to go with the best guy, not because guys are out of options." [...] Reportedly, Loup learned that he had acquired one of the bullpen spots when Gibbons walked by his locker and said, [...] "Oh, hey Loup—you made the team." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earlier, Goodell had {{indicated}} that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> hard on the players involved, telling Eisen that they [...] "enthusiastically embraced" [...] the scheme.

[...] On December 31, 2006, in a telecast debate on Fox News, Schiff forecast that [...] "what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen in 2007 is that real estate prices," [...] which had peaked in December 2005, [...] "are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> crashing back <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Earth." ...|$|R
25|$|By the {{following}} morning the city of Carrara was surrounded by soldiers {{under the command of}} General Nicola Heusch. A state of siege had been proclaimed by the Crispi government on January 16, 1894. Among those threatened with arrest were many quarry workers, who responded by declaring a general strike. Instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work, they <b>came</b> <b>down</b> from the mountains and gathered around the military barracks where hundreds of prisoners had already been detained. Troops were then ordered to amass and, as soon as the crowd came near enough, they fired. Eleven deaths resulted, as well as numerous other casualties. (Other sources mention 8 people killed and 13 wounded). Armed bands dispersed into the mountains pursued by troops.|$|R
2500|$|After the South Tower collapsed, NYPD {{helicopters}} relayed {{information about}} the deteriorating conditions of the North Tower. At 10:20am, the NYPD aviation unit reported that [...] "the {{top of the tower}} might be leaning", and a minute later reported that the North Tower, [...] "is buckling on the southwest corner and leaning to the south". At 10:28am, the aviation unit reported that [...] "the roof is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> very shortly". The North Tower collapsed at 10:28am, after burning for 102 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B-" [...] grade and wrote, [...] "Grimm {{has too many}} threads to follow right now, and it's painted itself into a corner where even a few great scenes that move the episodic plot along and tease out some details of the {{creature}} world leaves something out, and tonight that was the slow crawl of the season-long arc. There is very little narrative drive beyond a weekly case and some background information from Eddie Monroe. Once Upon A Time finds itself {{in a position where}} it's using flashbacks to serve a constant drive forward in an ongoing story, and not focusing as much on the episodic conflicts. Grimm is getting too bogged down in the Law & Order case-of-the-week and not providing enough in serialization. It's still in a state of flux, and doesn't quite know what it wants to be. I'm along for the ride, and any episode that features Silas Weir Mitchell in a bigger role can't be all bad, but 'Let Your Hair Down' is a warning sign that Grimm has too many plates in the air, and if it isn't careful, they're all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> tumbling <b>down</b> and make a huge mess." ...|$|R
50|$|Gordon {{got caught}} in lapped traffic and Harvick retook the lead on lap 58. Debris in turn three brought out the third caution on lap 72. Jimmie Johnson took the lead from Harvick during the pit cycle. Johnson led the field to the green on the restart and Kyle Busch, who {{restarted}} sixth, did not get <b>going</b> and had <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> pit road due to a burnt left-rear wheel hub. Joey Logano took the lead from Johnson on the restart, for the sixth lead change of the race on lap 80, before Johnson retook the lead from Logano on lap 93. David Ragan brought out the fourth caution of the race on lap 102 for a spin in turn four, and Harvick retook the lead during the pit cycle and led the field to the restart on lap 108. Alex Bowman brought out the fifth caution on lap 110, when he hit the wall in turn two.|$|R
6000|$|I {{remember}} too how I dined {{alone that}} evening {{in a mood}} between frantic exasperation and utter abasement {{in the window of}} the Mediated Universities Club, of which I was a junior member under the undergraduate rule. And I lay awake all night in one of the austere club bedrooms, saying to old Pramley a number of extremely able and penetrating things that had unhappily not occurred to me during the progress of our interview. I didn't go back to Burnmore for several days. I had set my heart on achieving something, on returning with some earnest of the great attack I was to make upon the separating great world between myself and Mary. I am far enough off now from that angry and passionate youngster to smile at the thought that my subjugation of things in general and high finance in particular took at last the form of proposing to go into the office of Bean, Medhurst, Stockton, and Schnadhorst upon half commission terms. I was awaiting my father's reply to this startling new suggestion when I got a telegram from Mary. [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Scotland unexpectedly. <b>Come</b> <b>down</b> and see me." [...] I went home instantly, and told my father I had <b>come</b> <b>to</b> talk things over with him. A note from Mary lay upon the hall-table as I came in and encountered my father. [...] "I thought it better <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> you," [...] I said with my glance roving to find that, and then I met his eye. It wasn't altogether an unkindly eye, but I winced dishonestly.|$|R

6000|$|As a moralist March was flattered to be hoist {{with his}} own petard, but as a husband he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> at once. [...] "I thought {{probably}} you had told her that. You had it pat from having just been over it with me. When has she heard from him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|My mother {{smiled at}} this jest, but my father, still loyal to Dakota, {{was quick to}} defend it. [...] "I like it out there," [...] he insisted. [...] "I like wheat raising on a big scale. I don't know how I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> from {{operating}} a six-horse header to scraping with a hoe in a garden patch." ...|$|E

50|$|To {{cause the}} kit of pigeons <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down,</b> from their flight, either an {{acoustic}} signal, a visual signal or a dropper pigeon is used. Every fancier trains his pigeons <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> using his chosen signal. Basically the pigeons {{are trained to}} associate the signal with feeding time. They typically must be well-trained and hungry in order <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> when the signal is given.|$|R

6000|$|Christina {{went on with}} a sort of infernal calmness: [...] "I believe that, really, {{you don't}} greatly care for your friend in America any more than you do for me. You are {{one of the men who}} care only for {{themselves}} and for what they can make of themselves. That 's very well when they can make something great, and I could interest myself in a man of extraordinary power who should wish to turn all his passions to account. But if the power should turn out to be, after all, rather ordinary? Fancy feeling one's self ground in the mill of a third-rate talent! If you have doubts about yourself, I can't reassure you; I have too many doubts myself, about everything in this weary world. You have gone up like a rocket, in your profession, they tell me; are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> like the stick? I don't pretend to know; I repeat frankly what I have said before--that all modern sculpture seems to me weak, and that the only things I care for are some of the most battered of the antiques of the Vatican. No, no, I can't reassure you; and when you tell me--with a confidence in my discretion of which, certainly, I am duly sensible--that at times you feel terribly small, why, I can only answer, 'Ah, then, my poor friend, I am afraid you are small.' The language I should like to hear, from a certain person, would be the language of absolute decision." ...|$|E
