They {{start with an}} initial guess of the solution over the entire time interval of interest, andproduce iteratively better andbetter approximations tothesolutionover theentire time interval at once. Description 2 Classical Waveform Relaxation Methods Waveform relaxation algorithms were invented for circuit simulation [9]. The idea is to partition large scale circuits into subcircuits, as shown for the historical MOS-Ring oscillator from [9] in Figure 1. Using Kirchhoff’s and Ohm’s laws, one obtains a system Fig. 1. Historical example of a waveform relaxation decomposition of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form <b>dv</b> 1 <b>dt</b> = f 1 (v 1,v 2,v 3), <b>dv</b> 2 <b>dt</b> = f 2 (v 1,v 2,v 3), <b>dv</b> 3 <b>dt</b> = f 3 (v 1,v 2,v 3). (1) for the unknown voltages v 1, v 2, v 3. When the circuit is partitioned into subcircuits, coupling terms are replaced by artificial sources, providing signals from the previous iteration, as shown in Figure 1 on the right. This relaxation of signals, called waveforms inthecommunity, ledtothenamewaveformrelaxation. Mathematically, thisrelaxation corresponds for given initial waveforms v 0 1 (t), v 0 2 (t), v 0 3 (t) to the iteration dvk 1 dt = f 1 (v k 1,vk− 1 2,v k− 1 3), <b>dv</b> k 2 <b>dt</b> = f 2 (v k 1,vk 2,vk− 1 3), dvk 3 dt = f 3 (v k 1,vk 2,vk 3), k = 1, 2, [...] ., (2) which is like a Gauss-Seidel method for linear systems, and is thus called Gauss-Seidel waveform relaxation. Naturally also a more parallel Jacobi waveform relaxation can be used. Waveform relaxation methods are very much related to the classical method of successive approximations by Picard in 1890 [16], where all arguments on the rightin (2) would be taken at iteration index k − 1, and they have similar convergence properties: convergence is superlinear, i. e. 3 ||v k −v| | ≤ (CT) ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this note}} we {{consider}} the perfect integrator driven by Poisson process input. We derive its equilibrium and response properties and contrast them to the approximations obtained by applying the diffusion approximation. In particular, the probability density {{in the vicinity of}} the threshold differs, which leads to altered response properties of the system in equilibrium. Stationary solution of perfect integrator with excitation The membrane potential V of the perfect integrator [Tuckwell, 1988] evolves according to the stochastic differential equation <b>dV</b> <b>dt</b> = w i δ(t − ti), where ti are random time points of synaptic impulses events generated by a Poisson process with rate λ and w is the magnitude is the voltage change caused by an incoming event. If V reaches the threshold Vθ the neuron emits an action potential. After the threshold crossing, the voltage is reset to V ← V − (Vθ−Vr). This reset preserves the overshoot above threshold and places the system above the reset value by this amount. Biophysically the reset is motivated by considering each δ-impulse as the limit of a current extended in time. If V crosses Vθ within such a pulse, after the reset to Vr the remainder of the pulse’s charge causes a depolarization starting from Vr. We consider a population of identical neurons and assume a uniformly distributed membrane voltage between reset and threshold initially. In what follows we apply the formalism outlined in Helias et al. [2010]. The first and second infinitesimal moment [Ricciardi et al., 1999] of the diffusion approximation are A 1 = λw def = µ A 2 = λw 2 def = σ 2.

40|$|Time {{evolution}} of tunneling in thermal medium is examined using the real-time semiclassical formalism previously developed. Effect of anharmonic {{terms in the}} potential well is shown to give a new mechanism of resonance enhanced tunneling. If the friction from environment is small enough, this mechanism may give a very large enhancement for the tunneling rate. The case of the asymmetric wine bottle potential is worked out in detail. 1 In our previous paper [1] we formulated within the semiclassical framework {{how to deal with}} the real-time dynamics of tunneling that takes place in thermal medium. In the present work we further analyze the problem and discover a new mechanism of enhanced tunneling caused by anharmonic terms in the potential well. The result may have great relevance to the old (once failed) scenario of inflation based on the first order phase transition [2], and to the scenario of electroweak baryogenesis [3]. We start from recapitulating our previous result [1]. The real-time dynamics of tunneling in thermal medium is studied in the standard model [4],[5], [6] of environment. Its interaction with a one dimensional system which we describe by a potential V (q) is of a bilinear form, q ∫ dω c(ω) Q(ω).

40|$|Aperture {{uncertainty}} {{is a key}} ADC concern when performing IF sampling. The terms aperture jitter and aperture uncertainty are synonymous and are frequently interchanged in the literature. Aperture {{uncertainty is}} the sample-to-sample variation in the encoding process. It has three distinct effects on system performance. First, it can increase system noise. Second, it {{can contribute to the}} uncertainty in the actual phase of the sampled signal itself giving rise to increases in error vector magnitude. Third, it can heighten intersymbol interference (ISI). However, in typical communications applications, an aperture uncertainty that is sufficiently small to meet system noise constraints results in negligible impact on phase uncertainty and ISI. For example, consider the case of sampling an IF of 250 MHz. At that speed, even 1 ps of aperture jitter can limit any ADC’s SNR to only 56 dB, while for the same conditions, the phase uncertainty error is only 0. 09 degrees rms based on a 4 ns period. This is quite acceptable even for a demanding specification such as GSM. The focus of this analysis is, therefore, on overall noise contribution due to aperture uncertainty. Figure 1 illustrates how an error in the sampling instant results in an error in the sampled voltage. Mathematically, the magnitude of the sampled voltage error is defined by the time derivative of the signal function. Consider a sine wave input signal v (t) Asin (2 π ft) The derivative is (t) <b>dv</b> <b>dt</b> = (1) (πft = A 2 πf cos 2) (2) The maximum error occurs when the cosine function equals 1, that is, at t = 0.

The decay constant depends {{on the type of}} beer and can be used to differentiate between different beers. The analysis shows in a transparent way the techniques of data analysis commonly used in science—consistency checks of theoretical models with the data, parameter estimation and determination of confidence intervals. Exponential laws are common to many physical phenomena. Examples are the amplitude of an oscillator subject to linear friction, the discharge of a capacitor, cooling processes or radioactive decays. The demonstration described here has the advantages that it is cheap, clear and motivating because it investigates an everyday phenomenon. It can easily be repeated by the students elsewhere. The decay of beer froth is mentioned as a very short notice in [1]. It is described in several German textbooks of mathematics. Recently, it also attracted the attention of Bavarian pupils [2]. The data analysis proposed in this paper has much in common with real science—see, for example, the determination of the Higgs mass by the LEP collaborations [3]. The techniques involved are of great practical importance but are often poorly understood by students [4]. Exponential decay can be demonstrated using beer froth, the volume of which reduces exponentially with time [1].

The interneurons and the remaining (1 − 2 f) NE pyramidal cells were non-selective {{to any of the}} motion stimuli. The inhibitory population acted not only to globally inhibit the excitatory cells, but also to inhibit itself. In addition to receiving inputs from all other cells (fully-connected network), each neuron also received Poisson distributed noisy excitatory inputs from neurons outside the local cortical module. Besides mimicking in vivo conditions, the external input provided a main source of noise to the local network. Moreover, the overall excitatory external input, together with feedback inhibition that dominates the recurrent circuit, results in a low spontaneous firing rate for the pyramidal cells (Amit and Brunel 1997). Neurons Single cells were represented by a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model.

40|$|Abstract. We {{deal with}} the viscous {{profiles}} for a class of mixed hyperbolicparabolic systems. We focus, in particular, {{on the case of}} the compressible Navier Stokes equation in one space variable written in Eulerian coordinates. We describe the link between these profiles and a singular ordinary differential equation in the form (1) <b>dV</b> <b>dt</b> 1 = F(V). ζ(V) Here V ∈ R d and the function F takes values into R d and is smooth. The real valued function ζ is as well regular: the equation is singular in the sense that ζ(V) can attain the value 0. We focus on mixed hyperbolic-parabolic systems in one space variable in the form (2) E(u) ut + A(u, ux) ux = B(u) uxx. Here the function u takes values in RN and depends on the two scalar variables t and x. We focus on the case the matrix B is singular, namely its rank is strictly smaller than N. In particular, a conservative system ut + f(u) x = B(u) ux can be written in the form (2). Indeed, one can set A(u, ux) = D f(u) − B(u) x, where D f denotes the jacobian matrix of f. In the following we will consider explicitly the case of the compressible Navier Stokes equation in one space variable: ρt + (ρv) ...|$|E
40|$|Cataract, {{a leading}} cause of blindness, is of special concern in diabetics as it occurs at earlier onset. Polyol {{accumulation}} and increased oxidative-nitrosative stress in cataractogenesis are associated with NFκB activation, iNOS expression, ATP depletion, loss of ATPase functions, calpain activation and proteolysis of soluble to insoluble proteins. Tocotrienol was previously shown to reduce lens oxidative stress and inhibit cataractogenesis in galactose-fed rats. In current study, we investigated anticataract effects of topical tocotrienol and possible mechanisms involved in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced in Sprague Dawley rats by intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Diabetic rats were treated with vehicle (<b>DV)</b> or tocotrienol (<b>DT).</b> A third group consists of normal, non-diabetic rats were treated with vehicle (NV). All treatments were given topically, bilaterally, twice daily for 8 weeks with weekly slit lamp monitoring. Subsequently, rats were euthanized and lenses were subjected to estimation of polyol accumulation, oxidative-nitrosative stress, NFκB activation, iNOS expression, ATP levels, ATPase activities, calpain activity and total protein levels. Cataract progression was delayed from the fifth week onwards in DT with lower mean of cataract stages compared to DV group (p< 0. 01) despite persistent hyperglycemia. Reduced cataractogenesis in DT group was accompanied with lower aldose reductase activity and sorbitol level compared to DV group (p< 0. 01). DT group also showed reduced NFκB activation, lower iNOS expression and reduced oxidative-nitrosative stress compared to DV group. Lenticular ATP and ATPase and calpain 2 activities in DT group were restored to normal. Consequently, soluble to insoluble protein ratio in DT group was higher compared to DV (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, preventive effect of topical tocotrienol on development of cataract in STZ-induced diabetic rats could be attributed to reduced lens aldose reductase activity, polyol levels and oxidative-nitrosative stress. These effects of tocotrienol invlove reduced NFκB activation, lower iNOS expression, restoration of ATP level, ATPase activities, calpain activity and lens protein levels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This note {{will prove}} a discreteness {{criterion}} {{for groups of}} orientation-preserving isometries of the hyperbolic space which contain a parabolic element. It {{can be viewed as}} a generalization of the well-known results of Shimizu-Leutbecher and Jørgensen in dimensions 2 and 3, and is closely related to Waterman’s inequality in higher dimensions. Unlike his algebraic method, the argument presented here is geometric and yields an improved asymptotic bound. 1. Preliminaries We will need a few basic facts about the hyperbolic space and its isometries, as well as the notion of the Margulis region associated with parabolic fixed points. Most of this material is standard and can be found, for example, in [2], [6], and [9]. Throughout we will use the upper half-space model for the n-dimensional real hyperbolic space: Hn = {x = (v, t) : v ∈ Rn− 1, t> 0 }. The extended boundary ∂Hn ∼ = Rn− 1 = Rn− 1 ∪ {∞} is homeomorphic to the sphere of dimension n − 1, with the closure Hn = Hn ∪ Rn− 1 homeomorphic to the closed n-ball. The hyperbolic metric (<b>dv</b> 2 + <b>dt</b> 2) /t 2 on Hn induces the distance ρ(·, ·) which satisfies (1) cosh(ρ(x, x̂)) = 1 + ‖x − x̂‖ 2 2 tt̂ (x, x ̂ ∈ Hn). Here ‖ · ‖ is the Euclidean norm in Rn and t, t ̂ are the heights of x, x̂. We denote by Isom+(Hn) the group of orientation-preserving isometries of Hn with respect to hyperbolic metric. Every element of Isom+(Hn) extends continuously to a Möbius map acting on Rn− 1. Conversely, the Poincare ́ extension of every Möbius map of Rn− 1 is an element of Isom+(Hn). It follows that Isom+(Hn) is canonically isomorphic to the group Möb(n − 1) of orientation-preserving Möbius maps acting on the (n − 1) -sphere. For each g ∈ Isom+(Hn), the fixed point set fix(g) = {x ∈ Hn: g(x) = x} is non-empty. A non-identity g is elliptic if fix(g) intersects Hn...|$|R
40|$|Newton's second {{law says}} that m d 2 q = F (q, v). dt 2 The {{constant}} m is {{the mass of the}} particle: it measures the amount of matter it contains. q(t) is the position on the particle as a function of time t. We only consider the case of a particle that can move along a line. For example, a railway compartment on a long track. F (q, v) is the force acting on the particle when it is at position q with velocity v = dq dt. We assume that the force has no direct dependence on time: the force for a given position and velocity is the same no matter what the time. The basic problem of mechanics is to nd the position as a function of time, given the initial position and velocity. q 0 = q(0), v 0 = v(0). 2 Free Particle The simplest case is when the force is zero. In this case the acceleration is zero. The velocity is a constant. The position is a linear function of time. q(t) = q 0 + v 0 t. 3 Constant Force If the force is a constant (independent of position and velocity) the acceleration is a constant as well. Then a = F m <b>dv</b> <b>dt</b> Then. the velocity is a linear function = a. 1 v(t) = v 0 + at. The position satis es so that dq dt = v 0 + at q(t) = q 0 + v 0 t + 1 2 at 2. The acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth is roughly independent of height (as long the height is a few kilometers or less). For all bodies this is about 9. 8 ms − 2. It is pointed downward. 4 The Simple Harmonic Oscillator The next case is when the force is proportional to distance from some xed point (the origin). It can either point away from the origin or towards the origin. We consider the case where it points to the origin always. F = −kq, k> 0. We have then dq dt = v <b>dv</b> <b>dt</b> k m q. This is called the Simple Harmonic Oscillator. It describes a particle that moves back and forth (oscillates) around the origin. To solve the equation remember the equations of calculus d sin θ dθ = cos θ So d cos θ dθ = − sin θ q = A sin[ωt + φ] 2 is a solution for any constants A and φif k ω = m. (Prove this!) The constants Aand φare determined by the initial conditions q 0 = A sin φ, v 0 = Aω cos φ. The position and velocity are periodic funtion. if q(t + T) = q(t) T = 2 π ω. (Prove this also.) You will see this example appear everywhere in physics: it is a most fundamental system...|$|E
