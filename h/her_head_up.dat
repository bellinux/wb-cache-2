500|$|Elisabeth Moss {{said she}} was not told by Weiner that Peggy would be leaving SCDP [...] "until we were {{shooting}} episode 10, the one right before it. It was unusual that he didn't tell me. He usually tells me what's happening, pitches me things to ask me how they sound." [...] Moss' initial reaction [...] "was just one of feeling like {{there was really no}} other logical way to go for her. After everything that had happened for five years, she can't just keep butting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> against that wall. [...] She's becoming her own person and she needs to have her own place not under Don." [...] Moss also said, [...] "I will thank [...] forever for not telling me. It would have made my life harder. I knew about Peggy's baby in season one. I fought against it, to play it as she was living it, feeling it, and not be in my head. Not knowing Peggy would quit allowed me to find it for myself, to really feel Peggy's growing frustration with Don all season." ...|$|E
500|$|Another serious {{explosion}} {{occurred at}} 14:42 that started severe {{fires in the}} hangar and blew the forward elevator [...] above the flight deck. Power to the forward half of the ship failed shortly afterward. Fletcher sent three destroyers to assist, but another major explosion at 15:25 knocked out water pressure in the hangar and forced the evacuation of the forward machinery spaces. The fire eventually forced the evacuation of all compartments below the waterline at 16:00 and Lexington eventually drifted to a halt. Evacuation of the wounded began shortly afterward and Sherman ordered [...] "abandon ship" [...] at 17:07. A series of large explosions began around 18:00 that blew the aft elevator apart and threw aircraft into the air. Sherman waited until 18:30 {{to ensure that all}} of his crewmen were off the ship before leaving himself. Some 2,770 officers and men were rescued {{by the rest of the}} task force. The destroyer [...] was ordered to sink the ship and fired a total of five torpedoes between 19:15 and 19:52. Immediately after the last torpedo hit, Lexington, down by the bow but nearly on an even keel finally sank at [...] A Lexington officer famously said [...] "There she goes. [...] She didn't turn over. [...] She's going down with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>up.</b> [...] Dear old Lex...a lady to the last." [...] Some 216 crewmen were killed and 2,735 were evacuated.|$|E

2500|$|Christopher Bowdish, a Bethlehem Police detective, stated that, {{as medical}} {{personnel}} attended to Joan Porco at her home, {{he took a}} moment to ask her whether she could identify her attacker. Bowdish said that when he asked Joan if a family member had done it, Joan used her head to indicate [...] "yes". Bowdish has maintained that when he asked her whether it had been her older son Jonathan, a Naval officer stationed in South Carolina during the attack, she shook her head, indicating it was not, but that she nodded <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> and down, indicating [...] "yes", when he asked her whether Christopher was responsible. Joan Porco's alleged identification of her son Christopher may explain why Bethlehem Police pursued her son soon after the incident, rather than conducting a broader investigation of potential suspects. She also answered in similar ways to other separate questions.|$|E
2500|$|A 1934 New Yorker article {{reported}} that at her execution she wore [...] "a neat Amazonian tailored suit, especially {{made for the}} occasion, {{and a pair of}} new white gloves" [...] though another account indicates she wore the same suit, low-cut blouse and tricorn hat ensemble which had been picked out by her accusers for her to wear at trial, and which was still the only full, clean outfit which she had in prison. Neither description matches photographic evidence. Wales recorded her death, saying that after the volley of shots rang out, [...] "Slowly, inertly, she settled to her knees, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>up</b> always, and without the slightest change of expression on her face. For the fraction of a second it seemed she tottered there, on her knees, gazing directly at those who had taken her life. Then she fell backward, bending at the waist, with her legs doubled up beneath her." [...] A non-commissioned officer then walked up to her body, pulled out his revolver, and shot her in the head to make sure she was dead.|$|E
2500|$|The album's artwork {{was shot}} by Mert and Marcus and {{directed}} by Giovanni Bianco. The deluxe edition was unveiled through Madonna's official Facebook page on January 31, 2012. Jocelyn Vena of MTV News described the image as [...] "glamorous, deconstructed photograph" [...] where Madonna [...] "cocks <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>up,</b> her curly hair pulled back. She's wearing lots of mascara, bright red lipstick, a choker and a silky bright pink top. The photo {{has some kind of}} broken mirror filter over it, giving it a funky, dance-queen vibe." [...] Robbie Daw of Idolator compared the [...] "multi-hued" [...] artwork to the one of True Blue (1986), with the similarity in Madonna's blond locks and the tilting of her head. He further added that the artwork symbolized the different angles through which the singer has been scrutinized throughout her career. The standard edition cover was revealed on February 6, 2012. Its art direction included the same color palette and the distorted appearance like the deluxe version image, but featured a body-shot of Madonna in a red dress and gloves with jewelry.|$|E
