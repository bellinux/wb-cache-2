40|$|Policy makers, {{industry}} and researchers are paying considerable {{attention to the}} importance of the relationship between <b>food</b> and <b>tourism</b> in destination differentiation from competitors and in contributing to economic development. There is a vital role for food in broadening a destination’s appeal; increasing visitor yield; enhancing visitor experience; strengthening regional identity; and stimulating growth in other sectors. Thus, food contributes to the overall sustainable competitiveness of a tourism destination. Despite growing research interest in <b>food</b> and <b>tourism,</b> there is still work to be done to bring the relationship of these two elements into focus. In order to better understand the role that <b>food</b> plays in <b>tourism</b> destination differentiation and development this PhD research draws on globalisation theory, world culture theory, tourism development theory and network and cluster theory. Particular attention is paid to the role that global processes play in shaping regional competitiveness and resultant policy initiatives. The empirical focus of the research is on the case of Rotorua, New Zealand, located in the Bay of Plenty in the central North Island. Rotorua is one of the premier tourist destinations in New Zealand, however, on a range of socio-economic indicators it ranks poorly compared with other regions in the country. The region is rich in scenic resources and Maori cultural heritage and these are the main attractions of the district. With the exception of the traditional Maori hangi, the contribution of <b>food</b> in <b>tourism</b> has not been emphasized strongly by regional food/tourism stakeholders. This study argues that greater use of local food in the region’s tourism offers a means of potentially strengthening the district’s development and differentiation. A thorough content analysis of national and regional tourism organisation marketing on the Internet and in brochures reveals that food features prominently in the 100 % Pure New Zealand Internet campaign and in a number of regional tourism promotions. Rotorua is shown to lag behind many regions in its use of food as a feature of the local tourism experience. Interviews with 50 <b>tourism</b> and <b>food</b> industry experts provide a range of insights into the issues associated with attempting to increase the role of <b>food</b> in <b>tourism</b> in Rotorua, and in New Zealand more generally. A variety of issues and constraints which work against developing the role of <b>food</b> in <b>tourism</b> are identified. The research highlights that there is {{little in the way of}} an identifiable regional cuisine in Rotorua. There is also lack of communication between local <b>food</b> and <b>tourism</b> stakeholders and an absence of effective networks. A variety of suggestions are then presented on ways to more effectively link <b>food</b> to <b>tourism</b> in Rotorua. The research highlights the importance of developing regional food network groups and the linking of <b>food</b> into local <b>tourism</b> strategies. The potential to better develop indigenous dimensions of <b>food</b> in <b>tourism</b> is also examined. Not every region can market themselves as ‘food tourism’ destinations but most have some potential to increase the role that local <b>food</b> plays in <b>tourism</b> and development. The Rotorua case shows that there is potential to use food as a tool to achieve destination differentiation and development in regions whose success and renown is based on attractions other than food...|$|R

50|$|The most {{frequent}} misunderstanding or misconception among professionals in our industry is that agritourism and <b>food</b> <b>tourism</b> are interchangeable terms. Nothing {{could be further}} from the truth. Agritourism is a subset of rural tourism, and involves farms, farm activities, and can include farmers' markets. As an activity, agritourism tends to be popular with locals and close-in regional travelers, but it tends to be less attractive to visitors from across countries or across the world. Very few visitors will pay money to ride a cow or purchase a bunch of rhubarb to take back to their hotel room. Farm tours generally are a more popular activity with children, which is another reason farm visitors tend to be more local and regional (because it is much more expensive to transport a family with children by air than it is by car). Recently, some visitors have expressed interest in food pedigree (sourcing), composting and animal welfare. These are more food industry issues and have less to do with tourism, although some travelers take their behavior and values with them while traveling. The bottom line is that agriculture has a very limited appeal to long haul visitors, and therefore has limited economic potential. The <b>food</b> <b>tourism</b> industry, and our Association, respect agriculture, and farmers, and acknowledges that the seeds of cuisine are in agriculture. Rather than focusing on agritourism, a more profitable potential for the agriculture industry is in value-added agricultural products. Look at our wheel of economic development which illustrates how agriculture, agritourism and <b>food</b> <b>tourism</b> (in other words, our entire community) interrelate.|$|E

Culinary/food tourism is not limited to gourmet food.|$|E
