While kabuki is technically theater and not <b>dance,</b> <b>the</b> movements, for example, of the sword-fighting termed tachimawari in kabuki are gymnastic to the point even of employing somersaults, and elaborate fight scenes are so deliberate and stylized that they provide at least an area of overlap between theater and dance.|$|E

His final completed work, Our Song (1883), is the last of four settings of texts by Josef Srb-Debrnov. Despite the state of Smetana's health, this is a happy celebration of Czech song and <b>dance.</b> <b>The</b> piece was lost for many years, and only received its first performance after rediscovery in 1924.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Shiva's wife Sati immolated {{herself in}} the yajna-fire of her father Daksha, as a protest against Shiva's dishonor. The God became furious and started to <b>dance</b> <b>the</b> Tāndava with Sati's body on his shoulders. Knowing that the dance of {{destruction}} was about to annihilate the world, Vishnu cut the body of Sati to pieces with Sudarshana Chakram, his celestial weapon, thereby appeasing Shiva. Each of 51 pieces of the body fell to earth, and the place where each piece fell became a holy center of pilgrimage or Shakti Peetha. The legend goes that Sati's right arm fell near a now-extinct hot spring at the Chandranth peak in Sitakunda. The site is marked by the temple of Sambhunath just below the Chandranath temple {{on top of the}} peak, and it is a major tirtha for Hindus in Bangladesh.|$|E

5|$|Coinciding {{with this}} {{cultural}} reemergence was {{the establishment of}} the Istanbul Festival, which began showcasing a variety of art from Turkey and around the world in 1973. From this flagship festival came the International Istanbul Film Festival and the Istanbul International Jazz Festival in the early 1980s. With its focus now solely on music and <b>dance,</b> <b>the</b> Istanbul Festival has been known as the Istanbul International Music Festival since 1994. The most prominent of the festivals that evolved from the original Istanbul Festival is the Istanbul Biennial, held every two years since 1987. Its early incarnations were aimed at showcasing Turkish visual art, and it has since opened to international artists and risen in prestige to join the elite biennales, alongside the Venice Biennale and the São Paulo Art Biennial.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{favorable}} {{reviews of}} her performances in The Big Knife and Peter Pan, her worsening {{health and the}} failure of her most recent Broadway plays took a toll on her career. As her health declined, she found that her dancing ability was affected. She suffered a severe heart attack in 1955, followed by a possible second attack, and then developed pneumonia which required an extended stay in the hospital. She hid the severity of her health problems, but some details became public. Upon release from the hospital, McCracken was told by her doctors that she could no longer <b>dance.</b> <b>The</b> news was devastating to her.|$|E
5|$|In the song's music video, Trainor sings into a red {{microphone}} {{in front of}} a pastel blue wall. She is sometimes flanked by backup dancers and television screens. Lips are used as a motif throughout the video; they appear as closeups of Trainor's mouth and as a large drawing of lips used as a backdrop. Yahoo! Music writer Lyndsey Parker compared the video to the poster for The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Trainor wears lip-shaped earrings and sunglasses in the video, and is seen reclining on a lip-shaped sofa. Parker compared the sofa in the video to the sofas used in the American television program So You Think You Can <b>Dance.</b> <b>The</b> video's set changes constantly; props are lifted on-and-off screen by workers throughout the clip.|$|E

5|$|Louise's father, Prince Albert, died at Windsor on 14 December 1861. The Queen was devastated, {{and ordered}} her {{household}} {{to move from}} Windsor to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The atmosphere of the royal court became gloomy and morbid {{in the wake of}} the Prince's death, and entertainments became dry and dull. Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother's prolonged mourning. For her seventeenth birthday in 1865, Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a debutante <b>dance,</b> <b>the</b> like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert's death. Her request was refused, and her boredom with the mundane routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother, who considered Louise to be indiscreet and argumentative.|$|E

Pritzker Pavilion is built partially atop the Harris Theater for Music and <b>Dance,</b> <b>the</b> park's indoor performing arts venue, with which it shares a loading dock and backstage facilities. Initially the pavilion's lawn seats were free for all concerts, but this changed when Tori Amos performed the first rock concert there on August 31, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Sercey retired {{with his}} frigates to Île de France, {{where he learned}} to his horror of the {{opportunity}} he had missed in the Bali Strait. His squadron required extensive repairs, but the Colonial Committee on Île de France remained rebellious over attempts to abolish slavery and denied his ships men and food supplies. Eventually Sercey was forced to disband his squadron, sending four frigates back to France. Seven years after the Bali Strait Incident, in 1804, early in the Napoleonic Wars, another strong French naval squadron encountered a much larger China Fleet at the Battle of Pulo Aura. As in 1797, Nathaniel <b>Dance,</b> <b>the</b> EIC Commodore, managed to bluff the French admiral into believing there were warships among his convoy and the French retired after a brief exchange of gunfire.|$|E
