Part of that plan was the construction of Udell Lookout Tower. Soon after a residence and garage were constructed near the tower; these buildings were moved about ten years later. Udell Tower remained a primary fire lookout tower until the 1960s, when aerial observation flights became more common. Many other lookout towers were abandoned at the same time, and were eventually destroyed or demolished. The Udell Lookout Tower is the last standing example {{of this type of}} tower in the Huron-Manistee National Forests.|$|E

After the new Planning and Building Act code into force in 2011, the responsibility lie on the developer to ensure laws and regulations. Based on the regulatory framework that is available occurs sometimes balance issues, between care requirements and building codes.   The station building in Ormaryd was acquired in 2009 by two individuals who intended to accommodate office and retail space in the building. In doing so a new local plan of the area was established, including regulations on how the building could be used. By including road safety and noise, the risk was not considered appropriate to use the station building for housing. The new local plan classed the building with a “capital Q”, which meant that the building's cultural value shall be cared for. From an architectural documentation was an enriching story told that could clarify the many values of the building and its surrounding environment. The building is still an important symbol of the district, although it is no longer used for railway operations.   The long process that was followed by the change of use of the station featured everything from planning application, for consultation and preparation of documentation and <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> <b>plan.</b> It proved to be a complicated way, which largely came to touch on issues concerning accessibility, fire and ventilation. The owners themselves have been very interested in preserving the existing building and seen its values, therefore Ormaryd’s station may be altered in a gentle way, although results have not yet seen the light of day. It is proven that careful restorations can meet building codes, which this thesis will demonstrates. It will not only show the presumed change, it will also show other options. To avoid entirely the loss of cultural values when adapting a building is almost impossible but interventions can be minimized and additions made reversible...|$|E

500|$|Three {{years later}} (1937), the various Navy bureaus held a joint {{meeting to discuss}} a {{possible}} partial modernization of the Tennessees and Colorados.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the aim of evaluating the fire reports occurring in the Itatiaia National Park (INP) between 1937 and 2008 and aiming to show information about the total number of fires occurred, and the annual burnt areas, in relation with climate and biodiversity, the months of highest occurrence, the origins and causes of fires. A survey of 323 reports of forest fires showed the highest incidence of forest fires in the months of winter, during the dry season, between July and October. The most affected vegetation was that of the "campos de altitude" (high-altitude grasslands), a native ecosystem of Atlantic Rainforest restricted to the isolated southeastern high peaks and plateaus. Most of the fires had unknown origins and causes, and only twice were examinations by experts carried out.

5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} the chances of out of <b>control</b> <b>fires</b> and threats to people and structures, park employees {{do more than just}} monitor the potential for <b>fire.</b> <b>Controlled</b> burns are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of high fire danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it {{was an integral part of}} the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to <b>control.</b> <b>Fire</b> Management <b>Plans</b> were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.|$|R

40|$|A web-based Decision Support System, named FLIRE DSS, for {{combined}} forest <b>fire</b> <b>control</b> and <b>planning</b> {{as well as}} flood risk management, {{has been}} developed and is presented in this paper. State of the art tools and models {{have been used in}} order to enable Civil Protection agencies and local stakeholders {{to take advantage of the}} web based DSS without the need of local installation of complex software and their maintenance. Civil protection agencies can predict the behavior of a fire event using real time data and in such a way plan its efficient elimination. Also, during dry periods, agencies can implement “what-if” scenarios for areas that are prone to fire and thus have available plans for forest fire management in case such scenarios occur. Flood services include flood maps and flood-related warnings and become available to relevant authorities for visualization and further analysis on a daily basis. When flood warnings are issued, relevant authorities may proceed to efficient evacuation planning for the areas that are likely to flood and thus save human lives. Real-time weather data from ground stations provide the necessary inputs for the calculation of the fire model in real-time, and a high resolution weather forecast grid supports flood modeling as well as the development of “what-if” scenarios for the fire modeling. All these can be accessed by various computer sources including PC, laptop, Smartphone and tablet either by normal network connection or by using 3 G and 4 G cellular network. The latter is important for the accessibility of the FLIRE DSS during firefighting or rescue operations during flood events. All these methods and tools provide the end users with the necessary information to design an operational plan for the elimination of the fire events and the efficient management of the flood events in almost real time. Concluding, the FLIRE DSS can be easily transferred to other areas with similar characteristics due to its robust architecture and its flexibility...|$|R
