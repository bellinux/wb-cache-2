5|$|Following this action, Frederick sent Wunsch into Saxony with a {{corps of}} 10,00012,000 men {{in his first}} {{independent}} command.

5|$|The Hardys {{would then}} face The Tribunal one week later, on October 20's {{broadcast}} {{where they were}} able to successfully defend their titles. However, after the match as they returned to the dressing-rooms, the arena went dark, signalling the arrival of a new faction, dubbed the DCC. The DCC would use the darkness to attack and layout The Tribunal as The Hardys looked on from the ramp, thus potentially building an upcoming rivalry <b>in</b> <b>weeks</b> to comes. On February 27, 2017, The Hardys announced their departure from TNA after negotiations of a new contract fell through. Jeff and Matt left the company without dropping the TNA World Tag Team Championships.|$|E
5|$|Davis was not re-signed by the Eagles {{following}} the 1995 season {{and became an}} unrestricted free agent. He worked out for the Atlanta Falcons on April 25, 1996.

He began the 1996 season as a backup behind David Richards at right tackle. Davis started in place of the injured Richards for a week five game against the San Francisco 49ers on September 29. Richards came back from his injury in week six, but he and Davis split playing time <b>in</b> <b>weeks</b> seven and eight against the Houston Oilers and Dallas Cowboys, respectively. Richards was waived on October 23 by the Falcons, who decided to go with Davis at right tackle {{for the remainder of the}} year.

5|$|Punk cited {{his health}} {{as the main}} reason he left WWE, {{describing}} that in his final months in the company, {{he had been working}} through an untreated and potentially fatal MRSA infection, broken ribs, injured knees, and multiple concussions including one at the Royal Rumble, as well as having lost his appetite and ability to sleep well. Punk felt that WWE was pressuring and rushing him to wrestle before he had fully recovered. According to him, he found a lump on his back in November 2013 and it was diagnosed as a fatty deposit by Dr. Chris Amann, who refused to remove it despite Punk's requests. The week after Punk left WWE, his wife April Mendez convinced him to get the lump checked by her doctor. The doctor diagnosed it as a MRSA infection and told Punk that he could have died due to ignoring it for such a long time. Punk had the doctor evacuate the infection, describing it as the worst pain in his life, but said that once it was treated and he was on stronger medication, he was able to sleep better than he had <b>in</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{started the}} regular season by winning their first three games before losing <b>in</b> <b>weeks</b> four and five to the Detroit Lions and New Orleans Saints, respectively. The {{following}} game after winning against the New York Giants, quarterback Jay Cutler suffered a groin injury against the Washington Redskins, as the Bears entered the bye week at 4–3. With Cutler out, Josh McCown stepped in against the Green Bay Packers in week nine, leading the Bears to victory. Cutler returned in the next game against the Lions, but injured his ankle in the loss, and McCown filled in {{for the next four}} games; during the four-game span under McCown, the Bears went 2–2, while McCown excelled, throwing thirteen touchdowns and one interception. As a result, when Cutler returned in week fourteen against the Cleveland Browns, controversy arose over who should be the starter. After winning against Cleveland, the Lions lost the following day, allowing the Bears to clinch the NFC North in week sixteen with Packers and Lions losses grouped with a victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. However, the Bears lost 54–11, and in week seventeen against the Packers, the Bears were eliminated from playoff contention with a 33–28 loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} {{compartments}} that store lead are the blood, soft tissues, and bone; the half-life {{of lead in}} these tissues is measured <b>in</b> <b>weeks</b> for blood, months for soft tissues, and years for bone. Lead in the bones, teeth, hair, and nails is bound tightly and not available to other tissues, and is generally thought not to be harmful. In adults, 94% of absorbed lead is deposited in the bones and teeth, but children only store 70% in this manner, a fact which may partially account for the more serious health effects on children. The estimated half-life of lead in bone is 20 to 30years, and bone can introduce lead into the bloodstream long after the initial exposure is gone. The half-life of lead in the blood in men is about 40days, {{but it may be}} longer in children and pregnant women, whose bones are undergoing remodeling, which allows the lead to be continuously re-introduced into the bloodstream. Also, if lead exposure takes place over years, clearance is much slower, partly due to the re-release of lead from bone. Many other tissues store lead, but those with the highest concentrations (other than blood, bone, and teeth) are the brain, spleen, kidneys, liver, and lungs.|$|E
