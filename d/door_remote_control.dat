50|$|The {{third stage}} of garage door opener market uses a {{frequency}} spectrum range between 300-400 MHz {{and most of}} the transmitter/receivers rely on hopping or rolling code technology. This approach prevents criminals from recording a code and replaying it to open a garage door. Since the signal is supposed to be significantly different from that of any other garage <b>door</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control,</b> manufacturers claim it is impossible for someone other than the owner of the remote to open the garage. When the transmitter sends a code, it generates a new code using an encoder. The receiver, after receiving a correct code, uses the same encoder with the same original seed to generate a new code that it will accept in the future. Because there is a high probability that someone might accidentally push the open button while not in range and desynchronize the code, the receiver generates look-a-head codes ahead of time. Rolling code is the same method of security used on the clickers of cars, and with some internet protocols for secure sites.|$|E
40|$|If RF {{testing is}} in your future, you’ll need a {{spectrum}} analyzer. But they don’t come cheap. Your {{best bet is to}} follow Neal’s lead by building your own 4 ″ × 4 ″ system. It is funny how simple beginnings can lead you down convoluted paths of learning and discovery. About {{a year and a half}} ago, I was playing around with my automatic garage <b>door</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> unit. I was experimenting with signal encoding at the time, and I wanted to look at the scheme used in my remote. One thing led to another, and before I knew it, I was trying to determine the RF frequency at which the transmitter was operating. I then built RF filters to look at signal levels and RF generators to aid in prototyping and testing. Next came RF mixing, frequency doubling, and so on. You can see where I’m going here. I became hooked on RF and all of the art that goes along with getting RF circuits working properly. Currently, all of my design-related pursuits are focused on circuits and test equipment at radio frequencies. When it comes to RF test equipment, the spectrum analyzer is the Holy Grail. Unfortunately, both new and used RF spectrum analyzers are extremely expensive. There are a variety of home-brew spectrum analyzers available on the ’Net. Some are more sophisticated than others because all of the circuit elements are built from scratch. They feature complex filter constructions, have precise PCB layouts that turn PCB traces into inductors, and include a lot of discrete components. Other somewhat simpler designs feature integrated modules borrowed from the TV/VCR tuner world. These are easier to build, but they lack sophistication and functionality. As I was browsing the ’Net for an alternative to a home-brew spectrum analyzer, I stumbled across the Maxim MAX 3550, which seemed almost too good to be true. Not onl...|$|E

50|$|The first garage <b>door</b> opener <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> {{were simple}} and {{consisted}} of a simple transmitter (the remote) and receiver which controlled the opener mechanism. The transmitter would transmit on a designated frequency; the receiver would listen for the radio signal, then open or close the garage, depending on the door position. The basic concept {{of this can be}} traced back to World War II. This type of system was used to detonate remote bombs. While novel at the time, the technology ran its course when garage door openers became widely available and used. Then, not only did a person open their garage door, they opened their neighbor’s garage door as well. While the garage <b>door</b> <b>remote</b> is low in power and in range, it was powerful enough to interfere with other receivers in the area.|$|R

5000|$|SAW {{resonators}} {{are used}} {{in many of the}} same applications in which quartz crystals are used, because they can operate at higher frequency. [...] They are often used in radio transmitters where tunability is not required. They are often used in applications such as garage <b>door</b> opener <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> short range radio frequency links for computer peripherals, and other devices where channelization is not required. Where a radio link might use several channels, quartz crystal oscillators are more commonly used to drive a phase locked loop. Since the resonant frequency of a SAW device is set by the mechanical properties of the crystal, it does not drift as much as a simple LC oscillator, where conditions such as capacitor performance and battery voltage will vary substantially with temperature and age.|$|R

In Thailand, spectrum management has developed in several phases, from the establishment of an authority without a radiocommunication act to the implementation of that act, the establishment of the national frequency management board, and the establishment of an independent regulator. This paper provides a chronological account of how the spectrum assignment, especially spectrum commons, developed in Thailand. Access to the archive of the post and telegraph department, Thailand, including the minutes of the national frequency management board, and interviewing the relevant persons have provided the rationale for spectrum assignment, how it has been developed and why this concept is essential for the regulator and society...|$|R
