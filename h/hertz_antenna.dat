40|$|It may be {{possible}} to construct a laser interferometer gravitational wave antenna in space with h_rms∼ 10 ^- 23 at f∼ 0. 1 Hz in ∼ 2020. This deci <b>hertz</b> <b>antenna</b> may be called DECIGO/BBO,which stand for DECi hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory and Big Bang Observer, respectively. The analysis of 1 - 10 years observational data of the coalescing binary neutron stars or black holes at the distance of ∼ 300 Mpc will give us the spatial position within ∼ an arc minute and the time of the coalescence within ∼ 0. 1 sec beforehand. With the knowledge of the accurate position and the time of final merging event, the follow up simultaneous observation using high frequency (f∼ 100 Hz) gravitational wave antennae as well as electro-magnetic wave antennae from the radio frequency to the ultra high energy gamma ray will reveal the physics in the enigmatic event of the coalescence and the formation of the black hole.

5000|$|In a {{long series}} of {{experiments}} Marconi found that by using an elevated wire monopole <b>antenna</b> instead of <b>Hertz's</b> dipole <b>antennas</b> he could transmit longer distances, beyond the curve of the Earth, demonstrating that radio was not just a laboratory curiosity but a commercially viable communication method. This culminated in his historic transatlantic wireless transmission on December 12, 1901 from Poldhu, Cornwall to St. John's, Newfoundland, a distance of 3500 km (2200 miles), which was received by a coherer. [...] However the usual range of coherer receivers even with the powerful transmitters of this era was limited to a few hundred miles.|$|R
50|$|The first antennas {{were built}} in 1888 by German {{physicist}} Heinrich Hertz in his pioneering experiments to prove the existence of electromagnetic waves predicted by the theory of James Clerk Maxwell. <b>Hertz</b> placed dipole <b>antennas</b> at {{the focal point of}} parabolic reflectors for both transmitting and receiving.

50|$|Hertz {{used the}} damped {{oscillating}} currents in a dipole antenna, {{triggered by a}} high-voltage electrical capacitive spark discharge, as his source of radio waves. His detector in some experiments was another dipole antenna connected to a narrow spark gap, thereby creating a spark-gap transmitter. A small spark in this gap signified detection of the radio waves. When he added cylindrical reflectors behind his dipole <b>antennas,</b> <b>Hertz</b> could detect radio waves about 20 m from the transmitter in his laboratory at the Karlsruhe Technical High School. He {{did not try to}} transmit further because his aim was proving electromagnetic theory, not developing wireless communication.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the first}} radio link {{was built by}} <b>Hertz</b> in 1886, <b>antennas</b> have become a {{critical}} technology which allows people to stay connected and informed. Several advances {{have been made in}} the field of antenna theory and technology in the past hundred twenty years. Among them is the characterization of frequency selective surfaces (FSS), which are periodic arrays of passive elements or slots that act as a band stop or a band pass filters respectively to propagating electromagnetic waves. The purpose of this project was to construct an antenna which is transmissive outside of the band of operation. For example, the antenna designed in this project operates in a band of 1 - 2 GHz. The goal of this project is to be able to place an antenna operating at 4 - 8 GHz behind this antenna and have it be able to “look though” the first antenna as if it wasn’t there. This will allow the user to stack antennas one behind the other and thus increase the density of antennas in a given area. This is advantageous in applications where the available real estate upon which to place antennas is limited, such as on ships and submarines. This antenna has two main components - an array of radiating elements and a reflector. The radiating array will be transmissive at 4 - 8 GHz as long as it does not radiate energy at this frequency and does not significantly scatter energy. These constraints are easily met by creating an array of wire elements. Reflectors, on the other hand, are commonly composed of a solid metal plate, which will reflect energy at any frequency. However, this project uses an element FSS for a reflector. As a result this reflector will only reflect energy in the stop band. Sufficiently outside of this band, it will be transmissive. While an entire antenna was designed for sake of completeness, the focus of this project was the design and testing of the FSS reflector. There were two main components to this project. The first was to use computational codes to design the antenna. Specifically, the antenna was designed using a Method of Moments (MoM) code, which calculates gain patterns for finite antennas. These results were then compared to a periodic moment method code, which calculates the ideal result for an infinite structure. This design process was completed in several steps. First the FSS array was designed to be reflective in the L band (1 - 2 GHz) and transmissive outside of this band. Following this the radiating array was designed to realize sufficiently flat L band bandwidth. The FSS reflector and radiating array were then combined together and the gain and transmissivity were then calculated for the entire antenna. Finally a prototype of the FSS reflector was built and tested. Time constraints prevented the construction of the entire antenna. The results of these tests are in very good agreement with each other. MoM tests show the FSS is within 1 dB of perfect reflectivity over the entire L band range. The prototype was within 2 dB of perfect reflectivity over the same range. This deviation is explained by unavoidable human error in the construction of the FSS. The periodic moment method code is also computed similar results. The bandwidth wasn’t quite as large in the PMM test, but this is expected and is explained by the fact that edge diffraction on finite structures increases the bandwidth. The transmissivity of this FSS is within 2 dB of perfect transmissivity in the C band (4 - 8 GHz.) Finally the gain of the radiating array has a 2 dB variation over L band, and the gain of the entire antenna has a 3 dB variation over L band...|$|R
