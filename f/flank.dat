40|$|The intronic {{sequences}} <b>flanking</b> exon–intron junctions (i. e., exon <b>flanks)</b> {{are important}} for splice site recognition and pre-mRNA splicing. Recent studies show {{a higher degree of}} sequence conservation at <b>flanks</b> of alternative exons, compared to <b>flanks</b> of constitutive exons. In this article we performed a detailed analysis on the evolutionary divergence of exon <b>flanks</b> between human and chimpanzee, aiming to dissect the impact of mutability and selection on their evolution. Inside exon <b>flanks,</b> sites that might reside in ancestral CpG dinucleotides evolved significantly faster than sites outside of ancestral CpG dinucleotides. This result reflects a systematic variation of mutation rates (mutability) at exon <b>flanks,</b> depending on the local CpG contexts. Remarkably, we observed a significant reduction of the nucleotide substitution rate in <b>flanks</b> of alternatively spliced exons, independent of the site-by-site variation in mutability due to different CpG contexts. Our data provide concrete evidence for increased purifying selection at exon <b>flanks</b> associated with regulation of alternative splicing...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{assessed}} {{the performance of}} a patient with right neglect (M. A. H.) across various manipulations of the <b>flanker</b> paradigm. When required to identify a central target {{in the presence of a}} unilateral <b>flanker,</b> M. A. H. responded to the <b>flanking</b> distractor on the left (ipsilesional) side as if it were the target, even when the <b>flanker</b> appeared at left peripheral locations. A right (contralesional) <b>flanker</b> did not affect central identification performance (Experiment 1). The "ipsilesional capture" effect persisted when pretrial location markers were introduced to make the <b>flanker</b> and target locations more clearly defined (Experiment 2). However, when the ipsilesional <b>flanker</b> appeared simultaneously with a contralesional <b>flanker,</b> central target detection improved to ceiling (Experiment 3). Interestingly, with these three-stimulus displays, congruency effects in reaction time only occurred in relation to the <b>flanker</b> on the contralesional side (Experiment 3), suggesting impaired response selectivity to ipsilesional stimuli. Congruency effects were produced on both sides only when the two <b>flanking</b> distractors grouped together (by both onset and offset, Experiment 4) and when the ipsilesional <b>flanking</b> distractor grouped with the target by onset (lone contra offset, Experiment 4). The results are attributed to ipsilesional capture in central target detection, which is offset by temporal grouping processes when another stimulus appears on the contralateral side...|$|R

5|$|All {{attempts}} {{to land on}} the southern side of the Meuse failed. Fortunately for Guderian, the 1st Panzer Division succeeded in crossing the Meuse in the centre (see above). Once completed, it headed into the right (eastern) <b>flank</b> of the French at Donchery. Some of its units cleared the Meuse bend. Assault Engineers and 1st Panzer Division neutralised the guns at Bellevue Castle, and cleared the bunker positions along the Meuse River from the rear. The artillery falling on the 2nd Panzer Division's eastern <b>flank</b> was stopped. With the threat of artillery fire on its right <b>flank</b> removed, the units on the 2nd Panzer's left <b>flank</b> crossed the river and infiltrated the French positions opposite Donchery at 20:00.

40|$|Word {{reading speed}} in {{peripheral}} vision is slower when words are {{in close proximity}} of other words (Chung, 2004). This word crowding effect could arise {{as a consequence of}} interaction of low-level letter features between words, or the interaction between high-level holistic representations of words. We evaluated these two hypotheses by examining how word crowding changes for five configurations of <b>flanking</b> words: the control condition - <b>flanking</b> words were oriented upright; scrambled - letters in each <b>flanking</b> word were scrambled in order; horizontal-flip - each <b>flanking</b> word was the left-right mirror-image of the original; letter-flip - each letter of the <b>flanking</b> word was the left-right mirror-image of the original; and vertical-flip - each <b>flanking</b> word was the up-down mirror-image of the original. The low-level letter feature interaction hypothesis predicts similar word crowding effect for all the different <b>flanker</b> configurations, while the high-level holistic representation hypothesis predicts less word crowding effect for all the alternative <b>flanker</b> conditions, compared with the control condition. We found that oral reading speed for words <b>flanked</b> above and below by other words, measured at 10 ° eccentricity in the nasal field, showed the same dependence on the vertical separation between the target and its <b>flanking</b> words, for the various <b>flanker</b> configurations. The result was also similar when we rotated the <b>flanking</b> words by 90 ° to disrupt the periodic vertical pattern, which presumably is the main structure in words. The remarkably similar word crowding effect irrespective of the <b>flanker</b> configurations suggests that word crowding arises as a consequence of interactions of low-level letter features. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>flanking</b> targets can impair depth discrimination, presumably through {{a form of}} lateral interaction or visual crowding. This study investigates how stereoscopic crowding interferes with foveal depth discrimination when tests and <b>flanking</b> stimuli of different spatial configuration are located {{on and off the}} horopter in normal subjects by using psychophysical means. The magnitude of crowding increased when the <b>flanking</b> bars were in close spatial proximity to the test, between 1 to 2 arc min, and returned to unflanked levels for wider separations of 4 arc min and beyond. The magnitude of crowding depended {{on the extent to which}} the test and the <b>flanking</b> bars width matched. When flankers were placed at the optimum crowding distance (OCD) and displaced off the horopter, crowding reduced but the <b>flanker</b> effect was restored at greater <b>flanker</b> disparity. On the contrary, flankers positioned at the least crowding distance (LCD) at the onset generally showed an increase in thresholds from the fixation plane with increasing <b>flanker</b> disparity. Crowding was produced at similar small test- <b>flanker</b> separation for the range of 0. 5 to 4 cpd <b>flanker</b> spatial frequency composition used. The magnitude of crowding was greater for test and <b>flanker</b> of similar spatial frequency, though some crowding was produced when their spatial frequency differed. Overall, the results confirm previous reports showing that depth discrimination thresholds increase in the {{presence of}} <b>flanking</b> contours, but in addition suggest that disparity integration relative to the fixation demonstrates a dichotomy of fine and coarse mechanisms driven by salience attraction. Additionally, the results show that the crowding effect can be reduced by depth cues related to the width, and disparity of <b>flanking</b> stimuli. The crowding effect may be attributed to the action of local disparity interactions, but suggest the involvement of Gestalt factors (for larger <b>flanker</b> widths) and luminance flux (for thinner <b>flanker</b> widths) factors...|$|R

40|$|The {{compatibility}} effect {{found in}} the <b>flanker</b> task is usually {{explained in terms of}} response slowing due to incompatible <b>flanker</b> properties. It is as yet unclear whether the compatibility effect is also due to facilitative effects associated with compatible <b>flanker</b> properties. An extension of the Continuous Flow model put forward by Eriksen & Schultz (1979) namely the "Accumulated Activation Strength Difference" (AASD) model is proposed that maintains both response facilitation - due to compatible <b>flanker</b> properties, and response slowing - due to incompatible <b>flanker</b> properties, takes place under conditions where there is response competition. A series of <b>flanker</b> task experiments were conducted that presented 2, 4 or 6 flankers and combined <b>flanker</b> types in terms of their compatibility. It was found that <b>flanker</b> conditions that contained an equal number of compatible and incompatible flankers generated faster RTs than conditions that contained purely incompatible flankers. There was also no difference in RTs for incompatible <b>flanker</b> conditions or compatible <b>flanker</b> conditions whether there were 2, 4 or 6 flankers. This suggests that the effects of compatible and incompatible flankers cancel each other out. Furthermore, another experiment varied the ratio of compatible to incompatible flankers in a 4 <b>flanker</b> array. It was found that the ratio of compatible to incompatible flankers within a stimulus array mediates the magnitude of the compatibility effect. There is some evidence that this effect also occurs across different stimulus dimensions. The model also offers an explanation for why no response facilitation is observed for compatible trials compared to target alone trials and can account for how the patterns of errors in <b>flanker</b> tasks usually mirror the RT data. However, the model is complete, for example, it makes no attempt to account for how neutral <b>flanker</b> properties affect responding...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVisual motion {{perception}} {{is essential for}} appropriate behavior in a dynamic visual world. It is influenced by voluntary attention towards or away from moving objects {{as well as by}} the capture of automatic attention by salient stimuli. Both kinds of attention play a major role in the Eriksen <b>Flanker</b> Task (EFT), where a central stimulus has to be identified in the presence of <b>flanking</b> distractors. For static visual stimuli incongruent peripheral flankers are known to reduce accuracy rates and prolong reaction times. However, it is not known if a similar <b>flanker</b> effect also affects speeded responses to moving stimuli. We therefore examined whether a <b>flanker</b> effect exists for moving random dot patterns (RDPs) and compared it to the effect elicited by static visual triangles in human subjects. We observed a motion <b>flanker</b> effect, both for response times and accuracy rates. Incongruently moving peripheral flankers caused a slowing of response time and a reduction of accuracy rates compared to congruently moving RDPs. These motion <b>flanker</b> effects were not significantly different from those in the static <b>flanker</b> task. The presence of a motion <b>flanker</b> effect and its similarity to the <b>flanker</b> effect for static stimuli suggests that visual motion engages competitive attention and control mechanisms for perception and decision-making similar to those engaged by non-moving features...|$|R
