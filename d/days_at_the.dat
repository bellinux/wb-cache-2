5|$|The tidal {{effect of}} the planets is weak and does not {{significantly}} affect {{the shape of the}} Sun. The Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles.

In a frame of reference defined by the stars, the rotational period is approximately 25.6 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> equator and 33.5 <b>days</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> poles. Viewed from Earth as it orbits the Sun, the apparent rotational period of the Sun at its equator is about 28 days.|$|E

Holopainen later explained that the band members had gradually realised that Turunen's voice had become too dramatic for acoustic mood music and eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that the music had to be massive too.
