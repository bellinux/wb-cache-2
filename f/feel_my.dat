On June 19, 2008, Lil Wayne and T-Pain formed a duo called T-Wayne with plans to release an album, titled He Raps, He Sings; however, those plans have died down due to much of the material recorded for the album being leaked. According to an interview with Drake, in the December 2011 issue of XXL, plans for an upcoming album with Lil Wayne had been scrapped for the time being because of the Jay-Z and Kanye West collaboration Watch the Throne (2011).|$|E

500|$|Thus, Khachaturian {{and other}} leading composers were denounced by the Communist Party as {{followers}} of the alleged formalism (i.e. [...] " [...] music that was considered too advanced or difficult for the masses to enjoy") and their music was dubbed [...] "anti-people". It was the Symphonic Poem (1947), later titled the Third Symphony, that officially earned Khachaturian {{the wrath of the}} Party. Ironically, he wrote the work as a tribute to the 30th anniversary of the October Revolution. He stated: [...] "I wanted to write the kind of composition in which the public would <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> unwritten program without an announcement. I wanted this work to express the Soviet people's joy and pride in their great and mighty country." ...|$|E

500|$|Goldfaden {{wrote that}} this {{attitude}} put him [...] "pure and simply {{at war with}} the public." [...] His stage was not to be merely [...] "a masquerade"; he continued: [...] "No, brothers. If I have arrived at having a stage, I want it to be a school for you. In youth you didn't have time to learn and cultivate yourself... Laugh heartily if I amuse you with my jokes, while I, watching you, <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> heart crying. Then, brothers, I'll give you a drama, a tragedy drawn from life, and you, too, shall cry – while my heart shall be glad." [...] Nonetheless, his [...] "war with the public" [...] was based on understanding that public. He would also write, [...] "I wrote Di kishefmakhern (The Witch) in Romania, where the populace – Jews as much as Romanians – believe strongly in witches." [...] Local superstitions and concerns always made good subject matter, and, as Bercovici remarks, however strong his inspirational and didactic intent, his historical pieces were always connected to contemporary concerns.|$|E

In 2015 Sarah and Fox published a picture book, Are You a Boy or are You a Girl?, which Sarah wrote and Fox illustrated. [...] "Before I started transitioning, I never wrote, I never... did anything creative," [...] said Sarah in a 2013 interview.

500|$|According to Spence D. of IGN Music, Beyoncé's vocals on {{the song}} are layered, making them sound like [...] "a harem of Beyoncé's {{warbling}} for the affections of some sultan of swing." [...] According to James Poletti of Yahoo! Music, the female protagonist {{in the song}} sings about her [...] "potential {{to turn on the}} filth." [...] Lyrically, the song is a celebration of sexual lust and conquest, culminating in a desire for a one-night stand. This [...] "lustful sexual confidence" [...] is further demonstrated in the lyrics of the first verse: [...] "I'm feeling sexy / Wa hear you say my name, boy/ If you can reach me, you can <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> burning flame / Feeling kind of N A S T Y / I might just take you home with me" [...] and the chorus lines: [...] " [...] Tonight I'll be your naughty girl / I'm callin' all my girls / We're gonna turn this party out / I know you want my body." [...] Throughout the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "I'd love to love you, baby" [...] almost whispering as stated by Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic.|$|E
500|$|While {{singing the}} lines [...] "So rock {{right up to}} the side of my {{mountain}} / Climb until you reach my peak babe my peak, the peak / And reach right into the bottom of my fountain", Beyoncé uses sexual innuendos. [...] She also incorporates similar double entendres and euphemisms in the lyrics, [...] "Reach right into the bottom of my fountain / dip me under to where you can <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> river flow / Rock it till water falls". During the end of the song, Beyoncé sings the lines [...] "You rock hard / I rock steady" [...] eventually [...] "erupting into an orgasmic finish" [...] as stated by Puja Patel of Spin. During the last part, she sings [...] "Goddamnit, I'm comfortable in my skin / And you're comfortable in my skin". It was noted that during the end of the song, the protagonist becomes ready to be sexually subordinate and [...] "discipline" [...] as opposed to the first part where she adopted a more dominant persona; this is further exemplified in the lines [...] "Punish me, punish me please" [...] where Beyoncé uses soft vocals.|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} the album, Mars said: [...] "I'm never singing another ballad again," [...] but {{that came from the}} gut – it's the most honest, real thing I've ever sung," [...] he says.

[...] "Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man. I've never been this nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno and I are both huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E

500|$|Padres {{general manager}} Kevin Towers said Hoffman {{was the first}} one in and the last one out of the {{ballpark}} everyday. Hoffman adhered to a daily conditioning program. When pitcher Jeremy Fikac was promoted to the majors in 2001, Hoffman invited him to join him on his usual afternoon run. [...] "I remember sitting in the bullpen that night, and my legs were still trembling from the run", Fikac recalled. [...] "I'd run before, but not at that pace ... I was thinking, I hope they don't call on me because I can't <b>feel</b> <b>my</b> legs under me ... His work ethic is unbelievable." [...] Bochy said, [...] " [...] one of those guys like Tony Gwynn—they never feel like they've arrived. Tony never thought, 'Well, I'm hitting [...]360 ... ' He was never content. And Trevor's the same way. They just keep working and make sure that they've got goals they want to reach." [...] After every save opportunity, whether he converted it or blew it, Hoffman would sit in the dugout for up to five minutes after his teammates had cleared out. Whether it was the euphoria from success or the sting of failure, he would sit there and drain all the emotion out of himself, put the game behind him, and move on. Tracy Hoffman said, [...] "He's all about order. That's the foundation to what he does. You see it when he's on the field. He's always the same, win or lose. He doesn't smile, doesn't show any emotion." [...] Padres manager Bud Black marveled at Hoffman's regimen. [...] "The daily preparation for his job, that focus and dedication each day to prepare for the ninth inning ... It was incredible to see live", said Black. [...] "I played with George Brett, a Hall of Famer who was a great worker. But Trevor took it to a level and a commitment and Hall of Fame caliber." [...] After Hoffman resurrected his final season and recorded his 600th save, Macha said Hoffman's [...] "work ethic and perseverance paid off ... He had to grind it out to get there." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Quarterback", Rachel is devastated {{with the}} loss of Finn. Michele, who in real life was dating Cory Monteith, had asked to {{postpone}} this episode until everyone was ready. Rachel doesn't appear in this episode until the very end where she states, [...] "Before Finn, I used to sing alone, {{this was one of the}} songs we would sing when we drove around together." [...] She sings [...] "Make You <b>Feel</b> <b>My</b> Love". Later in the episode, she states that Finn was her person and that they were always going to be together. Later in the season, it is revealed that she got a tattoo of Finn's name (despite telling Kurt that she chickened out when they went to the tattoo shop). Rachel hires Santana to be her publicist, which leads her to take on a charitable cause with a local rescue kennel. She performs with Mercedes and Santana on stage for the benefit, Broadway Bitches, but the publicity stunt goes wrong when the dogs pull her down and drag her for several blocks. Despite this, Santana reassures her and they discuss the next step in their campaign. Rachel lands the lead on the Broadway show, Funny Girl. Santana offers to be Rachel's understudy when Rachel is stuck in Los Angeles for a television show audition. Before the opening, she suffers from a bout of self-doubt, but performs after Santana gives her a pep talk. Lee Paulblatt, a Fox Television executive, sees Rachel perform, and is so impressed, he informs her wants to cast her in an upcoming, untitled television pilot. He has her meet with the famed screenwriter, Mary Halloran, who will be creating the script. After the first meeting, Rachel is confused by Mary's ideas and idiosyncratic behavior. Rachel has the group review Mary's script, and everyone agrees it is terrible (except Brittany). Rachel meets with Mary and tells her that the lead character does not sound like her. Mary points out that television viewers want anti-heroes, but Rachel responds by singing, and Mary, uncharacteristically, is moved and made happy by the performance. She agrees to redo the script, but warns Rachel that the network will never make a pilot from it. Eventually, the network loves the script and calls Rachel, and she moves to LA to start shooting her pilot.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Make You <b>Feel</b> <b>My</b> Love" [...] was {{recorded}} twice {{under the title}} [...] "To Make You <b>Feel</b> <b>My</b> Love" [...] by other artists: Billy Joel recorded the song for his Greatest Hits Volume III collection before Dylan released the song; subsequently, Garth Brooks recorded it for the Hope Floats soundtrack. It {{was recorded}} under the original title by Bryan Ferry on Dylanesque and by Adele on 19. This song was criticized for its lyrical inferiority by Robert Christgau and Greg Kot of Rolling Stone. In his review, Kot described the track as [...] "a spare ballad undermined by greetingcard lyrics [...] breaks the album's spell". Opposing his view, Dylan critic Paul Williams {{said that it was}} [...] "refreshing" [...] to his ears.
