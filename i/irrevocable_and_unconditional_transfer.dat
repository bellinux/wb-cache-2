40|$|Abstract: The {{austerity}} {{movement in}} high-income countries of Europe and North America has renewed {{calls for a}} guaranteed Basic Income. At the same time, conditional <b>and</b> <b>unconditional</b> cash <b>transfers</b> accompanied by rigorous impact evaluations have been conducted in low- and middle-income countries with the explicit support of the World Bank. Both Basic Income and cash transfer programs are more confidently designed when based on empirical evidence and social theory that explain how and why cash transfers to citizens are effective ways of encouraging investment in human capital through health and education spending. Are conditional cash transfers more effective and/or more efficient than <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers?</b> Are means-tested transfers effective? This essay draws explicit parallels between Basic Income <b>and</b> <b>unconditional</b> cash <b>transfers,</b> <b>and</b> demonstrates that cash transfers to citizens work in remarkably similar ways in low-, middle- and high-income countries. It addresses the theoretical foundation of cash transfers.

40|$|Intergovernmental {{transfers}} can {{be either}} conditional or unconditional {{with regard to the}} autonomy of local governments in spending such financial means. Although fiscal decentralisation has recently been quite pronounced in Eastern European transition countries, the dominance of a purpose- and project-oriented, down-flow transfer system is apparent. In the context of unification, the west German municipal resource allocation system was also implemented {{in the eastern part of}} the country, which provides primarily <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> for local governments. Furthermore, in the case of adopting the principle of parallel development of fiscal capacity between the state and municipalities, as Saxony already has done, the intergovernmental transfer ratio is no longer exogenously but endogenously determined, which better guarantees a just resource allocation between the two jurisdictions. Since the subsidiarity principle backed by sufficient own fiscal resources <b>and</b> <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> appears to gain significance in providing local utilities, this study shows the recent Saxon experience with the <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers,</b> which can be considered for the future fiscal devolution process of Eastern European transition countries. intergovernmental transfers, fiscal decentralisation, local expenditure needs, municipal tax revenues, vertical fiscal equalisation, Saxony, Germany, European transition economies...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographyThis {{paper has}} been {{prepared}} {{at the request}} of the Dubai Economic Council, and formed part of a monograph on Revenue-Sharing Experiences around the World, edited by Ehtisham Ahmad. The ICMS represents the most important source of revenue for the Brazilian states and one of the most important taxes in Brazil. Unlike other VATs in the world, the ICMS is not collected by the central government. The ICMS is collected by the states (the intermediate level of government), which are able to fix the internal rates; a situation that reflects the fiscal autonomy of the different levels of government in Brazil. Similarly, the direct <b>and</b> <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> of 25 % of the ICMS collection to the municipalities (the local level) show the high degree of autonomy at the sub–national level. However, fiscal autonomy is also a source of problems, particularly the “fiscal wars” that result from the different tax rates fixed by the states and its corresponding effects on transfers. To solve this and other problems related to Brazil’s tax system various proposals have been made, but none of them has actually materialized. The objective of this paper is to characterize Brazil’s fiscal federalism and tax system, with an emphasis in the ICMS and its revenue–sharing rules. We also provide some concluding remarks regarding ICMS and its revenue sharing. Introduction. [...] Characterization of Brazilian Fiscal Federalism and Tax System.

40|$|Cash {{transfer}} {{programs are}} widely used in settings where child labor is prevalent. Although many of these programs are explicitly implemented to improve children's welfare, in theory their impact on child labor is undetermined. This paper systematically reviews the empirical evidence {{on the impact of}} cash <b>transfers,</b> conditional <b>and</b> <b>unconditional,</b> on child labor. We find no evidence that cash transfer interventions increase child labor in practice. On the contrary, there is broad evidence that conditional <b>and</b> <b>unconditional</b> cash <b>transfers</b> lower both children's participation in child labor and their hours worked and that these transfers cushion the effect of economic shocks that may lead households to use child labor as a coping strategy. Boys experience particularly strong decreases in economic activities, whereas girls experience such decreases in household chores. Our findings underline the usefulness of cash transfers as a relatively safe policy instrument to improve child welfare but also point to knowledge gaps, for instance regarding the interplay between cash transfers and other interventions, that should be addressed in future evaluations to provide detailed policy advic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the implications of}} political factors for social policy choices.

Due to the direct nature of benefits, <b>unconditional</b> <b>transfers</b> {{are more likely to}} be used to buy off opposition and prevent social unrest. As transfers that are conditioned on education and health pay off only in a relatively distant future, they are rarely initiated for political motives and rather defined by interests of long-term development and human capital accumulation. Using the new dataset on Non-Contributory Social Transfer Programs (NSTP) in developing countries, we find that transfers are indeed chosen so as to be unconditional under less democratic regimes. There is some evidence that conditional transfers {{are more likely to be}} adopted in democracies. In particular, democracies tend to increase the number of conditional schemes once any social transfer program is introduced...|$|R

30|$|The basic {{economic}} model of labor supply {{has a very}} clear prediction of what we should expect when an adult receives an unexpected cash windfall: they should work less and earn less. This intuition underlies concerns that many types of cash transfers, ranging from government benefits to migrant remittances, will undermine work ethics and make recipients lazy. We discuss a range of additional channels to this simple labor-leisure trade-off that can make this intuition misleading in low- and middle-income countries, including missing markets, price effects from conditions attached to transfers, and dynamic and general equilibrium effects. We {{use this as a}} lens through which to examine the evidence on the adult labor market impacts {{of a wide range of}} cash transfer programs: government transfers, charitable giving and humanitarian transfers, remittances, cash assistance for job search, cash transfers for business start-up, and bundled interventions. Overall, cash transfers that are made without an explicit employment focus (such as conditional <b>and</b> <b>unconditional</b> cash <b>transfers,</b> <b>and</b> remittances) tend to result in little to no change in adult labor. The main exceptions are transfers to the elderly and to some refugees, who reduce work. In contrast, transfers made for job search assistance or business start-up tend to increase adult labor supply and earnings, with the likely main channels being the alleviation of liquidity and risk constraints.|$|R
40|$|Most impact {{evaluations}} of conditional cash <b>transfers</b> <b>and</b> <b>unconditional</b> cash <b>transfers</b> {{focus on the}} returns to increased human capital investments that will be reaped largely or exclusively in the future (that is, when current children have increased productivity as adults). But such programs aim not only to increase human capital investments with implications on future distributions of income but also to alleviate current poverty and reduce current inequality. This paper considers the current distributional gains from such programs and how those depend {{on the degree of}} inequality aversion in the social welfare function. Simulations show that for a range of inequality aversion parameters, the welfare gains from current redistribution for the Mexican PROGRESA conditional cash transfer program are as large, or possibly much larger, than the estimated present discounted value of future earnings from human capital investments in lower and upper secondary schooling. These, moreover, are an underestimate of the gains from redistribution because, in addition to current gains, such gains will be augmented in the future through the distribution of the returns on the human capital investments induced by cash transfer programs. Therefore, to fully evaluate such programs, it is critical to incorporate the distributional gains, not only the impacts on human capital investments.

The LEAP aims at <b>transferring</b> conditional <b>and</b> <b>unconditional</b> cash <b>transfers</b> to the extremely poorest households in the country. The rationale is to empower the poor and vulnerable categories in the country so as to boost economic development. The study assessed the implementation of the LEAP in two {{different parts of the country}} (Ghana), North (Savelugu District) and South (Ga South Municipality). The main aim was to know the factors that contributed to any differences or similarities that existed as far as the extent of effective implementation of LEAP in these two parts of the country is concerned. Therefore indicators such as effective targeting of beneficiaries, regular and consistent payment of grants to beneficiaries, effectively linking beneficiaries to complementary services like NHIS etc were assessed. Based on these assessment criteria, factors such as politics, resource capacity (financial & Human), administrative structure and target group behaviours were used in analysing the differences and similarities that contributed to the level of effectiveness in the implementation of LEAP. Using a qualitative research method, data (Interviews, Focus Group Discussions, observations and documents) were compiled and analysed and with Winters Integrating Model, Meter and Horn Model of Implementation and Bo Rothstein Implementation Model as theoretical frameworks, the study concluded that, even though other factors may had affected the differences that existed in the extent of effective implementation of the LEAP, level political interferences, human resource and the target group behaviour are the three most important factors that had contributed to the variations that existed between Savelugu District (North) and Ga South Municipality (South. ...|$|R
