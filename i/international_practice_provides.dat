40|$|Carbon taxes create {{incentives}} for controlling greenhouse gases {{by putting a}} price on these emissions. In theory major carbon emitters would pay more under an effective carbon tax. In practice political considerations often dominate and consequently compromise effectiveness in emissions mitigation. Australia's carbon pricing mechanism is a recent example. It {{involves the use of}} a fixed-price instrument that resembles a carbon tax and will eventually turn into an emission trading scheme and enable price fluctuation. The policy design is however questionable for overcompensating big polluters and legitimizing the failure to curb emissions domestically. This paper offers a review of the development of carbon tax policies in various national contexts with a focus on Australia. Lessons from the <b>international</b> <b>practices</b> could <b>provide</b> a useful reference for China to advance its timely commitment to establishing a carbon pricing system.

40|$|Governments {{worldwide}} {{are encouraging}} public agencies to join e-Government initiatives {{in order to}} provide better services to their citizens and businesses; hence, methods of evaluating the readiness of individual public agencies to execute specific e-Government programs and directives are a key ingredient in the successful expansion of e-Government. To satisfy this need, a model called the eGovernment Maturity Model (eGov-MM) was developed, integrating the assessment of technological, organizational, operational, and human capital capabilities, under a multi-dimensional, holistic, and evolutionary approach. The model is strongly supported by <b>international</b> best <b>practices,</b> and <b>provides</b> tuning mechanisms to enable its alignment with nation-wide directives on e-Government. This article describes how the model was conceived, designed, developed, field tested by expert public officials from several government agencies, and finally applied to a selection of 30 public agencies in Chile, generating the first formal measurements, assessments, and rankings of their readiness for e-Government. The implementation of the model also provided several recommendations to policymakers at the national and agency levels...|$|R

40|$|Construction {{boasts a}} vast {{worldwide}} literature, but few books take an international overview or draw on relevant technologies outside construction. This book fills those gaps, {{concentrating on the}} UK but also investigating <b>international</b> <b>practice.</b> It <b>provides</b> both a historian’s and a forecaster’s perspective on building and its planning context. Outcomes included: • a nationwide speaking tour on the book • joining the Board of the Housing Forum, a body that, with government support until recently, represents all stakeholders in UK housing • contributing to the Construction Research and Innovation Strategy Panel (CRISP) paper, The social and economic value of construction: the Pearce report revisited, August 2004 • lecturing to major conferences on housing, engaging with top civil servants at the Department of Communities and Local Government (CLG) • a series of broadcasts on housing for Radio 4. My book engaged in contemporary debates {{in the field and}} since publication, the Government has decided to build three million new homes by 2020. In an original manner, the book subjects the complexities of building to interdisciplinary perspectives, including those of economics, urban geography and the management of marketing and innovation. The book makes the novel suggestion that mass-produced buildings, granted Type Approvals, could be located beyond brown-field sites in the UK, so offering householders more space, better architecture, lower energy use and lower house prices. The rigour of the research consists in its comprehensive survey of international opinion on building, as well its insistence on always asking the question: why should the quality and price dynamics of buildings be any different from those of other products...|$|R
40|$|With {{respect to}} the {{particular}} empirical domain and historical period that this paper examines, a conceptual focus on symbols {{makes it possible to}} construct a narrative that brings together a host of symbolic Franco-German practices between the late 1950 s {{and the end of the}} century. As isolated events all of these episodes and pieces are well documented. However, only the conceptual tool that this article develops provides the means to assemble these manifold incidents and occurrences into a coherent whole, to comprehend their connectedness, and to appreciate the social meaning with its characteristic effects that these symbolic acts generate and perpetuate in their entirety. In sum, in this paper I pursue three goals. First, I distinguish the concept of “predominantly symbolic acts and practices among states” and define symbolic acts as a distinct category of <b>international</b> <b>practice.</b> I <b>provide</b> the conceptual framework to capture important international social content as well as to appreciate the effects of such meaning and social purpose. Second, with this conceptual addition, I systematically explore the empirical manifestation of such acts, and the meaning and purpose they help to institutionalize, for the bilateral relationship between France and Germany between the late 1950 s and mid- 1990 s. I specify their substance and review their meaning. Third, I propose to view symbolic practices and their effects as elements of international social structure of interaction and meaning, and, as such, to consider them and the meaning they embody as ontological building blocks of international life. Doing so, in this paper I connect symbols to a social-structural style of international analysis. Both conceptually and empirically, this article attempts to fill a gap in the literature. It is as much about the “special” Franco-German relationship as it is about important ontological issues in international relations theory...|$|R
