5|$|Payton {{performed}} with his teammates in the widely released 1985 music video The Super Bowl Shuffle. The Bears {{went on to}} a 15–1 record that culminated in a 46–10 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl XX. Although Payton's offensive prowess had assisted the Bears throughout the 1985 season, he did not score any touchdowns in the postseason and the New England Patriots prevented him from reaching the end zone in the Super Bowl. According to quarterback Jim McMahon, he was targeted by two or three defenders on <b>every</b> <b>play,</b> and others stated that Payton's mere presence allowed others to shine, given that at least 2 people were targeting Payton on <b>every</b> <b>play.</b> In a later interview, Ditka stated that one of his major regrets was Payton's lack of a touchdown in the Super Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat {{his players}} down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested {{them on their}} knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy down <b>every</b> <b>play</b> in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E
5|$|Arguably {{the most}} notable game of Heisman's career was the most {{lopsided}} victory in college football history. In 1916, Cumberland College ended its football program and attempted to cancel a scheduled game with Heisman's Jackets. Heisman, however, was seeking vengeance for a 22–0 baseball loss to Cumberland {{in the spring of}} 1916, a game in which Heisman suspected Cumberland of hiring professional players to pose as Cumberland students. Heisman refused the game's cancellation and Cumberland mustered up a group of commonfolk to play Tech. Tech won 222–0. Neither team achieved a first down other than a touchdown, as Cumberland either punted or turned the ball over before a first down and Tech scored on almost <b>every</b> <b>play</b> from scrimmage. Jim Preas, Tech's kicker, kicked 16 point after tries, which is still a record for a single game.|$|E

5|$|The {{tactical}} {{decision that}} precedes almost <b>every</b> <b>play</b> in {{a baseball game}} involves pitch selection. By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner, and by throwing it at a certain speed, pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side, or downward, as it approaches the batter. Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown, the four basic types are the fastball, the changeup (or off-speed pitch), and two breaking balls—the curveball and the slider. Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing. Conventionally, before each pitch, the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw, {{as well as its}} general vertical and/or horizontal location. If there is disagreement on the selection, the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch. With a runner on base and taking a lead, the pitcher may attempt a pickoff, a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner's lead in check or, optimally, effect a tag out. Pickoff attempts, however, are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher's movements before and during the pickoff attempt. Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher, with the result being runners on base, if any, advance one base with impunity. If an attempted stolen base is anticipated, the catcher may call for a pitchout, a ball thrown deliberately off the plate, allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base. Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit {{to one side of the}} field, the fielding team may employ a shift, with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions. With a runner on third base, the infielders may play in, moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball, though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn-in infield.|$|E

25|$|In 1893 {{he moved}} to Buchtel College, where he helped make {{the first of many}} {{permanent}} alterations to the sport of football. It was then customary for the center to begin a play by rolling the ball backwards, but this was troublesome for Buchtel's unusually tall quarterback, Harry Clark. Under Heisman, the center began tossing the ball to Clark, a practice that evolved into the snap that today begins <b>every</b> <b>play.</b>|$|E

25|$|A Voice and Text Director is {{assigned}} to <b>every</b> <b>play</b> from pre-production through the opening performance. OSF employs two full-time voice and text directors {{and one or two}} guest artists each year to meet the demand for these specialists. They help the actors and directors craft vocal choices that will be theatrically effective and sustainable through the run of the show. This can involve work on posture, breath support, resonant placement, muscularity of articulation and screaming technique. They also work with the actors on the text of the play, often in one-on-one sessions. This can include examination of meter, rhythm, sound patterning such as alliteration and rhyme, imagery, and rhetorical structure and devices such as antithesis and repetition. When required, they coach the actors in accents and dialects based on samples of native speakers and work with each actor to find a sound that is as authentic as possible to the character's background but also intelligible in a contemporary theatrical context and conducive to that individual's acting process.|$|E
25|$|Missouri {{started off}} {{the fourth quarter}} with an {{incomplete}} pass that made it 4th and goal at the Oklahoma 15. Wolfert made his third field goal of the game to make the score 28–17, Oklahoma. The Sooners then drove down the field and, {{after a couple of}} redzone plays, Bradford found Joe Jon Finley for the touchdown. Hartley went to 5 of 5 on the night, making the score 35–17, Oklahoma. At this point, the West Virginia Mountaineers had just lost their game to the Pittsburgh Panthers, meaning that the top two teams were in danger of losing. Missouri took the ball and quickly went three-and-out. The Sooners put together a drive in which <b>every</b> <b>play</b> that advanced the ball was a run (Bradford had one incomplete pass), eating over six minutes off of the clock. Oklahoma couldn't get the ball across the goal line, though, and Hartley kicked the 26yard field goal to make the score 38–17, Sooners. Missouri would go three-and-out on their final possession and Oklahoma ran out the clock to win the game. This was Oklahoma's 41st conference championship and fifth Big 12 Championship. Oklahoma won each of their five titles with a different quarterback and is the first and only team in the Big 12 to win consecutive titles.|$|E

[...] At the end of his junior year, he was chosen All American, and {{recognized as one of the}} greatest defense players in the country. [...] He was alert, followed <b>every</b> <b>play,</b> and opponents found it almost impossible to gain around his end." [...] In 1955, Kipke rated Petoskey as one of the six best players he ever coached: [...] "If I had to name the best player I ever coached, it would have to be among Harry Newman, Francis Wistert, Otto Pommerening, Ted Petoskey and Maynard Morrison." ...|$|E

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1932 season, the Chicago Bears and the Portsmouth Spartans {{were tied}} with the best regular-season records. To {{determine}} the champion, the league voted to hold its first playoff game. Because of cold weather, the game was held indoors at Chicago Stadium, which forced some temporary rule changes. Chicago won, 9–0. The playoff proved so popular that the league reorganized into two divisions for the 1933 season, with the winners advancing to a scheduled championship game. A number of new rule changes were also instituted: the goal posts were moved forward to the goal line, <b>every</b> <b>play</b> started from between the hash marks, and forward passes could originate from anywhere behind the line of scrimmage (instead of the previous five yards behind). [...] In 1936, the NFL instituted the first draft of college players. With the first ever draft selection, the Philadelphia Eagles picked Heisman Trophy winner Jay Berwanger, but he declined to play professionally. Also in that year, another AFL formed, but it also lasted only two seasons.|$|E

That season the Browns {{captured}} the NFL title and then reached but lost the following three championship games. Collier's coaching style was the opposite of Brown's; Brown was a disciplinarian whose stern nature and aloofness often brought him into conflict with players, while Collier was a friendly, warm man whose patience and studiousness endeared him to players. [...] "Everything had to be perfect; he was a stickler on perfection – but at the same time, he had great patience," [...] Browns quarterback Otto Graham said in 2007. After the 1946 season, Brown asked Collier to analyze <b>every</b> <b>play</b> run by the offense, and Collier came up with a detailed breakdown of why each play succeeded or failed. This was the genesis of an annual grading system Collier developed to evaluate players' performance. The Browns used it for many years.|$|E
