5000|$|<b>Kingklip</b> {{were heavily}} {{exploited}} in the 1980s, and populations {{have not yet}} recovered so that some precautions are in place. Being relatively slow-growing and long-lived, stocks cannot sustain the pressure of targeted fishing, and are taken only as a bycatch species. It {{is one of the}} economically important species to South African fisheries. The related species from New Zealand, Genypterus blacodes, has made its way to South African markets and is retailed as <b>kingklip.</b> Kingklip's lack of obvious scales has sparked lively and ongoing debate in Jewish circles as to whether it qualifies as kosher or treif.|$|E
50|$|The {{southern}} lanternfish, Lampanyctus australis, is a lanternfish of {{the family}} Myctophidae, found circumglobally in the southern hemisphere between 33° S and 44° S, mainly at below 500 m. Its length is about 13 cm. It is an oceanic mesopelagic species, eaten by hakes, <b>kingklip</b> and Cape horse mackerel.|$|E
5000|$|Marine {{protected}} areas (closed to {{all forms of}} fishing) have been introduced {{for a number of}} reasons and some impact on deep sea trawling. For example, a specific time/area closure is aimed at protecting <b>kingklip</b> spawning grounds.

50|$|Genypterus capensis (Smith, 1847), {{commonly}} known as <b>kingklip,</b> is a species of cusk eel occurring along the Southern African coast from Walvis Bay in Namibia to Algoa Bay in South Africa, and {{is closely related to}} Genypterus blacodes from New Zealand. The species grows to a maximum length of 180 cm, a weight of 15.0 kg, {{and is one of the}} most popular fish items on South African menus. Despite appearances it is not closely related to the eel familyof Anguilliformes.|$|E
50|$|In Walvis Bay {{there are}} {{different}} fishing companies like Hangana Seafood, Caroline Fishing, Benguella Fishing Company, Etale Fishing Company, Cadilu Fishing, Etosha Fisheries, Kuiseb Fishing Enterprises, Blue Ocean Products, Benguella Sea Products, Consortium Fisheries, Talanam Fish Processor. These companies catch different types of fish like snoek, horse mackerel, anchovy, steenbras, kabeljou, <b>kingklip,</b> hake, catfish, tuna and sardines. Hangana Seafood are processors and exporters of fish and fish products.As such, the fishing enterprise accounts for {{a major part of}} Walvis Bay's economy.|$|E
5000|$|Andrew Smith, the redoubtable Scots {{explorer}} and zoologist, {{first described}} the <b>kingklip</b> in 1847 from a specimen caught {{near the entrance}} to Table Bay and named it Xiphiurus capensis ('xiphos'=sword, 'oura'=tail). His description was published in [...] "Illustrations of the zoology of South Africa", an account of the natural history objects he collected during his expedition into the interior of South Africa in 1834-36. It was also described by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1858 and named Hoplophycis lalandi.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kingklip</b> {{occur at}} depths from 50 - 500 m, but {{usually in the}} range 250 - 350 m. They are bottom-dwelling and inhabit rocky localities on the shelf and upper {{continental}} slope. Juveniles are more often found in shallow waters. They feed on dragonets, mantis shrimps, hake, squid, and various fish species. Spawning usually takes place from August to October. The species is oviparous, with oval pelagic eggs floating in a gelatinous mass. Their dorsal soft rays number 150, while the anal soft rays number 110. The head and body are normally pink to orange in colour, with dark blotches dorsally.|$|E
5000|$|The South African Journal of Marine Science, in Volume 8, Issue 1 of 1989, {{published}} {{a description of}} the species' larval development in the southern Benguela Current. The distribution of <b>kingklip</b> larvae was studied over a 12-month period, and yielded data on spawning areas and breeding seasons. The researchers concluded that there are different spawning strategies for the western Agulhas Bank and the West Coast. On the Agulhas Bank, spawning is initiated by a decrease in sea surface temperature, whereas on the West Coast, spawning only occurs when upwelling has decreased i.e. between June and December. [...] Females grow larger than males in both areas, but are slower growing.|$|E
5000|$|Cape horse {{mackerel}} is a bycatch {{species in the}} offshore demersal trawl, which operates mainly off {{the waters of the}} Western Cape at depths of 110m and deeper. The offshore demersal trawl fishery operates using trawl nets which are dragged behind the boat along the ocean floor at depths from 110 - 800 m. Cape {{horse mackerel}} caught in the midwater trawl fishery are considered to be more sustainable than those caught in the offshore trawl fishery (see Cape horse mackerel assessment for midwater trawl). This fishery primarily targets deepwater hake (Merluccius paradoxus) on soft, sandy bottoms, as well as commercially valuable bycatch species such as <b>kingklip</b> (Genypterus capensis) and monkfish (Lophius vomerinus). Although trawling is a highly unselective fishing method, offshore fishing grounds are not generally very biodiverse (i.e. they are only inhabited by a few species) and the discard rate for this fishery is estimated to be 10% of the total catch. However, this fishing method is likely to have significant impacts on bottom habitats and concerns are expressed around the number of seabird mortalities caused during trawling (estimated at 8000 per year). The hake component of the offshore demersal trawl fishery has been certified by the Marine Stewardship Council since 2004, and the current management system for this fishery employs a number of ecosystem-based management measures which address issues such as bycatch, closed areas and benthic habitat impacts. The Cape horse mackerel is managed in terms of a maximum precautionary catch Limit (MPCL). The MPCL has been maintained at 44 000 tonnes in recent years and accommodates both mid-water-directed and bycatch in the hake-directed demersal trawl sector. Juvenile horse mackerel are occasionally targeted on the West Coast where a 5 000 tonnes precautionary catch limit is enforced (the whole small pelagic sector is closed if the limit is exceeded). Despite the absence of direct evidence of ecosystem change, a potential for ecosystem impact exists, as this is an important small pelagic species, and fills a similar ecosystem niche to other small pelagic species such as sardine and anchovy.|$|E
5000|$|In South Africa, hake is {{targeted}} by four distinct fisheries: the offshore and inshore demersal trawl fisheries, and the hake longline and hake handline sectors. The offshore demersal trawl fishery {{is by far}} the biggest of the four. Approximately 84% of the hake total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated to the offshore demersal trawl fishery. The inshore trawl and hake longline fisheries are each allocated approximately 6% of the TAC and the handline fishery presently accounts for about 3% of the allocation, although this has not been caught in recent years. [...] Trawling for hake takes place in a near continuous band on well-established grounds that extend from the Namibian border on the west coast to the extreme eastern part of the Agulhas Bank off the south-east coast. [...] Exploitation is predominantly at depths of between 300 to 800m on the west coast and less than 200m on the south coast. [...] The offshore demersal trawl fleet consists of 52 trawlers. Twenty-seven fresh fish trawlers preserve hake on ice and return it to shore for processing, while 18 freezer vessels produce frozen headed and gutted (H&G) hake. Seven more sophisticated freezer trawlers produce frozen fillets at sea [...] The gear configuration consists of “otter trawls” - gear towed along the seabed with trawl doors (or otter boards) keeping the mouth of the net open. Trawlers generally tow their nets at 3.5 knots for one to three hours, mainly in daylight when targeting hake [...] Trawling occurs mainly over sandy sediments, but areas of muddy substrate and coarser, gravely substrates are also trawled [...] A five-year (2014-2019) benthic trawl experiment is currently underway [...] The purpose of the experiment is to determine the environmental impact of demersal trawling in South African waters. It is being implemented by SADSTIA in partnership with the South African Department of Agriculture, Forestry & Fisheries, the University of Cape Town, the South African Environmental Observation Network and the South African National Biodiversity Institute. The catch of the offshore demersal trawl sector amounts to approximately 130 000 tonnes per year (2013 catches) [...] although this has varied between 118 and 166 000 tonnes, and consists of approximately 90% M. paradoxus and 10% M. capensis. The main bycatch species are <b>kingklip</b> (Genypterus capensis) and monk (Lophius vomerinus). Trawler owners and operators produce a mix of fresh and frozen products, supplying them to retail and food-service markets both locally and internationally. The main export markets are in Europe, Australia and the United States.|$|E
40|$|The South African {{demersal}} longline {{experiment is}} assessed {{with emphasis on}} the target species, <b>kingklip</b> Genypterus capensis. The hypothesis that <b>kingklip</b> on the South African coast comprise a unit stock is tested. Recommendations {{for the management of}} the fishery are made. Longlining was found to be commercially viable. Techniques have been developed to target on either <b>kingklip</b> or the Cape hakes, Herluccius capensis and H. paradoxus. Longline fishermen exploit the <b>kingklip</b> spawner stock from August to No v ember by taking advantage of prespawning aggregations on the South-East Coast. Effort switches to the West Coast in late summer and early winter where <b>kingklip</b> are less abundant and a larger proportion of hake is caught. Catch rates of <b>kingklip</b> on the South Coast have declined sharply and the resource there has been exploited at a rate greater than that required to retain 50 % of the unexploited biomass. There is a 17, 6 % probability that the spawner biomass on the South Coast has already been depleted below its pristine level. On the West Coast the catch rates of <b>kingklip</b> are lower than on the South Coast and have not changed significantly, although within the 95 % confidence limits {{there is a possibility that}} the resource there has also been depleted below 50 % of its pristine level. Genypterus capensis on the South African coast comprise a unit stock. Comparison of <b>kingklip</b> morphology using multivariate and discriminant function analysis and of otolith morphology using univariate statistics shows that there are no significant differences between the fish on the West and South Coasts. They are a slow growing species and were aged up to 25 years. <b>Kingklip</b> on the West Coast are smaller and have a lower L~ than those on the South Coast, but this is not a characteristic of discrete stocks. <b>Kingklip</b> on the South Coast mature earlier than those on the West Coast and aggregate to spawn on the South - East Coast in spring. There is no obvious spawning period on the West Coast. It is hypothesized that <b>kingklip</b> spawning on the South-East Coast is in response to favourable environmental conditions that enhances the survival of their eggs and larvae. It is recommended that demersal longlining be established as a permanent kingklip-directed fishery but that effort should not be allowed to increase. The West and South Coasts should be managed. separately. A TAC of 5 OOOt for <b>kingklip</b> should be introduced for 1989 of which 2 OOOt should be allocated to the West Coast and 3 OOOt to the South Coast. A closed season for <b>kingklip</b> from 1 August to 30 September on the South-East Coast is recommended. Hake-directed longlining should not be allowed as its effect on the hake spawner stocks are unknown and could be a potential threat to the stability of the demersal trawl fishery...|$|E

40|$|Information {{pertaining}} to the commercial availability of fish species in South Africa remains sparse, {{even though it is}} crucial for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions in favour of their own well being and the well being of the environment. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the most commonly available fish species in South Africa by means of surveys of restaurants (n = 215) and retail outlets (n = 200) and to assess the conservation statuses of the observed species. Furthermore, the processing states in which fish were mostly sold (fresh, frozen, whole or filleted) and the quality of information available to consumers on fish at the point of sale were evaluated. <b>Kingklip</b> was found to be the most commonly marketed fish species in restaurants, while hake was observed most frequently in retail outlets. More than 30 % of the observed species were of conservation concern and included, amongst others, <b>kingklip,</b> kabeljou (kob), east- and west coast soles and geelbek. Specially-protected, illegal-to-sell fish in South Africa, such as white steenbras, white musselcracker and Natal stumpnose, were marketed in restaurants and retail outlets. This study highlighted the poor ability of fish purveyors in South Africa to provide information on the identity, origin, production method and sustainability of fish being sold. Additionally, the labelling of many packaged fish products in retail outlets was in contravention with South African regulations. Poor vendor awareness, disparate naming practices and the highly processed nature of fishery products provide an opportunity for unintentional or deliberate mislabelling of fish in South Africa. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A semi-quantitative {{assessment}} {{is made of}} the animals observed in archived videotapes taken from the research submersible Jago, during diamond mining and exploratory surveys off {{the mouth of the}} Orange River on the west coast of southern Africa (28 ° 15 ′S, 29 ° 11 ′S) in November 1996. The seabed environment is described and nekton associations with substratum features are identified. The area is characterized by heterogeneity to its physical and biological struture. The variety of observed nekton is low, and communities are dominated by goby Sufflogobius bibarbatus, juvenile hake Merluccius spp. and cuttlefish Sepia spp. (on soft substrata), as well as false jacopever Sebastes capensis and <b>kingklip</b> Genypterus capensis (on rocky substrata). ...|$|E
40|$|The {{deterministic}} Age-Structured Production Model (ASPM) {{assessment of}} the <b>kingklip</b> resource by Mori and Butterworth (2002) is updated {{to take account of}} further catch and abundance survey data that have since become available for the years 2000 to 2007. The assessment is conducted for the West coast and the South coast separately, and compared to a retrospective model fit up to 1999. The model is fit to two different sources of data: the trawl abundance surveys, and the CPUE series for both trawl and longline catches. When steepness h is set to 0. 5, the spawning biomass of the West coast component shows a recovery since 1992; however, that of the South coast component shows a continuing decrease since 1995. The spawning biomass relative to its unexploited equilibrium level (Bsp/Ksp) for the South coast is 0. 12 for the base case scenario (h = 0. 5). This is a consequence of the continued high catches by the trawl fishery over the last decade on the South coast, though these have declined more recently. These analyses suggest that, if the South coast component of the resource is an isolated stock, then annual South coast catches by the trawl fishery would need to be reduced to below 1 000 tons at least for sustainability. Several sensitivity tests were conducted for the South coast base case scenario, however there is no substantial impact on the estimated status of this component of the <b>kingklip</b> resource. The resource is assessed as a single stock through the crude approach of summarising survey estimates for the two coasts; this unexpectedly leads to estimated status which is better than that for either coast considered separately. This result suggests the need for further investigations using both more elaborate modelling assumptions and further data, and some specific suggestions are made in this regard...|$|E

40|$|Videotapes {{collected}} by the research submersible Jago in the Benguela ecosystem during spring 1997 were analyzed to determine demersal nekton assemblage composition, fish behavior, and microscale habitat association, and habitat selection. Demersal fish assemblage diversity was generally low, and their composition was a function of substratum type. Individual species showed an often marked association with either rocky or soft substrata (or both), and a strong or weak selection for the associated biota. Soles and dragonets actively selected areas of bioactive soft substrata, {{to which they are}} behaviorally and morphologically adapted. False jacopever were associated with crevices in areas of high-relief rocky substrata. <b>Kingklip</b> are piscivorous and were largely confined to holes at the base of rocks and favored areas without a conspicuous epifauna. Juvenile hake and gobies avoided extremely rocky areas and were largely indifferent to the presence of benthic invertebrates—behavior that is consistent with their planktonic diets. These results represent the first direct observations of demersal nekton in the region and are important because they allow better interpretations of the results of trawl studies...|$|E
40|$|This paper updates the <b>kingklip</b> {{assessment}} by Brandão and Butterworth presented {{earlier this}} year by taking further data into account. Further, the analysis which treats the resource on both West and South coasts as a single stock is extended to take catch-at-length data into account. If the resource is treated as two separate stocks, current (2008) depletion of spawning biomass on the West and South coasts is estimated at 0, 50 and 0. 12 respectively. A more optimistic picture is obtained with the resource treated as a single stock, which yields a current depletion estimate of 0. 36, which increases to 0. 52 if the catch-at-length data are incorporated. Projections indicate that if the South coast component of the resource is a separate stock, then catches would need to be reduced to below 1 000 tons at least for sustainability. However if the two coasts combined are treated as a single stock, projections under current catch levels suggest a slight decrease for the assessment excluding catch-at-length data, which changes to a slight increase when those catch-at-length data are also taken into account. ...|$|E

For the case of cooked fillets the scheme is based on six attributes, with a scoring system from I to 5, where a score of five is best quality. Sensory analysis of cooked fillets was carried out parallel to sensory analysis of raw H&G and skinless fillets as well as microbial count study until 18 days of storage.

This enumeration method was suitable for indicating time and temperature related abuse in the processing system. This method was sensitive in indicating the level of processing complexity. The aerobic bacteria enumerations at 20 °C (SWA) were compared to the current EU/FDA (European Union/Federal Drug Administration USA) standard procedure testing samples on Plate Count Agar, (PCA) incubated at 30 - 35 °C. The method using SWA incubated at 20 °C provided better and more accurate bacterial counts under "good" and "poor" manufacturing practice.
