40|$|AbstractIn today's {{world the}} {{conventional}} metal <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> used in buses are being replaced with plastic <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks.</b> In this paper, {{a part of}} the project which aims to develop a computer aided methodology for developing/designing of the plastic <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> based on static and dynamic analysis is presented. Coupon tests are conducted to acquire the mechanical properties of the plastic material. In the static analysis, equivalent static loads are applied to the <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks.</b> In the dynamic analysis, the time varying loading and the inertia of the fluid and <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> are taken into account using modal transient analysis...|$|R
50|$|The {{manufacture}} of diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> is strictly governed by safety regulations. <b>Fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> of a capacity greater than 25 US gallons must adhere to specifications for spillage, leakage, mounting, impact survivability, weld requirements, venting {{and a host}} of other stipulations. The regulations require side-mounted <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> to survive a 30-foot drop test, while non side-mounted <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> must survive a 10-foot drop test. Clear specifications are given as to what constitutes a successful drop test and how to conduct the test. The regulations also require, among other things, that <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> pass a leakage test and a flame test. The procedures for conducting the tests are detailed in the regulations.|$|R
50|$|Some ISU-152s were {{equipped}} with even larger external <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks,</b> two tanks {{on the rear}} hull deck, {{in addition to the}} four external <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> (90 litres each, maximum), or with two smaller additional external <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks,</b> on the hull rear. This option was probably available for the post-war ISU-152 variants.|$|R
5|$|He 111 P-4: Fitted {{with extra}} armour, three extra MG 15s, and {{provisions}} for two externally mounted bomber racks. Powerplants consisted of DB601A-1s. The internal bomb bay {{was replaced with}} an 835 L <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> and a 120 L oil tank. Some H-4s were also fitted with Jumo 211H-1s.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} leg, on Friday, 2 May, at the seventh {{kilometre}} of the 18th stage, Corte–Taverna, Toivonen's Lancia {{went off the}} side of the road at a tight left corner with no guardrail. The car plunged down a ravine and crashed on its roof. The aluminium <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> underneath the driver's seat was ruptured by the trees and exploded. The <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> was not protected by a skid plate, an item used mainly on gravel rallies, which was not fitted for the all-asphalt Tour de Corse. The explosion happened within seconds of the crash, and Toivonen and his co-driver, Sergio Cresto would not have time to get out had they still been alive. The fire caused by the explosion was so intense that the Delta S4, built of fast-burning kevlar-reinforced plastic composite, was unidentifiable as a car afterwards. Both Toivonen and Cresto died in their seats. Toivonen left behind wife Erja (married in 1982) and two young children, son Markus and daughter Arla, while Cresto was single with no children.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, OO-DLL, a DHL Airbus A300, {{was struck}} by a surface-to-air missile shortly after departing from Baghdad International Airport, Iraq. The missile struck the port-side wing, rupturing a <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> and causing the loss of all three {{hydraulic}} systems. With the flight controls disabled, the crew used differential thrust to execute a safe landing at Baghdad.|$|E

25|$|Conformal <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> (CFTs) or 'Fast Packs' are {{additional}} <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> fitted {{closely to the}} profile of an aircraft which extend either the range or endurance of the aircraft, with a reduced aerodynamic penalty compared to external drop tanks.|$|R
5|$|In November 1982, Bahrain {{became the}} first customer. South Korea also {{explored}} local production of the F-20, and in support improvements were implemented. These included avionics upgrades, an expanded <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> {{and the use of}} fibreglass composites. The changes were so extensive that a fourth prototype was built to test them. By 1983, Northrop was involved in a number of simultaneous negotiations for the F-20, and its prospects appeared positive.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April 1970, a B-52D {{assigned}} to the 28th Bomb Wing caught fire and crashed while landing at Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota; sliding {{to a halt and}} burning atop a 25,000 gallon fuel storage tank. Efforts by fire department personnel saved the 9 man crew and prevented a catastrophic explosion of the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2010 trial {{involving}} Continental Airlines {{over the}} crash of Flight 4590 established that from 1976 until Flight 4590 there had been 57 tyre failures involving Concordes during takeoffs, including a near-crash at Dulles Airport on 14 June 1979 involving Air France Flight 54 where a tyre blowout pierced the plane's <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> and damaged the port-side engine, electrical cables, {{with the loss of}} two of the craft's hydraulic systems.|$|E

50|$|Some {{modern combat}} {{aircraft}} use conformal <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> (CFTs) instead of or {{in addition to}} conventional external <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks.</b> CFTs produce less drag and do not take up external hardpoints; however, some versions can only be removed on the ground.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design and}} assembly of two constant-mass <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> {{to be used in}} autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> are part of a power supply designed to increase AUV endurance without limiting maneuverability. The <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> allow AUVs to burn liquid fuel while maintaining constant buoyancy, increasing vehicle endurance by a factor of four without sacrificing mission capabilities. The <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> take air and water as ballast in proper proportions to replace the consumed mass of fuel. Active solenoid valves, a fuel pump, and a water pump control the mass flow through the system. The thesis covers the design of the mass flow in the system, the computer modeling of that system, and the prototyping of two constant-mass <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks.</b> by Theresa Ann Saxton-Fox.

5|$|The AM-1Q was {{developed}} for electronic countermeasures (ECM) duties. The fuselage <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> was removed {{to make room for}} the ECM operator and his equipment in a windowless compartment. The aircraft carried several radio and radar receivers, transmitters and a signal analyzer. The operator could also drop bundles of chaff through a chute to block radar signals.|$|E
5|$|The Pakistan Air Force retaliated {{for these}} attacks by bombing Okha harbour scoring direct hits on {{fuelling}} facilities for missile boats, an ammunition dump, and the missile boats' jetty. The Indian Navy anticipated this attack {{and had already}} moved the missile boats to other locations to prevent any losses. However, {{the destruction of a}} special <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> prevented any further incursions until Operation Python, executed three days later.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured rear wheel steering and packaged the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E

5|$|The {{launch of}} Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This {{was the first}} launch delay in the Apollo program due to a {{technical}} problem. During the delay, the space suits, a spacecraft separation mechanism and batteries in the Lunar Module (LM) were modified and tested. There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the Command Module (CM) would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in Young's space suit and fluctuations in {{the capacity of the}} Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting. In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a routine test. The rocket was returned to the Vertical Assembly Building (VAB) and the <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> replaced, and the rocket returned to the launch pad in February in time for the scheduled launch.|$|E
5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) {{launch vehicle}} was {{planned to be}} implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external <b>fuel</b> <b>tank,</b> and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{supplied}} by a separate 1,074 litre (276 US Gallon, 230 Imperial Gallon) <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> using dual booster pumps. Optional {{fourth and fifth}} tanks {{can be added to}} act as a reservoir supply, topping up the main tanks during flight, increasing range or endurance. The AW101 can also be outfitted with a probe for aerial refuelling. Self-sealing fuel tanks are an optional item to be selected by the customer. An inlet particle separator system can be installed, protecting the engine when operating in sandy environments.|$|E

50|$|The ZSU-57-2 {{uses the}} same engine as the T-54. It is a {{water-cooled}} V-54 4-stroke diesel V12 engine with a displacement of 38.88 litres, which develops 520 hp (388 kW) at 2,000 rpm. The engine itself weighs 895 kg. Fuel capacity is 830 litres carried in three <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> inside the hull (640 l total) and two external <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> on the right fender each of 95 l; fuel capacity was increased {{in comparison with the}} T-54. External rear-mounted supplemental <b>fuel</b> <b>tanks</b> can increase the road range to 595 km.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, Air Combat Command {{requested}} {{the testing of}} a 600-gallon external <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> which would extend the A-10's loitering time by 45–60 minutes; flight testing of such a tank had been conducted in 1997, but did not involve combat evaluation. Over 30 flight tests were conducted by the 40th Flight Test Squadron to gather data on the aircraft's handling characteristics and performance across different load configurations. It was reported that the tank slightly reduced stability in the yaw axis, {{but there was no}} decrease in aircraft tracking performance.|$|E
5|$|It was {{powered by}} a 128-horsepower (95kW) White 160AX 386cubic inch (6,300cc) 6-cylinder {{gasoline}} engine. It had a compression ratio of 6.3:1 and a 60US gallon (230l) <b>fuel</b> <b>tank.</b> It could reach {{a top speed of}} 41.7mph (67.1km/h) and a range of 175miles (282km) and a power to weight ratio of 15.8 horsepower per tonne. It had a main armament of four 0.5in (12.7mm) machine guns in a M45 Quadmount and 12millimeters of armor on the front and the sides.|$|E
5|$|Its major {{components}} were a spaceplane orbiter with an external <b>fuel</b> <b>tank</b> and two solid-fuel launch rockets at its side. The external tank, which {{was bigger than}} the spacecraft itself, was the only major component that was not reused. The shuttle could orbit in altitudes of 185–643km (115–400 miles) and carry a maximum payload (to low orbit) of 24,400kg (54,000lb). Missions could last from 5 to 17 days and crews could be from 2 to 8 astronauts.|$|E
