She did what she needed to do to survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E

Speeding to his workplace with the police in pursuit, Prescott removes the bracelet and leaves it in a filing cabinet. The device explodes as he is returning to the ground floor in a lift: the top levels of the Hudson Building are incinerated, and Prescott is plunged {{to the bottom of the}} lift shaft, ten storeys underground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} to {{identify}} the relationship among small-medium sized hospitals nurse's career plateau, self-efficacy, job embeddedness and turnover <b>intention.</b> The study <b>was</b> conducted through a survey on 217 nurses in five small-medium sized hospitals in J city. The data were collected from August 5, 2013 to August 20, 2013. The data were analyzed by SPSS/WIN 18. 0 program. The mean score of turnover <b>intention</b> <b>was</b> 3. 07. The positive correlations between career plateau and turnover <b>intention</b> <b>were</b> found, but the negative correlation between self-efficacy, job embeddedness and turnover <b>intention</b> <b>were</b> found.

5|$|German philosopher Jürgen Habermas has {{proposed}} a theory of discourse ethics that he claims is a descendant of Kantian ethics. He proposes that action {{should be based on}} communication between those involved, in which their interests and <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> discussed so they can be understood by all. Rejecting any form of coercion or manipulation, Habermas believes that agreement between the parties is crucial for a moral decision to be reached. Like Kantian ethics, discourse ethics is a cognitive ethical theory, in that it supposes that truth and falsity can be attributed to ethical propositions. It also formulates a rule by which ethical actions can be determined and proposes that ethical actions should be universalisable, in a similar way to Kant's ethics.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{contracted}} {{by fellow}} demon hunter Lady, Dante {{has come to}} stop Sanctus’ plan. And with his longtime partner Trish undercover in the Order as the mysterious Gloria, they help lead Nero to discover the truth himself, whereupon he forges a mysterious connection to Yamato, which chooses to aid him in battle. Following a final confrontation against Dante, Dante ultimately decides that Nero's <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> good, and he allows Nero to keep Yamato for the time being; finally sealing their alliance. Using his newfound power {{in the wake of}} Credo’s betrayal, Nero is able to help Credo turn against The Order after Sanctus successfully captures himself and Kyrie to use as leverage. Though Credo eventually gives his life in a vain attempt to set things right, Dante and Trish promise him that they will save Kyrie and Nero.|$|E

Pete and Liz follow Paul {{to a bar}} and find out {{that he is a}} Jenna Maroney impersonator, performing as her in a drag show. The next day, Liz asks Jenna if she knows what Paul does, but Jenna is aware of his work, having met Paul at a Jenna Maroney impersonator contest in which he won and Jenna herself placed fourth. Liz does not approve of the relationship and confronts Paul, asking what his <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> with Jenna. Paul tells her that he is not using Jenna to further his career, but that he is with her because she accepts him for who he is. Liz is convinced by their touching (although weird) display of care for each other, ultimately approving of their relationship.|$|E

Its {{collection}} has an emphasis on folk art and modern art and it hosts a popular blues and jazz concert series. The Erie Art Museum also works on public art projects {{in an effort to}} revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, the Erie Art Museum created a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade. 95 fiberglass fish were decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid $3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's Scholarship Fund and the Erie Public Art Endowment Fund. The Erie Art Museum created a similar public art project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish. In 2012, the Erie Art Museum began a project to create forty artistic and functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists. The museum's <b>intentions</b> <b>are</b> to add color and interest to downtown Erie and to promote bicycling, encouraging healthy lifestyles and environmental awareness.|$|E

25|$|The health action process {{approach}} (HAPA) {{is designed}} as a sequence of two continuous self-regulatory processes, a goal-setting phase (motivation) and a goal-pursuit phase (volition).

This is the motivational phase of the model.
