40|$|Audiometry was {{undertaken}} before and within {{half an hour}} following a heavy metal concert to assess evidence of noise damage. Of the four members tested, one member wore an <b>ear</b> <b>defender</b> in his right ear {{during the period of}} noise exposure. All unprotected ears showed a temporary threshold shift which was maximum in the lower frequencies. There was some evidence that early noise damage had occurred with a dip at 6 kHz. The role of music as noise and its potential to damage the cochlea are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} voice communications in the cockpit noise environment of modern `fast-jet' aircraft and helicopters, and in particular, describes research undertaken {{in support of the}} development of a system for reducing the noise level at the operators' ear by acoustic cancellation within the <b>ear</b> <b>defender,</b> known as Active Noise Reduction or ANR. The internal noise spectra of today's high performance `fast-jet' aircraft and military helicopters is described, and the complex interaction of acoustic noise transmission, speech, and microphone noise pick-up, which produces the total acoustic environment at the aircrews' ears, is discussed. Means of mathematically modelling the audio channel, quantifying the components identified above, and identifying areas of shortfall in performance are derived, leading to a procedure for the development of attenuation requirements, described as the communications audit. A model of the electroacoustic characteristics of the ANR <b>ear</b> <b>defender</b> assembly is presented and the sound field distribution within the ear defender/ear cavity, and its effect upon cancellation performance, is discussed. The extensive laboratory and flight testing of the ANR system that has been undertaken is reviewed, paying particular attention to the measurement and analysis techniques employed in such testing. Finally, the performance characteristics of ANR are discussed and compared with the requirements previously established. Design limitations placed upon the system by the constraints of its area of application are described, and the scope for future improvements is considered...|$|E

40|$|Disturbing {{noise is}} a growing problem in the society. Also in the home {{environment}} noise making devices exist, for example the vacuum cleaner. A simple way to decrease the annoyance from a vacuum cleaner is to use personal passive <b>ear</b> <b>defenders.</b> A problem with passive <b>ear</b> <b>defenders</b> is that they also attenuate wanted signals, such as speech or music. In this thesis a pair of prototype active <b>ear</b> <b>defenders</b> for vacuum cleaner noise attenuation have been developed and evaluated. Active noise control technology was used, which solved the problem with wanted signal attenuation. A measured noise reference was used {{with a pair of}} open earphones as actuator. The overall cancellation performance of the prototype system was quite low for vacuum cleaner noise. Due to that the coherence between the measured noise reference and the unwanted noise was low. Wanted signals were shown to be just slightly affected by the prototype system. ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Ear</b> <b>defenders</b> and <b>ear</b> plugs {{attenuate}} {{noise to}} levels that cause {{little or no}} damage to the user's hearing. Non-electric chainsaws are very loud, typically 115 dB, above the recommended exposure limit of 85dB from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.|$|R
50|$|Schuberth {{produces}} helmets for {{a variety}} of industrial purposes, including ballistic protection for soldiers, protection for firefighters and construction workers, producing full face helmets and head protection.

50|$|<b>Ear</b> <b>defenders</b> {{protect the}} wearer from extreme noises. The {{head-band}} and outer covering is usually {{made from a}} hard thermoplastic or metal. The protection usually comes from acoustic foam - this absorbs sound waves by increasing air resistance, thus reducing the amplitude of the waves. The energy is transformed into heat.|$|R

Her trials were conducted initially in British coastal waters, where the sonar operators found that their new equipment was very loud and required the use of <b>ear</b> <b>defenders.</b>|$|R
50|$|There is {{some debate}} {{on whether to}} {{consider}} protective gear items as tools, {{because they do not}} directly help perform work, just protect the worker like ordinary clothing. They do meet the general definition of tools and in many cases are necessary for the completion of the work. Personal protective equipment includes such items as gloves, safety glasses, <b>ear</b> <b>defenders</b> and biohazard suits.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>ear</b> <b>defenders</b> employ active sound protection, {{in which}} a {{microphone}} mounted in the headset picks up ambient sounds and transmits them through a dynamic range compression circuit to earphones inside. By virtue of the dynamic compression, the headset can be adjusted to allow the wearer to hear sounds at ordinary volumes normally, while attenuating louder sounds. Similar active earplugs also exist, primarily aimed at musicians.|$|R
50|$|Acoustic {{earmuffs}}, {{also known}} as ear defenders: cups lined with sound-deadening material, like thermal earmuffs and headphones in appearance, which are worn as hearing protection. These may be carried on a head-band or clipped onto the sides of a hard hat, for use on construction sites. Some manufacturers combine headphones with <b>ear</b> <b>defenders,</b> allowing the wearer to listen to music, communication or other audio source and also enjoy protection or isolation from ambient noise. For extra sound attenuation, earplugs {{can also be used}} in conjunction with earmuffs.|$|R

In the United States noise limits at work are set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).|$|R
40|$|Tests {{have been}} carried out on the Arc Air Gouging Process to assess the {{effectiveness}} of exhaust ventilation systems and protective equipment against fume and noise. The measures are described in some detail. The results show that adequate protection can be achieved by making use of an exhaust booth with a face velocity of 300 fpm. Investigation into the efficiency of an air fed welding visor showed that it reduced exposure to par-ticulate fume by about 80 per cent and could thus find use in workshops and semi-confined spaces (coupled with local exhaust ventilation). Measurements of the noise generated confirmed the existence of a serious hazard to hearing but the use of certain <b>ear</b> <b>defenders</b> can provide the necessary protection...|$|R
5000|$|In August 1963 {{during a}} hot run test {{on the first}} reactor, which had not then been loaded with nuclear fuel, {{problems}} were encountered due to noise from the single stage axial flow gas circulators. This could be heard up to five miles away, and personnel working at the station had to wear <b>ear</b> <b>defenders.</b> After unexplained drops in the mass flow rate and motor driving current in number 3 and 5 gas circulators, the hot run tests were stopped and the gas circuit opened up. Severe mechanical damage to the blading and diffuser sections of the number 3 and 5 gas circulators was observed. Large sections of the diffusers had broken away, and extensive fatigue cracking {{was found in the}} outer tapering shell and central axial cone. Large pieces of the diffuser casing had entered the gas circulator blades and caused heavy impact damage, and large amounts of debris had been transported down the gas duct. The Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs), which were provided to enable the performance of individual gas circulators to be [...] "trimmed," [...] were found to be extensively damaged, and the rotor blades and outlet guide vanes also had extensive impact and fatigue damage. Large numbers of the nuts and bolts involved had been shaken loose.|$|R
40|$|The {{harmful effects}} of {{aircraft}} noise, with respect to both comfort and occupational health, have long since been recognised, with many examples of sound control now implemented in commercial aircraft. However, the single engine light aircraft cabin is still an extremely noisy environment, which apparently has been side-lined by both cost and weight constraints, especially with respect to low frequency sound reduction. Consequently, pilots and passengers of these aircraft are still exposed to potentially damaging noise levels and hearing damage can only be avoided by {{the proper use of}} <b>ear</b> <b>defenders.</b> Minimisation of the noise around the occupants of the aircraft reduces the dependency of personal <b>ear</b> <b>defenders</b> and is conducive to a more comfortable, hygienic and less stressful environment. This thesis describes the basis of a theoretical and experimental project, directed at the design and evaluation of a practical active noise control (ANC) system suitable for a single engine light aircraft. Results from initial experiments conducted in a single engine aircraft demonstrated the viability of ANC for this application. However, the extreme noise, the highly damped cabin, the multiple tone excitation, the severe weight limitations and the requirement of air worthiness certification severely complicated the problem of achieving noise reduction throughout the entire aircraft cabin. Compromising the objective to only achieving local control around the occupants still presented difficulties because the region of attenuated noise around the error sensors was so small that a nearby observer experienced no sound level reduction whatsoever. The objective was therefore to move the control zone away from the error sensor and place a broad envelope of noise reduction immediately around the occupant's head, through the use of virtual sensors, thus creating the perception of global noise control. While virtual sensors are not new (Garcia-Bonito et al. (1996)), they are currently limited to acoustic pressure estimation (virtual microphones) via the initial measurement of an observer / sensor transfer function. In this research, new virtual sensor algorithms have been developed to: 1. minimise the sound level at the observer location, 2. broaden the control region, 3. adapt to any physical system changes and 4. produce a control zone that may ultimately follow an observer's head The performance of the virtual sensors were evaluated both analytically and experimentally in progressively more complex environments to identify their capabilities and limitations. It was found that the use of virtual sensors would, in general, attenuate the noise at the observer location more effectively than when using conventional remotely placed error sensors. Such a control strategy was considered to be ideal for a light single engine aircraft, because it would only require small light speakers (possibly fitted into a head-rest) to achieve a broad control zone that envelopes the region around the occupants heads.
