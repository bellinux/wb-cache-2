Section 304 appropriated such money as may be needed to carry out the Coinage Act.|$|E
5|$|The dam and reservoir, {{along with}} other {{treatment}} structures built at and below the mine, have successfully reduced the dry weather pollution of Spring Creek by up to ninety-five percent. Problems, though, still occur mainly {{in the form of}} large uncontrolled spills from the reservoir. Several concerns about the structural integrity and safety of the dam, both physically and biologically, arose in the 1990s. Emergency releases from Shasta Lake, often in the value of thousands of acre feet of water, have occurred <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> dilute massive acid spills from the Spring Creek drainage.|$|E

5|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that by the}} terms and spirit of the statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator.

It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act, and <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands, and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed. Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E

The new structure is of brick, handsomely trimmed in stone, and rises to the height of four stories, with about seventy or eighty feet of frontage on Harvard street. Two large stores claim a part of the ground floor, but they do not encroach on the broad and handsome entrance to the club's apartments.|$|E

The soldiers' continued disrespect for formalities and discipline is a source of frustration for some of the officers. After all, they are all there just to get the job done. Official propaganda, both their own and that of the enemy, is a source of amusement or an outright offense to them.

25|$|Miles of Plancy {{was briefly}} bailli or regent during Baldwin IV's minority. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Count Raymond III of Tripoli, Amalric's first cousin, became regent. It is highly {{probable}} that Raymond or his supporters engineered the assassination. Baldwin reached his majority in 1176, and despite his illness {{he no longer had}} any legal need for a regent. Since Raymond was his nearest relative in the male line with a strong claim to the throne, there was concern about the extent of his ambitions, although he had no direct heirs of his own. To balance this, the king turned <b>from</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> his uncle, Joscelin III of Edessa, who was appointed seneschal in 1176; Joscelin was more closely related to Baldwin than Raymond was, but had no claim to the throne himself.|$|E

The Leader of the House is an MP appointed by the Prime Minister to arrange government business and the legislative programme of Parliament, while the unofficial Leader of the Opposition is the MP who leads the largest opposition party able and prepared to assume office if the Government resigns. However, in September 2011, Low Thia Khiang, the Secretary-General of the Workers' Party of Singapore, which holds the most opposition seats in Parliament, {{said that he would}} not be accepting the title.
