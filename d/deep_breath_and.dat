500|$|Ahead of {{the fourth}} series, Russell T Davies {{acknowledged}} that the character of Gwen can be both loved and hated by the audience. He stated that as an actress Myles isn't preoccupied with her character being presented in a sympathetic light, being able [...] "to take that extraordinary <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> not care". io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the TV episode [...] "The Categories of Life", written by Jane Espenson, exposed the character's [...] "human vanity" [...] by showing that she has [...] "started to believe her own hype". In Anders' eyes, the character is responsible for her father's second heart attack because of her rash actions. Anders felt that later episodes in the fourth series continued to illuminate flaws in Gwen's character, describing her as someone with an [...] "addictive personality" [...] who [...] "treats her Torchwood adventures like a drug that she craves" [...] though she knows they [...] "ruin her relationships {{with her husband and}} child".|$|E

2500|$|George Will {{suggested}} that America could use bin Laden's death to [...] "draw a <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>and</b> some pertinent conclusions", among them that [...] "bin Laden was {{brought down by}} intelligence gathering that more resembles excellent police work than a military operation." [...] He added, [...] "There remains much more to al-Qaeda than bin Laden, {{and there are many}} more tentacles to the terrorism threat than al-Qaeda and its affiliates. So 'the long war' must go on. But perhaps such language is bewitching our minds, because this is not essentially war." ...|$|E
2500|$|The jazz {{pianist and}} {{educator}} Kenny Barron commented, [...] "I have every record [...] ever made—and I try never {{to listen to}} them ... If I did, I'd throw up my hands and give up!" [...] Jean Cocteau dubbed Tatum [...] "a crazed Chopin". Count Basie called him the eighth wonder of the world. [...] Dave Brubeck observed, [...] "I don't think there's any more chance of another Tatum turning up than another Mozart." [...] Pianist Mulgrew Miller, commented on personal growth by saying, [...] "When I talk to the people I admire, they're always talking about continuous growth and development and I look at them and say, 'Well... what are YOU going to do?' But, as Harold Mabern says, 'There's always Art Tatum records around'". Dizzy Gillespie said, [...] "First you speak of Art Tatum, then take a long <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> <b>and</b> you speak of the other pianists." ...|$|E

40|$|In awake rats {{a single}} {{recurrent}} larger tidal volume (<b>deep</b> <b>breaths)</b> occurs at regular intervals, followed by oscillations in arterial pressure and heart rate. In {{the present study}} we recorded the changes in blood pressure, heart rate and ventilation during the wakefulness-sleep cycle identified by electrocorticographic records {{in order to determine}} whether the <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> cardiovascular oscillations were associated with changes in the electrocorticogram. During several episodes of slow-wave sleep (SWS) in 7 rats the <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> oscillations in arterial pressure and heart rate were preceded by SWS desynchronization. The interval between <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> during SWS was 71 ± 4 s, the period between initial desynchronization and the generation of <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> was 3. 98 ± 0. 45 s and the duration of SWS desynchronization was 11 ± 0. 65 s. Hypotension (- 16 ± 1 mmHg) and tachycardia (+ 15 ± 5 bpm) were observed during <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> in the SWS state. These data indicate that the oscillations in arterial pressure and heart rate during SWS are associated with <b>deep</b> <b>breaths,</b> which in turn are preceded by desynchronization of the electrocorticogram in this state of slee...|$|R

50|$|Rest-pause (post-failure): After {{a normal}} set of 6-8 reps (to failure), the weight is re-racked and the trainer takes 10-15 <b>deep</b> <b>breaths,</b> <b>and</b> then {{performs}} one more repetition.

The twenty-rep squat is another, similar approach, in that it follows a 12-15 rep set of squats with individual rest-pause reps, up {{to a total of}} 20 reps.|$|R

50|$|If {{bilateral}} fine crackles {{are present}} throughout the inspiratory time and are persisting after several <b>deep</b> <b>breaths,</b> <b>and</b> if remaining present {{on several occasions}} several weeks apart in a subject aged ≥60 years, this should raise the suspicion of IPF and lead to consideration of an HRCT scan of the chest which is more sensitive than a chest X-ray. As crackles are not specific for IPF, they must prompt a thorough diagnostic process.|$|R

25|$|There may be {{a number}} of side effects {{following}} the surgery. Because certain nerve connections to the lungs are cut during the procedure, transplant recipients cannot feel the urge to cough or feel when their new lungs are becoming congested. They must therefore make conscious efforts to take <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> <b>and</b> cough in order to clear secretions from the lungs. Their heart rate responds less quickly to exertion due to the cutting of the vagus nerve that would normally help regulate it. They may also notice a change in their voice due to potential damage to the nerves that coordinate the vocal cords.|$|R

Show runner David Simon recalls that Colesberry wanted Mann to direct a third season episode but Colesberrys untimely death left the other producers reeling and they felt unable to risk a directorial debut in their first season without him.
