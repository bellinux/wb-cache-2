40|$|While many {{experimental}} {{studies have been}} done on siliceous and metamorphic rocks for both use-wear and post depositional surface modification (PDSM) events, little is known about such experiments on volcanic materials (other than obsidian), and on basalt in particular. Here we present the preliminary results of several experiments related to: a) evidence for basalt use (e. g., butchery and <b>fresh</b> <b>hide</b> scraping) and the subsequent characteristic use-wear patterns that can be seen; and b) post-depositional surface modifications caused by bear (Ursidae) trampling on experimental basalt flakes and subsequent use of these flakes for a tumbling experiment in a special tumbling machine. The results of these experiments were compared to better understand some surface modifications noted on the Middle to Upper Pleistocene lithic assemblages of the Azokh Cave site (Nagorno Karabagh, Lesser Caucasus). Although some aspects of both events (use-wear and PDSM) remain to be studied in depth, the experiments have improved our understanding of the effects of use-wear and post-depositional trampling and tumbling on basalt lithic artefacts. In particular, it has allowed us to recognise mechanical alterations (e. g., cracks, striations, fractures, edge damage) caused by trampling and tumbling and to note differences between these modifications and those caused by use. In particular, the experiments have shown that macroscopic modifications are rarely diagnostic, especially those observed after use. Microscopic wear features such as edge rounding, polish, abrasion and striations were the most evident types of alteration on basalt flakes, although occurring at different times and from different types of use. Distribution and orientation of alterations may be key in distinguishing use-wear from post-depositional alterations on basalt artefacts. </p...|$|E

The appearance of inter and intra polypeptide chain links was investigated by comparing non-immunized and immunized hair using MIR and FIR spectroscopy, ICP chemical analysis and DSC. The chemical and the instrumental analyses indicate that the exposure of hair to divalent cations in alkaline medium, unlike the monovalent cations, induces the formation of cross-links in the keratin structure and promotes immunization. These investigations contribute to confirmation that the immunization process occurs only in the presence of divalent cations.

There are multiple interventions available for treating carcasses; however, this project was designed to evaluate an intervention capable of reducing bacterial counts on the hide prior to opening {{in order to minimize}} carcass contamination. In Trial I, <b>fresh</b> beef <b>hides</b> (n = 12) were cut into sections and assigned to serve as either clipped (hair trimmed) or non-clipped sections. Sections were inoculated with a bovine fecal slurry and sampled following a water wash. Treatments (distilled water, isopropyl alcohol, 3 % hydrogen peroxide, 2 % L-lactic acid, 1 % cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), and 10 % Povidone-iodine) then were applied to each section and sampled for aerobic plate counts (APCs), coliform, and Escherichia coli counts. Within clipped samples, 1 % CPC and 3 % hydrogen peroxide caused the greatest reductions in aerobic plate counts, and 1 % CPC, 2 % L-lactic acid, and 3 % hydrogen peroxide showed among the greatest reductions in coliform counts. In Trial II, beef carcasses with hides on were sampled initially and clipped, and then antimicrobials (2 % L-lactic acid, 3 % hydrogen peroxide, and 1 % CPC) were applied before sampling again for APC, coliform, and E. coli counts. This procedure was replicated in Trial II utilizing a non-pathogenic E. coli Type I indicator strain transformed to produce a green fluorescing protein (GFP). In Trial II, though few differences existed between antimicrobial treatments, all three (1 % CPC, 2 % L-lactic acid, and 3 % hydrogen peroxide) resulted in approximately a 2 -log 10 CFU/ 100 -cm 2 GFP reduction when applied to clipped hide surfaces in the brisket region of the carcass. In Trial III, 1 % CPC produced the greatest reduction on the hide surface for APCs. In Trial IV clipped beef hide sections were sampled initially and then antimicrobials (2 % L-lactic acid, 3 % hydrogen peroxide, and 1 % CPC) were applied before sampling again to determine reduction. Trial IV also involved the use of the E. coli GFP indicator strain.
