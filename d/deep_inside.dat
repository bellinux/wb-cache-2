Except {{for a single}} juvenile specimen recovered from the understory debris of old growth redwood forests of northwest California, none have been found outside the caves. This specimen has different markings than T. marchingtoni and may represent a new undescribed species.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of effective time-delay shells {{at the end}} of World War I made this scheme much less effective, as the intact shell would penetrate layers of weak armour and explode <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> the ship. In addition, she was grossly overweight compared to her original design, making her a wet ship with a highly stressed structure.|$|E
5|$|A {{neutrino}} detector {{was installed}} <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> the Mont Blanc Tunnel in the early‑1980s {{in order to}} take advantage of the shielding from background radiation provided by the 4,800meter water equivalent (m.w.e.) of solid rock surrounding it in every direction. In February 1987, the underground neutrino observatory reported the detection of a neutrino event, believed to have originated from the explosion of the SN 1987A supernova.|$|E

5|$|During final testing, {{engineers}} detected {{that the}} spacecraft's X band (NATO H/I/J bands) communications antenna was transmitting {{only a tiny}} fraction of the power that it should. Thermal imaging showed that the waveguide to the antenna, <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> the spacecraft, was very hot. Clearly that was where the missing power was being dissipated. The waveguide could not normally be inspected or repaired without major disassembly of the satellite, which would have required a return to the facilities in Europe and resulted in a major delay to the launch. To avoid doing this, a local surgeon was brought in to inspect the component with an endoscope. The surgeon, Tatiana Zykova, discovered that two pieces of ferrite were lodged in the tube, and was able to remove both of them. Engineers were able to assist the removal of the second one with a magnet. It was determined that the ferrite had come from an absorption load installed <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> the antenna, which was intended to improve its performance. Some ferrite (the remaining stump of this load) was removed from inside the base of the antenna in order to prevent any further debris falling into the waveguide.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to have been formed from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> the formation. Data from the mission has helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting that it is no more than about 4.25 billion years old.|$|E
5|$|Paul Oscar {{worked with}} easy-listening group Casino on their album Stereo (1998). He {{followed}} this with three albums: the English-language album <b>Deep</b> <b>Inside</b> (1999); and two collaborations with harpist Monika Abendroth, Ef ég sofna ekki (If I Won't Sleep Tonight, 2001) and Ljósin heima (The Lights at Home, 2003) (his sister Sigrún Hjálmtýsdóttir (Diddú) also {{appeared on the}} latter album). His musical range spans traditional Icelandic songs, ballads, love songs {{in the style of}} Burt Bacharach, disco, house and techno.|$|E

5|$|Seven minutes later, {{two other}} high-calibre shells struck the Bretagne {{at the same}} time. The first detonated {{at the base of}} the tripod mast, igniting some {{ready-to-use}} anti-aircraft projectiles which were stored in lockers next to the anti-aircraft mounts. The second went through the central 138 mm casement, exploding <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> the ship. A fire started, with leaking oil burning next to the ship. In about thirty seconds, the ship rolled and exploded.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately, Link restores the {{crystals}} {{to the six}} palaces, defeating a strong guardian within each one to do so, and enters the Great Palace. After venturing <b>deep</b> <b>inside,</b> Link must battle a flying creature known as Thunderbird, followed by a shadowy doppelgänger of himself known as Dark Link. Link then claims the Triforce of Courage and returns to Zelda. The three triangles unite into the collective Triforce, and Link's wish awakens Zelda. The game ends as they (presumably) kiss under a falling curtain.|$|E
5|$|Water {{is usually}} only found <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> holes {{at the bottom}} of {{blow-out}} craters. Animals therefore get the moisture they need directly from their food. The black soil on and around cinder cones does not hold moisture for long, making it difficult for plants to establish themselves. Soil particles first develop from direct rock decomposition by lichens and typically collect in crevices in lava flows. Successively more complex plants then colonize the microhabitat created by the increasingly productive soil.|$|E

A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the monster in Westminster Abbey, and Quatermass and troops of the British Army rush in to destroy it in the hour before it brings about doomsday. Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech was in possession of the ball, <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> Wake Forest territory. Shortly after the quarter began, Tech failed to gain a needed first down in order to continue its drive. Instead of attempting to convert the fourth down—Tech had attempted and failed on two fourth-down conversions in the third quarter—Tech instead sent in kicker Travis Bell. Bell's 34-yard attempt sailed through the goalposts, and with 12:53 remaining in the game, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead.|$|E
5|$|In the 85thminute, Scholes clipped {{the ball}} {{over the top of}} the Barcelona {{defensive}} line to Rooney, who chested the ball down for Tevez, only to be given offside. Scholes then found Rooney again on the left wing with a raking ball from <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> his own half, but Rooney's first touch was heavy, allowing Puyol to get back and put the ball out for a corner. Rooney took the corner short to Tevez, whose cross was just beyond the reach of Berbatov and diverted behind again by Puyol. Rooney also took the second corner, which was met by Berbatov, but he put the ball high over the crossbar.|$|E

5|$|M. inquilina is {{only found}} in the {{south-west}} of Western Australia, with the holotype collected 225 kilometres (140 miles) from Perth. M. inquilina occurs in colonies with M. vindex and M. nigriceps, found in soil, under logs and flat rocks in woodland. They are commonly found in granite outcrops and wooded areas, with trees such as Corymbia calophylla, Acacia acuminata and a large unidentified species of Allocasuarina (possibly Allocasuarina huegeliana) present. The type locality was in an area cleared for agricultural purposes, but some areas were still wooded; many fallen large trees were present. M. inquilina is typically found <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> the nests, around 25 centimetres (10 inches) {{and can be found}} next to the queen.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs {{are active}} {{primarily}} {{during the day}} (diurnal), during which time they feed primarily on fruits and nectar, often adopting suspensory postures while feeding. The seeds of the fruit they eat pass through their digestive tract and are propagated throughout the rainforests in their feces, helping to ensure new plant growth and a healthy forest ecosystem. These lemurs are also significant pollinators of the traveller's tree (Ravenala madagascariensis). Without destroying the inflorescence, they lick the nectar from <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> the flower using their long muzzles and tongues, collecting and transferring pollen on their snouts and fur from plant to plant. This relationship {{is thought to be}} a result of co-evolution.|$|E
5|$|Scully accompanies Skinner as he {{is being}} transported in an ambulance. When Cardinal {{attempts}} to break in, she tracks him down and arrests him. Cardinal tells her that Krycek is headed to an abandoned missile silo in Black Crow, North Dakota. There, the agents are captured by the Smoking Man's men and are escorted away. <b>Deep</b> <b>inside,</b> Krycek sits atop the UFO and coughs out the black oil, which seeps into the ship. Skinner recovers and returns to work. Mulder sees Scully at Melissa's grave, explaining that Cardinal {{was found dead in}} his cell. Meanwhile, Krycek is trapped within the silo, banging on the door in an attempt to be let out.|$|E
40|$|In {{non-ferrous}} metallurgy the {{refractory life}} is application dependent, typically going from several months up to 2 years or more. Slag engineering {{is widely used}} to reduce the dissolution rate of a refractory lining by forming a solid protection layer at the slag-lining interface, thereby increasing the lining's lifetime. The non-ferrous slag in this paper is engineered to form a protective spinel layer. This phase, however, only forms near and at the slag-lining interface, while <b>deeper</b> <b>inside</b> the sample forsterite grains are detected, resulting in direct contact between the still unsaturated slag and the magnesia-chromite refractory phases. At this position the MgO dissolution increases with a factor 3 – 4 compared with the slag-refractory interface, attacking the bonding between grains and decreasing the brick's mechanical strength. As this happens <b>deeper</b> <b>inside</b> the sample, the spalling risk increases. Strategies to simultaneously reduce refractory dissolution and spalling are discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The Badami cave temples are {{carved out}} of soft Badami {{sandstone}} on a hill cliff. The plan {{of each of the}} four caves (1 to 4) includes an entrance with a verandah (mukha mandapa) supported by stone columns and brackets, a distinctive feature of these caves, leading to a columned mandapa, or main hall (also maha mandapa), and then to the small, square shrine (sanctum sanctorum, garbha ghriya) cut <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> the cave. The cave temples are linked by a stepped path with intermediate terraces overlooking the town and lake. The cave temples are labelled 1–4 in their ascending series; this numbering does not reflect the sequence of excavation.|$|E
5|$|After the Kansas kickoff, Virginia Tech {{took over}} at its 33-yard line. Needing a score, the Hokies {{committed}} a five-yard false start penalty before quarterback Sean Glennon was sacked by Kansas' Mike Rivera. The two plays pushed the Virginia Tech offense back, {{preventing them from}} gaining a first down. Forced to punt the ball away, Virginia Tech had to play defense as Kansas took over at its 28-yard line. Secure in their lead, Kansas elected to run the ball {{in an effort to}} keep the clock moving and bring the game to an end more quickly. Brandon McAnderson broke free for 28yards on the first play of the drive, and Jake Sharp contributed another first down on the ground before the Hokie defense stopped Kansas on an attempt to earn a first down on a fourth-and-two <b>deep</b> <b>inside</b> Virginia Tech territory.|$|E
5|$|After the {{ceremonial}} pre-game coin toss, California chose {{to receive the}} ball to begin the game. James Bethea returned the opening kickoff to the California 21-yard line. On the game's first play from scrimmage, California quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Burl Toler, presaging the game's offensive nature. Rodgers completed another pass, and the Bears were aided by a penalty against Virginia Tech. Running back Adimchinobe Echemandu ran the ball twice for short gains each time, and Rodgers continued to make long passes for first downs to keep the Golden Bears' offensive drive going. <b>Deep</b> <b>inside</b> Virginia Tech territory, Rodgers ran the ball twice, picking up short gains and the game's first touchdown. The extra point kick by kicker Tyler Fredrickson was good, and with 9:43 remaining in the quarter, California took a 7–0 lead.|$|E
