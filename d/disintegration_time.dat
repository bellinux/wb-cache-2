50|$|The first ODT {{form of a}} drug to get {{approval}} from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was a Zydis ODT formation of Claritin (loratadine) in December 1996.

The regulatory condition for meeting the definition of an orally disintegrating tablet is USP method 701 for Disintegration. FDA guidance issued in Dec 2008 is that ODT drugs should disintegrate in less than 30 seconds. This practice is under review by the FDA as the fast <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> of ODTs makes the disintegration test too rigorous for some of the ODT formulations that are commercially available.|$|E
50|$|Tablets {{designed}} to dissolve on the buccal (cheek) mucous membrane were {{a precursor to}} the ODT. This dosage form was intended for drugs that yield low bioavailability through the digestive tract but are inconvenient to administer parenterally, such as steroids and narcotic analgesics. Absorption through the cheek allows the drug to bypass the digestive tract for rapid systemic distribution. Not all ODTs have buccal absorption and many have similar absorption and bioavailability to standard oral dosage forms with the primary route remaining GI absorption. However, a fast <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> and a small tablet weight can enhance absorption in the buccal area. The first ODTs disintegrated through effervescence rather than dissolution, and were {{designed to}} make taking vitamins more pleasant for children. This method was adapted to pharmaceutical use with the invention of microparticles containing a drug, which would be released upon effervescence of the tablet and swallowed by the patient. Dissolution became more effective than effervescence through improved manufacturing processes and ingredients (such as the addition of mannitol to increase binding and decrease dissolution time). Catalent Pharma Solutions (formerly Scherer DDS) in the U.K., Cima Labs and Fuisz Technologies (whose founder Richard Fuisz went on to pioneer orally soluble films, a separate but related dosage form) in the U.S. and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company in Japan led the development of ODTs.|$|E

40|$|Fast-disintegration {{technologies}} have encountered increased interest from {{industries in the}} past decades. In order to orientate the formulators to {{the choice of the}} best disintegrating agent, the most common disintegrants were selected and their ability to quickly disintegrants compressed tablets was evaluated. For this study, a central composite design was used. The main factors included were the concentration of disintegrant (X- 1) and the compression force (X- 2). These factors were studied for tablets containing either Zeparox((R)) or Pearlitol 200 ((R)) as soluble diluents and six LH 11 and LH 31, different disintegrants: L-HPC(R) LH 11 and LH 31, Lycatab PGS((R)), Vivasol((R)), Kollidon CL(R), and Explotab((R)). Their micromeritics properties were previously determined. The response variables were <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> (Y- 1), tensile strength (Y- 2) and porosity (Y- 3). Whatever the diluent, the longest <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> is obtained with Vivasol((R)) as the disintegrant, while Kollidon CL(R) leads to the shortest disintegration times. Exception for Lycatab PGS((R)) and L-HPC LH 11 ((R)), formulations with Pearlitol 200 ((R)) disintegrate faster. Almost the same results are obtained with porosity: no relevant effect of disintegrant concentration is observed, since porosity is mainly correlated to the compression force. In particular, highest values are obtained with Zeparox((R)) as the diluent when compared to Pearlitol 2000 and, as the type of disintegrant is concerned, no difference is observed. Tensile strength models have been all statistically validated and are all highly dependent on the compression force. Lycatab PGS((R)) concentration does not affect <b>disintegration</b> <b>time,</b> mainly increased by the increase of compression pressure. When Pearlitol 2000 is used with Vivasol((R)), <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> is more influenced by the disintegrant concentration than by the compression pressure, an increase in concentration leading to a significant and relevant increase of the <b>disintegration</b> <b>time.</b> With Zeparox((R)), the interaction between the two controlled variables is more complex: there is no effect of compression force on the <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> for a small amount of disintegrant. but a significant increase for higher concentrations. With Kollidon CL(R), the main factor influencing the <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> is the compression force. rather than the disintegrant concentration. Increasing both the compression force and the disintegrant concentration leads to an increase of the <b>disintegration</b> <b>time.</b> For lower Kollidon CL(R) percentages, the compression pressure increases dramatically the tablet disintegration. With the Explotab((R)), whatever the increase of compression force, the disintegrant concentration leads to an increase of the <b>disintegration</b> <b>time.</b> According to Student's t-test, only the compression force significantly and strongly influences the <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> when Pearlitol 200 ((R)) is used. A slight interaction and some trends nevertheless appear: above 150 MPa, increasing the disintegrant concentration leads to a shortened <b>disintegration</b> <b>time,</b> below this limit the opposite effect is observed...|$|E

Additional bioassays were performed to investigate Scenedesmus colony disintegration under different light regimes. In the mesocosm experiment, colony formation took place rapidly, but relaxation towards the initial size took relatively long (> 10 d) after cessation of herbivory. In the bioassays, in the absence of infochemicals, colonies disintegrated almost immediately in the dark (1 - 1. 5 d), within 4 d under a photoperiod of 16 : 8 (L:D) and between 8 and 12 days under full light.

Formulated orodispersible tablets were evaluated for weight variation, friability, <b>disintegration</b> <b>time,</b> drug content, wetting time, water absorption ratio and in vitro drug release. Results: The results show that the presence of a superdisintegrant and mannitol is desirable for orodispersion. All the formulations satisfied the limits of orodispersion with a dispersion time of less than 60 sec. For example, formulation F 4 showed a <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> of 32. 1 sec, crushing strength of 4. 93 kg/cm 2, drug content of 98. 5 % and fast drug release rate of 99. 5 % within 30 min, as compared with the conventional tablet (49. 5 %). Conclusion: It is feasible to formulate orodispersible tablets of meloxican with acceptable <b>disintegration</b> <b>time,</b> rapid drug release and good hardness, which could be amenable to replication on an industrial scale...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to mask the taste of {{cetirizine}} HCl and to incorporate the granules produced in oral disintegrating tablets (ODT). The bitter, active substance was coated by fluidized bed coating using Eudragit® RL 30 -D at levels between 15 % and 40 % w/w. The ODTs were developed by varying the ratio of superdisintegrants such as sodium croscarmellose, crospovidone grades and low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose (L-HPC). A direct compression process was used to compress the ODTs under various compaction forces to optimize tablet robustness. The properties of the compressed tablets including porosity, hardness, friability and dissolution profiles were further investigated. The in vitro and in vivo evaluation of the tablet <b>disintegration</b> <b>times</b> showed almost identical rapid disintegration below 10  s at the optimal levels of each superdisintegrant. Finally, the taste and sensory evaluation in human volunteers demonstrated excellence in masking the bitter active and tablet palatability...|$|R

Methods: Simvastatin solid dispersions in β- cyclodextrin, hydroxylpropyl-β-cyclodextrin, and hydroxylbutyl-β-cyclodextrin were prepared in different drug: polymer ratios by kneading and solvent evaporation methods. Compatibility was investigated by Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) Based {{on the results}} of solubility studies, the most suitable solid dispersion was selected and formulated into orodispersible tablets using Emcosoy and K-polacrillin as superdisintegrants, and mannitol and Pullulan as diluents. The tablets were evaluated for wetting and <b>disintegration</b> <b>times,</b> water absorption, and in vtro dissolution. Results: Increase in drug solubility was dependent on polymer type, concentration and preparation method. Simvastatin-hydroxylbutyl-β-cyclodextrin solid dispersion mixture prepared in 1 : 2 drug: polymer ratio by solvent evaporation method had a higher solubility than other dispersions. DSC and FTIR indicated the formation of solid dispersion without chemical interaction between simvastatin and polymer.

40|$|Purpose: A {{study was}} made of the binding {{properties}} of trifoliate yam starch, obtained from Dioscorea dumetorum (Pax), in chloroquine phosphate tablet formulations in comparison with official corn starch. Method: Compressional properties were analyzed using density measurements and compression equations of Heckel and Kawakita. The mechanical properties of the tablets were assessed using the crushing strength and friability of the tablets, while drug release properties of the tablets were assessed using <b>disintegration</b> and dissolution <b>times.</b> Results: Tablet formulations containing trifoliate yam starch exhibited faster onset and higher amount of plastic deformation during compression than those containing corn starch. The crushing strength, <b>disintegration</b> and dissolution <b>times</b> of the tablets increased with binder concentration while friability values decreased. Trifoliate yam starch produced tablets with stronger mechanical properties and longer <b>disintegration</b> and dissolution <b>times</b> than those containing corn starch. Conclusion: Trifoliate yam starch would be a better alternative to corn starch in producing uncoated tablets for which high bond strength is essential...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{the study of the}} {{properties}} of tablets from coprocessed dry binder StarLac. The properties under study included the tensile strength and <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> in dependence on compression force, addition of two lubricants (magnesii stearas, sodium stearylfumarate) in two concentrations (0, 4. 0, 8 %) and a 50 % addition of the active ingredient ascorbic acid. The compression forces were 15, 16, 17 kN, {{in the case of the}} tableting material with the active ingredient only 16 kN. The addition of magnesii stearas in a concentration of 0, 4 % increased the tensile strength, but in a concentration of 0, 8 % didn't. The same result is in the case of sodium stearyl fumarate for compression force 17 kN. The addition of lubricants increased the <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> of tablets, less in the case of Pruv. The addition of ascorbic acid decreased the tensile strength of tablets, the <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> was shorten. StarLac without and with magnesii stearas too offers the tablets with higher tensile strength and with shorter <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> then the physical mixture of Starch 1500 and Pharmatose DCL 15...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mucilage}} {{obtained from the}} ripe fruits of Hibiscus esculentus Linn. (Malvaceae) on the mechanical and disintegration properties of paracetamol tablets were investigated against gum acacia as a standard binding agent. The effects {{of the nature and}} concentration of the mucilage binder and the relative density of the tablet on the tensile strength, brittle fracture index and <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> of the tablets were investigated. Relative density, concentration and nature of binder had the greatest effects on tensile strength, brittle fracture index and <b>disintegration</b> <b>time,</b> respectively. Increasing, the concentration of mucilage from 2. 5 % to 10. 0 % w/w, and increasing relative density of the tablet from 0. 70 to 0. 80 led to an increase in tensile strength and <b>disintegration</b> <b>time,</b> but a decrease in brittle fracture index. Tablets formulated with H. esculentus mucilage had lower tensile strength and <b>disintegration</b> <b>time</b> values than those containing gum acacia, and exhibited less lamination and capping. The nature and concentration of binder had the highest interaction among the factors studied. In conclusion, Hibiscus esculentus mucilage could be useful as an alternative binding agent to gum acacia, especially where faster disintegration is required and lamination and capping are of concern...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Understanding {{the product}} and process {{variable}} on the final product performance {{is an essential part}} of the quality-by-design (QbD) principles in pharmaceutical development. The hard capsule is an established pharmaceutical dosage form used worldwide in development and manufacturing. The empty hard capsules are supplied as an excipient that is filled by pharmaceutical manufacturers with a variety of different formulations and products. To understand the potential variations of the empty hard capsules as an input parameter and its potential impact on the finished product quality, a study was performed investigating the critical quality parameters within and in between different batches of empty hard gelatin capsules. The variability of the hard capsules showed high consistency within the specification of the critical quality parameters. This also accounts for the <b>disintegration</b> <b>times,</b> when automatic endpoint detection was used. Based on these data, hard capsules can be considered as a suitable excipient for product development using QbD principles.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Fast {{disintegrating}} tablets of nifedipine {{prepared by}} superdisintegrant addition and sublimation methods were evaluated. Twelve batches of tablets were formulated by direct compression using varying concentrations of crospovidone and croscarmellose sodium. Camphor {{was incorporated into}} six of the batches. Their granules were evaluated for pre-compression and post-compression parameters. FTIR analysis of the drug and excipients was also carried out. Results obtained showed that their granules were free flowing with angle of repose < 26 ° and Carr’s index < 19 %. The tablets gave hardness of 3. 67 - 5. 99 kgf, friability of < 1 %, wetting and <b>disintegration</b> <b>times</b> of < 101 and < 91 secs, respectively. Dissolution profiles showed all the tablets released over 92 % of their drug within 30 mins. FTIR analysis demonstrated no interactions between nifedipine and excipients.

40|$|Hot-melt pan-coating, {{which is}} a novel coating method and takes 2 - 3 hours for 300 mg coating weight gain per capsule and {{tamper-resistant}} coating, which takes 30 minutes, is much faster than tedious sugar coating and allows greater coating weight gains in shorter times than spray-melt coating. Although hot-melt pan coating is promising, it needs modification for industrial scale-up and to provide more elegant formulations. Hot-melt capsule filling is an especially appealing and simple way to make sustained release formulations. A novel formulation of glipizide developed comprising compression of four-layer coated beads into tablets has advantages of keeping sustained-release characteristics following a lag time, providing approximately zero-order release, and releases drug nearly independent of paddle speeds 50 and 100 rpm. The amount of binding and disintegration ingredients can be adjusted to produce appropriate <b>disintegration</b> <b>times</b> for tablets and to release individually coated particulates.
