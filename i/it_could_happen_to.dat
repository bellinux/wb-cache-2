2500|$|Due to the {{conflicting}} personalities of his protagonist couple, Sparks faced difficulty {{in finding a}} vehicle that would draw Will and Ronnie to spend time together. “It had to be during the summer, she [...] had to be new in town, and whatever happened had to start in June and end in August. Because you always want a conclusion,” said Sparks of his requirements. He mentioned summer camp or a summer job as typical vehicles used in books, but dismissed them as unoriginal and boring. “So it’s got to be original, it’s got to be interesting, {{and at the same}} time it’s got to be universal, that you feel like <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> anybody.” Sparks eventually chose to have Will and Ronnie bond over a loggerhead sea turtle nest, knowing that Loggerhead eggs often hatch in August. The scene of the hatching nest took place during the first week of August and involved 26 live loggerhead sea turtle hatchlings. Sea turtle hatchlings have an innate sense to head toward the ocean water as soon as they are born, so scenes of the nest hatching had to be taken swiftly. Said Mike Dodd of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, the biologist who supervised the scene, the hatchlings [...] "did all they know how to do: They crawled down to the water and swam off." [...] Sparks told an interviewer he suspected filmmakers would digitally add more turtles to the scene. At the time of filming, the loggerhead sea turtle was listed as a threatened species. The environmentally friendly theme was an added bonus to Tybee Island, which was then promoting ecotourism.|$|E

Openly gay actor Hong Seok-cheon recalled that after he came out in 2000, he was fired from all his acting and hosting jobs, until Kim hired him in a supporting role in the 2003 drama Perfect Love.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} matters which took place recently was the Land Swop between Stewart's and South Dublin County Council. This was the subject of many years of consultation and negotiation between the two parties, with formal contracts being signed in June of this year. The result of the Swop allows Stewart's to have {{the best of both worlds}} as it were. In exchange for Stewart's land bordering the River Liffey - to which we retain access and which will now become a park under the supervision of South Dublin County Council - we have acquired approximately an additional 18. 5 acres in Balgaddy. This brings our total land holding in Balgaddy to approximately 27 acres. This exchange of land enables the Hospital to extend its training and other services to the community in due course, if it so wishes. I would like to mention that we are very grateful to Mr. Dan O'Sullivan, who though since retired, was the Deputy Manager of South Dublin County Council at the time of the exchange, for his tremendous understanding throughout the entire period. I think you are all aware of the plans for Educational, Sports and Community Services at Balgaddy. While all three aspects of the plan are important and inter-related the committee feel that the provision of a 50 metre pool is vital for the development of the plan as a whole. So far we have not succeeded in persuading Government Ministers to invest money in such a pool, but we are still hopeful that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>happen</b> and continue <b>to</b> make efforts with the new Government. If however by early next year the commitment of Government is not available, we will review our plans...|$|R
