During this period, Thaxter published an important Gymnosporangium paper, “On Certain Cultures of Gymnosporangium with Notes on their Roesteliae”, in which he <b>described</b> <b>relationships</b> between Gymnosporangium and Roestelia species. In 1888, Thaxter received the degrees of M.A. and Ph.D., with his thesis monographing “The Entomophthoreae of the United States”. From 1888 to 1891, he took a position as the first plant pathologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. He set up a third department in the Station and named it “Mycology”. During his brief time at the Station, his research led to valuable discoveries in Phytopathology. He described the pathogen of potato scab, Oospora scabies, the mildew of lima beans (Phytophthora phaseoli), the onion smut (Urocystis cepulae), and pioneered the use of fungicide sprays to control fungal diseases.|$|E

40|$|Multistage {{stochastic}} programs, {{which involve}} sequences of decisions over time, are usually hard to solve in realistically sized problems. Providing bounds for optimal solution may help in evaluating {{whether it is}} worth the additional computations for the stochastic program vs. simplified approaches. In this paper we generalize measures from the two-stage case, based on different levels of available information, to the multistage stochastic programming problems. A set of theorems providing chains of inequalities among the new quantities are proved. Numerical results on a case study related to a simple transportation problem illustrate the <b>described</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{our recent}} paper we <b>described</b> <b>relationships</b> between {{integrable}} systems {{inspired by the}} AGT conjecture. On the gauge theory side an integrable spin chain naturally emerges while on the conformal field theory side one obtains some special reduced Gaudin model. Two types of integrable systems were shown to be related by the spectral duality. In this paper we extend the spectral duality {{to the case of}} higher spin chains. It is proved that the N-site GL(k) Heisenberg chain is dual to the special reduced k+ 2 -points gl(N) Gaudin model. Moreover, we construct an explicit Poisson map between the models at the classical level by performing the Dirac reduction procedure and applying the AHH duality transformation.

The authors analyzed the concept maps to determine how participants organized, associated, and <b>described</b> <b>relationships</b> between the concepts. Although {{there was a lack of}} consistency in associating pairs of concepts, participants often created 2 clusters of concepts: a food web cluster and an ecosystem cluster. Associated pairs were often used in similar ways to describe the relationship among concepts. Concepts such as biotic factors and abiotic factors were frequently not used. It is important to ensure that preservice teachers have a solid understanding of ecological concepts before they begin teaching...|$|E
40|$|The {{burden of}} chronic {{illnesses}} is rising {{throughout the world}} but information on barriers to managing such diseases in developing countries is scarce.

The main barrier to chronic illness management was the cost of care. Other barriers identified were patient knowledge and beliefs, stigma, quality and trust in providers and long care pathways. Household resilience was adversely affected by chronic illness, further reducing households' {{ability to cope with}} illness. Policy options to address the barriers identified are discussed.

40|$|Underactive bladder (UAB), {{which has}} been {{described}} as a symptom complex suggestive of detrusor underactivity, is usually characterized by prolonged urination time with or without a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying, usually with hesitancy, reduced sensation on filling, and slow stream often with storage symptoms. Several causes such as aging, bladder outlet obstruction, diabetes mellitus, neurologic disorders, and nervous injury to the spinal cord, cauda equine, and peripheral pelvic nerve have been assumed to be responsible for the development of UAB. Several contributing factors have been suggested in the pathophysiology of UAB, including myogenic failure, efferent and/or afferent dysfunctions, and central nervous system dysfunction. In this review article, we have <b>described</b> <b>relationships</b> between individual contributing factors and the pathophysiology of UAB based on previous reports.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{experiences}} of women relegated to the margins of society by poverty or violence. DESIGN: Qualitative method of focus groups. SETTING: Shelters and transitional housing in southwestern Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six women staying at shelters or transitional housing. METHOD: Focus groups conducted at five locations explored the women's experiences and interactions with family physicians. MAIN FINDINGS: Two themes emerged from the analysis: power imbalances in patient-physician relationships, {{and the role of}} family physicians in creating collaborative relationships. Women who felt demeaned in patient-physician relationships described their family physicians as dominating and intimidating. Women who <b>described</b> <b>relationships</b> as collaborative felt valued and understood. CONCLUSION: Poor or abused women living in shelters who felt powerless in patient-physician relationships felt even more demeaned as they coped with the struggles associated with being poor.

40|$|Background. Recent {{data suggest}} that the renin-angiotensin system may be {{involved}} in triglyceride (TG) metabolism. We explored the effect of the common A 1166 C and C 573 T polymorphisms of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT 1 R) gene on postprandial lipemia. Methods. Eighty-two subjects measured daytime capillary TG, and postprandial lipemia was estimated as incremental area under the TG curve. The C 573 T and A 1166 C polymorphisms of the AT 1 R gene were determined. Results. Postprandial lipemia was significantly higher in homozygous carriers of the 1166 -C allele (9. 39 ± 8. 36 [*]mM*h/L) compared to homozygous carriers of the 1166 -A allele (2. 02 ± 6. 20 [*]mM*h/L) (P < 0. 05). Postprandial lipemia was similar for the different C 573 T polymorphisms. Conclusion. The 1166 -C allele of the AT 1 R gene seems to be associated with increased postprandial lipemia. These data confirm the earlier <b>described</b> <b>relationships</b> between the renin-angiotensin axis and triglyceride metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} the {{sorption}} of environmental applications by various source materials of natural organic matter, i. e., bone powder, was examined. Sorption capacities and subsequent rare earth element retention characteristics of all metals tested were markedly increased by ionic task-specific. In this study, the abilities of three models ’ isotherms widely {{were used for the}} equilibrium sorption data: Langmuir, Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson. For all studied metal ions the maximum adsorption capacity is close to those experimentally determined. The characteristic parameters for each isotherm and related coefficients of determination have been determined. The experimental data achieved excellent fits within the following isotherms in the order: Langmuir> Redlich-Peterson> Freundlich, based on their coefficient of determination values. The bone powder has developed higher adsorption performance in the removal process of Nd(III), Eu(III), La(III) from aqueous solutions than {{in the case of the}} removal process of Cs(I), Sr(II) and Tl(I) from aqueous solutions.

The current study evalu-ates the narratives of 13 adolescents in a wilderness therapy program in an attempt to understand their attitudes toward parents, therapists, and other adult figures. Results showed that while participants cited the im-portance of trusting adults in their lives, they also reported a general lack of trust between parents and themselves.
