40|$|As {{a concept}} and phenomenon, ‘flex crops and commodities’ feature ‘multiple-ness’ and ‘flexible-ness’ as two {{distinct}} but intertwined dimensions. These key crops and commodities {{are shaped by}} the changing global context that is itself remoulded by the convergence of multiple crises and various responses. The greater multiple-ness of crops and commodity uses has altered the patterns of their production, circulation and consumption, as novel dimensions of their political economy. These new patterns change the power relations between landholders, agricultural labourers, crop exporters, processors and traders; in particular, they intensify market competition among producers and incentivize changes in land-tenure arrangements. Crop and commodity flexing have three main types – namely, real flexing, anticipated/speculative flexing and imagined flexing; these have many intersections and interactions. Their political-economic dynamics involve numerous factors that variously incentivize, facilitate or hinder the ‘multiple-ness’ and/or ‘flexible-ness’ of particular crops and commodities. These dynamics include ‘flex narratives’ by corporate and state institutions to justify promotion of a flex agenda through support policies. In particular, a bioeconomy narrative envisages a future ‘value web’ developing more flexible value chains through more interdependent, <b>interchangeable</b> <b>products</b> and uses. A future research agenda should investigate questions about material bases, real-life changes, flex narratives and political mobilization...|$|E

40|$|We {{define a}} class of bias {{problems}} that arise when purchasers shift their expenditures among sellers charging different prices for units of precisely defined and <b>interchangeable</b> <b>product</b> items that are nevertheless regarded as different {{for the purposes of}} price measurement. For business-to-business transactions, these shifts can cause sourcing substitution bias in the Producer Price Index (PPI) and the Import Price Index (MPI), as well as potentially in the proposed new true Input Price Index (IPI). Similarly, when consumers shift their expenditures for the same products temporally to take advantage of promotional sales or among retailers charging different per unit prices, this can cause a promotions bias problem in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or a CPI outlet substitution bias. We recommend alternatives to conventional price indexes that make use of unit values over precisely defined and <b>interchangeable</b> <b>product</b> items. We argue that our proposed ideal target indexes could greatly reduce these biases and make use of increasingly available electronic scanner data on prices and quantities.

Serial and variant manufacturers especially strive for high capacity utilization to prevent overcapacity and to reduce fixed costs in production.

However, these approaches do not eliminate the existence of overcapacity or bottlenecks. An alternative approach for short and medium term adjustments in the given production system has to be developed. In this article, an approach to increase the capacity flexibility in production systems based on the idea of <b>interchangeable</b> <b>product</b> designs is described. The objective is the economical use of overcapacity and efficient reaction to bottlenecks.

Several different BoNTA {{products are}} marketed in various countries, {{and they are}} not <b>interchangeable.</b> Differences between <b>products</b> include manufacturing processes, formulations, and the assay methods used to determine units of biological activity. These differences result in a specific set of interactions between each BoNTA product and the tissue injected. Consequently, the products show differences in their in vivo profiles, including preclinical dose response curves and clinical dosing, efficacy, duration, and safety/adverse events. Most, but not all, published studies document these differences, suggesting that individual BoNTA products act differently depending on experimental and clinical conditions, and these differences may not always be predictable. Differentiation through regulatory approvals provides a measure of confidence in safety and efficacy at the specified doses for each approved indication. Moreover, the products differ in the amount of study to which they have been subjected, as evidenced by the number of publications in the peer-reviewed literature and {{the quantity and quality of}} clinical studies. Given that BoNTAs are potent biological products that meet important clinical needs, it is critical to recognize that their dosing and product performance are not <b>interchangeable</b> and each <b>product</b> should be used according to manufacturer guidelines.

40|$|E-proteins {{comprise}} a subfamily of helix-loop-helix transcription {{factors that have}} been identified in arthropods and several chordate taxa. In mammals, there are three classes of E-protein genes (E 2 A, E 2 - 2, and HEB) that encode related, and often <b>interchangeable,</b> gene <b>products.</b> We have determined that the clawed frog Xenopus laevis contains twice the number of transcriptionally active E-protein genes when compared with other vertebrate species. Based upon genomic Southern blots and nucleotide sequence comparisons, {{it is likely that the}} additional X. laevis genes arose from tetraploidization. During embryogenesis, XE 2 A (homologue of mammalian E 2 A) transcripts were broadly expressed in anterior and posterior regions of the embryo while homologues of E 2 - 2 (XE 2. 2) and HEB (XE 1. 2) appeared in vertebrate-specific structures including the pineal gland, olfactory bulb, and brachial arches. A phylogenetic analysis of these genes and other known metazoan E-proteins suggests that there were two periods of marked E-protein gene expansion; one that predated the radiation of vertebrates, and the other that coincided with Xenopus tetraploidization. Both of these periods were characterized by the rapid evolution of E 2 - 2 and HEB-class genes, but not of E 2 A. We propose that the former genes acquired new or specialized roles during early chordate evolution and also more recently in Xenopus, as reflected by the stereotypic expression patterns of these genes during X. laevis development...|$|R
40|$|Optical fibres {{have been}} used in sensing for almost 40 years"'. The first ideas emerged even before the concept of low loss, low {{dispersion}} fibres appeared on the horizon. Fibre sensing now has evolved in a very different context from fibre communications. The communications industry is relatively homogeneous especially at the transmission level where fibres have undoubtedly contributed critically to the revolution {{in the way in which}} society functions. Communications is also the industry of large corporate interests and to function it relies heavily on <b>interchangeable</b> <b>product</b> and therefore well defined standards and protocols. The sensing industry is markedly different. This is the domain of the specialist and the small company servicing niche needs. The niches come with their own specific demands. Operating at the bottom of an oil well is radically different from operating in deep space but temperatures and strains are to he measured in both. Some impression of this diversity can he gleaned from the observation that within the UK estimates of the number of companies involved in sensing and measurement using all technologies start at around 1, 000 and continue ever upwards - very much greater than the numbers involved in the communications business which of itself has a total turnover far exceeding that in sensing and measurement. These contrasts have a profound effect on the way in which the two industries are operated, standardised and regulated. These observations are essential background to any discussion on standards and specifications in the context of optical fibre sensors. This paper will endeavour to bring together the issues conceming standards and specification development within the industry. This is a fragmented task. The final customer is interested in measurement capability, reliability and cost. The manufacturer's task is to optimise these trade-offs within the constraints imposed through - typically ~ a small manufacturing enterprise. The manufacturer assembles his sensor system from components and often these components have been fabricated with an entirely different market in mind and are therefore less than perfectly suited to the need in question. There is always a technical risk implicit in using such components. The fragmentation is important. Chemical, biochemical, biomedical and physical measurands are all addressed using fibre based optical transducers. All operate in very different environments. Consequently, to enable some focus to this discussion, we shall concentrate here on issues concerning fibre sensors to measure physical measurands: strain, pressure, acceleration, temperature, direction and rotation are the most important of these. The main body of the paper starts with a basic description of the fibre sensor itself to highlight the critical interfaces and the areas in which standards and specification issues are foremost. There is actually relatively little standardisation material at the component level which directly supports the fibre sensor industry. There are some critical areas where recognised measurement processes and procedures would he extremely welcome. We briefly discuss the evolution of one of the most focused standards endeavours - that of fibre gyroscopes which is we believe unique in Optical Fibre Sensing in having been considered by a US based (IEEE) Standards Committee. We also mention some IEC activity. Finally this leads into a discussion on the standard processes which would he desirable, the standards which are needed and how these needs may be approached.

Note that SLs are pair of non-essential genes whose simultaneous removal can lead to zero growth (Suthers et al. 2009). Such lethality arises due to several reasons including <b>interchangeable</b> gene <b>products</b> with respect to an essential function (isozymes/isoforms), their existence in the same essential pathway or sharing of complementary essential function(s) (Suthers et al. 2009). Here, {{it should be noted}} that we excluded the inter-compartmental transporters during SL screening since the deletion of most of the transporters coupled with metabolic genes resulted in no growth. A total of 226 and 229 SLs were identified in the normal and stressed conditions, respectively. Interestingly, of the total 226 SLs the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase (FNR) in GS-GOGAT cycle, and the mitochondrial ATP synthase (ATPS) in oxidative phosphorylation were paired with 83 and 82 other genes of rice central metabolism, respectively. FNR is involved in reassimilating the ammonia released during photorespiration via Fd-GOGAT and maintaining the redox balance of plastids (Foyer et al. 2009) whereas ATPS is utilized to generate necessary energy for the cell growth via mitochondrial respiration (Lakshmanan et al. 2013). Several SLs also contained the isoforms of same enzymes across different compartments. Such examples include the cytosolic and plastidic isoforms of enolase, phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase and triosephosphate isomerase, and the cytosolic and mitochondrial isoforms of malate dehydrogenase (see Additional file 2 for the entire list of SLs).|$|R

40|$|What is a house? What is dwelling? How can a house be a body? What is “being modern” {{in rural}} Africa? How are {{local and global}} worlds {{intertwined}} through material culture? This book reflects on the meanings of housing in West-Africa. It analyses vernacular architectural traditions and the related ideas and worldviews grounding these building traditions. In the West, much {{attention is paid to}} the quality of housing in terms of material comfort and durability. However, houses do no longer grow organically, and are no longer layered by time, or embedded in a social community and intertwined with the natural environment. The house, and even more the interior of the house, has become the expression of the individuality of the inhabitant (see the whole marketing of lifestyle, design, interior decoration, cocooning, etcetera). Paradoxically, though, this {{goes hand in hand with}} the erosion of the house as a signifier. Houses are becoming almost generic realities, without a memory or a past, anonymous results of mass-production, or <b>interchangeable,</b> standardized <b>products</b> of a globalised Ikea- and key-on-the-door culture. Many of the important phases of the lifecycles of the inhabitants no longer unfold within the house, but are evacuated to spaces external to it (hospitals, restaurants, hotels, party rooms, morgues, banquet halls). In contrast to the poor signifier the Western house has become, the chapters in this book analyse the rich meanings embedded in processes of dwelling in rural West-African worlds, with a specific emphasis on Ghana and Burkina Faso. At the same time, the authors document the changes that are manifest in the material and social structures of the house, and show the flexibility and responsiveness of traditional practices of building and dwelling when confronted with influences of urban modernity. As such, this reflection on local architectural forms also deals with many of the challenges and issues currently at stake in Africa. nrpages: 213 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Background: Slovenia aims to {{regulate}} and reimburse prices of medicinal products {{in order to}} manage and reduce public expenditure for medicinal products. Two levels of reference prices (R) are used: external R with a regulated maximum price and internal R with a maximum attributed value, defined by reference pricing for <b>interchangeable</b> medicinal <b>products.</b> The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia covers expenses for their prescribed use and negotiates prices. The objective of our article was to confirm the basic thesis that the price regulation system and reimbursement have caused {{the decline in the}} regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for medicinal products. Consequently, the decline in prices might contribute to a reduction of public expenditures for medicinal products. Methods: The research covered 760 regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices for both groups of medicinal products prescribed on an outpatient prescription and financed by public expenditures. The Laspeyres index and Wilcoxon signed ranks test are used to estimate the impact of wholesale price regulation system and reimbursement on the trends in nominal and real wholesale prices of medicinal products in the period 2003 – 2010. Results: The main thesis that the nominal and real wholesale prices of medicinal products declined during the years 2003 – 2010, was confirmed by the Laspeyres index. The Wilcoxon signed ranks test further confirmed the existence of statistically significant differences in the wholesale prices of medicinal products (p < 0. 05). With 5 % significance level, we can conclude that the regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices of medicinal products have declined during the analysed years. The regulated and reimbursed nominal and real wholesale prices ofgeneric medicinal products have declined more than the prices of original medicinal products. Conclusions: We have found that the analysed regulated and reimbursed wholesale prices of medicinal products have declined during the analysed period 2003 – 2010. The price regulation system and reimbursement with an efficient use and supply of medicinal products could have positive effects on the management and reduction of public expenditure for medicinal products.

40|$|Generic {{medicines}} {{are approved}} by regulatory authorities based on demonstration of bioequivalence with the innovator, however, current regulatory systems {{do not require}} direct comparison between all available generics of the same innovator to ensure interchangeability. As such, interchangeability between generics of the same drug isassumed, although {{it has not been}} addressed comprehensively by regulators. Thus, this thesis addresses three main interlinked issues with respect to interchangeability of generic medicines particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in a global context. First, this thesis shows that adjusted indirect treatment comparison is a pragmatic approach to identify <b>interchangeable</b> generic <b>products</b> by comparing the different generics that have been demonstrated to be bioequivalent with the same comparator product. Further, in contrast to the ± 20 % acceptance range used for direct comparisons, a ± 30 % acceptance range is proposed for adjusted indirect comparisons, due to the limited precision of indirect comparisons. The outcome of the indirect comparisons indicates that the antimalarial artemether/lumefantrine, first-line antituberculosis, and first-line antiretroviral generics prequalified by the World Health Organization (WHO) can be interchanged without any safety and efficacy concerns in the clinical settings. To ensure switchability between the generics, the generic and the comparator should not differ significantly (i. e. point estimates should not exceed the 7 % difference) and the original studies should be sufficiently powered (i. e. > 80 %). In this respect an additional point estimate constraint of ± 10 % is proposed, particularly for LMICs where the regulators may not provide guidance to health professionals on the switchability of approved products or when generic substitution is recommended by national governments or the third party reimbursement agencies. A lower point estimate constraint of ± 5 %, is proposed for NTI drugs, especially where neither generic switching of these drugs is restricted nor narrowed bioequivalence acceptance limits applied. Second, this thesis shows {{that it is possible to}} have the necessary arrangements for product registration for generic medicines that will ensure that nationally approved products are of sufficient quality and interchangeable, and to adopt resource-efficient approaches without duplications in LMICs. The collaborative case model in the context of global harmonisation efforts, not only in LMICs, but also in high-income countries demonstrates that collaboration in assessments is feasible and probably the most pragmatic approach that countries in LMICs should use to build capacity and to ensure quality and interchangeable medicines in the market. Third, this thesis shows that most countries follow the WHO recommendations for selecting comparator products and require the comparator product to be obtained from their national markets. These recommendations are only feasible in the few countries where the repetition of the bioequivalence study is profitable, but they are impracticable in all other countries, especially LMICs. Therefore, this thesis proposes that the innovator product from well-regulated markets should be the global comparator as it is ineffectual to harmonize only the requirements for performing bioequivalence studies, if such a study has to be repeated for every single country simply because of the different comparator product...|$|R
40|$|The {{competition}} {{policy in the}} EU should guarantee that the competition is not distorted {{in the way that}} would prevent or create difficulties for the free mobility of goods and services between Member states. It is prohibited for companies to abuse their dominant position according to Article 82, if it affects trade. The essence of Article 82 is control of market power. The perfect competition results when supply and demand appoint the price and quantity of a product. Firms are encouraged to compete then it results in efficiency, quality products and lower prices. Dominance can be assessed only in relation to three essential variables: the product market, the geographical market and the temporal factor. The determination of the relevant product market is crucial. The general approach of the Commission and the Court to the definition of the product market has been to focus upon interchangeability, {{the extent to which the}} <b>product</b> is <b>interchangeable</b> with other <b>products.</b> From the demand side interchangeability requires investigation of cross-elasticities of the product. The existence of high cross-elasticities indicates that the products are part of the same market. There are different types of abuse, for example price discrimination, refusal to supply and predatory pricing. In Tetra Pak the ECJ held that the company that was a world leader in the manufacture of aseptic cartons for liquid and semi-liquid food had abused its dominant position on the market for aseptic cartons. Tetra Pak asserted that only their products could be used in production when using their machines. Their behaviour, according to ECJ, was abusive then they tried to tie-in consumers and customers. This way of behaviour could also be seen in the Hilti-case concerning nail guns. Tying occurs when the supplier makes the sale of one product (the tying product) conditional upon the purchase of another distinct product (the tied product) from the supplier or someone designated by the latter. Tying is common practice that often has no anticompetitive consequences. The foreclosure of the tied market may allow the dominant company to achieve larger profits in the tied market. We can see the importance of case-law, when the definition of Article 82 is broad. For example have the United Brands-case and Akzo-case determined the presumption for market share and dominant position. The case-law will grow larger through the years and we think it will be clearer for companies what is allowed and forbidden. The problem today is that the competition law is rather indistinct...|$|R
40|$|In 2014, {{approximately}} 6. 8 {{million people}} in South Africa were HIV-positive, {{and the majority of}} those affected are aged 15 or older. A fixed-dose combination (FDC) antiretroviral (ARV) dosage form containing one non-nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz) and two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (emtricitabine and tenofovir) was licensed in South Africa in April 2013. New consolidated guidelines for HIV management and prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) were published by the South African Department of Health in December 2014 and the FDC is now the recommended first-line treatment for HIV-positive patients. According to these guidelines all such people aged 15 and older, and weighing more than 40 kg, with a CD 4 count of ≤ 500 / μl will be eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART) using the FDC. In addition every pregnant and breastfeeding woman is eligible for lifelong ART regardless of CD 4 count and EFV can be used as first-line treatment for pregnant women regardless of the length of gestation state of the pregnancy at that time. The use of this simplified regime is likely to promote much needed and improved adherence to therapy. An investigation into the development of a stability-indicating reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method for the simultaneous quantitation of EFV, FTC and TNF was undertaken. Isocratic HPLC analysis was found to be unsuitable due to the highly polar FTC molecule eluting in the void. Therefore a gradient HPLC method was developed and validated. The method was validated according to the International Conference on Harmonisation, now known as International Council for Harmonization (ICH). Correlation coefficients > 0. 999 were obtained for each assessment of linearity and FTC, TNF and EFV are linear in the range 0. 4 - 40 μg/ml, 0. 6 - 60 μg/ml and 1. 2 - 120 μg/ml. The equation of the best-fit least squares regression lines for FTC, TNF and EFV were y = 0. 0191 x+ 0. 0007, y = 0. 0163 x+ 0. 0116 and y = 0. 01 x+ 0. 016, respectively. The method is accurate as the y-intercept was < 2 % of the detector response for all ARV, and the method is precise in terms of intra- and inter-assay precision as all % RSD < 2 %. The stability-indicating nature of the method was demonstrated under acidic, alkaline and oxidative stress in addition to UV exposure and elevated temperatures, and the individual chromatograms were overlaid using Empower® 3 Software to establish whether there was interference with the peaks of interest. The forced degradation studies demonstrated the selectivity of the method for the ARV compounds. The method was applied to assay and in vitro dissolution studies of commercially available tablets. The amount of each active ingredient released from Atripla® was determined and compared to the amount of each drug released from Aspen Efavirenz® and Truvada® (a combination of FTC and TNF). The percent FTC released from Atripla® and Truvada® was similar based on the acceptance criteria for immediate-release BCS class 1 compounds. Statistical analysis was undertaken to compare the dissolution profiles of FTC, TNF and EFV. The percent of these compounds released in these studies indicate that bioequivalence testing would be required to declare these <b>products</b> <b>interchangeable.</b> The validated RP-HPLC and in vitro dissolution test method are suitable for routine quality control testing of solid oral dosage forms containing EFV, FTC and TNF, and as the dissolution method can discriminate between different formulations of the same molecule, these tools can also be used for analysis during formulation development studies. The method is not suitable for the analysis of the ARV plasma due to lack of sensitivity and an inability to quantitate the compounds at the required concentration levels. The use of HPLC with mass spectroscopy for quantitation would enhance the sensitivity of the method and may eliminate the quantitation of the molecules in the presence of interference that was observed when using UV detection. Fixed dose combination tablets are convenient for patient therapy and it is likely that in the future more molecules will be formulated into such dosage forms. However formulations such as these can pose significant difficulties when developing and using analytical methods for the quantitation of all compounds in the dosage form at the same time, in particular when the compounds have vastly different physico-chemical properties that impact the quality of a separation and therefore the analysis. Therefore when embarking on the development of FDC product cognisance of the difficulties of developing single methods for the analyses is required and approaches to overcome these difficulties should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Towards a bio-economy: {{the role}} of the forest Biomass has an {{increasingly}} important role in replacing fossil and mineral resources, and it is central in environmental impact-reduction strategies in companies and governments, locally, nationally and internationally. The European Union (EU) has recently taken action to strengthen the bio-economy, defined as “…the sustainable production and conversion of biomass into a range of food, health, fibre and industrial products and energy”. Two thirds of the land area in Sweden is covered by forests, and forestry has been an important industry for centuries. Increased and/or more efficient use of forest biomass thus has a great potential for replacing the use of fossil and mineral resources in Sweden. There are two main reasons for why forest- and other bio-based products are seen as environmentally beneficial. Biomass is (most often) a renewable resource, in contrast to finite fossil and mineral resources, and there is often a balance between CO 2 captured when the biomass grows, and CO 2 released when the bio-based product is incinerated. The challenge: calculate carbon footprints Moving towards a bio-economy means replacing non-renewable fuels and materials with bio-based fuels and materials. This is a transition on many levels: technology, business models, infrastructure, political priorities, etc. To guide such a grand transition, {{there is a need to}} understand the environmental implications of new bio-based products. This includes assessing their climate impact, so-called carbon footprinting. Carbon footprinting of forest products is not as simple as saying that forest products are carbon and climate neutral by definition. Fossil energy used for producing and transporting the products has a carbon footprint. Also, the carbon balance can differ between forest products, which can influence their carbon footprint. For example, carbon stored in products, while CO 2 is captured in the re-growing forest, can mitigate climate change. The modelling of the carbon balance is influenced by the study’s geographical system boundaries – national, regional, landscape and single-stand perspectives often yield different results. Forestry can also lead to positive or negative changes in the levels of carbon stored in the soil, the levels of aerosols emitted by the trees (influencing cloud formation), and the albedo (surface reflectivity) of the forest land. An indirect effect of forestry can be increased competition for land, with expanding or intensified land use elsewhere, with positive or negative climate effects. All these factors are potentially important when calculating carbon footprints. There is limited knowledge about how and to which extent the aforementioned factors influence the carbon footprint of forest products. Also, there is a lack of methods for assessing some of these factors. In light of this, can the carbon footprints of today be trusted? And can we ensure that they provide relevant and robust decision support? Our approach: testing three different carbon footprint methods in five case studies In this study, we have: Identified different carbon footprint methods. Used the identified methods to calculate the carbon footprint of different forest products and non-forest benchmarks (using life cycle assessment, LCA). Compared the results to find out how and why they differ. We identified three main categories of carbon footprint methods: (i) the common practice in LCA, (ii) recommendations in standards and directives (we tested the EU sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids and the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) guide), and (iii) more advanced methods proposed in the scientific literature (we tested dynamic LCA). For dynamic LCA, we tested different time horizons (20 and 100 years) and different geographical system boundaries, based on (a) the national level, assuming a net annual growth of biomass (which is the case in Sweden); (b) the landscape level, assuming a balance between the annual harvesting and growth (the level at which forests are often managed); and (c) the stand level, assuming regrowth during a time period of 80 years (a stand is the part of a landscape that is harvested in one year, a level often used by researchers developing new methods for modelling the dynamics of forest carbon flows). These methods were applied to five forest products: two automotive fuels (a lignin-based fuel produced from black liquor and butanol), a textile fibre (viscose), a timber structure building, and a chemical (methanol, used for different end products). Our findings We found that different carbon footprint methods can give different results. The common practice is close to the recommendation in the EU sustainability criteria and the PEF guide. Results from dynamic LCA differ considerably, as it accounts for the timing of (fossil and biogenic) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and CO 2 capture, which is ignored by the other methods. The results of dynamic LCA depend primarily on the geographical system boundaries, but also on the time horizon. When applying dynamic LCA with a stand perspective, we assumed that the CO 2 uptake occurs after harvest. Alternatively, one could assume that the CO 2 uptake occurs before harvest, which would give different (lower) results. When comparing the carbon footprints of the forest products with products they could be expected to replace, we see that the results for the forest products could range from being definitely favourable to worse. More results can be found in the full report. Results were produced to answer the research questions of this study, and should not be used out of context. Conclusions and recommendations Because there is (still) limited knowledge about how forest products influence the climate, and as carbon footprints will always depend on value-based assumptions (e. g. regarding geographical system boundaries), it is not possible to recommend one specific method which is suitable regardless of context. As different carbon footprint methods can give very different results, our key message is that we need to increase consciousness on these matters. It is important to be aware of the assumptions made in the study, the effects of those assumptions on results, and how results can and cannot be used for decision support in a certain context. More specific recommendations for decision makers are listed below. Further details and results can be found in the main report, along with recommendations for LCA practitioners and researchers. Decision makers must be aware that the main methodological choices influencing carbon footprints of Swedish forest products are the choice of geographical system boundaries (e. g. national-, landscape- or stand-level system boundaries) and whether the timing of CO 2 capture and GHG emissions is accounted for. This is because Swedish forests are, in general, slow growing. If the aim of the decision is to obtain short-term climate impact reduction – for example, the urgent reduction that is possibly needed for preventing the world average temperature to rise with more than 2 °C – the timing of CO 2 capture and GHG emissions should be taken into account. Decision makers must be aware that a particular method for capturing timing (such as dynamic LCA) can be combined with different system boundaries, which can yield different results. When conclusions from existing LCA studies are synthesized for decision support, the decision maker must be aware that most existing studies do not account for the timing of CO 2 capture and GHG emissions. This is particularly important when the decision concerns the prioritization of forest products with different service lives (e. g., fuels versus buildings). When timing is considered, decision makers must be aware that there are different views on when the CO 2 capture occurs, which will influence the carbon footprint. One could either consider the CO 2 captured before the harvest (i. e., the capture of the carbon that goes into the product system), or the CO 2 captured after the harvest (i. e., the consequence of the harvest operation). In this study, we tested the second alternative when we applied dynamic LCA with a stand perspective – this does not mean we advocate the use of the second alternative over the first alternative. Decision makers must be aware that the location and management practices of the forestry influence the climate impact of a forest product. For example, growth rates, changes in soil carbon storages and fertilisers (a source of GHGs) differ between locations. Based on our results, we cannot say that the carbon footprints of some product categories are more robust than for others, i. e. less influenced by choice of methodology. However, the more forest biomass use in the product system, the higher the influence of the choice of method. As many interactions between the forest and the climate are still not fully understood, it is important to be open to new knowledge gained in methodology development work. Regarding how to use Swedish forests for the most efficient climate impact reduction, it is impossible to draw a general conclusion on the basis of our results. Factors that influence the “optimal” use are:Which fraction of forest biomass that is used. Various products use different fractions (as was the case in our case studies) and do not necessarily compete for the same biomass. However, a production system may be more or less optimised for a specific output. So there may be situations of competition also when feedstocks are not directly <b>interchangeable.</b> Which non-forest <b>product</b> that is assumed to be replaced by the forest product (if any). The carbon footprint of the non-forest product matters, but also how large the substitution effect is (i. e., does the forest product actually replace the non-forest alternative, or merely add products to the market, and what are the rebound effects from increased production?). If all other factors are identical: the longer the service life of the forest product the better, due to the climate benefit of storing carbon and thereby delaying CO 2 emissions. This effect is particularly strong if the aim is to obtain short-term climate impact reduction. Moreover, the effect supports so-called cascade use of forest biomass, e. g. first using wood in a building structure, then reusing the wood in a commodity, and at end-of-life, as late as possible, recovering the energy content of the wood for heat or fuel production. Traditional LCA practice and methods required by the EU sustainability criteria and PEF have limitations in the support they can provide for the transition to a bio-economy, as they cannot capture the variations of different forest products in terms of rotation periods and service lives. Thus, decision makers need to consider studies using more advanced methods to be able to distinguish better or worse uses of forest biomass. We have tested one such advanced method (dynamic LCA), that proved applicable in combination with several different geographical perspectives, but also other methods exist (e. g. GWPbio). Climate change is not the only environmental impact category which is relevant in decision making concerned with how to use forests. Other environmental issues, such as loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services, are also important. There are also non-environmental sustainability issues of potential importance, e. g. related to indigenous rights and job creation.
