5|$|To be an {{automatic}} process, the effect should, for each specific person, be fairly stable over time. Koole, Dijksterhuis and van Knippenberg investigated this by asking Dutch students to rate each {{letter of the}} alphabet, together with some filler questions for distraction, twice within a four-week period. They found that preferences for name letters did not significantly change {{between the first and}} second rating. Hoorens and colleagues also found that ratings remained stable when 164 subjects rated letters seven <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{locomotive}} {{returned to}} Norway on 1 July 1955, {{where it was}} numbered 602 and put into service on the Nordland Line. The trials were successful, with much higher regularity than the steam locomotives. The Di 3 was used eight <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> and then spent a single day in the depot. NSB {{signed an agreement with}} NOHAB for delivery of five further locomotives. This caused a public debate, because the domestic supplier Thune had offered to build a similar locomotive in cooperation with American Locomotive Company. The first delivery was made on 25 April 1957, and the order completed by July. In March 1957 NSB received permission to buy another eight locomotives. Delivery started in October and was completed on 1 June 1958. The order was supplemented with another six trains, with delivery in 1958.|$|E

25|$|Solar {{power is}} more {{predictable}} than wind power and less variable – {{while there is}} never any solar power available during the night, {{and there is a}} reduction in winter, the only unknown factors in predicting solar output each day is cloud cover, frost and snow. Many <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> in some locations are relatively cloud free, just as many <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> in either the same or other locations are overcast – leading to relatively high predictability. Wind comes from the uneven heating of the earth's surface, and can provide about 1% of the potential energy that is available from solar power. 86,000 TW of solar energy reaches the surface of the world vs. 870 TW in all of the world's winds. Total world demand is roughly 12 TW, many times less than the amount that could be generated from potential wind and solar resources. From 40 to 85 TW could be provided from wind and about 580 TW from solar.|$|E

25|$|According to the {{canonical}} gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus Christ spent 40 days fasting in the desert, where he endured temptation by Satan. Lent originated as a mirroring of this, fasting 40 days as preparation for Easter. Every Sunday {{was seen as}} a commemoration of the Sunday of Christ's resurrection and so as a feast day on which fasting was inappropriate. Accordingly, Christians fasted from Monday to Saturday (six days) during six weeks and from Wednesday to Saturday (four days) in the preceding week, thus making up the number of 40 days. Orthodox Christians do this 40 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row.</b>|$|E
25|$|With his {{effectiveness}} {{hindered by}} {{the necessity of}} pitching two <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row,</b> the Browns found themselves on their heels quickly when ace Bob Caruthers walked four of the first five batters, surrendering a second run on a base hit given up to third baseman Tom Burns of the Chicagos. The game was called after completion of eight innings due to darkness. John Clarkson was again {{on top of his}} game as the right hander struck out 8 Browns in earning his second win of the series. Caruthers took the loss for the Browns, giving Chicago a lead of two games to one in the series.|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 1999, a {{powerful}} {{beam of light}} was unveiled for the first time. Called the Legacy Light or Skybeam, it is powered by lamps that total 85 million candela shining skyward {{from the top of}} the Space Needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in Seattle. The concept of this beam was derived from the official 1962 World's Fair poster, which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design. It is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates. Originally planned to be turned on 75 nights per year, it has generally been used fewer than a dozen times per year. It did remain lit for eleven <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> from September 11, 2001, to September 22, 2001, in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks.|$|E

25|$|In North America, on {{its opening}} day (Wednesday, August 10, 2011), it topped {{the box office}} with $5.54 million. It then added $4.33 million on Thursday, declining only 21 percent, a two-day total to $9.87 million. On its first weekend, the film grossed $26.0 million, coming in second place behind Rise of the Planet of the Apes. However, during its second weekend, the film jumped to first place with $20.0 million, declining only 23 percent, the {{smallest}} drop among films playing nationwide. The film crossed the $100 million mark on its 21st day of release, becoming {{one of only two}} titles in August 2011 that achieved this. On its fourth weekend (Labor Day three-day weekend), it became the first film since Inception (2010), to top the box-office charts for three consecutive weekends. Its four-day weekend haul of $19.9 million was the fourth largest for a Labor-day weekend. Notably, The Help topped the box office for 25 <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row.</b> This was the longest uninterrupted streak since The Sixth Sense (35 days), which was also a late summer release, in 1999.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} Atlantic coast has warm summers (28°C to 32°C, {{but with}} relatively cool nights at 15°C) and mild winters, with highs of about 12°C and lows about 2–3°C. Occasionally, temperatures reach −10°C or 40°C, and rainfall is very scarce. It only gets a bit colder further south in Chubut, {{and the city}} of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of 24°C to 28°C, nights of 12°C to 16°C, and winters with days around 10°C and nights around 3°C, and less than 250mm of rain. However, there is a drastic drop as we move south to Santa Cruz: Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temps of 17°C to 21°C, (nights between 6°C and 10°C) and winter temperatures of 2°C to 6°C, with nights between −5°C and 0°C despite being right on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under −18°C and to remain below freezing for several <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row.</b> Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest places on Earth, with winds reaching 100km h occasionally.|$|E

500|$|Although it {{is often}} taken for granted, {{it is not at}} all clear how one can infer the {{validity}} of a general statement from a number of specific instances or infer the truth of a theory from a series of successful tests. For example, a chicken observes that each morning the farmer comes and gives it food, for hundreds of <b>days</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row.</b> The chicken may therefore use inductive reasoning to infer that the farmer will bring food every morning. However, one morning, the farmer comes and kills the chicken. How is scientific reasoning more trustworthy than the chicken's reasoning? ...|$|E

Churchill later learned that the staff were moving files out. When Churchill finally came to the Ministry's offices, he was met with what he termed [...] "the coldest reception that I have ever received in my life".
