5000|$|During {{the filming}} of Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick learned that <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe,</b> a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> was to be an ultrarealistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot {{resemblance}} would damage his films box office potential, especially if it were released first. Indeed, the novel Fail-Safe (on which the film is based) is so similar to Red Alert that Peter George sued on charges of plagiarism and settled out of court. What worried Kubrick most was that <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> boasted acclaimed director Sidney Lumet and first-rate dramatic actors Henry Fonda as the American President and Walter Matthau as the advisor to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into <b>Fail</b> <b>Safes</b> production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove: [...] "We started casting. Fonda was already set ... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter the screenwriter was set ... And suddenly, this lawsuit arrived, filed by Stanley Kubrick and Columbia Pictures." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> and Dr. Strangelove {{were both}} {{produced}} by Columbia Pictures {{in the period}} after the Cuban Missile Crisis, when people became much {{more sensitive to the}} threat of nuclear war. Strangelove director Stanley Kubrick, who adapted Peter George's novel Red Alert, insisted that the studio release his movie first (in January 1964). <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> so closely resembled Red Alert that Kubrick and George filed a copyright infringement lawsuit. The case was settled out of court.|$|R

That is to say into signals which {{in the presence of}} failures will be either correct or safe. The strongly fail-safe property is achieved by means of concurrent checking techniques. The interest of this interface is that it can be implemented in VLSI, while the conventional fail-safe interfaces require to use discrete components...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Main Rotor Hub {{is a very}} {{critical}} component of the helicopter considering that its failure may determine catastrophic consequences for the whole rotorcraft. A complete experimental and numerical analysis is so necessary to certificate the <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> and eventually the damage tolerant behavior of the component. In this paper the <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> behavior of a composite titanium-graphite Rotor Hub is analyzed. The component, with artificial technological defects, was tested with complex contingent fatigue load in order to cause {{the failure of the}} titanium section. The failure started in proximity of a high stressed area and it propagated quickly in the whole titanium section but without involve the surrounding filament winding graphite, that is a <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> device. The behavior of the hub during the whole test is simulated, with good accuracy, by means of a complete FE model that reproduces also the 3 D propagation of the crack in the titanium section...|$|R

50|$|Safety during pigging {{relies on}} the strict {{adherence}} to safety procedures, which give detailed description of a <b>safe</b> <b>valve</b> operating sequence. By physically blocking incorrect operations, valve interlocks enforce such sequences, rather than interfering with them.

40|$|Predictions {{are made}} of the {{contributions}} that acoustic loading and pressurisation cycling may make {{to the growth of}} a longitudinal crack in the pressure cabin of an aircraft. The results of the analysis show that the contribution to crack growth from the acoustic loading may exceed the contribution from pressurisation cycling, even though the acoustic loading alone is not sufficiently severe to initiate fatigue damage. It may be necessary therefore to make allowance for acoustic loading when establishing the <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> characteristics of such structure and of other areas of structure where <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> considerations apply. Simplifying assumptions are made in the analysis and there is need for experimental studies to substantiate the above predictions...|$|R
