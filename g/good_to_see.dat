The Atlantics Caitlan Smith was skeptical about Liz and Carol's relationship lasting, saying that Damon [...] "who commands more than $20million per movie, won't stick around for long, leaving Liz Lemon Carol-less and in for another round of the entertaining self-loathing that we've all been coming back for four seasons." ...|$|E

Sarah Stegall awarded the episode five stars {{out of five}} and noted [...] "Being dead has done wonders for Fox Mulder." [...] Stegall {{concluded}} that the episode [...] "is {{one of the best}} episodes of the new era. Mulder and Scully get one last chance to remind us why we will miss them, and Doggett and Reyes get a chance to earn their stripes.

[...] John Bellany, on the other hand, said that [...] "The emotional, artistic side of [...] nature... admire the audacity and imagination, challenging art and the art manipulators. The rational side of me asks, is this the most expensive art publicity stunt this century, and for whom?" ...|$|E

He said although it started slow, [...] "once this episode found its legs, it was non-stop funny." [...] Isler praised the South Park writers for {{coming up with}} a surprisingly funny plot, and said it ranked among Butters' best moments in the series. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said it was <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an episode focused strictly on comedy, after a string of episodes focusing on social satire. Delgado said the premise of the episode was absurd and over-the-top, but appreciated that South Park was continuing to push boundaries by mocking such issues as prostitution.|$|E
500|$|In the song, lyrically Madonna asks {{questions}} for a lover {{she is about}} to abandon: [...] "Does it make you feel <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me cry? I think it does", she affirms. The lyric [...] "I'd like to hurt you" [...] was compared to that of Madonna's previous single [...] "Erotica", where she said: [...] "I only hurt the ones I love". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post noted that Madonna used a [...] "sonically filtered, detached and slightly taunting voice to talk about taking control rather than exacting revenge on a domineering, mind-game-playing partner" [...] in the song. Regarding the lyrics, Chris Willman from Los Angeles Times called [...] "Bye Bye Baby" [...] a [...] "brushoff song".|$|E
500|$|Commentators noted Beck's actions {{led to a}} Streisand effect; {{his suit}} against the website drew {{increased}} attention to it. Representatives of Public Citizen, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the Citizen Media Law Project were all {{of the opinion that}} Beck's trademark argument in his complaint against the website was ridiculous. The assistant director of the Citizen Media Law Project applauded WIPO's decision, saying, [...] "It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that this WIPO arbitrator had no interest in allowing Beck to circumvent the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution." [...] Beck's representative declined comment to PC Magazine about the conclusion of the case. Lawyers for Beck did not respond to a request from National Public Radio for a comment about the WIPO ruling.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Newsweek, critic Jack Kroll {{thought the}} early part of the film was handled [...] "with wit and style", {{although}} he went on to say that the director was [...] "hamstrung by Lorenzo Semple's script". Richard Schickel, writing in Time magazine praised the film and its cast. He wrote that Klaus Maria Brandauer's character was [...] "played with silky, neurotic charm", While Barbara Carrera, playing Fatima Blush, [...] "deftly parodies all the fatal femmes who have slithered through Bond's career". Schickel's highest praise was saved for the return of Connery, observing [...] "it is <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Connery's grave stylishness in this role again. It makes Bond's cynicism and opportunism seem the product of genuine worldliness (and world weariness) as opposed to Roger Moore's mere twirpishness." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mother and Child Reunion" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from the media. Stephanie McGrath of Canoe.ca's AllPop acknowledged Miriam McDonald's portrayal of Emma Nelson as [...] "stellar acting abilities in a super creepy storyline... high on tension, low on cheese [...] top-notch", and continued, [...] "The young actors actually showed up their classic Degrassi counter-parts {{in the pilot}} episode. Their acting was solid, believable and age-appropriate, {{while some of the}} older crowd's dialogue sounded a bit stilted and over-rehearsed. Slightly wooden acting aside, it was still <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Joey, Caitlin and the gang together again. Emma's story-line demonstrates that the creative forces behind The Next Generation haven't lost touch with teens yet, showing that one instalment of Degrassi: The Next Generation is worth 20 episodes of Dawson's Creek." ...|$|E
500|$|Wendy Davis of Online Media Daily {{commented on}} the {{potential}} impact of the case, and observed it was a victory for proponents of Internet rights. Davis pointed out a judgment for Beck would have enabled additional WIPO cases from individuals who were the focus of satire on the web, as a way for those people to avoid judgment in U.S. courts which adhere to First Amendment case law. [...] John Cook of Gawker called Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain name over to Beck an optimal end to the affair which emphasized the ridiculousness of Beck's actions. Citizen Media Law Project assistant director Sam Bayard applauded WIPO's decision, noting, [...] "It's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that this WIPO arbitrator had no interest in allowing Beck to circumvent the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution." ...|$|E

Allison Stewart of The Washington Post called the song as a [...] "yearning ballad". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times was {{skeptical of the}} lyrical content presented in the song, commenting, [...] "unlike teen-pop stars a whole {{two or three years}} older than he is, Mr. Bieber isn’t shy about planting the seeds of corruption". Marc Hirsh of the Boston Globe said that the song combines the Disney route of songs comparing love to a fairytale, and unintentional comedy in the lines [...] "'Ain’t no chaperones[...] [...] Girl, I promise I’ll be gentle/ I know we gotta do it slowly’ in a song literally about prom." ...|$|E
500|$|Woodburne {{has said}} she never gets bored of playing Susan as she changes all the time. She added [...] "One of the upsides of this job {{is that in a}} week you might be doing {{absolute}} slapstick comedy, you might be doing high drama/tragedy and in between maybe some nice subtle interesting stuff as well, the character keeps changing and evolving depending on who she is interacting with". Woodburne has said that her favourite storyline has been the Susan, Karl and Izzy love triangle. As Susan is normally a good person, it gave her a chance to have a character (Izzy) that she could hate. Woodburne added [...] "It was good to play those much meaner, darker, angrier, cruel moments than always to be the kind character. It was <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> those dents in her armour I think".|$|E

500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "a decent if uneven {{penultimate}} episode that gave us {{one last look at}} this quirky group of people in their office environment". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that [...] "Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I, [...] have to admit, I love Goofy Jim myself". Campbell {{felt that the}} episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. She wrote that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." [...] Furthermore, Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving, calling the latter [...] "a slice of bliss".|$|E
