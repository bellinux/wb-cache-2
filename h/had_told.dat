5|$|A {{nurse at}} Dalldorf, Thea Malinovsky, claimed {{years after the}} patient's release from the asylum that the woman <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her she was another {{daughter}} of the Tsar, Anastasia, {{in the autumn of}} 1921. However, the patient herself could not recall the incident. Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim, or weave it into their narrative.|$|E
5|$|In Mark, Salome and Mary, {{mother of}} James are with Mary Magdalene (Mark 16:1). In the tomb, {{a young man}} in a white robe (an angel) tells them that Jesus will meet his disciples in Galilee, as he <b>had</b> <b>told</b> them (referring to Mark 14:28).|$|E

5|$|After the {{retirement}} of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski, the Davis Cup team was now dependent on Murray having to win three matches, though Henman <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him how wearing and time consuming that can be. While the LTA was funding Brad Gilbert, Murray was obligated to play for his country, but in November, Murray finished with Brad Gilbert as his coach.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, forgoing her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who <b>had</b> <b>told</b> the truth, as Chamunda <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on the {{airplane}} to Berlin, flashbacks are interlaced throughout the episode, illustrating the tensions caused by Eli's frequent absence during Ziva's adolescence and the disintegration of Rivka (Weronika Rosati) and Eli David's marriage. Also while on the plane, Ziva explains her rationale for changing their destination: her father <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her to convert all funds to diamonds with a dealer in Berlin should she ever need to go into hiding. She assumes {{that he would have}} given Bodnar, who he viewed as a son, the same advice.|$|E

5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska (1946–1975) was a Quarter Horse broodmare who {{produced}} eight foals, {{three of which}} would become world champion race horses.

He {{felt he had to}} because one of his employees <b>had</b> <b>told</b> a customer the filly was for sale.|$|E
5|$|In November 1934, Butler {{told the}} {{committee}} that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him {{that a group of}} businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The New York Times reported that Butler <b>had</b> <b>told</b> friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports said}} that she had been killed by an {{explosion}} set off by one of her captors. A joint official investigation by the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that her fatal injuries were inflicted by a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers. A February 2011 coroner's narrative verdict reported that Norgrove died during the failed rescue attempt. In October 2012, one of her colleagues {{said in an interview that}} the captors <b>had</b> <b>told</b> Norgrove that they had no intention of killing her.|$|E

5|$|Later, Doggett confronts Kersh, {{who was not}} {{implicated in}} the conspiracy. Kersh {{explains}} to Doggett that he left the evidence that helped Doggett, and that he <b>had</b> <b>told</b> Mulder to flee, but ultimately it was Scully who actually convinced Mulder to do so. Meanwhile, Scully dreams of McMahon's and Rohrer's lifeless bodies below the harbor. Suddenly, she sees McMahon's eyes snap open. Scully wakes up and the episode cuts to William's mobile; it begins to move on its own accord.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 2010, an {{official}} from the U.S. State Department said that Abdulmutallab's visa was not revoked because federal authorities {{believed that it}} would have compromised a larger investigation. The official, Patrick F. Kennedy, said intelligence officials <b>had</b> <b>told</b> the State Department that letting Abdulmutallab keep his visa would allow for a greater chance of exposing the terrorist network.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, Cross {{abruptly}} resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him that Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that {{that made his}} position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: {{he said that he}} had been asked by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him that if he did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General. Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.|$|E

5|$|On November 6, 2008, Emanuel {{accepted}} {{the position of}} White House Chief of Staff for US President Barack Obama. He resigned his congressional seat effective January 2, 2009. A special primary to fill his vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7. John Fritchey, a candidate for that seat, said at a forum that Emanuel <b>had</b> <b>told</b> him he {{may be interested in}} running for the seat again in the future.|$|E
5|$|Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC is an American music {{publishing}} company owned by Sony through Sony Entertainment. The company was founded as {{a division of}} Associated Television (ATV) in 1955 by Lew Grade. In 1985, Michael Jackson acquired ATV Music Publishing for $47.5million. Paul McCartney, who <b>had</b> <b>told</b> Jackson {{about the importance of}} owning publishing, admitted he felt somewhat undercut by the purchase, because ATV Music Publishing owned the publishing rights to most of The Beatles' songs, although he did not enter the bidding when it came up for sale in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The Allies became {{sufficiently}} {{disturbed by}} German plots revolving around the Duke that President Roosevelt ordered covert surveillance of the Duke and Duchess when they visited Palm Beach, Florida, in April 1941. Duke Carl Alexander of Württemberg (then a monk in an American monastery) <b>had</b> <b>told</b> the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the Duchess {{had slept with}} the German ambassador in London, Joachim von Ribbentrop, in 1936, had remained in constant contact with him, and had continued to leak secrets.|$|E

5|$|The {{computer}} game for this series became Grabbit Rabbit which involved guiding 'Warren the Rabbit' down a course collecting carrots whilst dodging obstacles such as fences and bushes. Ball later {{said in an}} interview that Blake Harrison of The Inbetweeners <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her that he had once been a player on Grabbit Rabbit when he was younger. Blobby's game also now became known as Blobby's Office Trolley which saw him as a postman for the BBC with viewers having to guess which celebrity a letter was for.|$|E
5|$|The defence {{argued that}} Sheila was the killer, {{and that she}} did {{know how to handle}} guns, because she had been raised on a farm and had {{attended}} shoots when she was younger. She had a very serious mental illness, <b>had</b> <b>told</b> a psychiatrist she felt capable of killing her children, and the loaded rifle and cartridges had been left on the kitchen table by Bamber. There had been a recent family argument about placing the children in foster care.|$|E
5|$|The {{failures}} of these titles were further compounded by Atari's business dealings from 1981. Confident in strong sales, the company <b>had</b> <b>told</b> its distributors {{to place their}} 1982 orders all at once. However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, and distributors who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari. As a result, the company soon found itself in possession of several million essentially useless video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell.|$|E
