25|$|At {{the end of}} the First World War {{traffic was}} {{completely}} disorganized. In 1920 freight traffic recovers rapidly with the arrival of motorised barges. The HPLM company (Le Havre-Paris-Lyon-Marseille) operated 30 boats on the Canal du Midi. The Second World War saw a slowdown in traffic due to the shortage of oil but recovery was rapid after the conflict and the traffic reached 110 million tkm. However, the canal suffered from a size too small for later barges with high tonnage. Rail became more and more competitive and road transport also became a second competitor. The Canal du Midi became the third means of transport. Freight traffic ceased in the 1970s. In 1980 there were only two barges (the Bacchus, a wine carrier and the Espérance, a <b>grain</b> <b>carrier)</b> carrying regular traffic between Toulouse and Sète: they definitively ceased their activities in 1989 following the cessation of navigation pronounced by the Prefect of the Region due to drought. In 1991 operation of the canal was assigned to the administration of Voies navigables de France who remain managers today.|$|E

She was withdrawn from service in 1905 for a significant modernization. Upon returning to service in 1909, Italia was employed as a training ship. During the Italo-Turkish War of 191112, the ship provided fire support to Italian troops defending Tripoli in Libya. She was used as a floating battery at Brindisi after Italy entered World War I in 1915. The ship was rebuilt as a <b>grain</b> <b>carrier</b> in December 1917 [...] June 1918.

Italia was [...] on 1 June 1914 and stricken from the naval register three days later. Despite having all of her secondary guns removed, the ship was towed to Brindisi on 20 April 1915, shortly before Italy entered World War I, to defend the harbor. She was formally returned to the naval register on 23 May, the day Italy declared war on Austria Hungary, and was recommissioned on 1 June as a [...] "first class auxiliary". She remained at Brindisi until 16 December 1917, when she was taken to La Spezia for conversion into a <b>grain</b> <b>carrier,</b> retaining only two of her 4.7in guns. She was transferred initially to the Ministry of Transport on 1 June but was quickly reassigned to the State Railways on 27 July 1919. She remained there briefly, returning to the Navy on 13 January 1921. Italia was finally stricken on 16 November 1921 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E

40|$|Immobilization of brewing yeast onto a cellulosebased carrier {{obtained}} from spent grains, a brewing byproduct, by acid/base treatment {{has been studied}} in a continuously operating bubble-column reactor. The aim of this work was to study the mechanisms of brewing yeast immobilization onto spent grain particles through the information on physicochemical surface properties of brewing yeast and spent grain particles. Three mechanisms of brewing yeast immobilization onto spent <b>grains</b> <b>carrier</b> were proposed: cell-carrier adhesion, cell-cell attachment, and cell adsorption (accumulation) inside natural shelters (carrier’s surface roughness). The possibility of stable cell-carrier adhesion regarding the free energy of interaction was proved and {{the relative importance of}} longrange forces (Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory) and interfacial free energies was discussed. As for the cell-cell attachment leading to a multilayer yeast immobilization, a physicochemical interaction through localized hydrophobic regions on cell surface was hypothesized. However, neither flocculation nor chain formation mechanism can be excluded so far. The adsorption of brewing yeast inside sufficiently large crevices (pores) was documented with photomicrographs. A positive effect of higher dilution rate and increased hydrophobicity of base-treated spent grains on the yeast immobilization rate has also been found.
