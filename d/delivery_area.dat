25|$|Bulk mail is {{mail that}} is {{prepared}} for bulk mailing, often by presorting, and processing at reduced rates. It is often used in direct marketing and other advertising mail, although it has other uses as well. The senders of these messages sometimes purchase lists of addresses (which are sometimes targeted towards certain demographics) and then send letters advertising their product or service to all recipients. Other times, commercial solicitations are sent by local companies advertising local products, like a restaurant delivery service advertising to their <b>delivery</b> <b>area</b> or a retail store sending their weekly advertising circular to a general area. Bulk mail is also often sent to companies' existing subscriber bases, advertising new products or services.|$|E

30|$|The {{provision}} of on-street <b>delivery</b> <b>areas.</b> Street space was redesigned to better accommodate on-street <b>delivery</b> <b>areas,</b> and new rules were created for their use. The dimensions for these <b>delivery</b> <b>areas</b> were modulated {{based on the}} type and quantity of stores along the street, and by the stores’ needs. Home <b>delivery</b> <b>areas</b> every 100  m were also incorporated into residential streets. Discussion {{on the use of}} <b>delivery</b> <b>areas</b> began because, more than half the time, these areas were used for illegal parking. French traffic laws allow any vehicle to use delivery bays, but for loading and unloading only. Traffic enforcement personnel {{have no way of knowing}} whether or not a loading/unloading operation is under way. To eliminate this ambiguity, partners agreed to limit the use of <b>delivery</b> <b>areas</b> to 30 minutes. This limit is enforced with a ‘parking disc’. This is a time setter that lorry drivers must use to identify the time of their arrival. Over 100, 000 of these were manufactured by the city and distributed by freight organizations to their members. A 2008 survey showed that the new strategy resulted in a better availability of delivery bays during the day. Long term parking on the bays decreased. Enforcement has increased considerably, with 13 % of illegal stops fined in 2008 versus only 1 % in 2004.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis chapter {{presents}} the results of a project known as Aires de Livraison du Futur (ALF) conducted by three academic research teams namely, LIRIS SILEX, LIRIS GrAMA and LET, two SMEs- Interface Transport and SEMCO, one large group-Volvo and a local authority-Grand Lyon. Delivery services are increasing due to just-in-time management, the development of e-commerce and the emergence of new customer behaviors. <b>Delivery</b> <b>areas</b> were created to improve delivery drivers' work, decrease congestion and facilitate freight delivery to professional and private customers. The just-in-time service ensures the requirements of each customer are met by providing the type and quantity of goods when and as they need them. The chapter develops the following three main solutions to the problem, namely SyGAL, Guided CESNA and CEMAVIL. The Guided CESNA is based on dynamic negotiation of <b>delivery</b> <b>areas</b> between agents, where agents represent drivers, and <b>delivery</b> <b>areas</b> represent resources to be shared...|$|R

5000|$|These non-trivial multivalued {{dependencies}} on a non-superkey {{reflect the}} fact that the varieties of pizza a restaurant offers are independent from the areas to which the restaurant delivers.

40|$|Transportation CO 2 {{emissions}} {{are expected to}} increase in the following decades, and thus, new and better alternatives to reduce {{emissions are}} needed. Road transport emissions are explained by different factors, such as the type of vehicle, delivery operation and driving style. Because different cities may have conditions that are characterized by diversity in landforms, congestion, driving styles, etc., the importance of assigning the proper vehicle to serve a particular region within the city provides alternatives to reduce CO 2 emissions. In this article, we propose a new methodology that results in assigning trucks to deliver in areas such that the CO 2 emissions are minimized. Our methodology clusters the <b>delivery</b> <b>areas</b> based {{on the performance of}} the vehicle fleet by using the k-means algorithm and Tukey’s method. The output is then used to define the optimal CO 2 truck-area assignment. We illustrate the proposed approach for a parcel company that operates in Mexico City and demonstrate that it is a practical alternative to reduce transportation CO 2 emissions by matching vehicle type with <b>delivery</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
