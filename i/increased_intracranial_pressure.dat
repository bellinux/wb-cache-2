5|$|Idiopathic {{intracranial}} hypertension (IIH) {{is a condition}} characterized by <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> (pressure around the brain) without a detectable cause. The main symptoms are headache, vision problems, ringing in the ears with the heartbeat, and shoulder pain. Complications may include vision loss.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{can also}} be performed to measure the intracranial pressure, which might be increased in certain types of hydrocephalus. However, a lumbar puncture should never be performed if <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> is suspected due to certain situations such as a tumour, because {{it can lead to}} fatal brain herniation.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of poisoning by A. ocreata are initially gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea and vomiting which may lead to dehydration and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid-base disturbances. The initial symptoms resolve {{two to three days}} after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood. Renal failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic renal damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> intracranial hemorrhage, sepsis, pancreatitis, acute renal failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Brain tissue swelling, {{known as}} {{cerebral}} oedema, results from brain injury and other traumatic head injuries that can <b>increase</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> (ICP). Negatively charged molecules within cells create a fixed charge density, which <b>increases</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> through the Donnan effect. ATP pumps maintain a negative membrane potential even though negative charges leak across the membrane; this action establishes a chemical and electrical gradient.|$|R
40|$|Mean {{arterial}} <b>pressure</b> and <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> {{were measured}} serially in six infants with <b>intracranial</b> hypertension (<b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> greater than 20 mm Hg), and cerebral perfusion pressure was calculated from their difference. Overall, mean arterial <b>pressure</b> <b>increased</b> with rising <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> at a mean rate of 0. 20 mm Hg/mm Hg. This caused a fall in cerebral perfusion <b>pressure</b> with <b>increasing</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> at a mean rate of 0. 80 mm Hg/mm Hg overall, although cerebral perfusion pressure was well maintained in one infant. Thus {{the rise in}} blood pressure was usually insufficient {{to compensate for the}} <b>increase</b> in <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b> In infants with acute encephalopathy vigorous blood pressure support is as important as lowering <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure...</b>|$|R
40|$|Changes in {{cerebral}} {{blood flow}} with <b>increasing</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> were studied in anaesthetized baboons during expansion of a subdural balloon {{in one of two}} different sites. With an infratentorial balloon, {{cerebral blood flow}} bore no clear relation to <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> but was linearly related to cerebral perfusion pressure. Apart from an initial change in some animals, cerebrovascular resistance remained constant with <b>increasing</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> and autoregulation appeared to be lost from the outset. With a supratentorial balloon, cerebral blood flow remained constant as <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> was <b>increased</b> to levels around 60 mm Hg, corresponding to a cerebral perfusion pressure range of approximately 100 to 40 mmHg. Cerebrovascular resistance fell progressively, and autoregulation appeared to be effective during this phase. At higher <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> levels (lower cerebral perfusion pressure levels), autoregulation was lost and cerebral blood flow became directly dependent on cerebral perfusion pressure. The importance of the cause of the <b>increase</b> in <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> on the response of the cerebral circulation and the relevance of these findings to the clinical situation are discussed...|$|R
5|$|Death caps {{have been}} {{reported}} to taste pleasant. This, coupled with the delay in the appearance of symptoms—during which time internal organs are being severely, sometimes irreparably, damaged—makes it particularly dangerous. Initially, symptoms are gastrointestinal in nature and include colicky abdominal pain, with watery diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, which may lead to dehydration if left untreated, and, in severe cases, hypotension, tachycardia, hypoglycemia, and acid–base disturbances. These first symptoms resolve two to three days after the ingestion. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—jaundice, diarrhea, delirium, seizures, and coma due to fulminant liver failure and attendant hepatic encephalopathy caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substance in the blood. Kidney failure (either secondary to severe hepatitis or caused by direct toxic kidney damage) and coagulopathy may appear during this stage. Life-threatening complications include <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> intracranial bleeding, pancreatic inflammation, acute kidney failure, and cardiac arrest. Death generally occurs six to sixteen days after the poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as a plastic surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it is merely the side effects of <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b> By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with the telltale rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to dig into his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing him out of his area of expertise.|$|E

25|$|A lumbar {{puncture}} is a procedure in which cerebral spinal fluid {{is removed from}} the spine with a needle. A {{lumbar puncture}} is necessary to look for infection or blood in the spinal fluid. A lumbar puncture can also evaluate the pressure in the spinal column, which can be useful for people with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (usually young, obese women who have <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure),</b> or other causes of <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b> In most cases, a CT scan should be done first.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{details the}} results of {{experimental}} studies, on 16 dogs with artificially-induced intracranial space-occupying lesions, of the systemic vascular responses and the <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> changes (both in the supratentorial and infratentorial compartments) induced by <b>increasing</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b> The changes produced {{were divided into two}} phases such that phase 1 detailed the alterations observed {{from the start of the}} balloon inflation up to the initiation of the systemic pressor response. Phase 2 recorded those alterations which occurred during, and immediately after, the period of systemic hypertension (see Fitch et al., 1977). The changes observed during phase 1, and presented in this communication, were those of <b>increasing</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressures</b> and decreasing mean arterial pressure and heart rate. These alterations were associated with decreases in supratentorial perfusion pressure and increases in transtentorial pressure gradient and arrhythmia index...|$|R
50|$|Intracranial {{hemorrhage}} is {{a serious}} medical emergency because the buildup of blood within the skull can lead to <b>increases</b> in <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> which can crush delicate brain tissue or limit its blood supply.

30|$|Introduction: Critically ill {{patients}} sometimes need laparoscopic surgery. It {{has been reported}} that steeped head-down position could <b>increase</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> during robotic surgery. But we don´t know whether mild Trendelenburg position and carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum cause intracranial hypertension. We conducted a prospective observational study.|$|R
25|$|It {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of glaucoma, drug-induced edema, heart failure-induced edema, epilepsy and in reducing intraocular pressure after surgery. It has also been used in {{the treatment}} of altitude sickness, Ménière's disease, <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> and neuromuscular disorders.|$|E
25|$|The early {{physical}} effects of obesity in adolescence include, {{almost all of}} the child’s organs being affected, gallstones, hepatitis, sleep apnoea and <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b> Overweight children {{are also more likely to}} grow up to be overweight adults. Obesity during adolescence has been found to increase mortality rates during adulthood.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no {{absolute}} contraindications for ECT, there is increased risk for patients who have unstable or severe cardiovascular conditions or aneurysms; who have recently had a stroke; who have <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> (for instance, due to a solid brain tumor), or who have severe pulmonary conditions, or who are generally {{at high risk for}} receiving anesthesia.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{measures}} can include rest, caffeine intake (via coffee or intravenous infusion), and hydration. Corticosteroids may provide transient relief for some patients. An abdominal binder — {{a type of}} garment that <b>increases</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> by compressing the abdomen — can temporarily relieve symptoms for some people.|$|R
50|$|Patients {{are advised}} to treat with bed rest and {{avoiding}} activities that <b>increase</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> (i.e. weightlifting, valsalva, scuba diving, flying in airplanes) with the hopes of the membrane healing on their own. Appropriate Physical therapy / vestibular rehabilitation techniques {{can be helpful in}} managing symptoms of movement sensitivity.|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{intracerebral}} hemorrhage (SICH) {{is responsible}} for 10 %- 15 % of the acute stroke. Hematoma or the occlusion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow by ventricular clotting can result in obstructive hydrocephalus, <b>increasing</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> which needs urgent decompression. We report our results of management of spontaneous deep cerebral hematoma by endoscopic approach...|$|R
25|$|EEG {{can also}} be used in {{intensive}} care units for brain function monitoring to monitor for non-convulsive seizures/non-convulsive status epilepticus, to monitor the effect of sedative/anesthesia in patients in medically induced coma (for treatment of refractory seizures or <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure),</b> and to monitor for secondary brain damage in conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (currently a research method).|$|E
25|$|Mannitol {{is a type}} {{of sugar}} alcohol which is also used as a medication. As a sugar, it is often used as a {{sweetener}} in diabetic food, as it is poorly absorbed from the intestines. As a medication, it is used to decrease high pressures in the eyes, seen in glaucoma, and to lower <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b> Medically, it is given by injection. Effects typically begin within 15 minutes and last up to 8 hours.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of a {{subdural}} hematoma {{depends on}} its size and rate of growth. Some small subdural hematomas can be managed by careful monitoring until the body heals itself. Other small subdural hematomas can be managed by inserting a temporary small catheter through a hole drilled through the skull and sucking out the hematoma; this procedure can {{be done at the}} bedside. Large or symptomatic hematomas require a craniotomy, the surgical opening of the skull. A surgeon then opens the dura, removes the blood clot with suction or irrigation, and identifies and controls sites of bleeding. Postoperative complications include <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> brain edema, new or recurrent bleeding, infection, and seizure. The injured vessels must be repaired.|$|E
50|$|When anosmia {{is caused}} by {{inflammatory}} changes in the nasal passageways, it is treated simply by reducing inflammation. It {{can be caused by}} chronic meningitis and neurosyphilis that would <b>increase</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> {{over a long period of}} time, and in some cases by ciliopathy including ciliopathy due to primary ciliary dyskinesia (Kartagener syndrome, Afzelius' syndrome or Siewert's syndrome).|$|R

50|$|Impaired venous outflow {{is often}} {{caused by a}} hypoplastic jugular foramen. This causes an <b>increase</b> in the <b>intracranial</b> blood volume, thereby causing an <b>increase</b> in <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
500|$|Nerves may be {{compressed}} {{because of}} <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure,</b> a mass effect of an intracerebral haemorrhage, or tumour that presses against the nerves and {{interferes with the}} transmission of impulses along the nerve. [...] A loss of functionality of a single cranial nerve may sometimes be the first symptom of an intracranial or skull base cancer.|$|E
500|$|The terms [...] "benign" [...] and [...] "pseudotumor" [...] {{derive from}} the fact that <b>increased</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> may be {{associated}} with brain tumors. Those patients in whom no tumour was found were therefore diagnosed with [...] "pseudotumor cerebri" [...] (a disease mimicking a brain tumor). The disease was renamed benign intracranial hypertension in 1955 to distinguish it from intracranial hypertension due to life-threatening diseases (such as cancer); however, this was also felt to be misleading because any disease that can blind someone should not be thought of as benign, and the name was therefore revised in 1989 to [...] "idiopathic (of no identifiable cause) intracranial hypertension".|$|E

40|$|Pressure {{changes within}} the venous outflow tract {{from the brain}} were studied in anaesthetized baboons. Segmental {{vascular}} resistance changes were also calculated and the results correlated with the changes in cerebral blood flow, measured by the 133 Xenon clearance method. Three different methods were used to raise intracranial pressure: cisterna magna infusion, a supratentorial subdural balloon, and an infratentorial subdural balloon. A close correlation {{was found between the}} cortical vein <b>pressure</b> and <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> with all methods of raising intracranial pressure: the overall correlation coefficient was 0 · 98. In the majority of animals sagittal sinus pressure showed little change through a wide range of <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b> In three of the six animals in the cisterna magna infusion group, however, sagittal sinus pressure increased to levels approaching the <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> during the later stages of intracranial hypertension. Jugular venous pressure showed little change with <b>increasing</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b> The relationship between cerebral prefusion pressure and cerebral blood flow differed according to the method of <b>increasing</b> <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure.</b> This was due to differing patterns of change in prevenous vascular resistance as venous resistance increased progressively with increasing pressure in all three groups. The present results confirm, therefore, the validity of the current definition of cerebral perfusion pressure—that is, cerebral perfusion pressure is equal to mean arterial <b>pressure</b> minus mean <b>intracranial</b> pressure—by demonstrating that <b>intracranial</b> <b>pressure</b> does represent the effective cerebral venous outflow pressure...|$|R
