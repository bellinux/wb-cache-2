It is interesting to single out the controlling factors for participation in or absence from the labour market after 50 and the link between poor health and occupational status. The prevalence of functional limitations in everyday activities leads to a more pronounced exclusion of the over- 50 s from the labour market. Some of those aged between 55 and 59 on disability benefits become unemployed and do not look for work, in other words they are potentially exempted from job-seeking.

40|$|The {{disabling}} {{nature and}} lifelong impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) imposes considerable socioeconomic burden despite its relative low prevalence {{compared to other}} chronic diseases. This is the first study of MS in the Slovak Republic that provides information about healthcare and social expenditures including costs of productivity loss caused by reduced work capacity of patients with MS. Retrospectively direct and indirect costs of MS were investigated by prevalence based “bottom-up” approach. The societal and health insurance perspective was used to perform the overall economic burden caused by MS in Slovakia. The human capital method {{was used for the}} calculation of indirect costs, as this is the most common method applied in published studies. As not all detailed data on expenditures were available, the missing data were collected in the retrospective patient research. Total annual costs in 2010 for 6. 100 dispensed patients with MS in Slovakia were € 54. 723. 592. Indirect costs (€ 31. 728. 757) prevailed over direct costs (€ 22. 994. 834). The highest part of both costs were € 25. 207. 512 and € 12. 641. 052 for loss productivity due to patients sickness and <b>invalidity</b> <b>pensions</b> and disease-modifying drugs respectively. The average cost per patient independently of disease severity was € 8. 971. MS causes a high economic burden, with a strong predominance of indirect costs. Documenting and quantifying this burden among patients with MS in different disease stages through cost-of-illness study can lead to better disease management and it can provide valuable information for future cost analysis and for decision-making process. </p...|$|R
25|$|Under Olof Palme's premiership tenure, matters {{concerned}} with child care centers, social security, {{protection of the}} elderly, accident safety, and housing problems received special attention. Under Palme the public health system in Sweden became efficient, with the infant mortality rate standing at 12 per 1,000 live births. An ambitious redistributive programme was carried out, with special help provided to the disabled, immigrants, the low paid, single-parent families, and the old. The Swedish welfare state was significantly expanded from a position already {{one of the most}} far-reaching in the world during his time in office. As noted by Isabela Mares, {{during the first half of}} the Seventies “the level of benefits provided by every subsystem of the welfare state improved significantly.” Various policy changes increased the basic old-age pension replacement rate from 42% of the average wage in 1969 to 57%, while a health care reform carried out in 1974 integrated all health services and increased the minimum replacement rate from 64% to 90% of earnings. In 1974, supplementary unemployment assistance was established, providing benefits to those workers ineligible for existing benefits. In 1971, eligibility for <b>invalidity</b> <b>pensions</b> was extended with greater opportunities for employees over the age of 60. In 1974, universal dental insurance was introduced, and former maternity benefits were replaced by a parental allowance. In 1974, housing allowances for families with children were raised and these allowances were extended to other low-income groups. Childcare centres were also expanded under Palme, and separate taxation of husband and wife introduced. Access to pensions for older workers in poor health was liberalised in 1970, and a disability pension was introduced for older unemployed workers in 1972.|$|R
50|$|In social policy, {{a number}} of {{progressive}} reforms were realised during Spaak's first premiership. An Act of June 1938 “increased {{the functions of the}} National Society for Cheap Houses and Dwellings and empowered it, under State guarantee, to contract a loan of 350 million francs,” while a Royal Decree of July 1938 laid down the rules of applying the provisions of a Holidays with Pay Act passed in 1936 to agricultural, horticultural and forestry undertakings. An Act of the 20th of August 1938 amended and supplemented a Holidays with Pay Act previously passed in 1936 by extending its coverage to all undertakings, whatever their number of wage earners, as well as to home workers. The Act also removed a previous requirement in which a wage earner had to work {{for at least a year}} with the same employer in order to earn an annual holiday. An Act of the 8th of July 1938 amended the miners' old-age, invalidity and survivors' insurance scheme by increasing the benefits payable to invalids, aged persons and widows already in receipt of a pension, while also significantly widening the conditions for the grant of <b>invalidity</b> <b>pensions.</b> An Order of the 25th of August 1938 prohibited the use of so-called motor spirit “for greasing, cleaning (hands) etc.,” while a Royal Order of the 27th of August 1938 fixed normal weekly hours of actual work in the ship-repairing industry in Antwerp at 42 hours “distributed over the seven days of the week.” A Royal Order of the 27th of December 1938 extended the scope of an eight-hour Act passed in June 1921 to cover technical staff employed in cinemas, and a Royal Order of the 22nd of December 1938 amended the entries in the second column of the schedule (list of occupations) which was now brought into conformity with Convention No.42, and added “in the case of pneumoconiosis, sand-blasting processes in iron and steel foundries.|$|R

40|$|After {{stabilising}} in {{the years}} after 1995, the Austrian social expenditure ratio went up again, albeit slightly, in 1999. As reported by the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS) used by the EU, Austria spent ATS 781 billion (€ 56. 8 million) on social security in 1999, which translated into a growth of 4. 9 percent over the previous year, whereas nominal GDP rose by just 3. 5 percent. In terms of GDP, the social expenditure ratio, at 28. 9 percent, thus was 0. 4 percentage points higher than in 1998. Almost half of the social expenditure (47. 6 percent) was spent on old age and survivors' pensions; 26. 2 percent went to health spending, whereas expenditure on families, at 10. 4 percent, was the third-largest segment in social expenditure. Another 8. 8 percent was paid out as <b>invalidity</b> <b>pensions</b> to people below the age of 60. The remaining 5. 5 percent were expenditures on active and passive labour market policies, rounded off by 1. 6 percent in other expenditures. In comparison with the previous year an above-average growth was found for expenditure on families (7. 7 percent), health (6. 4 percent) and invalidity (6. 1 percent). The increase was even more substantial for the "other expenditures" item (20. 3 percent). These include social assistance paid by the states, benefits in kind rendered at local government level, housing assistance and other benefits to prevent marginalisation. The growth shown by old-age and survivors pensions and unemployment was less pronounced than the overall rise in expenditure on social security. In a European comparison, the Austrian social expenditure ratio of 1998 (social expenditure for 1999 reported in line with the ESSPROS system is not yet available for the EU), is 0. 8 percentage points above the EU- 15 average of 27. 7 percent. In Sweden, France, Denmark and Germany, the ratio was higher than in Austria. Broken down by function groups, deviations from the EU average were found for old age and survivors' pensions and in children and family benefits. In each of these sectors, Austria spends 1. 4 percentage points more, whereas its expenditure on unemployment, housing and efforts to prevent social marginalisation is lower than the EU- 15 average.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the European System of Integrated Social Protection Statistics (ESSPROS), {{developed}} by the Statistical Office of the European Community, social expenditure for all EU-countries have been newly recorded on a standardized base, thereby enabling meaningful comparative analysis. According to this new system, Austrian social expenditure in 1995 totaled ATS 694 billion, equivalent to 29. 5 percent of GDP. Since 1980, current social protection expenditure rose by 157 percent and as a ratio of GDP by 2 ½ percentage points. During the 1980 's, changes in the social outlays/GDP ratio were dominated by cyclical variations: it rose over the period of sluggish growth until 1987, but fell back with the subsequent recovery – eventually even below the 1980 level. In the early 1990 's however, it ratcheted upwards, due to a number of discretionary raises in benefits such as an extension of paid maternity leave higher pension entitlements for women, family tax credits and nursing care benefits. In 1995, the rise in the social expenditure/GDP ratio leveled off, despite a cyclical weakening accompanied by a rise in unemployment. Also in 1996, the ratio may have remained flat in view of measures to cut the government deficit. Since 1980, the expenditure components showing the strongest increase are unemployment benefits (+ 660 percent rise) and <b>invalidity</b> <b>pensions</b> (+ 225 percent). Old-age pension outlays (+ 175 percent) also expanded above-average because of discretionary benefit increases and the system maturing (with new retires having acquired progressively longer entitlement periods). The relative importance of social expenditure in Austria is similar to that in other European countries with comparable economic and social structure. As a proportion of GDP, it is slightly above the EU-average for 1994, which is dampened by the absence of Sweden (prior to accession) and the very low level of social spending in the southern European countries. For the EU as a whole, the ratio has moved up by 4 ¼ percentage points since 1980; apart from a catching-up effect in southern Europe, strong advances in the U. K. (+ 6 percentage points), Denmark and France (+ 5 points each) have contributed to this development. The structural composition of social outlays in Austria differs markedly from the EU-average insofar, as old-age pensions (Austria 49 percent, EU 44 percent) and family subsidies (11 versus 8 percent) claim a much larger share, whereas the share of spending on unemployment benefits (6 against 9 percent) as well as on sickness and invalidity payments (33 versus 35 percent) is distinctly lower in Austria than on the average of EU countries.

50|$|Finland's first {{national}} old-age pension plan dates from 1937, {{but it was}} so poorly funded that a new National Pensions Act was put into effect in 1957. In the late 1980s, this law, somewhat reformed, was still the basis of Finland's National Pension Plan, which was open to all residents over the age of sixteen, even to those who had never paid into it. Even those foreigners not from the Nordic countries were entitled to this pension if they had resided in Finland for at least five years. Those who left for residence in a country outside Nordic Europe, even those who were Finnish citizens, could receive the pension for only one year. The flat-rate national pension could be paid as an old-age pension, once a person reached the age of sixtyfive; as an <b>invalidity</b> <b>pension</b> (either full or partial) to those between the ages of sixteen and sixty-four who were no longer able to work; or, in some cases, to the long-term unemployed who were in their late fifties or early sixties.

40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the coordinated {{rehabilitation}}. Coordinated rehabilitation is a coherent process of medical, educational, vocational and social rehabilitation, whose main objective is to minimalize the consequences, based on the individual's disability. Successful rehabilitation consists in ensuring early, continuous and coordinated efforts of the fastest and widest participation of persons with disabilities in the usual activities of life. The theoretical part consists of six basic chapters. The first one {{is devoted to the}} International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, which is followed by the subchapter dealing with disabilities and consequently mental disabilities. I have focused on people with mental disabilities, as an organization where research was conducted, providing services to these people. The second chapter contains information about coordinated rehabilitation. The remaining chapters deal with the individual components of a coordinated rehabilitation, which are medical, educational, vocational and social rehabilitation. The aims of this thesis is to determine how the system of coordinated rehabilitation is used in the Institute of social care Domečky. A partial aim is to determine the importance of a system of coordinated rehabilitation for clients of the Institute of social care Domečky. There are two research questions in the connection with the thesis aims. The main research question is: How are the individual components of a coordinated rehabilitation applied in the Institute of social care Domečky? The particular research question finds positives provides system of coordinated rehabilitation for clients of the Institute of social care Domečky. Qualitative research was chosen for the practical section of the thesis.
