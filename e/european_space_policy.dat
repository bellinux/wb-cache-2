40|$|Summary]. The Wider Europe has {{now become}} a {{prominent}} feature in European foreign policy discourse, prompted by the need for the enlarging EU to define its future relations with the rest of Europe and the arc of Arab-Islamic states to its south and east. The EU’s first policy documents on this subject, however, have been thin in substance, mainly seeking to develop more active bilateral relations with countries such as Ukraine and Moldova. Yet {{at the same time the}} EU is discussing bilaterally just with Russia a set of common <b>European</b> <b>policy</b> <b>spaces</b> that should be at the heart of a Wider Europe policy. It is therefore argued in this paper that the EU should adopt a systematic approach to defining a complete set of seven common <b>European</b> <b>policy</b> <b>spaces,</b> with multilateral institutional developments to match, thus bringing together the bilateral and multilateral approaches. The overarching institutional mechanism should be through transforming the present very weak ‘European Conference’ into a seriously structured ‘Pan-European Conference’, led by a Coordinating Group consisting of the EU, Russia and a few other rotating places for non-EU states, with institutionalised linkages to the Council of Europe and other European multilateral organisations for the specific common <b>policy</b> <b>spaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article pleads for a {{systemic}} approach to <b>European</b> <b>policy</b> <b>spaces</b> formation. The termmutual transformation {{is used to}} underline three observations concerning how Europeanpolicy spaces are formed: 1) influence among the levels composing the Union runssimultaneously from Brussels to the lower levels, from the lower levels to the EUauthorities, and from country to country; 2) sources of change are both exogenous andendogenous; 3) {{the nature of the}} policies under study and the issues and interestsassociated with them evolve over time, affecting the identities of the different-level actors andtheir ties. The case of drug licensing is used to illustrate the usefulness of this approach. Tocome to grips with the complexity of the processes explaining the creation of a Europeanpolicy space for medicines, we emphasize the role played by three closely interrelatedmechanisms: competition, cooperation and the transformation of relations between expertiseand policy-making. <b>European</b> public <b>space...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} I test spatial models of European Union (EU) {{legislative}} decision-making regarding the dimensionality of the <b>policy</b> <b>space.</b> After clarifying {{the concept of}} dimensionality, I review the existing literature. I then map out possible ways to test these models based on different dimensionality assumptions. Using quantitative data on actor positions for EU legislative politics, I first employ dimension-reducing techniques. The results show that this technique is not appropriate for generating a decreased number of underlying dimensions for the data at hand and that a one- or two-dimensional <b>European</b> <b>policy</b> <b>space</b> cannot be detected. Shifting to more theory-based analysis, I calculate the predicted outcomes for voting models of the EU under different spatial configurations. The findings show that the formal models' predictive power increases {{with the use of}} multi-dimensional <b>policy</b> <b>spaces.</b> I conclude by interpreting these findings in the light of a more general debate on evaluating the decision space assumed by models of group decision-making...|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{research}} on the <b>European</b> <b>policy</b> <b>space</b> in education has been conducted {{from a number of}} different perspectives. One focus is the constitution of a new intergovernmental arena including new discourses, new forms of deliberation and decision making, shifts from government to governance, challenges regarding legitimacy and representation and emerging tensions and contradictions (Dale & Robertson, 2009). Another perspective is the understanding of Europe as an assemblage of diverse interactions, discourses, associations, expertise and (hybrid) identities that constitutes a transnational space of governing education (Lawn & Grek, 2012). Much {{attention has been paid to}} decentralisation, deregulation and new modalities of privatization and marketization of education, but less focus on how these processes and policies are actually played out in education. For instance the role of old and new commercial actors, the new partnerships and their commercial logic of operation, and how new strategies of governing take shape has been little dealt with. In other words, the <b>European</b> <b>policy</b> <b>space</b> is rarely approached by explicitly addressing the creation and functioning of a commercial and a related financial space in education. Moreover such direction of analyisis implies not only considering the ‘hows’ but also exploring the often missing question of ‘why’. This means to address the nexus between education, the wider financial dynamics of capital and “the neo-liberalising of the State” (Ball, 2012, p. 29) The contributions collected in this issue take up this challenge. Before introducing the contributions, we attempt to discuss some general issues related to privatisation and commercialisation in the governing of education: theoretical and methodological considerations, conceptual clarifications and finally possible themes and topics for study but also for further (public) debate...|$|R

Critical discourse analysis of four key policy documents reveals how understanding the governing power of comparative knowledge involves considering dynamics originating from multiple spaces and times. While international comparative logic within England’s National Curriculum could {{be regarded as a}} manifestation of a European-wide governing technology, the article suggests that the distinctiveness of ‘Europe’ is at risk of being lost to dominant global knowledge paradigms which are also {{an integral part of the}} ‘governance by comparison’ process...|$|R
