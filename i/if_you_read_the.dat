5|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> {{records of}} the Royal Society {{and what they were}} doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. I certainly don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2002, Adam Gilchrist, {{speaking}} at a Carlton (Australian) Football Club luncheon, claimed Muralitharan's action does not comply with the laws of cricket. The Melbourne-based Age newspaper quoted Gilchrist as saying."Yeah, I think he does (chuck), and I say that because, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> laws of the game, there's {{no doubt in my}} mind that he and many others, throughout cricket history have." [...] These comments were made before the doosra controversy, in spite of Muralitharan's action having been cleared by ICC in both 1996 and 1999. For his comment Gilchrist was reprimanded by the Australian Cricket Board (ACB) and found guilty of being in breach of ACB rules concerned with [...] "detrimental public comment".|$|E

2500|$|Shortly {{before his}} death in 1980, Lennon commented that [...] "Although the lyrics don't resolve into any sense, they're good lines. They {{certainly}} work ... but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> whole song, it doesn't say anything" [...] and added the song was [...] "beautiful – and I never wished I'd written it." [...] Lennon made reference to [...] "Yesterday" [...] in his song [...] "How Do You Sleep?" [...] on his 1971 album Imagine. The song appears to attack McCartney with the line [...] "The only thing you done was yesterday, but since you've gone you're just another day", a reference to McCartney's recent hit [...] "Another Day". At the 2006 Grammy Awards, McCartney performed [...] "Yesterday" [...] live as a mash-up with Linkin Park and Jay Z's [...] "Numb/Encore".|$|E
2500|$|The word robotics, used to {{describe}} this field of study, was coined by the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov. Asimov created the [...] "Three Laws of Robotics" [...] which are a recurring theme in his books. These have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction. (The three laws are pure fiction, and no technology yet created {{has the ability to}} understand or follow them, and in fact most robots serve military purposes, which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law. [...] "People think about Asimov's laws, but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn't work. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> short stories, every single one is about a failure, and they are totally impractical," [...] said Dr. Joanna Bryson of the University of Bath.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On the Road {{has been}} the object of {{critical}} study since its publication. [...] David Brooks of The New York Times compiled several opinions and summarized them in an Op-Ed from October 2, 2007. Whereas Millstein {{saw it as a}} story in which the heroes took pleasure in everything, George Mouratidis, an editor of a new edition, claimed [...] "above all else, the story is about loss." [...] "It's a book about death and the search for something meaningful to hold on to—the famous search for 'IT,' a truth larger than the self, which, of course, is never found," [...] wrote Meghan O'Rourke in Slate. [...] "Kerouac was this deep, lonely, melancholy man," [...] Hilary Holladay of the University of Massachusetts Lowell told The Philadelphia Inquirer. [...] "And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> book closely, you see that sense of loss and sorrow swelling on every page." [...] "In truth, 'On the Road' is a book of broken dreams and failed plans," [...] wrote Ted Gioia in The Weekly Standard.|$|E

60|$|Now {{he calls}} to their mind {{some of their}} eminent {{passages}} of his life, and eats and drinks in their presence, and opens the scriptures to them: yea, and opens their understanding too, that their hearing might not be unprofitable to them; all which continued from {{early in the morning}} till late at night. Oh! what a manna day was this to the church. And more than all this <b>you</b> will find, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> but <b>the</b> four evangelists upon this subject.|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> {{story of}} Micaiah the Prophet, and King Ahab in the 22d {{chapter of the}} 1st Book of Kings, you will, I think, agree that Ahab showed himself as foolish as he was wicked. He hated Micaiah for telling him the truth. And {{when he heard the}} truth and was warned of his coming end, he went stupidly to meet it, and died as the fool dies. Foolishness and wickedness often go hand in hand. Certainly they did in that miserable king's case.|$|E

[...] "Don't you remember that on the night when we dined together at the Maison Léon d'Or he sent one of his emissaries for me? He was a man in whom I had always felt the greatest, the most complete interest. I went to him gladly. Since then, as you will know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> papers, events have moved rapidly.

40|$|Extract: <b>If</b> <b>you</b> haven’t <b>read</b> <b>the</b> recent {{guidance}} on doctor-industry relationships, it’s certainly worth a look. Endorsed by leading professional groups, it argues that promising collaboration with industry “may be missed or even rejected” because of “misconceptions” arising from historical practices or rogue individuals. To {{set the record}} straight, the guidance emphasises the value of seeing sales representatives, the benefits of industry sponsored education, and the critical importance of health professionals serving on companies’ advisory boards...|$|R
40|$|This {{afternoon}} I {{will talk}} about business models because in open innovation they play a crucial role. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have <b>read</b> <b>the</b> books of Henry Chesbrough or other authors on open innovation, you know that business models are important in explaining the phenomenon of open innovation. Moreover, {{they are not only}} important for open innovation but also for open commercialization processes, that is the network of partners you need to launch the product once the innovation is completed...|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> {{old books}} of natural history, {{you will find}} they say that when the {{mongoose}} fights the snake and happens to get bitten, he runs off and eats some herb that cures him. That is not true. The victory {{is only a matter}} of quickness of eye and quickness of foot,--snake's blow against mongoose's jump,--and as no eye can follow the motion of a snake's head when it strikes, that makes things much more wonderful than any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he was a young mongoose, and it made him all the more pleased to think that he had managed to escape a blow from behind. It gave him confidence in himself, and when Teddy came running down the path, Rikki-tikki was ready to be petted.|$|E

[...] "My {{method is}} {{one which is}} doubtless altogether strange to you, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Lancet or the Medical Journal, you would have heard {{a good deal about}} it lately. I form my conclusions as to the mental condition of a patient almost altogether from a close inspection of their letters, or any work upon which they are, or have been, recently engaged. I do not say {{that it is possible to}} do this from a single letter, but when a man has a hobby, such as I understand Lord Deringham indulges in, and has devoted a great deal of time to real or imaginary work in connection with it, I am generally able, from a study of that work, to tell how far the brain is weakened, if at all, and in what manner it can be strengthened. This is only the crudest outline of my theory, but to be brief, I can give you my opinion as to Lord Deringham's mental condition, and my advice as to its maintenance, if you will place before me the latest work upon which he has been engaged. I hope I have made myself clear." ...|$|E
6000|$|In formulating any {{summary of}} Carlyle the critic must {{remember}} that he is dealing with a man of two sides, one prejudiced, dogmatic, jealous of rivals, the other roughly sincere. On either side Carlyle {{is a man of}} contradictions. For an odious dead despot like Frederick, who happens to please him, he turns criticism into eulogy; and for a living poet like Wordsworth he tempers praise by spiteful criticism. [Footnote: Carlyle's praise of Wordsworth's [...] "fine, wholesome rusticity" [...] is often quoted, but only in part. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> whole passage (in Reminiscences) you will find the effect of Carlyle's praise wholly spoiled by a heartless dissection of a poet, with whom, as Carlyle confessed, he had very slight acquaintance.] He writes a score of letters to show that his grief is too deep for words. He is voluble on [...] "the infinite virtue of silence." [...] He proclaims to-day that he [...] "will write no word on any subject till he has studied it to the bottom," [...] and to-morrow will pronounce judgment on America or science or some other matter of which he knows nothing. In all this Carlyle sees no inconsistency; he is sincere in either role, of prophet or stump speaker, and even thinks that humor is one of his prime qualities.|$|E
5000|$|However he {{apparently}} had a somewhat fractious relationship with Royal Shakespeare Director Peter Hall. He was Old Gobbo in The Merchant of Venice {{and when the}} set arrived Hall called all the cast into the theatre to view it. MacGowran was not there, still in his dressing room. An assistant was sent to fetch him. He returned alone: [...] "Mr MacGowran says, Mr. Hall, that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>read</b> <b>the</b> play <b>you</b> would know that Old Gobbo was blind." ...|$|R

[...] "But I may as well say beforehand, that I must decline the proposal it contains to pay a visit here. I trust I may be excused for desiring an interval of complete freedom from such distractions as have been hitherto inevitable, and especially from guests whose desultory vivacity makes their presence a fatigue." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{nature of}} current chutney songs are simple. They speak {{about life and}} love for many things, whether for a {{significant}} other or for an object of possession. Some chutney songs favor the topic of food or drink; however, like most West Indian music, {{there can be a}} hidden message found in <b>the</b> song <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> between <b>the</b> lines. Some chutney songs popularize the edible form of the chutney, such as Daniel Worm's [...] "Chutney, Chutney, Chutney" [...] remix made popular in the regional area of Konstanz, Germany.|$|R
6000|$|First. His {{presence}} is dreadful, and {{that not only}} his presence in common, but his special, yea, his most comfortable and joyous presence. When God comes to bring a soul news of mercy and salvation, even that visit, that presence of God, is fearful. When Jacob went from Beersheba towards Haran, he met with God in the way by a dream, in the which he apprehended a ladder set upon the earth, whose top reached to heaven; now in this dream, {{from the top of}} this ladder, he saw the Lord, and heard him speak unto him, not threateningly; not as having his fury come up into his face; but in the most sweet and gracious manner, saluting him with promise of goodness after promise of goodness, to the number of eight or nine; as will appear <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> place. Yet I say, when he awoke, all the grace that discovered itself in this heavenly vision to him could not keep him from dread and fear of God's majesty. [...] "And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not; and he was afraid and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven" [...] (Gen 28:10-17).|$|E
6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> old Chronicles of the French wars, {{you find}} {{precisely}} the same character of the Englishman, and Henry V.'s people behaved with just the cool domineering manner of our gallant veterans of France and the Peninsula. Did you never hear Colonel Cutler and Major Slasher talking over the war after dinner? or Captain Boarder describing his action with the 'Indomptable?' 'Hang the fellows,' says Boarder, 'their practice was very good. I was beat off three times before I took her.' 'Cuss those carabineers of Milhaud's,' says Slasher, 'what work they made of our light cavalry!' implying a sort of surprise that the Frenchman should stand up against Britons at all: a good-natured wonder that the blind, mad, vain-glorious, brave poor devils should actually {{have the courage to}} resist an Englishman. Legions of such Englishmen are patronizing Europe at this moment, being kind to the Pope, or good-natured to the King of Holland, or condescending to inspect the Prussian reviews. When Nicholas came here, who reviews {{a quarter of a million}} of pairs of moustaches to his breakfast every morning, we took him off to Windsor and showed him two whole regiments of six or eight hundred Britons a-piece, with an air as much as to say,--'There, my boy, look at THAT. Those are ENGLISHMEN, those are, and your master whenever you please,' as the nursery song says. The British Snob is long, long past scepticism, and can afford to laugh quite good-humouredly at those conceited Yankees, or besotted little Frenchmen, who set up as models of mankind. THEY forsooth! ...|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, it will be {{generally}} found that the popular joke is not true to the letter, but is true to the spirit. The vulgar joke is generally in the oddest way the truth and yet not the fact. For instance, {{it is not in}} the least true that mothers-in-law are as a class oppressive and intolerable; most of them are both devoted and useful. All the mothers-in-law I have ever had were admirable. Yet the legend of the comic papers is profoundly true. It draws {{attention to the fact that}} it is much harder to be a nice mother-in-law than to be nice in any other conceivable relation of life. The caricatures have drawn the worst mother-in-law a monster, by way of expressing the fact that the best mother-in-law is a problem. The same is true of the perpetual jokes in comic papers about shrewish wives and henpecked husbands. It is all a frantic exaggeration, but it is an exaggeration of a truth; whereas all the modern mouthings about oppressed women are the exaggerations of a falsehood. If you read even the best of the intellectuals of to-day you will find them saying that in the mass of the democracy the woman is the chattel of her lord, like his bath or his bed. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> comic literature of the democracy you will find that the lord hides under the bed to escape from the wrath of his chattel. This is not the fact, but it is much nearer the truth. Every man who is married knows quite well, not only that he does not regard his wife as a chattel, but that no man can conceivably ever have done so. The joke stands for an ultimate truth, and that is a subtle truth. It is one not very easy to state correctly. It can, perhaps, be most correctly stated by saying that, even if the man is the head of the house, he knows he is the figurehead.|$|E
5000|$|Of his {{commitment}} to contemporary music, Jacobs himself said this: 'I feel absolutely perplexed at times why performers don't feel {{at home with the}} music of their own century. The music that hit me first when I was an adolescent was the music of the beginning of the century, all the way up through Stravinsky, even in his later years. It just doesn't pose any stylistic problems, it's as easy to speak as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were <b>reading</b> <b>the</b> newspaper, I just {{know what to do with}} it.' ...|$|R
