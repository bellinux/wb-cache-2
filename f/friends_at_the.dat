5|$|Balzac wrote Louis Lambert {{during the}} summer of 1832 while he was staying with <b>friends</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Château de Saché, and {{published}} three editions with three different titles. The novel contains a minimal plot, focusing mostly on the metaphysical ideas of its boy-genius protagonist and his only friend (eventually revealed to be Balzac himself). Although it is not a significant example of the realist style for which Balzac became famous, the novel provides insight into the author's own childhood. Specific details and events from the author's life – including punishment from teachers and social ostracism – suggest a fictionalized autobiography.|$|E

5|$|At the Tenkaichi Budōkai {{three years}} later Goku and his allies oppose Kame-Sen'nin's rival and Taopaipai's brother, Tsuru-Sen'nin, and his {{students}} Tenshinhan and Chaozu.

The samurai Yajirobe takes Goku to the hermit Karin, where he receives healing and a power boost. Meanwhile, Piccolo fights Kame-Sen'nin and Chaozu, leading to both their deaths, and uses the Dragon Balls to regain his youth before destroying Shenlong.

5|$|Benchley {{continued}} to freelance, submitting humor columns {{to a variety}} of publications, including Life (where fellow humorist James Thurber stated that Benchley's columns were the only reason the magazine was read). He continued meeting with his <b>friends</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Algonquin, and the group became popularly known as the Algonquin Round Table. In April 1920, Benchley landed a position with Life writing theatre reviews, which he would continue doing regularly through 1929, eventually taking complete control of the drama section. His reviews were known for their flair, and he often used them as a soapbox for issues of concern to him, whether petty (people who cough during plays) or more important (such as racial intolerance).|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1910, Mao {{requested}} that his father permit him to attend the Dongshan Higher Primary School, which was located fifteen miles from Shaoshan; unlike the Shaoshan Primary School, this establishment taught modern subjects such as natural sciences. Yichang agreed to fund his son's tuition and dormitory space, and so the sixteen-year-old Mao set off to Dongshan with his older cousin, Wen Yunchang, who was also enrolled there. His two best <b>friends</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> school were Yunchang and Xiao Zizhang (also known as Xiao San), who would later join Mao in the communist movement and {{would become one of}} his first biographers. However, he was bullied for being rural and unsophisticated by many of his classmates, who were typically the sons of wealthy landlords from Xiangxiang district. He nevertheless proved to be a successful student, gaining the respect of his teachers through hard work, an ability to compose essays in the classical style, and voracious reading. Here, he first learned about geography, and increased his knowledge of ancient Chinese history.|$|E

In the coming years, Cooper contemplated his mortality and his personal behavior, and started discussing Catholicism with his family.

Shortly before midnight, he died in his sleep, at age 42, of an enlarged heart.

They contacted Thomas Noguchi, the Chief Coroner for the County of Los Angeles, who arranged for removal of the body; Divine's friends were able to prevent the press from taking any photographs of the body as it was being carried out of the hotel.|$|E

At the start of Left Behind, she returns after a long absence, and ambushes Ellie in her room.

Ellie eventually supports her decision, but as the two dance together before parting, Ellie becomes tearful, and begs Riley not to leave. Without hesitation, Riley rips her dog tags off, deciding to choose Ellie instead of the Fireflies. Moved, Ellie impulsively kisses her, which she returns.

5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather than let {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to write one, which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a Nuclear Accident in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two research assistants had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil nuclear power programme. The UKAEA Council decided to press on with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not interested in it. With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic <b>friends</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Defence found some money to cover her expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Mulan is {{initially}} misguided by Mushu who encourages {{her to go}} to war and in how to behave like a man. However, under command of Li Shang, she and her new <b>friends</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> camp, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po, become skilled warriors. Mushu, desiring to see Mulan succeed, creates a fake order from Li Shang's father, General Li, ordering Li Shang to follow them into the mountains. They arrive at a burnt-out village and discover that General Li and his forces have been wiped out by the Huns. As they solemnly leave the mountains, they are ambushed by the Huns when Mushu accidentally fired a cannon causing their position to be given away, but a second firing of a cannon by Mulan buries most of the enemy forces in an avalanche. Mulan is slashed by Shan Yu in his rage at her wiping out his army during the battle, and she is forced to reveal her deception when she receives medical attention. Instead of executing Mulan as the law states, Li Shang spares her life for saving his life from the avalanche by leaving her on the mountain {{as the rest of the}} army departs for the Imperial City to report the news of the Huns' demise. However, the avalanche failed to eliminate all the enemies, as Mulan catches sight of a small number of surviving Huns, including Shan Yu, making their way to the City, intent on capturing the Emperor.|$|E
