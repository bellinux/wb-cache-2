60|$|There were {{plans to}} perfect; innumerable things to remember; {{a car and}} accessories, horses, saddles, outfits to buy. Carley <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> sit down at her table and write and figure, {{but she could not}} do it then.|$|E
6000|$|Fanny knit {{her brows}} {{a little at}} this, and felt {{somewhat}} less humble than she did before. She <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> get indignant if her uncle abused her lover, and that, if she did, her courage would rise in proportion. Her aunt continued-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You are vexing {{about the}} Union,' said Mrs. King, without {{answering}} this last speech, or <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> begin to cry herself.|$|R
60|$|Phoebe glided {{in without}} waiting for the sense of awkwardness, though she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have to cross the whole room, and she durst not ask any one to bring the {{dangerous}} bouquet to her--not even Robert--he must not be stung in her service.|$|E
60|$|We all enjoyed our {{turnovers}} except Sara Ray. She ate hers but she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> {{not have}} done so. Her mother did not approve of snacks between meals, or of jam turnovers at any time. Once, when Sara was in a brown study, I {{asked her what she}} was thinking of.|$|E
60|$|It is {{not easy}} to say which Gillian most looked forward to: Mysie's presence, or the absence of the {{supervision}} which she imagined herself to suffer from, because she had set herself to shirk it. She <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> feel more free. But behold! a sudden change, produced by one morning's letters.|$|E
50|$|Thwonk was {{published}} in 1996 by Bantam books. The novel features A.J. McCreary and her love interest Peter Terris. She encounters a real-life cupid who can only help her in one aspect of her life: either romantically, academically, or artistically. <b>She</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> use the wish {{to get into a}} prestigious art school but she has been obsessed with Peter for months which complicates her situation.|$|R
6000|$|... "What, my lord," [...] said Elizabeth, looking kindly upon him, [...] "is {{there no}} one little corner over {{which you would}} wish to spread a veil? Ah! I see you are {{confused}} at the question, and your Queen <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not look too deeply into her servants' motives for their faithful duty, lest she see what might, or at least ought to, displease her." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{opened her}} eyes as though driven {{to do so by}} surprise. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not have {{expressed}} herself in that way, but she could not avoid the temptation.|$|R
6000|$|Kate {{liked his}} looks, {{and the way}} in which he held out his hand to her; but she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be scolded for her awkward greeting: so she put out her hand as if she had no use of her arm above the elbow, hung down her head, and said [...] "--do;" [...] at least no more was audible.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thirteenth!" [...] muttered Tom in his throat, {{and well}} he might, {{for two or}} three voices cried out that was too bad, and that it was all his own fault, for not {{accepting}} Ethel's help. He took little heed, but crept to his corner without another word, and Mary <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be thumped if she should torment him there.|$|E
60|$|Sir Jasper, {{who thought}} she behaved {{exceedingly}} well about it, authorised an earnest invitation {{to make her}} home at Clipston; but though she was much gratified, she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be in his way, and, perhaps, in that of the boys, {{and it was too}} far from the work to which she meant to devote herself even more completely, when it would be no longer needful to be companionable to a semi-invalid fond of society.|$|E
60|$|Ally looked coquettishly at me, as if <b>she</b> did not <b>know</b> whether <b>she</b> <b>should</b> favor me to that extent, and {{the young}} princess was further solicited.|$|R
6000|$|... "What word?" [...] <b>she</b> said. <b>She</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> {{not have}} asked the question, {{but it was so}} {{necessary}} for her to put off the evil if it were only for a moment.|$|R

60|$|It {{was highly}} {{entertaining}} {{to see a}} young blooming beauty come and slily pick up the boy from his company, carry him home with as much eagerness as she would her gallant, because she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> get {{the name of her}} gallant out of him before he went, and bribe him with a sugarplum to write down the name of a young Scotch peer in a green ribbon that her mouth watered after.|$|E
60|$|We were choking with laughter, {{and trying}} to persuade her that threats were unworthy; but she said that {{kindness}} had no effect, and that she must now use threats, and that she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> succeed, for an astrologer {{had told her that}} everything she did between this Wednesday and Friday should prosper--she had the prediction in her pocket. By this time we had coasted along the moat till we came to the Loire, where a whole swarm of boatmen, honest fellows in red caps and striped shirts, came up, shouting, 'Vive Monsieur!' 'Vive Mademoiselle!' and declaring that it was a shame to lock her out of her fathers own town.|$|E
60|$|Hiram Powlett had no {{appetite}} whatever, but he meekly sat down, ate a few mouthfuls of food, and then, when Hesba {{left the}} room for a moment, took his cap from the peg and went out. Mrs. Powlett ate her meal standing; she had no more appetite for it than her husband, but she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not have an opportunity of coming downstairs again when once the doctor had left, so she conscientiously forced herself to eat as much as usual, and then, after clearing away the things, and warning the little servant that she must not make the slightest sound, {{she went into the}} parlour and sat down until the doctor came downstairs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I shall lose you,' said Cora; 'but indeed I {{have long}} seen {{it was the}} only thing. If I had only <b>known,</b> <b>she</b> never <b>should</b> have come here.' ...|$|R

50|$|In the casino, Sister Mary’s out-of-tune guitar upsets Levora’s dog. Levora is {{extremely}} insulted because Sister doesn’t {{know any of}} her hit songs including “Makin’ Sweet Sweet Love” and “Put It Where I Want It.” Levora leaves in a huff, unknowingly dropping a quarter. Sister Mary <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> {{give it to the}} orphans, but imagines gambling it and winning them a pile of money. Nonetheless, she tries {{to walk away from the}} slot machine but is unable to ("Never Can Say Goodbye").|$|R
60|$|The {{day after}} Mr. Kendal's departure, Mrs. Meadows had another attack, but a {{fortnight}} still passed before the long long task {{was over and}} the weary spirit set free. There had been no real consciousness {{and no one could}} speak of regret; of anything but relief and thankfulness that release had come at last, when Albinia had redeemed her pledge and <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> no more hear of the dreary 'very bad night,' nor be greeted by the low, restless moan. The long good-night was come, and, on the whole, there was peace and absence of self-condemnation in looking back on the past connexion. Forbearance and unselfishness were recompensed by the calm tenderness with which she could regard one who at the outset had appeared likely to cause nothing but frets and misunderstandings.|$|E
60|$|No {{wonder that}} all this time Christina cowered at the {{discordant}} sounds below, trembled, and prayed while she waited on her poor young charge, who tossed and moaned in fever and suffering. She was still far from recovered when the materials of the debauch failed, and the household began to return to its usual state. She was soon restlessly pining for her brother; and when her father came up to see her, received him with scant welcome, and entreaties for Ebbo. She <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be better if she might only sit on his knee, and lay {{her head on his}} shoulder. The old Freiherr offered to accommodate her; but she rejected him petulantly, and still called for Ebbo, till he went down, promising that her brother should come.|$|E
60|$|Harry was {{the only}} one to whom there was the {{freshness}} of novelty, and he was the great element of animation; but as the time came near, honest Harry had been seized with a mortal dread of the tears he imagined an indispensable adjunct of the ceremony, and went about privately consulting every one how much weeping was inevitable. Flora told him she saw no reason for any tears, and Ethel that when people felt very much they couldn't cry; but on the other hand, Blanche said she felt extremely nervous, and <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be overcome; Gertrude assured him that on all former occasions Mary did all the crying herself; and Aubrey told him that each bridesmaid carried six handkerchiefs, half for herself and half for the bride.|$|E
60|$|Mary Armstrong's colour {{heightened}} a little. It was {{the first}} time he had called her by her Christian name since that ride through the Kaffirs. <b>She</b> thought <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> what he wanted to speak to her about, and <b>she</b> well <b>knew</b> what <b>she</b> <b>should</b> say.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Can't Stay Away" [...] is a mid-tempo electronica-inspired rock song. The lyrical content {{deals with}} the {{addiction}} to a person, physiologically, sexually and emotionally and commissioning the addiction. The song's lyric [...] "I'm conflicted / I inhale now but addicted" [...] references the metaphorical use of drugs, asserting the person of addiction as a drug. The song is about a girl who can’t stay away from this guy even though <b>she</b> <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>should,</b> and details how the girl cannot {{get enough of the}} guy because of emotional distress and previous attachment.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, I ask you, as {{a feeling}} heart,' said the Captain, {{dropping}} his voice, 'why <b>should</b> <b>she</b> <b>know?</b> why <b>should</b> <b>she</b> {{be made to}} know, {{until such time as}} there wam't any help for it? She took to old Sol Gills, did that sweet creetur, with a kindness, with a affability, with a--what's the good of saying so? you know her.' ...|$|R
60|$|But, alas! Emily was {{not pleased}} with her performance; {{she said that she}} {{intended}} something quite different, and by manner, rather than by words, indicated that she should not be satisfied unless Lily completely altered it. It was to be worn at the castle the next evening, and Lily <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> have no time for it {{in the course of the}} day. Accordingly, at half-past twelve, as Claude was going up to bed, he saw a light under his sister's door, and knocked to ask the cause. Lily was still at work upon the trimming, and very angry he was, particularly when she begged him to take care not to disturb Emily. At last, by threatening to awake her, for the express purpose of giving her a scolding, he made Lily promise to go to bed immediately, a promise which she, poor weary creature, was very glad to make.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh, ma fille!" [...] whispers the lady. [...] "Thou wouldst {{ask me what}} I said? I said 'Yes!'--behold all I said." [...] And so 'tis my {{wife has}} peached, and not I; {{and this was the}} sum of our conversation, as the carriage, all too swiftly as I thought, galloped towards Hampstead, and flew back again. Theo had not agreed to fly in the face of her honoured parents--no such thing. But we would marry no other person; no, not if we lived to be as old as Methuselah; no, not the Prince of Wales himself would she take. Her heart she had given away with her papa's consent--nay, order--it was not hers to resume. So kind a father must relent one of these days; and, if George would keep his promise--were it now, or were it in twenty years, or were it in another world, she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> never break hers.|$|E
60|$|Lord Cashel, in {{this last}} speech, had greatly {{overshot}} his mark; his object had been to make the separation between his ward and her lover permanent; and, hitherto, he had successfully appealed to her pride and her judgment. Fanny had felt Lord Cashel to be right, {{when he told her}} that she was neglected, and that Frank was dissipated, and in debt. She <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be unhappy as the wife of a poor nobleman, and she felt that it would break her proud heart to be jilted herself. She had, therefore, though unwillingly, still entirely agreed with her, guardian as to the expediency of breaking off, the match; and, had Lord Cashel been judicious, he might have confirmed her in this resolution; but his last thunderbolt, which had been intended to crush Lord Ballindine, had completely recoiled upon himself. Fanny now instantly understood the allusion, and, raising her face, which was again resting on her hands, looked at him with an indignant glance through her tears.|$|E
60|$|Babie did {{not like}} it, but <b>she</b> well <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be contemptuously put down if she {{attempted}} an inquiry, far less a remonstrance, with Janet. Only, with a puzzled sort of watch-dog sense, she {{sat up in bed}} and stared.|$|R
60|$|Miss Baker had {{now gone}} back to Littlebath, either to receive Adela Gauntlet, or because <b>she</b> <b>knew</b> that <b>she</b> <b>should</b> be more {{comfortable}} in her own rooms than in her uncle's dismal house--or perhaps because Sir Lionel was there. She had, however, gone back, and Caroline remained mistress for {{the time of her}} grandfather's household.|$|R
50|$|Later, Dill calls Mary and Jeff {{finds out}} {{they intend to}} see each other. Mary <b>knows</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> not go, but the two go up to Aunt Paula's (Billie Burke) country house in Phoenicia, New York. The two share a romantic day, and they profess their love for each other. Dill calls his butler {{to tell him to}} pick them up {{tomorrow}} morning, but Connie overhears and sets off for Phoenicia. Aunt Paula also realizes the two are at her house, and goes there with Jeff in order to prevent the scandal from getting worse. In fact, the night previously, Dill accidentally burned himself, and the two did not sleep together.|$|R
