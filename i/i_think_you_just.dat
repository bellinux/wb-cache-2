5000|$|As {{with most}} Johnson songs, [...] "Stop Breakin' Down Blues" [...] failed to {{generate}} much interest with the blues record buying public {{when it was}} released. However, his work was kept alive by a [...] "small circle of Mississippi peers" [...] with interpretations recorded by other blues artists. In 1945, Sonny Boy Williamson I recorded his version as an early Chicago blues with Big Maceo (piano), Tampa Red (guitar), and Charles Sanders (drums) (RCA Victor 20-3047). Titled [...] "Stop Breaking Down", the song featured somewhat different lyrics, including the refrain [...] "I don't believe you really really love me, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> like the way my music sounds" [...] in place of Johnson's [...] "The stuff I got it gon' bust your brains out, hoo hoo, it'll make you lose your mind". Williamson's song inspired the versions sung [...] "by most postwar Chicago blues artists".|$|E

The news brought mixed {{feedback from}} fans; Wilson is purported to have expressed through his Facebook page: [...] "It kind of bums {{me out to}} see some of the negativity here about the album I've been working so hard on. In my life in music, I’ve been told too many times not to fuck with the formula, but as an artist it’s my job to do that - and I think I’ve earned that right ... So let’s just wait until the album comes out because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> might dig it as much as I do." [...] Thomas has asserted: [...] "Brian isn’t trying to write to a younger or older audience, he’s telling the story from his perspective." [...] Later, a guest appearance by Nate Ruess of Fun was also confirmed, and that Ocean's collaboration would be excluded, replaced by a remake of the Beach Boys' 1965 instrumental [...] "Summer Means New Love".|$|E

30|$|The {{simple answer}} {{is that we are}} humans and we need to tell stories. We need to tell stories that glorify the human estate. We need heroes. We need to imagine that human actions made a difference. Leaders are part of the classic story by which we come to imagine that. We tell stories about leaders and leaders tell stories about {{themselves}} that allow us to imagine that we control an uncontrollable world. That’s very good. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> if <b>you</b> could <b>just</b> imagine – suppose you had a choice, a world that’s uncontrollable – would you rather imagine that you could control it, or give up? For me, the human being who imagines he or she can control it is a more attractive human being.|$|R

As you get a bit older you explore {{different}} themes. The new album {{is a bit of a}} wide range, there’s some happier party kinda tunes, then there’s some serious ones about like people who have died and that kind of thing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that if <b>you</b> <b>just</b> write about what’s going on in your life, there’s always gonna be someone out there that can relate, because we all go through some of the same things." ...|$|R
5000|$|... Secretary of State of The Vatican, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, {{stated that}} the result in Ireland was [...] "a defeat for humanity" [...] and he [...] "was deeply saddened by the result". [...] "The church must take account of this reality, but {{in the sense that}} it must {{strengthen}} its commitment to evangelisation. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> cannot <b>just</b> talk of a defeat for Christian principles, but of a defeat for humanity". The remarks represent the most damning assessment of the referendum result by a senior church official to date. Earlier the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, had quoted Theologian emeritus of the Pontifical Household Cardinal Georges Cottier as saying that the referendum result was impossible to understand [...] "without taking into account the paedophilia scandal which has rocked the Irish Church." ...|$|R
40|$|Suppose you and I {{disagree}} about p. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> p, <b>you</b> <b>think</b> ¬p. And suppose {{that we are}} epistemic peers about whether p.

Second, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>you</b> are <b>just</b> as smart as I am and just as likely as I am {{to get it right}} about p-like questions, and <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the same about me. 1 Interesting question: What should we believe {{in light of the fact}} that we disagree with each other? People {{disagree about}} how to disagree. I'll be interested in conciliationist views of disagreement.

5000|$|The Art of Negative Thinking {{received}} multiple {{international film}} awards. It won the [...] "Best Film" [...] category at the Lübeck Nordic Film Days.

6000|$|Dinah made no answer, {{and they}} walked on in silence for some yards, till {{they came to the}} stone stile, where, as Adam had passed through first and turned round to give her his hand while she mounted the unusually high step, she could not prevent him from seeing her face. It struck him with surprise, for the grey eyes, usually so mild and grave, had the bright uneasy glance which accompanies {{suppressed}} agitation, and the slight flush in her cheeks, with which she had come downstairs, was heightened to a deep rose-colour. She looked as if she were only sister to Dinah. Adam was silent with surprise and conjecture for some moments, and then he said, [...] "I hope I've not hurt or displeased you by what I've said, Dinah. Perhaps I was making too free. I've no wish different from what you see to be best, and I'm satisfied for you to live thirty mile off, if <b>you</b> <b>think</b> it right. <b>I</b> shall <b>think</b> of <b>you</b> <b>just</b> as much as I do now, for you're bound up with what I can no more help remembering than I can help my heart beating." ...|$|R
500|$|Forgoing {{the closure}} favored by its contemporaries, Changelings final {{sequence}} reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive. The shot is a {{two and a}} half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd. The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character, brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The [...] "hustle and bustle" [...] of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks, pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks. The version of the film that screened at Cannes did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, [...] "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> need to <b>just</b> swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you." [...] Owens told Eastwood the film should end like Chinatown(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: [...] "The camera booms up and she walks away from us from a very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time." ...|$|R

I never thought it would come to this. When Father and I came north I took a fancy to come here and stay with Mrs. Pennington--who is an old nurse of mine--until Father decided where to take up our abode. I got here the night before we met. My trunk was delayed so I put on an old cotton dress her niece had left here--and you came and saw me. I made Mrs. Pennington keep the secret--she thought it great fun; and I really was a great hand to do little chores and keep the cats in {{subjection}} too. I made mistakes in grammar and dropped my g's on purpose--it was such fun to see you wince when I did it.
