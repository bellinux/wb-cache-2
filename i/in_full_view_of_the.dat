5|$|Early on 10 June {{another group}} of thirty-one men arrived at the 9th Parachute Battalion position. These and other stragglers, who had arrived through the night, brought the {{battalion}} strength to around 270 men. At 11:00 the Germans attacked 'A' Company again, {{but this time the}} attack was ill-coordinated and was easily repelled. Shortly afterwards the battalion killed around fifty Germans, who had started digging defences <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British position. Then 'A' Company ambushed a German patrol, causing several casualties. That afternoon a strong force of Germans occupied the Château and used it as a base to start an infantry and self propelled gun assault on the British battalion. With no mortar ammunition left, the British had to use their PIATs and machine-guns to stop the attack.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1935, Đujić {{presided over}} a {{gathering}} of twenty newly recruited Chetniks in a village just north of Knin, together with General Ljubo Novaković and one of Pećanac's commanders. The gathering was held <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> villagers, and {{marked the first time}} that Đujić publicly donned a Chetnik uniform. This consisted of World War I-era Serbian Army battledress and a black lambswool cap known as a šubara, with skull and crossbones insignia. On 6 September 1935, Đujić formed a Chetnik organisation in Vrlika. Several months later, he assembled a band of 70 Chetniks in the villages of Otrić and Velika Popina.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} three {{soldiers}} entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains {{and out of the}} second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window, forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation {{at the front of the}} embassy took place <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video. As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.|$|E

5|$|The 4th Light Horse Brigade (less the 4th Light Horse Regiment and two squadrons or five {{troops of}} 12th Light Horse Regiment) arrived at Beisan at 13:45 on 24 September. Here they {{received}} Order No. 31 from the Australian Mounted Division to attack Samakh. After leaving Beisan for Jisr el Mejamie, at 16:35 {{they received a}} message dropped from an aircraft, which reported that Samakh was defended by 50 rifles and machine guns. They arrived at Jisr el Mejamie at 21:00 and made contact with the regiment of the 4th Cavalry Division, holding the bridge. A further order to capture Samakh was received at 22:10, which included the additional objective of reconnoitring towards Tiberias, where they were {{to cooperate with the}} 3rd Light Horse Brigade in capturing the town. The orders gave the brigade commander, Brigadier General William Grant, the choice of attacking immediately, or waiting for the 4th Light Horse Regiment and the squadrons of the 12th Light Horse Regiment. He decided not to delay attacking the apparently weak rearguard, as he expected to be reinforced by the 15th Light Horse Regiment, 5th Light Horse Brigade, on the way to Samakh. If Grant had waited for reinforcements, the attack would have been during in daylight, <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defenders in the railway station building, which may have resulted in at least as many casualties, and perhaps many more, during a potentially more protracted fight.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had been}} costly for both sides. Australian casualties included nine killed and 28 wounded, while one howitzer and two mortars had been damaged. North Vietnamese casualties included 52 dead, who lay strewn around the perimeter, while 23 small arms and seven crew-served weapons {{had also been}} captured by the Australians. While Radio Hanoi quickly announced a major North Vietnamese victory there was {{little doubt that the}} Australians had convincingly repulsed the attack, even if they had come close to suffering a military and political catastrophe, with the task force headquarters itself nearly being destroyed. The initial delays during the fly-in had left the defenders spread haphazardly and, had the North Vietnamese assaulted without the preparatory fire that ultimately alerted the Australians, the result may have been different. Equally, the fortunes of war had resulted in the Australian guns being laid {{in the direction of the}} main North Vietnamese assault, and the firepower they afforded had probably been decisive. The occupation of FSB Coral was one of the first such operations conducted by 1 ATF and many of the deficiencies evident had been due to this inexperience. Command and control had been insufficient and in hindsight the lack of co-ordination in setting up the defence could have been avoided with the appointment of a local defence commander. The absence of proper aerial reconnaissance prior to insertion had also resulted in units and their supporting elements landing on unsuitable ground <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese, while the delay in the insertion of the second battalion denied them enough time to establish their positions before night fell. Failures in the assessment and timely distribution of intelligence were also identified.|$|E

25|$|The {{ground between}} the Carthaginian and Roman camps was flat, {{treeless}} and barren, {{with a low}} ridge sitting midway between the camps. There were hollows and dead patches {{of land in the}} ground behind and beside the hill where soldiers could hide without being noticed. Hannibal selected a picked body of 5,000 infantry and 500 cavalry, and ordered them to conceal themselves in groups of 200-300 in the hollows and dead ground on the night before the battle. The skill and discipline of the Carthaginians is evident through their flawless execution of this potentially hazardous operation. At dawn, a contingent of Carthaginian light infantry took position on the hill <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Romans.

25|$|For {{the scene}} where Aaron tricks Titus into cutting off one of his hands, the primary source was {{probably}} an unnamed popular tale about a Moor's vengeance, published in various languages throughout the sixteenth century (an English version entered into the Stationers' Register in 1569 has not survived). In the story, a married noble man with two children chastises his Moorish servant, who vows revenge. The servant goes to the moated tower where the man's wife and children live, and rapes the wife. Her screams bring her husband, but the Moor pulls up the drawbridge before the nobleman can gain entry.

25|$|The fifth {{match of}} the night, the third to feature CMLL and Invasores on {{opposite}} sides, was {{centered around the}} personal issues between CMLL representative La Sombra and Invasor Olímpico, focusing {{on the fact that}} La Sombra had won Olímpico's match at the previous month's CMLL 77th Anniversary Show and Olímpico was eager to gain his revenge. La Sombra teamed up with Máscara Dorada and La Máscara to take on Olímpico, Alebrije and Psicosis. The first fall ended after just over six minutes of wrestling as Psicosis pinned La Máscara and Alebrije pinned Máscara Dorada. In the second fall Máscara Dorada pinned Olímpico, followed by La Sombra pinning El Alebrije to even the match between the two teams. In the closing moments of the match Olímpico tried to kick La Sombra in the groin, but Sombra caught the foot to prevent it. Instead Olímpico pulled off La Sombra's mask <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> referee to draw the disqualification, then he kicked La Sombra in the groin. Los Invasores ignored the referee and proceeded to beat up La Máscara and Máscara Dorada as well, stealing the masks of all three tecnicos and then challenging the team to a future Luchas de Apuestas match, a challenge that was ignored as the three tecnicos tried to cover up as best they could.|$|E
25|$|On 12 July 1806, two {{breaches}} {{began to}} be seen in Gaeta's walls, one at the Breach Battery on the left and one under the Queen's Battery on the right. Surrender was demanded, but Hotz refused. The barrage continued and on the 15th a French engineer officer crept far enough forward to note that the west breach could be attacked. By 16 July, Masséna had heard about the French defeat at Maida and was anxious to capture Gaeta. There remained only 184,000 pounds of gunpowder and less than 5,000 shot, a three-day supply. By this time, the French had 12,000 troops on hand in the infantry divisions of Partouneaux and Gardanne, with the cavalry divisions of Espagne and Mermet in support. Despite the ammunition shortage, the bombardment dragged on, widening the breaches. Normally, the commander of the besiegers kept the time of the final assault on a fortress a secret from the defenders. But Masséna intended to overawe Hotz with his deliberate preparations for attack. On the morning of 18 July <b>in</b> <b>full</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> defenders, the French massed a force of grenadiers and chasseurs under General of Brigade François-Xavier Donzelot to attack the left breach, while voltigeurs led by Valentin assembled to assault the right breach.
