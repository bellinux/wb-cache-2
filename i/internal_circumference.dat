40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{definition}} of a relatively novel machining technology to finish the internal part of narrow and long tubular parts made from high resistance stainless steel. A hybrid technology, namely, fluidized bed assisted abrasive jet machining (FB-AJM), was developed and a thorough experimental investigation was concurrently performed. First, a systematic approach, based upon design of experiments, was used to examine the influence of leading operative variables on process. Surface roughness and material removal trends consistent with theoretical expectations were found. Subsequently, the machining mechanisms were analyzed in terms of the evolution of roughness and waviness profile. FB-AJM was found to be a not pressure-copying machining technology. Lastly, the uniformity and the precision of machining all around the <b>internal</b> <b>circumferences</b> of the workpieces were checked out to assure the applicability of FB-AJM to process an ever-growing variety of complex shaped components. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of currents and potentials {{in a circular}} conducting medium surrounding two eccentric dipoles was studied to establish how much information on the number, location, and orientation of the dipoles could be deduced from measurements of potential in the medium at various distances from the generators. When a single, eccentric dipole was active, the curve illustrating the {{distribution of}} potentials along the boundary exhibited different kinds of asymmetry, which revealed that the dipole was eccentric and gave some information about its orientation. When both dipoles were active, two maxima and two minima, revealing the presence of two generators, appeared along the boundary when the angle between dipole moments was 150 ° or more. Along <b>internal</b> <b>circumferences</b> two maxima and two minima appeared at smaller angles between dipole moments {{and the location of}} the maxima was closely related to that of the dipole anodes.

We focus on the normalization procedure which is aimed to standardize experimental settings and, in part, to simulate physiological conditions. During normalization, it is determined the <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> of a vessel stretched to a tension that corresponds to the transmural pressure of 100 mm Hg (IC 100).

We found out that the maximal active wall tension of the FA was achieved at the NF value of 1. 1, and that of the MA at 0. 9.

40|$|Purpose: Cerebral {{vasospasm}} is {{the leading}} cause of morbidity and mortality following subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although a number of factors have been examined in clinical and experimental studies, the agent(s) responsible for developing and diminishing vasospasm remain poorly understood. Here, the role of edaravone, an antioxidant agent, was evaluated for its ability to diminish vasospasm in an animal model of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Materials and Methods: A rat basilar artery subarachnoid hemorrhage model was used. Rats were divided into three groups: sham (n= 7; Group 1), subarachnoid hemorrhage (n= 7 Group 2), and subarachnoid hemorrhage plus edaravone (4 mg/kg intraperitoneally, n= 7; Group 3). At the end of the seventh day, the rats were sacrificed, their brains were removed, and sections were taken from the basilar artery. These were examined using a light microscope, comparing the <b>internal</b> luminal <b>circumference</b> of the basilar artery of each group. Results: The circumference was largest in Group 1, followed by Group 3 and then Group 2. That of Group 3 was 2 % higher than that of Group 2, but this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusion: This animal model for vasospasm suggests that edaravone helps enlarge <b>internal</b> luminal <b>circumference</b> following vasospasm caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage. It may do this by blocking lipid peroxidation and thereby reducing the effects of oxyhemoglobin and reactive oxygen species...|$|R
40|$|High salt diet cardiac {{fibrosis}} by activating cardiac aldosterone. We {{hypothesized that}} enhanced cardiac aldosterone production by high salt intake may increase left ventricle (LV) weight and cardiomyocyte size and induce fibrosis in both ventricles. Regular salt (0. 6 %) or high salt (8 %) diet, either without or with spironolactone (20 or 80 mg/kg/day) {{were given to}} Wistar rats for 4 and 8 weeks. Both LV weight and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional diameter were increased significantly by high salt diet after 4 and 8 weeks. Both LV and right ventricle (RV) collagen and fibrosis as well as mean arterial pressure (MAP) remained unchanged after 4 weeks, but increased significantly after 8 weeks on high salt diet. Spironolactone (80 mg/kg) prevented the high salt-induced increases in LV weight and cardiomyocyte cross-sectional diameter as well as LV and RV collagen and fibrosis, and attenuated the increase in MAP. Spironolactone (20 mg/kg) was somewhat less effective. The high salt induced changes in cardiac and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and cardiac fibrosis were prevented by spironolactone, {{which is consistent with}} the concept that cardiac aldosterone mediates these cardiac effects of high salt diet. Role of brain renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) in cardiac remodeling post-MI. To assess the contribution of the brain RAAS in the activation of the cardiac RAAS and remodeling post-MI, Wistar rats with intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of spironolactone and transgenic (TG) rats deficient in brain angiotensinogen were studied. An MI was induced by acute coronary artery ligation. Spironolactone was administered by icv infusion (100 ng/h) or orally (80 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks post-MI in Wistar rats. TG rats and control Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were followed for 8 weeks. MI decreased LV peak systolic pressure (LVPSP) and LV dP/dt max and increased LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) and plasma catecholamines and serum aldosterone, which were prevented or attenuated by both icv and oral spironolactone at 6 weeks post-MI. MI increased <b>internal</b> <b>circumferences,</b> cardiomyocyte diameter, fibrosis, laminin and fibronectin, and aldosterone in the LV or and RV, which were also significantly prevented/inhibited by both icv and oral spironolactone at 6 weeks post-MI in Wistar rats as well as at 8 weeks post-MI in TG rats. Magnitude of beneficial effects of icv spironolactone at low doses was largely equal to that achieved with its oral administration at much higher doses, indicating that in addition to other sites of actions, aldosterone appears to activate central nervous system (CNS) pathways and thereby influences peripheral mechanisms involved in cardiac remodeling. The findings in TG rats support the pivotal role of locally produced angiotensin II in the brain in cardiac remodeling post-MI. The brain RAAS appears to activate a cascade of events, among others an increase in cardiac aldosterone, which {{play a major role in}} cardiac remodeling post-MI...|$|R

It is unknown whether these changes also occur in other preplacental vessels (radial and arcuate arteries) in normal pregnancies. Since the radial and arcuate arteries need to dilate in order to accommodate the increase in placental blood flow during pregnancy, it is expected that they are also invaded by trophoblast and respond with {{structural changes}}. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the extent of trophoblast invasion in the guinea-pig preplacental vasculature and its effect on the vascular structure of mesometrial, myometrial and arcade arteries. Under general anaesthesia the vascular system of non- (n = 4), mid- (n = 4) and late- (n = 8) pregnant guinea-pigs was fixed by immersion or perfusion. Cross-sections of immersion-fixed mesometrial and arcade arteries were stained with toluidine blue. Cross-sections of perfusion-fixed mesometrial, myometrial and arcade arteries were stained with haematoxylin-eosin, Elastica van Gieson staining and antibodies against alpha-smooth-muscle-actin (ASMA), cytokeratin and factor VIII, to detect vascular smooth muscle, trophoblastic, and endothelial cells, respectively. In addition, the external and <b>internal</b> vascular <b>circumference</b> of sections from perfusion-fixed tissue was determined. All cross-sections were evaluated by light microscopy. In the course of pregnancy, progressive endothelial swelling, disappearance of the elastic lamina interna and disarrangement of the tunica media were observed in the myometrial and throughout the mesometrial arteries up to the junction with the arcade arteries. These changes coincided the migration of keratin-positive staining giant cells.

40|$|SUMMARY The small arteries play an {{important}} functional role in establishing the increased peripheral resistance found in essential hypertension. This paper concerns the direct measurement of the intrinsic mechanical and contractile properites of two categories of small arterial resistance vessels in the mesenteric bed of 5 -month-old normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The vessels had mean internal diameters of 246 fim and 153 /*m when relaxed at 100 mm Hg effective transmural pressure. Segments (1 mm) were mounted {{in such a way}} that <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> could be controlled and the circumferential wall tension (T) measured. After mounting, each vessel was maximally activated (by K * depolarization at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mM Ca 2 +) at an <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> for which AT was approximately maximal, where AT = Tactlve- Trelaxed. From the average values of AT measured we have estimated (on the basis of Laplace's equation) that the SHR vessel would average values of AT measured we have estimated (on the basis of Laplace's equation) that the SHR vessels would have been able to contract against 34 % greater pressures than the WKY vessels (P < 0. 001). Optical measurements of the dimensions of these vessels showed a 23 % greater wall thickness in the SHR vessels (P < 0. 02). There were no significant differences in the calculated active wall stresses of the SHR and WKY vessels; this suggests that the greater contractility found in the SHR vessels may be due to their having a greater smooth muscle cell content. These vessel measurements have been examined as well as the rats ' blood pressures and heart to body weight ratios. Th...|$|E

Segments of small arteries (lumen diameter 150 ̂ m) were taken from a specific location in the mesenteric bed of 6 -, 12 -, and 24 -week-old SHR and WKY rats, and mounted on a myograph capable of directly measuring their tension. Vessels were set to <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> L, = 0. 8 Lin,, where Ll 00 was an estimate of the <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> the vessels would have had when relaxed in situ and under a transmural pressure of 100 mm Hg. At all ages, compared with WKY vessels, the effective lumen diameter, I, = L,/x, was smaller in the SHR vessels. However, media hypertrophy was seen only in vessels from 12 - and 24 -week-old SHRs. In physiological salt solution the noradrenaline sensitivity of all vessels was similar (EDM * 2. 4 nM). However, inhibition of neuronal uptake with cocaine revealed that at all ages the noradrenaline sensitivity of the vascular smooth muscle cells in the SHR vessels was greater than that of the cells in the WKY vessels. The results also suggested that the neuronal noradrenaline uptake was greater in the SHR vessels at all ages. The main increase in BP in the SHRs occurred between the ages of 6 week and 12 weeks. The results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that differences in the structure of th...|$|E

However, transplantation-related complications including cardiovascular disease deteriorate the clinical outcome {{and quality of}} life. We have investigated the acute effects of conditioning regimen on the pharmacology, physiology and structure of large elastic arteries and small resistance-sized arteries in a SCT mouse model. Mesenteric resistance arteries and aorta were dissected from Balb/c mice conditioned with busulphan (Bu) and cyclophosphamide (Cy). In vitro isometric force development and pharmacology, in combination with RT-PCR, Western blotting and electron microscopy were used to study vascular properties. Compared with controls, mesenteric resistance arteries from the Bu-Cy group had larger <b>internal</b> <b>circumference,</b> showed enhanced endothelium mediated relaxation and increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Bu-Cy treated animals had lower mean blood pressure and signs of endothelial injury. Aortas of treated animals had a higher reactivity to noradrenaline. We conclude that short-term consequences of Bu-Cy treatment divergently affect large and small arteries of the cardiovascular system. The increased noradrenaline reactivity of large elastic arteries {{was not associated with}} increased blood pressure at rest. Instead, Bu-Cy treatment lowered blood pressure via augmented microvascular endothelial dependent relaxation, increased expression of vascular eNOS and remodeling toward a large...|$|E
40|$|A new {{finite element}} {{procedure}} for {{the solution of}} the electromagnetic flow meter weight function is presented. The weight function represents the relative contribution of the fluid velocity at a particular spatial location in the flow cross section to the output signal from the flow meter. The solution of the weight function is important for inferring the velocity profile from measured potential differences within the electromagnetic flow meter. First, a numerical simulation model was constructed with COMSOL Mutiphysics [1]. Next, a study was undertaken to compare the numerical simulation model with Shercliff's [2] analytical solution for the weight function. The finite element methodology was found to be correct for solving the weight function. Based on this result, the numerical simulation model was used to compute the weight function for two flow meter geometries. For both cases the electrodes were located on the <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> of the flow pipe and the line joining the electrodes was normal to the imposed magnetic field. In the first case the separation of the electrodes was equal to one pipe diameter but in the second case the electrode separation was less than one pipe diameter.

40|$|Rats {{with chronic}} heart failure (CHF) develop {{increased}} myogenic constriction in mesenteric resistance arteries. Here we investigated increased myogenic constriction {{in relation to}} alterations in EDHF- and NO-mediated dilatation in CHF-rats. Male Spraque-Dawley rats were subjected to myocardial-infarction or sham-surgery. At 9 - 10 weeks after surgery, isolated mesenteric artery ring preparations were studied in a wire-myograph. Stretch-induced myogenic constriction was obtained by stepwise increase of the <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> diameter (0. 5 - 1. 2 L 100). Cyclooxygenase- and eNOS-inhibitors were employed to study NO- and EDHF-mediated dilatation in response to acetylcholine. Rats with CHF (n = 8), but not sham-rats (n = 6), developed significant myogenic constriction. In addition, the contribution of endothelial dilator mediators was significantly altered in CHF-rats, with increased dependency on NO and decreased EDHF-mediated dilatation. Moreover, EDHF-mediated dilatation was inversely correlated with myogenic constriction in individual CHF-rats (r = - 0. 74, p = 0. 04). These data demonstrate increased myogenic constriction in mesenteric arteries of rats with CHF post-MI to be correlated to decreased EDHF-mediated dilatation. These lindings extend the previous observation that myogenic constriction antagonizes EDHF-mediated dilatation in rat coronary artery under normal conditions, and suggests this relationship also to become functional in mesenteric arteries under pathopbysiological conditions of CHF.

40|$|Small {{arterial}} resistance vessels (internal diameter about 175 micrometer) {{have been}} {{mounted on a}} myograph that enabled their wall tension, T, and <b>internal</b> <b>circumference,</b> L, to be measured and controlled with a time resolution of about 4 ms. Maximally activated vessels were subjected to isometric releases (step changes in L) and isotonic releases (step changes in T) of varying extents and at two different temperatures (27 degree C and 37 degree C). The recovery from an isometric release was monotonic and {{did not include the}} two phases seen in skeletal muscles. The isotonic release response did, however, contain a velocity transient lasting about 150 ms: the velocity immediately after the release was about six times the steady shortening velocity. The form of both the isometric and isotonic release responses and their dependence on the extent of release can be explained in terms of a modified Hill model in which the "series elastic component" (SEC) is replaced by the series combination of an undamped-SED (that is, an undamped elastic element) and a damped-SEC (a Voigt element). Although the initial response to both types of release was independent of temperature, all stages of subsequent responses were temperature dependent, with Q 10 's in the range 1. 5 - 2. 0. The results suggest that the responses to isotonic and isometric releases may in part be due to active processes...|$|E

The difficulties include; difficulties in extrusion, bulkiness of rammers, and non-uniformity {{in the distribution of}} blows, and associated sample disturbance when preparing specimens for triaxial testing. These problems have been curbed by the use of minicompactors which are newer technologies. A minicompactor (Nanjing Soil Minicompactor) manufactured to enable production of 39. 1 mm diameter that can fit into triaxial machine (Model TS 2 - 1) was used for the compaction studies. The minicompactor is made of a split mold of 96. 06 cm 3 by volume. The rammer weight 600 g fits well to the <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> of the mould.

These features are very desirable to contemporary researchers, but it will be very important to ensure uniformity with the standard compactors on which the experimental methodologies were originally based.

40|$|During {{physical}} examination {{of patients with}} suspected obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a comment is frequently made that {{they appear to have}} a short and fat neck. To confirm this subjective impression by objective measurements, we studied a group of 123 patients referred to us because of snoring and suspected OSA, all of whom had nocturnal polysomnography and measurements of external and internal neck circumference. The external neck circumference was measured {{at the level of the}} superior border of the cricothyroid cartilage. Internal neck circumferences were calculated from the measurements of pharyngeal, glottic, and tracheal areas obtained by the acoustic reflection technique. Internal pharyngeal circumference was further subdivided into the proximal, middle, and distal thirds. The acoustic technique also permitted us to measure the distance between the teeth and the glottic minimum, which reflects the length of the upper airway. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) correlated only with the external neck circumference, the body mass index, and the <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> of the distal pharynx; these three variables accounted for 39 % of the variability in AHI. We conclude that the external and internal neck circumferences and the degree of obesity are important predictors of sleep apnea; it is possible that obesity produces its effect via fat in the neck. We speculate that the static pharyngeal size modulated by the dynamic loading of the airway due to the weight of fatty tissue of the neck may contribute to the pathogenesis of OSA...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{introduce}} a new technique to measure the velocity distribution of the dispersed component of a vertical, upward, water continuous two-phase pipe flow. Here, it is proposed that measurements {{of the variation in}} the local conductance of the mixture can be cross correlated to determine the local velocity distribution of, for example, gas bubbles in water. The measurements were conducted by using arrays of axially separated conductance sensors placed normal to the flow. Each array contained eight electrodes distributed over the <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> of the pipe carrying the flow. The arrays, were mounted at a known distance from each other along the pipe. Within each array, individual electrodes could be configured as either ‘excitation’, ‘measurement’ or ‘earth’. By changing the electrode configuration of an array the electric field sensitivity distribution associated with the array could be altered, thus changing the region of the flow ‘interrogated’ by the system. By cross correlating the output signals from these arrays, in various combinations, the velocity of the dispersed phase can be obtained at different regions within the flow, thereby enabling the velocity profile of the dispersed phase to be measured. The sensitivity distribution associated with given electrode configurations has been investigated in a bench test. First the flow meter was filled with water, and then nonconducting rods were inserted into the flow meter at various spatial locations parallel to the pipe, the resulting change in conductance was measured [...] The sensitivity distribution has also been simulated using COMSOL software.

Conditions were established under which maximal activation was obtained at all lengths. Below L 0 (the length at which maximum tension, delta T 0, was developed) the active tension fell with decreasing length along a line which extrapolated to 0. 38 L 0; below 1. 1 L 0 the relation was reversible regardless of the protocol used. Above L 0 the active tension fell linearly with increasing length along a line which extrapolated to zero tension at 1. 82 L 0. At the longer lengths investigated (up to 1. 6 L 0) the passive tension upon which the active responses were superimposed was as high as 4. 4 delta T 0. However, measurements of the dynamic characteristics of the preparation (with a time resolution of 2 ms) suggest that the active tension measured is nevertheless {{a measure of the}} active properties of the contractile apparatus. Direct light microscopic observation of the effect of length change on the cells within the walls of the preparation showed that changes in vessel length produced, on average, the same percentage change in cell length. Histological examination showed no signs of cell destruction following large extensions. The results suggest that the decrease in tension with extension above L 0 is due to changes in the properties of the contractile apparatus, rather than to cellular damage...|$|E

We investigated the effect of 3 commonly used solutions—Ringer's solution, normal saline solution, and heparinized whole blood—on in vitro endothelial and contractile functions of the human radial artery. Methods: Radial artery segments were harvested, cut into 3 -mm rings, and stored in unoxygenated Ringer's solution, normal saline solution, or heparinized whole blood for 45 minutes. Rings stored in Krebs solution were used as controls. The rings were then mounted and stretched to an optimal resting tension in oxygenated Krebs solution at 37 °C. Contraction responses to potassium, norepinephrine, and serotonin and relaxation responses to acetylcholine, verapamil, and nitroprusside were evaluated. Results: Fifty-six radial artery ring segments from 14 patients (n = 7 rings for each contaction-relaxation curve) were studied. Equilibrated resting tension was 9. 6 ± 0. 3 mN (5. 9 ± 0. 2 g), and resting <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> was 6. 4 ± 0. 2 mm. Absolute maximum contraction to potassium was significantly less in rings stored in normal saline solution than in rings stored in control solution (10. 7 ± 0. 6 g vs 14. 5 ± 0. 6 g, P <. 01; 95 % confidence intervals, 0. 9 - 6. 9). There {{was no difference in}} the contraction to norepinephrine (P =. 11) and serotonin (P =. 25) among the 3 solutions compared with the control solution. Rings stored in heparinized whole blood had significantly greater endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (P <. 007), whereas those stored in normal saline solution had reduced responses. Endothelium-independent relaxation to verapamil and nitroprusside were similar among the 3 solutions.

For a potential distribution obtained in a uniform magnetic field, this direction is not unique for quadratic and higher-order components; thus, multiple possible solutions exist for the reconstructed velocity profile. A procedure for choosing the optimum velocity profile is proposed. It is applicable for single-phase or two-phase flows, and requires measurement of the potential distribution in a non-uniform magnetic field. The potential distribution in this non-uniform magnetic field is also calculated for the possible solutions using weight values. Then, the velocity profile with the calculated potential distribution which is closest to the measured one provides the optimum solution. The reliability of the method is first demonstrated by reconstructing an artificial velocity profile defined by polynomial functions. Next, velocity profiles in different two-phase flows, based on results from the literature, are used to define the input velocity fields. In all cases, COMSOL Multiphysics is used to model the physical specifications of the EMFM and to simulate the measurements; thus, COMSOL simulations produce the potential distributions on the <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> of the flow pipe. These potential distributions serve as inputs for the {{analytical method}}. The reconstructed velocity profiles show satisfactory agreement with the input velocity profiles. The method described in this paper is most suitable for stratified flows and is not applicable to axisymmetric flows in its present form. Its novelty is that it provides not only a mean flow velocity, but a velocity distribution in a circular pipe section as an analytical function of the spatial coordinates...|$|E
40|$|Multiphase flow is the {{simultaneous}} flow {{of two or}} more phases, in direct contact, in a given system. It is important in many fields of chemical and process engineering and in the oil industry, e. g. in production wells and in sub-sea pipelines. The behavior of the flow will depend on the properties of the constituents, the flows and the geometry of the system. Upward inclined solids-liquid flows are sometimes encountered in the process industries for example in water treatment processes and in oil well drilling operations. Measurements of the local solids volume fraction distribution and the local axial solid velocity distribution are important, for example, in measuring the solids volumetric flow rate. This paper presents a non-intrusive Impedance Cross-Correlation (ICC) device to measure the local solids volume fraction distribution and the local axial solids velocity distribution in upward inclined solids-water flows in which these distributions are highly non-uniform. The ICC device comprises a non-conductive pipe section of 80 mm internal diameter fitted with two arrays of electrodes at planes, A and B, separated by an axial distance of 50 mm. At each plane, eight electrodes are equispaced over the <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> of the pipe. A control system consisting of a microcontroller and analogue switches is used such that, for planes A and B, any of the eight electrodes can be configured as an ‘excitation electrode’ (V+), a ‘virtual earth measurement electrode’ (ve) or an ‘earth electrode’ (E) so that different regions of the flow cross section can be interrogated. Conductance signals from planes A and B are then cross correlated to yield the solids velocity in the region of flow under interrogation. Experiments were carried out in water-solids flows in a flow loop with an 80 mm inner diameter, 1. 68 m long Perspex test section which was inclined at o 30 to the vertical. The most significant experimental result is that, at the upper side of the inclined pipe, the measured solids velocity is positive (i. e. in the upward direction), whilst at the lower side of the inclined pipe the measured local axial solids velocity is negative (i. e. in the downward direction). This shows quantitative agreement with previous work carried out using intrusive local probes to measure the solids velocity profile. The study also shows qualitative agreement with high speed film of the flow. It is believed that this method of velocity profile measurement is much simpler to implement than dual-plane electrical resistance tomography (ERT) ...|$|E
40|$|Multiphase flow is the {{simultaneous}} flow {{of two or}} more phases, in direct contact, and is important in the oil industry, e. g. in production wells, in sub-sea pipelines and during the drilling of wells. The behaviour of the flow will depend on the properties of the constituent phases, the flow velocities and volume fractions of the phases and the geometry of the system. In solids-in-liquid flows, measurement of the local solids volume fraction distribution and the local axial solids velocity distribution in the flow cross section is important for many reasons including health and safety and economic reasons, particularly in oil well drilling operations. However upward inclined solidsliquid flows which are frequently encountered during oil well drilling operations are not well understood. Inclined solids-liquid flows result in non- uniform profiles of the solids volume fraction and axial solids velocity in the flow cross- section. In order to measure the solids volumetric flow rate in these situations it is necessary to measure the distributions of the local solids volume fraction and the local axial solids velocity and then to integrate the product of these local properties in the flow cross section. This thesis describes the development of a non-intrusive Impedance Cross-Correlation (ICC) device to measure the local solids volume fraction distribution and the local solids axial solids velocity distribution in upward inclined solids-water flows in which these distributions are highly non-uniform. The ICC device comprises a non-conductive pipe section of 80 mm internal diameter fitted with two arrays of electrodes, denoted „array A‟ and „array B‟, separated by an axial distance of 50 mm. At each array, eight electrodes are equispaced over the <b>internal</b> <b>circumference</b> of the pipe. A control system consisting of a microcontroller and analogue switches is used such that, for arrays A and B, any of the eight electrodes can be configured as an "excitation electrode" (V+), a "virtual earth measurement electrode" (Ve) or an "earth electrode" (E) thus enabling the local mixture conductance in different regions of the flow cross-section to be measured and thereby allowing the local solids volume fraction in each region to be deduced. The conductance signals from arrays A and B are also cross-correlated to yield the local solids axial velocity in the regions of flow under interrogation. A number of experiments were carried out in solids-in-water flows in a flow loop with an 80 mm inner diameter, 1. 68 m long Perspex test section which was inclined at three different inclination angle to the vertical (o 0, o 15 and o 30). The obtained results show good quantitative agreement with previous work carried out using intrusive local probes. Integration of the flow profiles in the cross section also yielded excellent quantitative agreement with reference measurements of the mean solids volume fraction, the mean solids velocity and the solids volumetric flow rate. Furthermore, this study also showed good qualitative agreement with high speed film of the flow. It is believed that the method of velocity and volume fraction profile measurement described in this thesis is much simpler to implement, more accurate and less expensive than the currently very popular technique of dual-plane Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT). Finally, the thesis describes a mathematical model for predicting the axial velocity distribution of inclined solids-water flows using the solids volume fraction profiles measured by the ICC device. Good agreement was obtained between the predicted velocity profiles and the velocity profiles measured using the ICC device. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
