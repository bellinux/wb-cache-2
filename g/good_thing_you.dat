In an {{interview}} in 2005, Bill Clinton expressed support for the attack: [...] "everybody talks about what the Israelis did at Osiraq, in 1981, which, I think, in retrospect, was a really <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> <b>You</b> know, it kept Saddam from developing nuclear power." [...] Louis René Beres wrote in 1995 that [...] "ad {{it not been for}} the brilliant raid at Osiraq, Saddam's forces might have been equipped with atomic warheads in 1991." ...|$|E

Murrow, and FDR told Donovan, apropos of the COI, [...] "It's a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> got me started on this."

"You {{have found}} me sitting here sure enough," [...] said Phoebe; [...] "but {{if you wish}} to keep me company, you must walk to the Lodge with me; and you shall carry my pitcher for me, if you will be so kind. I will hear all the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>you</b> have to say to me as we go along. But Sir Henry calls for his glass of water {{regularly}} before prayers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you for {{the affection}} you offer me, but I cannot accept it, for I have nothing to give you in return but the friendliest regard, the most sincere good-will.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said MacFarland, {{with another}} grin, [...] "it's a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> are along, J. P.; {{you can show}} 'em around town until they begin to feel at home." ...|$|E

Please to accept a brace of bucks and a turtle, which come herewith. My worthy colleague, who was so liberal {{last year of his}} soup to the poor, will not, I trust, refuse to taste a little of Alderman Birch's--'tis offered on my part with hearty goodwill. Hey for the 6th, and vive la joie! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes,' replied Costan, {{understanding}} directly {{what was}} wanted. 'Come, Petru, let us drink {{now we have}} the chance, and then we will set out on our way home. It is a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> have us with you, to protect you from harm.' ...|$|E

It wouldn't put you out?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "There is one <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> about <b>you.</b> Whenever <b>things</b> happen {{somewhere in}} the world, you'll run over there faster than the Western reporters. But the {{questions}} you ask...too simple! Sometimes naive!" ...|$|R

6000|$|People--the pleasure-loving {{people of}} to-day--have {{no use for}} latent tragedy. Excitement, yes! and drama; but only from the secure {{distance}} of a private seat at an Old Bailey trial. The murder of Philip de Mountford could be discussed with {{quite an amount of}} enjoyment between a dinner party and a ball supper, but not in Louisa Harris's presence! By Gad! too much of a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> know! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A thief!" [...] he said. [...] "Upon my word, {{and a very}} <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> {{must make}} of it; for I see you dressed like a gentleman from top to toe.

You achieved distinction, you know, when you were with us. You are qualified for many <b>good</b> <b>things.</b> <b>You</b> have laid a foundation that any edifice may be raised upon; and is it not a pity that you should devote the spring-time of your life to such a poor pursuit as I can offer?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> if <b>you</b> could stay overnight," [...] said Dr. Reed. [...] "Then you could have two days {{instructions}} instead of one. You could stay at my sister's house." ...|$|R
6000|$|Dear Old Godfrey,--Don't be vexed with {{me because}} I was so cross [...] this evening. Something in that old church upset me, and you know [...] I have a dreadful temper. I didn't mean {{anything}} I said. I daresay [...] it is a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> should go away and see the world instead of [...] sticking in this horrid place. Leave your address with Mother [...] Parsons, and I will write to you; but mind you answer my letters [...] or I shan't write any more. Good-bye, old boy. Your affectionate Isobel. Who is always thinking of you.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was the {{steering}} outfit did it," [...] explained Tom. [...] "I'm awfully sorry I scared you. I was scared myself. I {{was going to}} fly over you {{and then go back}} when all at once I found I couldn't budge the rudders. Then I got alarmed, thinking the machine might turn turtle on me, so I shut off the engine, intending to glide to earth. But I didn't want to glide right into the auto. Sam, it's a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> thought to run backwards. If you hadn't {{there would have been a}} smash-up sure!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Talcott, you did {{get hold}} of all the {{regulation}} stock material. The Home Market idea is a great field for you. You think a city is of itself a <b>good</b> <b>thing?</b> <b>You</b> think a city means civilization. Well, I want to tell you, and maybe you won't believe me, cities mean vice, and crime, and poverty, and vast wealth for the few, {{and as for the}} Home Market idea, how would it do to let the farmer buy in the same market in which he sells? He sells in the world's market, but you'd force him to buy in a protected market." ...|$|E
