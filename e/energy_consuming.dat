5|$|The Soviet {{rapid transit}} system {{was seen as}} the quickest, cleanest and {{cheapest}} way of urban transport, and eventually another point acquired greater significance; the authorities could allocate their resources from the automobile industry to the rapid transit sector and save a substantial volume of the country's diesel and petrol. Because rapid transit system usually were cheaper to operate and less <b>energy</b> <b>consuming,</b> the Soviet authorities managed to construct 20 rapid transits nationwide, with a further nine in construction when the Soviet Union collapsed. Twenty other stations were under construction in 1985. The country's rapid transit system was the most intensively used in the world.|$|E
25|$|The fixed link has {{generated}} increased road traffic volume, which has meant increased air pollution. However, {{there has been}} significant savings in the energy consumption by switching from ferries to the fixed link. Train and car ferries consume much energy for propulsion, high-speed ferries consume large amounts of energy at high speeds, and air transport is highly <b>energy</b> <b>consuming.</b> Domestic air travel over the Great Belt was greatly reduced after {{the opening of the}} bridge, with the former air travellers now using trains and private cars.|$|E
25|$|Integration of sensing and {{actuation}} systems, {{connected to}} the Internet, is likely to optimize energy consumption as a whole. It is expected that IoT devices will be integrated into all forms of <b>energy</b> <b>consuming</b> devices (switches, power outlets, bulbs, televisions, etc.) {{and be able to}} communicate with the utility supply company in order to effectively balance power generation and energy usage. Such devices would also offer the opportunity for users to remotely control their devices, or centrally manage them via a cloud-based interface, and enable advanced functions like scheduling (e.g., remotely powering on or off heating systems, controlling ovens, changing lighting conditions etc.).|$|E
50|$|Consumers are organisms of an {{ecological}} food chain that receive <b>energy</b> by <b>consuming</b> other organisms. These organisms are formally {{referred to as}} heterotrophs, which include animals, some bacteria and fungi. Such organisms may consume by various means, including herbivory, predation, parasitization, and biodegradation.|$|R
40|$|Buildings are the EU's largest <b>energy</b> users, <b>consuming</b> over 40 % of Europe's total primary energy. One way {{of cutting}} this {{consumption}} is by avoiding or reducing cooling energy through proper solar shading. This paper presents examples of innovative solar control devices and emphasizes their relevance {{for the energy}} performance of buildings...|$|R
50|$|Fungivory or mycophagy is {{the process}} of organisms {{consuming}} fungi. Many different organisms have been recorded to gain their <b>energy</b> from <b>consuming</b> fungi, including birds, mammals, insects, plants, amoeba, gastropods, nematodes, bacteria and other fungi. Some of these, which only eat fungi, are called fungivores whereas others eat fungi as only part of their diet, being omnivores.|$|R
500|$|Physically, American kestrels are leaner {{and less}} muscular than larger falcons. The {{pectoral}} flight {{muscles of the}} American kestrel make up only about 12% of its body weight, as compared to about 20% for the strongest flying falcons such as the peregrine. The wings are moderately long, fairly narrow, and taper to a point. Their less muscular body type is adapted to energy conserving ambush hunting, rather than spending large amounts of <b>energy</b> <b>consuming</b> time on the wing and getting into long tail-chases of bird prey. For their size, they have strong talons and beaks, and can swiftly dispatch prey. Their lean build and energy conserving strategy allows a lower daily food intake than if they were more strongly muscled, yet with enough strength to commonly take bird prey as large as themselves, and occasionally larger. [...] The success of this body style and hunting strategy {{is reflected in the}} high success of the species in densely populating a large range throughout the Americas. [...] The flight of the American kestrel is not so dramatic and swift as more muscular falcons such as Merlins and peregrines, but their efficient adaptation to a broader diet of more available smaller prey, and need for less food per day, has resulted in there being many more of them.|$|E
2500|$|Canadian {{energy policy}} {{reflects}} the constitutional {{division of powers}} between {{the federal government and}} the provincial governments. The Constitution of Canada places natural resources under the jurisdiction of the provinces. [...] However, the three prairie provinces originally did not control the natural resources in the provinces as a condition of their entry into Confederation, until the Natural Resources Acts of 1930. The provincial governments own most of the petroleum, natural gas and coal reserves, and control most of the electricity production. This means that the national government must coordinate its energy policies with those of the provincial governments, and intergovernmental conflicts sometimes arise. The problem is particularly acute since, while the <b>energy</b> <b>consuming</b> provinces have the bulk of the population and are able to elect federal governments which introduce policies favouring energy consumers, the energy producing provinces have the ability to defeat such policies by exercising their constitutional authority over natural resources.|$|E
2500|$|Phosphoric acid {{fuel cells}} (PAFC) were first {{designed}} and introduced in 1961 by G. V. Elmore and H. A. Tanner. In these cells phosphoric acid {{is used as}} a non-conductive electrolyte to pass positive hydrogen ions from the anode to the cathode. These cells commonly work in temperatures of 150 to 200 degrees Celsius. This high temperature will cause heat and energy loss if the heat is not removed and used properly. This heat can be used to produce steam for air conditioning systems or any other thermal <b>energy</b> <b>consuming</b> system. [...] Using this heat in cogeneration can enhance the efficiency of phosphoric acid fuel cells from 40–50% to about 80%. Phosphoric acid, the electrolyte used in PAFCs, is a non-conductive liquid acid which forces electrons to travel from anode to cathode through an external electrical circuit. Since the hydrogen ion production rate on the anode is small, platinum is used as catalyst to increase this ionization rate. A key disadvantage of these cells is the use of an acidic electrolyte. This increases the corrosion or oxidation of components exposed to phosphoric acid.|$|E

50|$|Time {{switches}} can be {{used for}} many purposes, including saving electric <b>energy</b> by <b>consuming</b> it only when required, switching equipment on, off, or both at times required by some process, and home security (for example switching lights in a pattern that gives the impression that premises are attended) to reduce the likelihood of burglary or prowling.|$|R
30|$|Clock {{synchronization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important components in WSN. It is essential for transmission scheduling, power management, data fusion, and many other applications. For example, in power management, the duty cycling helps the sensors to maintain <b>energy</b> by <b>consuming</b> minimal power during the sleep mode. The performance of duty cycling is closely related to the accuracy of the whole network synchronization.|$|R

50|$|Ice {{storage tanks}} store ice frozen by cheaper energy {{at night to}} meet peak daytime demand for cooling. The energy isn't stored directly, but the work-product of <b>consuming</b> <b>energy</b> (pumping away heat) is stored, having the {{equivalent}} effect on daytime consumption.|$|R
5000|$|The Ghent - Merelbeke route was {{intended}} to be the first of a proposed multi-route network. Instead its Gyrobuses stayed in service for only three years, being withdrawn late autumn 1959. The operator considered them unreliable, [...] "spending more time off the road than on", and that their weight damaged road surfaces. They were also considered to be <b>energy</b> hungry, <b>consuming</b> 2.9 kWh/km - compared with between 2.0 kWh/km and 2.4 kWh/km for trams with much greater capacity.|$|R

Efforts in sustainable energy consumption can be classified {{at a high level}} by the three following categories: ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{reduction}} of energy consumption {{has become a}} key issue for industries, because of economical, enviromental and marketing reasons. Data – centers and networking infrastructure involve high – performance and high – availability machines. They therefore rely on powerful devices, which require <b>energy</b> – <b>consuming</b> air conditioning to sustain their operation, and which are organized in a redundant architecture. In recent years, valuable efforts have indeed been dedicated to reducing unnecessary energy expenditure, which is usually nicknamed as a greening of the networking technologies and protocols...|$|R

50|$|Also {{problematic}} is {{that some}} measurements on single molecules are carried out in cryogenic temperatures (near absolute zero), which is very <b>energy</b> <b>consuming.</b> This is done to reduce signal noise enough to measure the faint currents of single molecules.|$|E
50|$|The {{transitions}} to lower <b>energy</b> <b>consuming</b> states occur when inactivity timers trigger. The T1 timer controls transition from DCH to FACH, the T2 timer controls transition from FACH to PCH, and the T3 timer controls transition from PCH to idle.|$|E
2500|$|Insulation is the [...] "cheapest" [...] way to {{maintain}} a fairly constant body temperature, without <b>consuming</b> <b>energy</b> to produce more body heat. Therefore, the possession of hair or fur would be good evidence of homeothermy, but would not be such strong evidence of a high metabolic rate.|$|R

Since then, MFCs have attracted special attention from researchers, representing a promising solution for energy generation. MFCs treat water {{in addition to}} generating <b>energy</b> by <b>consuming</b> organic pollutants from the wastewater. Over the last 10 years, this idea has seen a tremendous interest from scientific community leading to a promising power source to provide power for electronic devices [5] and other practical application in a cost-effective manner [6].|$|R
