Thus the rishis (sages) killed him, leaving the kingdom without an heir and in famine due to the anarchy of Vena. So, the sages churned Vena's body, out of which first appeared a dark dwarf hunter, a symbol of Vena's evil. Since the sins of Vena <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> as the dwarf, the body was now pure. On further churning, Prithu emerged from right arm of the corpse.
