Moore of Ology {{gave the}} episode a {{slightly}} more positive review, writing, [...] ""The Story Of Brenda Q", judging by only the title, {{could have been a}} Lifetime movie in the Seth MacFarlane fashion or anything else than a typical episode of the show, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> a typical episode of the show." [...] He continued, [...] "it's pretty much an episode where someone on the Family Guy writing staff needed a new way to get out a bunch of pent-up misogyny and anger." [...] He gave the episode a grade of seven out of ten.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the band's hiatus in a 2011 interview, Kinney {{told that}} Staley wasn't {{the only one}} battling addiction. [...] "He was the focal point, like singers are. So they’d single him out. But the truth was, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> everybody. I {{definitely}} had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – {{you know when you}} stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the lead vocals, Swivel decided {{to rework the}} 1980s sound on the snares as they were originally very tight. He therefore added a gated reverb for the snap sound which was long and drawn‑out snap sound. He also subbed in an additional kick underneath to add some real oomph to the bottom. Owing to the work Swivel had accomplished during production, the final mix took only a few hours. He said: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} tracks, but I just enjoyed it, to be honest. I knew how I wanted it to sound, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the last song we cut; a lot of the mixing was nailed in the production as well, which helped. Dream did a great job producing this track." [...] The bar one guitar track of [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] was entirely programmed. Similarly, the live drum section in the hook was actually done with programmed drums. Once the mixing was over, Swivel's impression were as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Sully Erna, he {{was looking}} for a {{producer}} who is known for producing great albums. When Sully talked about some producers he is interested in working with, Shannon suggested Dave Fortman, [...] "Got the mighty Dave Fortman producing who had made it before in a band called Ugly Kid Joe. I played with him for five years, toured the world with him. Love the guy, he's one of the funniest dudes ever. After Sully met Dave <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> over because Dave is such a real pleasant guy to be around and real funny, makes you feel comfortable in all ways," [...] Shannon said.|$|E
2500|$|Steve Englehart, {{who wrote}} issues #5–16, said Graham [...] "helped me plot, {{so that by}} the end <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> a co-production." [...] Graham is {{formally}} credited as co-writer of issues #14-15, though as Englehart's writing collaborator for those issues, Tony Isabella recalled, [...] "Billy Graham is credited as the co-scripter of my first issue [...] and, try as I might, I simply do not recall getting anything other than the usual penciled pages to script. I skimmed a little of that issue and, making no judgment as to whether this is a good or bad thing, the writing does strike me as all mine." ...|$|E
2500|$|McCartney {{was living}} in Jane Asher's parents' house when he found the {{inspiration}} for the song: [...] "I was laying in bed in the Ashers' garret... I was thinking of it as a song for Ringo, which it eventually turned out to be, so I wrote it as not too rangey in the vocal, then started making a story, sort of an ancient mariner, telling the young kids where he'd lived. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> my song as I recall... I think John helped out. The lyrics got more and more obscure as it goes on, but the chorus, melody and verses are mine." [...] The song began as being about different coloured submarines, but evolved to include only a yellow one.|$|E

2500|$|Twilight's director, Catherine Hardwicke, said of {{the casting}} process that [...] "verybody has such an {{idealized}} vision of Edward. They were rabid [...] Like, old ladies saying, 'You better get it right." [...] She revealed that she was initially underwhelmed by a photo of Pattinson, but said of his audition, which was a love scene with co-star Kristen Stewart: [...] "It was electric. The room shorted out, the sky opened up, and I was like, 'This {{is going to be}} good.'" [...] Pattinson has admitted; [...] "I {{had no idea how to}} play the part when I went in, and it was a good thing to find during the audition. I really wanted it after that, but I didn’t really even know what it was. I hadn’t really read any of the books. And just from that, ‘I want this job.’ <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> because of Kristen." [...] In early 2008, Pattinson spoke of a fan backlash against his casting, disclosing Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I stopped reading [...] after I saw the signatures saying 'Please, anyone else.'" [...] He revealed to the Evening Standard that; [...] "The books have a huge following, and I’ve already got bags of letters from angry fans, telling me that I can’t possibly play Edward, because I’m Diggory. I hope I can prove them wrong." ...|$|E

60|$|He treated {{his little}} brother {{in a way which}} in these times boys would call bullying; and, as no one ever dared to oppose the King's eldest son, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the same with every one else, except now and then some dumb creature, and then all Lothaire's cruelty was shown. When his horse kicked, and ended by {{throwing}} him, he stood by, and caused it to be beaten till the poor creature's back streamed with blood; when his dog bit his hand in trying to seize the meat with which he was teazing it, he insisted on having it killed, and it was worse still when a falcon pecked one of his fingers. It really hurt him a good deal, and, in a furious rage, he caused two nails to be heated red hot in the fire, intending to have them thrust into the poor bird's eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> {{the same}} {{through the whole}} journey, waste lands, marshes, and forests alternated. The Castles stood on high mounds {{frowning}} on the country round, and villages were clustered round them, where the people either fled away, driving off their cattle with them at the first sight of an armed band, or else, if they remained, proved to be thin, wretched-looking creatures, with wasted limbs, aguish faces, and often iron collars round their necks. Wherever there was anything of more prosperous appearance, such as a few cornfields, vineyards {{on the slopes of}} the hills, fat cattle, and peasantry looking healthy and secure, there was sure to be seen a range of long low stone buildings, surmounted with crosses, with a short square Church tower rising in the midst, and interspersed with gnarled hoary old apple-trees, or with gardens of pot-herbs spreading before them to the meadows. If, instead of two or three men-at-arms from a Castle, or of some trembling serf pressed into the service, and beaten, threatened, and watched to prevent treachery, the King asked for a guide at a Convent, some lay brother would take his staff; or else mount an ass, and proceed in perfect confidence and security as to his return homewards, sure that his poverty and his sacred character would alike protect him from any outrage from the most lawless marauder of the neighbourhood.|$|E

50|$|The shortgrass prairie {{is located}} on the western side of the Great Plains with the Colorado Rockies to its west and the mixed grass prairie to its east. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> {{impossible}} to define exact boundaries of the prairie.

So, the prairie extends to {{the eastern part of the}} Rocky Mountains to the west, up to Canada to the North, as far as Nebraska to the East, and as far as parts of Texas to the South.

60|$|Though in {{the middle}} of the day many bales and boxes would be trundled along the stores in front of the Apostles'; and along its {{critically}} narrow sidewalk, the merchants would now and then hurry to meet their checks ere the banks should close: yet the street, being mostly devoted to mere warehousing purposes, and not used as a general thoroughfare, it was at all times a rather secluded and silent place. But from an hour or two before sundown to ten or eleven o'clock the next morning, it was remarkably silent and depopulated, except by the Apostles themselves; while every Sunday it presented an aspect of surprising and startling quiescence; showing nothing but one long vista of six or seven stories of inexorable iron shutters on both sides of the way. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> the same with the other street, which, as before said, intersected with the warehousing lane, not very far from the Apostles'. For though that street was indeed a different one from the latter, being full of cheap refectories for clerks, foreign restaurants, and other places of commercial resort; yet the only hum in it was restricted to business hours; by night it was deserted of every occupant but the lamp-posts; and on Sunday, to walk through it, was like walking through an avenue of sphinxes.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a modern}} philanthropist, {{who had become}} so deeply {{sensible}} of the calamities of thousands and millions of his fellow-creatures, and of the impracticableness of any general measures for their relief, {{that he had no}} heart to do what little good lay immediately within his power, but contented himself with being miserable for sympathy. Near him sat a gentleman in a predicament hitherto unprecedented, but of which the present epoch probably affords numerous examples. Ever since he was of capacity to read a newspaper, this person had prided himself on his consistent adherence to one political party, but, in the confusion of these latter days, had got bewildered and knew not whereabouts his party was. This wretched condition, so morally desolate and disheartening to a man who has long accustomed himself to merge his individuality in the mass of a great body, can only be conceived by such as have experienced it. His next companion was a popular orator who had lost his voice, and--as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> all that he had to lose--had fallen into a state of hopeless melancholy. The table was likewise graced by two of the gentler sex,--one, a half-starved, consumptive seamstress, the representative of thousands just as wretched; the other, a woman of unemployed energy, who found herself in the world with nothing to achieve, nothing to enjoy, and nothing even to suffer. She had, therefore, driven herself to the verge of madness by dark breedings over the wrongs of her sex, and its exclusion from a proper field of action. The roll of guests being thus complete, a side-table had been set for three or four disappointed office-seekers, with hearts as sick as death, whom the stewards had admitted partly because their calamities really entitled them to entrance here, and partly that they were in especial need of a good dinner. There was likewise a homeless dog, with his tail between his legs, licking up the crumbs and gnawing the fragments of the feast,--such a melancholy cur as one sometimes sees about the streets without a master, and willing to follow the first that will accept his service.|$|E
6000|$|The fact is {{that the}} ladies' parlor at the hotel had been after dinner no better than a den of smugglers, in which the fair contrabandists had debated the best means of evading the laws of their country. At heart every man is a smuggler, and how much more every woman! She would have no scruple in ruining the silk and woolen {{interest}} throughout the United States. She is a free-trader by intuitive perception of right, and is limited in practice by nothing but fear of the statute. What could be taken into the States without detection, was the subject before that wicked conclave; and next, what it would pay to buy in Canada. It seemed that silk umbrellas were most eligible wares; and in the display of such purchases the parlor was given the appearance of a violent thunder-storm. Gloves it was not advisable to get; they were better at home, as were many kinds of fine woolen goods. But laces, which you could carry about you, were excellent; and so was any kind of silk. Could it be carried if simply cut, and not made up? There was a difference about this: the friend of one lady had taken home half a trunkful of cut silks; the friend of another had [...] "run up the breadths" [...] of one lone little silk skirt, and then lost it by the rapacity of the customs officers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>much</b> luck, and whether the officers happened to be in good-humor or not. You must not try to take in anything out of season, however. One had heard of a Boston lady going home in July, who [...] "had the furs taken off her back," [...] in that inclement month. Best get everything seasonable, and put it on at once. [...] "And then, you know, if they ask you, you can say it's been worn." [...] To this black wisdom came the combined knowledge of those miscreants. Basil could not repress a shudder at the innate depravity of the female heart. Here were virgins nurtured in the most spotless purity of life, here were virtuous mothers of families, here were venerable matrons, patterns in society and the church,--smugglers to a woman, and eager for any guilty subterfuge! He glanced at Isabel to see what effect the evil conversation had upon her. Her eyes sparkled; her cheeks glowed; all the woman was on fire for smuggling. He sighed heavily and went out with her to do the little shopping.|$|E
