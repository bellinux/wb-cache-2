40|$|Malaria is {{a serious}} public health problem in Pemba. It is {{holoendemic}} and thus affects mostly children and pregnant women. Following intense vector control activities in recent years, {{there has been a}} notable decline in malaria cases, presumably due to reduced populations of An. gambiae s. s. However, it was noted by Wastling (2007) that some areas in Pemba were supporting large populations of An. merus, a vector which the ZMCP recorded as absent in 2005 (ZMCP, 2007). It is probable that changes to vector population previously observed following vector control activities of the 1960 ’s may be taking place. To ensure the continued effectiveness of the Pemban malaria vector control campaign, it is prudent to determine the relative proportion of An. merus (and other members of An. gambiae s. l.) in Pemba; to document where the larvae and adults are found and consider its potential impact in the transmission of Plasmodium and the implications for clinical malaria in the region. Larvae were sampled from a diverse range of water habitats (41 sites) and ecological features of each larval site were recorded in order to investigate their relationship to species distribution and relative abundance. CDC light traps were used to collect host seeking mosquitoes from households and a <b>goat</b> <b>shed</b> neighbouring suspected An. merus breeding sites. A PCR assay was used to identify the specimens collected. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) analysis was performed on a total of 216 larvae from 19 populations. 120 larvae were positively assigned to 3 species: An. merus (50 %), An. arabiensis (5 %) and An. quadrannulatus (1 %). Whilst 96 larvae (44 %) remained unidentified. Of the 5 mosquitoes collected 2 were identified as An. merus and 3 were unidentified. An. merus dominated in brackish-waters, showing great plasticity in its choice of larval habitat. However its relative abundance decreased at high altitudes. The species composition of the An. gambiae complex appears to be undergoing the same changes as observed during the spraying campaigns of the 1950 s and 60 s. The occurrence of endophilic members of the An. gambiae complex have reduced significantly whilst the exophilic members; (mostly) An. merus, An. arabiensis and An. quadriannulatus thrive.

Johne’s disease was investigated in fibre goats on several farms. The disease was caused by sheep [S] strains of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis. The infection appeared to be less severe than the same infection in sheep in that fewer goats than sheep became infected, and fewer goats than sheep developed obvious signs of the infection. However, infected <b>goats</b> <b>shed</b> the organism in their faeces and therefore were able to spread the infection to other goats and sheep. Therefore inclusion of goats in the control program for ovine Johne’s disease is justified.

Preventive vaccination of seronegative goats is more effective in reducing shedding of C. burnetii than vaccinating seropositive goats. The age at which goats born on heavily-contaminated farms first seroconvert to C. burnetii {{has not yet been}} documented. In a 16 -month birth cohort study, the age at which goats seroconverted against C. burnetii was investigated; 95 goats were bled every 2  weeks and tested for antibodies against C. burnetii. Risk factors for seroconversion were explored and <b>goats</b> <b>shedding</b> C. burnetii were identified by testing vaginal swabs taken at the goats’ first kidding using a com 1 polymerase chain reaction assay. The first surge in the number of goats with IgM to C. burnetii was observed at week 9.

40|$|International audienceQ fever is a {{zoonosis}} {{caused by}} Coxiella burnetii, a bacterium largely carried by ruminants and shed into milk, vaginal mucus, and feces. The main potential hazard to {{humans and animals}} is due to shedding of bacteria that can then persist in the environment and be aerosolized. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate shedding after an outbreak of Q fever abortion in goat herds and to assess the relationship with the occurrence of abortions and antibody responses. Aborting and nonaborting goats were monitored by PCR for C. burnetii shedding 15 and 30 days after the abortion episodes. PCR analysis of all samples showed that 70 % (n = 50) of the aborting and 53 % (n = 70) of the nonaborting goats were positive. C. burnetii was shed into vaginal mucus, feces, and milk of 44 %, 21 %, and 38 %, respectively, of goats that aborted and 27 %, 20 %, and 31 %, respectively, of goats that delivered normally. Statistical comparison of these shedding results did not reveal any difference between these two groups. PCR results obtained for the vaginal and fecal routes were concordant in 81 % of cases, whereas those for milk correlated with only 49 % of cases with either vaginal or fecal shedding status.

Faecal {{samples were collected}} from 125 male goats on four occasions. The first sampling occurred following capture and transport, immediately after arrival at a commercial goat depot (feedlot) in Western Australia, with subsequent 3 sample collections occurring at one month intervals thereafter. Goats were composite breed and aged approximately 9 – 12 months on arrival at the feedlot. Prevalence and shedding intensity (faecal oocyst concentration) for Eimeria were determined using qPCR. Species were identified from individual oocysts (isolated using micromanipulation) using molecular analysis at two loci, specifically 18 S rRNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene (COI), and confirmed by microscopy. Longitudinal prevalence (animals positive at least once) for Eimeria spp. by qPCR was 90. 4 %, with 60 % <b>goats</b> <b>shedding</b> Eimeria spp. {{on more than one}} occasion. Point prevalence (prevalence at a single sampling occasion) ranged from 2. 4 % (fourth sampling) to 70. 4 % (second sampling). Three species were identified at the 18 S rRNA locus and confirmed by microscopy: E. christenseni (longitudinal prevalence for single infection 34. 4 %), E. hirci (17. 6 %) and E. arloingi (8. 8 %) over the four sample collections. Mixed infections were identified in 56. 8 % goats (longitudinal prevalence). 18 S rRNA sequences from E. christenseni and E. hirci were 100 % homologous with ovine E. ahsata and E. crandallis respectively, and E. arloingi was 100 % similar to caprine E. arloingi. At the COI locus, E. christenseni, E. hirci and E. arloingi grouped separately, and were closely related to ovine E. ahsata, with genetic similarities of 96. 5 %, 92. 6 % and 91. 4 % respectively. This is the first report for molecular characteristics of caprine-derived Eimeria spp. using a combination of 18 S rRNA and COI.

40|$|Introduction: Quantitative Risk {{assessment}} {{could be}} applied in industries {{as a tool to}} control and manage the safety of food products. Purpose: A contamination by Listeria monocytogenes of cheeses made from raw milk was reported by the Belgian food agency. This contamination was caused by the presence of an asymptomatic “shedder” goat in the herd. With field and laboratory collected data, a quantitative risk assessment model of the production chain was developed. Methods: A modular risk model was built to simulate the food production pathway covering the milking of goats until the final product for the customers. A dynamic square root model was used to predict the growth rate in relation with the temperature, the pH and the water activity along the production chain with predictive microbiology modules. Results: The <b>shedder</b> <b>goat</b> was identified from the herd and milk samples were taken from the two different parts of the mammary gland with 2. 6 log cfu (colonies forming units) Listeria monocytogenes/ml for the right part and absence in 25 ml for the left part of the mammary gland. Numbering of Listeria monocytogenes was carried out on the final products with 3. 6 log cfu/g in the fresh not ripened cheeses. The modular risk assessment shows a significant growth of Listeria monocytogenes during chilling and storage of the milk collected the day before the cheese production (increase of 0. 6 log cfu/ml) and during adjunction of ferment and rennet to milk (increase of 0. 8 log cfu/ml). The model confirms the results obtained in the final products. Significance: The modular risk model gives valuable informations to identify and to control critical steps in the food production chain of goat cheese made from raw milk.

Vaginal disease was not detected in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV- 1 plus MF 59 TM and these animals had undetectable levels of infectious challenge virus in their vaginal washes. Goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV- 1 in the absence of adjuvant exhibited a less severe disease when compared to naı¨ve <b>goats</b> but <b>shed</b> titers of challenge virus that were similar to those of naı¨ve goats. Detection and quantitation of latent CpHV- 1 DNA in sacral ganglia in challenged goats revealed that the inactivated CpHV- 1 plus MF 59 TM vaccine was able to significantly reduce the latent viral load when compared either to the naı¨ve goats or to the goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV- 1 in the absence of adjuvant. Thus, a vaccine composed of inactivated CpHV- 1 plus MF 59 TM as adjuvant was strongly immunogenic and induced effective immunity against vaginal CpHV- 1 infection in goats...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{antisera}} {{were raised}} in <b>goats</b> against material <b>shed</b> by two different mammary epithelial cell lines into serum-free tissue culture medium. These antisera, when added to the medium of intact, growing mouse mammary tumor cells {{in the absence of}} complement, cause distinct and dramatic alterations in cell morphology and adhesiveness. One antiserum (anti-SFM I) causes mouse mammary tumor epithelial cells to round and detach from the substratum. Treatment with the other antiserum (anti-SFM II) does not affect cell-substratum interactions, but causes the cells to convert from an epithelioid to a fibroblastic morphology. Statistical analysis of transmission electron micrographs of control and antibody-treated cells indicates that treatment with anti-SFM II is associated with a substantial reduction in the extent of intercellular junctions, particularly desmosomes. To identify the components with which the two antisera interact, nonionic detergent extracts of mouse mammary tumor cells were fractionated, and the ability of various fractions to block the morphological effects of either antiserum was determined. The whole Nonidet P 40 (NP 40) extract of the epithelial cells blocked the effects of both antisera. After the extract was subjected to ion exchange and lectin affinity chromatography, two separate fractions were obtained. One fraction blocks anti-SF...|$|R
40|$|In 2005, the Belgian {{authorities}} {{reported a}} Listeria monocytogenes contamination episode in cheese made from raw goat's milk. The {{presence of an}} asymptomatic <b>shedder</b> <b>goat</b> in the herd caused this contamination. On the basis of data collected {{at the time of}} the episode, a retrospective study was performed using an exposure assessment model covering the production chain from the milking of goats up to delivery of cheese to the market. Predictive microbiology models were used to simulate the growth of L. monocytogenes during the cheese process in relation with temperature, pH, and water activity. The model showed significant growth of L. monocytogenes during chilling and storage of the milk collected the day before the cheese production (median increase of 2. 2 log CFU/ml) and during the addition of starter and rennet to milk (median increase of 1. 2 log CFU/ml). The L. monocytogenes concentration in the fresh unripened cheese was estimated to be 3. 8 log CFU/g (median). This result is consistent with the number of L. monocytogenes in the fresh cheese (3. 6 log CFU/g) reported during the cheese contamination episode. A variance-based method sensitivity analysis identified the most important factors impacting the cheese contamination, and a scenario analysis then evaluated several options for risk mitigation. Thus, by using quantitative microbial risk assessment tools, this study provides reliable information to identify and control critical steps in a local production chain of cheese made from raw goat's milk.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{was performed to}} assess the potential risk of human listeriosis following a contamination by L. monocytogenes of cheeses made from goat raw milk reported by the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain in 2005. The source of the contamination was related to a <b>shedder</b> <b>goat,</b> excreting 2. 6 log cfu (colonies forming units) L. monocytogenes / ml without any clinical symptom. On {{the basis of the}} collected data, a quantitative microbial risk assessment model was developed covering the production chain from the milking of goats until the consumed products. Predictive microbiology models were used to simulate the growth of L. monocytogenes during the process of cheeses made from goat raw milk. The modular exposure assessment model showed a significant growth of L. monocytogenes during chilling and storage of the milk collected the day before the cheese production (increase of 1. 7 log cfu/ml for the median) and during the step of starter and rennet adjunction to milk (increase of 0. 8 log cfu/ml for the median). The median estimated final result (in the fresh cheese) was equal to 3. 5 log cfu/g. The model estimates (expressed as median final result issued from the exposure assessment) were realistic compared to the number of L. monocytogenes measured in the fresh cheese (3. 6 log cfu/g) reported during the cheese contamination period. The average number of expected cases of human listeriosis was between 0 and 1 for a high-risk sub-population and 0 for a low-risk healthy sub-population. Scenario analysis was finally performed to identify the most significant factors and aid in developing priorities for risk mitigation. Thus, by using quantitative risk assessment and predictive microbiology models, this study provided valuable information to identify and to control critical steps in a local production chain of goat cheese made from raw milk.

40|$|A 41 -year-old man {{presented}} with a 3 -week history of watery diarrhoea (four to five bowel motions per day) and central abdominal pain. Two days prior, he had passed blood per rectum, for which his general practitioner had prescribed oral metronidazole without any effect. He had no nausea, vomiting, fevers or sweats. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, and he was afebrile. Blood tests showed 20 % eosinophilia (1. 6 � 10 9 /L; normal range, 0 – 0. 5 � 10 9 /L), but were otherwise unremarkable. The result of two faecal examinations showed watery stool with occasional leukocytes, but no erythrocytes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Clostridium difficile toxins A/B and immunoassay for Cryptosporidium and Giardia were negative. In accordance with local laboratory protocol, microscopy to determine faecal concentration of eggs, cysts and parasite was not performed, as there was no history of overseas travel. Colonoscopy revealed mild terminal ileitis. Biopsies of the affected area showed an eosinophilic infiltrate in the lamina propria and submucosa, but intact surface epithelium. Occasional adult worms measuring about 70 μm wide at the midbody were seen on the luminal surface (Box 1 A and B), and were initially identified as Enterobius vermicularis. He was treated with two 100 mg doses of mebendazole 1 week apart. However, he represented 3 weeks later with no improvement in his symptoms and a persistent eosinophilia (1. 4 � 109 /L). On this occasion, faecal concentration was performed using formalin-ethyl acetate, and parasite eggs were detected on iodine wet mount (Box 1 C). These were initially misidentified as hookworm eggs, but subsequent review confirmed that they were eggs of Trichostrongylus sp. The parasites seen on terminal ileal biopsy were also reviewed. Their morphology and dimensions (70 μm-wide body) {{were found to be}} consistent with adult Trichostrongylus. 1 Further questioning revealed that the patient kept <b>goats</b> in a <b>shed</b> in his backyard in suburban Sydney. The goat manure was used as fertiliser on a nearby vegetable patch which supplied food for the household. The patient was treated with a single 13. 5 mg dose of ivermectin, and his symptoms resolved. He remained symptom-free 3 months later...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{has been}} described in which a study was made on the fleece characteristics of Angora Goats kept in Canterbury. Animals that bore twin kids were heavier at tupping than animals that had single kids. The latter were heavier than animals that remained dry. The trial animals showed highly variable fleece characteristics between body positions on an animal and between animals. Responses to environmental and seasonal influences were highly variable. The trial goats had an S/P ratio of around 7, varying between 5 and 10. During spring the mohair fleece showed rudiments of a primitive type double coated fleece by growing kemps, fibres associated with the outer coat of primitive fleeces. The trial <b>goats</b> showed a <b>shedding</b> of the entire fleece by late spring. The trial goats had high fleece yields of around 90 %. The trial animals showed a marked seasonal rhythm of mohair production, with minimum production occurring in winter and maximum production occurring in late spring to early summer. Reproductive activities reduced annual mohair production by about 10 - 14 %. This reduction was brought about by a decrease in fibre diameter, a decrease in fibre length growth rate {{and an increase in}} the number of inactive follicles during winter and early spring. Fleece characteristics changed throughout the year. Average fibre diameter was lowest in winter and highest in spring. Average fibre length growth rate was lowest in winter and highest in summer. The number of growing fibres/unit area was highest in summer and lowest in winter. The degree of medullation (including kemps) was highest in spring and lowest in winter. Relationships between fleece characteristics varied considerably, however: -: average fibre diameter changes occurred prior to average length growth rate changes. -: average fibre diameter and average fibre length correlated positively. -: average fibre diameter and degree of medullation correlated positively. -: average fibre length growth rate and fibre length variation showed an inverse relationship. -: the number of growing fibres/unit area and the degree of medullation showed an inverse relationship. Kemp fibres grew predominantly along the backline and downward over the rump. Kemps grew excessively in spring and to a lesser degree in autumn. Kemps, though relatively few, had a marked influence on average fibre diameter. Angora Goats in Canterbury should be shorn early in spring and early in autumn in order to obtain mohair of high standard. Assessment of the degree of kemp and hairiness of animals should be carried out around late spring to early summer (December). Assessing the average fibre diameter of mohair is best done with a projection microscope on a midside sample, which should be collected in late summer. The C. S. I. R. O Fibre Fineness Distribution Analyser, in its present form of development, cannot be recommended for measuring mohair...|$|R
