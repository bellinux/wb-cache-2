Computer-aided Bridge Management Systems (BMSs) are used to establish the best possible bridge MR&R strategies which ensure an adequate level of safety at the lowest possible bridge life-cycle cost.

The model investigates the contribution of each driver factor on the dependent variable—the number of State-reportable crashes in which the driver was involved.

This data, combined with knowledge of design principles for waterfront structures, is used to provide a rapid estimate of the load capacity of the pier. This study focuses on a strategy for providing a rapid structural assessment of a waterfront pier given the information gathered during the on-site inspection combined with principles of waterfront structure design. The author has developed a program using the C programming language that, given the limited information gathered by UCT personnel, can be used in the field to provide an estimate of the structural capacity of an open, timber, pile- supported pier.

40|$|Port State Control {{has become}} an {{important}} aspect in the enforcement of international regulations. The practice of Port State Control was implemented in recognition {{to the fact that}} certain flag states were unable or unwilling to enforce international rules and standards on vessel in their register. Since the start of the regional cooperation under Paris Memorandum of Understanding in Europe has the regime of Paris MoU seen much development? The means of assuring that foreign vessels are in compliance with international regulations range from detaining substandard vessels to using information systems to raise awareness with the general public and also as a warning system for substandard vessels. Through the Paris MoU website can any person access information on the results of an inspection of a vessel, which has been inspected by a member state of Paris MoU. This information has an impact on a shipping company commercial position, as charterers can easily access the <b>inspection</b> <b>record</b> on any vessel. With the high stakes following an inspection is it not unlikely that conflicts can emerged between the two parties, the authority and the ship owner? This thesis explores the different perceptions on conflicts around Port State Control inspections. The available Appeal procedures for ship owners in the member states and Paris MoU have been mapped to examine the means for a ship owner to raise concerns in case a mistake has been made in an inspection. The findings show a high difference on the perceptions. The authorities which participated in the research indicated no conflicts, while the participating shipping company and shipping association gave the opposite view and an indication of unreported cases are common. Plausible causes for conflicts has been identified as interpretation of regulations and improperly trained crews and Port State Control Officers. Following these findings was the development of Paris MoU and the STCW code examined. The examinations showed that Paris MoU has developed vastly in recent time while the STCW code has not seen any major developments in the competences connected to ensuring compliance with legislative requirements. Recommendations to ship owners has been identified which includes internal education and utilization of coming Paris MoU publications. The final findings of this thesis points to that further research in the area can bring further light on the subject, for which the available previous research has been severely limited...|$|E
40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (TB) is a contagious neglected zoonosis {{of cattle}} that is prevalent but under-investigated in Cameroon, hence {{this study was}} designed to assess the epidemiology of bovine TB in cattle, risks for M. bovis infection in cattle and humans; and public health implications of zoonotic bovine TB in the highlands of Cameroon. A retrospective study of meat inspection records (1994 – 2010) was done to estimate the prevalence of TB lesions in slaughtered cattle in the North West region. The prevalence of bovine TB and anti-bovine TB antibodies in live cattle based on tuberculin skin tests (2 surveys) and immune-chromatographic assays respectively were carried out in the Western and Adamawa highlands of Cameroon. The performance of the tuberculin tests for bovine TB diagnosis in cattle using various tuberculin skin test cut-off points against the detection of anti-bovine TB antibodies (hypothesised risks of exposure) was compared. Suspected TB lesions from slaughtered cattle and infected human sputa were cultured on Lowentein – Jesen and Middlebrook 7 H 9 media to isolate mycobacteria agents for molecular genotyping using genomic deletion analysis and spoligotyping. Risk factors for exposure and transmission of zoonotic bovine TB infection of cattle and cattle professionals, and its public health significance were determined using structured questionnaires. Seventeen years of meat <b>inspection</b> <b>record</b> revealed that suspect TB lesions were identified in 599 of 129, 165 slaughtered cattle at the Bamenda abattoir. The lungs and associated lymph nodes (over 60 %) were the most affected tissues. Other results showed that the prevalence of anti-bovine TB antibodies in cattle in the study regions was 37. 17 %. Chi square statistics revealed that irrespective of the tuberculin test cut-off value (P 48), strong associations existed between the detection of anti-bovine TB antibodies and disease status. A 95 % confidence interval analysis of the comparative cervical tuberculin tests revealed that the prevalence rates were 4. 67 % – 7. 15 %, 12. 02 % – 15. 67 % and 20. 56 % – 24. 98 % at the ≥ 4 mm, ≥ 3 mm and ≥ 2 mm cut-off points, respectively. Overall, the best test performance was realised at ≥ 3 -mm, though the ≥ 2 -mm cut-off point predicted more positive reactors. Age, sex, breed and husbandry practices served as significant (P< 0. 05) risks to the prevalence and exposure of bovine TB in cattle. The feedbacks from cattle professionals suggested that there was high possibility of cattle to cattle and cattle to human transmission of bovine TB such as intimate and repeated animal / animal and animal / human interactions, consuming unpasteurised milk and eating raw meat. Genomic deletion analysis of cultured isolates showed evidence of M. tuberculosis from cattle and M. bovis from human while spoligotyping identified five cattle M. bovis strains; and four spoligotype patterns that had not been previously described anywhere. The study has important epidemiological and public health implications requiring prompt and decisive actions from the Cameroonian authority towards controlling zoonotic bovine TB in both humans and animals. A multidisciplinary approach is needed for further collaborative research and effective control strategies such as enhancing the awareness of people to this deadly disease through continuous education, proper food handling and personal hygiene, healthy husbandry practices and maintenance of the environment.

40|$|Deterioration {{approach}} {{is used to}} predict the condition ratings of bridge elements for determining optimal maintenance strategies and estimating future funding requirements. To effectively predict long-term bridge performance, an advanced integrated deterioration method has been developed which incorporates a time-based model, a state-based model with the Elman Neural Network (ENN) and a Backward Prediction Model (BPM). The proposed method involves the categorisation of the selected <b>inspection</b> <b>records</b> by bridge components, material types, traffic volume and the construction era. The main advantage of such categorisation is to group similar components together, thereby identifying the common deterioration patterns. A selection process embedded in the proposed method offers the ability to automatically select the most appropriate model for predicting future bridge condition ratings. To demonstrate {{the advantage of the}} proposed method in predicting long-term bridge performances, case studies are performed using the New York State <b>inspection</b> <b>records</b> available from the U.

The predicted outcomes are validated by a cross-validation process, which demonstrates that the proposed method is more accurate than the standard Markovian-based procedure.
