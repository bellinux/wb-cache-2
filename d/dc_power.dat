5|$|Selenium {{is found}} in metal sulfide ores, where it {{partially}} replaces the sulfur. Commercially, selenium is produced as a byproduct in the refining of these ores, most often during production. Minerals that are pure selenide or selenate compounds are known but rare. The chief commercial uses for selenium today are glassmaking and pigments. Selenium is a semiconductor and is used in photocells. Applications in electronics, once important, have been mostly supplanted by silicon semiconductor devices. Selenium is still used in a few types of <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> surge protectors and one type of fluorescent quantum dot.|$|E
5|$|The {{array of}} a {{photovoltaic}} power system, or PV system, produces direct current (<b>DC)</b> <b>power</b> which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity. For practical use this usually requires conversion to certain desired voltages or alternating current (AC), {{through the use}} of inverters. Multiple solar cells are connected inside modules. Modules are wired together to form arrays, then tied to an inverter, which produces power at the desired voltage, and for AC, the desired frequency/phase.|$|E

5|$|In some countries, the {{nameplate}} {{capacity of a}} photovoltaic power stations is rated in megawatt-peak (MWp), which refers to the solar array's <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> output. However, Canada, Japan, Spain and {{some parts of the}} United States often specify using the converted lower nominal power output in MWAC; a measure directly comparable to other forms of power generation. A third and less common rating is the mega volt-amperes (MVA). Most solar parks are developed at a scale of at least 1MWp. As at the start of 2017, the world's largest operating photovoltaic power station has a capacity of over 800 megawatts and projects up to 1 gigawatt are planned. As at the end of 2016, about 4,300 projects with a combined capacity of 96GWAC were solar farms larger than 4MWAC.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> supply.|$|E

25|$|In medium-power {{transmission}} applications, {{even more}} complex and sophisticated voltage sourced converter (VSC) silicon semiconductor rectifier systems, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) and gate turn-off thyristors (GTO), have made smaller high voltage <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> transmission systems economical.

25|$|Because {{electrical}} power {{is equal to}} voltage times current, the relatively low voltages in existing DC systems imply relatively high currents. If the <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> in the contact wire is to be supplied directly to the DC traction motors, minimizing resistive losses requires thick, short supply cables/wires and closely spaced converter stations.|$|E

25|$|For larger structures, {{galvanic}} anodes cannot economically deliver enough {{current to}} provide complete protection. Impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) systems use anodes {{connected to a}} <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> source (such as a cathodic protection rectifier). Anodes for ICCP systems are tubular and solid rod shapes of various specialized materials. These include high silicon cast iron, graphite, mixed metal oxide or platinum coated titanium or niobium coated rod and wires.|$|E
50|$|The ABe 4/4 III {{class was}} {{manufactured}} by the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works (SLM) and ABB in two series, {{each of three}} cars.

50|$|Wiring {{requirements}} are generally reduced {{compared to a}} conventional <b>DC</b> <b>powered</b> layout.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} the current as stray current and supplied current of the substation, on the <b>DC</b> railway <b>power</b> system. In <b>DC</b> railway <b>power</b> supply system, the running rails are usually used as the return conductor(negative-polarity) for traction load current. This condition mainly focuses on economic considerations, since it does not require the installation of an additional return conductor. But, problems of low resistance between the running rails for the return conductor and earth allows {{a significant part of the}} return load current to leak into the earth. This current is normally called to as leakage or stary current. This stary currents creates serious problems for any electrified matter in the underground. Therefore, reduction of stray current of the <b>DC</b> railway <b>power</b> supply system is also of direct benefit to the operational and safety aspects of the DC railway systems.

25|$|A commutated {{electrically}} excited series or parallel wound motor {{is referred}} to as a universal motor because it can be designed to operate on AC or <b>DC</b> <b>power.</b> A universal motor can operate well on AC because the current in both the field and the armature coils (and hence the resultant magnetic fields) will alternate (reverse polarity) in synchronism, and hence the resulting mechanical force will occur in a constant direction of rotation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The most {{critical}} component of a protection, con-trol, and monitoring system is the auxiliary <b>dc</b> control <b>power</b> system. Failure of the <b>dc</b> control <b>power</b> can render fault detection devices unable to detect faults, breakers unable to trip for faults, local and remote indication to become inoperable, etc. The auxil-iary <b>dc</b> control <b>power</b> system consists of the battery, battery charger, distribution system, switching and protective devices, and any monitoring equipment. Proper sizing, design, and main-tenance of the components {{that make up the}} auxiliary dc control system are required. Many references for stationary battery sys-tem design address only a specific battery technology, making it difficult to compare different types of batteries for their overall suitability to substation application. Also, most references do not address the particular requirements of the electrical substation environment and duty cycle. This paper provides an overall re-view of things to consider in designing the auxiliary <b>dc</b> control <b>power</b> system for an electrical substation. I...|$|R
