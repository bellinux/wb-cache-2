25|$|Why did <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> own life? Well, {{when you}} {{committed}} two double murders you would too. Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't have guessed it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E
25|$|Member of Parliament John H. Bryden {{put forward}} an {{amendment}} that would remove the sovereign from the oath altogether: In pledging allegiance to Canada, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> place among Canadians, a people united by God whose sacred trust is to uphold these five principles: equality of opportunity, freedom of speech, democracy, basic human rights, {{and the rule of}} law. Bryden's proposal was defeated in a vote of 189 to 31, and Bill C-63 itself never received Royal Assent; after approval by the House of Commons and a second reading in the Senate, the bill was under consideration by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs when a federal election was called, resulting in the bill's demise on the Order Paper. Subsequent Bills C-16 (2000) and C-18 (2002) also proposed the same changes to the Oath of Citizenship; the former also died on the Order Paper due to the prorogation of parliament, while the latter never made it past second reading in the House of Commons.|$|E
500|$|Neither the {{appellation}} of planets, {{nor that}} of comets, can with any propriety of language {{be given to}} these two stars ... They resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them. From this, their asteroidal appearance, if <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> name, and call them Asteroids; reserving for myself however the liberty of changing that name, if another, more expressive of their nature, should occur.|$|E

500|$|Following {{his return}} from the Middle East, Jackson was briefly an {{instructor}} at No.1 Service Flying Training School, based at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria. He wrote to his wife, [...] "I just loathe this joint. This training is a tough job and <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> hat off to the boys who {{have been doing it}} since war broke out... every one of these instructors is longing to be sent overseas, but I doubt if they have any chance of ever getting there—they are so valuable here." [...] In January 1942, he was posted to No.4 Squadron, which operated Wirraways in Canberra.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{for the single}} was shot in London by Moe Musa. It was released on 24 December 2012 through Iyanya's official YouTube account. The video commences with footage from the live concert in which he asks the audience: [...] "It's getting really hot in here, can <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> shirt off?". Several scenes display the singer loitering around a shopping centre, dancing in a nightclub, and driving around the city at night. He is also shown dancing with various female companions and hugging {{a few of his}} friends. The visual ends with Iyanya drinking vodka around the aforementioned ladies. Boye appreciated the clip and Iyanya for ending the year off right.|$|E
500|$|Berkowitz (real name Scott Putesky) later {{claimed to}} have been [...] "shut out" [...] of {{recording}} sessions, and alleged that other band members destroyed much of his equipment—the four-track recorder, which had been used to produce many of the band's early demos, had been microwaved, and his drum machine had been discarded. The latter was subsequently revealed to have been thrown from a second-story window. He was also highly critical of Reznor, whom he alleged destroyed a Fender Jaguar which had been given to him by his father as a child, saying: [...] "I was in the studio, and they were all in the control room, and I'm playing guitar. At the end, Trent says, 'Do it again, but do it more like this.' We went through this three times, and he says, 'Hold on. I'll come in there. Let me show you what I'm talking about.' So <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> guitar off, hand it to him—and he smashes it, just to fuck with me. Then he laughed and left the room." ...|$|E
60|$|I was so {{stung by}} this brutal remark that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> custom elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|So, waking from my {{last long}} sleep, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>my</b> {{place among the}} sheep.|$|R

2500|$|The Bureau {{alleged that}} competitors' {{executives}} met in restaurants, coffee shops and at conventions, and that Nestlé Canada CEO, Robert Leonidas once handed a competitor an envelope containing his company’s pricing information, saying: [...] "I {{want you to}} hear it from the top– <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> pricing seriously." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} {{refers to the}} ongoing Afghan war and also makes several allusions to World War I and World War II. The lyrics also criticise diplomacy, {{especially}} in the final refrain: [...] "what if <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> problem to the United Nations?" [...] This refrain {{is based on a}} lyric from Eddie Cochran's [...] "Summertime Blues" [...] and most reviews of Let England Shake recognised the similarity. Harvey was granted permission to use the lyric and noted the inclusion in the album's liner notes.|$|E
2500|$|In one of {{the first}} {{customer}} reviews, the City of Orlando, Florida, reported on their initial testing of 600 Chromebooks {{as part of a broader}} study related to accessing virtual desktops. Early indications show potential value in reducing IT support costs. End users have indicated that the Chromebook is easy to travel with and starts up quickly. One stated that [...] "If I just need to stay connected for emergencies, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> Chrome," [...] but when traveling for business she would still take her laptop. Orlando does plan to continue to use the Chromebooks.|$|E

2500|$|Rosecrans's {{performance}} {{immediately after}} the battle was lackluster. Grant had given him specific orders to pursue Van Dorn without delay, {{but he did not}} begin his march until the morning of October 5, explaining that his troops needed rest and the thicketed country made progress difficult by day and impossible by night. At 1 p.m. on October 4, when pursuit would have been most effective, Rosecrans rode along his line to deny in person a rumor that he had been slain. At Battery Robinett he dismounted, bared his head, and told his soldiers, [...] "I stand in the presence of brave men, and <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>my</b> hat off to you." ...|$|E
