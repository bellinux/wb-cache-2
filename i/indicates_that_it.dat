5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the arctometatarsus first evolved; {{it was not}} present in the {{earliest}} tyrannosauroids like Dilong, but {{was found in the}} later Appalachiosaurus. This structure also characterized troodontids, ornithomimids and caenagnathids, but its absence in the earliest tyrannosauroids <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was acquired by convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|Tafforet was {{familiar}} with the fauna of Réunion, where the related hoopoe starling lived. He made several comparisons between the faunas of different locations, so {{the fact that he did}} not mention a crest on the Rodrigues starling <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was absent. His description of their colouration is similar.|$|E
50|$|Some sources <b>indicate</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be {{identified}} by its unnaturally large or cold penis.

5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is the oldest}} house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque {{was part of a}} statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can or could harbour life. However, this is less likely than on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from the intense radiation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{behaviour}} of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items. Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct Cylindraspis land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had a complex song.|$|E

5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} {{had a profound impact}} on the structure of marine communities. The fossil record <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had a cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture the heart and lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|Nero {{opened on}} 25 February 1705, with Mattheson {{in the title}} role. Its staging so closely after Almira's run <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{probably}} composed, in part or in whole, during 1704. There are no surviving accounts of its public reception, but it clearly proved less successful than its predecessor, running for just three performances before the theatre closed for the Lenten season. When the Gänsemarkt reopened the opera was not revived, and was never performed again.|$|E
5|$|Research by Michael D'Emic et al <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was among}} the slowest-growing theropods. Based on studies of the lines of arrested growth in several bones, {{it was found that}} Majungasaurus took twenty years to reach maturity, which may have been a result of the harsh {{environment}} in which it lived. However, other abelisaurids have also been found to have comparably slow growth rates.|$|E

5|$|Taken {{together}} with the other sources above, this Hospital {{must be seen as}} a significant medieval establishment. It served a number purposes; especially the provision of a sub-monastic care home for locals. There is no clear evidence about the inclusion of women. The location of the hospital adjacent to a river crossing on the drove road <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a travellers inn. The hospital at Soutra Aisle in the Scottish Borders served a similar purpose. In addition to being a Traveller's Inn, {{it may have been a}} Chantry for the Cathedral in Old Aberdeen.|$|E
5|$|The dacite volcanics {{composing}} Mount Fee contain brown {{volcanic glass}} {{as much as}} 70% and vesicular textures as much as 15%. About 25% of the volcanics contain crystal content, including plagioclase, hornblende, orthopyroxene, orthoclase and sporadic quartz. The orthoclase crystals are interpreted to represent rock fragments that became enveloped during hardening of the dacitic lavas. A portion of the southwestern flank of Mount Fee comprises no volcanic glass, but rather composed of an abnormal cryptocrystalline matrix. This <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> might have developed {{as part of a}} subvolcanic intrusion.|$|E
5|$|Alioramus were bipedal {{like all}} known theropods, and their sharp teeth {{indicate}} that they were carnivores. Known specimens were smaller than other tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and Tyrannosaurus rex, but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both Alioramus species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur. The genus Alioramus {{is characterized by a}} row of five bony crests {{along the top of the}} snout, a greater number of teeth than any other genus of tyrannosaurid, and a lower skull than other tyrannosaurids.|$|E

5|$|Ariel {{is thought}} to have formed from an {{accretion}} disc or subnebula; a disc of gas and dust that either existed around Uranus for some time after its formation or was created by the giant impact that most likely gave Uranus its large obliquity. The precise composition of the subnebula is not known; however, the higher density of Uranian moons compared to the moons of Saturn <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may have been relatively water-poor. Significant amounts of carbon and nitrogen may have been present in the form of carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular nitrogen (N2), instead of methane and ammonia. The moons that formed in such a subnebula would contain less water ice (with CO and N2 trapped as clathrate) and more rock, explaining the higher density.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other hand is significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|Noted American {{architect}} Henry Hobson Richardson, {{known for}} his public buildings including several Boston and Albany Railroad depots, {{was hired by the}} Central Vermont in September 1885 to design the new station. Richardson likely obtained the commission through his friend and former classmate James A. Rumrill, who was a director of the railroad. New London was the last of many railroad stations worked on by Richardson before his death in 1886, though numerous others were designed by his students (including the nearby New London Public Library designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge). Many of Richardson's later attributed works were designed primarily by his office staff, but the quality of the design <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was closely supervised by Richardson. Richardson's biographer, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, considered New London to be his best station design.|$|E

5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{serve to}} help distinguish Parasola auricoma from similar coprinoid mushrooms that grow in woodchips, including {{a lack of}} deliquescence, {{and the lack of}} a veil. Microscopically, it is characterized by the long, gold-pigmented, thick-walled setae on the cap, and ellipsoid spores with a germ pore. The distinctly grooved and pleated cap margin <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella. Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P.plicatilis, P.leiocephala, P.lilatincta, and P.kuehneri. Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P.auricoma—none of them have setae on the cap.|$|E
