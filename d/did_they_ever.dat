[...] Unmounted militia would often fire from long range, {{in the hope of}} hitting somebody in the main column of soldiers {{on the road}} and surviving, since both British and colonials used muskets with an effective combat range of about [...] [...] Infantry units would apply pressure to the sides of the British column. [...] When it moved out of range, those units would move around and forward to re-engage the column further down the road. [...] Heath sent messengers out to intercept arriving militia units, directing them to appropriate places along the road to engage the regulars. [...] Some towns sent supply wagons to assist in feeding and rearming the militia. [...] Heath and Warren did lead skirmishers in small actions into battle themselves, but it was the presence of effective leadership that probably had the greatest impact on the success of these tactics. [...] Percy wrote of the colonial tactics, [...] "The rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance and resolution, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> dare to form into any regular body.

500|$|In their {{accounts}} afterward, British officers and soldiers alike noted their frustration that the colonial militiamen fired {{at them from}} behind trees and stone walls, rather than confronting them in large, linear formations {{in the style of}} European warfare. [...] This image of the individual colonial farmer, musket in hand and fighting under his own command, has also been fostered in American myth: [...] "Chasing the red-coats down the lane / Then crossing the fields to emerge again / Under the trees {{at the turn of the}} road, / And only pausing to fire and load." [...] To the contrary, beginning at the North Bridge and throughout the British retreat, the colonial militias repeatedly operated as coordinated companies, even when dispersed to take advantage of cover. [...] Reflecting on the British experience that day, Earl Percy understood the significance of the American tactics: During the whole affair the Rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance & resolution, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> dare to form into any regular body. Indeed, they knew too well what was proper, to do so. Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself much mistaken. They have men amongst them who know very well what they are about, having been employed as Rangers against the Indians & Canadians, & this country being much covered with wood, and hilly, is very advantageous for their method of fighting.|$|E
500|$|On 21 March 1816, {{at the age}} {{of seven}} years, Mendelssohn was baptised with his brother and sisters in a home {{ceremony}} by Johann Jakob Stegemann, minister of the Evangelical congregation of Berlin's Jerusalem Church and New Church. Although Mendelssohn was a conforming Christian {{as a member of the}} Reformed Church, he was both conscious and proud of his Jewish ancestry and notably of his connection with his grandfather Moses Mendelssohn. He was the prime mover in proposing to the publisher Heinrich Brockhaus a complete edition of Moses's works, which continued with the support of his uncle Joseph Mendelssohn. Mendelssohn was notably reluctant, either in his letters or conversation, to comment on his innermost beliefs; his friend Devrient wrote that [...] " [...] deep convictions were never uttered in intercourse with the world; only in rare and intimate moments <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> appear, and then only in the slightest and most humorous allusions". Thus for example in a letter to his sister Rebecka, Mendelssohn rebukes her complaint about an unpleasant relative: [...] "What do you mean by saying you are not hostile to Jews? I hope this was a joke It is really sweet of you that you do not despise your family, isn't it?" [...] Some modern scholars have devoted considerable energy to demonstrate either that Mendelssohn was deeply sympathetic to his ancestors' Jewish beliefs, or that he was hostile to this and sincere in his Christian beliefs.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "You should have seen the campus this week-end, more drunks than ever and they all claim that the year is just beginning. I'm afraid to imagine what it will be by the Ohio State game." [...] Ford's concern proved prescient. [...] After the Ohio State game, the university attracted unwanted national publicity when its board in control of athletics mailed notices to ticket holders warning that they would be ejected if complaints were received about their drinking.

2500|$|William Turpel, {{owner of}} a marine railway in Victoria, testified that his company had hauled Sechelt {{out of the water}} on March 14, 1911 to repair her propeller, which, because one blade had been lost, the {{opposite}} blade had to be removed to keep the shaft in balance. In his opinion, without plenty of ballast, the boat was too tall and narrow to be a good sea boat. Harold G. Jarvis, her surviving owner testified to the contrary, that he felt, as an experienced seaman, that Sechelt was perfectly suitable for the Victoria-Sooke run and that when he and Captain James had inspected her when she was hauled out at Turpel's yard, they both found her to be in [...] "first-class" [...] condition. He did not consider the vessel top-heavy, and stated she had made several trips just before her loss in worse weather conditions, which on the 24th he characterized as [...] "fresh" [...] but not a gale. He said that on March 24, 1911, he had been aboard the vessel before she sailed. All the cargo was stowed as low as possible on the main deck, and no cargo was carried on the upper deck, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>ever</b> carry cargo on the upper deck.
