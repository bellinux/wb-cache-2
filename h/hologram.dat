5|$|Real-time {{holography}} is {{a second}} method of creating holographic interferograms. A holograph of the unstressed object is created. This holograph is illuminated with a reference beam to generate a <b>hologram</b> image of the object directly superimposed over the original object itself while the object is being subjected to some stress. The object waves from this <b>hologram</b> image will interfere with new waves coming from the object. This technique allows real time monitoring of shape changes.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{compression}} of computer-generated transmission <b>holograms</b> through lossless schemes {{such as the}} Burrows-Wheeler compression scheme (BWCS). Ever since Gaborâ€™s discovery of holography, much research have been done to improve the recording and viewing of <b>holograms</b> into more convenient uses such as video viewing. However, the compression of <b>holograms</b> where recording is performed from virtual scenes has not received much attention. Phase-shift digital <b>holograms,</b> on the other hand, have received more attention due to their practical application in object recognition, imaging, and video sequencing of physical objects. This study is performed for virtually recorded computer-generated <b>holograms</b> {{in order to understand}} compression factors in virtually recorded <b>holograms.</b> We also investigate application of lossless compression schemes to <b>holograms</b> with reduced precision for the intensity and phase values. The overall objective is to explore the factors that affect effective compression of virtual <b>holograms.</b> As a result, this work can be used to assist in the designing of better compression algorithms for applications such as virtual object simulations, vide...|$|R

At the Hub, his team question why he left them, and he simply responds that he had found his Doctor and that he belongs at Torchwood. The team is then alerted to a death near a multi-storey car park, where the team detect energy from the Rift on the corpse. Jack, to even his surprise, gets a <b>hologram</b> message on his vortex manipulator from a person he recognises, and leaves the team to talk to him.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{pastiche}} {{of science}} fiction used as a backdrop, Red Dwarf is primarily a character-driven comedy, with science fiction elements used as complementary plot devices. In the early episodes, a recurring source of comedy was the Odd Couple-style {{relationship between the two}} central characters of the show, who have an intense dislike for each other yet are trapped together deep in space. The main characters are Dave Lister, the last known human alive, and Arnold Rimmer, a <b>hologram</b> of Lister's dead bunkmate. The other regular characters are Cat, a lifeform which evolved from the descendants of Lister's pregnant pet cat Frankenstein; Holly, Red Dwarf's computer (Series I-V, briefly in the final episode of VII, VIII); Kryten, a service mechanoid (Series II-present); and Kristine Kochanski, an alternative-reality version of Lister's long-lost love (Series VII-VIII).|$|E

The third floor {{is home to the}} Guinness World Records Museum Tokyo, a museum that houses life-size figures, photo panels and memorabilia {{depicting}} interesting records that have been authenticated by the Guinness Book. The Tokyo Tower Wax Museum, opened in 1970, displays wax figures imported from London where they were made. The figures on display range from pop culture icons such as The Beatles to religious figures such as Jesus Christ. A <b>hologram</b> gallery named the Gallery DeLux, a lounge and a few specialty stores are also located on this floor. Tokyo Tower's Trick Art Gallery is located on the building's fourth and final floor. This gallery displays optical illusions, including paintings and objects that visitors can interact with.|$|E

In Halo 3, players can carry single-use equipment power-ups that offer temporary offensive or defensive advantages. This system of single-use equipment is replaced in Reach by reusable and persistent armor abilities that remain with a character {{until they are}} replaced. The abilities are a jetpack; active camouflage; sprint; <b>hologram,</b> which creates a facsimile of the player running towards a target point; drop shield, which creates a bubble that heals those inside and protects them from {{a limited amount of}} damage; and armor lock, which immobilizes the player but grants invincibility for a brief period of time. When playing as Covenant Elites, players also have access to an evade armor ability.|$|E
5|$|Shepard and Kasumi {{travel to}} the planet Bekenstein, where Hock is {{throwing}} a party at his mansion {{for some of the}} galaxy's richest people. After getting samples of Hock's DNA from his private quarters, recording a sample of his voice, and disabling the vault's defenses, Kasumi and Shepard infiltrate the vault. As Kasumi starts cracking the graybox, the pair is detected and attacked by Hock's forces. Kasumi and Shepard eventually manage to escape in a shuttle after destroying a gunship piloted by Hock. After the mission, Kasumi accesses the graybox and sees her partner one last time. A <b>hologram</b> of Okuda reveals the data, saying that it would impact humanity's reputation if made public. He begs her to destroy the data along with his memories. Kasumi has trouble letting him go, showing that their relationship was much more than professional. Shepard can persuade Kasumi to follow Keiji's wishes or keep the data.|$|E

The Doctor, surmising their fate, warns them not even to blink around the Angels. Sally and Larry make their way to the basement of the house and discover more Angels guarding the TARDIS. The Angels attack and Sally and Larry use the Yale key to hide inside the TARDIS. The Angels surround and rock the TARDIS to try to gain entry. Once in the control room, a <b>hologram</b> of the Doctor informs them that they have a control disk with them. Larry takes a now-glowing DVD from his pocket and inserts it into the console. The TARDIS' engines engage and the ship dematerialises, leaving a panicking Sally and Larry behind. With the TARDIS gone, the Angels who were all stood around the TARDIS have been tricked into looking at each other and have become permanently frozen as statues.|$|E

Volume absorption <b>holograms</b> show much lower efficiencies. H. Kogelnik provides analytical solutions for transmission as well as for reflection conditions. A good text-book description of the theory of volume <b>holograms</b> {{can be found in a}} book from J. Goodman.|$|R
5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator <b>hologram.</b> The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E

Fontaine convinces Nog that the bar is in trouble and he needs some help with the accounts; the Ferengi uses his business knowledge to help the <b>hologram.</b> Fontaine befriends Nog and after a while tries to convince him to return to the outside world following prompting by Ezri. Nog refuses to leave, resulting in Fontaine shutting down his program and refusing to let it restart. Fontaine appears to Nog in an otherwise empty holosuite, and Nog confesses that his injury has made him fear death and the ongoing war with the Dominion. Fontaine counsels Nog, who feels strong enough to leave the holosuite and return to duty. Shortly after he resumes his role back on the station, Nog returns to Fontaine to inform him that he has convinced Quark to leave the program running continuously to allow Vic to have a life of his own.|$|E
5|$|In the foundry, Joule is able {{to analyze}} the {{prismatic}} core. She can make out voices coming from the core â€“ including her father's â€“ thus deducing {{that it is a}} transmission of sorts. Heading to Eden Tower to decrypt the core's transmission, she agrees to meet Kai there. Once reunited, they are ambushed by Victor. Kai stays behind to provide Joule the time to escape. She finds a lost crawler filled with parietal art indicating that Victor had manipulated the other corebots to attack the maintenance habitats. Corebot Duncan enters, lamenting the death of his human companion, and unites with Joule against Victor. Joule approaches Eden Tower to activate it, only to be faced with Victor and his minions. She learns that the ships, once orbiting Far Eden while waiting for its terraforming to complete, are long gone, having been destroyed by Victor. He throws Kai's prosthetic leg to the ground, proclaiming him dead. Finally, Joule bests Victor in combat and activates the terraforming system, materializing a <b>hologram</b> of her father from parts of memories hidden in the cores. In the end, it becomes clear that Kai survived his confrontation with Victor.|$|E
