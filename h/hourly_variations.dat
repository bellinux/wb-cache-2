30|$|The {{standardized}} daily rainfall anomaly {{shows that}} sometimes years with highest hourly rainfall {{could have a}} declined daily rainfall pattern below mean hourly rainfall records. This confirms that the <b>hourly</b> <b>variation</b> of rainfall distribution that determine the occurrence of flood risk is working independent of hourly, monthly and yearly rainfall distributions. The detailed monthly rainfall analysis of Dire Dawa meteorological station showed that severe and heavy rainfall was recorded in 1956, 1961, 1963, 1964, 1983, 1996 and 2010 at Dire Dawa meteorological stations. The comparison of these higher raining years with historically identified flood event years shows {{that most of these}} events have no causative relationship. However, the hourly distribution of extreme rainfall shows that the result is high for the periods identified as flood event years. This confirms that the <b>hourly</b> <b>variation</b> of rainfall distribution of Dire Dawa station is precipitating the cause of flash flood in and around city boundaries. This can be seen by considering the hourly rainfall distribution of 2006 which was known for its devastating flood hazards. For example, the 61  mm/hr. amount of rainfall recorded in 2006 confirms that the figure represents the highest ever record of hourly rainfall during the study period at all stations (Fig.  5). This implies that the <b>hourly</b> <b>variation</b> of rainfall condition of this station is a potential cause for flood hazards of the city.|$|R

40|$|The {{information}} on climate variations {{is essential for}} the research of many subjects, such as the performance of buildings and agricultural production. However, recorded meteorological data are often incomplete. There may be a limited number of locations recorded, while the number of recorded climatic variables and the time intervals can also be inadequate. Therefore, the hourly data of key weather parameters as required by many building simulation programmes are typically not readily available. To overcome this gap in measured information, several empirical methods and weather data generators have been developed. They generally employ statistical analysis techniques to model the variations of individual climatic variables, while the possible interactions between different weather parameters are largely ignored. Based on a statistical analysis of 10 years historical hourly climatic data over all capital cities in Australia, this paper reports on the finding of strong correlations between several specific weather variables. It is found that there are strong linear correlations between the <b>hourly</b> <b>variations</b> of global solar irradiation (GSI) and dry bulb temperature (DBT), and between the <b>hourly</b> <b>variations</b> of DBT and relative humidity (RH). With an increase in GSI, DBT would generally increase, while the RH tends to decrease.

30|$|Recently, Dobra et al. {{proposed}} an unsupervised behavioral anomaly detection system that identifies days and locations with unusual calling or mobility behavior {{without knowing the}} event [39]. The authors used mobile phone records from Rwanda in order to connect the identified anomalous days and locations with extensive records of violent and political events (e.g., protests, violence against civilians) and natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes). Specifically, they computed the aggregated daily mobility and calling patterns of each site, starting from the individual behavior of all assigned subscribers for the corresponding site. This methodology suffers from high computational costs and works only on a daily basis. Our approach instead takes as input the calling volume of a cell tower without accessing individual data.

40|$|This study reports {{results of}} an {{investigation}} into the relationship of outdoor and indoor air quality in Bangkok's shop and office buildings, over a 12 months period. Four ambient air monitoring stations in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) were chosen, based on traffic density, flow conditions and wind speed. In order to characterize the indoor air quality, four shops and four office buildings in Bangkok were selected for this study. A quantitative analysis of the <b>hourly</b> <b>variation</b> of outdoor/indoor pollutants was performed. The investigated pollutants are carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PMro) and nitrogen dioxide (I. JOr). Factors, which are considered, include diurnal variations in concentrations of various pollutants and ratios between indoor and outdoor air qualities. The <b>hourly</b> <b>variation</b> of outdoor air pollutant concentration is very well correlated with indoor air concentration. The findings show that the indoor: outdoor ratio for PM 16, CO and NO 2 are evaluated as 0. 33, 0. 51 and 0. 47, respectively. The hourly average indoor concentrations of PM;e, CO and NOz are significantly higher in the shop than in the office. The pollutant levels inside the building were due to inadequate ventilation and air infi l tration of outdoor air pollutants emitted from vehicular emissions.

40|$|Natural {{resources}} in marine and coastal areas are of crucial economic {{importance for the}} province of Newfoundland and Labrador. They sustain the livelihoods and natural heritage of communities, and provide stable income for current and future generations, provided they are well-managed. Not all fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador are fully exploited, and there are ongoing efforts to establish new sustainable industries in the province. For commercial fisheries, management requires a detailed assessment of the gear used in the fishery to ensure a sustainable industry. Assessing the effectiveness of fishing gears, and understanding the extent of fishing gear impacts on marine ecosystems, can provide unique protection for aquatic habitats and help ensure sustainability of marine species. In this study, I assessed a potential fishing gear {{for use in a}} northern stone crab (Lithodes maja: Linnaeus, 1758) fishery, and investigated how abiotic factors - water current direction, <b>hourly</b> <b>variation</b> in water current direction, turbidity and interspecific interractions, influence catch rates of this species, with the aid of an underwater video-camera.

40|$|The solar-radiation {{variation}} over horizontal surfaces {{calculated by}} the ASHRAE clear-sky model is compared with measurements for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Both model results and measurements are averaged on an hourly basis for all days in each {{month of the}} year to get a monthly-averaged <b>hourly</b> <b>variation</b> of the solar flux. The measured data are further averaged over the years 1996 - 2000. The ASHRAE model implemented utilizes the standard values of the coefficients proposed in the original model. Calculations are also made with a different set of coefficients proposed in the literature. The results show that the ASHRAE model calculations generally over-predict the measured data particularly for the months of October → May. A daily total solar-flux is obtained by integrating the hourly distribution. Based on the daily total flux, a factor Φ (< 1) is obtained for every month to adjust the calculated clear-sky flux in order to account for the effects of local weather-conditions. When the ASHRAE model calculations are multiplied by this factor, the results agree very well with the measured monthly-averaged <b>hourly</b> <b>variation</b> of the solar flux. It is recommended that these adjustment factors be employed when the ASHRAE clear-sky model is used for solar radiation calculations in Riyadh and localities of similar environmental conditions. Instantaneous, daily and yearly solar-radiation on various surfaces, such as building walls and flat-plate solar collectors, can then be conveniently calculated using the adjusted model for different orientations and inclination angles. The model also allows the beam, diffuse and ground-reflected solar-radiation components to be determined separately. Sample results characterizing the solar radiation in Riyadh are presented by using the "adjusted" ASHRAE model. King Saud Universit...|$|R
