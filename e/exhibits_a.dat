40|$|ABSTRACTWe {{examined}} the chemotactic response of eosinophils to five eosinophil chemotactic factors (ECF; ECF-PI 5, −PI 6, −PI 7, −PI 8 and -PI 9) from an established T cell line (ST 02) in 31 patients with bronchial asthma (BA). The asthmatic patients {{were divided into}} three groups according to {{the ratio of the}} chemotactic response to ECF-PI 5 and -PI 9 (PI 5 /PI 9). A type 1 response occurred when eosinophils responded to both ECF-PI 5 and to ECF-PI 9, a type 2 response occurred when eosinophils responded to ECF-PI 5 only and a type 3 response occurred when eosinophils responded to ECF-PI 9 only. Of 31 asthmatic patients, 21 <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> type 2 response, six <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> type 1 response and the remainder <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> type 3 response. In contrast, 23 of 25 healthy donors <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> type 1 response and none of them <b>exhibited</b> <b>a</b> type 2 response. This typing of asthmatic patients was apparently correlated with the clinical symptoms of the patients. All patients <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> type 1 response were diagnosed with mild and episodic asthma and none of them had taken oral prednisolone. In contrast, many patients <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> type 2 response were diagnosed with moderate, persistent and perennial asthma. Indeed, eight of these 21 patients had taken oral prednisolone. The patients <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> type 3 response were diagnosed with mild to moderate and episodic asthma, but none of them had taken oral prednisolone. Furthermore, according to the total percentage migration to five ST 02 -derived ECF, asthmatic patients were further divided into two groups: high- and low-responding groups. Sixteen of 21 patients <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> type 2 response belonged to the high-responding group, whereas all patients <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> type 1 or type 3 response belonged to low-responding group. The present results indicate that such chemotactic heterogeneity of eosinophils to ST 02 -derived ECF is closely associated with the severity of BA, particularly with regard to the necessity of steroid therapy...|$|R
