40|$|Graduation date: 1983 The U. <b>S.</b> white <b>wheat</b> {{industry}} {{relies heavily}} on export markets. Since the early 1960 s these markets have been geographically concentrated in a few countries in Asia.

The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze and evaluate the effects of variations in: U. <b>S.</b> white <b>wheat</b> price, income, domestic wheat production, the availability of other food grains, shipments of U. <b>S.</b> white <b>wheat</b> under P.

The results of the study indicate that an inelastic import demand curve for U. <b>S.</b> white <b>wheat</b> is present in both Japan and Korea. This finding along with other evidence suggest that both the Japanese and Korean governments have greatly distorted the Japanese and the Korean import demand for U. <b>S.</b> white <b>wheat.</b> In the Japanese case, import demand for U. <b>S.</b> white <b>wheat</b> is strongly affected by domestic (soft) wheat production as well as the quantity imported of Australian standard (white) wheat.

However, the theoretical and empirical conclusions {{of the effect of}} exchange rate or monetary policy are mixed so far. The primary reasons of these mixed conclusions might be because of the use of the conventional competitive framework and the weak linkage between agricultural and financial market;This study develops a new U. <b>S.</b> <b>wheat</b> model that consists of wheat trade in the imperfect competition world market and competitive domestic market, and then uses the model to measure the impacts of monetary policy on wheat trade and domestic market. The duopoly characteristic was adopted for the world wheat market. Such incorporation made this model different from the conventional competitive framework. The complete U. <b>S.</b> <b>wheat</b> model was constructed by combining the duopolistic trade and competitive domestic market together. For the assessment of the impacts of monetary policy, the U. <b>S.</b> <b>wheat</b> model was connected with the financial market via linkages of exchange rate and interest rate determination. These two rates were endogenized and the portfolio equilibrium model was employed to determine these two rates;The model was empirically estimated using annual data for the period 1965 to 1985. The estimation technique was nonlinear, three-stage least squares. Almost all estimated coefficients were highly significant and all had correct signs as theoretical expectations.

Genetic diversity among these lines was examined using genetic distance-based and model-based clustering methods, and analysis of molecular variance. Four populations were identified from the model-based analysis, which partitioned each of the spring and winter populations into two subpopulations, corresponding largely to major geographic regions of wheat production in the United States. This suggests that the genetic diversity existing among these U. <b>S.</b> <b>wheat</b> germplasm was influenced more by regional adaptation than by market class, and that the individuals clustered in the same model-based population likely shared related ancestral lines in their breeding history. For this germplasm collection, genome-wide LD estimates were generally less than 1 cM for the genetically linked loci pairs. This may result from the population stratification and small sample size that reduced statistical power. Most of the LD regions observed were between loci less than 10 cM apart. However, the distribution of LD was not uniform based on linkage distance and was independent of marker density.
