40|$|Terminal {{value is}} {{critical}} for valuation purposes because very often it is {{a large part of}} what constitutes the value of a firm. In this short note I answer and clarify some typical questions and myths related to the calculation of terminal value. They are related to the use of non growing perpetuities, inflation and real growth; the use of Net Operating Profits Less Adjusted Taxes, NOPLAT as a proxy to the Free Cash Flow in perpetuity; the use of the typical textbook formula for estimating terminal value; and the treatment of working capital <b>in</b> <b>perpetuities.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Additional models {{represent}} {{the sum of}} <b>perpetuities</b> <b>in</b> terms of earnings, growth rate, the risk-adjusted discount rate, and accounting book value.|$|R
2500|$|For example, {{stocks are}} {{commonly}} noted as trading {{at a certain}} P/E ratio. The P/E ratio is easily recognized as {{a variation on the}} perpetuity or growing perpetuity formulae - save that the P/E ratio is usually cited as the inverse of the [...] "rate" [...] <b>in</b> the <b>perpetuity</b> formula.|$|R
5|$|Further {{conflicts}} over the opium trade between Britain and Qing quickly escalated into the Second Opium War. Following the Anglo-French victory, the Crown Colony was {{expanded to include}} Kowloon Peninsula (south of Boundary Street) and Stonecutter's Island, {{both of which were}} ceded to the British <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity</b> under the Convention of Beijing in 1860.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{team won}} the tournament {{for the third time}} in 1970, {{allowing}} them to keep the real trophy <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity,</b> as had been stipulated by Jules Rimet in 1930. It was put on display at the Brazilian Football Confederation headquarters in Rio de Janeiro in a cabinet with a front of bullet-proof glass.|$|E
5|$|Between 1087 and 1089, Rufus asked Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, {{to build}} a new stone castle at Rochester. He {{established}} the current extent of the castle. Though much altered through the centuries, some parts of Gundulf's work survive. In 1127 King HenryI granted the castle to the Archbishop of Canterbury <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity.</b> William de Corbeil built the massive keep that still dominates the castle today. Throughout the 12thcentury the castle remained in the custody of the archbishops.|$|E
40|$|The author uses John Chipman Gray 2 ̆ 7 s classic treatise, The Rule Against Perpetuities, as {{the focal}} point of an {{analysis}} of legal formalism. With the advent of legal formalism, pertpetuities law was reduced to a single rule that courts applied mechanically and with little deference to policy and individualized justice. Exploring the jurisprudence of formalism, the author concludes that current change <b>in</b> the <b>perpetuities</b> doctrine is based on a rejection of the Rule 2 ̆ 7 s formalist underpinnings...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} proper {{valuation}} of perpetuities without real growth. The {{case of a}} “pure” non growing perpetuity (zero real growth and zero inflation) is of academic interest but in practice it might be difficult to find. The findings contradict what is generally accepted in the literature. In particular we examine the textbook formula for calculating {{the value of a}} perpetuity. When working with <b>perpetuities</b> we are <b>in</b> presence of a Chinese box: we have found that when working with <b>perpetuities</b> <b>in</b> a scenario of non zero inflation and zero real growth value increases with inflation. On the other hand, the textbook formula for calculating a non growing <b>perpetuity</b> <b>in</b> the same scenario under values the value of the perpetuity by relevant amounts. ...|$|R
50|$|A further {{limitation}} {{is the rule}} against <b>perpetuities</b> <b>in</b> many states and countries which prohibits long-running pre-19th-century style successions of life tenancies and may result in the premature and compensation-entitling termination of such successive life interests. In England and Wales this is fixed at one lifetime, or 80 years whichever is longer.|$|R
5|$|Creekside, a {{regeneration}} area beside Deptford Creek, {{is used for}} educational and artistic purposes, such as the Laban Dance Centre, which was designed by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron, and opened in February 2003; and the Art <b>in</b> <b>Perpetuity</b> Trust (APT) gallery and studio space. A record label, Deptford Fun City Records {{was set up by}} Miles Copeland III, brother of Stewart Copeland, in the late 1970s as an outlet for Deptford bands such as Alternative TV and Squeeze.|$|E
5|$|From 1882 to 1886, Glentoran used Ormeau Park {{as their}} home ground. They moved to Westbourne in Ballymacarrett {{for six years}} until 1892. They then moved to The Oval. Initially it was on Dee Street, however in 1903 The Oval's pitch was rotated 90 degrees to its current location. During the early 20th century, the land on which The Oval stood was given <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity</b> to Glentoran by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Daniel Dixon.|$|E
5|$|Germany is a federal, parliamentary, {{representative}} democratic republic. The German {{political system}} operates under a framework {{laid out in}} the 1949 constitutional document known as the Grundgesetz (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both chambers of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, {{and the rule of law}} are valid <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity.</b>|$|E
40|$|Capital flight aggravates {{resource}} {{constraints and}} contributes to undermine long-term economic growth. Counterfactual calculations on the Philippines suggest that capital flight contributed to lower the quality of long-term economic growth. Sustained capital flight over three decades means that capital flight had a role for the Philippines to lose the opportunities to achieve economic takeoff. Unless decisive policy actions are taken up to address enduring capital flight and manage the macroeconomy more effectively, the Philippines remains caught <b>in</b> the <b>perpetuity</b> of crises, its economy hollowed-out, the people trapped in poverty, and once again, the country is frustrated from realizing a takeoff. ...|$|R
50|$|In the 1980s, Martin was {{involved}} in critical debates over the positive confession success theology (also called Word of Faith) of Christian charismatic teachers such as Kenneth Copeland and Kenneth Hagin. While Martin was critical of these teachers' claims concerning their views of Christ, healing, faith, and prosperity, he believed <b>in</b> the <b>perpetuity</b> of charismatic spiritual gifts in the Church. To that end, Martin presented his positive appraisal of spiritual gifts in several audio lectures (waltermartin.com), and by editing with chapter end-notes, a fresh reprint edition of 19th century evangelist Dwight L. Moody's book Secret Power.|$|R
60|$|The {{decision}} {{which time}} pronounces upon {{the reputation of}} authors, and upon the permanent rank which they are to hold in the estimation of posterity, is unerring and final. Restore to them that <b>perpetuity</b> <b>in</b> the property of their works, of which the law has deprived them, and the reward of literary labour will ultimately be in just proportion to its deserts.|$|R
5|$|The Lt. Michael P. Murphy Award in Geospatial Intelligence recognizes {{achievement}} by a Penn State {{graduate student}} who is serving or has served in the U.S. Armed Forces or with the U.S. Intelligence Community and demonstrated exceptional contributions to the discipline.

5|$|Despite the opposition, on 30 June 1852 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Act 1852 was passed, {{giving the}} Brookwood scheme Parliamentary consent to proceed. The former Woking Common at Brookwood, {{owned by the}} Earl of Onslow, {{was chosen as the}} site for the new cemetery. To prevent the LSWR from {{exploiting}} its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity</b> and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but did not specify details of how the funeral trains were to operate.|$|E
5|$|He {{also sought}} to build ties with {{continental}} churches. Cenwald was a royal priest before his appointment as Bishop of Worcester, and in 929 he accompanied two of Æthelstan's half-sisters to the Saxon court so that the future Holy Roman Emperor, Otto, could choose one of them as his wife. Cenwald went on to make a tour of German monasteries, giving lavish gifts on Æthelstan's behalf and receiving in return promises that the monks would pray for the king and others close to him <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity.</b> England and Saxony became closer after the marriage alliance, and German names start to appear in English documents, while Cenwald kept up the contacts he had made by subsequent correspondence, helping the transmission of continental ideas about reformed monasticism to England.|$|E
50|$|The Act {{resulted}} from a Law Commission report published in 1998. It abolishes the rule against <b>perpetuities</b> <b>in</b> most non-trust contexts, such as easements. In relation to wills, however, the Act only applies to wills drawn up after 6 April 2010. A will drawn up before 6 April but executed later (upon {{the death of the}} testator) will continue to be bound by prior rules.|$|R
30|$|Cost {{sensitive}} classification generally {{works in}} a static framework, and does not explicitly address the timeliness of predictions. Applications require a classification system to perform over the duration of their deployment. Domingos [9] considers the feasibility of implementing a cost model for machine learning systems, and illustrates a net-present-value investment-return model until <b>perpetuity.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we consider a dollar-value based cost, {{but it can be}} easily modified to other cost considerations as well.|$|R
25|$|While {{parts of}} various decrees still remain in force, the {{majority}} of the Takkanot Shum are no longer considered in force by most Ashkenazic Jewry. The decrees were instituted to deal with specific religious and sociological problems of the time, and were not considered to be placed <b>in</b> force for <b>perpetuity,</b> but for only as long as such issues existed. However, there are two specific decrees still considered active today: the Dowry takkana and the Chalitzah takkana.|$|R
5|$|In 1341, King Edward III visited Norwich for a jousting tournament, {{coinciding with}} the {{completion}} of the city's defensive walls. Edward and his mother, Isabella of France, were very impressed by the city and, as a token of appreciation for bearing the costs of the defensive fortifications, Edward granted the franchise of the market to the city <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity.</b> The control by the King's Clerk over trade at the market was ended and tolls and rents from the market from then on went directly to the city's bailiffs (the rulers of the city).|$|E
5|$|In 1839, threats by the {{imperial}} court of Qing to place sanctions on opium imports caused diplomatic friction with the British Empire. Tensions escalated into the First Opium War. The Qing admitted defeat when British forces captured Hong Kong Island on 20 January 1841. The island was initially ceded under the Convention of Chuenpi {{as part of}} a ceasefire agreement between Captain Charles Elliot and Governor Qishan. A dispute between high-ranking officials of both countries, however, led to the failure of the treaty's ratification. On 29 August 1842, Hong Kong Island was formally ceded <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity</b> to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland under the Treaty of Nanking. The British officially established a Crown colony and founded the City of Victoria in the following year.|$|E
5|$|Items of {{jewellery}} {{made before}} the death of Queen Victoria in 1901 are regarded as heirlooms owned by the Queen in right of the Crown and pass from one monarch to the next <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity.</b> Objects made later, including official gifts, can also be added {{to that part of}} the Royal Collection at the sole discretion of the monarch. It is not possible to say how much the collection is worth because the jewels have a rich and unique history, and they will likely never be sold on the open market.|$|E
50|$|The Vale of Towy (Leasing) Act {{came into}} force on 2 August 1858 and {{authorised}} the Llanelly Railway and Dock Company to lease the Vale of Towy line. The lease was for an initial ten years with an option later to extend it. In fact the LR&DC became alarmed that other railway companies were taking {{an interest in}} the Vale of Towy, and they included conversion of the lease term to <b>perpetuity</b> <b>in</b> a general Act they obtained on 23 July 1860.|$|R
40|$|India {{possesses}} {{several advantages}} {{due to its}} varied ecological range and agro-climates to cultivate several important and diverse commercial food commodities ranging from cereals, fruits and spices to medicinal plants. The country has abundance of human resource comprising skilled, educated, technical and scientific manpower {{on one hand and}} unskilled manpower on the other. Forests- and agriculture-based industries are a major source of employment in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors all over the country. This article has presented a brief overview of the potential of forest and agriculture in generating employment, providing livelihood and environmental services, sequestration of green house gases, carbon trading, rehabilitation of degraded lands, production of fuel wood, etc. There are clear linkages and synergies between agricultural production and sustainable forest management. If the sustainability of the agriculture and forests can be assured, food security and employment generation would go <b>in</b> long-term <b>perpetuity.</b> 1...|$|R

5|$|On 30 June 1852 the {{promoters}} of the Brookwood scheme were given Parliamentary consent to proceed, and the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company (LNC) was formed. The former Woking Common near Brookwood, {{owned by the}} Earl of Onslow, {{was chosen as the}} site for the new cemetery. To prevent the LSWR from exploiting its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity</b> and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but did not specify detail of how the funeral trains were to operate.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{encouraged}} intermarriage {{with the}} local population, and strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church. In 1560, they started proselytising the local Koli, Kunbi, Kumbhar population in Mahim, Worli, and Bassein. These Christians were referred to by the British as Portuguese Christians, though they were Nestorian Christians who had only recently established ties with the Roman Catholic Church. During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. After Antonio Pessoa's death in 1571, a patent was issued which granted Mazagaon <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity</b> to the Sousa e Lima family. The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575.|$|E
5|$|The {{civil war}} {{ended with the}} Treaty of Winchester, late in 1153, which {{provided}} that Matilda's son Henry would succeed Stephen after his death. When Stephen died the next year, this became a lasting peace. In {{the last year of}} Stephen's reign, in mid-1154, Chesney acquired the right to operate a mint in the town of Newark, granted <b>in</b> <b>perpetuity.</b> But as there are no surviving coins, it seems that the mint was not in operation for long. Chesney also acquired the right of justice in the city of Lincoln, and was involved in the commercial life of his diocese, establishing a fair in the town of Banbury in 1154.|$|E
50|$|A {{perpetuity}} is an annuity {{that has}} no end, or a stream of cash payments that continues forever. There are few actual <b>perpetuities</b> <b>in</b> existence (the United Kingdom (UK) government has issued them in the past; these were known as consols and finally redeemed in 2015). Real estate and preferred stock are among some types of investments that affect {{the results of a}} perpetuity, and prices can be established using techniques for valuing a perpetuity. Perpetuities are but one of the time value of money methods for valuing financial assets. Perpetuities are a form of ordinary annuities.|$|R
5000|$|In 2005, the {{universities}} endowment earned a rate-of-return of 17%, bringing {{the value of}} the endowment up to $11.2 billion (up from $9.9 billion a year ago). According to the Princeton University Investment Company the endowment had a compound rate-of-return of 15.6% over the ten years of 1995 to 2005. Golden said of the achievement: “When you have a mission to preserve purchasing power into <b>perpetuity,</b> <b>in</b> some sense a year is a pretty short period of time,” Golden said. “Seventeen percent is gratifying, but we take that in stride, just as we would take in stride a 2 percent year.” ...|$|R
40|$|Cyberculture and {{cyberspace}} {{have become}} part of our realities. This is an inescapable fact. Their digital technologies have come to underpin many aspects of our lives, our history, and our future. Already, these technologies exert considerable influence upon the institutions and structure of our societies, including those that define our concepts of art and aesthetics, our social interactions, societal and individual remembrance, even how we govern and are governed. Cyberculture’s ubiquity raises questions of our concepts of being and aloneness. Can we experience solitude if we are all connected? Will the natural state of being soon be ‘always on, always connected?’ To remember everything, is it a blessing or a curse? Is the promise of digital ‘immortality’ possible or even desirable? When do we cease mourning, if the dead are memorialized <b>in</b> digital <b>perpetuity?</b> Within this volume is a collection of essays from an international group of scholars, artists, and practitioners who address these and other questions about our future, looking at where we have come in our past...|$|R
