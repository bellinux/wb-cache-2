Especially {{in the early years}} of the breed's history, some {{inbreeding}} occurred, both by accident and design, which served to reinforce the breed's dominant characteristics. During the 1980s and 1990s, several studies were conducted to examine morphological <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> the breed lines. Significant differences were found in some characteristics, including height and proportions; these have been used to help achieve breeding objectives, especially in Italy during the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|Contrasting Bogaert's 1% figure, a {{study by}} Aicken et al., {{published}} in 2013, suggests that, based on Natsal-2 data from 2000-2001, the prevalence of asexuality in Britain is only 0.4% for people {{between the ages of}} 16-44. This percentage indicates a decrease from the 0.9% figure determined from the Natsal-1 data collected on the same age-range a decade earlier. A 2015 analysis by Bogaert also found a similar decline between the Natsal-1 and Natsal-2 data. Aicken, Mercer, and Cassell found some evidence of ethnic <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> respondents who had not experienced sexual attraction; both men and women of Indian and Pakistani origin had a higher likelihood of reporting a lack of sexual attraction.

5|$|Due to {{political}} <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> factions in the Polish exile government, and in particular, SZP {{ties to the}} Sanacja regime which dominated the Polish government since mid-1920s, the SZP was reorganized into the Union of Armed Struggle (Związek Walki Zbrojnej, ZWZ) on 13 November 1939. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski supported that move, aiming to include parties marginalized by the Sanacja regime, and supported {{the formation of the}} Main Political Council (Główna Rada Polityczna, GRP). Sikorski named General Kazimierz Sosnkowski the head of the ZWZ and Colonel Stefan Rowecki was appointed the commander of the ZWZ German occupation zone. Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski became the commander of the ZWZ Soviet zone, but was arrested in March 1940 by the Soviets when attempting to cross the new German-Soviet border. In June Sikorski appointed Rowecki as the commander of both zones.|$|E

He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, Argentinean {{zoologist}} Elio Massoia {{suggested that}} Winge's Hesperomys simplex {{and the living}} Pseudoryzomys wavrini are in fact the same species. In a 1991 study, American zoologists Voss and Myers confirmed this suggestion after re-examining Winge's material, finding no appreciable <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> specimens of H. simplex and P. wavrini. Since then, the species has been known as Pseudoryzomys simplex (Winge, 1887), because simplex is the oldest specific name for the animal; Oryzomys wavrini Thomas, 1921, and Pseudoryzomys wavrini reigi Pine and Wetzel, 1975, are junior synonyms. Voss and Myers also re-evaluated the relationships of Pseudoryzomys; they considered it closer to oryzomyines than to phyllotines, but declined to formally place it in Oryzomyini {{in the absence of}} explicit phylogenetic justification for such a placement.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{actors in}} total have portrayed Bond on film. Following Connery's portrayal, David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig have assumed the role. These screen {{versions}} have retained many traits from Fleming's depiction, {{although some of}} Bond's less fashionable attitudes have been dropped, such as racism, homophobia, retaining {{the services of a}} maid, and in the more recent films, smoking. Despite playing the same character, there have been notable <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> the portrayals. Daniel Craig is the incumbent Bond in the long-running Eon series, and played the part for a fourth time in the latest film, Spectre, released in October 2015. Daniel Craig will return as Bond in the 25th instalment of the series. The film is expected to release in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Today, Nahuan {{languages}} are spoken in scattered communities, mostly {{in rural areas}} throughout central Mexico and along the coastline. There are considerable <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> varieties, and some are mutually unintelligible. Huasteca Nahuatl, with over onemillion speakers, is the most-spoken variety. They all {{have been subject to}} varying degrees of influence from Spanish. No modern Nahuan {{languages are}} identical to Classical Nahuatl, but those spoken in and around the Valley of Mexico are generally more closely related to it than those on the periphery. Under Mexico's General Law of Linguistic Rights of the Indigenous Peoples promulgated in 2003, Nahuatl and the other 63 indigenous languages of Mexico are recognized as lenguas nacionales ("national languages") in the regions where they are spoken, enjoying the same status as Spanish within their region.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{scientists}} discovered several {{different forms of}} meats ants, forming the Iridomyrmex purpureus species group; three forms were identified (the regular I. purpureus {{and the other two}} forms I. sanguineus and I. viridiaeneus), differing in colour and nest structure. However, as there were no clear morphological <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> these variations, the taxonomic status and evolutionary relationship of these ants remained uncertain. Colouration varies from ants with a red head and thorax and a blue metallic sheen, to those with a yellowish body and a bluish-purple gaster. Others may be darker, appearing metallic-bluish to purplish-black. Owing to their different geographical ranges, the behaviour and ecology of these forms differentiated, based on examinations where multiple forms were sympatric. Each form had its own geographical limit, although the regular I. purpureus form is very common, inhabiting at least one-third of the Australian continent. Some forms may be dominant in certain habitats; for example, one form may be widespread throughout moist environments in dry areas, and others in cool and dry areas.|$|E
5|$|Since many {{materials}} can form crystals—such as salts, metals, minerals, semiconductors, {{as well as}} various inorganic, organic, and biological molecules—X-ray crystallography has been fundamental {{in the development of}} many scientific fields. In its first decades of use, this method determined the size of atoms, the lengths and types of chemical bonds, and the atomic-scale <b>differences</b> <b>among</b> various materials, especially minerals and alloys. The method also revealed the structure and function of many biological molecules, including vitamins, drugs, proteins and nucleic acids such as DNA. X-ray crystallography is still the chief method for characterizing the atomic structure of new materials and in discerning materials that appear similar by other experiments. X-ray crystal structures can also account for unusual electronic or elastic properties of a material, shed light on chemical interactions and processes, or {{serve as the basis for}} designing pharmaceuticals against diseases.|$|E

The {{secondary}} coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs; the bars on the primaries are on the outerwebs only, but darker and more noticeable. The retrices are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail. The white supercilious streak borders thinly with a black above and below, and extends above and beyond its shoulders. The ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish-black. Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest, flank and belly, though the latter two are of a warmer color. The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color. Its iris is reddish-brown, the upper mandible is lemon-colored and paler at the base and lower mandible. The legs are flesh-colored.|$|E
