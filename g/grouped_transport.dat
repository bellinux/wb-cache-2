40|$|<b>Group</b> <b>transport</b> is {{performed}} in many natural systems {{and has become}} a canonical task for studying cooperation in robotics. We simulate a system of simple, insect-like robots that can move autonomously and grasp objects as well as each other. We use artificial evolution to produce solitary <b>transport</b> and <b>group</b> <b>transport</b> behaviors. We show that robots, even though not aware of each other, can be effective in <b>group</b> <b>transport.</b> <b>Group</b> <b>transport</b> can even be performed by robots that behave as in solitary transport. Still, robots engaged in <b>group</b> <b>transport</b> can benefit from behaving differently from robots engaged in solitary <b>transport.</b> The best <b>group</b> <b>transport</b> behaviors yielded by half of the evolutions let robots organize into self-assembled structures. This provides evidence that self-assembly can provide adaptive value to individuals that compete in an artificial evolution based on task performance. We conclude the article by discussing potential implications for evolutionary biology and robotics.
