40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to review published data on the carcinogenicity of asbestos fibres with regard to the elucidation of a potential risk originating from exposure to man-made vitreous fibres (MMVF). Steps in the comparison of the two fibre classes are characterization of the fibres, pulmonary deposition, biodurability and biopersistence and a review of the cancer risk from asbestos fibres after <b>inhalation</b> in <b>rats</b> and humans. Various dust samples of chrysotile, crocidolite, and amosite were used as reference materials in studies with experimental animals. These fibres are normally thinner and shorter than MMVF. These differences in dimensions cause differences in. the deposition in the airways. In addition, significant dissimilarities exist in the deposition pattern between rats and humans. Data from biopersistence studies show that focusing only on fibres longer than 20 æm and using weighted half-time for a characterization of risk may be misleading. <b>Inhalation</b> experiments with <b>rats</b> need fibre exposure concentrations over 100 times higher to match the lung cancer risk of asbestos workers, and about 1000 times higher to reach the same mesothelioma risk. Also, the striking difference between the low lung burden of amphibole fibres of asbestos workers with mesothelioma and the more than 1000 times higher lung burden of rats with a low mesothelioma risk demonstrates the low sensitivity of the inhalation test model for the carcinogenic potency even of crocidolite fibres. It can be concluded that the <b>rat</b> <b>inhalation</b> model is also not sensitive enough to predict the cancer risk of other fibre types for humans...|$|R
40|$|Toluene is a {{volatile}} solvent {{found in many}} household products and when intentionally inhaled results in intoxication. In <b>rats,</b> acute <b>inhalation</b> of toluene results in sedation and neurological impairments, with marked increases in ambulation and vertical behaviour during the recovery period. Previous in vitro {{research has shown that}} toluene may exert its effects by inhibiting NMDA receptors, and / or by activating GABAA receptors. To test whether modulation of these receptors are also implicated in the changes in motor behaviour and neurological impairments resulting from toluene <b>vapour</b> <b>inhalation,</b> <b>rats</b> were injected with the NMDA receptor co-agonist D-serine (1000 mg/kg i. p.), the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin (0. 05 mg/kg i. p.), or saline, and then received whole-body exposures to either 15 or 30 min of an abuse-relevant concentration of toluene vapour (~ 5000 ppm). Open field behaviours including locomotion, rearing, and grooming as well as neurological impairments were quantified before and after toluene vapour inhalation. The results indicate that D-serine increases the speed of recovery from ambulatory and neurological impairments following 30 min (but not 15 min) exposure to toluene, suggesting an important role for NMDA receptors in the behavioural impairments induced by prolonged toluene intoxication. In contrast, picrotoxin did not affect recovery from toluene intoxication, suggesting that GABAA receptors are not implicated in the effects of toluene vapor inhalation, at least at the dose of toluene and exposure durations tested...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that {{induction}} of pulmonary toxicity by nanoparticles of the same chemical composition depends on particle size, which is likely in part due to differences in lung deposition. Particle size mostly determines whether nanoparticles reach the alveoli, and where they might induce toxicity. For the risk assessment of nanomaterials, there is need for a suitable dose metric that accounts for differences in effects between different sized nanoparticles of the same chemical composition. The aim of the present study is to determine the most suitable dose metric to describe the effects of silver nanoparticles after short-term <b>inhalation.</b> <b>Rats</b> were exposed to different concentrations (ranging from 41 to 1105 μg silver/m 3 air) of 18, 34, 60 and 160 nm silver particles for four consecutive days and sacrificed at 24 h and 7 days after exposure. We observed a concentration-dependent increase in pulmonary toxicity parameters like cell counts and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. All results were analysed using the measured exposure concentrations in air, the measured internal dose in the lung and the estimated alveolar dose. In addition, we analysed the results based on mass, particle number and particle surface area. Our study indicates that using the particle surface area as a dose metric in the alveoli, the dose-response effects of the different silver particle sizes overlap for most pulmonary toxicity parameters. We conclude that the alveolar dose expressed as particle surface area is the most suitable dose metric to describe the toxicity of silver nanoparticles after inhalation...|$|R

Both cellulose fibres and the positive control fibre, crocidolite asbestos, were administered in doses ranging from 104 to 108 fibres and caused marked, dose-dependent recruitment of inflammatory cells to the mouse peritoneal cavity, which was highest 1 day following injection. Crocidolite {{was much more}} active than cellulose, despite the mass dose of cellulose being 66 times greater for an equivalent number of fibres. Crocidolite at the higher doses caused inflammation to persist through 7 days. For the <b>inhalation</b> study, <b>rats</b> were exposed daily, 5 days per week, to aerosols of cellulose dust for ca. 3 weeks at a concentration of 1000 fibres ml- 1. Inhalation exposure induced an early inflammatory response in rat lungs, as determined by bronchoalveolar lavage, which peaked at 1 day following the start of inhalation and thereafter declined, despite a further 13 days of exposure {{over a period of}} 18 calendar days. In vitro production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) by lavaged alveolar macrophages was markedly depressed {{by the end of the}} exposure period in cellulose-exposed animals, compared to sham-exposed controls, and this effect was still present in rats that had been allowed to recover for 28 days beyond the end of exposure.

40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight cyclic volatile methylsiloxanes (cVMSs) are widely employed as emollients and carrier solvents in personal care formulations {{in order to}} acquire desired performance benefits owing to their distinctive physicochemical properties. Under current European legislation cosmetic ingredients such as cVMSs are required to be labeled on the product package only qualitatively, while {{for the assessment of}} environmental and consumer exposure quantitative information is needed. The aim of this study was therefore to measure concentrations of three cVMSs, namely octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D 6) in 51 cosmetics and personal care products (C&PCPs) that are currently available on the European market. The list of selected articles comprised a variety of hair and sun care products, skin creams and lotions, deodorants including antiperspirants, liquid foundations and a toothpaste. The target compounds were extracted from the products with different organic solvents dependent on the product matrix, followed by gas chromatography analysis with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). D 5 was the predominant cVMS with the highest mean and median concentrations in all the C&PCP categories. The median concentrations of D 5, D 6 and D 4 were 142, 2. 3 and 0. 053 mg/g in deodorants/antiperspirants (n= 11); 44. 6, 30. 0 mg/g and below the limit of quantification (<LOQ; LOQ for D 4 = 0. 00071 mg/g) in cosmetics (n= 5); 8. 4, 0. 32 mg/g and <LOQ in skin care (n= 16); 9. 6, 0. 18 and 0. 0055 mg/g in hair care (n= 10); and, 34. 8, 0. 53 and 0. 0085 mg/g in sun care (n= 8) products, respectively.

40|$|Asphalt fumes {{are complex}} {{mixtures}} of various organic compounds, including {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs). PAHs require bioactivation by the cytochrome P- 450 monooxygenase system to exert toxic/carcinogenic effects. The present study was carried out to characterize the acute pulmonary inflammatory responses and the alterations of pulmonary xenobiotic pathways in rats exposed to asphalt fumes by <b>inhalation.</b> <b>Rats</b> were exposed at various doses and time periods to air or to asphalt fumes generated at paving temperatures. To assess the acute damage and inflammatory responses, differential cell counts, acellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were determined. Alveolar macrophage (AM) function was assessed by monitoring generation of chemiluminescence and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin- 1. Alteration of pulmonary xenobiotic pathways was determined by monitoring the protein levels and activities of P- 450 isozymes (CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 2 B 1), glutathioneS-transferase (GST), and NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase (QR). The results show that acute asphalt fume exposure did not cause neutrophil infiltration, alter LDH activity or protein content, or affect AM function, suggesting that short-term asphalt fume exposure did not induce acute lung damage or inflammation. However, acute asphalt fume exposure significantly increased the activity and protein level of CYP 1 A 1 whereas it markedly reduced the activity and protein level of CYP 2 B 1 in the lung. The induction of CYP 1 A 1 was localized in nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells, alveolar septa, and endothelial cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cytosolic QR activity was significantly elevated after asphalt fume exposure, whereas GST activity was not affected by the exposure. This induction of CYP 1 A 1 and QR with the concomitant down-regulation of CYP 2 B 1 after asphalt fume exposure could alter PAH metabolism and may lead to potential toxic effects in the lung...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{introduce}} {{a model of}} equipment for <b>inhalation</b> anesthesia in <b>rats</b> that offers better control of both flow and losses of ether during induction, maintenance, and recuperation. METHODS: The equipment consists of an air compressor with two outlets, a closed glass induction chamber, a glass reservoir for the anesthetic agent, a pediatric inhalation mask, a three-way stopcock, a Y-connector, and urinary catheters. Three hundred Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus albinus) were given inhalation anesthesia. The evaluated parameters were equipment operation, duration of each phase of anesthesia, corneal reflex, muscular tonus, respiration during induction and maintenance, and volume of anesthesia. RESULTS: The average time taken for induction was 7. 3 minutes; the average anesthetic recuperation time was 6. 4 minutes. The amount of anesthetic used varied according to {{the weight of the}} animal, with the average volume of ether used being 6. 5 ml/hour. The availability of oxygen (room air) decreased the recuperation time and averted both respiratory depression and insufficient depth of anesthesia.

40|$|A summary {{is given}} of the biopersistence and {{pathology}} after <b>inhalation</b> by <b>rats</b> {{of two different}} Man-made Vitreous Fibres, MMVF 21 (traditional stone wool) and MMVF 34 (HT stone wool), {{and the results are}} discussed in relation to biopersistence measured after intra-tracheal instillation. The results are given from a short-term inhalation biopersistence study, a completed chronic inhalation study, and interim results from an on-going chronic inhalation study. In both the short-term and chronic studies, laboratory rats were exposed by nose-only inhalation to well-characterised fibre test atmospheres that had been selected to be largely rat respirable. The short-term inhalation study included groups exposed to aerosols targeted at 150 fibres longer than 20 //m per cm 3. The exposure duration was 6 hours/day for 5 days, with subsequent post-exposure periods lasting up to 12 months. For lung burden analyses, interim sacrifices were performed at regular intervals. The ongoing chronic study comprises a group of rats exposed to the MY 1 VF 34 fibre at one exposure level of 30 mg/nr The negative control group is filtered air. The exposure duration is 6 hours/day, 5 days/week for 2 years, with a subsequent post-exposure period lasting until approximately 20...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [Sulfur mustard (HD) is an {{alkylating agent}} that reacts rapidly with {{macromolecular}} targets {{resulting in the}} formation of stable adducts providing depots for markers of exposure. The {{purpose of this study was}} to validate an analytical procedure for detection of HD-plasma protein adducts and to establish the utility of the method in an HD <b>rat</b> <b>inhalation</b> study. Calibration curves were prepared in human and rat plasma at six levels of HD (12. 5 to 400 nM). Correlation coefficients for the mean data were 0. 9987 for human and 0. 9992 for rat plasma. The percent coefficient of variation (%CV) derived from the mean concentration data ranged from 0. 53 to 14. 1 % in human (n = 5) and 0. 57 to 10. 63 % in rat (n [...] 6) plasma. Intraday and interday precision and accuracy studies were conducted at three concentration levels (25, 150, 300 nM) to represent low, medium, and high concentrations of HD relative to those employed in the calibration curve. Precision and accuracy were assessed by determining %CV and % error, respectively. For intra- and interday studies, the %CVs and absolute % errors were less than 15 %. The limits of quantitation were 20. 88 nM for human and 16. 73 nM for rat plasma. In animal studies, rats received nebulized HD at six doses. The data indicate a dose-dependent relationship between maximal plasma concentrations and dose administered (R 2 [...] 0. 9728). Results from this study indicate an accurate, precise, and sensitive m thod. The method was useful in determining plasma protein adduct formation in a <b>rat</b> <b>inhalation</b> model...|$|R
40|$|Ultrafine carbon black, {{diesel exhaust}} soot, and {{titanium}} dioxide are carcinogenic at sufficient exposure levels in rat lungs. A 30 -month study {{is required to}} test properly the carcinogenicity {{of these and other}} particulates in <b>rat</b> <b>inhalation</b> studies. Carcinogenicity of the three particulate materials reviewed was shown by development of both bronchio-alveolar and squameous cell tumors. Tar/pitch condensation aerosol containing 50 ug/m 3 BaP and other polycyclic hydrocarbons was shown to be carcinogenic only on the basis of development of squamous cell tumors. Particle induced tumors arose out of a background of hyperplasia and metaplasia associated with persistent inflammation in the rat lung. The association between inflammaton-related and neoplastic events indicates a high probability of a threshold effect for particle-induced carcinogenesis in the rat lung...|$|R
