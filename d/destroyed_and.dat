5|$|Damage from Ida in Nicaragua was {{estimated}} to be at least 46million Nicaraguan córdoba ($2.12million USD). A total of 1,334 people were injured by the storm throughout the country. Final damage assessments from the Nicaraguan Government for mainland Nicaragua were completed on November12. A government report said that 283 homes were <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> 1,899 others damaged; 1,184 latrines were <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> 444 were damaged, and 476 wells were <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> 1,139 were damaged.|$|E
5|$|During Commando Hunt V (10 October 1970 to 30 April 1971) Air Force {{intelligence}} claimed 16,266 trucks <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> another 7,700 damaged {{during the}} dry season offensive. The Seventh Air Force headquarters in Saigon, chagrined by the enormity of the figures, recomputed them and lowered the estimate to 11,000 <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> 8,000 damaged. In fact, there were only 2,500–3,000 PAVN trucks operating on the trail during 1970–1971, each carrying approximately four tons of materiel.|$|E
5|$|Historian Alfred Price {{credited}} McKellar with 17 air victories, three shared destroyed, five probably <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> three damaged. Historians Christopher Shores and Clive Williams credit {{him with}} 21 air victories, three probably <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> three damaged as does E.C.R Baker. In his last combat they credit {{him with a}} possible 22nd victory, since a Bf 109 crashed {{in the area of}} his last combat and no RAF pilot made a claim. John Foreman credits him with at least 17 victories and acknowledges the unclaimed Bf 109 that crashed on 1 November 1940 near to McKellar might have been his last victory. Chaz Bowyer, another prolific historian and writer on RAF personnel credits McKellar with at least 20 victories.|$|E

In June German night fighter units claimed 22 RAF aircraft; 18 over the sea. In July 19 British aircraft were claimed for four losses. By October 1941 British loss records listed 54 aircraft of all types <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> a further 44 damaged in these operations to all causes.

5|$|Across the Irrawaddy Delta, hurricane-force winds caused {{extensive}} damage to housing and infrastructure. Haigyi Island {{was the first}} area struck by the storm. Several homes were <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> many more lost their roof there. Thunderstorms from the storm's outer bands on April28 damaged 586homes in Hlaingthaya Township. Residents described {{what appeared to be}} a tornado as the cause of the damage. The Hlaingthaya industrial zone was hardest hit, with five factories <b>destroyed</b> <b>and</b> dozens of homes having their roof torn off. Locals, however, claimed that the damage was more severe than reported by the government. Cars were reportedly tossed into the air during the storm. Two people were killed and fourteen others were injured in Hlaingthaya. The winds also downed numerous power lines, leaving many without electricity. In Labutta Township, near the southern tip of the Delta, 88homes were destroyed. In the Hinthada District, torrential rains caused flash flooding that killed 18people and left 14others missing.|$|E
