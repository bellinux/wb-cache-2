5|$|Old-style serif typefaces by Garamond and {{his colleagues}} finally fell out of use {{altogether}} {{with the arrival of}} what is now called the Didone style of printing in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, promoted by the <b>Didot</b> family in France and others. This favoured a much more geometric, constructed style of letter which could show off the increasingly refined paper and printing technologies of the period. Mosley comments: The upheavals of the Revolution coincided with the major shift in the style of printing types that is associated with the family of <b>Didot,</b> and the stock of old materials abruptly lost its value, except as scrap. Punches rust, and the copper of matrices is recyclable. All traces of the early types that had been {{in the hands of the}} trade typefounders like Le Bé, Sanlecque and Lamesle in Paris vanished completely. No relics of them were saved anywhere, except in commercial centres that had become relative backwaters, like Antwerp, where the Plantin-Moretus printing office piously preserved the collection of its founder... the term caractères de l'Université became attached by default to the set of apparently early matrices that had survived, its provenance forgotten, in the mixed stock of materials of the national printing-office.|$|E

25|$|Like most sans-serifs Akzidenz-Grotesk is 'monoline' in structure, {{with all}} strokes {{of the letter}} of quite similar width. This gives a sense of {{simplicity}} and an absence of the adornment and flourishes seen in many more decorative sans-serifs {{of the late nineteenth}} century influenced by the Art Nouveau style. Modern type designer Martin Majoor has described the general design of Akzidenz-Grotesk and its ancestors as similar in letterforms to the Didone serif fonts that were standard types in the nineteenth century, such as <b>Didot</b> and Walbaum. This is most visible in the quite folded-up apertures of letters such as ‘a’ and ‘c’.|$|E
25|$|From 1630 Ronsard was {{not again}} reprinted {{for more than}} two centuries. Just before the close of the second, however, Sainte-Beuve printed a {{selection}} of his poems to accompany the above-mentioned Tableau (1828). There are also selections, Choix de poésies - publiées par A. Noël (in the Collection <b>Didot)</b> and Becq de Fouquières. In 1857 Prosper Blanchemain, who had previously published a volume of Œuvres inédites de Ronsard, undertook a complete edition for the Bibliothèque Elzévirienne, in eight volumes. It is practically complete; a few pieces of a somewhat free character which are ascribed with some certainty to the poet are, however, excluded. A later and better edition still is that of Marty-Laveaux (1887–1893), and another that of Benjamin Pifteau (1891).|$|E
25|$|The Round Table {{takes on}} new {{dimensions}} in the romances {{of the late}} 12th and early 13th century, where it becomes {{a symbol of the}} famed order of chivalry which flourishes under Arthur. In Robert de Boron's Merlin, written around the 1190s, the wizard Merlin creates the Round Table in imitation of the table of the Last Supper and of Joseph of Arimathea's Holy Grail table. This table, here made for Arthur's father Uther Pendragon rather than Arthur himself, has twelve seats and one empty place to mark the betrayal of Judas. This seat must remain empty until the coming of the knight who will achieve the Grail. The <b>Didot</b> Perceval, a prose continuation of Robert's work, takes up the story, and the knight Percival sits in the seat and initiates the Grail quest.|$|E

25|$|Birmingham {{has been}} a centre for the {{printing}} of books {{at least as far}} back as the 1650s, and the area's earliest notable contribution to design was in the field of typography, where it achieved international importance in the 18th Century and played a prominent role in the rise of English influence in a field previously dominated by German, Italian, French and Dutch designers. William Caslon – the designer of the Caslon typefaces and the first significant English typographer – came from nearby Cradley, and almost certainly trained as an engraver in Birmingham in the years before 1716. Most notable however was the Birmingham printer John Baskerville, who designed the Baskerville typeface in 1754. The influence of this type design across Europe would be huge as one of the key milestones in the transition from the old-style typefaces of Fournier to the modern-style type of Bodoni and <b>Didot,</b> and it is a font still widely used today in applications from the logo of New York's Metropolitan Opera to the branding of the Federal Government of Canada. Several of Baskerville's employees went on to become type designers themselves, most notably William Martin, whose Bulmer typeface is also still widely used.|$|E
25|$|During those years, Barbu fathered {{six more}} {{children}} by Elisabeta: sons Alexandru and Dimitrie, daughters Fenereta, Alina, Elisabeta, and Elena. When George turned 12 in 1840, his father dispatched {{him to the}} Kingdom of France, where he enlisted at the Bollin school, then at Lycée Louis-le-Grand. During his time at Louis-le-Grand, young Știrbei met and befriended the future writer-politician Jean-Jacques Weiss, becoming his admirer and, later, his biographer and editor. Taking his Baccalauréat in August 1847, he studied in parallel at the Administrative School, Collège de France, and the Paris Law Faculty. His graduation from the latter came in August 1850, when he published with Firmin <b>Didot</b> his thesis De Condictione indebite ou Des obligations qui se forment sans contrat. He witnessed the French Revolution of 1848, and in later years emphasized its positive qualities in disputes with the more conservative politicians. This period of Știrbei's life also overlapped with a Wallachian Revolution, which toppled his uncle Bibescu from the throne. Having conceded the 1842 election to his brother, Barbu Știrbei accepted government office, but maintained his independence. He had been sidelined {{by the time of}} the revolt, keeping silent during its outbreak. However, as noted by his son, he privately resented it as an experiment in socialism.|$|E
