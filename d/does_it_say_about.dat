5000|$|As {{a related}} anecdote, in 1984, A.Q. Khan wrote that President Zia had {{appointed}} two Major Generals, Zahid Ali Akbar Khan and Anis Nawab, whom Peter Griffin {{had met in}} London in 1977 over dinner at the Kundan Restaurant, to oversee all operations. Khan's reference was to a dinner meeting in which Peter Griffin says he met a Brigadier General Anis Nawab who was described as running a project on industrializing Pakistan. [...] However, Brigadier General Anis Nawab was obviously a fictitious name, for Brigadier General {{is not even a}} rank in the Pakistan Army and there was no Brigadier or General by the name of Anis Nawab at the time. Khan has been unwilling to reveal the true identity of the mystery Brigadier General. In addition, Peter's account also has its problems. For example, why would any general travel all the way from Pakistan to meet Griffin, then jeopardize his operation by introducing himself with a fake rank that didn't even exist in his own army? Also why did he make up a rank that suggested he wasn't a general, yet allow his team to address him as a general? Also, why would Peter go ahead with the deal after it was obvious that the man had a fake rank and name? It is a very odd story and requires clarification. In addition, it is unclear how Khan knew which Generals and how many were appointed by Zia to oversee operations. After all, if General Zia had managed to conceal the identity of EME's Director General who was running the show and allowed Khan to think Director ITD was Director General EME what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Khan's knowledge of who was overseeing operations? Khan was a director (rather than a director general) at the time, the equivalent of a Brigadier in the army or a middle management executive at a large corporation. In addition he had just moved from Europe. So, it is quite unlikely that Gen Zia or anyone else would have shared with Khan how many generals were overseeing the operation or their identities. Essentially, both A.Q. Khan and Peter Griffin were misled into thinking they were dealing with a Brigadier / Brigadier General rather than a general officer with a different name.|$|E

40|$|International audience'Coping with instability' was {{certainly}} one of the main ground {{for the development of the}} " friendly societies " (England), the " sociétés de charité " (France) or the private insurance during the nineteenth century in Europe, as numerous forms of social and economic organization addressing the poor to collect and save money for burials (Trompette & Griffith, 2011). One and half a century later, private death insurance has emerged relatively unexpectedly in France, with the formation of an 'ad-hoc market' built on the alliance between insurance companies and funeral companies. How are we to assess this modern system of funeral contract, particularly compared with the historical forms which prevailed previously? What <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>says</b> <b>about</b> the social way fellow citizens pay tribute to their dead? This paper examines the funeral insurance contract as a socio-technical market device (Callon, Millo, & Muniesa, 2007; MacKenzie & Hardie, 2006; McFall, 2008), considering the various operations it contains: a valuation formula, incorporating a economic calculation (saving plan, capitalization contract) and a social valuation (the tribute to the dead); an attachment formula, with the formalization of an economic and juridical connection between heterogeneous actors - the ex-post dead, its family, an insurance company, a funeral parlour (Callon & Law, 2003; Vatin, 2009). Prolonging the hypothesis according to which markets are always linked to moralisations (even if more or less explicit) (Fourcade & Kieran, 2007), it shows to what extent these different type of death insurance carry a moral mandate and build up a solidarity in the way modern societies deal with their dead...|$|R

5000|$|Responding to the {{controversy}} Ridley defended the play, describing {{what he felt}} were double standards within the theatrical establishment, {{in that it is}} acceptable for there to be scenes of violence in classical drama but not within contemporary plays: [...] "Why is it that it is fine for the classic plays to discuss - even show - these things, but people are outraged when contemporary playwrights do it? If you go to see King Lear, you see a man having his eyes pulled out; in Medea, a woman slaughters her own children. The recent revival of Iphigenia at the National was acclaimed for its relevance. But when you try to write about the world around us, people get upset. If I'd wrapped Mercury Fur up as a recently rediscovered Greek tragedy it would be seen as an interesting moral debate like Iphigenia, but because it is set on an east-London housing estate it is seen as being too dangerous to talk about. What does that say about the world we live in? What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> theatre today?"Ridley also explained that he felt critics had disliked Mercury Fur because of its subject matter and not for the theatrical experience the play is trying to create for its audience: “I don’t think there is anything wrong with people being disturbed within the theatre at all… I think theatre is fifteen years behind any other art form... It’s still perceived as a kind of subject matter based art form. You wouldn’t go along and look at a Suzanne painting and criticize it just on the choice of apples she’s chosen to paint, you’d criticize it, and you’d judge it and experience it for the use of paint… Because we come from a basic literal tradition we still view stage plays as kind of glorified novels and we judge them purely on their subject matter, regardless of the theatrical experience of sitting there and watching the play.” Ridley also defended the depiction of violence within the story, arguing that is used for a moral purpose and that the play is more about love than violence:"The things that happen in Mercury Fur are not gratuitous, they are heart-breaking. The people may do terrible things but everything they do is out of love, in an attempt to keep each other safe. The play is me asking, 'What would I do in that position?' If you knew that to keep your mother, brother and lover safe, you would have to do terrible things, would you still do them? That's the dilemma of the play. It asks us all, 'What lengths would you go to to save the people you love?'" ...|$|E

40|$|Illness {{requires}} narration: it fulfills {{a crucial}} role in the cooperation between patient and doctor, is demanded by one’s social environment, and emerges in the identity work triggered by a medical diagnosis (which in itself constitutes a first narrative model for the ill person to accept, rework or reject). This article examines how contemporary illness narratives recount such communication and how they reflect on the possibilities and limits of narration. It triangulates three life writing texts: Verena Stefan’s Fremdschläfer (2007) about the Swiss-German author’s own experience of breast cancer, Siri Hustvedt’s The Shaking Woman or a History of my Nerves (2010), describing the novelist’s quest for knowledge about the ambiguous shaking she displays, and Paul Kalanithi’s When Breath Becomes Air (2016), which focuses on the author’s role reversal (from doctor to patient) and the approach of his death from lung cancer.

Following the pioneering works of Wilson, Nitecki, Buckland, and Capurro (plus many of the authors of this issue), researchers in LIS have increasingly turned to the efficacy of philosophical discourse in probing the more fundamental aspects of our theories, including those involving the information concept. A foundational approach to the nature of information, however, has not been realized, either in partial or accomplished steps, nor even as an agreed, theoretical research objective. It is puzzling that while librarianship, in the most expansive sense of all LIS-related professions, past and present, at its best sustains a climate of thought, both comprehensive and nonexclusive, information itself as the subject of study has defied our abilities to generalize and synthesize effectively. Perhaps during periods of reassessment and justification for library services, as well as in times of curricular review and continuing scholarly evaluation of perceived information demand, the necessity for every single stated position to be clarified appears to be exaggerated. Despite this, the important question does keep surfacing as to how information relates to who we are and what we do in LIS. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

The {{jury is still out on}} the case of Christine Angot. Since her first novel was published in 1990, she has become a prolific mainstay of the French literary scene, but her work continues to be controversial and receives widely differing responses from scholars and media critics alike. Limits and boundaries lie at the heart of Angot’s experimental oeuvre. She works both at and on literary and social borders, transgressing boundaries, challenging norms, provoking her readers. Her particular brand of life writing carries echoes of performance art, reality shows, video diaries, web blogs. This paper engages with the dynamics of the border in Angot’s work on a number of different levels. While some boundaries are clearly being transgressed, to what extent, and how, are limits also being set? What is at stake in Angot’s precarious treatment of the borderlands between text and life?
