5|$|In March, Ohioan {{returned}} 1,627 men to New York, {{mostly from}} the 348th Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 87th Infantry Division, followed by another 1,596officers and men, and 1,000homing pigeons on 16 April. Among the pigeons was Cher Ami—the only bird sent out by the Lost Battalion that was able to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> through—and 100 captured German pigeons. Cher Ami had received the French Croix de Guerre with Palm and had been recommended for the U.S. Army Distinguished Service Cross by General John J. Pershing.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer, {{with the}} help of Ned Flanders, sets out to rescue the {{children}} (driving Ned's car and sawing off part of his roof to use as a snow plough) but crashes Flanders' car into a fire hydrant, which sprays water that freezes the car in place. Homer's repeated gunning of the accelerator causes carbon monoxide to flood the front of the car. Flanders and Homer get high from the fumes and wildly hallucinate. While the trapped children go wild with power, Skinner uses the school hamster, named Nibbles, to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> to the outside world. Nibbles makes it to Ned and Homer, breaking the window and reviving them: they crash into a salt silo, melting the snow around the school and badly rusting the car but freeing the kids in the process.|$|E
25|$|Adding {{to their}} problems, the Portuguese were {{running out of}} provisions. As all Kandy was now in rebellion, nobody was willing to sell them any. Even if they managed to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> through to Colombo, they could not expect {{resupply}} from that quarter: Pedro Homem Pereira {{did not have enough}} soldiers to escort a caravan, even if he was willing to cooperate. Goa was too far away; with the remaining supplies they could not expect to hold Kandy until help arrived.|$|E

500|$|Following {{accusations of}} Satanism, Smith decided that Closed Casket {{would be the}} last album to feature such themes, and that he would no longer rap about the Devil. According to Smith, [...] "I've been able to {{entertain}} people for 20 years. I just try to uplift people now.

500|$|On {{the morning}} of November 7 Goreham {{decided that it was}} time to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> to Windsor. He sent a party of men down to the dock that morning. [...] These men, {{numbering}} about 30, were taken prisoner by Eddy's men as rapidly as they arrived due to their unawareness that Eddy had control of the ship. The Polly was then sailed to Fort Lawrence, to the east of Fort Cumberland, where the supplies were landed. [...] Sentries in the fort spotted the move, and Goreham, realizing Eddy had taken the ship, fired an ineffectual cannonade against the ship.|$|E

500|$|As American {{troops were}} sent to China to relieve the nation's legation, Hay {{sent a letter to}} foreign powers (often called the Second Open Door note), stating while the United States wanted to see lives {{preserved}} and the guilty punished, it intended that China not be dismembered. [...] Hay issued this on July 3, 1900, suspecting that the powers were quietly making private arrangements to divide up China. Communication between the foreign legations and the outside world had been cut off, and the personnel there were falsely presumed slaughtered, but Hay realized that Minister Wu could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> in, and Hay was able to establish communication. [...] Hay suggested to the Chinese government that it now cooperate for its own good. [...] When the foreign relief force, principally Japanese but including 2,000 Americans, relieved the legations and sacked Peking, China was made to pay a huge indemnity but there was no cession of land.|$|E
500|$|Author J. C. Furnas {{regretted that}} [...] "a Presidential year always makes Dooleyites feel frustrated. [...] In 1960 we need Mr. Dooley to deal {{adequately}} with {{such things as}} public-opinion polls; Mr. Truman's opinion of primaries; the spring swarming of the Kennedys in Minnesota; [...] the problem [...] whether Mr. Nixon should invite Checkers back into the act". Writing again in 1991, Furnas suggested potential Dooley targets might include the Bork and Souter confirmation hearings, and the omnipresence of blue jeans; but that an impediment to a revival of interest in Dooley was the present-day view of dialect works as demeaning. English professor John W. Lowe stated that Dooley [...] "set the model for an ethnic spokesman who could be entertaining and informative {{at the same time}} using humor to mask a subversive form of humor and <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> across. Then, the Irish made it, and they found his brogue and dialect embarrassing." ...|$|E
500|$|Nickelodeon officially {{announced}} the episode on {{a press release}} on April 5, 2010.

They {{must find a way}} to galvanize their neighbors, or it could be the end for Jellyfish Fields forever." [...] It was promoted as SpongeBob's campaign to save the jellyfish. Writer Banks told that the episode never set out to teach environmental lessons. He said [...] "When you entertain someone and make it funny, sometimes you can <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> across [...] Not that we're out here to send messages everywhere." [...] The episode featured two musical numbers, including [...] "Give Jellyfish Fields a Chance", a salute to the 1960s protest songs [...] with similarities to John Lennon's [...] "Give Peace a Chance". Banks, on the song, said that [...] " [...] sort of Bob Dylan meets John Lennon." ...|$|E

She meets with him and he impulsively takes her out on his boat, something, he says, he has never done for anyone else. The two quickly connect. Bill tells her that he is originally from Texas, but decided to move to California and buy a boat on a whim, as {{he did not want to}} be the sort of retiree who fell into boring, stagnated routines. After dinner, Bill drives her home, and they share a kiss; Bill says that he wants to see her again. Carol is giddy, until she sees the rat again.|$|R

500|$|In {{the weeks}} after the forfeit, Rainmen guard Joey Haywood recounted that the team had been {{approached}} by an unknown man at their hotel following the brawl. Haywood said, [...] "He was pacing around the lobby on his phone eyeing us. He {{then went to the}} ATM but didn't actually do anything. He went and sat in a parked car out front. We thought something was going to go down, like he was scouting us out." [...] The Rainmen promptly left on the team bus, and it was considered a motive for forfeiting the game. On the morning of May 2, two days after the brawl, Rainmen guard Forrest Fisher wrote on Twitter that he had been kicked out of his apartment without warning. He said, [...] "We were in Toronto Friday morning, and I <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> from the landlord at the apartment I stay at, telling me that my bags have been packed and all of my stuff has been moved to storage." [...] The team management, who were responsible for players' living arrangements, were largely blamed for the affair. The players also claimed that they had not been paid in more than two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Curt accompanies Steve, last year's {{high school}} student class president, and Laurie, the current head cheerleader, to the back-to-high-school sock hop. In one story line, Curt is desperate to find a {{beautiful}} blonde girl driving a white 1956 Ford Thunderbird that he sees {{en route to the}} dance: at a stoplight, she appears to say [...] "I love you" [...] before disappearing around the corner. After leaving the hop, Curt is coerced by a group of greasers ("The Pharaohs") to participate in an initiation rite that involves hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that [...] "The Blonde" [...] is a trophy wife or prostitute, but he refuses to believe either. Determined to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>message</b> to the blonde girl, Curt drives to the local radio station to ask DJ Wolfman Jack, who is omnipresent on the car radios, to announce a message for the blonde girl. Inside the radio station, Curt encounters a bearded man who tells him that the voice of The Wolfman is pre-taped from afar. The man still accepts the message from Curt to see what he could do. As he is leaving the station, Curt sees the man talking into the microphone and hears the voice of The Wolfman, and realizes the man is the actual DJ himself. Sure enough, The Wolfman eventually reads the message on the radio for [...] "The Blonde" [...] to meet Curt or call him at a number which happens to be a telephone booth. Curt waits by the telephone booth and early the next morning, he is awakened by the phone ringing. It turns out to be [...] "The Blonde" [...] who says she knows him and maybe she would see him cruising the coming night. Curt replies probably not, intimating that he decided {{to go to college and}} will be leaving that morning.|$|E

They joined the sloop [...] which was already there. There were U.S. fears that the British might try to annex California to satisfy British creditors. The British Pacific Station's squadron of ships off California were stronger in ships, guns, and men than the American ships.
