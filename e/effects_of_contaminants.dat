5000|$|EPA's Consumer Confidence Rule of 1998 {{requires}} community {{public water}} suppliers to provide customers with {{annual reports of}} drinking water quality, called Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR). Each year by July 1 anyone connected to a public water system should receive in the mail an annual water quality report that tells where your water comes from and what's in it. Consumers can find out about these local reports on a map provided by EPA. According to the science writer Elizabeth Royte these reports, written by utilities, [...] "can be flawed, and some are essentially propaganda. They report yearly averages over time and, with some contaminants, over multiple locations within a system, which can obscure spikes." [...] In addition, they don't necessarily list contaminants that aren't regulated and say nothing about contamination that may occur within the plumbing system of a building.

40|$|In {{recent years}} CFD {{has proven to}} be a {{valuable}} and powerful tool for advancing our understanding of complex multiphase flow systems arising in industrial applications. However, the predictive capabilities of this tool are determined by many factors of physical and numerical origin but in particular by the quality of the closures adopted for the description of the interface forces. The objective of this study is to use direct numerical simulations to validate and improve these closures using an improved front tracking model. We have studied the drag force on single air bubbles rising in viscous liquids over a wide range of viscosities. Dedicated experiments were conducted to validate the model and to highlight the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants.</b> The results show an excellent agreement between the numerical simulations and available analytical theory, whereas existing drag force correlations and the in-house experiments (using liquids with the same physical properties) gave a much higher drag force.

40|$|Habitat-forming {{organisms are}} {{frequently}} used as biomonitors in marine environments {{due to a}} widespread ability to accumulate toxic contaminants. Few studies, however, have considered the consequences of these accumulated contaminants on the abundant and diverse fauna associated with these habitats. In this review, we summarize research which has investigated the contamination of biogenic habitats (including seagrasses, macroalgae, ascidians, sponges and bivalve reefs) {{and the impact of}} this contamination on the habitat use, feeding behaviour and survival of associated epifauna. In many cases, ecological impacts upon epifauna are not simply predicted by levels of contamination in their habitat, but are determined by the foraging, feeding and reproductive behaviours of the inhabiting organisms. Thus, a thorough understanding of these ecological processes is essential {{in order to understand the}} <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> upon epifaunal communities. The scope of biomonitoring studies which assess the contamination of biogenic habitats should be expanded to include an assessment of potential effects upon associated epifauna.

Studies in field situations, with enough power to detect impacts, are necessary to develop {{a better understanding of}} the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> on ecological processes. Metals are a common contaminant of marine systems and can cause disturbances to assemblages. Using a new technique to experimentally deliver contaminants to microalgal assemblages, hypotheses were tested regarding the effects of zinc on microalgal biofilms growing on settlement panels in subtidal and intertidal habitats. PAM fluorometry was used to assess the amount and physiological state of biofilms on panels. Control panels deployed for 1 month in each habitat had significantly greater amounts of biofilm than those exposed to zinc. After deployment for 3 months, the results varied with location.

40|$|Human {{effects on}} {{estuaries}} are {{often associated with}} major decreases in abundance of aquatic species. However, remediation priorities are difficult to identify when declines result from multiple stressors with interacting sublethal effects. The San Francisco Estuary offers a useful case study of the potential role of contaminants in declines of organisms because the waters of its delta chronically violate legal water quality standards; however, direct <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> on fish species are rarely observed. Lack of direct lethality in the field has prevented consensus that contaminants {{may be one of}} the major drivers of coincident but unexplained declines of fishes with differing life histories and habitats (anadromous, brackish, and freshwater). Our review of available evidence indicates that examining the <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> and other stressors on specific life stages in different seasons and salinity zones of the estuary is critical to identifying how several interacting stressors could contribute to a general syndrome of declines. Moreover, warming water temperatures of the magnitude projected by climate models increase metabolic rates of ectotherms, and can hasten elimination of some contaminants. However, for other pollutants, concurrent increases in respiratory rate or food intake result in higher doses per unit time without changes in the contaminant concentrations in the water. Food limitation and energetic costs of osmoregulating under altered salinities further limit the amount of energy available to fish; this energy must be redirected from growth and reproduction toward pollutant avoidance, enzymatic detoxification, or elimination. Because all of these processes require energy, bioenergetics methods are promising for evaluating effects of sublethal contaminants in the presence of other stressors, and for informing remediation. Predictive models that evaluate the direct and indirect <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>contaminants</b> will be possible when data become available on energetic costs of exposure to contaminants given simultaneous exposure to non-contaminant stressors...|$|E
