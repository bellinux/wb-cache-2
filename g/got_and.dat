[...] The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff graded the episode B+. He called the Rachel and Shelby storyline [...] "very well-handled, another emotional story that the series is mostly nailing the execution of", and opined: [...] "Chris Colfer and Mike O'Malley (always good together) brought {{out the best in}} Cory Monteith, who sometimes struggles with the weightier stuff." [...] Overall, VanDerWerff felt that [...] "Theatricality" [...] was not as good as the preceding episode, but contained some well-executed moments and many funny lines. James Poniewozik of Time was [...] "pleasantly surprised" [...] by the episode, praising the Kurt/Finn and Rachel/Shelby storylines; however, he found the Tina, Quinn and Puck subplots [...] "ridiculous and dispensible." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{his way to}} {{the front}} lines, Bolt {{traveled}} to a number of islands as the Rochambeau stopped at New Caledonia and New Hebrides to avoid Japanese submarines. Upon arrival at Espiritu Santo, Bolt was placed in a pool of new officers who were intended to replace casualties in several squadrons. Casualties at this time proved to be less than expected, so the replacement pool was used to form a new squadron. The new unit was designated VMF-214, and became known as the [...] "Black Sheep" [...] because its pilots had originally not been assigned to a squadron. Under the command of Major Pappy Boyington, the unit was equipped with F4U Corsairs. [...] Moved after several months to the Russell Islands, they were ready for combat by 13 September. Bolt flew the aircraft every chance he <b>got,</b> <b>and</b> although new to the war in the Pacific, Bolt had over 700 hours flying in the F4U Corsair by September, more than many combat pilots accrued in two combat tours.|$|E
500|$|The {{events that}} precipitated the fight have been {{frequently}} debated, and variously interpreted. Two months earlier, {{on opening night}} of the season, the Lakers played the Milwaukee Bucks. Bucks center Kent Benson elbowed Abdul-Jabbar in the stomach, and Abdul-Jabbar {{appeared to be in}} intense pain. Abdul-Jabbar then punched Benson from behind, breaking Benson's jaw and his own hand. Washington got into a brawl with several Buffalo Braves players a few games later. In the December game, {{at the beginning of the}} game's second half, Lakers guard Norm Nixon missed a shot. Houston's Kevin Kunnert and Washington both contended for the rebound, which Kunnert eventually <b>got</b> <b>and</b> passed out to teammate John Lucas. Their battle for the rebound was more physical than usual, however. Abdul-Jabbar became involved and wrestled with Kunnert. As a result, Kermit Washington stayed behind in the backcourt in order to watch over and make sure nothing happened. After the two disengaged, Washington grabbed Kunnert's shorts in order to prevent him from getting back over on offense quickly. Kunnert threw an elbow that hit Washington on the upper arm and this move spun him around so that he was facing Washington. What happened next is disputed: Washington, several Lakers, and Rocket forward Robert Reid insisted that Kunnert punched him, Kunnert said Washington swung first after he attempted to free himself from Washington's grasp. The referee who saw the action saw merely a [...] "scuffle" [...] between Kunnert and Abdul-Jabbar followed by the one between Kunnert and Washington then Washington's punch. Both Washington and Abdul-Jabbar reject this account.|$|E

500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor because I was so happy to get what I <b>got.</b> <b>And</b> then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E

This was confirmed by Ciantar, who stated that [...] "...the town was very pleasant, due to the great quantity of olive groves, from whence it <b>got</b> <b>and</b> still retains the name Zeitun, which means olive; there is also the tradition that olive oil in abundant quantity used to be made here." ...|$|E

After the first six minutes, the Russians had an 18–3 lead, which escalated to 33–14. However, the Lithuanians' resilience made them erase the deficit by the third quarter, 52–52. Eventually, fatigue that remained from the tough quarterfinal caugh up with Lithuania, especially playing against such a powerful adversary. The Russian won 86–74, {{despite the efforts of}} Lithuanian captain Ramūnas Šiškauskas, who scored 30 points. Following the game, Šarūnas Jasikevičius declared that: [...] "We have to forget everything and endeavor to win the medals. [...] The situation of the Greeks is the same as ours.

2500|$|The Luftwaffe's {{attacks on}} Soviet railway lines had a {{tremendous}} impact on the Red Army's ability to conduct operations west of the Dnieper. It enabled the First Panzer Army to capture Bila Tserkva, south west of Kiev. The German Eleventh Army prepared to cross the Dniestr river in a northerly direction. It was soon realised the Germans were attempted an encirclement operation, and the VVS was called in. The VVS Southern Front was still engaged in Moldavia, so the battered VVS South Western Front had to be deployed. Kirponos told Astakhov, commanding the VVS formation, [...] "Take all you've <b>got</b> <b>and</b> throw it against the tanks...! Keep on attacking! This is your main task!"

2500|$|Day claimed {{afterward}} that Loeb {{had attempted}} to assault him; however, {{it may have been}} the other way around. Many doubted that Day's story was true. It was not likely that he acted in self-defense. [...] Day emerged unharmed from the attack, while Loeb sustained more than 50 wounds from the attack, including numerous defensive wounds on his arms and hands. [...] Loeb's throat had also been slashed from behind, suggesting that he was attacked by surprise. [...] Nevertheless, an inquiry accepted Day's testimony. [...] The prison authorities, perhaps embarrassed by publicity sensationalizing alleged decadent behavior in the prison, ruled that Day's attack on Loeb was [...] self-defense. According to one widely reported account, newsman Ed Lahey wrote this lead for the Chicago Daily News: [...] "Richard Loeb, despite his erudition, today ended his sentence with a proposition." [...] Some papers went as far as to say that Loeb deserved what he <b>got,</b> <b>and</b> appeared to praise James Day for his murder. [...] Day was later tried and acquitted of Loeb's murder.|$|E
2500|$|For Series 1-6, {{the final}} stage was a purely business-styled task, as a final test of a candidate's skill set and their {{suitability}} to the job being offered as a prize in these series.

Kittil Kittilsen, who left Mayhem in 1988 after becoming a born-again Christian, expressed his concern for the unblack metal musicians: [...] "I think they're completely off the mark. I cannot seriously understand how they even manage to do it. They have missed the target completely. I mean, {{if you want to be}} a Christian, be it with all you've <b>got,</b> <b>and</b> if you want to be metal, be it with all you've got. If those people really took their faith seriously, and followed the instructions of the One they profess to believe in, they would never be found in a context like that. They are on collision course with Christian life and teaching. I say this because of my own experience, and because of what is written in the Bible; rock music, metal music has nothing at all to do in a Christian setting!" ...|$|E

Happiness does not come from being rich, nor merely being {{successful}} in your career, nor by self-indulgence. One step towards happiness is to make yourself healthy and strong while you are a boy, so that you can be useful and so you can enjoy life when you are a man. Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have <b>got</b> <b>and</b> make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one. But the real way to get happiness is by giving out happiness to other people. Try and leave this world a little better than you found it and when your turn comes to die, you can die happy in feeling that at any rate you have not wasted your time but have done your best. [...] "Be prepared" [...] in this way, to live happy and to die happy– stick to your Scout Promise always– even after you have ceased to be a boy– and God help you to do it.|$|E
2500|$|Three downtempo ballads follow, called [...] "the kind {{of songs}} you wouldn't {{want to listen}} to at all: the lyrics are boring at best and {{completely}} cliché at worst" [...] by one reviewer. The first, [...] "Don't Forsake Me" [...] is a torch song that was frequently compared to [...] "Too Hurt to Dance" [...] due to its lyrics about heartache. The song follows the retro sound Duffy had been previously known for and was called [...] "indebted to the pre-Beatles era". It was received negatively for [...] "paint too much of a resemblance" [...] to [...] "Warwick Avenue". The title song, which follows, is a love song that was again said to contain 1950s music references. The song features vinyl sounds and is sung to the accompaniment of an acoustic guitar. The final song in the trio of ballads is [...] "Breath Away", a 1960s-inspired ballad about love. Contactmusic.com [...] implied that the song is boring, saying that [...] " [...] hardly does anything to take our breath away", although it was said to [...] "showcase" [...] her vocal talents. Endlessly continues with two more up-tempo songs with a dance-orientated sound: [...] "Lovestruck" [...] and [...] "Girl", both called [...] "sassy" [...] and [...] "playful". The former is a disco song described as having [...] "the brashness of a Bond theme", with [...] "tragic undertones" [...] of a [...] "haunting creation". Lyrically, the song speaks of being so in love you are [...] "sleepless all night long", with the song opening [...] "It's a physical thing we <b>got</b> <b>and</b> I'm in paradise". The lyrical sentiment of [...] "My Boy" [...] is echoed in the latter, with the song being sung [...] "Girl, girl/Stay away, girl/Come back another day, girl/Better still don't come back ever stay away from here forever." [...] The album's final song, the string-led [...] "Hard for the Heart" [...] continues the soul pop sound of Rockferry and was described as a [...] "soulful pop confection" [...] by Uncut, whilst being labelled as the stand-out song on the album by many reviewers. The song's climax was compared to the song [...] "Hey Jude" [...] (1968) by The Beatles, whilst a reviewer for the BBC asserted that it [...] "unconsciously borrows from Coldplay's [...] "The Scientist"." [...] Entertainment Focus, on the other hand called it a [...] "lost Burt Bacharach classic", and Hammond's production skills were also praised on the song. It also received praise concerning Duffy's voice, something that was a feature of many critics' reviews, with Sputnik Music noting, [...] ""Hard for the Heart" [...] has the singer in an intensely emotional and surprisingly restrained moment. Her beautiful timbre finally gets to shine without choking out the sophisticated and apotheotic production, giving pulse and strength to a strikingly poetic composition." ...|$|E
