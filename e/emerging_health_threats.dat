40|$|Most {{infectious}} diseases that recently emerged in humans originated in animals. Besides close contact between animals and humans, other factors probably {{contribute to the}} cross-species transmission of {{infectious diseases}}. It is critical to establish effective mechanisms for coordination and collaboration between the animal, human, and environmental health sectors before new threats emerge by bringing the different sectors together to tackle endemic zoonotic diseases of greatest concern. Such multisectoral partnerships should begin by identifying priority zoonotic diseases for national engagement with equal input from the different sectors. Improvements in surveillance and data sharing for prioritized zoonotic diseases and enhancements of laboratory testing and joint outbreak response capacities in the human and animal health sectors will create and strengthen the mechanisms necessary to effectively detect and respond to <b>emerging</b> <b>health</b> <b>threats,</b> and thereby enhance global health security. 29155661 PMC 571131...|$|E
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} virus (HPAI) strain H 5 N 1 has had {{direct and indirect}} economic impacts arising from direct mortality and control programmes in over 50 countries reporting poultry outbreaks. HPAI H 5 N 1 is now reported as the most widespread and expensive zoonotic disease recorded and continues to pose a global <b>health</b> <b>threat.</b> The aim {{of this research was}} to assess the potential of utilising Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points (HACCP) assessments in providing a framework for a rapid response to emerging infectious disease outbreaks. This novel approach applies a scientific process, widely used in food production systems, to assess risks related to a specific <b>emerging</b> <b>health</b> <b>threat</b> within a known zoonotic disease hotspot. We conducted a HACCP assessment for HPAI viruses within Vietnam’s domestic poultry trade and relate our findings to the existing literature. Our HACCP assessment identified poultry flock isolation, transportation, slaughter, preparation and consumption as critical control points for Vietnam’s domestic poultry trade. Introduction of the preventative measures highlighted through this HACCP evaluation would reduce the risks posed by HPAI viruses and pressure on the national economy.

40|$|Arenaviruses {{present an}} <b>emerging</b> <b>health</b> <b>threat</b> in agrarian areas of Africa and South America; however, the natural routes of arenaviral infections are not clearly understood. Our {{previous}} studies with {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus}} (LCMV), the prototype arenavirus, implicate oral and intragastric routes as natural routes of infection. Our studies raised many questions about the primary site of infection and the route of dissemination after gastric infection. In this report, we use in situ hybridization to detect LCMV in various organs at different time points (0 to 96 hours). After gastric inoculation, the gastric mucosa is the initial site of viral infection, followed by infection of the spleen and liver, then ileum and last, lung, kidney, brain, and esophagus. Furthermore, our observations suggest that virus is disseminated lymphatically rather than by a hematogenous route. Infectious center assays using mononuclear cells from stomach, blood, and spleen of mice infected by the gastric route confirmed active infection with LCMV {{and the presence of}} mononuclear cells producing infectious virus in these tissues.

40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the total and speciated Arsenic (As) concentrations and other drinking water quality parameters for unraveling the health risk of As from drinking water to humans. Groundwater samples (n = 62) were collected from three previously unexplored rural areas (Chichawatni, Vehari, Rahim Yar Khan) of Punjab, Pakistan. The As concentration in the groundwater samples ranged from < 10 – 206 μg/L which was higher than the WHO safe limit of 10 μg/L. Arsenite (As(III)) constituted 13 – 67 % of total As and arsenate (As(V)) ranged from 33 – 100 % in the study area. For As health risk assessment, the hazard quotient (11 – 18 times) and cancer risk (46 – 600 times) values were found more than US-EPA recommended values. Various other water quality parameters also enhanced the health risk.
