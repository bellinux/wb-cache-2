25|$|In {{a session}} in {{parliament}} {{on the issue}} of Hirsi Ali's citizenship, Verdonk said that she {{had no choice but to}} revoke her passport, as it had been issued under a false name and <b>false</b> <b>date</b> of birth. Some members of parliament suggested that Verdonk's stern actions were a result of her political ambitions in the 2006 VVD leadership elections. The result of the debate was that Verdonk promised to have another look at the case and see if it was possible for Hirsi Ali keep her citizenship.|$|E
25|$|On June 27, 2006 Verdonk {{informed}} parliament of {{her decision}} to allow MP Ayaan Hirsi Ali to keep her Dutch passport. According to Verdonk, Hirsi Ali had presented her with new convincing evidence related to her use of her grandfather's surname, and the <b>false</b> <b>date</b> of birth was insufficient grounds to cancel her passport. The next day, during a parliamentary debate took place, minister Verdonk and prime-minister Jan Peter Balkenende were questioned about the decision. At {{the end of the}} first period of the debate, the prime minister said that Hirsi Ali had to sign a letter accepting responsibility for her false statements in order to retain her citizenship. Otherwise, the solution would not be acceptable for minister Verdonk.|$|E

25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I Martin enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 12 April 1915, against the wishes of his family. His parents finally agreed however when {{he made it clear}} that he would sign on under an assumed name and never write to them if they did not consent. He gave a <b>false</b> <b>date</b> of birth to the recruiting officer, claiming to be 18, when he was actually 14 years and three months. His father had earlier tried to enlist but had been rejected as being too old. Martin joined the 1st Reinforcements of the 21st Battalion as a private and trained in Broadmeadows and Seymour (later Puckapunyal) camps in Victoria before boarding HMAT Berrima in June 1915 to deploy to Egypt, arriving there in late July.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1523, when Christian II of Denmark {{came to the}} Netherlands, he asked Gossaert to paint the likenesses of his dwarfs. In 1528 he {{requested}} the artist to furnish to Jean de Hare the design for his queen Isabellas tomb in the abbey of St Pierre near Ghent. It was no doubt {{at this time that}} Gossaert completed the portraits of John, Dorothy and Christine, children of Christian II, which came into the collection of Henry VIII. No doubt, also, these portraits are identical with those of three children at Hampton Court, which were long known and often copied as likenesses of Prince Arthur, Prince Henry and Princess Margaret of England. One of the copies at Wilton, inscribed with the forged name of Hans Holbein, ye father, and the <b>false</b> <b>date</b> of 1495, has often been cited as a proof that Gossaert came to England in the reign of Henry VII; but the statement rests on no foundation whatever.|$|E

James Callaghan senior had {{run away from home}} in the 1890s to join the Royal Navy, as he was a year too young to enlist, he gave a <b>false</b> <b>date</b> of birth and changed his surname from Garogher to Callaghan, so that his true identity could not be traced, he rose to the rank of Chief Petty Officer.

The competing patentee discovered the truth, but procured rights to the patent by private settlement, complicit in the scheme, and then sought to enforce the patent against others. In a later enforcement action, a trial court learned of the facts and ruled against the patentee based on the patentee having unclean hands, but the Seventh Circuit appellate court reversed, and on further appeal, the Supreme Court reversed, reinstating the trial court's decision.|$|R

He would know that Scott did not interpolate a single stanza; that spelling, punctuation, and some slight verbal corrections, with an admirable emendation, were the sum of his industry: that he did not even excise two stanzas of, at earliest, eighteenth century work.|$|E

5000|$|One {{issue in}} using stratigraphic {{relationships}} {{is that the}} date of artifacts in a context does not represent {{the date of the}} context, but just the earliest date the context could be.

These artifacts are referred to as [...] "residual" [...] or [...] "residual finds". It is crucial that dating a context is based on the latest dating evidence drawn from the context. We can also see that if the fill of cut 5 - the wall 2, backfill 3 and trample 12 — are not removed entirely during excavation because of [...] "undercutting", non-residual artifacts from these later [...] "higher" [...] contexts 2, 3 and 12 could contaminate the excavation of earlier contexts such as 9 and 10 and give <b>false</b> <b>dating</b> information.
