40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the potential use of colonoscopy and endoluminal ultrasonic biomicroscopy (eUBM) {{to track the}} progression of mouse colonic lesions. METHODS: Ten mice were treated with a single azoxymethane intraperitoneal injection (week 1) followed by seven days of a dextran sulfate sodium treatment in their drinking water (week 2) to induce inflammation-associated colon tumors. eUBM was performed simultaneously with colonoscopy at weeks 13, 17 - 20 and 21. A 3. 6 -F diameter 40 MHz mini-probe catheter was used for eUBM imaging. The ultrasound mini-probe catheter was inserted into the accessory channel of a pediatric flexible bronchofiberscope, allowing simultaneous acquisition of colonoscopic and eUBM images. During image acquisition, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and kept in a supine position over a stainless steel heated surgical waterbed at 37 &#x 2005; 0;C. Both eUBM and colonoscopic images were captured and stored when a lesion was detected by colonoscopy or when the eUBM image revealed a modified colon wall anatomy. During the procedure, the colon was irrigated with water that was injected through a <b>flush</b> <b>port</b> on the mini-probe catheter and that acted as the ultrasound coupling medium between the transducer and the colon wall. Once the acquisition of the last eUBM/colonoscopy section for each animal was completed, the colons were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Colon images acquired at the first time-point for each mouse were compared with subsequent eUBM/colonoscopic images of the same sites obtained in the following acquisitions to evaluate lesion progression. RESULTS: All 10 mice had eUBM and colonoscopic images acquired at week 13 (the first time-point). Two animals died immediately after the first imaging acquisition and, consequently, only 8 mice were subjected to the second eUBM/colonoscopy imaging acquisition (at the second time-point). Due to the advanced stage of colonic tumorigenesis, 5 animals died after the second time-point image acquisition, and thus, only three were subjected to the third eUBM/colonoscopy imaging acquisition (the third time-point). eUBM was able to detect the four layers in healthy segments of colon: the mucosa (the first hyperechoic layer {{moving away from the}} mini-probe axis), followed by the muscularis mucosae (hypoechoic), the submucosa (the second hyperechoic layer) and the muscularis externa (the second hypoechoic layer). Hypoechoic regions between the mucosa and the muscularis externa layers represented lymphoid infiltrates, as confirmed by the corresponding histological images. Pedunculated tumors were represented by hyperechoic masses in the mucosa layer. Among the lesions that decreased in size between the first and third time-points, one of the lesions changed from a mucosal hyperplasia with ulceration at the top to a mucosal hyperplasia with lymphoid infiltrate and, finally, to small signs of mucosal hyperplasia and lymphoid infiltrate. In this case, while lesion regression and modification were observable in the eUBM images, colonoscopy was only able to detect the lesion at the first and second time-points, without the capacity to demonstrate the presence of lymphoid infiltrate. Regarding the lesions that increased in size, one of them started as a small elevation in the mucosa layer and progressed to a pedunculated tumor. In this case, while eUBM imaging revealed the lesion at the first time-point, colonoscopy was only able to detect it at the second time-point. All colonic lesions (tumors, lymphoid infiltrate and mucosal thickening) were identified by eUBM, while colonoscopy identified just 76 % of them. Colonoscopy identified all of the colonic tumors but failed to diagnose lymphoid infiltrates and increased mucosal thickness and failed to differentiate lymphoid infiltrates from small adenomas. During the observation period, most of the lesions (approximately 67 %) increased in size, approximately 14 % remained unchanged, and 19 % regressed. CONCLUSION: Combining eUBM with colonoscopy improves the diagnosis and the follow-up of mouse colonic lesions, adding transmural assessment of the bowel wall...|$|E

40|$|A {{computational}} {{technique has}} been developed to obtain final air data quantities for a sharp-nosed hypersonic vehicle. Pressure measurements from five <b>flush</b> pressure <b>ports</b> are the only input needed. Four of the ports are installed around the forebody circumference and the fifth is on the nose. The pressure model is based on Lees-modified Newtonian method and corrected by pressure data from computational fluid dynamics analysis. Although this approach {{is similar to that}} used for the blunt-nosed space shuttle, it is designed specifically for a sharp-nosed aircraft. The potential of this method has been demonstrated, especially in obtaining values for dynamic pressure and angle of attack...|$|R

Autonomous thermal soar-ing has already been validated in flight tests with small UAVs, but this level of demonstra-tion has not been performed for dynamic soaring UAVs, partly due to the precise wind measurements required. This paper explores wind vector sensing using <b>flush</b> pressure <b>ports</b> located on the nose of small sailplanes. Single Hidden Layer neural networks are used to generate regression models to calculate the airspeed, angle of attack, and angle of sideslip and are trained with pressure measurements collected during wind tunnel tests.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a design study for a pressure based Flush airdata system (FADS) on the Hypersonic Air Launched Option (HALO) Vehicle. The analysis will demonstrate {{the feasibility of}} using a pressure based airdata system for the HALO and provide measurement uncertainty estimates along a candidate trajectory. The HALO is a conceived as a man-rated vehicle to be air launched from an SR- 71 platform and is proposed as a testbed for an airbreathing hydrogen scramjet. A feasibility study has been performed and indicates that the proposed trajectory is possible with minimal modifications to the existing SR 71 vehicle. The mission consists of launching the HALO {{off the top of}} an SR- 71 at Mach 3 and 80, 000 ft. A rocket motor is then used to accelerate the vehicle to the test condition. After the scramjet test is completed the vehicle will glide to a lakebed runway landing. This option provides reusability of the vehicle and scramjet engine. The HALO design will also allow for various scramjet engine and flowpath designs to be flight tested. For the HALO flights, measurements of freestream airdata are considered to be a mission critical to perform gain scheduling and trajectory optimization. One approach taken to obtaining airdata involves measurement of certain parameters such as external atmospheric winds, temperature, etc to estimate the airdata quantities. This study takes an alternate approach. Here the feasibility of obtaining airdata using a pressure-based flush airdata system (FADS) methods is assessed. The analysis, although it is performed using the HALO configuration and trajectory, is generally applicable to other hypersonic vehicles. The method to be presented offers the distinct advantage of inferring total pressure, Mach number, and flow incidence angles, without stagnating the freestream flow. This approach allows for airdata measurements to be made using blunt surfaces and significantly diminishes the heating load at the sensor. In the FADS concept a matrix of <b>flush</b> <b>ports</b> is placed {{in the vicinity of the}} aircraft nose, and the airdata are inferred indirectly from the measured pressures...|$|R
30|$|Both the afferent and efferent {{ports of}} the CVC, {{connected}} to the dialysate chamber, were labeled with tags mentioning not to <b>flush</b> these <b>ports.</b> Unfortunately, unsupervised nurses thought there was backflow {{of blood in the}} afferent port because of the deep-red/purple color and flushed it with normal saline immediately. This resulted in a rupture of the delicate semipermeable membrane and thus malfunctioning of the CVC: Saline pumped into the chamber disappeared into the circulation, and the efferent port stopped producing dialysate. After this we continued using the special CVC as a normal CVC, with two stops at the extra ports. The manufacturer changed the color of the lumen and its connector to prevent this incident after this study. These problems, however, did raise some concerns. However, {{we do not believe that}} these problems were caused by an insufficient introduction of the study device in the unit since we organized multiple training sessions for nurses and instructed nurses individually when a patient was included in the study and monitored by the device.|$|R
40|$|AbstractHeparin-induced {{thrombocytopenia}} (HIT) is {{a potentially}} serious complication of heparin therapy {{and is being}} encountered more frequently in patients with cardiovascular disease as use of anticoagulant therapy becomes more widespread. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of this immune-mediated condition has improved in recent years, with heparin–platelet factor 4 complex as the culprit antigen in most patients. New sensitive laboratory assays for the pathogenic antibody are now available and should permit an earlier, more reliable diagnosis, but their optimal application remains to be defined. For patients in whom HIT is diagnosed, immediate discontinuation of heparin infusions and elimination of heparin from all <b>flushes</b> and <b>ports</b> are mandatory. Further management of patients with HIT is problematic at present, as there are no readily available alternative anticoagulant agents in the United States with proven efficacy in acute coronary disease. The direct thrombin inhibitors {{appear to be the}} most promising alternatives to heparin, when continued use of heparin is contraindicated, and the results of several multicenter trials evaluating their application in patients with HIT are awaited...|$|R
30|$|Factors {{that lead}} to {{thrombus}} formation and subsequent CRT involve a complex series of events beginning with the deposition {{of a variety of}} blood proteins and tissue factors that together facilitate platelet adhesion to a surface [12, 13]. Platelets then activate and expedite the coagulation cascade, frequently leading to fibrin sheath formation along the device within 24  h [14]. Routine anticoagulation prophylaxis, blood-thinning therapy, and <b>flushing</b> of catheter <b>ports,</b> typically with heparin, are the only methods currently used to prevent CRT. Unfortunately, these treatments have not demonstrated efficacy against morbidity and mortality [14, 15] and can lead to thrombocytopenia, where low platelet counts in the blood can cause hemorrhaging or an increased risk of CRT [16, 17].|$|R
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{investigation}} {{was performed in}} the 14 - by 22 -Foot Subsonic Tunnel on a pressure instrumented 1 / 8 -scale twin-engine subsonic transport {{to better understand the}} flow physics on a multi-element wing section. The wing consisted of a part-span, triple-slotted trailing edge flap, inboard leading-edge Krueger flap and an outboard leading-edge slat. The model was instrumented with <b>flush</b> pressure <b>ports</b> at the fuselage centerline and seven spanwise wing locations. The model was tested in cruise, take-off and landing configurations at dynamic pressures and Mach numbers from 10 lbf/ft(exp 2) to 50 lbf/ft(exp 2) and 0. 08 to 0. 17, respectively. This resulted in corresponding Reynolds numbers of 0. 8 x 10 (exp 5) to 1. 8 x 10 (exp 6). Pressure data were collected using electronically scanned pressure devices and force and moment data were collected with a six component strain gauge balance. Results are presented for various control surface deflections over an angle-of-attack range from - 4 degrees to 16 degrees and sideslip angle range from - 10 degrees to 10 degrees. Longitudinal and lateral directional aerodynamic data are presented as well as chordwise pressure distributions at the seven spanwise wing locations and the fuselage centerline...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{addition of}} toluene as a solute of treated ballast water from oil tankers into a well-defined estuary facilitated {{the study of}} the dynamics of dissolved hydrocarbon metabolism in seawater. Most rates of toluene oxidation were in the range of 1 to 30 pg/liter per h at 0. 5 μg of toluene per liter. Near the ballast water injection point, a layer of warm ballast water, rich in bacteria, that was trapped below the less-dense fresh surface water was located. Toluene residence times were approximately 2 weeks in this layer, 2 years elsewhere in Port Valdez, and 2 decades in the surface water of a more oceanic receiving estuary adjacent. Mixing was adequate for a steady-state treatment which showed that 98 % of the toluene was <b>flushed</b> from <b>Port</b> Valdez before metabolism and gave a steady-state concentration of 0. 18 μg/liter. Total bacterial biomass from direct counts and organism size data was usually near 0. 1 mg/liter, but ranged up to 0. 8 mg/liter in the bacteria-rich layer. The origin of bacteria in this layer was traced to growth in oil tanker ballast during shipments. The biomass of toluene oxidizers in water samples was estimated from the average affinity of pure-culture isolates for toluene (28 liters per g of cells per h) and observed toluene oxidation kinetics. Values ranged from nearly all of the total bacterial biomass within the bacteria-rich layer down to 0. 2 % at points far removed. Because the population of toluene oxidizers was large with respect to the amount of toluene consumed and because water from a nearby nonpolluted estuary was equally active in facilitating toluene metabolism, we searched for an additional hydrocarbon source. It was found that terpenes could be washed from spruce trees by simulated rainfall, which suggested that riparian conifers provide an additional and significant hydrocarbon source to seawater...|$|R
