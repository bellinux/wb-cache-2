As her disease advances, she becomes unable to give focused lectures and loses her job. She becomes lost searching <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> in her own home and does not recognize Lydia after seeing her perform in a play.|$|E

2500|$|The San Fernando Building was {{the first}} of the three {{buildings}} to reopen in August 2000, and by March 2001, the building was 93% leased to tenants paying rents between $790 and $6,000 per month. The converted buildings consisted of large, open lofts with high ceilings and no interior walls except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms.</b> <b>The</b> conversion was designed by architect Wade Killefer, who noted, [...] "What lends these buildings to residential use is lots of windows and high ceilings, offering wonderful light."

The central hot water system, a feature which {{only a handful of}} buildings in Berlin in the late 1860s possessed, was an indication of the building's modernity. Examples of the luxurious, but classically inspired interior decoration {{can be seen in the}} designs <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> where Roman Pompeii style wall paintings graced the walls (right). The more senior domestic staff – the nanny and governess – were also housed on the upper floor.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} {{in people}} with DLB most commonly involve perception of people or animals that are not there, and may reflect Lewy bodies or AD pathology in the temporal lobe. Delusions may include reduplicative paramnesia and other elaborate misperceptions or misinterpretations. These hallucinations are not necessarily disturbing, and in some cases, the person with DLB may have insight into the hallucinations and even be amused by them, or be conscious they are not real. People with DLB also may have problems with vision, including double vision, and misinterpretation of what they see, for example, mistaking a pile of socks for snakes or a clothes closet <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom.</b>|$|E

[...] The house is eventually rented to actors Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd, and Peter invites the two actors to his house for dinner. Peter shows them some of his comedy bits, including a crude impersonation of John Wayne, which Chase, Aykroyd and Lois find painfully unfunny.|$|E

The Hellman Building, now known as Banco Popular, is an eight-story brick and concrete structure designed by Alfred Rosenheim.

500|$|A {{significant}} petition was circulated by Jonathan Speelman {{and others}} regarding the mandatory notification of the arbiter when leaving the playing area (the petition concentrated on toilet visits). Reasons given for this protesting against this [...] "noxious" [...] rule included: the FIDE rule that the toilet {{is part of}} the playing area; an indication it was [...] "humiliating" [...] for players to discuss bodily functions with arbiters (and embarrassing for the arbiters); a note that the Match Arbiter (the indicated person to be notified) was not always available, rendering it difficult to always comply with the rule; an argument that frequent toilet trips did not indicate cheating, and a request that players not be penalised merely for this; and an argument that the opponent might gain information from seeing a player notify the arbiter by moving as soon as they left <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> visit. The response by Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov noted only that the third complaint was legitimate, and that [...] "common sense" [...] should apply.|$|E
500|$|At {{his high}} school reunion, Peter pretends to be a secret agent-astronaut-millionaire who wears a cowboy hat to impress his classmates, but the truth comes out when he meets Tom Brady. He {{subsequently}} gets drunk and {{has to make a}} run <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> knocking over everyone between him and the bathroom. Brady is impressed and gets Peter a spot on the New England Patriots football team as the starting center. Peter is soon fired for showboating in a game versus the Dallas Cowboys, driving on to the field then performing a massively-choreographed version of the song [...] "Shipoopi" [...] after scoring one touchdown. He is traded to the London Silly Nannies, who apparently have no clue on how to play football. Peter decides to turn them around and challenges Brady to a game between the Silly Nannies and the Patriots. On the opening kickoff, Peter's teammates become terrified of the Patriots rushing toward them and run away, leaving Peter to face them alone. He tries and is immediately tackled. However, Brady compliments Peter on having the nerve to stand up to them.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} days, while at {{work with the}} other firemen ransacking the book-filled house of an old woman before the inevitable burning, Montag steals a book before any of his coworkers notice. The woman refuses to leave her house and her books, choosing instead to light a match and burn herself alive. Montag returns home jarred by the woman's suicide. While getting ready for bed, he hides the stolen book under his pillow. Still shaken by the night's events, he attempts to make conversation with Mildred, starting by asking her {{when they first met}} and where. Mildred goes to answer, but immediately forgets. As she laughs off her ignorance and heads <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> to take more sleeping pills, Montag realizes just how much Mildred's sleeping pill addiction, love of interactive entertainment, and fast driving has ruined her mind and their marriage. Later, as Mildred is sleeping, Montag wakes her up and asks her if she has seen or heard anything about Clarisse McClellan. Mildred initially brushes off the question until she finally reveals what happened: Clarisse's family moved away after Clarisse got hit by a speeding car and died four days ago. Dismayed by her failure to mention this earlier, Montag uneasily tries to fall asleep. Outside he suspects the presence of [...] "The Hound", an eight-legged robotic dog-like creature that resides in the firehouse and aids the firemen.|$|E

60|$|Comus {{could no}} more have devised such a letter than he could have written an Episcopal charge to the clergy of any given diocese. It was {{obviously}} the work of Courtenay Youghal, and Comus, for a palpable purpose of his own, had wheedled him into foregoing for once the pride of authorship in a clever piece of political raillery, and letting his young friend stand sponsor instead. It was a daring stroke, {{and there could be}} no question as to its success; the secretaryship and the distant shark-girt island faded away into the horizon of impossible things. Francesca, forgetting the golden rule of strategy which enjoins a careful choosing of ground and opportunity before entering on hostilities, made straight <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> door, behind which a lively din of splashing betokened that Comus had at least begun his toilet.|$|E
