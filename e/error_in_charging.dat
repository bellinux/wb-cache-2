Materials and Methods: This article examines the experimental simulation method of Gamma-rays'- absorbed dose in &micro;Sv in the eye cornea, thyroid and testicles measured {{with the use of}} a RANDO phantom and the employment of TLD 100 H (Li:Mg:P:Cu) dosimeters and a model 4500 reader, made by Harshaw, an American manufacture. The simulation method was performed on pre-determined parts in both normal and emergency conditions. Results and Conclusion: The result of this research indicates that the level of absorbed dose in various body parts of radiation workers in ordinary work conditions in controlled areas is less than the allowable absorbed dose. Moreover, despite the fact that the irradiation level for the whole body and different body parts are being 10 times more in restricted and prohibited areas, the absorbed dose is also measured to be less than the allowable dose. However, number of incidences such as human <b>error</b> <b>in</b> <b>charging</b> the gamma cameras in Industrial radio isotope department can cause the whole body irradiation of a radiation worker to exceed the allowable dose of 20 msv per year...|$|E

Quality control is largely {{a concern for the}} analytical laboratory, but the geochemist or reservoir engineer using the chemical data must also be concerned with analytical quality. To test accuracy and reliability of analyses available from laboratories, splits of seven water samples were sent to four stable-isotope laboratories, and splits of five water samples were sent to four chemical laboratories. The analyses of each sample were compared among laboratories, and the differences in analyses were evaluated using criteria developed for this comparison. Isotopic compositions were considered reliable if they deviated from mean values by less than 2 {per_thousand}, for hydrogen and by less than 0. 15 {per_thousand}, for oxygen. Concentrations of each chemical component were considered reliable if they differed from mean values by less than 10 %. Chemical analyses were examined for internal consistency by calculating the <b>error</b> <b>in</b> ionic <b>charge</b> balance and the error between ionic charge and electrical conductivity. To be considered internally consistent, chemical analyses must have less than 5 % <b>error</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> balance and less than 10 % <b>error</b> <b>in</b> conductivity balance.

For 10 of the patients, additional plans were prepared with individually selected beam setups, aiming at avoiding severe tissue heterogeneities.

Electronic components produce heat that hinders their performance and reliability. Heat pipes, two-phase heat transfer devices, may be used to effectively cool electronic components. This project focuses on two different heat pipe designs that may potentially be used to cool electronic components. One heat pipe design being studied uses metal wires to form its wicking structure. This simple wick design may result in reduced manufacturing costs. The second heat pipe design has a wick pattern formed in a copper plate. The wick pattern is designed to separate the flow of vapor and liquid within the heat pipe. To evaluate both heat pipe designs, test articles were fabricated and tested to determine their heat transfer performance.

40|$|Approximate density {{functional}} theory (DFT) {{suffers from}} many-electron self- interaction error, {{otherwise known as}} delocalization error, that may be diagnosed and then corrected through elimination of the deviation from exact piecewise linear behavior between integer electron numbers. Although paths to correction of energetic delocalization error are well- established, {{the impact of these}} corrections on the electron density is less well-studied. Here, we compare the effect on density delocalization of DFT+U, global hybrid tuning, and range- separated hybrid tuning on a diverse test set of 32 transition metal complexes and observe the three methods to have qualitatively equivalent effects on the ground state density. Regardless of valence orbital diffuseness (i. e., from 2 p to 5 p), ligand electronegativity (i. e., from Al to O), basis set (i. e., plane wave versus localized basis set), metal (i. e., Ti, Fe, Ni) and spin state, or tuning method, we consistently observe substantial charge loss at the metal and gain at ligand atoms (ca. 0. 3 - 0. 5 e or more). This charge loss at the metal is preferentially from the minority spin, leading to increasing magnetic moment as well. Using accurate wavefunction theory references, we observe that a minimum <b>error</b> <b>in</b> partial <b>charges</b> and magnetic moments occur at higher tuning parameters than typically employed to eliminate energetic delocalization error. These observations motivate the need to develop multi-faceted approximate-DFT error correction approaches that separately treat density delocalization and energetic <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> order to recover both correct density and magnetization properties.

5000|$|The normal {{functioning}} of a CCD, astronomical or otherwise, {{can be divided}} into two phases: exposure and readout. During the first phase, the CCD passively collects incoming photons, storing electrons in its cells. After the exposure time is passed, the cells are read out one line at a time. During the readout phase, cells are shifted down the entire area of the CCD. While they are shifted, they continue to collect light. Thus, if the shifting is not fast enough, errors can result from light that falls on a cell holding charge during the transfer. These errors are referred to as [...] "vertical smear" [...] and cause a strong light source to create a vertical line above and below its exact location. In addition, the CCD cannot be used to collect light while it is being read out. Unfortunately, a faster shifting requires a faster readout, and a faster readout can introduce <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> the cell <b>charge</b> measurement, leading to a higher noise level.|$|R
40|$|Calibration {{of extreme}} {{ultraviolet}} (EUV) instruments utilized in space missions {{is essential in}} order to determine detector properties and optimize their design. Under the supervision of Professor Yoshikawa, this study has looked into Resistive Anode Encoders (RAE). Part of the thesis study the RAE readout mechanism and the role of RAE shape, readout technique, electrode position, sheet resistivity and intrinsic capacitance and its effect on detector positional resolution and image distortion. The goal of the study is to increase knowledge of Micro channel plate (MCP) and RAE based detectors {{so that it can be}} applied in primarily the development of the PHEBUS and EXCEED detectors and also in future EUV detectors developed at the University of Tokyo. A general conclusion that RAE of Professor C. W Gear's circular arced terminated design utilizing charge ratio as readout technique is favourable from both resolution and distortion perspectives is made. In order to determine the distortion the RAE and MCP assemblies has been irradiated by a deuterium source through a fixed grating. The Gear anode is found to have an ideally linear position response over the majority of the anode area and shows small signs of positive radial distortion, known as barrel distortion. When designed as a rectangle the effective area of the detector diminishes and the barrel distortion increases. The report also includes a study on determination of correct pulse shape amplifier time constants for optimized operational resolution. A conclusion is drawn, that RAE resistivity and intrinsic capacitance governs the charge diffusion speed through the anode resistive layer and the correct choice of shaper time constant to match the charge diffusion speed, as well as frequency of incoming particles are the key elements in a high resolution distortion free RAE based detector. The study includes a series of experiments on RAE charge diffusion and charge injection techniques. The reason for previously unknown RAE charge leakage is explained and has through experiments with probe injected charge been identified to be an <b>error</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> injection technique rather than an <b>error</b> <b>in</b> the anode itself. Theory on correct probe injection is presented stating that injection of charge should be done with a probe with minimized probe tip area. This result shows that injection of charge through a probe tip is not suitable for resistive anode surfaces due to their mechanically brittle nature. Further research into electron gun injection of charge is suggested as an alternative. Measurements of overall detector capacitance have been made utilizing a number of electronic circuits. A Schering bridge is proved to be partially successful and a AVR based timing circuit is shown to be superior in measurement accuracy. The capacitances between the different MCP stages and towards ground is found to be in the range of 30 pF - 150 pF which fit previous calculations made by Dr. Kazuo Yoshioka.

40|$|Non-intrusive load {{monitoring}} (NILM) is {{an important}} topic in smart-grid and smart-home. Many energy disaggregation algorithms have been proposed to detect various individual appliances from one aggregated signal observation. However, few works studied the energy disaggregation of plug-in electric vehicle (EV) <b>charging</b> <b>in</b> the residential environment since EVs charging at home has emerged only recently. Recent studies showed that EV charging has a large impact on smart-grid especially in summer. Therefore, EV charging monitoring has become a more important and urgent missing piece in energy disaggregation. In this paper, we present a novel method to disaggregate EV charging signals from aggregated real power signals. The proposed method can effectively mitigate interference coming from air-conditioner (AC), enabling accurate EV charging detection and energy estimation under the presence of AC power signals. Besides, the proposed algorithm requires no training, demands a light computational load, delivers high estimation accuracy, and works well for data recorded at the low sampling rate 1 / 60 Hz.
