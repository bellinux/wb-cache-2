Many fans of the model claim that there is no mobile phone which can replace the SL45i (either the original one, or SL42/45 enhanced with SL45i firmware) for them.|$|E

40|$|The Ground Processing Scheduling System (GPSS) {{computer}} program {{is used to}} develop streamlined schedules for the inspection, repair, and refurbishment of space shuttles at Kennedy Space Center. A scheduling {{computer program}} is needed because space-shuttle processing is complex and it is frequently necessary to modify schedules to accommodate unanticipated events, unavailability of specialized personnel, unexpected delays, {{and the need to}} repair newly discovered defects. GPSS implements constraint-based scheduling algorithms and provides an interactive scheduling software environment. In response to inputs, GPSS can respond with schedules that are optimized {{in the sense that they}} contain minimal violations of constraints while supporting the most effective and efficient utilization of space-shuttle ground processing resources. The present version of GPSS is a product of re-engineering of a prototype version. While the prototype version proved to be valuable and versatile as a scheduling software tool during the first five years, it was characterized by design and algorithmic deficiencies that affected schedule revisions, query capability, task movement, report capability, and overall interface complexity. In addition, the lack of documentation gave rise to difficulties in maintenance and limited both <b>enhanceability</b> and portability. The goal of the GPSS re-engineering project was to upgrade the prototype into a flexible system that supports multiple- flow, multiple-site scheduling and that retains the strengths of the prototype while incorporating improvements in maintainability, <b>enhanceability,</b> and portability...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{area network}} {{contains}} significant redundancy and can sustain considerable damage, or cope with substantial movement, {{because of the}} alternative routes available. In this paper we examine some mea-sure of effectiveness (MOE) factors for Army Terrestrial Communications System (TCS) in detail: mobility, security/survivability, system availability, grade of service (GOS), design flexibility, interoperability, relia-bility, maintainability, cost effectiveness, and <b>enhanceability.</b> We also shall analyze the average link delay versus network size and arrival rate which is related to GOS factors. We believe that the flood search routing algorithm provides survivability and is a viable option for providing a reliable routing framework in Arm...|$|E
40|$|Preparations of catechols from {{ethyl acetate}} {{extracts}} of cultures of Klebsiellae in a low-iron medium contained iron-chelators whose potency {{was measured by}} the reversal of the bacteristasis of Escherichia coli and klebsiellae in unheated horse serum, and of the growth-inhibition of these two organisms by ethylene diamine di-orthohydroxyphenyl acetic acid (EDDA). As revealed by in situ tests of paper chromatograms, there was a multiplicity of biologically active chelators in the preparations. Catechols from strains both of high and low virulence for guinea-pigs enhanced the skin infectivity of most of the 10 Klebsiella strains tested. The enhancement was roughly proportional to iron-enhanceability with the 6 iron-enhanceable (E+) strains, though not as great as that by iron. But of the 4 (Eo) strains not enhanceable by iron, two were moderately enhanced by the catechols. The Streptomyces iron-chelator desferrioxamine B also enhanced infectivity, again roughly in proportion to the iron <b>enhanceability</b> of the strains; though one Eo strain was substantially enhanced. The synthetic iron-chelator EDDA did not enhance infection...|$|E

40|$|Spendlove, R. S. (California State Department of Public Health, Berkeley), and F. L. Schaffer. Enzymatic {{enhancement}} of infectivity of reovirus. J. Bacteriol. 89 : 597 – 602. 1965. —Enhancement of infectivity by chymotrypsin treatment {{has been demonstrated}} with all three types of reovirus, although not in all viral preparations. Enzyme treatment did not produce a simultaneous increase in the hemagglutinating activity of reovirus type 1 (the only type tested). The infectivity of reovirus type 1 (Lang strain) was increased by treatment with chymotrypsin, trypsin, papain, and a filtrate from a culture of a Pseudomonas sp. but not by treatment with pepsin. Sedimentation experiments showed that the property of <b>enhanceability</b> was {{closely associated with the}} virus particles themselves. Results of studies involving various sequential treatments with chymotrypsin, and with heat in {{the presence or absence of}} 2 m MgCl 2, were compatible with the interpretation that inhibited virus is resistant to exposure to a temperature of 56 C in the absence of MgCl 2, whereas activated virus is thermolabile. Activation of reovirus infectivity by heat in the presence of MgCl 2 and by chymotrypsin was not additive...|$|E
40|$|The {{infectivity}} of 16 {{strains of}} Klebsiella spp. and its modification by systemic and local ferric iron {{were tested in}} {{the skin of the}} guinea-pig. The in vivo proliferation of 11 strains was enhanced in varying degrees by Fe+++ (E + strains); 5 strains (Eo) were not enhanceable even by large doses of Fe+++. Of 10 strains examined in detail, 6 were E + and 4 were E 0. Guinea-pig and human sera were consistently bacteriostatic for E + strains and bactericidal for Eo strains. Both Fe+++ and microbial iron-chelators abolished the bacteriostasis of E + strains but did not affect the lethal effect on Eo strains. Both effects were diminished by heating the sera to 56 degrees for 30 min and by the anticomplementary substance Liquoid; neither appeared to be due to specific antibody. Virulence, as measured in the skin and by intravenous injection, was roughly associated with degree of <b>enhanceability</b> by iron, the EO strains being among the least virulent. The volume of plasma exudate entering the skin during the first 5 h was sufficient to kill {{a large proportion of the}} infecting doses of Eo strains and to inhibit the growth of infecting doses of E + strains. Enhancement of the latter by Fe+++ is predominantly the result of inhibition of the non-specific bacteriostasis exerted by the extravascular plasma. Lesions by E + strains aged 4 h or more are insusceptible to systemic Fe+++ and only moderately susceptible to large doses of local Fe+++. The insusceptibility appears to be due to segregation of the infecting bacilli within exudate leucocytes. Klebsiella infections accordingly provide another example of an initial decisive period of action of the antibacterial defences-in this case non-specific and humoral-which cease to be locally effective after the first few hours. Besides enhancing lesions due to E + strains, systemic Fe+++ has an opposite, apparently anti-inflammatory action on klebsiella lesions, slightly decreasing their size. It was evident with all the strains tested, whether dead or alive, but not in E + lesions in circumstances when they were susceptible to enhancement by the Fe+++...|$|E
