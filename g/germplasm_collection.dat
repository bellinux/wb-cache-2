2500|$|Cryoconservation {{of animal}} genetic {{resources}} is a strategy wherein samples of animal genetic materials are preserved cryogenically. Animal genetic resources, {{as defined by the}} Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, are [...] "those animal species that are used, or may be used, for the production of food and agriculture, and the populations within each of them. These populations within each species can be classified as wild and feral populations, landraces and primary populations, standardised breeds, selected lines, varieties, strains and any conserved genetic material; all of which are currently categorized as Breeds." [...] Genetic materials that are typically cryogenically preserved include sperm, oocytes, embryos and somatic cells. Cryogenic facilities are called gene banks and can vary greatly in size usually according to the economic resources available. They must be able to facilitate <b>germplasm</b> <b>collection,</b> processing, freezing, and long term storage, all in a hygienic and organized manner. Gene banks must maintain a precise database and make information and genetic resources accessible to properly facilitate cryoconservation. Cryoconservation is an ex situ conservation strategy that often coexists alongside in situ conservation to protect and preserve livestock genetics. Cryoconservation of livestock genetic resources is primarily done in order to preserve the genetics of populations of interest, such as indigenous breeds, also known as local or minor breeds. Material may be stored because individuals shared specific genes and phenotypes that may be of value or have potential value for researchers or breeders. Therefore, one of the main goals remains preserving the gene pool of local breeds that may be threatened. Indigenous livestock genetics are commonly threatened by factors such as globalization, modernization, changes in production systems, inappropriate introduction of major breeds, genetic drift, inbreeding, crossbreeding, climate change, natural disasters, disease, cultural changes, and urbanization. Indigenous livestock are critical to sustainable agricultural development and food security, due to their: adaptation to environment and endemic diseases, indispensable part in local production systems, social and cultural significance, and importance to local rural economies. The genetic resources of minor breeds have value to the local farmers, consumers of the products, private companies and investors interested in crossbreeding, breed associations, governments, those conducting research and development, and non-governmental organizations. Therefore, efforts have been made by national governments and non-governmental organizations, such as the Livestock Conservancy, to encourage conservation of livestock genetics through cryoconservation, as well as through other ex situ and in situ strategies. Cryogenic specimens of livestock genetic resources can be preserved and used for extended periods of time. This advantage makes cryoconservation beneficial particularly for threatened breeds who have low breed populations. Cryogenically preserved specimens can be used to revive breeds that are endangered or extinct, for breed improvement, crossbreeding, research and development. However, cryoconservation can be an expensive strategy and requires long term hygienic and economic commitment for germplasms to remain viable. Cryoconservation can also face unique challenges based on the species, as some species have a reduced survival rate of frozen germplasm.|$|E

40|$|For {{users of}} <b>germplasm</b> <b>collections,</b> {{the purpose of}} {{measuring}} characterization and evaluation descriptors, and subsequently using statistical methodology to summarize the data, {{is not only to}} interpret the relationships between the descriptors, but also to characterize the differences and similarities between accessions in relation to their phenotypic variability for each of the measured descriptors. The set of descriptors for the accessions of most <b>germplasm</b> <b>collections</b> consists of both numerical and categorical descriptors. This poses problems for a combined analysis of all descriptors because few statistical techniques deal with mixtures of measurement types. In this article, nonlinear principal component analysis was used to analyze the descriptors of the accessions in the Australian groundnut collection. It was demonstrated that the nonlinear variant of ordinary principal component analysis is an appropriate analytical tool because subspecies and botanical varieties could be identified {{on the basis of the}} analysis and characterized in terms of all descriptors. Moreover, outlying accessions could be easily spotted and their characteristics established.

50|$|Karl W. Hillig, a {{graduate}} student in the laboratory of long-time Cannabis researcher Paul G. Mahlberg at Indiana University, conducted a systematic investigation of genetic, morphological, and chemotaxonomic variation among 157 Cannabis accessions of known geographic origin, including fiber, drug, and feral populations. In 2004, Hillig and Mahlberg published a chemotaxonomic analysis of cannabinoid variation in their Cannabis <b>germplasm</b> <b>collection.</b> They used gas chromatography to determine cannabinoid content and to infer allele frequencies of the gene that controls CBD and THC production within the studied populations, and concluded that the patterns of cannabinoid variation support recognition of C. sativa and C. indica as separate species, but not C. ruderalis. The authors assigned fiber/seed landraces and feral populations from Europe, central Asia, and Asia Minor to C. sativa. Narrow-leaflet and wide-leaflet drug accessions, southern and eastern Asian hemp accessions, and feral Himalayan populations were assigned to C. indica. In 2005, Hillig published a genetic analysis of the same set of accessions (this paper was the first in the series, but was delayed in publication), and proposed a three-species classification, recognizing C. sativa, C. indica, and (tentatively) C. ruderalis. In his doctoral dissertation published the same year, Hillig stated that principal components analysis of phenotypic (morphological) traits failed to differentiate the putative species, but that canonical variates analysis resulted in a high degree of discrimination of the putative species and infraspecific taxa. Another paper in the series on chemotaxonomic variation in the terpenoid content of the essential oil of Cannabis revealed that several wide-leaflet drug strains in the collection had relatively high levels of certain sesquiterpene alcohols, including guaiol and isomers of eudesmol, that set them apart from the other putative taxa. Hillig concluded that the patterns of genetic, morphological, and chemotaxonomic variation support recognition of C. sativa and C. indica as separate species. He also concluded there is little support to treat C. ruderalis as a separate species from C. sativa at this time, but more research on wild and weedy populations is needed because they were underrepresented in their collection.|$|E

40|$|Gene {{banks have}} been {{established}} to conserve the genetic diversity of crop species. Large <b>germplasm</b> <b>collections</b> lead to management problems (space, maintenance costs, etc.), especially in collections involving species with recalcitrant seeds that must be maintained as growing plants. Core collections (CCs) are thus developed {{to reduce the size}} of large <b>germplasm</b> <b>collections</b> while keeping the maximum variability. This also facilitates fine phenotypic evaluation. In this study, several software packages (DARwin, PowerMarker and MSTRAT) and methods (Max length subtree, M strategy, simulated annealing and MinSD) were compared to define a mandarin (Citrus reticulata) CC. One hundred and sixty-seven accessions were sampled from two <b>germplasm</b> <b>collections,</b> which were genotyped with 50 SSR, 24 InDel and 68 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. All the CC obtained were tested for the maintenance of the genetic variability parameters (Ho and He) of the initial collection, the level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the phenotypic diversity retention. The Max length subtree function from DARWin seemed to be the most appropriate method for establishing a CC in C. reticulata. It maintained 96. 82 % of the allelic richness and 17. 96 % of the size of the initial collection with only 30 accessions. Besides it did not increase the LD (r 2 value) of the initial collection and retained the vast majority of the phenotypic variability. However, a CC with 70 accessions would be more helpful for genetic association studies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
