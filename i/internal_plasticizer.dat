40|$|Polymers {{derived from}} bio-acceptable poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly(2 -methoxyethyl acrylate) (PMEA), and poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) (PPEGMA) have been {{prepared}} via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) utilizing an initiator prepared from a fluoroalkoxy-terminated oligoethylene glycol. Polymerizations are controlled as seen by both linear first-order kinetics and molecular weight evolution coupled with low polydispersities (< 1. 25) with respect to conversion. A range of ligands have been used depending upon {{the nature of the}} monomer: N-(n-propyl) - 2 -pyridyl-methanimine with the methacrylates MMA and PEGMA and 1, 1, 4, 7, 10, 10 -hexamethyltriethylene tetramine (HMTETA) with MEA. In all cases the use of the fluorinated initiator results in a lower apparent rate of propagation (k(p) (aPP)) as compared with the more conventional and nonfluorinated initiator, ethyl 2 -bromoisobutyrate. The initiator generally also serves as an <b>internal</b> <b>plasticizer</b> lowering the glass transition temperature from the parent polymers. The surface characteristics of the fluoroinitiator containing polymers are altered compared with the nonfluorinated analogues. This is reflected in {{a significant increase in the}} advancing water contact angles of all fluoro-containing polymers. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} the photorefractive {{properties}} of (2, 4, 7 -trinitro- 9 -fluorenylidene) malononitrile (TNFM) sensitized poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) /N-ethylcarbazole (ECZ) polymer composites doped with two structurally related chromophores. Characterization included four-wave mixing experiments, two-beam coupling and photoconductivity measurements at a wavelength of 780 nm. At an applied field of 48 V/mum, we have observed complete internal diffraction and gain coefficients exceeding 120 cm(- 1). A small alteration in the chromophore donor group substituents was used to tune the ionization potential of the dopant dye. This affected the grating build-up time and photorefractive phase shift. As an application, we demonstrate the operation of a photorefractive novelty filter using a 120 -mum-thick sample. The performance of the polymer composites is {{compared to that of}} three newly synthesized polymethacrylates functionalized with carbazole, a dodecyl chain as an <b>internal</b> <b>plasticizer</b> and three different dyes. Here, we have observed net two-beam coupling gain and a diffraction efficiency of 60 % at 58 V/mum. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics in {{solution}} and photochromic properties of radical copolymers of (S) - 4 -[N-(2 -methacryloyloxyethyl) -N- (2 -methylbutyl) ]amino- 4 '-cyanoazobenzene with butyl methacrylate were investigated. C- 13 NMR and 2 D heteronuclear correlated (HETCOR) spectroscopy allowed assignment of C- 13 NMR signals {{and evaluation of}} main chain tacticity. C- 13 relaxation times T- 1 evidenced a rather limited mobility of azobenzene chromophores. Mobility increases with increasing content of butyl methacrylate units, that acts as an <b>internal</b> <b>plasticizer.</b> The limited mobility of the spacer between azobenzene and methacrylate groups is attributed to an interaction between carbonyl oxygen and aminic nitrogen stabilized by the internal charge transfer from the amino to the cyano group. Trans to cis photoisomerization rates {{turned out to be}} independent of molecular weight and chemical composition of the investigated photochromic polymers, whereas cis to trans thermal isomerization rates increase with the content of aromatic units. These data suggest that photo- and thermal isomerization processes imply an in-plane inversion and an out-of-plane rotation of one of the phenyl rings of the azobenzene chromophores, respectively. Preliminary second harmonic generation measurements indicate that the investigated polymers are endowed with significant non-linear optical properties...|$|E
40|$|Starch a cheap, {{abundant}} and renewable natural material has been chemically modified for many years. The popular modification acylation {{has been used}} to adjust rheological properties as well as deliver polymers with <b>internal</b> <b>plasticizers</b> and other potential uses. However the harsh reaction conditions required to produce these esters may limit their use, especially in sensitive applications (foods, pharmaceuticals, etc.). The use of enzymes to catalyse acylation may provide a suitable alternative due to high selectivities and mild reaction conditions. Traditional hydrolase-catalysed synthesis in non-aqueous apolar media is hard due to lack of polysaccharide solubility. However, acylated starch derivatives have recently been successfully produced in other non-conventional systems: (a) surfactant-solubilised subtilisin and suspended amylose in organic media; (b) starch nanoparticles dispersed in organic medium with immobilised lipase; (c) aqueous starch gels with lipase and dispersed fatty acids. We attempt a systematic review that draws parallels between the seemingly unrelated approaches described...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (DSc (Chemistry and Polymer Science)) [...] University of Stellenbsoch, 2006. The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} a new tertiary alcohol (2 -octyl- 2 -dodecanol) and “bushy-tailed”, hydrophobic acrylic monomer (2 -octyl-dodecyl acrylate) from a 1 -decene dimer (2 -octyl- 1 -dodecene) precursor that was synthesized with metallocene technology is reported. Some preliminary applications of the newly synthesized 2 -octyl-dodecyl acrylate were investigated. These applications included the use of 2 -octyl-dodecyl acrylate as a reactive hydrophobe in mini-emulsion polymerizations, and as a reactive (<b>internal)</b> <b>plasticizer.</b> In an attempt to selectively dimerize 1 -decene, the effect of various factors on the oligomerization of 1 -decene was investigated. These factors include the following: i. Different temperatures: 5, 35, 70 and 90 °C ii. Different co-catalyst [methylaluminoxane (MAO) ] concentrations iii. Different catalysts: bis(cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride (Cp 2 ZrCl 2) and bis(cyclopentadienyl) hafnium dichloride (Cp 2 HfCl 2) iv. Different reaction times. In all instances the final product obtained, under the abovementioned conditions, {{was a mixture of}} residual monomer, the dimer and trimer of 1 -decene. These findings were corroborated with GC-MS and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. The isolation and further processing of the dimer of 1 -decene (2 -octyl- 1 -dodecene) was investigated. The efficiency, in terms of the final product-composition for the amount of catalyst used and reaction time, of Cp 2 ZrCl 2 compared to bis(cyclopentadienyl) hafnium dichloride (Cp 2 HfCl 2; hafnocene) as catalyst for the oligomerization of 1 -decene is also reported on. The results obtained indicated that Cp 2 ZrCl 2 is the more efficient catalyst for the oligomerization of 1 -decene. The effect of different reaction times (1, 3, 6, 24 hours) on the final product-composition for the oligomerization of 1 -decene was also investigated. Longer reaction times (24 hours) seemed to be excessive. A reaction time of 6 hours was optimal. The purified 1 -decene dimer (2 -octyl- 1 -dodecene) was converted to the new tertiary alcohol (2 -octyl- 2 -dodecanol) using the oxymercuration-demercuration procedure. The 2 -octyl-dodecyl acrylate was synthesized by the esterification of the tertiary alcohol with acryloyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine. The new tertiary alcohol and acrylate were characterized by FT-IR and 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. Stable polymer latex particles were successfully synthesized with the novel reactive hydrophobe 2 -octyl-dodecyl acrylate in the mini-emulsion polymerization of butyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and styrene. Phase-separation experiments showed that the presence of 2 -octyl-dodecyl acrylate in the dispersed phase retards Ostwald ripening. The novel acrylic monomer, 2 -octyl-dodecyl acrylate, was copolymerized with styrene via conventional free radical polymerization. Both low and high molecular weight copolymers were prepared. Thermal analysis of the copolymers showed that 2 -octyl-dodecyl acrylate does act as a reactive (<b>internal)</b> <b>plasticizer.</b> Blends of commercial virgin polystyrene and the synthesized low and high molecular weight copolymers were prepared. Partially miscible blends were obtained. Decreases in the glass transition temperatures of the blends compared to the virgin polystyrene were observed. The higher molecular mass styrene/ 2 -octyl-dodecyl acrylate copolymers produced larger decreases in glass-transition temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The paint {{materials}} {{in three different}} Keith Haring outdoormurals, Tuttomondo in Pisa (1989), the Necker Hospital mural in Paris (1987), and the Melbourne mural (1984), were investigated using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS). The aimof the studywas to characterize the chemical composition of the paintmaterials used by the artist in the three mural paintings and to correlate their chemical composition to their state of conservation. The analyses were performed using a PY- 3030 D pyrolyzer (Frontier Lab, Japan). The analyses of the paint samples fromTuttomondo showed {{the presence of a}} styrene/n-butylacrylate copolymer, which had been used as a paint binder. The results were then compared with those obtained with a Pyroprobe 5000 pyrolyzer (CDS Analytical, U. S. A.). The pyrolysis profiles of the paint samples of the Paris muralwere characterized by the presence of benzene and acetic acid, together with small amounts of toluene, styrene, indene, and different aromatic compounds, which indicated the presence of a vinyl resin. The various isomers of the vinyl ester of versatic acid were attributed to VeoVaTM, present in the vinyl polymer as an <b>internal</b> <b>plasticizer.</b> In the Melbourne mural, there was a high heterogeneity of paint materials, both original and deriving from a restoration intervention. The Py-GC/MS analyses revealed the presence of alkyd, vinyl, and acrylic resins. The samples were collected within the framework of conservation campaigns carried out on the three artworks. The results enabled the materials used by the artist to be identified, and highlighted the conservation state of the murals. They also provided conservators and restorers with helpful information for the choice of cleaning and protection procedures. Having access to three different examples of Haring's street art enabled us to compare the paint techniques and to relate them to the state of conservation...|$|E
