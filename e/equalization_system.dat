40|$|The {{presence}} of voluntary deductibles in the Swiss and Dutch mandatory health insurance {{has important implications}} for the respective risk <b>equalization</b> <b>systems.</b> In a theoretical analysis, we discuss the consequences of equalizing three types of expenditures: the net claims that are reimbursed by the insurer, the out-of-pocket expenditures and the expenditure savings due to moral hazard reduction. Equalizing only the net claims, as done in Switzerland, creates incentives for cream skimming and prevents insurers from incorporating out-of-pocket expenditures and moral hazard reductions into their premium structure. In an empirical analysis, we examine the effect of self-selection and conclude that the Swiss and Dutch risk <b>equalization</b> <b>systems</b> do not fully adjust for differences in health status between those who choose a deductible and those who do not. We discuss how this may lead to incentives for cream skimming and to a reduction of cross-subsidies from healthy to unhealthy individuals compared to a situation without voluntary deductibles. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a model of fiscal {{equalization}} in Croatia. This paper tests the hypothesis of a lack of effectiveness of the existing fiscal equalization model compared to a model that would be based on alleviating the difference in the potential to collect revenue from the personal income tax and surtax. Fiscal inequalities of local government units are determined first under the current <b>equalization</b> <b>system</b> by calculating the Gini coefficients and graphically presented with Lorenz curves. Thereafter, a distribution of equalization grants is simulated based on the new (proposed) model. The effectiveness of the proposed model in alleviating the fiscal inequalities is determined in relation to the effectiveness of the current <b>equalization</b> <b>system.</b> It was found that the model based on equalizing the difference in the capacity to collect revenue from the personal income tax and surtax alleviates inequalities in fiscal capacities of local government units much better than the existing system at the same cost. The main conclusion is that the fiscal equalization in Croatia should urgently be redesigned in order to improve efficiency and fairness, but also the transparency and credibility of the <b>equalization</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} its long history, reform of {{financial}} equalization at local government level has not brought the necessary improvements in efficiency.

Therefore, this paper compares the financial equalization law of two Laender (Baden-Wuerttemberg and Saxony) in order to research its suitability under different socio-economic conditions.

Political yardstick competition, based on a comparison of public services and tax rates with those in nearby jurisdictions, can provide voters with a useful instrument to help solve this asymmetric information problem. However, is has been shown that fiscal disparities bias this yardstick. A politician in a fiscally advantaged jurisdiction can perform badly and still compare favorably, even if his neighbors perform well.
