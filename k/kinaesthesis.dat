40|$|To {{determine}} the displacement sensitivity function for human <b>kinaesthesis,</b> movements with different peak velocities were {{imposed on the}} fingertip, using the PHANToM robot arm with a modified thimble attachment. Displacement thresholds were determined adaptively with a staircase method and the method of constant stimulus, and no {{significant difference was found}} between testing methods. The results suggest that the PHANToM can be used effectively to study human <b>kinaesthesis</b> in conjunction with efficient methods for threshold estimation that have not been previously applied to movement detection tasks. 1 Introduction The development of advanced haptic interfaces requires information about the psychophysical capabilities of the human observer, such as the ability to sense movement and position of the hand and fingers. The relationship between human proprioception and <b>kinaesthesis</b> has been investigated using a number of psychophysical methods. Using a task in which sensed positi [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} study {{focuses on the}} role of <b>kinaesthesis</b> and motor response in promoting musical memory. The main questions addressed are: What is the nature of musical memory? How is it promoted? Is a kinaesthetic or muscular strategy a particularly effective means of promoting musical memory? The investigation which follows is mainly conceptual, yet reinforced by some empirical work. It falls into three parts: 1) Cognitive processes; 2) The potential role of <b>kinaesthesis</b> and movement as imagery strategies; 3) Empirical investigation. In part one a framework for the investigation is established. The study of general aspects of memory is linked to research in music cognition and memory. A chapter on representation and imagery is concerned with those techniques and strategies by which musical memory is developed. Part two examines the nature of <b>kinaesthesis</b> and its role in cognitive processes and musical cognition. Rhythmic experience is considered in relation to <b>kinaesthesis</b> and its overt manifestation in physical movement. The major contribution of Emile Jaques- Dalcroze is presented, as a study of kinaesthetic strategy in practice. The close correspondence between music and expressive movement is examined, before a chapter in which a conceptual framework is proposed. The third and final part presents the empirical work undertaken in testing the kinaesthetic principle: 'The stronger the muscular sensations, the clearer and more precise the images' (Jaques-Dalcroze) A replication experiment is described which forms the basis for an experiment on kinaesthetic strategy, the success of which lends support to the theoretical evidence presented. Conclusions are drawn and Dalcroze practice reviewed in the light of these findings and the preceding theoretical work...|$|E

The provocation test, when the plate is suddenly swiveled out with a provocation unit, can model the equilibration ability of the person being investigated. In this study the oscillation (swing) characteristics of 45 healthy, young subjects, 11 professional handball players, 24 patients after medial meniscectomy, 20 elderly, healthy subjects, and 20 patients with hip osteoarthritis were identified in terms of provocation. The oscillation (swing) characteristics of provocation were identified by average logarithmic decrement, Lehr’s damping ratio, frequency and own frequency. <b>Kinaesthesis</b> can be described by analyzing {{the results of the}} measurements performed.

40|$|Two {{potential}} sources of information allow the nervous system to determine limb position in egocentric space: (i) limb <b>kinaesthesis</b> and (ii) extraretinal cues to direction and distance. We argue that both of these information sources arise from essentially similar physiological origins - copies of the central commands issued by the nervous system together with afferent discharge fed back from the relevant peripheral effecters. A {{number of studies have}} demonstrated that judgements of limb position are more accurate when limb <b>kinaesthesis</b> is combined with extraretinal cues. We review some recent studies which suggest that the weighting attached to these two sources of information varies {{as a function of the}} amount of retinal detail present within the environment. We conclude by considering how the perception of limb position may be affected in cases of abnormal movement control. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} subject and object with regard to constitution in Edmund Husserl’s phenomenology. The study is primarily based on the publication ‘Analyses concerning passive and active synthesis : lectures on transcendental logic’, and seeks to understand this relationship between subject and object through the Husserlian terms of <b>kinaesthesis,</b> stream of consciousness and constitution. Both <b>kinaesthesis</b> and stream of consciousness are thoroughly treated and examined in the study’s analysis part. Furthermore, the study incorporates critique and responses from the philosophers Marvin Farber (in ‘First Philosophy and the Problem of the World) and Rudolf Bernet (in ‘En intentionalitet uden subjekt og objekt?’), with focus on {{their view of the}} relationship between subject and object as well as the epistemological and ontological questions that subsequently arise. The study finds, through analysis and discussion of the aforementioned terms and critique, that both subject and object are invariably dependent upon one another in their constitution. The study also finds that the epistemological and ontological questions themselves are brought about by Husserl’s use of the epoché as a type of methodological doubt...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} analyze <b>kinaesthesis</b> of motion, the author used a ZEBRIS ultrasound-based {{measuring}} system with single active markers. In essence, the measurement involves {{the determination of}} the spatial positions of different anatomical points on the human body while a person is stepping on firm and non-firm plates, which also have active markers attached. This type of measurement can model the correction ability of the person being examined. The provocation test, when the plate is suddenly swivelled out with a provocation unit, can model the equilibration ability of the person being investigated. In this study the kinematic and oscillation (swing) characteristics of 50 healthy persons were identified during stepping and provocation. The kinematic characteristics of stepping were identified by measuring the range of knee motion in all three directions of space and the range of motion of the shoulder girdle and pelvis in a local coordinate system of segments (shoulder girdle and pelvis). The oscillation (swing) characteristics of provocation were identified by average logarithmic decrement, Lehr’s damping ratio, frequency and own frequency. <b>Kinaesthesis</b> can be described by analyzing the results of the measurements performed...|$|E

In particular, we experience our bodies in two quite different ways, corresponding to different sensory channels: we see our body as a highly familiar, structured object; and we feel our bodies as locations of specific somatosensory experiences, such as touch and <b>kinaesthesis.</b> This distinc-tion between sensory sources is maintained at higher, cognitive levels of representation. In particular, psychol-ogists have traditionally distinguished between a body image and a body schema (Gallagher, 1986; Paillard, 2005).

40|$|My {{subject in}} this essay is kine-aesthetics, the {{perception}} of movement, {{and its role in}} dance speetatorship. I am revisiting territory closely associated with dance critic and theorist John Martin, along with his somewhat discredited notion of kinaesthetic empathy. I will suggest that the questions Martin posed concerning the nature of dance communication are still pertinent, as is his intention, however imperfectly realized, to develop a dance poetics that is sensitive to a bodily, sensory logic. 'How is it that I am moved when a dancer moves?' Martin asked. To respond to this question today requires, amongst other things, a re-examination of the perceptual processes underpinning dance production and reception. Writing in 1939, in the midst of modernist experimentation, "Martin reasoned that if dance was to be an autonomous, or absolute art, its modes of representation and expression must be unique to it. Comparable to the isolation of optical experience in modernist painting, :Ylartin identified <b>kinaesthesis,</b> the perception of movement, as the essential ground of absolute dance. But kinaesthetic perception is a complex business. Despite "Martin's efforts to align his theory of dance reception with modernist precepts, the perception of (dance) movement is not reducible to a singular sensory modality. <b>Kinaesthesis,</b> the 'pick up' of movement, cannot be isolated to a specific group of receptors, but cuts across functional perceptual systems. The visual, the articular and the haptic/ tactile systems may all be involved in movement perception. In this essay I will suggest that dance speetatorship entails a complex mode of visual <b>kinaesthesis,</b> that is, a way of looking which is intricately interwoven with the sense of touch. I will describe thekinaesthesia of the dancing body in textural terms, as given to both vision and touch. A key resource for the paper is the work of cognitive psychologist James Gibson. Gibson's insights concerning the nature and function of the sensory-perceptual systems have had an important impact upon American experimental dance. In particular, his understanding of the interplay between visual and haptic systems provided theoretical support and experimental data for dancers' creative exploration of the relationship between movement, perception and bodily change. Gibson's work has also been important in developing alternative approaches to dance and movement training. It has informed the philosophy and methods of Contact Improvisation, Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen's Body-Mind Centering and Todd alignment/ideokinesis...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to create system of {{meaningful}} breathing exercises suitable for continuous improvement of singer's breath. In order to reach our goal, we had to divide this thesis into two fundamental parts; theoretical and practical. The theoretical part describes anatomical and - physiological relationship among parts of upper airways, breathing muscles, and theory, which {{emphasizes the importance of}} breath control achieved through conscious exercises. The practical part consists of five independent sections, each containing exercises for practicing basic breathing types. Correct performance of these exercises, greatly enhances the overall respiratory function capability, improves <b>kinaesthesis</b> not only for respiratory muscles, but also for muscles providing postural function. Furthermore, properly executed exercises also improve awareness, which must be an integrant of the all exercises which we indicate for singer's breath training...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{establish}} the role of perceptual-motor factors in copying an equilateral four-sided figure. Children, 5 to 12 years, and adults, were asked to copy the figure presented in either "square" or "diamond" orientation under five conditions: control; large model presentation; neutral picture frame surround: partial visual information reduction; and total visual information loss. The model was present at all times. Scores were orientation and angular variability. Developmental trends were found for both figures: the diamond was less well performed than the square at all ages tested. Three perceptual-motor factors were found to be important: formulation of the movement plan: movement programming, and sensory feedback. The difficulty of the diamond is thought to be due to the high programming and hence planning demands in drawing oblique lines. Both <b>kinaesthesis</b> and sequential vision are important factors in drawing; and only from 12 years of age are environmental cues used efficiently to orient the figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{explored}} {{the degree to}} which vision may alter kinaesthetic perception by asking participants to view their hand through a prism, introducing different horizontal deviations, while trying to align their fingers above and below a thin table. When the visual image of one hand was displaced this overwhelmed kinaesthetic judgements and participants reliably reported that they felt their limbs were aligned, even when they were laterally misaligned by as much as 10 cm. This effect, however, was mediated by visual capture and when the task was attempted in a darkened room with limb position indicated by an LED taped to the finger, <b>kinaesthesis</b> dominated and participants reported that the LED seemed to become detached from their finger tip. In both light and dark conditions the finger was clearly visible and only the background detail was extinguished. Hence, in perceiving limb position, it appears that we believe in what we see, rather than in what we feel, when the visual background is rich, and in what we feel when the visual background is sparse...|$|E
40|$|Objective: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether position sense acuity of the upper extremity and tracking performance, pen pressure and muscle activity in a tracking task are af-fected in subjects with neck and upper extremity pain. Methods: Twenty-three subjects with neck and upper extrem-ity pain and 26 healthy controls participated in the study. Position sense acuity of the upper extremity was measured while subjects pointed at targets, without vision of their arm and hand. In the computer tracking task, subjects were in-structed to position a cursor within a moving target dot, us-ing a pen on a tablet. Results: Position sense acuity of the upper extremity was im-paired in subjects with pain. Their variable error was 20 – 30 % larger than in healthy controls. Subjects with pain also showed reduced tracking precision. Both the mean and the standard deviation of the distance to target were significant-ly larger in subjects with pain than in healthy controls, 10 % and 13 % respectively. No differences between groups were found in pen pressure and muscle activity during tracking. Conclusion: The results suggest that subjects with pain are limited in performing precision tasks due to impaired po-sition sense of the upper extremity, but do not compensate with increased effort.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{developmental}} course of striking action. This cross-sectional study explored the refinement of striking in 28 children aged between 4 and 12 years and investigated how well they could use <b>kinaesthesis</b> to gauge the length of an unseen bat. The kinematic data (including smoothness of movement) showed quantitative differences between the age groups. In contrast, no differences were found in the children 2 ̆ 7 s ability to judge the length of the unseen bat: within three strikes all of the children had made a clean hit, indicating that they had successfully judged bat length. The children then appeared to memorize the bat with which they had accurately hit the target and made: (1) minimal errors when using this bat in later trials and (2) predictable errors when using two other bats of different sizes. The results show that the striking action becomes optimized over childhood, with smoothness of movement providing an index of this refinement. The findings also suggest that young children have a higher level of kinaesthetic sensitivity than has been assumed previously on the basis of static limb positioning tasks. The results suggest that the striking task used in this study might be a useful tool for investigating the development of movement skills in children with developmental disorders...|$|E
40|$|Active {{and passive}} {{movements}} in the calibration of position sense* J. PAILLARD and M. BROUCHON Spatially coordinated behavior is possible only because many features of the body's structure and {{of the structure of}} the world are highly predictable. From the primitive chaos of the impressions collected by our sense organs, a system of stable and permanent spatial referents progressively emerges in relation to the moving and ever-changing framework of bodily positions. The prerequisite to the building up of motor strategies directed at the outside world lies in the establishment of a known system of spatial relationships among the different mobile parts of the body and a method of evaluating continuously their relative positions. The initial and final positions of any moving segment must primarily be referred to the proprioceptive spatial schema upon which the various displacements related to each joint of the bony frame may be ordered. Studies devoted to position sense have, for the most part, focused upon the problem of <b>kinaesthesis</b> in order to gain knowledge of our ability to estimate changes in position of our joints and to reproduce these changes with more or less precision in distance, speed, and direction. They have tended to neglect the problem of the calibration of these positions in the spatial reference system of the body, which is itself situated within, or moves itself in, invariant perceptual space. This is a problem which places the study of kinesthetic sensation at the level of the mechanisms which confer upon it its “local sign. ...|$|E
40|$|This article {{sets out}} to present a fairly {{comprehensive}} review of our knowledge about {{the functions of the}} receptors that have been found in the extraocular muscles [...] the six muscles that move each eye of vertebrates in its orbit [...] of all the animals in which they have been sought, including Man. Since their discovery {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century these receptors have, at various times, been credited with important roles in the control of eye movement and the construction of extrapersonal space and have also been denied any function whatsoever. Experiments intended to study the actions of eye muscle receptors and, even more so, opinions (and indeed polemic) derived from these observations have been influenced by the changing fashions and beliefs about the more general question of how limb position and movement is detected by the brain and which signals contribute to those aspects of this that are perceived (<b>kinaesthesis).</b> But the conclusions drawn from studies on the eye have also influenced beliefs about the mechanisms of <b>kinaesthesis</b> and, arguably, this influence has been even larger than that in the converse direction. Experimental evidence accumulated over rather more than a century is set out and discussed. It supports the view that, at the beginning of the 21 st century, there are excellent grounds for believing that the receptors in the extraocular muscles are indeed proprioceptors, that is to say that the signals that they send into the brain are used to provide information about the position and movement of the eye in the orbit. It seems that this information is important in the control of eye movements of at least some types, and in the determination by the brain of the direction of gaze and the relationship of the organism to its environment. In addition, signals from these receptors in the eye muscles are seen to be necessary for the development of normal mechanisms of visual analysis in the mammalian visual cortex and for both the development and maintenance of normal visuomotor behaviour. Man is among those vertebrates to whose brains eye muscle proprioceptive signals provide information apparently used in normal sensorimotor functions; these include various aspects of perception, and of the control of eye movement. It is possible that abnormalities of the eye muscle proprioceptors and their signals may play a part in the genesis of some types of human squint (strabismus); conversely studies of patients with squint in the course of their surgical or pharmacological treatment have yielded much interesting evidence about the central actions of the proprioceptive signals from the extraocular muscles. The results of experiments on the eye have played a large part in the historical controversy, now in at least its third century, about the origin of signals that inform the brain about movement of parts of the body. Some of these results, and more of the interpretations of them, now need to be critically re-examined. The re-examination in the light of recent experiments that is presented here does not support many of the conclusions confidently drawn in the past and leads to both new insights and fresh questions about the roles of information from motor signals flowing out of the brain and that from signals from the peripheral receptors flowing into it. There remain many lacunae in our knowledge and filling some of these will, it is contended, be essential to advance our understanding further. It is argued that such understanding of eye muscle proprioception is a necessary part of the understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of eye movement control and that it is also essential to an account of how organisms, including Man, build and maintain knowledge of their relationship to the external visual world. The eye would seem to provide a uniquely favourable system in which to study the way in which information derived within the brain about motor actions may interact with signals flowing in from peripheral receptors. The review is constructed in relatively independent sections that deal with particular topics. It ends with a fairly brief piece in which the author sets out some personal views about what has been achieved recently and what most immediately needs to be done. It also suggests some lines of study that appear to the author to be important for the future...|$|E
40|$|The jazz avant-garde of the 60 s and 70 s {{has often}} been {{depicted}} as a movement that signalled the end of jazz as {{we had come to}} know it, a movement of unbridled musical energy and passion without the essential restraining influences of formal guidelines and reverence for - traditions. With the benefit of hindsight, from observing the almost neoclassical stance of jazz in the 80 s, the notion that this music signified the genre's Armaggedon was patently a misconception. This thesis argues that free jazz was as much a style, concerned with finding its own voice and technical vocabulary, as any other period of jazz history. As an analytical and critical study of pianists and their use of the piano in free jazz and improvised music, this survey is designed to fill a gap in musicological research of this important artistic movement, which hitherto has been primarily concerned with biography and with related sociological issues. The study traces the piano through the turbulent years of radical experirnentalism in jazz and the subsequent refinement in free improvisation in Europe and the U. S. through the work of pianists central to the movement. Rather than adopting the chronological approach, this study considers the music under broad headings specifically related to technique; the instrument's position within the group, and the generation of form, motivic structure and 'language'. Chapter 1, by way of introduction, outlines the argument of what constitutes the 'freedom' in free jazz and looks at the early development of the avant garde as it arose in opposition to the prevailing traditions of bebop and contemporary notated music with special reference to three influential pianists: Herbie Nichols, Lennie Tristano and Thelonius Monk. Chapter 2 is concerned with new concepts in overall form, while Chapter 3 takes {{a closer look at the}} smaller components, or motifs, of modular improvisatory structure. Chapter 4 examines the physical nature of piano tones, their unique qualities of sustain and resonance and their changing patterns of distribution in this music; looking at 'space' firstly in the sense of the piano's natural resonance and the pianists whose work has explored this particular characteristic, and secondly, the physical space involved in the act of playing, the sense of movement or <b>kinaesthesis.</b> Chapter 5 will concentrate on the dynamic and percussive approach to free jazz piano. Chapter 6 turns from the physiological to the psychological processes of improvisation; how the opposing forces of habit and originality assert themselves in the improviser's art.
