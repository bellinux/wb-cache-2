50|$|Declawing of crabs is {{the process}} whereby one or both claws of a live crab (including king crabs) are {{manually}} pulled off and the animal is {{then returned to the}} water. It occurs in several fisheries worldwide, such as in the Florida stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) fishery, the north-east Atlantic <b>deep-water</b> <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> (Chaceon affinis) fishery and in southern Iberia, where the major claws of the fiddler crab Uca tangeri are harvested. Around Northern Europe, an extensive fishery exists for claws of the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. The practice is defended because some crabs can naturally autotomise (shed) limbs and then about a year later after a series of moults, regenerate these limbs. It is argued that declawing therefore provides a sustainable fishery. Claw removal is also promoted to assist in handling of animals, and to decrease losses through entanglement in nets and cannibalism. Declawing crabs is legal in the UK since revocation in 2000 of the Crab Claws (Prohibition of Landing) Order 1986. One crab that is subject to widespread declawing is the Florida stone crab, for which tourist information is provided.|$|E
40|$|Annual {{landings}} of the <b>deep-water</b> <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> (Chaceon affinis) in the NE Atlantic have fluctuated around 1000 t {{for much}} of the past decade, but they dropped significantly in 2006. No EU or National Member State legislation governs the harvest of the species, and because of the on-board processing, it is difficult to set a single minimum landing size (MLS) based on carapace width (CW) alone. As the claws are detached during processing and represent the most valuable component of the catch, a supplementary MLS based on claw length (CL) for onshore inspection and enforcement would seem appropriate. Physiological size-at-maturity and morphometric claw data were used to derive primary (CW) and secondary (CL) MLS. All males and females are mature at 110 and 125 mm CW, respectively, and 50 % of females are mature at 109 mm CW. Because of a lack of information relating to the biology, distribution, and fishing mortality of the species, and a doubt as to real landing statistics, a conservative MLS of 120 mm CW and 72 mm CL is suggested, representing the first use of commercial fisheries data to suggest MLS for this otherwise unregulated fishery...|$|E

All mating pairs were found at the interface of the Mediterranean Outflow Water with North Atlantic Deep Water, suggesting that environmental parameters associated with the interface of these water masses may be relevant for mating in this species. The majority of C. affinis was mating which is an indication of synchrony and reproductive seasonality. A biennial female reproductive cycle is hypothesized, involving molting and mating in the first year with subsequent oviposition during the autumn, and spawning during spring of the second year. We suggest that synchrony and seasonality in the reproduction of C. affinis is linked to the formation of phytoplankton blooms in surface waters, with females carrying embryos from autumn to spring, possibly timing the release of planktotrophic larvae to exploit a seasonal peak in surface productivity and its export...|$|E

50|$|One {{environmental}} parameter {{that requires}} regulatory {{function of the}} <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> is the season due to the temperature change.

In spring (May), female <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> move to shallow coastal areas to moult and spawn, and males join the females in the shallow water prior to moulting. In the summer (mid-June through mid-November), these crabs spend their time in fairly deep water, below established summer thermocline.

50|$|Overall, the <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> {{have a high}} {{adaptation}} {{capacity in}} changes of salinity level because the crabs retain their vital functions and also their feeding locomotor activities. However, {{there is a difference}} in the salinity tolerance between juvenile <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> and adult <b>red</b> king <b>crabs.</b> Juvenile <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> are slightly more tolerant to low concentrations of salinity because the juvenile's volume regulation is significantly better. Juveniles are consistently hyposmotic to the seawater because they have lower sodium concentration in their hemolymph. Due to the smaller size of the juveniles their exoskeleton is structurally more rigid. The adult <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> are hyperosmotic in high salinity and becomes hyposmotic in lower salinity. The hyperosmoticity is due to the higher sodium and potassium concentrations in the hemolymph compared to the surrounding water they live in.|$|R

40|$|Stomach {{contents}} of benthic <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> (Pleuroncodes planipes) were analyzed to document {{number of items}} and composition. The crabs were captured along a series of latitudinal transects covering depths from 50 to 250 m, during March (12 stations) and September 1990 (8 stations). The number of food items decreased significantly from March to September at 150 and 200 m depth, the only strata compared since <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> are usually absent from the coast above 100 m in summer. The particulate organic matter (POM) varied from 60 to 70 % of total food items. The zooplankton fraction, mainly crustaceans, foraminiferans, and radiolarians, was second in importance. Phytoplankton was the next most important group, and was represented by 17 genera in March and 11 in September. The mean number of diatoms in stomachs per station decreased significantly (73. 5 versus 7) from March to September. The number of genera/station showed the same pattern (5. 36 versus 3. 6). The most abundant (number of cells) and frequent (presence over number of stations) diatom genera in March were Nitzschia, Melosira and Cocconeis in that order, accounting for 74 % of the relative importance index. In September, Cyclotella, Nitzschia and Melosira accounted for 42 % of the importance index. The stomach contents in benthic <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> indicate a decreasing availability of food in the area from winter-spring through the summer.

40|$|Red crab (Chaceon sp.) fishery {{resources}} {{exist on}} both sides on the North Atlantic, and the fisheries that harvest these resources seek to maintain their sustainability. This study contributed {{to the body of}} knowledge of the resource in the western Atlantic resource and <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> fishery off the Northeast US coast, and of the resource in the eastern Atlantic and emerging <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> fishery in the Cape Verde Islands off West Africa. ^ One aspect of this study assessed the characteristics of sea-sampled catches in the western and eastern Atlantic as indicators of population characteristics. In the western Atlantic, I investigated the past and current status of the population, changes in the size distribution of the <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> population due to fishing and the effects of discarding. I used data from a tagging study initiated in 2010 and 2004 - 2005 trawl survey by Dr. Richard Wahle of the University of Maine. I have supplemented these data with National Marine Fisheries Service trawl-survey data from 1974, and data that I collected in the summer of 2012 and 2013 aboard <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> commercial fishing vessels. In the eastern Atlantic, I used data collected during four exploratory fishing trips on a virgin resource located in the Cape Verde Islands. ^ In general, the life history characteristics of <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> resources are similar in the western and eastern Atlantic in terms of carapace width and size-frequency distribution. Males are always larger than females. In the western Atlantic I found {{that there has been a}} size increase in the harvested male population between 2010 and 2012, and I hypothesize that this could be due to a decrease in fishing effort overall, or is a response to an effort to return the smaller males to the sea. I also documented that there is a discard mortality of male and female <b>red</b> <b>crabs,</b> but the level of this mortality is small, and interestingly, corresponds to a level reported by a previous researcher based on 2 ̆ 2 hotel experiments. 2 ̆ 2 The fishery in the western Atlantic, although certified sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council, experiences the effects of moderate fishing intensity on males, and is considered fully exploited. I observed a change in the selectivity of fishermen when sorting the <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> catch from the trap, as the discard probability function has become steeper and resembles a more knife-edge selection process. ^ As for male <b>red</b> <b>crab,</b> the result of a length-based catch curve analysis (LCCA) indicates evidence of higher fishing mortality (F) in recent years (2012) for the northern area (F = 0. 47) compared to the southern area (F = 0. 20). Although this finding reflects the current fishery status, the estimated F value might be overestimated due to the more selective nature of trap surveys (the catch is aggregated toward the mean carapace width) and these values are valid only for the localized areas (600 - 800 meters) where the fishing operations occur. Although there has been concern regarding mating success of females due to lack of large males, I found no evidence to support this hypothesis. I found that the probability of successful mating in the logistic model increases as a carapace width increases. I also made a comparison of mating success from the 1974 to the 2004 - 05 surveys for the southern area, and that indicates a higher probability of mating success in the more recent years. ^ I separated the <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> population in the northwest Atlantic into two sub-stocks, with Hudson Canyon as a biogeographic barrier dividing the population along the upper continental slope off New England (north) and the mid-Atlantic (south), so as to be able to differentiate effects of fishing on the older mature fishery in the north and east form the newer fishery in the south. The results of a biomass dynamic model used to estimate maximum sustainable yield (MSY) found that the total MSY is estimated to be 1797 mt; this level is slightly higher than the current Total Allowable Landing (TAL) that was set at 1775 mt. The average fishing mortality in the northern area (0. 13) was lower than that in the southern area (0. 17), and both values are lower than the values estimated form the LCCA analysis. The F/FMSY and B/BMSY ratios from north and south areas indicate that the <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> resource is neither overfished nor is overfishing occurring in the most recent year (2012).

40|$|Mortality of {{demersal}} fish eggs caused by predation {{was investigated in}} this research project. The selected prey species were the Barents Sea capelin Mallotus villosus and lumpsucker Cyclopterus lumpus L, while the selected predators were capelin itself by cannibalistic behaviour and the invasive <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> Paralithodes camtschaticus. Both capelin and lumpsucker are commercially important species in the Norwegian fisheries, but capelin {{is also a very}} important forage fish for other species. The egg guarding lumpsucker male was not able to protect his eggs from the egg feeding <b>red</b> king <b>crab.</b> Approximately 8 % of the analysed <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> stomachs contained lumpsucker eggs in 2003. In 2005 and 2006, capelin eggs occurred in 10 % and 23 % of the analysed <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> stomachs and capelin in 82 % and 22 % respectively. As post-spawn capelin occurred more frequently in crab stomachs than capelin eggs, they might have served as alternative prey to capelin eggs. Average stomach evacuation time for lumpsucker in <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> was higher than for capelin eggs. Consumption estimates of capelin eggs in <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> accounted for 0. 04 % and 2. 23 % of the eggs available in the years of study, while the minimum estimated mortality due to egg cannibalism in capelin accounted for 1 - 2 % of the total egg production in 2003. The uncertainty in stomach data generated most of the uncertainty in the Monte Carlo estimated consumption of fish eggs by the <b>red</b> king <b>crab.</b> This study has established new knowledge about fish egg predation by the invasive red king and egg cannibalism in capelin. Mortality in capelin eggs caused by cannibalism and egg consumption by the <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> may influence mortality of eggs, but is not considered to hamper capelin recruitment. Recruitment of lumpsucker on the other hand, may be hampered by the <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> that chase away the egg guarding male, damage and feed on his eggs...|$|R
