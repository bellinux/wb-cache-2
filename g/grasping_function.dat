50|$|However, other {{researchers}} such as Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska argued {{a lack of}} functional comparison between eutriconodont teeth and those of marine mammals. Unlike the teeth of seals and cetaceans, eutriconodont molars occlude, creating a shearing motion like carnassials and unlike the <b>grasping</b> <b>function</b> of marine mammal molars. In her discussion of Astroconodon she brought up Ichthyoconodon and Dyskritodon as eutriconodonts found in aquatic deposits, but did not address their high status of preservation in a marine location, merely addressing Astroconodons freshwater occurrences.|$|E
50|$|Some eutriconodonts were instead {{among the}} most {{specialised}} of Mesozoic mammals. Several taxa like Astroconodon, Dyskritodon and Ichthyoconodon may show adaptations for piscivory and occur in aquatic settings with their molars being compared to those of seals and cetaceans. Caution has been advised in these comparisons, however; as many researchers like Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska have noted, eutriconodont molars are more functionally {{similar to those of}} terrestrial carnivorans than pinnipeds and cetaceans, occluding in a shearing motion instead of not-occluding and providing a <b>grasping</b> <b>function.</b> However, Dyskritodon and Ichthyoconodons teeth shows no erosion associated with aquatic transportation, meaning that the animals died in situ or close. Studies on Liaoconodon show that it has adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, possessing a barrel-like body and paddle-like limbs, and analysis of the postcrania of Yanoconodon shows adaptations towards multiple forms of locomotion, with traits in common with fossorial, arboreal, and semiaquatic mammals.|$|E

In particular, it can predict the final orientation of the part when it is grasped with a parallel-jaw gripper.

40|$|When {{grasping}} a {{part with}} a parallel-jaw gripper, the part will generally rotate due to kinematic constraints. Predicting the part's final orientation {{is useful for}} grasping and for planning sequences of gripper motions to orient parts. For a given part geometry, the <b>grasp</b> <b>function</b> maps initial orientations to final orientations. Previously, we studied polygonal and algebraic parts {{in the absence of}} friction. This paper considers how Coulomb friction affects the <b>grasp</b> <b>function.</b> We consider two models of Coulomb friction. For a deterministic model, we show that the <b>grasp</b> <b>function</b> of any polygonal part can be represented with a piecewise linear function that we call a step-ramp function. We then show that any step-ramp <b>function</b> is the <b>grasp</b> <b>function</b> of a curved part operating under zero friction. Both contain ranges of orientations where the part does not rotate when grasped. This yields our primary result, that any part with deterministic friction has equivalent grasp mechanics to a "du [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for paralleljaw grasping of isolated objects from depth images, under large gripper pose uncertainty. Whilst most approaches aim {{to predict the}} single best grasp pose from an image, our method first predicts a score for every possible grasp pose, which we denote the <b>grasp</b> <b>function.</b> With this, {{it is possible to}} achieve grasping robust to the gripper’s pose uncertainty, by smoothing the <b>grasp</b> <b>function</b> with the pose uncertainty function. Therefore, if the single best pose is adjacent to a region of poor grasp quality, that pose will no longer be chosen, and instead a pose will be chosen which is surrounded by a region of high grasp quality. To learn this function, we train a Convolutional Neural Network which takes as input a single depth image of an object, and outputs a score for each grasp pose across the image. Training data for this is generated by use of physics simulation and depth image simulation with 3 D object meshes, to enable acquisition of sufficient data without requiring exhaustive real-world experiments. We evaluate with both synthetic and real experiments, and show that the learned grasp score is more robust to gripper pose uncertainty than when this uncertainty is not accounted for...|$|R

40|$|In man {{and some}} of the apes, the thumb has the {{function}} of a contrafinger. This function is made possible by a great freedom of movement of the first metacarpal and a highly developed and differentiated thumb musculature. The <b>grasp</b> <b>function</b> of the hand is dependent on the oppositional capacity and adductive power of the thumb, and is severely limited by a paralysis or dysfunction of the intrinsic thumb muscles. Whereas loss of the function of the adductor pollicis can be partially compensated for by the adductive action of the extensor pollicis longus, in paralysis or dysfunction of the radial thenar muscles compensation can only be provided by surgery. Since 1918, many methods of tendon transfer have been described for the restoration of thumb opposition, all of which bring about an improvement of the <b>grasp</b> <b>function,</b> albeit to different degrees. These methods vary in the selection of the motor, the direction of pull of the tendon, the use of a fulcrum, and the mode of insertion. The highly effective method of Bunnell (1938) is often used as the standard procedure. With this method, the flexor superficialis tendon of the ring finger is looped around the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris and passed subcutaneously across the thenar eminence, after which it is fixed on the thumb {{at the level of the}} metacarpo-phalangeal joint. In the reconstruction of the thumb opposition, however, a standard procedure often cannot be applied, because the muscle-tendon unit usually used for this purpose has been damaged or because the transfer route is blocked by scar tissue...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} whether {{functional properties}} of the hand and tools influence the allocation of spatial attention. In four experiments that used a visual-orienting paradigm with predictable lateral cues, hands or tools were placed near potential target locations.

Validity effects were found regardless of condition in all experiments, but they did not interact with the target-in-grasping/raking-space bias. Thus, the topology of the facilitated space around the hand is, in part, defined by the hand’s <b>grasping</b> <b>function</b> and can be flexibly extended by functional experience using a tool.

40|$|To assist upper {{extremity}} amputees with achieving stable grasps of cylindrical tools, {{this article describes}} the development and testing of a prosthetic device for recreational kayak paddling. Initial development included participation of a non-amputee expert kayakist. Subsequent testing of the device used a pseudo-prosthesis for testing on a non-amputee subject, followed by qualitative feedback on the device from a unilateral transradial amputee. The device was evaluated by exploring whether subjects could independently don the terminal device, apply the paddle and use it in a pool and on a river. A semi-hinged, two hemi-cylinder sleeve was designed to be fitted onto a kayak paddle. The terminal device’s frame, a second (larger) semi-hinged two hemi-cylinder sleeve, attached the device to the prosthesis. This second sleeve had internal edges that prevent lateral shifting. This component allowed smooth paddle rotation while preventing lateral shift and maintaining grasp. The non-amputee subject was successful at donning the pseudo-prosthesis and paddling. Similarly, the amputee subject was also able to don the prosthesis and paddle using the device.

30|$|The {{specific}} instrument employed {{in our case}} was the rotating bipolar grasping forceps (RoBi). It is an ideal tool in laparoscopy for grasping and dissecting due to its special joint coupling [12]. In contrast to the traditional Kleppinger bipolar forceps, {{the presence of the}} specific articulation joint at the fulcrum of the two active jaws (Fig.  3) allows not just <b>grasping</b> <b>function,</b> but also precise dissection. The jaws of the RoBi can be opened by the surgeon, unlike the Kleppinger which relies on a passive motion, and thus, the surgeon is able to determine the force to be exerted on the handle which is in turn transferred to the tissue. This feature has allowed the RoBi to be an excellent tool in many laparoscopic procedures. One major setback in the design is presence of the non-insulated joints, which can lead to indirect thermal injury as in our case. Precaution must be taken when using this instrument to ensure that there is no critical viscera in contact with the actively charged joints when the bipolar pedal is activated.|$|E

This requirement can be limiting {{when a person}} is engaged in a task, or prohibitive for some people suffering from neuromuscular disorders. Determining a person's intent, e. g., where and when to move, from brain signals rather than from muscles would have important applications in clinical or other domains.

40|$|This paper digs {{into the}} {{relationship}} between cages and grasps of a rigid body. In particular, it considers the use of cages as waypoints to grasp an object. We introduce the concept of pregrasping cages, caging configurations from which an object can be grasped without first breaking the cage. For two-fingered manipulators, all cages are pregrasping cages and, consequently, useful waypoints to grasp an object. A contribution {{of this paper is}} to show that the same does not hold for more than two fingers. A second contribution is to show how to overcome that limitation. We explore the natural generalization of the well understood squeezing/stretching characterization of two-finger cages to arbitrary workspace dimension, arbitrary object shapes without holes, and arbitrary number of point fingers, and exploit it to give sufficient conditions for a cage to be a pregrasping cage. As a product of that generalization, we introduce <b>grasping</b> functions: Scalar <b>functions</b> defined on the finger formation that control the process of going from a cage to a grasp. We finish the paper by establishing an analogy between the role of <b>grasping</b> <b>functions</b> in <b>grasping</b> and that of Lyapunov functions in stability theory. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{children}} with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP), impairment of upper extremity (UE) both in strenght and motor control represents {{an obstacle to}} exploration, self-care, activities of daily living, represents a main target of several treatment approaches. Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) is a promising approach, but its efficacy is still object of a debate. Aim {{of this study is}} to measure the effect of CIMT on patients with hemiplegic CP after the end of 10 -weeks intensive treatment practice. DESIGN: Designed as a multi center, prospective, cluster-randomized controlled clinical trial. CIMT is compared with ah Intensive Rehabilitation Program (IRP) of bimanual training. Primary outcome measures concern UE motor ability (QUEST) and assessment of affected hand's function in spontaneous use (Besta Scale). Secondary outcome measures concern overall function, behavior, stress, compliance and satisfaction with treatment program of both child and family. RESULTS: 105 patients were recruited (treatment groups CIMT (n= 39), bimanual IRP (n= 33) and Standard Treatment (n= 33)). Statistically significant changes are observed in the global score before and after treatment of the 2 groups (CIMT and IRP group) of children assessed with the Besta Scales (CIMT p= 0. 002; IRP p< 0. 0001, and QUEST (CIMT p< 0. 0001; IRP p= 0. 0143). In CIMT group the higher improvement is observed in <b>grasp</b> <b>function</b> (p= 0. 0019). In IRP group, the improvement is more significant in activities of spontaneous use (p= 0. 0005) and ADL in the younger (p= 0. 0001).
