40|$|Comparison of {{the energy}} to noise ratio {{necessary}} to obtain a given modulation bit error probability has indicated that three-phase modulation is about 0. 75 db superior to four-phase. It is shown that this apparent superiority results entirely from the greater bandwidth required by the three-phase system for the same bit transmission rate. Two further comparison criteria are proposed, {{which are based on}} the cut-off rate R sub 0 of the discrete channel created by the modulation system. For the criterion which constrains both the bandwidth and transmitted power, it is shown that <b>four-phase</b> <b>modulation</b> is always superior to three-phase modulation. The conclusion is that three-phase modulation offers no practical advantage over <b>four-phase</b> <b>modulation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an active {{solution to a}} common-mode voltage created by typical three-phase inverters. It is shown that {{the addition of a}} fourth leg to the bridge of a three-phase inverter eliminates the common-mode voltage to ground created by the modulation of the inverter. An appropriate four-phase LC filter is inserted between the inverter and the load in order to create sinusoidal output line-to-line voltage. A simple modification of the modulation strategy is implemented for the four-phase inverter to achieve a three-phase wye-output neutral-to-ground voltage which is equal to zero at all times for an ideal inverter. The modulation strategy thereby completely eliminates the common-mode potential produced by traditional modulation techniques with traditional three-phase inverter topologies.
