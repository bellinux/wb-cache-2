5|$|John {{initially}} {{adopted a}} defensive posture {{similar to that}} of 1199: avoiding open battle and carefully defending his key castles. John's operations became more chaotic as the campaign progressed, and Philip began to make steady progress in the east. John became aware in July that Arthur's forces were threatening his mother, Eleanor, at Mirebeau Castle. Accompanied by William de Roches, his seneschal in Anjou, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> mercenary army rapidly south to protect her. His forces caught Arthur by surprise and captured the entire rebel leadership at the battle of Mirebeau. With his southern flank weakening, Philip was forced to withdraw in the east and turn south himself to contain John's army.|$|E
5|$|Sherman {{settled into}} a siege of Atlanta, {{shelling}} the city and sending raids west {{and south of the}} city to cut off the supply lines from Macon, Georgia. Both of Sherman's cavalry raids were defeated by superior southern horsemen. Following the failure to break the Confederates' hold on the city, Sherman began to employ a new strategy. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> entire army in a broad flanking maneuver to the west. Finally, on August 31, at Jonesborough, Georgia, Sherman's army captured the railroad track from Macon, pushing the Confederates to Lovejoy's Station. With his supply lines fully severed, Hood pulled his troops out of Atlanta the next day, September 1, destroying supply depots as he left to prevent them from falling into Union hands. He also set fire to eighty-one loaded ammunition cars, which led to a conflagration watched by hundreds.|$|E
25|$|After Prenzlau, Blücher's {{escape path}} to the {{northeast}} was blocked. At Neustrelitz <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> columns to the northwest and raced toward Lübeck. By this time, Winning's division joined him to raise his total strength to 22,000 men. The Battle of Lübeck occurred on 6 November.|$|E
6000|$|The Driver 'e give nothin' 'cept {{a little}} coughin' grunt, But <b>'e</b> <b>swung</b> <b>'is</b> 'orses 'andsome {{when it came}} to [...] "Action Front!" [...] An' if one wheel was juicy, you may lay your Monday head 'Twas juicier for the niggers when the case begun to spread.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>swung</b> round <b>his</b> little wallet as he spoke, {{and held}} it up to view.|$|R
60|$|On that <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> on <b>his</b> heel, {{and strode}} {{out of the}} stockade, his negroes following.|$|R
25|$|An {{opponent}} of the British Empire, Hearst opposed American involvement in the First World War and attacked {{the formation of the}} League of Nations. His newspapers abstained from endorsing any candidate in 1920 and 1924. Hearst's last bid for office came in 1922 when he was backed by Tammany Hall leaders for the U.S. Senate nomination in New York. Al Smith vetoed this, earning the lasting enmity of Hearst. Although Hearst shared Smith's opposition to Prohibition, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> papers behind Herbert Hoover in the 1928 presidential election. Hearst's support for Franklin D. Roosevelt at the 1932 Democratic National Convention, via his allies William Gibbs McAdoo and John Nance Garner, can also be seen as part of his vendetta against Smith, who was an {{opponent of}} Roosevelt's at that convention.|$|E
25|$|On the January 4, 2010, live-three-hour, Monday night {{edition of}} Impact! Sting {{returned}} to the Impact! Zone appearing in the rafters of the arena. Sting reappeared two months later on March 8, appearing as {{he was going to}} help a bloodied Hulk Hogan and Abyss during a match {{at the beginning of the}} show against A.J. Styles and Ric Flair. Instead <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> baseball bat on Hogan and Abyss, turning heel as a result. He was later defeated by the debuting Rob Van Dam. Sting would continuously attack Van Dam with his bat after the match, completing his heel turn by attacking security guards and Hulk Hogan. On the March 22 edition of Impact! Sting was announced as the captain of Team Flair in the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would meet Team Hogan, captained by Abyss. At Lockdown Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) were defeated by Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy). On May 3, Sting explained his actions to Hogan and was later attacked from behind by Jeff Jarrett. At Sacrifice Sting assaulted Jarrett prior to their match and then dragged him in to the ring, where he managed to score a pinfall in seconds over his bloodied opponent, leaving him injured. On the following edition of Impact! the TNA Championship Committee ranked Sting number one in the rankings and as a result he was granted a shot at Rob Van Dam's World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary VIII. Sting then attacked Eric Bischoff with his baseball bat, biting the hand that fed him. Sting later promised that he would reveal the motives behind his actions after winning the World Heavyweight Championship. At Slammiversary VIII Jeff Jarrett made his return and cost Sting his title match against Rob Van Dam.|$|E
2500|$|I saw Quick betray {{only one}} sign of emotion. As <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> clumsy flag to and fro, an end of it once caught on a cactus pillar, and he looked sharply over his {{shoulder}} to see what had it. He gave the flag an impatient jerk. He looked annoyed." ...|$|E
60|$|As <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> on <b>his</b> heel to go on, a tramp, {{going in}} the same direction, begged him over his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Brooke said nothing, but he {{felt that}} he had had a warning as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> off <b>his</b> big shapeless hat and turned away.|$|R
60|$|Macdougal {{was already}} at the door, between the two detectives. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> around. <b>His</b> voice was calm, almost clear--calm with the {{concentration}} of hatred.|$|R
2500|$|Rosenthal piled {{stones and}} a sandbag {{so he had}} {{something}} on which to stand, as he was only 5 feet and 5inches (1.65m) tall. He set his camera for a lens setting between f/8 and f/11 and the shutter speed at 1/400th second. Then, {{out of the corner}} of his eye, he saw six Marines start to raise the second flag. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> camera around toward the action and pushed the shutter. Three feet to his right, Sgt. Genaust captured the flag-raising from nearly the same angle using color motion picture film. To make sure he had a worthwhile photo to send to the AP, Rosenthal took another black and white photograph showing four of the second flag-raisers steadying the flagstaff waiting for the bottom of the pipe to be more secured with rocks; and afterwards a rope. When that was done, Rosenthal gathered a group of sixteen Marines and two Navy corpsmen around the base of the flagstaff for a posed shot (called the [...] "Gung Ho" [...] photo) which included First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, the only officer on the summit, who had volunteered to take the 40-man patrol up Mount Suribachi that morning to seize and occupy the crest and raise the battalion's flag.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> stick restlessly, {{and seemed}} fitfully talking to himself.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> paddle and {{the canoe}} drove faster toward a rapid.|$|E
60|$|Slowly and stiffly the rustler {{rose to his}} feet. When {{he reached}} <b>his</b> height <b>he</b> {{deliberately}} <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> leg to kick Belllounds in the face.|$|R
60|$|Obediently <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> {{down from}} <b>his</b> horse, and {{surrendered}} the reins to her.|$|R
6000|$|... "D--n you, Burke, what do I {{care for}} the fellow? If you want the man's life, take it!" [...] and I knew that <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> upon <b>his</b> heel and walked away.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> axe again, and Gordon, who saw Waynefleet approaching, strolled away {{towards the}} ranch-owner.|$|E
6000|$|The {{expression}} of Caleb's face was visibly softening while Fred spoke. But <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> {{head with a}} solemn slowness, and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|Once in the alley, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> {{revolver}} to a handy spot on {{his thigh}} {{and entered the}} saloon abruptly from the rear.|$|E
60|$|Again <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> up <b>his</b> {{chair and}} dashed {{it at the}} window, and yet again, until no window remained, but a great, gaping opening with a fringe of ragged glass and twisted leadwork.|$|R
60|$|Alton had the beast's head up {{the trail}} now, but as he sent <b>his</b> heels home <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> up <b>his</b> right hand, and the girl smiled down on him bravely out of misty eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{slapped the}} horse affectionately, and, turning to his own, <b>he</b> stepped and <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> long length up.|$|R
6000|$|... "Get {{out of my}} way," [...] {{said the}} rancher, in the disgust of intense irritation. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> arm, and his open hand sent Hare reeling against the counter.|$|E
60|$|It must be {{confessed that}} Sam felt a trifle nervous, so anxious {{was he to}} {{make some sort of}} a showing. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> ashen stick at the first ball pitched.|$|E
60|$|Duroc's {{patience}} {{could stand}} no more. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> open {{hand into the}} centre of the great orange beard. I saw a lip fringed with blood, and two glaring blue eyes above it.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>swung</b> off <b>his</b> straw hat, {{and held}} it at his knee as he raised a hand to her, and though his {{deference}} was, perhaps, a trifle overdone, it was redeemed by its genuineness, and did not displease her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Worthington; [...] "I'll be in at {{two o'clock}} on Thursday." [...] And then, without another word to either of them, <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> on <b>his</b> heel and strode quickly out of the store. Jethro did not move.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> out <b>his</b> {{rifle and}} waved {{for the driver}} to stop. But he did not stop. Kurt heard a scream. He saw a white face. He saw the driver swing his hand across that white face, dashing it back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Landed by torchlight," [...] uttered {{precisely}} {{the shade of}} Captain Jorgenson, late of the Barque Wild Rose. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> arm pointing across the lagoon and Mrs. Travers turned about in that direction.|$|E
60|$|A tall man, {{in a rough}} coat, with grizzled {{hair and}} beard under an old fur cap, came slowly down the steps, {{whistling}} softly to himself, as <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> lantern to and fro.|$|E
60|$|Saying this, Babalatchi stepped {{carelessly}} forward, {{putting his}} foot as if accidentally {{on the hand}} of the corpse and pressing it into the soft mud. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> staff menacingly towards the crowd, which fell back a little.|$|E
60|$|Denton {{glanced at}} her and stood downcast. Then <b>he</b> <b>swung</b> round on <b>his</b> heel and {{walked up and down}} very rapidly.|$|R
60|$|But Morel's {{blood was}} up. <b>He</b> <b>swung</b> round on <b>his</b> son. William was bigger, but Morel was hard-muscled, and mad with fury.|$|R
60|$|Challenger was too furious to speak. <b>He</b> simply <b>swung</b> <b>his</b> pack {{upon his}} back and {{continued}} upon his march. Lord John came abreast of me, however, {{and his face was}} more grave than was his wont. He had his Zeiss glasses in his hand.|$|R
