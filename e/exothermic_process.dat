5|$|The {{fusion of}} two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an <b>exothermic</b> <b>process</b> that {{releases}} {{more energy than}} is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an endothermic process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.|$|E
25|$|As the {{temperature}} increases, an amorphous solid will become less viscous. At {{some point the}} molecules may obtain enough freedom of motion to spontaneously arrange themselves into a crystalline form. This {{is known as the}} crystallization temperature (Tc). This transition from amorphous solid to crystalline solid is an <b>exothermic</b> <b>process,</b> and results in a peak in the DSC signal. As {{the temperature}} increases the sample eventually reaches its melting temperature (Tm). The melting process results in an endothermic peak in the DSC curve. The ability to determine transition temperatures and enthalpies makes DSC a valuable tool in producing phase diagrams for various chemical systems.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC) is {{an analytical}} technique {{used to examine}} thermodynamic properties of molecules. It can study the thermal behavior of materials as they undergo physical and chemical changes during heat treatment. The parameters that are measured {{are referred to as}} the glass transition value (Tg) and melting temperature (Tm). These values are measured over time and are comparable between an inert reference sample and the analyte. Changes in the (Tm) and (Tg) values evaluate phase changes (solid, liquid-gel, liquid, etc.) in which an endothermic or <b>exothermic</b> <b>process</b> occurs. This technique is useful for monitoring the phase changes in phospholipids by providing information such as the amount of heat released or absorbed and time for phase transitions to occur, etc. DSC monitoring can occur at slow rates which is a disadvantage in monitoring fast phase transitions within phospholipids.|$|E

Excessive heat and process contaminants {{have the potential to}} cause acute health effects such as heat stroke, and chronic effects such as mangan-ism in welders. Although millions of workers are exposed to <b>exothermic</b> <b>processes,</b> insufficient attention has been given to continuously improving engineering technologies for these processes to provide effective and efficient control. Currently there is no specific occupational standard established by OSHA regarding exposure to heat from <b>exothermic</b> <b>processes,</b> therefore it is important to investigate techniques that canmitigate known and potential adverse occupational health effects. The current understanding of engineering controls for <b>exothermic</b> <b>processes</b> is primarily based on a book chapter written by W. C. L. Hemeon in 1955. Improvements in heat transfer and meteorological theory necessary to design improved process controls have occurred since this time.

2500|$|It takes {{considerable}} {{energy to}} force nuclei to fuse, {{even those of}} the lightest element, hydrogen. When accelerated to high enough speeds, nuclei can overcome this electrostatic repulsion and brought close enough such that the attractive nuclear force {{is greater than the}} repulsive Coulomb force. The strong force grows rapidly once the nuclei are close enough, and the fusing nucleons can essentially [...] "fall" [...] into each other and result is fusion and net energy produced. The fusion of lighter nuclei, which creates a heavier nucleus and often a free neutron or proton, generally releases more energy than it takes to force the nuclei together; this is an <b>exothermic</b> <b>process</b> that can produce self-sustaining reactions.|$|E
2500|$|A fusion {{process that}} {{produces}} a nucleus lighter than iron-56 or nickel-62 will generally yield a net energy release. These elements have the smallest mass per nucleon and the largest binding energy per nucleon, respectively. Fusion of light elements toward these releases energy (an <b>exothermic</b> <b>process),</b> while a fusion producing nuclei heavier than these elements, will result in energy retained by the resulting nucleons, and the resulting reaction is endothermic. The opposite {{is true for the}} reverse process, nuclear fission. This means that the lighter elements, such as hydrogen and helium, are in general more fusible; while the heavier elements, such as uranium and plutonium, are more fissionable. The extreme astrophysical event of a supernova can produce enough energy to fuse nuclei into elements heavier than iron.|$|E
2500|$|The chart shows {{solubility}} curves {{for some}} typical solid inorganic salts (temperature is in degrees Celsius i.e. kelvins minus 273). Many salts behave like barium nitrate and disodium hydrogen arsenate, and show a large increase in solubility with temperature. Some solutes (e.g., sodium chloride in water) exhibit solubility that is fairly independent of temperature. A few, such as calcium sulfate (gypsum) and cerium(III) sulfate, become less {{soluble in water}} as temperature increases. This {{is also the case}} of calcium hydroxide (portlandite) whose solubility at 70°C is about half of its value at 25°C. The dissolution of calcium hydroxide in water is also an <b>exothermic</b> <b>process</b> and obeys to the Le Chatelier's principle. A lowering of temperature will thus favour the dissolution heat elimination and increases the equilibrium constant of dissolution of Ca(OH)2, and so increase its solubility at low temperature. This temperature dependence is sometimes referred to as [...] "retrograde" [...] or [...] "inverse" [...] solubility. Occasionally, a more complex pattern is observed, as with sodium sulfate, where the less soluble decahydrate crystal loses water of crystallization at 32°C to form a more soluble anhydrous phase.|$|E
