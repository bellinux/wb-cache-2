5|$|The call of {{the great}} spotted {{woodpecker}} is a sharp kik, which may be repeated as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the bird is disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> flight. The great spotted woodpecker drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.|$|E
5|$|For BABS, {{the only}} change was {{to change the}} broadcast's {{transmissions}} {{to a series of}} short pulses rather than a continuous signal. These pulses were sent out when triggered by the AI radar's signals and were powerful enough that they could be picked up by the Mk. IV receiver within a few miles. On reception, the Mk. IV would receive either the dots or dashes, and the operator would see an alternating series of blips centred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>display,</b> popping out and then disappearing as the BABS antennas switched. The duration of the blip indicated whether the aircraft was to the left or right, and became a continuous blip on the centreline. This technique was known as AI beam approach (AIBA).|$|E

5|$|The twin pylons rise to {{a height}} 30metres above the memorial's stone platform; one bears the maple leaf for Canada and the other the fleur-de-lis for France, and both symbolize the unity and {{sacrifice}} of the two countries. At {{the top of the}} pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the Chorus. The most senior figures represent Justice and Peace; Peace stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. The pair is in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of Truth and Justice, located outside the Supreme Court of Canada in Ottawa. The remainder of the Chorus is located directly below the senior figures: Faith, Hope and Truth on the eastern pylon; and Honour, Charity and Knowledge on the western pylon. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada's war dead in both French and English are located {{at the base of the}} pylons. The Spirit of Sacrifice is located at the base between the two pylons. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>display,</b> a young dying soldier is gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. In a lightly veiled reference to the poem In Flanders Fields by John McCrae, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.|$|E

25|$|The Wang LOCI-2 Logarithmic Computing Instrument desktop {{calculator}} (the earlier LOCI-1 in September 1964 {{was not a}} real product) {{was introduced}} in January 1965.

The electronics included 1,275 discrete transistors. It actually performed multiplication by adding logarithms, and roundoff <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> conversion was noticeable: 2 times 2 yielded 3.999999999.|$|E
25|$|The Norden {{operated}} by mechanically turning the viewpoint so the target remained stationary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>display.</b> The mechanism {{was designed for}} the low angular rate encountered at high altitudes, and thus had a relatively low range of operational speeds. The Norden could not rotate the sight fast enough for bombing at low altitude, for instance. Typically this was solved by removing the Norden completely {{and replacing it with}} simpler sighting systems.|$|E

The building is split into two main rooms - in one half {{the interior of the}} lamp cabin is recreated, with a collection of lamps on shelves, and the system of safety tokens used to track which miners were underground. Included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> is a 1927 Hailwood and Ackroyd lamp cleaning machine sourced from Morrison Busty Colliery in Annfield Plain. In the second room is an educational display (i.e. not a period interior).|$|E
25|$|Several {{cases have}} {{wrestled}} {{with the concept of}} initial interest confusion. In Brookfield Commc'ns v. West Coast Ent'mt the court found initial interest confusion could occur when a competitor's trademarked terms were used in the HTML metatags of a website, resulting in that site appearing in the search results when a user searches on the trademarked term. In Playboy v. Netscape, the court found initial interest confusion when users typed in Playboy's trademarks into a search engine, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>display</b> of search results alongside unlabeled banner ads, triggered by keywords that included Playboy's marks, that would take users to Playboy's competitors. Though users might ultimately realize upon clicking on the banner ads that they were not Playboy-affiliated, the court found that the competitor advertisers could have gained customers by appropriating Playboy's goodwill since users may be perfectly happy to browse the competitor's site instead of returning to the search results to find the Playboy sites.|$|E
