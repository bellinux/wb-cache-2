5|$|It {{was written}} in the L.A. sun on an {{afternoon}} with my friend David Poe. We were talking about how you sometimes know that you would be better at love <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>you</b> were older. But you can't rush old. You have to be young and dumb and let time do its thing before you get the experience you need to handle love right.|$|E

500|$|Olga {{tried to}} draw comfort from her faith and her {{proximity}} to her family. To her [...] "beloved mama", {{with whom she}} had sometimes had a difficult relationship, she wrote a poem in April 1917, while the family was still imprisoned at Tsarskoye Selo: [...] "You are filled with anguish for the sufferings of others. And no one's grief has ever passed you by. You are relentless, only towards yourself, forever cold and pitiless. But <b>if</b> <b>only</b> <b>you</b> could look upon your own sadness from a distance, just once with a loving soul — Oh, how you would pity yourself, how sadly you would weep." [...] In another letter from Tobolsk, Olga wrote: [...] "Father asks to… remember that the evil which is now in the world will become yet more powerful, and that it is not evil which conquers evil, but only love …" ...|$|E

500|$|Game Informers Andrew Reiner {{cited the}} example of coin {{redistribution}} in the game, which meant that [...] "You could win every minigame and collect the most coins but still end up in last place", when giving a second opinion of the game. While acknowledging issues relating to the waiting times during board games, IGN's Peer Schneider praised this installment for relieving the problem slightly, specifically referring to the Mini Bowsers, who all take their turns {{at the same time}} in [...] "Story" [...] mode. The quantity and accessibility of the minigames was lauded by GameSpot, although the reviewer Ryan Davis proceeded to note [...] "If you bought Mario Party 4 last year, Mario Party 5 is hard to recommend.", noting a lack of change to the series formula. Generally, critics cited having a fun experience in Mario Party 5, although the minigames received a more enthusiastic reaction than the actual board game, with GameSpy commenting that [...] "the sheer volume can keep you compelled. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>you</b> didn't have to deal with all that BS in-between" [...] when referring to gameplay of the actual board game.|$|E

2500|$|Mark Huxley at Barnes & Noble gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} album, saying that Rimes is [...] "comfortably adopting some distinctly modern sonic elements without sacrificing her tradition-steeped country roots." [...] Alanna Nash of Entertainment Weekly gave a mixed review about the album, saying [...] "The good news about Rimes' latest: It reprises two songs, 'But I Do Love You' and 'Can't Fight the Moonlight,' from the Coyote Ugly soundtrack. Now the bad: You'll snooze through the rest, except 'Written in the Stars', her slugfest duet with Elton John. <b>If</b> <b>only</b> <b>you</b> could sleep through that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The sharper {{students}} of the current generation reasonably regard the [...] "New Archaeology" [...] in its pristine form as a period piece, as strange an artefact of that remote era as the Paris évènements or Woodstock.

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of this success, many emo bands were signed to major record labels and the genre became marketable. According to Dreamworks Records senior A {{representative}} Luke Wood, [...] "The industry really does look at emo as the new raprock, or the new grunge. I don't think that anyone is listening to the music that's being made—they're thinking of how they're going {{to take advantage of}} the sound's popularity at retail." [...] Emo's apolitical nature, catchy music and accessible themes had a broad appeal for the young, mainstream audience. Taking Back Sunday had continued success in the next few years, with their 2004 album Where You Want To Be reaching number three on the Billboard 200. The album's second single, [...] "This Photograph is Proof (I Know You Know)", appeared on the Spider-Man 2 soundtrack. The band's 2006 album, Louder Now, reached number two on the Billboard 200. Both albums were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America; Where You Want To Be sold 667,000 copies by September 2005, and Louder Now sold over 900,000 copies by June 9, 2008. The All-American Rejects' self-titled album was certified platinum by the RIAA; [...] "Swing, Swing", a track from the album, reached number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100. Their album Move Along was certified double platinum by the RIAA; its single, [...] "Dirty Little Secret", reached number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 and was certified platinum by the RIAA. Canadian emo band Simple Plan's 2002 album, No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls was certified double platinum by the RIAA and Music Canada; their 2004 album, Still Not Getting Any..., was certified platinum by the RIAA and quadruple platinum by Music Canada. Hawthorne Heights' 2004 album, The Silence in Black and White, sold 929,000 copies in the United States.
