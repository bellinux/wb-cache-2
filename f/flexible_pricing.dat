5|$|While American economists quickly {{abandoned}} disequilibrium models, European economists {{were more}} open to models without market clearing. Europeans such as Edmond Malinvaud and Jacques Drèze expanded on the disequilibrium tradition and worked to explain price rigidity instead of simply assuming it. Malinvaud (1977) used disequilibrium analysis to develop a theory of unemployment. He argued that disequilibrium in the labor and goods markets could lead to rationing of goods and labor, leading to unemployment. Malinvaud adopted a fixprice framework and argued that pricing would be rigid in modern, industrial prices compared to the relatively <b>flexible</b> <b>pricing</b> systems of raw goods that dominate agricultural economies. Prices are fixed and only quantities adjust. Malinvaud considers an equilibrium state in classical and Keynesian unemployment as most likely. Work in the neoclassical tradition is confined as a special case of Malinvaud's typology, the Walrasian equilibrium. In Malinvaud's theory, reaching the Walrasian equilibrium case {{is almost impossible to}} achieve given the nature of industrial pricing.|$|E

Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage {{through the construction of}} roads subsidised by the taxpayer, while restricting the rail industry's ability to use <b>flexible</b> <b>pricing</b> because it was held to nationally agreed rate cards. The government response was to commission several inconclusive reports; the Salter Report of 1933 finally recommended that road transport should be taxed directly to fund the roads and increased Vehicle Excise Duty and fuel duties were introduced. It also noted that many small lines would never be likely to compete with road haulage. Although these road pricing changes helped their survival, the railways entered a period of slow decline, owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles.|$|E

40|$|Multi-sector sticky price {{models have}} {{surprising}} implications when durable goods have <b>flexible</b> <b>prices.</b> While in actual data {{the production of}} virtually all durables exhibits strong negative responses to monetary contractions, in dynamic general equilibrium models a monetary contraction causes the output of flexibly priced durables to expand.

40|$|In {{models with}} {{complete}} markets, targeting core inflation enables monetary policy to maximize welfare by replicating the <b>flexible</b> <b>price</b> equilibrium. In this paper, we develop a twosector two-good closed economy new Keynesian model {{to study the}} optimal choice of price index in markets with financial frictions. Financial frictions that limit credit-constrained consumers' access to financial markets make demand insensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The demand of credit-constrained consumers is determined by their real wage, which depends on <b>prices</b> in the <b>flexible</b> <b>price</b> sector.

Our analysis suggests that in the presence of financial frictions a welfaremaximizing central bank should adopt flexible headline inflation targeting - a target based on headline rather than core inflation, and with some weight on the output gap. We discuss why these results are particularly relevant for emerging markets, where the share of food expenditures in total consumption expenditures is high and a large proportion of consumers are credit-constrained...|$|R

40|$|There is {{no single}} model that will serve best for all central bank purposes. NEMO (Norwegian Economy Model) is a core model {{supported}} by surrounding satellite models which serve certain tasks. Since Norges Bank is an inflation targeting central bank, expectations and the lags with which the monetary policy affects the economy should be paid particular attention, Norges Bank (2006). This is reflected in NEMO, which is a modern DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) model, based on the International Monetary Fund’s multicountry Global Economic Model (GEM). NEMO is a smaller and simpler model than the GEM, but also modified to better fit the Norwegian economy. NEMO is a two country model, microeconomic founded and builds on the New Keynesian framework, cf. Norges Bank (2006). The purpose of this thesis {{is to develop a}} <b>flexible</b> <b>prices</b> version of NEMO. This is a completely theoretical thesis and it will not give any empirical results. There are various reasons for why we should care about a <b>flexible</b> <b>price</b> solution of NEMO. The thesis focuses on the natural level of production. Woodford (2003) argues that <b>flexible</b> <b>price</b> models should serve as a benchmark for measuring the natural rate of output and the output gap. "The level of output that would occur in an equilibrium with <b>flexible</b> <b>prices,</b> given current real factors (tastes, technology, government purchases) -what is called the "natural rate" of output, following Friedman (1968) -turns out to be a highly useful concept [...] . " Woodford (2003, pp. 8). Woodford mentions further that Wicksell (1898) discusses "the natural rate of interest", which is the real rate of interest that would be realized in an equilibrium with <b>flexible</b> <b>prices.</b> "Natural" levels of macroeconomic variables are of highly importance for central banks. Natural level of production and the output gap, which is defined as the gap between the natural level of production and actual production, are both of high importance in monetary theory, Walsh (2003). The output gap is an indicator for economic pressure and also enters in a central bank’s loss function. The DSGE framework opens for calculations of the natural levels, according to Woodfords definition. This relates the natural level of production to the real shocks in the economy. This will give us a more volatile natural level of output in proportion to other ways of extracting natural levels of production e. g. Hodrick-Prescott filtering. On the other hand, as Neiss, K. S. and Nelson, E. (2005) state, the output gap is no longer a measure of the business cycle. The outputgap is solely related to the nominal rigidities. In addition to the removal of nominal rigidities, the <b>flexible</b> <b>price</b> model is modified from local currency pricing in NEMO, to producer currency pricing. This is done because it is assumed that domestic households are better off in a model where domestic <b>prices</b> are <b>flexible</b> and <b>prices</b> abroad are sticky, than in a model where all <b>prices</b> are <b>flexible.</b> This assumption is debatable. It is not clear whether prices abroad should be flexible or not. As long as <b>flexible</b> home <b>prices</b> and sticky prices abroad are assumed, then producer currency pricing is needed to avoid monetary policy to {{have an effect on the}} real economy. The <b>flexible</b> <b>price</b> model of NEMO which is developed in this thesis consists of a system of 47 non linear equations and 47 endogenous variables. This include 16 shock processes, where 5 shocks are due to the exogenous foreign country, 4 shocks are preference shocks, 4 are markup shocks, 2 are technology shocks and 1 is public spending shock...|$|R
