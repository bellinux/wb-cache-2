500|$|Cotto's next {{scheduled}} {{match was}} against the then-undefeated Paul Malignaggi in a fight that took place on June 10, 2006 in Madison Square Garden. Cotto opened a cut over Malignaggi's right eye in the first round, which, according to Malignaggi, affected his performance {{over the course of}} the fight, by stating [...] "this was the first time in which I was cut, and the blood kept going into my eye. And <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> the entire fight. I was not able to see very well. Cotto's a great fighter, but I'm disappointed, as I wanted to be the champion". Cotto won the fight by unanimous decision with scores of 116-111 and 115-112. Malignaggi suffered a fractured right orbital bone and his jaw was injured, he was taken to Roosevelt Hospital after the fight's outcome was announced.|$|E
500|$|The burning {{aeroplane}} in the book's opening, and the suspicions {{it immediately}} arouses, quickly introduces {{the problems of}} terrorism and international security. The day's political demonstration and the ubiquity of its news coverage provide background noise to Perowne's day, leading to him to ponder his relationship with these events. Christopher Hitchens {{pointed out that the}} novel is set on the [...] "actual day the whole of bien-pensant Britain moved into the streets to jeer at George Bush and Tony Blair" [...] and placed the novel as [...] "unapologetically anchored {{as it is in the}} material world and its several discontents". The Economist newspaper set the context as a [...] "world where terrorism and war make headlines, but also filter into the smallest corners of people's lives." [...] McEwan said himself, [...] "The march gathered not far from my house, and <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> that so many people seemed so thrilled to be there". The characterisation of Perowne as an intelligent, self-aware man: [...] "..a habitual observer of his own moods' [...] is given to reveries about his mental processes," [...] allows the author to explicitly set out this theme.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Michigan, Bump {{turned down an}} offer to play {{professional}} football for the Detroit Lions, saying {{he said he had}} obtained a job in Chicago outside of football. [...] Elliott also considered going into medicine as his father had done, but he chose instead to go into coaching. [...] He started his coaching career at Michigan in the fall of 1948 as assistant backfield coach. [...] In the spring of 1949, he was hired as an assistant coach under Kip Taylor at Oregon State, where he remained for three seasons, from 1949–1951. [...] Elliott later recalled, [...] "I was only 24 when Kip Taylor hired me as backfield coach at Oregon State, and <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> a little because there were two backs on the squad who were older than I was." [...] It was even worse for his brother Pete, who was 22 when he was hired to coach the ends. [...] Bump recalled: [...] "After practice one night some players noticed Pete light up a cigaret. [...] One of his ends drew Pete aside and said in a fatherly voice, 'You shouldn't smoke, coach; I didn't do it when I was your age." [...] Oregon State had an overall record of 14–15 in Elliott's three years as an assistant coach.|$|E

2500|$|With accompaniment by {{experimental}} rock guitarist Gary Lucas, Buckley performed [...] "I Never Asked To Be Your Mountain", a song Tim Buckley {{wrote about}} an infant Jeff Buckley and his mother. Buckley {{returned to the}} stage to play [...] "Sefronia– The King's Chain", [...] "Phantasmagoria in Two", and concluded the concert with [...] "Once I Was" [...] performed acoustically with an impromptu a cappella ending, due to a snapped guitar string. Willner, the show's organizer, later recalled that Buckley's set closer made a strong impression. Buckley's performance at the concert was counter-intuitive to his desire to distance himself musically from his father. Buckley later explained his reasoning to Rolling Stone: [...] "It wasn't my work, it wasn't my life. But <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> that I hadn't been to his funeral, that I'd {{never been able to}} tell him anything. I used that show to pay my last respects." [...] The concert proved to be his first step into the music industry that had eluded him for years.|$|E

60|$|There was {{something}} wrong about that shark. <b>It</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me.</b> It {{had no right to}} be there in that deserted ocean. The more I thought about it, the more incomprehensible it became. But two hours later we sighted land and the mystery was cleared up. He had come to us from the land, and not from the uninhabited deep. He had presaged the landfall. He was the messenger of the land.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have got}} a general, sure enough," [...] he cried. [...] "He talks to them plainly, does he, so that they understand? I say to you, Brice," [...] he went on earnestly, [...] "the {{importance}} of plain talk can't be overestimated. Any thought, however abstruse, can be put in speech that {{a boy or a}} negro can grasp. Any book, however deep, can be written in terms that everybody can comprehend, if a man only tries hard enough. When I was a boy I used to hear the neighbors talking, and <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> so because I could not understand them that I used to sit up half the night thinking things out for myself. I remember that I did not know what the word demonstrate meant. So I stopped my studies then and there and got a volume of Euclid. Before I got through I could demonstrate everything in it, and I have never been bothered with demonstrate since." ...|$|E
60|$|There was {{something}} I {{wanted to do}} before leaving, {{but it was a}} disagreeable matter, and I hated to go at it. Well, <b>it</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> all the morning. I could have mentioned it to the old king, but what would be the use?--he was but an extinct volcano; he had been active in his time, but his fire was out, this good while, he was only a stately ash-pile now; gentle enough, and kindly enough for my purpose, without doubt, but not usable. He was nothing, this so-called king: the queen was the only power there. And she was a Vesuvius. As a favor, she might consent to warm a flock of sparrows for you, but then she might take that very opportunity to turn herself loose and bury a city. However, I reflected that as often as any other way, when you are expecting the worst, you get something that is not so bad, after all.|$|E

I told him that he was not, having gone on half-pay for the present on account of a wound. He seemed rather pleased than otherwise, I thought, and I asked him pretty bluntly what he wanted to know for. He brought an {{interpreter}} with him, and said through him that he hoped that I would not press that question, especially as a lady was concerned in the matter. <b>It</b> <b>bothered</b> <b>me</b> entirely. Why, from the time we landed at the Mondego till your father was hit at Vimiera I don't believe we ever had the chance to speak to a woman. It may be that it was some lady that nursed him there after we had marched away, and who had taken a fancy to him. The ould man may have been her father, and was perhaps mighty glad to hear that the major was not coming back again." ...|$|E

I thought he hadn't long to live. Everything he said and did was wonderful to me, like poetry and music. And then {{when he began to}} grow stronger and I saw {{that he was going to}} get well, and Cliff went on the rampage and showed the yellow streak, and I gave him back his ring--I didn't know even then how much Wayland meant to me. But on our trip over the Range I understood. He meant everything to me. He made Cliff seem like a savage, and I wanted him to know it. I'm not ashamed of loving him. I want to make him happy, and if he wishes me to be his wife I'll go anywhere he says--only I think he should stay out here till he gets entirely well." ...|$|E
