5|$|The Act II {{illustration}} from Les Beautés shows a <b>dark</b> <b>wood</b> {{with a pool}} {{of water}} in the distance. The branches of aged trees create a tree tunnel. Beneath these branches on the left is a marble cross with 'Giselle' carved on it. From one of its arms hangs the crown of grape leaves Giselle wore as Queen of the Vintage. On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were the undergrowth. The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in the flies were turned low to create a mood of mystery and terror.|$|E
5|$|To address criticisms {{levelled}} at Blyton's work some later editions {{have been}} altered to reflect more liberal attitudes towards {{issues such as}} race, gender and the treatment of children; modern reprints of the Noddy series substitute teddy bears or goblins for golliwogs, for instance. The golliwogs who steal Noddy's car and dump him naked in the <b>Dark</b> <b>Wood</b> in Here Comes Noddy Again are replaced by goblins in the 1986 revision, who strip Noddy only of his shoes and hat and return {{at the end of}} the story to apologise.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} building's interior initially had <b>dark</b> <b>wood</b> {{panels and}} {{was decorated with}} flowers, oriental rugs on the terrazzo floor, and tables and chairs in the Mission style. In 1959, when the library moved in, local architect and village resident William Anders Sharman planned the building's $2,000 renovation; he later became {{the first president of}} the Briarcliff Manor-Scarborough Historical Society. The station's circular ticket office was replaced by the librarian's desk, bookshelves replaced station furniture, and the baggage room became the children's section. Former library president Theodore R. Malsin dedicated the children's room in memory of his son Donald. From 1959 until 2009, the building housed a main reading room and children's room; a vestibule and second-story balcony were added in 1980.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} of the chapel is decorated in a pattern of azulejo tile, while the stone spans are painted in faux-marble. On {{either side of the}} lateral walls are two built-in confessionals, with doors painted in red and decorative elements in gold, as well as faux marble interiors, framed in shells. The high-choir with balustrade is painted in blue and red, with the area of the sub-choir marked by lattice in <b>dark</b> <b>wood,</b> painted orange, with acanthus in gold-leaf and cartouche with a flaming heart pierced by arrows.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the cathedral consists of a row of ornate, larger-than-life statues of saints along the side aisles, sculptured and painted in minute detail; many of these statues were installed in 1924 by priest and artist Rev. Fr. J Milliner. Open confessionals of intricately carved <b>dark</b> <b>wood</b> are also placed along the aisles. On the left, {{in front of the}} sanctuary is a unique dark skinned statue of the Madonna called 'Our Lady of Kotahena', which is taken in procession during the annual celebrations. Altars of white marble are located in the transepts of the church with relics enshrined within them.|$|E

25|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{was the first}} to permit smoking in rooms on the State floor. To accommodate smoking, Jacqueline Kennedy wanted portable ashtrays for the East Room. She initially considered modified versions of ashtrays seen at the home of her friend, Bunny Mellon, but rejected this idea in favor of a unique design. Maison Jansen designed stands which featured brass legs shaped like bamboo, brass handles, and Carrara glass tops. The ashtrays cost $280, were manufactured in Maison Jansen's New York City office, and delivered in January 1963. Finding the cost too high (and without any economy of scale cost-savings), Kennedy then designed her own portable standing ashtrays. Twenty were eventually manufactured out of <b>dark</b> <b>wood</b> by White House carpenters, although the gray granite tops for the Kennedy-designed ashtrays were made by Jansen at a cost of $310.|$|E
25|$|A {{noticeable}} {{feature is}} the missing main altar, which is known only from a description found in the inventory from 1766. It was carved from <b>dark</b> <b>wood,</b> gilded, and served as the focal center of the otherwise white interior. The altar had two levels. The upper level had a miraculous painting of Saint Peter that was most likely brought from the previous church. It was surrounded by sculptures of the twelve apostles representing the twelve tribes of Israel or the chosen people. The lower lever had a painting of Saint Paul surrounded by sculptures depicting twelve pagan nations representing the world or the converted people. This altar {{was moved to the}} Catholic church in Daugai in 1766 and only fragments survive to the present day. With the loss of the altar, imagery of Saint Paul diminished significantly within the church. The altar as such was not replaced. Instead, Kazimierz Jelski sculpted four prophets (Daniel, Jeremiah, Isaiah and Elijah) while Franciszek Smuglewicz painted the large central painting depicting the emotional final parting of Saint Peter and Paul.|$|E
25|$|In 1896, Charlie Russell {{and his new}} wife, Nancy, {{were living}} in a shack in back of a house in Cascade, Montana. In 1897, the couple moved into a rented four-room home on Seventh Avenue North in Great Falls. In December 1899, Russell's father Charles Silas Russell gave the couple $500. The estate of Mary Mead Russell, Russell's mother who died in 1895, was finally probated shortly thereafter, and in the spring of 1900 the Russells began {{building}} a new home on the corner of 13th Street and 4th Avenue North. A friend and neighbor, George Calvert, was the likely architect and constructed the house for them. The two-story wood frame building had clapboard siding, gable roof, and wooden shake roofing shingles. It had little exterior ornamentation. The house faced south, with gable fronted dormers on the east and west and another project slightly from the southwest corner of the house. The front door led to a small front hall, and a parlor ran across the south face of the home. Also on the first floor were dining room, bathroom, kitchen, and a small maid's room off the kitchen. Some of the furniture on first floor (such as two seats, a china closet, a bookcase) were built into the home. A steep stairway led to three small bedrooms (under the gables) and a small bathroom on the second floor. The interior was paneled in <b>dark</b> <b>wood.</b> A small exterior porch ran around the southeast corner of the home. The architectural style was in the Arts and Crafts genre. The Russells occupied the home in the summer of 1900.|$|E

25|$|Gambier-Parry {{designed}} the coped tomb of his father, which is positioned in the churchyard {{east of the}} chancel of the Church of the Holy Innocents. The monument to Thomas Gambier-Parry is Grade II listed. The architect also worked on the sanctuary and chancel arch of All Saints' Church on Oakleigh Road North in Friern Barnet, London. In 1889 he restored the Church of St Margaret in Bagendon, Gloucestershire, now Grade 1 listed. Improvements made to the Grade II* listed Church of St Mary in Bayford, Hertfordshire in 1890 were to his design. Gambier-Parry made design changes to the Grade II* listed Church of St James in Quedgeley, Gloucestershire about 1890. The glass in the chancel east window of Elmore Church in Elmore, Gloucestershire, was dedicated to Sir William Vernon Guise and designed by Gambier-Parry in 1890. He also made improvements to Elmore Court in Elmore, Gloucestershire in the late 19th century. In 1894 to 1895, he restored and enlarged the Grade II* listed St James' Church in Cranham, Gloucestershire. In 1895 he made design changes to St Michael Church in Boulge, Suffolk, {{on behalf of the}} Holmes White family. Gambier-Parry was also responsible for the late 19th century alabaster-work in the sanctuary of the Lady Chapel of St Mary the Virgin, Bathwick. He was the architect of Whitemoor, opposite Amberley Church, {{in the western part of}} the parish of Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire. In 1908 Gambier-Parry {{designed the}} Grade II listed Iveson Manor in Ampney St Peter, Gloucestershire. About 1908, the first vicar of the Grade II* listed St Mary the Virgin, Bourne Street in London selected him to replace the reredos of the high altar. The architect installed an arch fabricated of <b>dark</b> <b>wood</b> and, above the arch, ornamentation in a sunburst design. He also built the organ case and loft for St Mary's Bourne Street, using an English baroque style, with pediments, scrollwork, and finials. The Grade II listed Pytte House of Clyst St George, Devon, was renovated and enlarged by Gambier-Parry in 1911. In the 1930s, he restored St Michael's Church (pictured) at Duntisbourne Rouse in Gloucestershire, at the same time living in the nearby old rectory. The church was Grade I listed in 1958.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of sale in 2008, Pikes Hotel had 29 bedrooms, with a pool, sauna, health centre, and tennis court.
