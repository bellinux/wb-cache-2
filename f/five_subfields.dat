40|$|Ecological {{anthropology}} explores how culture {{influences the}} dynamic interactions between human populations and the ecosystems in their habitat through time. The primary approaches within ecological anthropology are cultural ecology, historical ecology, political ecology, and spiritual ecology. This sequence of approaches reflects the historical {{development of the}} subject, largely since the 1950 ’s. By now ecological anthropology is a mature topical specialization that crosscuts the <b>five</b> <b>subfields</b> of contemporary anthropology. It has its own separate unit within the American Anthropological Association called the Anthropology and Environment Sectio...|$|E
40|$|Design: Cross-sectional {{population-based}} cohort study. Purpose: Macular thinning may be {{an early}} sign of diabetic retinopathy. We therefore evaluated to what extent macular thickness differed between individuals with prediabetes (preDM 2) and individuals with type 2 diabetes (DM 2) without cysts compared with individuals with a normal glucose metabolism (NGM). Methods: Using SD-OCT we measured macular thickness in <b>five</b> ETDRS <b>subfields</b> in 2385 participants (mean age 59 ± 8 years, 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{competitiveness}} {{of the major}} European countries compared to the United States and Japan is analysed for the area of telecommunications. The analysis is performed by a patent analysis subdivided into <b>five</b> telecom <b>subfields.</b> According to this, the European position in line-bound communication and radio transmission is still satisfying. There are, however, recent indications of a relative growth of American and Japanese activities. Japan dominates the sector of telecom terminals. The increasing role of Japan is confirmed by external trade statistics...|$|R
50|$|Clayton's works {{surprised}} astrophysicists with foundational {{ideas for}} <b>five</b> original <b>subfields</b> of astrophysics: (1) nucleosynthesis, {{the assembly of}} the atomic nuclei of the common chemical elements by nuclear reactions within the stars; (2) astronomy of gamma-ray lines emitted by radioactive atoms created and ejected by supernovae; (3) growth in time of the interstellar abundances of radioactive atoms; (4) predicted existence of interstellar cosmic dust grains, which he named stardust, containing isotopically identifiable condensation of radioactive atoms; (5) predicted condensation of solid grains of carbon within hot, oxygen-dominated radioactive supernova gases. Clayton published these original ideas from research positions at California Institute of Technology, Rice University, Cambridge University, Max-Plank Institute for Nuclear Physics, Durham University and Clemson University during an academic career spanning six decades.|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundIt {{is widely}} held that single cells in {{anterior}} cingulate and lateral prefrontal cortex (ACC/PFC) coordinate their activity during attentional processes, although cellular activity that may underlie such coordination across ACC/PFC has not been identified. We thus recorded cells in <b>five</b> ACC/PFC <b>subfields</b> of macaques {{engaged in a}} selective attention task, characterized those spiking events that indexed attention, and identified how spiking of distinct cell populations synchronized between brain areas. ResultsWe found that cells in ACC/PFC increased the firing of brief 200  Hz spike bursts when subjects shifted attention and engaged in selective visual processing. In contrast to nonburst spikes, burst spikes synchronized over large distances to local field potentials at narrow beta (12 – 20  Hz) and at gamma (50 – 75  Hz) frequencies. Long-range burst synchronization was anatomically specific, functionally connecting those subfields in area 24 (ACC) and area 46 (PFC) that are key players of attentional control. By splitting cells into putative excitatory (pE) and inhibitory (pI) cells by their broad and narrow spikes, we identified that bursts of pI cells preceded and that bursts of pE cells followed in time periods of maximal beta coherent network activity. In contrast, gamma bursts were transient impulses with equal timing across cell classes. ConclusionsThese findings suggest that processes underlying burst firing and burst synchronization are candidate mechanisms to coordinate attention information across brain areas. We speculate that distinct burst-firing motifs realize beta and gamma synchrony to trigger versus maintain functional network states during goal-directed behavior...|$|R
