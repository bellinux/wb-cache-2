2500|$|The FBI {{underwent}} a 30-day review {{to examine the}} lapses in the background-check system that allowed the suspected shooter to legally purchase the gun used in the shooting. According to James Comey, Roof had been arrested in March on a felony drug charge, which would have required an inquiry into the charge during the background check examination. However, he was actually arrested on a misdemeanor drug charge, which was incorrectly written as a felony at first due to a <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>error</b> made by a jail clerk. The mistake was noticed by the jail {{two days after the}} arrest, but the change was not made. The FBI agent conducting the background check examination then called the wrong agency while making the inquiry into the drug charge, due to having limited information on law enforcement agencies in Lexington County. This subsequently allowed Roof to make the purchase. However, despite the misdemeanor charge, he still {{would not have been able}} to purchase the gun under a law that barred anyone who is an [...] "unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance" [...] from owning firearms. Several bills aiming to fix this loophole were proposed, and South Carolina legislation planned to discuss the loophole in 2016.|$|E

5000|$|A {{transcription}} {{error is}} {{a specific type of}} <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>error</b> that is commonly made by human operators or by optical character recognition programs (OCR). Human transcription errors are commonly the result of typographical mistakes; putting one’s fingers in the wrong place while touch typing is the easiest way to make this error. (The slang term [...] "stubby fingers" [...] is sometimes used for people who commonly make this mistake.) Electronic transcription errors occur when the scan of some printed matter is compromised or in an unusual font - for example, if the paper is crumpled, or the ink is smudged, the OCR may make transcription errors when reading.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} and scientific usage of patient-reported outcome measures is increasing {{in the health}} services. Often paper forms are used. Manual double entry of data {{is defined as the}} definitive gold standard for transferring data to an electronic format, but the process is laborious. Automated forms processing may be an alternative, but further validation is warranted. Methods: 200 patients were randomly selected from a cohort of 5777 patients who had previously answered two different questionnaires. The questionnaires were scanned using an automated forms processing technique, as well as processed by single and double manual data entry, using the EpiData Entry data entry program. The main outcome measure was the proportion of correctly entered numbers at question, form and study level. Results: Manual double-key <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (<b>error</b> proportion per 1000 fields = 0. 046 (95 % CI: 0. 001 – 0. 258)) performed better than single-key <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (<b>error</b> proportion per 1000 fields = 0. 370 (95 % CI: 0. 160 – 0. 729), (p = 0. 020)). There was no statistical difference between Optical Mark Recognition (error proportion per 1000 fields = 0. 046 (95 % CI: 0. 001 – 0. 258)) and double-key data entry (p = 1. 000). With the Intelligent Character Recognition method, there was no statistical difference compared to single-key <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (<b>error</b> proportion per 1000 fields = 6. 734 (95 % CI: 0. 817 – 24. 113), (p = 0. 656)), as well as double-key <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> (<b>error</b> proportion per 1000 fields = 3. 367 (95 % CI: 0. 085 – 18. 616)), (p = 0. 319)) ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{adoption}} of electronic medical records (EMRs) in emergency departments (EDs) {{has changed the}} way that healthcare information is collected, charted, and stored.

40|$|Data {{errors in}} {{electronic}} health records {{have been shown}} to have the potential to adversely impact the conclusions drawn from clinical research. We prospectively studied the efficacy of a new alert to infer errors in previously stored data and to decrease the frequency of <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>errors,</b> in an attempt {{to improve the quality of}} data for clinical trials. For the purpose of this study, we monitored <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>errors</b> in height or weight measurements. We predetermined the criteria for probable error as a ten percent variance from a patient’s reference value. The care provider entering a value satisfying our error criteria received a disruptive pop-up alert message. The study revealed a significant decrease in the frequency of data errors stored in the EHR, from 2. 4 % before the alert to 0. 9 % after the alert. These findings have implications for the development of clinical research trial data collection support tools...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: We {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} DICOM worklist software for radiological modalities {{from the viewpoint of}} risk management, to reduce mislabeled image data in an electronic archiving environment. We focused on the following five points: 1) the effectiveness of the DICOM modality worklist, 2) problems involving incorrect patient and image data, 3) the presence of incorrect profiles despite the transfer of patient profiles online via the DICOM worklist, 4) ways to eliminate entry failure, and 5) further examination even if <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> were correct. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data of patient profiles with image data were evaluated both before and after installation of DICOM modality worklist management software at Sakai Municipal Hospital. All radiology modalities were connected to RIS terminals in which DICOM modality worklist software was installed. Patient profiles were transferred online from RIS terminals to the modalities. It was not necessary for technologists to type patient profiles in usual examinations. Results: Before installing the DICOM modality worklist software, the number of <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>errors</b> was 31 and the rate was 6. 4 % of 487 examinations. After installation, manual <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> occurred in 80 of 1, 994 examinations.

40|$|The {{enumeration}} {{of bacteria}} using plate-based counts is a core technique used by {{food and water}} microbiology testing laboratories. However, manual counting of bacterial colonies is both time and labour intensive, can vary between operators and also requires manual entry of results into laboratory information management systems, {{which can be a}} source of <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>error.</b> An alternative is to use automated digital colony counters, but {{there is a lack of}} peer-reviewed validation data to allow incorporation into standards. We compared the performance of digital counting technology (ProtoCOL 3) against manual counting using criteria defined in internationally recognized standard methods. Digital colony counting provided a robust, standardized system suitable for adoption in a commercial testing environment. The digital technology has several advantages:• Improved measurement of uncertainty by using a standard and consistent counting methodology with less operator error. • Efficiency for labour and time (reduced cost). • Elimination of manual entry of data onto LIMS. • Faster result reporting to customers...|$|E
40|$|Medication {{errors are}} among the most common medical errors in the hospitals. Transcription error is a {{specific}} type of medication errors and is due to <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>error</b> that is commonly made by the human operators. This study was designed to detect transcription errors in a teaching hospital in Tehran. Direct observational method was used in this study. Error was defined as any deviation in transcribing medication order from the previous step (order on the order sheet, administration nursing note and/or cardex, documentation of the order in the pharmacy database). A total of 287 charts with 558 opportunities for error were reviewed. Of those opportunities for error 167 (29. 9 %) resulted in an error. Omission (the patient did not receive the medication that was ordered) was the highest (52 %) transcription error type seen in this study. The evaluation clearly showed that errors at transcription stage were not infrequent. To cut these errors down we suggest implementation of surveillance systems, which might help to decrease medication errors...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} way to {{increase}} the usability of password authentication systems by compensating for transposition and substitution errors. We show how to correct for these errors with low false positive rates (i. e., low probability that an arbitrary string will be accepted as the password for authentication). Thus our techniques increase usability with provably little loss of security. In particular, we propose applying a single password-corrective hash function to each entered password attempt. The key property of the hash function is that two strings differing by a single <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> <b>error</b> be likely to be hashed to the same key, while more substantially differing strings are hashed to different keys. We develop precise analytical formulae for the precision/recall tradeoffs {{for a variety of}} corrective hash functions. We evaluate these methods at parameter values reflecting common classes of keys/passwords. Finally, we evaluate these schemes using a popular crack-list (dictionary) of 680, 000 common words. We show that we can correct for all user transposition errors while reducing the computational cost of a crack attack by only 13 %. ...|$|E
