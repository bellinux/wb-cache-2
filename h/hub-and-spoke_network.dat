The system equips each node {{in the network}} with quantum transmitters—i.e., lasers—but not with expensive and bulky photon detectors. Only the hub receives quantum messages. To communicate, each node sends a one-time pad to the hub, which it then uses to communicate securely over a classical link. The hub can route this message to another node using another one time pad from the second node. The entire network is secure only if the central hub is secure. Individual nodes require {{little more than a}} laser: Prototype nodes are around the size of a box of matches.|$|E

DMVPN is initially configured to build out a <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>network</b> by statically configuring the hubs (VPN headends) on the spokes, {{no change in the}} configuration on the hub is required to accept new spokes. Using this initial <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>network,</b> tunnels between spokes can be dynamically built on demand (dynamic-mesh) without additional configuration on the hubs or spokes.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{provides}} an exhaustive {{discussion of the}} impact of airline deregulation in the U. S., followed by a discussion of the likely effects of deregulation in the EU. The paper argues that the benefits of U.

S. carriers. Such an efficiency improvement is necessary if EU deregulation is to lead to lower fares, as in the U. S. However, the paper identifies convenient rail service, which reduces the willingness of passengers to undertake circuitous airline trips, as one impediment to the formation of <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>networks.</b> Another impediment is airport congestion, which is more serious in the EU than in the U.

40|$|Airline {{networks}} may {{be interpreted}} as structures that express strategic choices made by airlines to serve or not to serve given airports. Research into network strategies of airlines {{in the past has}} focused on economies (of density) and market power. More recent research focuses on managerial decisions related to capacity choices, such as the frequency or scheduling of flights, which are related to the size and evolution of <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>networks.</b> Other streams of research within the natural sciences, have characterized many networks as not random chaotic structures but as efficient complex formations. This paper will interpret European <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>networks</b> as complex networks in the sense of statistical physics and classify their structural components into distinctive connectivity distributions. From the identified distributions, implications will be drawn for strategic management in general and for hub-and-spoke airlines in particular.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>networks</b> in intermodal transport is suggested {{as one of}} the potential solutions for helping to increase the intermodal market share. Traditionally, trains are shunted at hubs; this is a time-consuming process. Since the early 1990 s a new type of intermodal terminal, specifically designed for fast tran-shipment at nodes in <b>hub-and-spoke</b> <b>networks,</b> has been introduced in Europe. These hub terminals could replace this time-consuming shunting. Studies on the new hub terminals suggest that they may perform more efficiently than shunting yards. However, a systematic comparison to reveal the operational and costs differences be-tween shunting and these new hub-terminals for a broad range of situations still lacks. The main objective {{of the study was to}} develop a model to identify favourable opera-tional conditions for new hub terminals to be implemented and to quantify their op-erational performances in relation to alternative hub exchange facilities. Simulation models were developed to study rail-rail exchange operations at new hub-terminals, hump and flat shuntings yard and road-rail terminals. OT...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a network planning problem called the hub network design problem with stopovers and feeders. Most, if not all, {{of the recent}} logistics research on <b>hub-and-spokes</b> <b>networks</b> has assumed that all nodes in the network are connected by direct flights to the hub. However, in the network used by the Federal Express Co., most flights {{to and from the}} hub make one or more stopovers, and many smaller cities are served by feeder aircraft which connect to other nonhub cities. This paper explores the tradeoffs and savings involved with stopovers and feeders, and develops a mixed-integer program to design the least-cost single-hub air network assuming that the hub location is already determined. The model is then applied to the western U. S. portion of the Federal Express package collection system. Comparing the optimal results to the pure <b>hub-and-spokes</b> <b>network</b> proves that substantial improvements in cost, miles flown, load factor and number of aircraft can be achieved by using stopovers and feeders in a hub network, and that it is unrealistic to assume a network with only direct flights. Comparison with the actual Federal Express network shows many similarities (which suggest that the model is capturing the important design criteria), and several differences (which indicate the model's potential for improving efficiency). The usefulness of the model for a company's comprehensive network planning and for hub location modeling is discussed. ...|$|R

Computational experiences indicate that by applying the derived upper bound for the number of hubs the proposed heuristic is capable of obtaining optimal solutions for all small-scaled problems very efficiently.
