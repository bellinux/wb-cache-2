According to the notch stress intensity factor (NSIF) approach, the weld bead is modeled as a sharp (zero radius) V-notch.

The temperature of BM specimen would rise rapidly with the beginning of crack propagation. Fatigue crack propagation lives of HAZ and FZ were estimated by monitoring the natural frequency of specimen, which was varying with the crack size during the fatigue testing. Results showed that more than 99 % of the total fatigue life was occupied by the crack initiation process for base metal (BM) and HAZ. However, this number was scattered for FZ specimen at relatively low stress amplitude owing to the crack propagation from welding defects directly, without crack initiate life...|$|R
40|$|AbstractLocal beam {{oscillation}} {{in remote}} laser welding of aluminum to copper was investigated. Sheets of 1 mm thickness were welded in overlap configuration with aluminum as top material. The laser beam was scanned in a sinusoidal mode {{perpendicular to the}} direction of feed {{and the influence of}} the oscillation parameters frequency and amplitude on the weld geometry was investigated. Scanning frequencies up to 1 kHz and oscillation amplitudes in the range from 0. 25 mm to 1 mm were examined. Throughout the experiments the laser power and the feed rate were kept constant. A decrease of welding depth with amplitude and frequency is found. The scanning amplitude had a strong influence and allowed coarse setting of the welding depth into the lower material, while the frequency allowed fine tuning in the order of 10 % of the obtained depth. The oscillation parameters were found to act differently on the aluminum sheet compared to copper sheet regarding the amount of fused material. It is possible to influence the geometry of the <b>fused</b> <b>zones</b> separately for both sheets. Therefore the average composition in the weld can be set with high precision via the oscillation parameters.

40|$|Filopodia that {{protrude}} {{forward from}} the lamellipodium, located {{at the leading edge}} of a neuronal growth cone, are needed to guide the extension of a nerve cell. At the core of each filopodium an actin bundle forms and grows into the lamellipodium. By using kymographs of time-lapse polarized light images we examined the relationship between the behavior of the filopodia, the actin bundles immediately proximal to the filopodia, and the shapes and composition of actin bundles in the whole lamellipodium. We find that the shapes of actin bundles, such as tilt, fork, and <b>fused</b> <b>zones,</b> originate at the leading edge and are surprisingly well preserved during retrograde transport of the actin cytoskeleton in the whole lamellipodium. The number of filaments that make up the radial actin bundles, as displayed by their birefringence retardation, also is preserved during retrograde flow over a distance of 4 - 8 microm from the leading edge into the lamellipodium. Thus, the disposition of the actin bundles in the lamellipodium frozen at any time point preserves and portrays a history of the past behavior of actin bundles proximal to the filopodia and the behavior of the filopodia themselves. These findings suggest that the arrangement of actin bundles in static image records, such as electron or fluorescence micrographs of fixed and stained specimens, can in fact reveal the sequence of the past history of filopodial behavior and the generation, density, fusion, etc. of the filaments in the actin bundles...|$|R

Nevertheless they can produce a set of drawbacks like difficulty to assembly, reworking, limited fatigue life, and surface imperfections. In this paper Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium butt welds were produced by CO 2 laser welding. The following tolerable defects were analysed: weld undercut, excess weld metal, excessive penetration, incomplete filled groove, root concavity, and lack of penetration. A neuro-fuzzy model for the prediction and classification of the defects in the <b>fused</b> <b>zone</b> was built up using the experimental data. Weld imperfections were connected to the welding parameters by feed forward neural networks. Then the imperfections were clustered using the C-means fuzzy clustering algorithm.

The mechanical properties of the joints have been evaluated by performing tensile tests, hardness profiles across the weld sections, porosity measurements and EDX analyses. A design of experiment technique has been used to study the effects of the welding speed (v) and the incident laser power (P) on the aforementioned response variables that are considered to be representative for the weld quality. By comparing the welds obtained by operating at constant linear energy input released onto the material (P/v ratio), the best results have been found for higher laser powers and welding speeds. A clear correlation was found between the incidence of porosity, the tensile strength and the hardness of the <b>fused</b> <b>zone.</b> Welding reliability was enhanced for selected sets of process parameters capable of producing butt-joints showing mechanical properties very competitive if compared with the performances obtained, on similar aluminium alloys, using alternative joining technologies like friction stir welding or gas tungsten arc welding...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{aimed to}} clarify the {{clinical}} anatomy of the pulmonary root. Background. Many descriptions of valvular anatomy {{have focused on the}} annulus, leading to varied interpretations of abnormal valves. Methods. Twenty-two heart specimens with isolated pulmonary valvular stenosis were examined to analyze the gross structure of the pulmonary root. For comparison, we examined a normal series of a similar age range together with nine adult hearts. Serial histologic sections were prepared from five specimens. Results. The normal pulmonary valve is enclosed in a proximal sleeve of free-standing right ventricular infundibulum supporting the fibroelastic walls of the pulmonary sinuses at the anatomic ventriculoarterial junction. The valvular leaflets are attached in semilunar fashion across this junction, delimiting the extent of the valvular sinuses. The stenotic valves were separated into dome-shaped valves, dysplastic valves and a third group of less typical cases. In the dome-shaped valves, which had a relatively circular origin of their leaflets, three raphes were tethered to the arterial wall at the sinutubular junction, producing a waistlike narrowing. The leaflets of the dysplastic valves were attached in a relatively normal semilunar fashion, but stenosis was caused by thickening of the leaflets at their free edges. Serial histologic sections through normal and abnormal valves failed to demonstrate any well defined fibrous “annulus” that could be of clinical relevance. Conclusions. Unlike the normal and the dysplastic valves, the dome-shaped valves have circular rather than semilunar lines of attachment of the valvular leaflets. Liberation of the <b>fused</b> <b>zones</b> of apposition of the leaflets within the dome is unlikely to restore such abnormal valves to normal structure, even if this procedure relieves the stenosis...|$|R

We here demonstrate axonal co-transport of BRP and RBP using intravital live imaging, with both proteins co-accumulating in axonal aggregates of several transport mutants. RBP, via its C-terminal Src-homology 3 (SH 3) domains, binds Aplip 1 /JIP 1, a transport adaptor involved in kinesin-dependent SV transport. We show in atomic detail that RBP C-terminal SH 3 domains bind a proline-rich (PxxP) motif of Aplip 1 /JIP 1 with submicromolar affinity. Pointmutating this PxxP motif provoked formation of ectopic AZ-like structures at axonal membranes. Direct interactions between AZ proteins and transport adaptors seem to provide complex avidity and shield synaptic interaction surfaces of pre-assembled scaffold protein transport complexes, thus, favouring physiological synaptic AZ assembly over premature assembly at axonal membranes.

Recently, mutants of the Drosophila melanogaster ERC/CAST family protein Bruchpilot (BRP) were shown to lack dense projections (T-bars) and to suffer from Ca 2 + channel–clustering defects. In this study, we used high resolution light microscopy, electron microscopy, and intravital imaging to analyze the function of BRP in AZ assembly. Consistent with truncated BRP variants forming shortened T-bars, we identify BRP as a direct T-bar component at the AZ center with its N terminus closer to the AZ membrane than its C terminus. In contrast, Drosophila Liprin-α, another AZ-organizing protein, precedes BRP during the assembly of newly forming AZs by several hours and surrounds the AZ center in few discrete punctae.

The measurement technique subjected less than 5 {{percent of the}} sample surface area to stresses above 90 percent of the failure strength. Seven micrometeorite or space debris impacts occurred at locations which were not in that portion of the sample subjected to greater than 90 percent of the applied stress. In consequence of this, the impact events on the sample were not detected in mechanical strength measurements. The physical form and structure of the impact sites was carefully examined to determine the influence of those events upon stress concentration associated with the impact and the resulting mechanical strength influence. The size of the impact site insofar as it determines flaw size for fracture purposes was examined. Surface topography of the impacts reveals that six of the seven sites display impact melting.

The moving source was modelled by associating an internal heat generation to several specific elements in the weld zone. Both homogeneous and dissimilar joints were assembled in butt configuration.

40|$|Process {{parameters}} modeling {{have always}} been one of the key aspects in development of an adaptive control of arc welding process. The welding process parameters are inherently nonlinear, time-delayed, and interdependent, and their on-time adjustment highly influences a sound weld bead formation and process monitoring. During the welding process, parameters control is the primary goal to leads a quality welding. Moreover, the final weld joint behavior, i. e., residual stress, welding strength, and micro-crack formation are generally observed after cooling of the weld product. Thus, it has always been a difficult task to control mechanical properties of a final weld joint. To obtain the best mechanical properties, the final weld joint characteristics needed to be controlled and predicted during the process itself by precise adjustment of the process parameters. The paper presents a neuro-fuzzy modeling approach to provide adaptive control for the automatic process parameter adjustment. Three input parameters wire feed speed, welding gap, and torch speed are modeled with welding current output, providing control over weld bead formation during the welding. The same input process parameters are also modeled to predict final weld joint characteristics, i. e., dilution ratio, hardness of weld bead, hardness of <b>fused</b> <b>zone,</b> and bead width. In order to ascertain the effectiveness of the neuro-fuzzy modeling approach, multiple regression models were also developed to compare the performances. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Londo...|$|E

Abscission occurred in the SZ 1 in very young fruit (fruit still at the ovary stage), during early fruit development (5 weeks after full bloom; WAFB), and in ripe and overripe fruit (15 - 17 WAFB). Abscission did not spontaneously occur in the SZ 2, {{but by the time the}} fruit was fully ripe, 15 WAFB, and later, a slight mechanical force was sufficient to break this zone. In fruit bunches severed from the tree at 5, 8 and 13 WAFB, break strength (BS) in SZ 1 decreased much more after exogenous ethylene treatment than that in SZ 2. Ethylene induced abscission in the SZ 1, but not in SZ 2. At 5, 8 and 13 WAFB, treatment with 1 -methylcyclopropane (1 -MCP; an inhibitor of ethylene perception) had a small effect on BS in the SZ 1 and no effect in the SZ 2.

40|$|Fusion welding {{of steel}} {{pressure}} vessels provides {{one of the}} most economic methods for creating such structures. However, the highly localised heat distribution, at the fused region gives rise to non-uniform heating / expansion and cooling / contraction of the weld and the surrounding base material, consequently giving rise to residual stresses and distortion. Several techniques are available to minimize welding distortions and residual stresses [1]. One feasible and efficient mitigation technique, that alters the inherent residual stresses developed during welding, includes the use of low transformation start temperature welding wire [2 e 4]. By altering the filler material and metallurgical transformations developed at the fusion zone and heat affected zone, wielded regions at the weld line can give rise to compressive residual stresses [2]. Consequently by establishing the appropriate chemical composition of the welding wire, a significant reduction in welding distortions can be achieved. This study focuses on establishing the merits of using different filler materials to minimize welding residual stresses and distortion through a thermal-metallurgical-elasto-plastic numerical parametric study. Numerical modelling of butt welded structures using three different filler materials is considered and the applicability of using low transformation temperature welding wire is investigated.

Examination of five glass types and one glass ceramic located on both the Earth-facing side and the trailing edge revealed no reduction in strength within experimental limits. Strength measurements subjected less than 5 {{percent of the sample}} surface area to stresses above 90 percent of the glass's failure strength. Seven micrometeorite or space debris impacts occurred on trailing edge samples. One of those impacts occurred in a location which was subjected to 50 percent of the applied stress at failure. Micrometeorite or space debris impacts were not observed on Earth-facing samples. The physical shape and structure of the impact sites were carefully examined using stereographic scanning electron microscopy. These impacts induce a stress concentration at the damaged region which influences mechanical strength. The flaw size produced by such damage was examined to determine the magnitude of strength degradation in micrometeorite or space-debris impacted glasses. Scanning electron microscopy revealed topographical details of impact sites which included central melt zones and glass fiber production.

Dessa forma, espera-se fornecer atravÃs deste trabalho um maior aprofundamento a respeito da soldagem dissimilar entre o aÃo inoxidÃvel ferrÃtico AISI 444 e o aÃo inoxidÃvel austenÃtico AISI 316 L, avaliando os parÃmetros operacionais, como a pulsaÃÃo da corrente e a energia de soldagem sobre a microestrutura obtida, bem como as propriedades mecÃnicas...|$|E
40|$|Super duplex {{stainless}} steel (SDSS) {{has found a}} wide use in demanding applications such as offshore, chemical and petrochemical industries thanks to its excellent combination of mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. Welding of SDSS, however, {{is associated with the}} risk of precipitation of secondary phases and formation of excessive amounts of ferrite in the weld metal and heat affected zone. The present study was therefore aimed at gaining knowledge about the effect of multiple welding thermal cycles on the microstructure and possible sensitization to corrosion of welds in SDSS. Controlled and repeatable thermal cycles were produced by robotic welding. Oneto four autogenous TIG-remelting passes were applied on 2507 type SDSS plates using low or high heat inputs with pure argon as shielding gas. Thermal cycles were recorded using several thermocouples attached to the plates. Thermodynamic calculations and temperature field modelling were performed {{in order to understand the}} microstructural development and to predict the pitting corrosion resistance. Etching revealed the formation of different zones with characteristic microstructures: the <b>fused</b> weld <b>zone</b> (WZ) and the heat affected zone composed of the fusion boundary zone (FBZ), next to the fusion boundary, and further out Zone 1 (Z 1) and Zone 2 (Z 2). The WZ had a high content of ferrite and often nitrides which increased with increasing number of passes and decreasing heati nput. Nitrogen content of the WZ decreased from 0. 28 wt. % to 0. 17 wt. % after four passes of low heat input and to 0. 10 wt. % after four passes of high heatinput. The FBZ was reheated to high peak temperatures (near melting point) and contained equiaxed ferrite grains with austenite and nitrides. Zone 1 was free from precipitates and the ferrite content was similar to that of the unaffected base material. Sigma phase precipitated only in zone 2, which was heated to peak temperatures in the range of approximately 828 °C to 1028 °C. The content of sigma phase increased with the number of passes and increasing heat input.   All locations, except Z 1, were susceptible to local corrosion after multiplere heating. Thermodynamic calculations predicted that a post weld heat treatment could restore the corrosion resistance of the FBZ and Z 2. However, the pitting resistance of the WZ cannot be improved significantly due to the nitrogen loss. Steady state and linear fitting approaches were therefore employed to predict nitrogen loss in autogenous TIG welding with argon as shielding gas. Two practical formulas were derived giving nitrogen loss as functions of initial nitrogen content and arc energy both predicting a larger loss for higher heat input and higher base material nitrogen content. A practical recommendation based on the present study is that it is beneficial to perform welding with a minimum number of passes even if this results in a higherheat input as multiple reheating strongly promotes formation of deleterious phases...|$|R
40|$|It is {{considered}} that fusion welding {{should be the}} most promising technique in glass joining, since joining can be accomplished without any intermediated layer and mechanical contact. High precision, small heat-affected zone (HAZ) and small shock-affected zone (SAZ) makes ultra-short pulsed laser capable to perform the process with minimal damages to the surrounding area. However, {{there are still a}} lot of things to be clarified in this process, since glass materials are veiy sensitive to temperature gradients and available in different thermal properties. In this study, molten zones created by high ultra-short pulsed laser in borosilicate glass (Schott D 263) and fused silica were evaluated. Laser irradiation was done inside the glass some micrometers below the top surface under various processing conditions. Molten zone was observed visually and its strength was measured using bending test. Actual fusion welding of two glass plates was also successfully demonstrated and evaluated by strength measurement. The influence of polarization, feed rate v, incident laser power Win and pulse repetition rate Rp to molten zone strength and appearance were discussed. Main conclusions in this study are as follows:- a) There was no obvious influence to the molten zone appearance by the difference of beam polarizations. b) Incident laser power played the most important role in controlling molten zone size. Molten zone size increased with the increment of laser power. c) Cracks and bubbles were effectively reduced by selecting the proper pulse repetition rate. Low pulse repetition rate led to cracking at the surrounding area of molten zone and high pulse repetition rate caused cracking in the bottom area of molten zone. d) Measurement of mechanical strength had proven that low feed rate offered wider applicable pulse repetition rate with no fatal strength decrement of molten zone by ultra-short pulse laser.

40|$|The {{role of the}} spectrin-based {{membrane}} skeleton in {{cell fusion}} was studied by following the condition-dependent diameter versus time expansion signature of the fusion zone in electrofused pairs of erythrocyte ghost membranes. Previous work showed {{that the presence of}} the dielectrophoresis-inducing alternating electric field, which is used to bring membranes into contact through pearl chain formation, had a detectable promoting effect on fusion zone expansion. Two new dielectrophoresis protocols were used in the present work to utilize this externally generated and controllable microforce field to probe the forces intrinsic to the system that drives the expansion of the fusion zone. First, fusion zones expanded to a greater diameter in a strong AC field compared to a weak AC field, and they expanded to a greater diameter if erythrocyte ghosts received a prior heat treatment (42 degrees C, 20 min). Furthermore, flat diaphragm fusion zones broke down into open lumen fusion zones sooner (i. e., had shorter lifetimes) when they were expanding more quickly. Second, changing the AC field strength at specific times during the fusion zone expansion led to an immediate visco-elastic response. However, shifting the AC field strength to zero after 5 s of fusion zone expansion resulted in a subsequent decrease in the average fusion zone diameter. This suggests not only that the spectrin-based membrane skeleton actually tends to prevent the rounding up process but that it may be capable of generating an antirounding force, which has broad implications for the role of the membrane skeleton in cell fusion. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that flat diaphragm fusion zones induced in heat-treated membranes were very easily stretched and that membrane-based forces that control or drive the expansion process must originate from membrane area that is outside rather than inside the fusion zone. Lastly, when an outward-directed osmotic pressure-based microforce was present at the time that erythrocyte ghosts were <b>fused,</b> the fusion <b>zone</b> diameter underwent a greater expansion in the 0 - 1 s interval after fusion. This suggests that an osmotic pressure-based microforce can be used to experimentally calibrate the dielectrophoretic force...|$|R
40|$|Os aços Maraging são aços de ultra-alta-resistência, tem composição à base de ferro ligado com cerca de 18 % de níquel, com limite de esoamento entre 1. 400 a 2. 500 MPa. Possuem propriedades superiores, tais como a alta ductilidade, boa soldabilidade, tratamento térmico simples sem deformações, boa usinabilidade, alta resistência e resistência ao desgaste. A sua boa tenacidade permiti que suporte tensões repetidas de fadiga por maior tempo, comparado com outros aços de alta resistência. Para o presente trabalho, a partir de diversos testes de solda a laser, aplicação de tratamentos térmicos e tratamento {{superficial}} de nitretação a plasma, foram estudadas as propriedades mecânicas através de ensaios de tração, fadiga, impacto, dureza e rugosidade. Foram também analisadas, com auxílio do Microscópio Óptico, as características microstuturais da zona de fusão (ZF), zona térmica afetada (ZTA) pelo calor da solda e camada nitretada. Com o auxílio de um Microscópio Eletrônico de Varredura (MEV) analisou-se o mecanismo da fratura e foram realizadas análises por E. D. S. (Energia Dispersiva de Raios X). Foram realizados vários teste com tempos e temperaturas para se definir a melhor condição de envelhecimento, obteve-se a temperatura de 480 °C por 3 horas como satisfatoria. A solda a laser mostrou-se eficaz para a união das chapas, com perda de resistência inferior a 10 %, quando comparada com a resistência do aço maraging sem solda. As análises da superfície fraturada mostram que a ruptura dos corpos de prova soldados ocorrereu na região da zona fundida, e possui natureza dúctil, com a formação de dimples, para todas as condições de tratamento térmico, o processo de soldagem e nitretação a plasma não alteraram o tipo de fratura típica dos aços maraging. A vida em fadiga não foi prejudicada pela nitretação, porém, foi observado uma redução da vida em fadiga do material soldado comparado com o material sem solda. Os resultados indicam, que o tratamento térmico de envelhecimento elevou as propriedades mecânicas do aço maraging tanto do material soldado como do nitretetado a plasma, com valores de resistência de aproximadamente 2. 000 MPa e alongamento em torno de 8 %. Maraging Steels are ultra-high-strength, {{that have}} their composition based on iron alloyed with approximately 18 % Nickel, with yield strength between 1. 400 to 2. 400 MPa. They have superior properties, {{such as high}} ductility, good weldability, simple heat treatment without deformation, good machinability, high strength and wear resistance. Their hardness and resistance allow them to supports repeated stress of longer fatigue in comparison with other high strength steels. The maraging steel has a significant cost advantage due to the good workability, predictable and uniform retraction during heat treatment, making this steel be promising. For this work, from various laser welding tests, heat treatment and surface treatment of plasma nitriding, The mechanical properties were studied by means of testing: traction; fatigue; impact; hardness; and roughness. We also analyze, {{with the aid of}} optical microscope, the microstructural characteristics of the fusion zone (FZ), the heat affected zone (HAZ) due the welding and by nitrided layer. With the aid of SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and EDS (Energy Dispersive Scanning), we analyzed the fractured mechanisms. Several tests were carried out with times and temperatures to determine the best aging condition and the chosen temperature was 480 °C for 3 hours. The application of laser welding seems to be effective for joining the plates with loss in the yield strength or tensile strength less than 10 %, compared with the strength of maraging steel without welding. The analyses of the fractured surface showed that the rupture of the welded samples occurred in the <b>fused</b> <b>zone</b> region and has ductile nature, with formation of dimples for all heat treatment conditions. The welding and plasma nitriding process have not modified the type of typical fracture of the maraging steel. The life in fatigue was not affected by nitrided, however, they observed a reduction in fatigue life of welded material, compared with no soldering material. The results showed that aging heat treatments increased the mechanical properties of maraging steel both welded and plasma nitrided material, whit strength values about 2. 000 MPa and elongation nearly 8 %...|$|E
40|$|Monetary {{integration}} {{has been}} on the West African political agenda for a long time. It has been regarded as an important development strategy by for instance the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) where 15 states are organized. Eight ECOWAS countries have a monetary co-operation through the Franc Zone, which is a unique post-colonial relation between France and former French colonies. In West Africa the Zone is organized in Union Économic et Monetaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA). In 2000, the non-UEMOA countries in the ECOWAS signed a treaty which established the Second Monetary Zone (SMZ). The aim is to <b>fuse</b> the Franc <b>Zone</b> in the UEMOA and the SMZ into a common monetary zone {{within the framework of the}} ECOWAS. However, there are several obstacles to the realization of this initiative. The research question is: How can the process of developing a common West African currency be explained and what are the main obstacles to its development? In order to respond to this question, I employ three so-called approaches to New Regionalism: the World Order Approach (WOA), the New Regionalism Approach (NRA) and the New Regionalisms/New Realist Approach (NR/NRA). First, the analysis shows the existence of a diverse set of ideas and visions towards the common currency initiative, both among external and regional, state and non-state actors. There exist at least two formal West African regionalisms, spearheaded by the ECOWAS and the UEMOA. These actors need to co-ordinate their integrative strategies in order to realize the initiative. Recently, external actors as the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have supported the initiative. Second, the analysis reveals the importance of regional uniqueness. Two aspects of the regional context are the second economy; and conflicts and regional instability. The existence of the second economy and the non-state actors in the region are central, because the informal economy both initiated and complicated the common currency initiative. In order to succeed in the initiative, the second economy and the already existing trading networks in the region have to be taken into appropriate consideration. Regional conflicts as the ones in Côte d Ivoire and Liberia have wide-reaching implications for the region and complicate the formal regionalization initiative. Last, the use of European models of integration could be reduced. Both the initiative and the studies of it need a closer link to the African reality. In order to be a serious step towards development, the common currency initiative needs endeavored actors and strategies adapted to a West African context...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} analysis {{described in}} this paper has been performed within {{the activities of the}} FREEDAM project (FREE from DAMage steel connections), which is an RFCS project (Research Fund for Coal and Steel), granted by the European Community, devoted {{to the development of a}} new design strategy based on the employment of friction dampers in beam-to-column joints. In past, the application of dampers has been widely investigated within the development of supplemental energy dissipation strategies, with the aim to improve the energy dissipation capacity of the primary structure and to reduce the structural damage by concentrating the energy dissipation supply in <b>fuses</b> located in <b>zones</b> of the structure where high relative displacements are expected. Conversely, the strategy studied in the FREEDAM project is based on the application of damping devices, specifically friction dampers, under a new perspective. In fact, they are conceived as elements included in connections with the aim to completely substitute the traditional dissipative zones of MRFs, i. e. the beam ends. To this scope, beam-to-column joints are equipped with friction dampers constituted by steel plates and friction pads pre-loaded with high-strength bolts, that can be located either at the level of both flanges, or at the bottom flange level only, or on additional haunches which can be used to increase the lever arm of the damper. In particular, the connection studied in the FREEDAM project is realized as a modification of the classical detail of a Double Split Tee Joint (DST) where, in substitution of the bottom Tee element, a symmetrical friction damper is introduced which is realized pre-loading friction pads located between the webs of a couple of angles used to fasten the beam to the column and the beam flange or the lowev plate of an eventual beam hunch, which is slotted in order to allow the sliding of the damper. With this connecting system, under bending actions, the joint is forced to rotate around a rotation center located at the base of the upper T-stub web and the energy dissipation supply is provided by the alternate slippage of the lower beam flange on friction pads. In this way, provided that the steel components of the connection are properly over-strengthened, the joint resistance and the rotation capacity can be easily governed by calibrating the preload applied to the frictional interfaces and realizing slotted holes whose length provides an adequate stroke for the dissipative device. The main feature of this connection is that, even under the occurrence of destructive seismic events, the only damage is due to the consumption of the friction pads, while all the steel elements are completely preserved obtaining, in this way, a connection able to withstand destructive seismic events without any damage to the steel parts, namely a FREE from DAMage connection. Clearly, in order to accurately control the design of such a connection typology, the knowledge of the value of the friction coefficient of the material employed to realize the friction pads is of paramount importance. Therefore, among all the possible materials, it is necessary to select those able to develop high values of the friction coefficient and a stable behavior under cyclic loading conditions. In this paper, the main results of preliminary analyses devoted to select the best materials to be employed as friction pads in the FREEDAM connections are presented. To date, twelve tests on eight different materials combined with stainless steel plates have been realized. The tests performed, mainly devoted to evaluate the behavior of the friction interfaces in terms of static and kinetic friction coefficient and in terms of degradation, are inspired to the sliding test proposed by EN 1090 - 2 adopting the loading protocol suggested by the EN 12159 for the qualification of seismic devices. The initial value of the friction coefficient and its evolution during the tests, have been determined for the different materials by monitoring the values of the forces of the bolts used to apply the pre-load to the friction interface and the value of the sliding force. The obtained results are presented both in terms of force-displacement curves and in terms of friction coefficient, providing a comparison between the performances of the analyzed interfaces in terms of energy dissipation supply...|$|R
