40|$|Controversy exists {{with the}} use of the acromioclavicular <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> for the {{treatment}} of lateral-third clavicle fractures (Neer type II). This is thought to stem from problems associated with the <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> causing impingement symptoms, which can cause long-term limitation of movement and pain.

30|$|The mean {{follow-up}} {{period in}} this study was 23.5  months (20 – 26  months) after <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> fixation and an average of 19.9  months (17 – 22  months) from the day of <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> removal.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{outcomes}} and complications of locking or nonlocking clavicular <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> for fixation of unstable lateral clavicle fractures. All patients with unstable Neer type II lateral clavicle fractures were operated in our hospital from January 2011 to December 2012. The included participants received either locking or nonlocking clavicular <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> operations. Demographic data, medical records and radiographs were reviewed retrospectively. At the last follow-up, shoulder function was evaluated with Constant-Murley scoring system. Our findings suggest that locking clavicular hook plates are equally useful for treating unstable lateral clavicular fractures, but in face of complicated ones, the locking <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> would not get more benefits than nonlocking <b>hook</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E

30|$|The clavicular <b>hook</b> <b>plates</b> are pre-contoured {{plates with}} varying sizes and depths {{as well as}} side to fit {{different}} anatomy. After reduction in the acromioclavicular joint, the hook is placed under the acromion process posteriorly and the screws are used to fix the plate to lateral clavicle maintaining the reduction. The manufacturers of the plate recommend routine removal of the plate after 3  months to avert the complications of subacromial impingement and acromial osteolysis. Clavicular <b>hook</b> <b>plates</b> have been demonstrated {{to be an effective}} implant option for surgical treatment of Rockwood type III acromioclavicular dislocation but concerns have been raised about acromial osteolysis, subacromial impingement and even possibly rotator cuff injuries [13, 14, 15].|$|R

30|$|The {{functional}} {{outcome of}} shoulder following {{removal of the}} <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> improved significantly during subsequent follow-ups. The Constant Score after 12  weeks post <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> removal hook was on an average 60, primarily due to improving but painful shoulder motion and moderate pain. In this study, we did not allow the patients to attempt overhead abduction beyond 90 degrees, while <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> was in situ to avoid inadvertent damage to acromion and subsequent acromial osteolysis and subacromial bursitis which {{has been reported in}} the earlier studies on <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> fixation [26, 27]. There was a significant improvement in the Constant Score at 18  months post <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> removal in all the patients. There were 19 patients (57  %) with Constant Score above 90 at the last follow-up. All the patients had significant improvement in overhead abduction (beyond 120 °) and returned to active sports such as basketball, handball and kabaddi. The functional outcome was similarly excellent as seen in UCLA Scores at the last follow-up at around 2  years post-surgery. The ultimate goal of surgical intervention in this set of injuries was to facilitate return to their pre-injury level of active sports which was achieved in all the patients which is comparable to the results of earlier studies where <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> has been used [26]. The major disadvantages of <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> cited in earlier series have been repeat surgery, persistent shoulder pain, incomplete shoulder function, acromial osteolysis and acromioclavicular subluxation [27]. In our study, we had no surgical site infection, and in the early and midterm follow-up, there was no incidence of osteolysis, subluxation of acromioclavicular joint after <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> removal. There was no requirement of any repeat surgical intervention other than the removal of <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> itself. The concern of subacromial impingement was pertinent till the <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> was in situ. However, after plate removal, there was no clinicoradiological evidence of the same. The radiological assessment of a sound acromioclavicular joint can be done with stress radiographs and measurement of the coracoclavicular distance comparing with the contralateral side or an absolute value which should be 11 – 13  mm generally [28].|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the shoulder function after clavicular <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> fixation of acute acromioclavicular dislocations (Rockwood type III) in a population group consisting exclusively of high-demand military personnel. This prospective study was carried out at a tertiary care military orthopaedic centre during 2012 – 2013 using clavicular <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> for management of acromioclavicular injuries without coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction in 33 patients. All patients underwent routine implant removal after 16  weeks. The functional outcome was assessed at 3, 6 and 12  months after <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> removal and 2  years from the initial surgery using the Constant Murley and UCLA Scores. All the patients were male serving soldiers and had sustained acromioclavicular joint dislocation (Rockwood type III). Mean age of the patient group was 34.24  years (21 – 55  years). The mean follow-up period {{in this study was}} 23.5  months (20 – 26  months) after <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> fixation and an average of 19.9  months (17 – 22  months) after <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> removal. The average Constant Score at 3  months after <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> removal was 60.3 as compared to 83.7 and 90.3 at 6  months and 1  year, respectively, and an average of 91.8 at the last follow-up that was approximately 2  years after initial surgery which was statistically significant (p value < 0.05). The UCLA Score was an average of 15.27, 25.9 and 30.1 at 3, 6  months and 1  year, respectively, after removal of <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> which improved further an average of 32.3 at the last follow-up, which was also statistically significant (p value < 0.05). Clavicular <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> fixation without coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction is a good option for acute acromioclavicular dislocations producing excellent medium-term functional results in high-demand soldiers.|$|E

40|$|Fracture-dislocations of the {{proximal}} interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) remains a challenging injury to manage. For those that are unstable, a variety of surgical treatment have been reported, each with its pros and cons: 1. Open reduction and internal fixation, with a. Interfragmentary screws from either the dorsal or volar approach, b. Cerclage wiring 2. Hemi-hamate osteochondral grafting, using fixed with interfragmentary screws, 3. Volar-plate arthroplasty, 4.

40|$|Background/Aim. Acromioclavicular (AC) luxations {{most often}} affect athletes. The {{published}} results regarding {{the treatment of}} AC joint luxations vary. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, so {{there is still no}} consensus on the best method of treatment. The aim {{of this study was to}} review the results of a number of surgical approaches to stabilization of AC joint recorded over the span of five years. Methods. This study was based on the data acquired from the analysis of 28 patients with AC luxation surgically treated in the Clinical Center of Montenegro. One group of 16 patients underwent the traditional AO method (with transfixation of AC joint with Kirschner wire and Zuggurtung tension bands) or the Bosworth method (using the coracoclaviculartransfixation screw - Zugg-Bosw group). The second group of 12 patients underwent a newer techinque with the <b>Hook</b> <b>plate</b> (<b>Hook</b> <b>plate</b> group). Results. All the patients had AC luxation of higher degree, stage IV-VI acording to the Rockwood scale. The average age of the two groups was very similar, with 28 being the average age of the Zugg-Bosw group, and 25 of the <b>Hook</b> <b>plate</b> group. Most patients were males (82 %), injured mostly during athletic activity (75 %- 83 %). Complications were more common and more complex in the Zugg-Bosw group, with 2 early and 8 late comlications. There are only 3 late complications in the <b>Hook</b> <b>plate</b> group, but with no significant statistical difference (p = 0. 19; t = - 1. 34; df = 27). With respect to the subjective patient satisfaction following the treatment, the <b>Hook</b> <b>plate</b> group gave significantly better evaluations (4. 4 ± 0. 19) (p = 0. 007; t = 2. 95; df = 27). Constant score showed no significant statistical difference (p = 0. 078; t = 1. 8; df = 27). The <b>Hook</b> <b>plate</b> group had a better median score (90 ± 0. 18) with respect to the Zugg-Bosw group (85 ± 0. 40). Conclusion. The <b>Hook</b> <b>plate</b> method achieved somewhat better results, which indicate that this method is one of the ways to ensure a strong, stable fixation of the AC joint without transfixation. At the same time, this method does not inhibit the ligament healing and allows an early mobilisation...|$|E
30|$|It can be {{concluded}} that precontoured clavicular <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> is a good implant option {{to be considered for}} fixation of type III acromioclavicular dislocations without requiring any additional ligamentous procedures. The recommendation to apply this conclusion across all types of acromioclavicular dislocations would not be absolutely pertinent as this study primarily dealt with type III injuries. Young active athletic patients like soldiers with such injuries would definitely benefit with an early reduction and fixation with <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> followed by its timely removal.|$|E

30|$|The {{operative}} {{procedures were}} clearly described in all papers. Five studies included fixation using Kirschner wire or screw fixation methods, whilst one study used <b>hook</b> <b>plates</b> as {{the form of}} fixation [22]. All studies reported repair of coracoclavicular and acromioclavicular ligaments using sutures. The non-operative management adopted was poorly described. All subjects were immobilised using a sling of some description. However, Taft et al. [9] reported immobilising patients using a taping technique or cast, but did not specify the method of application. Immobilisation varied between the studies from 2  weeks [8] to 4  weeks [9]. The remaining papers reported immobilising patients until pain and symptoms had resolved. Following this, subjects commenced range of motion and/or strength rehabilitation programmes, {{but this was not}} described in detail in the studies. The follow-up period ranged from 32  months [21] to 10.8  years [9].|$|R
30|$|Although we {{were unable}} to find the source of {{heterogeneity}} by meta-regression and subgroup analysis (two different approaches, two different implant designs of LSF devices and the plate removal time after <b>hook</b> <b>plating),</b> several factors must be considered in clinical implementation. Firstly, there is either single [1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 20, 29, 34, 38, 43, 46, 47, 50] or double (V anatomic shape [24] with parallel [8, 18, 33, 40, 42, 55, 58, 59]) bundle LSF fixation, in which double bundles demonstrate higher function scores (CMS) and lower pain VAS. Within the double bundle groups, no significant differences regarding clinical or radiologic results have been found [24]. Secondly, arthroscopic techniques have recently been described in the treatment of acute AC dislocation [1, 9, 18, 29, 34, 40, 42, 43, 46, 50, 55, 59]. With the use of an arthroscopic approach, LSF seems to have higher pain VAS when compared to open LSF [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 24, 33, 38, 47, 58], but shows no differences in terms of function, outcomes or complication rates. For HP fixation, most studies used an open approach [7, 13, 17, 21, 23, 39, 41, 49, 56], with only one study using an arthroscopic approach [11]. However, after subgroup analysis, there were no differences in pain function and complication outcomes. As for the time of implant removal after initial surgery in the <b>hook</b> <b>plating</b> group, pain VAS was lower when the plate was removed within 3  months [2, 7, 18, 21, 23, 29, 39, 59], while the CMS function score was higher when the plate was removed after 3  months [10, 17, 25, 41, 49, 56] (Table  4). Therefore, the recommended time to remove the implant will depend on the symptoms of each individual patient. If there is persistent pain after surgery, the HP should be removed before 3  months. If the patient has no pain but limited shoulder function; the implant should not be removed prior to 3  months postoperatively.|$|R

The {{patients were}} followed up for a minimum period of 24  months after <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> fixation. The patients were subjected to radiographic assessment at 12  weeks, 6  months, 1 and 2  years which included the congruency of acromioclavicular joint and restoration of the coracoclavicular distance or any increase in the same at later follow-up examinations. The functional outcome was assessed using the Constant and Murley Score and UCLA Score with assessment at all follow-ups.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 16 patients (11 males, 5 females) who were diagnosed with Neer type 2 distal clavicle fractures and treated with <b>hook</b> <b>plate</b> fixation between 2013 and 2014. Mean age was 38 (range: 27 – 61), and mean follow-up time was 14. 3 (range: 12 – 18) months. Complications seen on radiographs were implant failure and subacromial osteolysis. The clinical results were evaluated with modified UCLA (University of California Los Angeles) scoring system. Results: Bone union was achieved in all patients at the end of the first 4 months.

40|$|Purpose: Fractures of {{the lateral}} {{end of the}} {{clavicle}} are relatively uncommon. These fractures are unstable due to the various deforming forces which act on the fragments {{as well as the}} small distal fracture fragment. At most times the deforming forces are not taken into consideration, and the fracture is not fixed securely. In this study, we assessed a fixation technique using the precontoured locking plates to find out whether it provided a stable fixation with good functional outcome. Methods: Totally, 32 patients with lateral end clavicle fracture (Neer's Type II) were included in the study. After the informed consent and preoperative investigations were obtained, open reduction and internal fixation was done using a 3. 5  mm precontoured superior locking plate with lateral extension under general anesthesia. Postoperative X-rays were done on day 1 and every 6 weeks after operation, until radiological union was achieved. The postoperative pain was assessed using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) on postoperative days 1, 2 and 10. Postoperatively arm pouch sling was given for 2 weeks followed by active mobilization. Patients were asked to do their daily routine work and avoid lifting heavy weights. The functional outcome was assessed at the end of 2 nd and 6 th months with the help of Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) scoring. Results: There were no intraoperative complications in the procedure. The mean VAS score on postoperative day 1 was found to be 5 which decreased to 3 on day 2 and 0 on day 10. The mean DASH score was calculated as 11. 63 at the end of postoperative month 2 and then 4. 6 at the end of month 6. There was one case of malunion in whom the overhead abduction was restricted but was not painful and was managed conservatively. Conclusion: The precontoured locking plates with lateral extension may be a good method to fix the fractures of the lateral end clavicle, which provide a stable fixation with good functional outcome with very few instances of stiffness and decreased range of motion of the shoulder with the <b>hook</b> <b>plates</b> and failure of fixation in screw and K-wire fixations.

40|$|The acromioclavicular {{dislocation}} is {{a frequent}} injury in sporting activities. For more than 2000 years a multiplicity of conservative and surgical treatments have been developed and recorded. Since 1856 over 70 surgical procedures have been documented. The injury is categorized according to Tossy and more detailed according to Rockwood. The diagnosis includes clinical examination, anamnesis and radiographic diagnostics. An ultrasound examination can be helpful for experienced practitioners. Further magnetographic and CAT scans should be considered for examining surrounding structures {{especially in regards to}} the rotary cuff. This paper presents the results in regards to a Tossy III injury and treatment with a anatomically adapted <b>hooked</b> <b>plate</b> (the Acro-Plate). Altogether 60 out of 79 patients returned for a follow-up evaluation. The average age of the patients is 37 years. The re-examination took place after 38, 3 months on average. In order to compare the results, the Taft-Score as well as the Constant Score were used. Nine patients encountered post surgical complications. One serious infection occurred due to premature plate removal. Sensitivity disruptions were observed once post op. On seven occasions it came to a seroma but could be treated conservatively. All in all 95 % of all patients were satisfied with the operation. While 23 patients complained about discomfort in regards to the plate, all patients were {{able to go back to}} work and 75 % of all patients had no complications whatsoever. In regards to pain, 95 % of the patients were pain-free while resting. Radiological imaging revealed that 10 % of the patients had a raise in the AC joint of more than 5 mm. The Taft score yielded an average of 10. 4 points from 12 possible points. 73 % of patients achieved good to very good results. According to the Constant and Murley score 80 % of the patients achieved excellent results and 97 % excellent and good results. In comparison to existing literature the examined group of patients has a comparable profile. The age and sex distribution as well as the accident mechanism correspond with most comparative studies. The complication rate is lower than with larger implants, particularly in regards to the infection rate, material loosening and incision length. The results after implantation are very good to good. In comparison to studies represented in the literature the results obtained are better and comparably well. In comparing surgical therapy and conservative treatment of acromioclavicular joint separations no clear commendation can be expressed according to the criteria of "evidence based medicine" (Baethis 2000). Conservative treatment generally leads to the elimination of procedural complications, however surgical therapy yield similar results in post-op examinations. In summary, the Acro-Plate shows yields good results in regard to acromioclavicular disorders, including fewer complications and the chance of earlyfunctional treatment...|$|R
