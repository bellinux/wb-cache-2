5|$|On {{the second}} <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a bronze bust, by Albin Polasek, of {{sculptor}} and muralist Frank Millet, {{who had also}} died on the Titanic.|$|E
5|$|The {{account that}} Yoko Ono banged {{her head on}} the <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> also disputed, by two of the nurses who attended.|$|E
50|$|In 1983, {{its first}} <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> a Trailways Bus station and its second <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> unused.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> used as {{the library}} and the second <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> the meeting room.|$|R
50|$|Laminate and vinyl <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> often {{confused}} with engineered wood <b>floors,</b> but <b>are</b> not; laminate uses {{an image of}} wood on its surface, while vinyl <b>flooring</b> <b>is</b> plastic formed to look like wood.|$|R
5|$|The {{first floor}} has {{numerous}} classrooms, auditorium spaces, {{and support services}} for students, such as tutoring, the writing center, and technology assistance. Also on the first <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a snack stop and a Starbucks. The second floor has the reference section, cartography (GIS Center), circulation, and numerous computer and printing labs. The third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> {{the home of the}} Medical Library, and includes study lounges as well as a resource center for students of the Honors College. The fourth floor houses the special collections department and university archives. The fifth <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the home of the School of Architecture Library, as well as the music and audiovisual collections. The sixth and seventh floors are strictly quiet floors, and contain the general book collection plus numerous student study lounges. The eighth floor contains the library's administration offices and technical services departments.|$|E
5|$|The second <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a folk museum with scale-model fishing boat, {{and other}} tools and items of {{cultural}} significance to Ikata on display year-round.|$|E
5|$|The third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a {{rest area}} {{offering}} a panorama {{view of the}} peninsula. Kirara-kan {{is connected to the}} Ikata Visitors House.|$|E
5000|$|Bamboo <b>flooring</b> <b>is</b> {{made from}} a fast-growing {{renewable}} [...] "timber" [...] (bamboo is actually a grass). It is natural anti-bacterial, water-resistant and extremely durable. DIY installation is easy, as bamboo <b>flooring</b> <b>is</b> available with tongue-and-groove technology familiar in hardwood/laminate alternatives. Bamboo <b>flooring</b> <b>is</b> often more expensive than laminate, though it is generally cheaper than traditional hardwood flooring. Some bamboo <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> less sustainable than others, as they contain the toxic substance formaldehyde (rather than natural-base adhesives).|$|R
50|$|Nightingale <b>floors</b> (uguisubari) , <b>were</b> <b>floors</b> {{designed}} to make a chirping sound when walked upon. These <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> used in the hallways of some temples and palaces, the most famous example being Nijo Castle, in Kyoto, Japan. Dry boards naturally creak under pressure, but these <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> designed so that the flooring nails rubbed against a jacket or clamp, causing chirping noises. The squeaking <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> used as a security device, assuring that none could sneak through the corridors undetected.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, {{the former}} {{warehouse}} and central carriageway {{of the ground}} <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> used for car parking and the former ground <b>floor</b> offices <b>was</b> used as a cafe. The upper <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> divided {{into a number of}} small tenancies.|$|R
5|$|Within the Schine Student Center is home {{to three}} gallery spaces. The Robert B Menschel Photography Gallery {{features}} work from professional photographers as well as students and local artists. On the third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the Panasci Lounge Art Hanging space for two dimensional spaces. This space can be reserved by students. The White Cube Gallery, also on the third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a student gallery that showcases work for the student body outside {{of the school of}} art and design.|$|E
5|$|At {{the front}} of the house, on the ground <b>floor,</b> <b>is</b> a reconstructed medieval shop front, from where the owner would have {{conducted}} his mercantile business. Behind this is the central hall, originally designed with an open hearth in the middle, but now fitted with a 14th-century Flemish chimney, plastered so as to resemble brickwork. A hallway runs along one side of the hall; hallways were a traditional feature of the period, although the fashion was eventually abandoned because of the difficulty of lighting them effectively. At the rear of the property is an inner private room, with a decorative ceiling. Beneath the house is an undercroft, or cellar, designed to store barrels of wine at a constant temperature; the brick <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> 18th-century in origin, however. This is an architectural feature found in several other English coastal and river medieval towns, including Winchester and London.|$|E
5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E
50|$|The building's ground <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> leased by the US Treasury Dept. from 1924-1935. The 10th-11th <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> the {{original}} {{location of the}} Arizona Club, including dining rooms, lounges, a library, and bedrooms for club members. When the Arizona Club {{moved out of the}} Luhrs Building in 1971, the upper <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> also converted to office floor space.|$|R
5000|$|Helland Center - The Helland Center {{is home to}} the Student Life Center. On {{the first}} <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> tables and chairs, a {{convenience}} store, and service desk.

On the third <b>floor</b> <b>are</b> the Student Health Center and student lockers.|$|R
50|$|The club {{had three}} floors {{at ground level}} was the {{reception}} where tapes and videos could be bought. The first <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> the chill out room where ice cold drinks and food were served, the second <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> the main dance floor and stage area for the PAs to play, and the third <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> a balcony overlooking the second floor. On most Friday nights the first <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> used as a second dance arena which had its own line up of DJs. The club's official capacity was 1,600.|$|R
5|$|On {{its walls}} {{are dozens of}} bronze plaques that {{indicate}} {{the locations of the}} remains of most of Mexico City's former archbishops, including Cardinal Ernesto Corripio y Ahumada. The <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> covered with small marble slabs covering niches containing the remains of other people.|$|E
5|$|The bin <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> {{where the}} grain is stored before being ground into flour. The sack hoist {{mechanism}} is housed on this floor, driven from the wooden crown wheel {{on the floor}} below by belt.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} a Floorless Coaster has one main {{difference}} from traditional steel roller coasters around the world: it has no floors between the seats. While a train is in the station, a <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing {{in front of it}} to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens, allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster. Aside from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions similar to B's Sitting Coasters.|$|E
50|$|In {{its first}} <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> a pool parlor and a club area; {{on the second}} <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> a large dance floor, an {{auditorium}} space, and an office and library.|$|R
50|$|Two of the Kordopulov House's four <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> made of stone. Seven inner {{staircases}} {{connect the}} floors and garrets {{and the two}} wooden <b>floors</b> <b>are</b> covered with motley rugs.|$|R
5000|$|The ground <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> {{accessible}} by water {{and was used}} for storage, while the first <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> dedicated to offices and an upper area contained about 160 living quarters.|$|R
5|$|The largest room on {{the first}} <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> the Withdrawing Room, {{situated}} above the Great Hall. It has an elaborate plaster ceiling, and the overmantel above the fireplace bears the arms of Queen Elizabeth I. The frieze of the Withdrawing Room incorporates shields of arms representing marriages of the Davenports.|$|E
5|$|The third <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a single, unparitioned {{room that}} was likely used for storage. The cellar of the jail has a chimney {{on the west}} that has several ovens, {{including}} a beehive oven, and was not partitioned except for the fieldstone foundation required to support the cells in the southeast corner.|$|E
5|$|A bronze-covered door, {{with relief}} panels {{depicting}} figures, opens onto the entrance hall. In Burges's time {{the door had}} a letterbox, {{in the form of}} Mercury, the messenger of the gods. The letterbox is now lost, but a contemporary copy is in the collection of The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum. The porch contains a white marble seat and column, and on the <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> a mosaic of Pinkie, a favourite poodle of Burges. Cartooned by H.W. Lonsdale, it resembles the cave canem floor at Pompei.|$|E
2500|$|The structure's {{interior}} <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> {{also made}} precast concrete. However, the <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> almost made of more than-traditional materials. [...] Late {{in the design}} process, GSA accountants estimated {{that the cost of}} precast concrete for the <b>flooring</b> would <b>be</b> exceptionally high, and GSA threatened to change the architectural plans. But after extensive discussions between GSA and Breuer, GSA relented. The plans were let to bid as designed, and the <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> fabricated for significantly less than estimated.|$|R
50|$|Inside, the <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> {{connected}} by wooden stairs. Most floors ranged from 450-700 square feet with very high ceilings. Top <b>floors</b> <b>were</b> often living quarters for shopkeepers and their family.|$|R
50|$|On {{the second}} <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> Caroline's bedroom, domed boudior, {{dressing}} room, bathroom, closets and her pink sitting room. also on this <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> a guest suite and the linen closet.|$|R
5|$|At {{ground level}} {{and inside the}} lobby, bas-reliefs depict {{the origins of the}} Price company. During the 1920s John M. Lyle, an {{influential}} architect of the Beaux-arts school, was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles, and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald to the construction of the Price Building. Each <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> symmetrically divided in two by a hallway, and a projection {{at the end of the}} building references the bow of a ship.|$|E
5|$|Based on Apollo 17 observations, {{the valley}} <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} a gently rolling plane. Boulders {{of various sizes}} and other geologic deposits are scattered throughout the valley. At the ALSEP lunar experiment deployment area, located west of the immediate landing site, the boulders average about four meters in size and are higher in concentration than {{in other areas of}} the valley.|$|E
5|$|In his {{documentary}} The Pervert's Guide to Cinema, Slavoj Žižek {{remarks that}} Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the {{three levels of}} the human mind that are postulated by Freudian psychoanalysis: the top floor would be the superego, where Bates' mother lives; the ground <b>floor</b> <b>is</b> then Bates' ego, where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' id. Žižek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>floor</b> plan <b>was</b> of {{lobby and}} mail grouping, {{the second floor}} {{consisted}} of the typewriter operators' department, the third <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> the mail department, the fourth <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> the mail room, and the fifth floor consisted of a restaurant and kitchen, balconies, and a conservatory.|$|R
50|$|Like many fraternal buildings, {{the upper}} <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> {{used for the}} lodge hall while the first <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> rented out. An 1880 map shows the first floor being {{occupied}} by The Armory.|$|R
50|$|A new double height atrium {{was created}} {{on the ground}} floor, and a new fifth and sixth <b>floor</b> <b>were</b> erected, while the seventh <b>floor</b> <b>was</b> {{extended}} as an open mezzanine. As a result, net lettable <b>floor</b> space <b>was</b> increased by 30%, from 12100 m2 to 15600 m2. Each <b>floor</b> can <b>be</b> subdivided into two spaces and the open balustrading has been replaced with partially glazed partitions.|$|R
