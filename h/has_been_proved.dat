5|$|The 260-day tzolk'in {{provided}} the basic cycle of Maya ceremony, and {{the foundations of}} Maya prophecy. No astronomical basis for this count <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proved,</b> {{and it may be}} that the 260-day count is based on the human gestation period. This is reinforced by the use of the tzolk'in to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy. The 260-day cycle repeated a series of 20-day-names, with a number from 1 to 13 prefixed to indicated where in the cycle a particular day occurred.|$|E
5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proved,</b> {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, he or she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature. Nevertheless, a person may defend himself or herself by proving that he or she was unaware of the contents {{and the nature of the}} contents of the document, and that he or she did not have reasonable cause to believe or suspect that the document was subversive. The ISA places a duty on any person, any office-bearer of an association, or any responsible member or agent of an organization who receives a subversive document to deliver it to a police officer without delay. Failure to do so without police authorization, or communicating the contents of such a document to others or publishing them is an offence.|$|E
5|$|The Sulphur Creek {{watershed}} {{has had a}} {{long history}} of water pollution, which can be attributed to residential development. While no raw sewage flows into the creek, the creek is contaminated by large quantities of urban runoff from impervious paved surfaces that collects toxins before pouring untreated into the creek. There are over four large storm drain outlets that pour directly into Sulphur Creek. Such untreated runoff has caused E. coli and Enterovirus to increasingly harm the creek and its remaining biodiversity. Channelization is also another factor, and standing water in the Sulphur Creek Reservoir has suffered eutrophication. The primary source of bacteria contamination is the largest tributary of Sulphur Creek, now mostly underground. The channel joins the creek not too far from its mouth. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proved</b> that 87 percent of the Sulphur Creek mainstem is severely degraded.|$|E

Nevertheless, purely real expressions of the solutions may be obtained using hypergeometric functions, or more elementarily in terms of trigonometric functions, specifically in terms of the cosine and arccosine functions.|$|E

25|$|Generally, {{sequence}} alignment means {{constructing a}} string from {{two or more}} given strings with the greatest similarity by adding, deleting letters, or adding a space for each string. The multiple sequence alignment problem is generally based on pairwise sequence alignment and currently, for pairwise sequence alignment problem, biologists can use dynamic programming approach to obtain its optimal solution. However, the multiple sequence alignment problem {{is still one of}} the intractable problems in bioinformatics, because finding the optimal solution of multiple sequence alignment <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proved</b> as a NP-complete problem so that only approximate optimal solution can be obtained.|$|E

25|$|It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proved</b> {{that climate}} change will affect Nicaragua {{sooner rather than later}} due to its {{geographic}} location in the traditional path of strong Atlantic tropical storms and hurricanes. Planning efforts in Nicaragua are directed towards adapting to wider climate variability including stronger storms in some years and more severe droughts in others, and higher temperatures that will provoke increased evaporation. This will lead to even drier years than the Nicaraguan agriculture had already suffered in past decades. Moreover, there is a high deforestation rate in Nicaragua that makes the country even more vulnerable to climate change induced flooding and landslides.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a theorem is a {{statement}} that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proved</b> {{on the basis of}} previously established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally deductive, in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is experimental.|$|E
25|$|However several {{writers and}} {{observers}} {{suggested that the}} ambushers of via Fani included a marksman. Sources such as the magazine l'espresso further suppose {{that he could have}} {{been a member of the}} Italian intelligence service and identify him as Giustino De Vuono, a marksman once part of the French Foreign Legion: according to their reconstruction, the 49 bullets found in the bodies of the bodyguards would come from his weapon. A witness reporting on 19 April 1978 at Rome's Prefecture declared that he had recognized De Vuono driving a green Austin Mini or Autobianchi A112 on the location of the massacre. De Vuono, who was affiliated to the 'Ndrangheta (Calabrian mafia), on that day was not in his usual residence in southern Paraguay (at the time under the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner). Several members of the Red Brigades declared that their weapons were acquired from the Calabrian gangland, amongst others; further, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>proved</b> that members of DC got in touch with Calabrian gangsters to obtain a help in the liberation of Moro.|$|E
