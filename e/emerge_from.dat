50|$|The text {{states that}} <b>from</b> the {{darkness}} <b>emerged</b> ether (or space). In turn, air <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> ether, fire <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> air, water <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> fire, and earth <b>emerged</b> <b>from</b> water. <b>From</b> earth <b>emerged</b> the egg, which split to create atmosphere and land. Between atmosphere and land emerged the divine person (Purusha) with one thousand heads, one thousand eyes, one thousand arms, and one thousand feet, who created death. The Brahman then created seven sons filled with truth, called Prajapatis. Out {{of the divine}} Purusha's mouth <b>emerged</b> the Brahmins, <b>from</b> the arms <b>emerged</b> the Kshatriyas, <b>from</b> the thighs <b>emerged</b> the Vaishyas and <b>from</b> the feet <b>emerged</b> the Shudras. <b>From</b> his mind <b>emerged</b> the moon, <b>from</b> the eyes came the sun, from his heart came the life-force (prana).|$|R

5|$|Values {{intersect}} {{with science}} in different ways. There are epistemic values that mainly guide the scientific research.

5|$|Adults are in {{reproductive}} diapause and overwinter in {{protected sites}} such as under tree barks, particularly of old, standing trees, hedgerows, lichen, and in forests or leaf litter. At early spring, they can be observed feeding on pollen and nectar of nearby flowers and particularly on Fabacae and Vicia spp.. Some B. rufimanus can survive during winter in larval or pupal diapause inside the seeds and terminate their diapause, finish their post-embryonic growth and <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the seeds after sowing.|$|E
5|$|Although toads {{are usually}} solitary animals, in the {{breeding}} season, {{large numbers of}} toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings {{in the water and}} later hatch out into tadpoles. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo metamorphosis into tiny toads. The juveniles <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the water and remain largely terrestrial {{for the rest of their}} lives.|$|E

The alien replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which ascends into space, as Barry bids Roy goodbye.|$|E

5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales provide some protection from predators as they <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the nest. In {{the case of}} the moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae are covered with soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make {{their way out of the}} nest after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor Domitian that {{assessing}} {{the true nature}} of Domitian's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources. Common threads nonetheless <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the available evidence. He appears to have lacked the natural charisma of his brother and father. He was prone to suspicion, displayed an odd, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humour, and often communicated in cryptic ways.|$|E

5|$|Hsu fled to Hong Kong {{and lived}} there from 1992 to 1996 {{while working in}} the garment industry. He started at least two {{companies}} there, both with vague charters. Aided by what others described as a magnetic personality, he prospered for a while, living in a luxury building. However the companies were dissolved in 1997 and 1998, and by 1998 Hong Kong courts had declared Hsu once again bankrupt.

5|$|Inflorescences are large, {{branched}} and borne {{among the}} leaves. The inflorescence {{consists of a}} main axis—the peduncle and the rachis—and a series of smaller branches, the rachillae. The rachillae, which bear the flowers, <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the rachis. The peduncle is the main stalk, connecting the rachis with the stem. Inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers, or are predominantly female with a few male flowers. Fruit usually {{have two or three}} seeds, although fewer or more are present in some species, and are usually brown, yellow, orange-brown or purple when mature.|$|E
5|$|Parasitoids {{have been}} found to parasitize B. rufimanus eggs: Chremylus rubiginosus and Triaspis thoracicus (family: Braconidae), and Dinarmus acutus (family: Pteromalidae).

Generalist predators on faba bean leaves such as spiders might feed on B. rufimanus eggs and contribute to their biological control although no data was found on their potential impact on the population size or growth.|$|E
