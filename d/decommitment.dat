The {{proposed}} Competitive Contract Net Protocol {{has been}} designed to facilitate a flexible cooperation in competitive multi-agent environments and to support automated or semi-automated negotiations in competitive domains. The protocol is based on FIPA standards. The protocol covers not only the phase of contracting the commitments, but also allows for a <b>decommitment</b> negotiation and contract termination. Thus, it consists of three phases: (i) a contracting phase, where conditions of agreement are concluded, (ii) an optional <b>decommitment</b> phase, where contract may be breached, and (iii) a contract termination phase, where the compliance with the concluded contract conditions is evaluated.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the unit commitment in multi-period {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) production planning, considering {{the possibility to}} trade power on the spot market. In CHP plants (units), generation of heat and power follows joint characteristics, which means that production planning for both heat and power must be done in coordination. We present an improved unit <b>decommitment</b> (IUD) algorithm that starts with an improved initial solution with less heat surplus so that the relative cost-efficiency of the plants can be determined more accurately. Then the subsequent <b>decommitment</b> procedures can decommit (switch off) the least cost-efficient plants properly. The improved initial solution for the committed plants is generated by a heuristic procedure. The heuristic procedure utilizes both the Lagrangian relaxation principle that relaxes the system-wide (heat and power) demand constraints and a linear relaxation of the ON/OFF states of the plants. We compare the IUD algorithm with realistic test data against a generic unit <b>decommitment</b> (UD) algorithm. Numerical results show that IUD is an overall improvement of UD. The solution quality of IUD is better than that of UD for almost all of tested cases.

To this end, in this thesis, we investigate bilateral negotiations between agents of service providers and consumers in such markets. Our main interest is in <b>decommitment</b> policies or rules that govern reneging on a commitment, which are essential for operating effectively in such dynamic settings. The work {{is divided into two}} main parts. In part I (chapters 3 - 8), we investigate how the <b>decommitment</b> policies, through the parties’ behaviour, affect the combined utility of all market participants. As a tool, we use decisions that parties make during their interaction. These decisions have previously been discussed in the law and economics literature, {{but this is the first}} empirical investigation of them in a dynamic service market setting. We also consider settings (for example, with incomplete information) that have not been addressed before. In particular, we take four of these decisions — performance, reliance, contract and selection — and consider them one by one in a variety of settings. We create a number of novel <b>decommitment</b> policies and increase the understanding of these decisions in electronic markets. In part II (chapters 9 - 11), we consider a buyer agent that engages in multiple negotiations with different seller agents concurrently and consider how <b>decommitment</b> policies should affect its behaviour. Specifically, we develop a detailed adaptive model for concurrent bilateral negotiation by extending the existing work in several directions. In particular, we pay special attention to choosing the opponents to negotiate with and choosing the number of negotiations to have concurrently, but we also address questions such as bilateral negotiation tactics and interconnected negotiations on different services.

40|$|Abstract. A {{cooperation}} of agents in competitive environments {{is more complicated}} than in collaborative ones. Both the replanning and reconfiguration play the crucial role in the cooperation and introduce a means for an implementation of a system flexibility. The concepts of commitments, decommitments with the penalties and subcontractions may facilitate effective reconfiguration and replanning. Agents in competitive environments are fully autonomous and selfinterested. Therefore the setting of penalties and the profit computation cannot be provided centrally. Both the costs and gain differ from agent to agent with respect to contracts already agreed and resources load. This paper proposes an acquaintance model for contracting in competitive environments and introduces possibilities of a reconfiguration in competitive environments as a means of a <b>decommitment</b> optimization with respect to resources load and profit maximization. The presented algorithm for contract price setting does not use any centralized knowledge and provides results corresponding to a realistic environment.

In addition to the dynamic environment, in such planning systems we also have to be aware of sometimes conflicting interests of different parties, rendering a centralized approach undesirable. In this paper we investigate two agent-based scheduling architectures where stakeholders are modelled as autonomous agents. We discuss this approach in the context of an interesting airport planning problem: the planning and scheduling of deicing and anti-icing activities. Based on our view that multi-agent scheduling is scheduling combined with agent coordination, these two architectures apply different mechanisms to coordinate the competition of agents over scarce resources: one mechanism based on <b>decommitment</b> penalties, and one based on a more traditional (Vickrey) auction. Experiments show that the auction-based mechanism best respects the preferences of the individual agents, whereas the <b>decommitment</b> mechanism ensures a fairer distribution of delay over the agents. ...|$|E
40|$|Unit Commitment (UC) is a {{term used}} for the {{strategic}} choice whereby the available power plants have to be on-line every time. Most UC models described in the literature are specifically designed for the power utilities. They are typical short-term models for relatively small power-systems. Apart from practical use in the utilities themselves, UC is also implemented in the broader context of electricity-generation modelling. For these purposes, however, the power systems can be much larger and the time scale more extended. Since UC is only a minor part of these models, the calculation time dedicated to UC has to be limited, thereby possibly sacrificing somewhat on accuracy. Two methods are compared. Unit <b>Decommitment</b> (UD), which is considered completely accurate and Advanced Priority Listing, which is less accurate but also less complicated.

The time complexity of DP-RSC 1 is proportional to the number of generating units in the system, the number of periods over the planning horizon and the time for solving a single-period economic dispatch problem. We have compared the DP-RSC 1 algorithm with realistic power plants against the unit <b>decommitment</b> algorithm and the traditional priority listing method. The results show that the DP-RSC 1 algorithm gives somewhat more accurate results (0. 08 - 0. 5 % on average, maximum 10 % for the individual sub-case) and executes 3 - 5 times faster on average than the unit <b>decommitment</b> algorithm.

The e ciency of such protocols depends heavily on how the penalties are decided. In this paper, dif-ferent leveled commitment protocols and their parameterizations are experimentally compared in sequences of multiple contracts. In the di erent experiments, the agents are of di erent types: self-interested or social welfare maximizing, and they can carry out game-theoretic lookahead or be myopic. Several meeting technologies, ways of set-ting the contract price, and ways of setting and increasing the penalties are compared. Surprisingly, self-interested myopic agents reach a higher social welfare quicker than cooperative myopic agents when <b>decommitment</b> penalties are low. The social welfare in settings with agents that perform lookahead does not vary as much with the de-commitment penalty as the social welfare in settings that consist of myopic agents.

40|$|Abstract. Resource {{scheduling}} {{problems with}} incomplete information and environment {{changes have been}} studied for decades. The {{vast majority of the}} research efforts in the scheduling problems under uncertainty assume a central authority with a global objective of maximizing the resource usage. In real-life scheduling problems, in addition to the dynamic environment, sometimes conflicting interests of different parties renders a centralized approach undesirable. Applying multi-agent approaches in resource scheduling overcomes the restrictions associated with traditional static centralized scheduling. This paper studies a multi-agent scheduling system {{in the context of an}} interesting airport planning problem: the planning and scheduling of deicing and anti-icing activities. In this application domain, self-interested aircraft agents have an incentive to reserve a deicing resource as early as possible, leading to sub-optimal schedules. To counter this effect, we propose the use of <b>decommitment</b> penalties, forcing agents to reserve the deicing resources at a later time point, which results in a better overall schedule. This paper investigates the effects of agents learning an ‘optimal ’ strategy in this context. To learn an ‘optimal ’ strategy, we apply genetic algorithms to train a neural network, the agent use to decide when to reserve the deicing resource. Experiments show that the neural-evolution algorithm outperforms the derived strategy based on simplified cost estimation in the <b>decommitment</b> penalties mechanism, which in turn significantly improve the efficiency and fairness compared with naive First Come, First Served approach. ...|$|E
