5|$|Protected against double jeopardy, Bryant and Milam {{struck a}} deal with Look {{magazine}} in 1956 to tell their story to journalist William Bradford Huie for between $3,600 and $4,000. The interview took place in the law firm of the attorneys who had defended Bryant and Milam. Huie did not ask the questions; Bryant and Milam's own attorneys did. Neither attorney had heard their clients' accounts of the murder before. According to Huie, the older Milam was more articulate and sure of himself than the younger Bryant. Milam admitted to shooting Till and neither of them believed they were guilty or that they had <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} not <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong,</b> Bart {{decides to}} run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While {{wandering}} the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, the Coast Guard cutter Chase took over, escorting the KD II to San Diego. Along {{the way the}} {{investigation}} continued. The Coast Guard reported that the four-man crew was cooperative with {{the investigation}}, largely sitting back and watching television in the lounge. Since they claimed not to have finned the sharks themselves, they believed they had not <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> Ship's records revealed that the KD II had met fishing vessels, primarily Korean longline fishing boats, at prearranged locations {{on the high seas}} near the Fiji and Solomon Islands and bought fins from them for a total of $250,000. On an earlier voyage that summer, the ship had made $6 million from shark fins obtained the same way. Korean-language records from a broker on board indicated an ongoing operation, giving the names of other ships involved. The refrigeration unit on board had broken before the ship had left Honolulu, and the fins were out on deck in an attempt to dry them out and reduce the odor.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} the racism issue, Ponting denied he had <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> by {{singularly}} reporting Harbhajan. Ponting stated that he was obligated to refer any incidents of racism to officials, as it was widely agreed among the cricket community that racism is unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|One {{question}} arising {{early in}} the story is why God rejects Cain's sacrifice, since Cain never received instructions about how to sacrifice correctly, nor had he <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong,</b> and why God then admonishes Cain with a warning about sin. The Midrash suggest that although Abel brought the best meat from his flock, Cain did not set aside for God {{the best of his}} harvest.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, Cooper and Fazio {{argued that}} dissonance {{was caused by}} {{aversive}} consequences, rather than inconsistency. According to this interpretation, the belief that lying is wrong and hurtful, not the inconsistency between cognitions, is what makes people feel bad. Subsequent research, however, found that people experience dissonance even when {{they feel they have}} not <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> For example, Harmon-Jones and colleagues showed that people experience dissonance even when the consequences of their statements are beneficial—as when they convince sexually active students to use condoms, when they, themselves are not using condoms.|$|E

25|$|On 22 April 2010, {{following}} revellations by {{an internal}} whistle blower and {{investigation by the}} NRL, Storm officials revealed that the club had committed serious and systematic breaches of the salary cap regulations between 2006 and 2010 by running a well-organized dual contract and bookkeeping system that concealed a total of $3.78million in payments made to players outside of the salary cap from the NRL. This included: $303,000 in 2006, $459,000 in 2007, $957,000 in 2008, $1.021million in 2009 and $1.04million in 2010. As a result, the club was stripped of the 2007 and 2009 premierships, 2006–2008 minor premierships and the following year, the 2010 World Club Challenge trophy. They were also fined a then Australian sporting record of $1.689million ($1.1million in NRL prize money which was equally distributed between the remaining 15 clubs, $89,000 in prize money from the World Club Challenge which was distributed to the Leeds Rhinos, and a maximum of $500,000 for breaching the salary cap regulations). In addition they were ordered to cut their payroll by $1.0125million, deducted all eight premiership points received during the 2010 season and barred from receiving premiership points {{for the remainder of}} the 2010 season. The points penalty meant that the club won the 2010 wooden spoon. The former directors attempted unsuccessful legal action against the penalties which collapsed, and the club also had to pay the NRLs legal costs. The matter was also referred to ASIC, the Australian Tax Office, the Victorian State Revenue Office, and the Victoria Police to investigate possible fraud however by May 2011 these investigations were closed. The players themselves were found to have not <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> during this time so individual awards are recognised in addition, the players were still eligible for Test/State of Origin selection.|$|E
500|$|Mr. Arakawa and I {{decided that}} we would go down and simply tell him [...] that we've come {{to tell you to}} your face that we would pay you if we thought we were liable, but we had done our {{homework}} and we were not prepared to pay anything because we hadn't <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> We just wanted to essentially look him in the face and tell him that. It seemed the honorable thing to do.|$|E
500|$|Although he did {{not believe}} Garrard had {{personally}} <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong,</b> Logan formally protested the outcome of the election to Kentucky Attorney General John Breckinridge. Breckinridge refused to render an official decision on the matter, claiming that neither the constitution nor the laws of the state empowered him to do so. Privately, however, he expressed his opinion that Logan had been legally elected. Logan then appealed to the state senate, which was given the authority to intervene in disputed elections. In November 1796, the Senate opined that the law giving them that authority was unconstitutional because it did not promote the [...] "peace and welfare" [...] of the state. State senator Green Clay was the primary proponent of this line of reasoning. By this time, Garrard had been serving as governor for five months, and Logan abandoned the quest to unseat him.|$|E

500|$|Webber {{said he had}} minor {{cuts and}} bruises after his lap nine {{accident}} with Kovalainen. He said he was unsure about Kovalainen's mindset and thought that the driver {{would allow him to}} get ahead. Nevertheless, he did not appropriation blame onto Kovalainen and said the difference between the braking capabilities of both cars caught him out by surprise. Webber later admitted that he misjudged how early Kovalainen would brake for the corner but felt the latter had moved more than once while defending the position. Kovalainen claimed that he had not <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong</b> and blamed Webber for causing the crash. Both drivers were transported to the circuit's medical centre. The incident was considered by many commentators to be similar to his accidents in the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans when his Mercedes-Benz CLR became twice airborne down the Mulsanne Straight. BBC pundit and former driver David Coulthard said of the crash: [...] "Motor racing has just seen one of its luckiest days. That could have been a very, very bad incident." ...|$|E
500|$|The Australian {{press and}} cricket {{officials}} immediately condemned the riot, which dominated {{the front pages}} of the local newspapers, even though the infamous bushranger Ned Kelly and his gang had raided Jerilderie on the same weekend. The local media were united in their disgust at the scenes of tumult, fearing a public relations disaster would erupt in England. [...] The Sydney Morning Herald called the riot [...] "a national humiliation", and that it [...] "would remain a blot upon the colony for some years to come". They accused those involved in gambling of inciting [...] "larrikins" [...] and [...] "roughs" [...] to storm the field and attack the Englishmen. [...] However, they also suggested that some of the blame should be put on one of the English professionals, who [...] "made use of a grossly insulting remark to the crowd about their being nothing but 'sons of convicts'". Barton defended the Englishmen and Coulthard, saying that none had <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> He claimed that Emmett and Ulyett were incapable of insulting the Australians in such a way.|$|E
500|$|This Is What the Truth Feels Like {{features}} {{a range of}} genres; including pop, reggae, disco and dancehall, R, hip hop and [...] "punky" [...] electro-pop music. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly viewed it as [...] "an album so directly torn from Stefani's recent, much-documented romantic upheavals {{that it could be}} called 'The Ballad of Blake and Gavin". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic added that: [...] "Stefani spends roughly half of the record singing breezy songs of liberation." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented: [...] "While an artist converting personal tragedy into creative capital is hardly new, the nakedness with which Stefani assesses the ruins of her relationship is stark, especially compared to the self-proclaimed guilty pleasures of Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape." [...] On writing about both relationships, Stefani claimed: [...] "I don't have any secrets; I don't have anything to hide. I haven't <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong.</b> I'm happy to share my story. [...] is really the only record I've written that's mostly happy; all the others are about heartbreak. And there's some of that on here—it needed that, to make the rest feel as good as it feels." ...|$|E

500|$|None of {{the columns}} after Dunne joined The American Magazine {{attracted}} the attention the earlier ones had, but Mr. Dooley continued {{to comment on the}} issues of the day. [...] Andrew Carnegie was a repeated target, as was John D. Rockefeller, whom Dooley summed up with [...] "he never <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>wrong,</b> save in the way of business" [...] In 1909, during the debates over the Payne–Aldrich Tariff, Dunne examined the bill and came out of it with an exotic item called [...] "divvy-divvy", which Mr. Dooley allowed, [...] "was let in as a compliment to [...] Senator Aldrich. It's his motto." [...] A seventh Dooley book was published in 1910, but given disappointing sales, the publishers abandoned plans for another in 1911. Although Dunne was a strong supporter of Roosevelt in the contentious 1912 presidential election, Mr. Dooley retained his customary above-the-fray attitude, mocking Roosevelt's excited oratory with Dooley feeling there was a large fire somewhere, a mystery solved when he opens the newspaper and learns [...] "much to my relief, that it was not my pants but the Republic that was on fire".|$|E
2500|$|In January 2014, it was {{reported}} that McDonald's was accused of having used a series of tax maneuvers to avoid taxes in France.
