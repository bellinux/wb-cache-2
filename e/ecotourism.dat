5|$|<b>Ecotourism</b> setups {{are being}} used to {{generate}} public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar, {{while at the same time}} generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. Audits done in Africa have shown that <b>ecotourism</b> has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar <b>ecotourism</b> is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if <b>ecotourism</b> is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or how new ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.|$|E
5|$|The pink whipray is {{valuable}} to <b>ecotourism</b> at {{sites in the}} Maldives, French Polynesia, and elsewhere; they are attracted to visitors in large numbers {{by the promise of}} food. The government of the Maldives has taken steps to preserve ray <b>ecotourism</b> by banning all exports of ray products in 1995. In 2005, stingray <b>ecotourism</b> at Moorea brought in over €500,000. However, a 2008 study of Moorea whiprays found a negative effect of <b>ecotourism</b> in the form of bite and impact injuries, stemming from artificially high ray density and interactions with boat traffic at the feeding sites. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the pink whipray as Vulnerable overall. Although the species has a wide distribution that includes refuge regions with few conservation threats such as the population off northern Australia. By contrast the Southeast Asian population is heavily fished.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of the present state and regional policy is to carefully combine tourism development in the area with the preservation of its natural and cultural heritage. <b>Ecotourism</b> poses an ideal solution, since {{it has the potential}} of bringing about the desired balance between socio-economic development and environmental protection. Specific objectives of <b>ecotourism</b> development include reviving traditional activities such as small-scale farming and stock-raising, as well as establishing a network of communities of chamois biotopes.|$|E
5|$|Debt relief {{may help}} Madagascar protect its biodiversity. With the {{political}} crisis in 2009, illegal logging has proliferated and now threatens rainforests in the northeast, including its lemur inhabitants and the <b>ecotourism</b> {{that the local}} communities rely upon.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ecotourism</b> has a {{large portion}} of the tourism market in Virginia Beach. There are many eco-adventures {{companies}} which offer tours on the land and on the water. Coyotes, foxes and bobcats can be seen inland of Virginia Beach in False Cape State Park.|$|E
5|$|In Chile, the Alfaguara project {{combines}} {{conservation measures}} {{for the population}} of blue whales feeding off Chiloé Island with whale watching and other <b>ecotourism</b> activities that bring economic benefits to the local people.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have drawn}} much {{attention}} to Madagascar and its endangered species. In this capacity, they act as flagship species, the most notable {{of which is the}} ring-tailed lemur, which is considered an icon of the country. The presence of lemurs in national parks helps drive <b>ecotourism,</b> which especially helps local communities living {{in the vicinity of the}} national parks, since it offers employment opportunities and the community receives half of the park entrance fees. In the case of Ranomafana National Park, job opportunities and other revenue from long-term research can rival that of <b>ecotourism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sabah has {{abundant}} natural resources, and {{its economy}} is strongly export-oriented. Its primary exports include oil, gas, timber and palm oil. The other major industries are agriculture and <b>ecotourism.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{park has}} sub-Himalayan belt {{geographical}} and ecological characteristics. An <b>ecotourism</b> destination, it contains 488 {{different species of}} plants and a diverse variety of fauna. The increase in tourist activities, among other problems, continues to present a serious challenge to the park's ecological balance.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the main}} focus is {{protection}} of wildlife, the reserve management has also encouraged <b>ecotourism.</b> In 1993, a training course covering natural history, visitor management and park interpretation was introduced to train nature guides. A second course followed in 1995 which recruited more guides for the same purpose. This allowed {{the staff of the}} reserve, previously preoccupied with guiding the visitors, to carry out management activities uninterrupted. Additionally, the Indian government has organised workshops on <b>ecotourism</b> in Corbett National Park and Garhwal region to ensure that the local citizens profit from tourism while the park remains protected.|$|E
5|$|Miri is {{the main}} tourist gateway to Gunung Mulu National Park, Loagan Bunut National Park, Lambir Hills National Park, Niah National Park and Miri-Sibuti Coral Reef National Park. The Gunung Mulu National Park with its Sarawak Chamber {{is one of the}} {{favourite}} <b>ecotourism</b> destinations. Miri is also the birthplace of the Malaysian petroleum industry. Other major industries in the city include timber, oil palm and tourism.|$|E
5|$|Use {{of the sea}} for leisure {{developed}} {{in the nineteenth century}} and became a significant industry in the twentieth century. Maritime leisure activities are varied and include self-organized trips cruising, yachting, powerboat racing and fishing; commercially organized voyages on cruise ships; and trips on smaller vessels for <b>ecotourism</b> such as whale watching and coastal birdwatching.|$|E
5|$|Weh Island is {{also known}} for <b>ecotourism.</b> Underwater diving, hiking through the {{volcanic}} mountain and beach resorts are the main attractions. A small village, Iboih, {{is known as a}} location for scuba diving. A few meters from Iboih is the Rubiah islet that is known for its coral reefs. There are also several dive operators in Gapang.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{and tourism}} {{now account for}} much of the area's economy. The rugged natural scenery, sense of isolation, and natural attractions such as Cathedral Caves makes the Catlins a popular {{destination}} for weekend trips by people from Dunedin and Invercargill, the two nearest cities. A large number of cribs (holiday cottages) occur at places such as Jack's Bay and Pounawea. <b>Ecotourism</b> is becoming increasingly important to the area's economy, with many of the visitors coming from overseas. Tourism added an estimated $2.4 million to the region's economy in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} birds are {{economically}} important as food for human consumption and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds (poultry and game) being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers. Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird excrement) is harvested {{for use as a}} fertiliser. Birds prominently figure throughout human culture. About 120–130 species have become extinct due to human activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway to protect them. Recreational birdwatching {{is an important part of}} the <b>ecotourism</b> industry.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} in the area since around 1350 AD. Prior to European settlement, the region was sparsely {{inhabited}} by nomadic groups of Māori, most of whom lived close to river mouths. In the early days of European settlement the area was frequented by whalers and sealers, and saw milling became a major local industry from the mid-19th century until the 1930s. <b>Ecotourism</b> has become of growing importance in the Catlins economy, which otherwise relies heavily on dairy farming and fishing.|$|E
5|$|Ratanakiri's tourist {{industry}} has rapidly expanded in recent years: {{visits to the}} province increased from 6,000 in 2002 to 105,000 in 2008 and 118,000 in 2011. The region's tourism development strategy focuses on encouraging <b>ecotourism.</b> Increasing tourism in Ratanakiri has been problematic because local communities receive very little income from tourism and because guides sometimes bring tourists to villages without residents' consent, disrupting traditional ways of life. A few initiatives have sought to address these issues: a provincial tourism steering committee aims to ensure that tourism is non-destructive, and some programs provide English and tourism skills to indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|The contested 2001 presidential {{elections}} in which then-mayor of Antananarivo, Marc Ravalomanana, eventually emerged victorious, caused a seven-month standoff in 2002 between supporters of Ravalomanana and Ratsiraka. The negative {{economic impact of}} the political crisis was gradually overcome by Ravalomanana's progressive economic and political policies, which encouraged investments in education and <b>ecotourism,</b> facilitated foreign direct investment, and cultivated trading partnerships both regionally and internationally. National GDP grew at an average rate of 7percent per year under his administration. In the later half of his second term, Ravalomanana was criticised by domestic and international observers who accused him of increasing authoritarianism and corruption.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} of human {{presence in the}} area is dated between 17,000 and 10,000 years ago. The area of the park has been sparsely populated throughout historical times, however from the 17th to the 19th century the local communities of Zagori acquired an autonomous status, flourished economically due to increased trade, and became a major center of folk medicine. In recent decades, <b>ecotourism</b> {{is seen as a}} remedy to the economic decline of heavily depopulated local settlements, while preserving the natural environment and local architecture.|$|E
5|$|The tourism {{industry}} attracts millions of visitors each year with attractions ranging from Space Center Houston {{to the bay}} itself. <b>Ecotourism,</b> in particular, is a growing sector with destinations such as the Armand Bayou Nature Center. Biotechnology, which already employs nearly 3000 workers in the area, is a smaller but growing industry in the area enabled {{in large part by}} JSC and the Texas Medical Center in Houston. Commercial fishing is one the older industries in the region and is still a significant economic sector.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction. A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species or, in some cases, fear it. Today, this rockfowl {{is considered one of}} Africa’s most desirable birds by birders and is a symbol of <b>ecotourism</b> across its range.|$|E
5|$|Gregarious in nature, {{the pink}} whipray {{has been known}} to form large active and resting aggregations, and {{associate}} with other large ray species. It preys mainly on prawns, but also consumes other benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. This species is aplacental viviparous, in which the unborn young are nourished by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Across much of its range, substantial numbers of pink whiprays are caught incidentally by a variety of fishing gear and marketed for meat, skin, and cartilage. It is also of importance to <b>ecotourism,</b> being attracted to visitors with bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, due to its wide distribution that includes relatively protected areas, such as northern Australia. However, its population in Southeast Asia is likely declining under heavy fishing pressure, and there it has been assessed as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|International {{treaties}} may {{be necessary}} for such objectives as the setting up of marine reserves. Another international agreement, the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, protects animals that migrate across the globe and need protection {{in more than one}} country. However, the protection of habitats needs {{to take into account the}} needs of the local residents for food, fuel and other resources. Even where legislation protects the environment, a lack of enforcement often prevents effective protection. Faced with food shortage, a farmer is likely to plough up a level patch of ground despite it being the last suitable habitat for an endangered species such as the San Quintin kangaroo rat, and even kill the animal as a pest. In this regard, it is desirable to educate the community on the uniqueness of their flora and fauna and the benefits of <b>ecotourism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Madagascar {{belongs to}} the group of least {{developed}} countries, according to the United Nations. Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state. The majority of the population adheres to traditional beliefs, Christianity, or an amalgamation of both. <b>Ecotourism</b> and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. , the economy has been weakened by the 2009–2013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low {{for the majority of the}} Malagasy population.|$|E
5|$|Several {{apparently}} unprovoked {{attacks on}} humans {{have been attributed}} to the sicklefin lemon shark. Due to its formidable size and teeth, it is regarded as potentially dangerous, and certainly this species has been known to defend itself quickly and vigorously if touched, speared, or otherwise provoked or alarmed. Once agitated, this shark can be a persistent adversary; in one case, a shark forced a swimmer to seek refuge atop a coral head, and circled for hours before giving up. However, observations by divers show that normally this shark is shy and hesitant to approach, even when presented with bait. Often, the shark will move away when a diver enters visual range. Young sharks are reportedly more aggressive and inquisitive than the adults. At Moorea, sicklefin lemon sharks are the main attraction of daily shark-feeding <b>ecotourism</b> dives. This shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed in public aquariums.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN has {{recommended}} co-operation between countries across the cheetah's range to minimise {{the conflict between}} cheetahs and human beings. A 2016 study showed that <b>ecotourism</b> can have a significantly {{positive impact on the}} conservation of the cheetah. Although the requirement of space for the habitat would have to be compromised in most cases, establishment of private reserves for cheetahs and ensuring the absence of predators and poachers could be a successful conservation measure. Additionally, the financial benefits accrued and the awareness generated can further aid the cause of the cheetah. At the same time, the animals should not be unnecessarily handled or disturbed, as cheetahs are particularly sensitive to human interference.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the Caribbean reef shark as Near Threatened; its population has declined off Belize and Cuba from overfishing and exploitation continues in other regions. They are also {{threatened by the}} degradation and destruction of their coral reef habitat. Commercial fishing for this species is prohibited in United States waters. They are protected in the Bahamas due to their significance to <b>ecotourism,</b> {{as well as in}} a number of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) off Brazil and elsewhere. However, enforcement against illegal fishing is lacking in some of these reserves, and many areas in which this species is abundant are not protected.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} peoples of Taiwan face {{economic and social}} barriers, including a high unemployment rate and substandard education. Since the early 1980s, many aboriginal groups have been actively seeking {{a higher degree of}} political self-determination and economic development. The revival of ethnic pride is expressed in many ways by aborigines, including the incorporation of elements of their culture into commercially successful pop music. Efforts are under way in indigenous communities to revive traditional cultural practices and preserve their traditional languages. The Austronesian Cultural Festival in Taitung City is one means by which community members promote aboriginal culture. In addition, several aboriginal communities have become extensively involved in the tourism and <b>ecotourism</b> industries with the goal of achieving increased economic self-reliance and preserving their culture.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} natural attractions near Moncton. Two major {{national}} parks, Fundy National Park and Kouchibouguac National Park, are within a one-hour drive of the city. The warmest salt water beaches north of Virginia {{can be found}} on the Northumberland Strait, only 15minutes away at Parlee Beach in the nearby town of Shediac. New Brunswick's signature natural attraction, the Hopewell Rocks, are a half-hour's drive down the Petitcodiac river valley. Cape Enrage, located near Alma, includes a historic lighthouse, fossil cliffs, scenic vistas, and adventure tourism. The Sackville Waterfowl Park includes nature trails, a boardwalk over a freshwater marsh, and waterfowl viewing platforms. Other nearby attractions (within one hour of the city) include The Cape Jourimain National Wildlife Preserve, La Dune de Bouctouche Eco-Centre, (an <b>ecotourism</b> site and beach) and the Joggins Fossil Cliffs in Nova Scotia; a UNESCO world heritage site.|$|E
5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} nocturnal and {{spend most of}} the day resting {{motionless}} on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. The zebra shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of <b>ecotourism</b> dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.|$|E
5|$|Since beetles form such a {{large part}} of the world's biodiversity, their {{conservation}} is important, and equally, loss of habitat and biodiversity is essentially certain to impact on beetles. Unfortunately, with exceptions for groups such as ladybirds and fireflies, beetles as a whole have a less positive image than other insect groups like the butterflies: many are indeed pests, and others arouse disgust. Many species of beetles have very specific habitats and long life cycles that make them vulnerable. Some species are highly threatened while others are already feared extinct. Island species tend to be more susceptible as in the case of Helictopleurus undatus of Madagascar which is thought to have gone extinct during the late 20th century. Conservationists have attempted to arouse a liking for beetles with flagship species like the stag beetle, Lucanus cervus, and tiger beetles (Cicindelidae). In Japan the Genji firefly, Luciola cruciata, is extremely popular, and in South Africa the Addo elephant dung beetle offers promise for broadening <b>ecotourism</b> beyond the big five tourist mammal species. Popular dislike of pest beetles, too, can be turned into public interest in insects, as can unusual ecological adaptations of species like the fairy shrimp hunting beetle, Cicinis bruchi.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} is {{considered}} to be vulnerable due to habitat destruction, its isolated populations, collection of adults, predation, and a low breeding success rate. Its habitat is being destroyed to create large agricultural fields and cocoa plantations, as well as for logging and slash-and-burn agriculture. Due to the highly specialized requirements for its habitat, its population is very fragmented, and the species is believed to be naturally rare. Competition for its nesting sites is a result of these strict requirements and can lead to infanticide. Its estimated population is between 2,500 and 10,000 individuals, though it is believed that the population is {{at the lower end of}} the estimate. However, due to the inaccessibility of some parts of its range, it is also possible that this species is more common than believed. The population of some of these colonies is reaching the minimum levels needed for long-term viability. It also falls victim to spring traps set for mammals by hunters. However, a more serious threat to its numbers was the widespread collection of rockfowl for display in zoos in the 1950s and 1960s. There is a risk that it will be negatively affected by <b>ecotourism</b> due to disturbances in its daily routine if proper viewing procedures are not followed.|$|E
5|$|Although still {{abundant}} at Cocos Island {{and other}} relatively pristine sites, grey reef sharks {{are susceptible to}} localized depletion due to their slow reproductive rate, specific habitat requirements, and tendency to stay within a certain area. The IUCN has assessed the grey reef shark as Near Threatened; this shark is taken by multispecies fisheries {{in many parts of}} its range and used for various products such as shark fin soup and fishmeal. Another threat is the continuing degradation of coral reefs from human development. There is evidence of substantial declines in some populations. Anderson et al. (1998) reported, in the Chagos Archipelago, grey reef shark numbers in 1996 had fallen to 14% of 1970s levels. Robbins et al. (2006) found grey reef shark populations in Great Barrier Reef fishing zones had declined by 97% compared to no-entry zones (boats are not allowed). In addition, no-take zones (boats are allowed but fishing is prohibited) had the same levels of depletion as fishing zones, illustrating the severe effect of poaching. Projections suggested the shark population would fall to 0.1% of pre-exploitation levels within 20 years without additional conservation measures. One possible avenue for conservation is <b>ecotourism,</b> as grey reef sharks are suitable for shark-watching ventures, and profitable diving sites now enjoy protection in many countries, such as the Maldives.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{signed the}} Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993, {{and became a}} party to the {{convention}} on 24 June 1994. It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 16 April 1998. The country is megadiverse with a high number of species and high levels of endemism. It is estimated to contain 20percent of the world's animal species. High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo's mountains, as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest. There are about 210 mammal species in the country. Over 620 species of birds have been recorded in Peninsular Malaysia, with many endemic to the mountains there. A high number of endemic bird species are also found in Malaysian Borneo. 250 reptile species have been recorded in the country, with about 150 species of snakes and 80 species of lizards. There are about 150 species of frogs, and thousands of insect species. Malaysia's exclusive economic zone is 1.5 times larger than its land area, and some of its waters are in the Coral Triangle, a biodiversity hotspot. The waters around Sipadan island are the most biodiverse in the world. Bordering East Malaysia, the Sulu Sea is a biodiversity hotspot, with around 600 coral species and 1200 fish species. The unique biodiversity of Malaysian Caves always attracts lovers of <b>ecotourism</b> from all over the world.|$|E
5|$|Sabah's {{economy is}} mainly based on primary sector such as agriculture, {{forestry}} and petroleum. Currently, the tertiary sector {{plays an important}} part to the state economy, especially in tourism and services. With its richness in biodiversity, the state is offering <b>ecotourism.</b> Although {{in recent years the}} tourism industry has been affected by attacks and kidnapping of tourists by militant groups based in the southern Philippines, it remained stable with the increase of security in eastern Sabah and the Sulu Sea. The tourism sector contribute 10% share of the state GDP and was predicted to increase more. Majority of the tourists come from China (60.3%), followed by South Korea (33.9%), Australia (16.3%) and Taiwan (8.3%). Since the 1950s, rubber and copra are the main source of agricultural economy of North Borneo. The timber industry start to emerged in the 1960s due to high demand of raw materials from industrial countries. This was however replaced by petroleum in the 1970s after the discovery of oil in the area of west coast Sabah. In the same year, cocoa and palm oil was added to the list. The Sabah state government managed to increase the state fund from RM6million to RM12billion and poverty was down by almost half to 33.1% in 1980. The state rapid development on primary sector has attracted those job seekers in neighbouring Indonesia and the Philippines as the state labour force itself are not sufficient. The state Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at the time ranked behind Selangor and Kuala Lumpur, being the third richest although the manufacturing sector remained small. However, by 2000, the state started to become the poorest as it still dependent on natural resources as its primary sources of income comparing to those secondary sector producer states. Thus the Sabah Development Corridor (SDC) was established in 2008 by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi with a total investment of RM105billion for 18 years to increase the state GDP to RM63.2billion by 2025. Around RM5.83billion were allocated each year for infrastructures development along with the creation of 900,000 jobs. The federal government targeted to eradicate hardcore poverty by the end Ninth Malaysia Plan (9MP) with overall poverty halved from 23% in 2004 to 12% in 2010 and 8.1% in 2012. Since its establishment in 2008, the state GDP increase to 10.7% which was higher than the national economic growth of 4.8% and the world economic growth of 2.7%. Following the world financial crisis in 2009, Sabah GDP recorded 4.8% growth compared to −1.5% for national level and −0.4% for world level.|$|E
