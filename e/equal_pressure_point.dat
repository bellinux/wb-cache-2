50|$|The active {{cycle of}} {{breathing}} techniques (ACBT) is a flexible regimen comprising breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises and the FET, frequently combined with gravity-assisted positioning. Increasing lung volumes during thoracic expansion allows air {{to get behind}} distal secretions via collateral ventilatory channels. During a forced expiratory manoeuvre, compression and narrowing occurs within the airways at a point dependent on lung volume (the <b>equal</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>point).</b> This is shifted distally as a forced expiration is continued to low lung volume, thereby mobilizing peripheral secretions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} {{a model to}} describe {{some aspects of the}} deformation of the central region of the human lung considered as a continuous elastically deformable medium. To achieve this purpose, we study the interaction between the pipes composing the tree and the fluid that goes through it. We use a quasi-static approximation to determine the deformed radius of each branch. Then, we solve a constrained minimization problem, so as to minimize the viscous (dissipated) energy in the tree. The key feature of our approach is the use of a fixed point theorem in order to find the optimal flow associated to a deformed tree. We also give some numerical results with interesting consequences on human lung deformation during expiration, particularly concerning the localization of the <b>equal</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>point</b> (EPP). 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification...|$|E
40|$|We {{used the}} {{retrograde}} catheter technique {{to investigate the}} effect of HeO 2 on resistance to maximum expiratory flow (Vmax) in airways subsegments between alveoli and the <b>equal</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>point</b> (EPP), and between EPP and the flow-limiting segment (FLS). FLS were found at the same airway site in sublobar bronchi (i. d., 0. 54 +/- 0. 13 cm) on both air and HeO 2 in the six human excised lungs studied. Static elastic recoil pressure (5 +/- 1 cm H 2 O) and the lateral pressure at FLS (critical transmural airway pressure - 6 +/- 3 cm H 2 O) were not different on the two gases. delta Vmax averaged 37 +/- 8. 9 % and {{was similar to the}} value found in healthy subjects of similar age (66 +/- 10 yr). EPP were located on HeO 2 in peripheral airways (i. d., 0. 33 +/- 0. 03 cm), and EPP on air were located more downstream. Resistance between EPP and FLS was highly density dependent. Resistance between alveoli and EPP behaved as if it were density independent, due in part to Poiseuille flow in the peripheral airways and in part to the consequent narrowing of peripheral airways on HeO 2. This density-independent behavior in peripheral airways reduced delta Vmax on HeO 2 from its predicted maximal amount of 62 %. Assuming that FLS is the "choke point" {{these findings are consistent with}} wave-speed theory of flow limitation modified to include functionally density-independent pressure losses in peripheral airways. These results and conclusions are similar to those found in living dogs. They question previous interpretation of delta Vmax as an index of peripheral airway obstruction, and demonstrate the utility of the wave-speed theory in explaining complicated mechanisms of expiratory flow limitation...|$|E
40|$|Bronchodilatation was {{produced}} in normal subjects by the inhalation of atropine, a parasympatholytic agent, and isoproterenol, a beta adrenergic stimulator. Density dependence of maximal expiratory flow (Vmax), expressed as a ratio of Vmax with an 80 % helium- 20 % oxygen gas mixture to Vmax with air at isolung volumes, indicated that the predominant flow regimes across upstream airways changed differently after each agent was given separately. After atropine Vmax increased, elastic recoil pressure did not change, and density dependence decreased. Utilizing the <b>equal</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> analysis which defines upstream and downstream segments of the intrathoracic airways at flow limitation, these results suggest a greater relative dilatation of the larger upstream airways such that more of the driving pressure is dissipated across the smaller airways in which flow is less dependent upon gas density. After isoproterenol Vmax increased, elastic recoil pressure did not change, and density dependence increased. This suggests a preferential dilatation of the smaller and more peripheral airways with less density-dependent flow regimes such that more of the driving pressure would be dissipated in the larger airways in which flow is more dependent upon gas density. Systematic decreases after isoproterenol lead independently to the same conclusion. After both agents together, Vmax increased and density dependence and critical alveolar pressures did not change from control, suggesting a relatively uniform dilatation of all the airways comprising the upstream segment...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundIn {{diabetic}} individuals (DI), neuropathy hinders theredistribution of plantar <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> thus leading tosusceptible {{areas where}} there is constant capillaryblanching which may develop into trophic ulcers. Theredistribution of <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> may precede evidenceof clinical neuropathy. In this study we comparetemporal redistribution of plantar <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> (areasof capillary blanching) between normal subjects taken ascontrols and DI with no clinical signs of neuropathy. MethodFour adults (45 ± 4. 55 years) diagnosed to have Type- 2 Diabetes, without signs of clinical neuropathy andage -matched controls (43 ± 3. 74 years) were studied. The {{subjects were asked to}} stand on a glass slab and a 10 minute video recording of 10 selected plantarpressure points was made. Changes in the distance ofthese points with reference to a defined point onMayer’s line were measured at every 10 seconds. Standard deviation of difference of redistributedconsecutive <b>pressure</b> <b>point</b> (SDPP) in cms., andfractal dimension (FD) was used to compare the twogroups. ResultsCombined mean SDPP (DI = 0. 013 ± 0. 008 cms,controls= 0. 196 ± 0. 233 cms, P < 0. 001) and FD (DI= 1. 000 ± 0. 000, controls= 1. 010 ± 0. 017, P < 0. 001) ofdiabetic patients were significantly lower thancontrols. <b>Pressure</b> <b>point</b> at base of the 4 th toe andthe lower limit of blanching to the left Mayers line atthe heel did not differ significantly between DI andcontrols. ConclusionThere is impaired redistribution of plantar pressurepoints in individuals with diabetes without signs ofclinical neuropathy. This can be attributed to loss ofchaos generating mechanisms in DI. Redistributionof <b>pressure</b> <b>points</b> may be essential in theprevention of trophic ulcers in susceptibleindividuals...|$|R
