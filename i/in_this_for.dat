5|$|Upon {{graduation}} Paton joined Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, {{which had}} been founded in 1922. One of his first jobs there was {{to assist with the}} design of a new jetty for Barking Power Station. In 1927 he worked on a dam at Maentwrog in North Wales and between 1932 and 1933 was resident engineer on the Glenlee portion of the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. Paton was seconded to the Rangoon Port Trust in 1930 to construct a wharf for the export of Lead from Burma. This wharf survived a serious earthquake on 5 May 1930 and was opened on 20 February 1931. On 10 April 1931 Paton sailed to Canada to undertake a survey of its ports and outline the additional facilities that would be required in the next 25â€“50 years. He was assisted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> six weeks by Ralph Freeman who had designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The report was issued on 15 January 1932 but was not implemented until 1935 with the election of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of Canada. The report's findings continued to be in use until the 1970s. Paton was responsible {{for the construction of a}} new brewery for Guinness in Park Royal, London from October 1933 to October 1936. This was the biggest job of his career thus far and involved the construction of seven steel framed buildings, a power station, a storage silo, roads and railway sidings. Paton also built industrial and trading estates in Wales, West Cumberland and London. He was made a partner in the firm in 1938.|$|E
500|$|Harvey {{possesses}} {{an expansive}} contralto vocal range. Harvey dislikes repeating {{herself in her}} music, resulting in very different-sounding albums. In an October 2004 interview with Rolling Stone, she said: [...] "when I'm {{working on a new}} record, {{the most important thing is}} to not repeat myself... that's always my aim: to try and cover new ground and really to challenge myself. Because I'm <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> learning." [...] While her musical style has been described as alternative rock, punk blues, art rock, and avant-rock, she has experimented with various other genres including electronica, indie rock and folk music.|$|E
500|$|After his execution, Yue Fei's {{reputation}} for defending the Southern Song grew {{to that of}} a national folk hero. Qin Hui was denigrated by later historians, who accused him of betraying the Song. The real Yue Fei differed from the later myths based on his exploits. Contrary to traditional legends, Yue was only one of many generals who fought against the Jin in northern China. Traditional accounts have also blamed Gaozong for Yue Fei's execution and submitting to the Jin. Qin Hui, in a reply to Gaozong's gratitude for the success of the peace negotiations, told the emperor that [...] "the decision to make peace was entirely Your Majesty's. Your servant only carried it out; what achievement was there <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> me?" ...|$|E

500|$|In 1843, her {{interest}} in the anti-slavery movement was aroused by a visit from Boston philanthropist Samuel May. In 1846 she attended a meeting which was addressed by prominent abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison and Frederick Douglass, who had escaped from slavery in 1838. She contributed to fund-raising efforts in the abolitionist cause and maintained an interest <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> the next twenty years. Her brothers William, Philip and Russell and her sister Anna were also active in this campaign. In 1851 the return of a fugitive slave from Boston back to the southern states caused her to say of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 that the United States had [...] "committed an atrocious act... against humanity, against itself, against God." [...] This event caused her to concentrate on her educational work.|$|E
500|$|Proponents of {{neoliberalism}} have {{theorized that}} by increasing women's {{participation in the}} workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have noted that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations. Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination {{in the family and}} the workplace. The [...] "feminization of employment" [...] refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure. [...] Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages. [...] Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> <b>for</b> instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as 'secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.|$|E

The danger <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> Chamberlain was that he preferred to forget that he exercised such influence, and so increasingly mistook his pliant press for real public opinion...the {{truth of the matter}} was that by controlling the press he was merely ensuring that the press was unable to reflect public opinion.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1920s, Courtneidge, {{a lifelong}} socialist, joined with other {{managers}} including Arthur Bourchier in campaigning for fair pay for chorus members and players of small parts. Many other managements lagged behind <b>in</b> <b>this,</b> <b>for</b> instance not paying salaries during rehearsals. Courtneidge said in 1924, [...] "There {{is a large}} section of theatrical managers who will not deal justly. The actor is again forced to the wall, and compelled to fight for his rights." [...] He had earlier resigned from the Actors' Association, {{of which he had}} been a founder member, disagreeing with its closed shop policy, but his indignation at a proposed new standard contract for actors led him to rejoin.|$|E
2500|$|Shevlin was {{survived by}} his widow and two children. Shevlin left a fortune {{estimated}} to be worth $3,500,000. [...] The estate was left in trust for his children, and his widow was left with an allowance of $60,000 per year. [...] He also left more than $1.5 million in life insurance, most of which went to the companies that he ran. [...] Only seven other men in the United States carried as much life insurance as Shevlin. [...] After his death, the $1.5 million life insurance purchased by the Shevlin companies was used by life insurance in a major advertising campaign promoting the use of keyman insurance. [...] The following text from a full-page advertisement in The Atlanta Constitution is an example:"The value of an officer or worker in any partnership or corporation is most realized at his death. [...] Then insurance {{in favor of the}} business should be ready to replace him. [...] Tom Shevlin's firm lost its most valuable asset in Tom Shevlin's death, but insurance of about a million dollars will replace his loss. [...] There's a real moral <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>for</b> Atlanta partnerships and corporations -- be prepared." ...|$|E
