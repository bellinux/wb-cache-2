5|$|Because Eastern European Romani {{communities}} were less organised than Jewish communities, Porajmos {{was not well}} documented. There also existed a trend to downplay the actual figures, according to Ian Hancock, <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> of Romani Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Tony Gatlif, whose films mostly have Romani people as subjects, had long {{wanted to make a}} documentary on this less well-known subject, but the lack of enough documented evidence coupled with the absence of accurate pre-war census figures for the Romani made it difficult.|$|E

25|$|The Biomedical Informatics Training Program, in the Department of Biomedical Informatics, prepares {{individuals}} {{for research and}} development careers emphasizing the application of modern information technology to health care, biological and clinical research, and education of health professionals. The program offers master’s and doctoral degrees in biomedical informatics. Specific concentrations of study can be obtained in the areas of bioinformatics, dental informatics, health services research, and infectious disease and public health informatics (biosurveillance). A Certificate Program is also available to serve students {{with a wide variety of}} goals and backgrounds. At the discretion of the <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> short-term traineeships can be arranged. Such training can be done on a part-time basis. The program also offers non-degree postdoctoral fellowships (such applicants must have a doctoral degree in the health sciences), designed to provide two years of full-time fellowship training.|$|E
25|$|In September 1934, Malden {{decided to}} leave his home in Gary, Indiana, to pursue formal {{dramatic}} training at the Goodman School (later part of DePaul University), then associated with the Goodman Theater in Chicago. Although he {{had worked in the}} steel mills in Gary for three years, he had helped support his family and was consequently unable to save enough money to pay for his schooling. Making a deal with the <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> he gave the institute the little money that he did have, with the director agreeing that, if Malden did well, he would be rewarded with a full scholarship. He won the scholarship. When Malden performed in the Goodman's children's theater, he wooed the actress Mona Greenberg (stage name: Mona Graham), who married him in 1938. He graduated from the Chicago Art Institute in 1937. Soon after, without work and without money, Malden returned to his hometown.|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{communication}} theory also encompasses {{access to the}} public sphere, whose voices are heard in that sphere, {{and the ways in}} which the field of communication studies has limited what is regarded as essential to public discourse. The recognition of a full history of women orators overlooked and disregarded by the field has effectively become an undertaking of recovery, as it establishes and honors the existence of women in history and lauds the communication by these historically significant contributors. This recovery effort, begun by Andrea Lunsford, Professor of English and <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> in Writing and Rhetoric at Stanford University and followed by other feminist communication theorists also names women such as Aspasia, Diotima, and Christine de Pisan, who were likely influential in rhetorical and communication traditions in classical and medieval times, but who have been negated as serious contributors to the traditions.|$|E

25|$|Donald Niewyk and Frances Nicosia {{write that}} the death toll was at least 130,000 out of the nearly one million Romani who resided in Nazi-controlled Europe. Michael Berenbaum writes that serious {{scholarly}} estimates lie between 90,000 and 220,000. A study by Sybil Milton, senior historian at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, calculated a death toll of at least 220,000 and possibly closer to 500,000, but this study explicitly excluded the Independent State of Croatia where the genocide of Romanies was intense. Martin Gilbert estimates {{a total of more}} than 220,000 deaths out of the 700,000 Romani who lived in Europe. Ian Hancock, <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin, has argued in favor of a much higher figure of between 500,000 and 1,500,000 deaths, claiming that the Romani death toll proportionally equaled or exceeded that of Jewish victims.|$|E
500|$|After the war ended, new Gilwell Park camp chief John Thurman was {{interested}} in persuading the Boy Scouts of America to adapt Wood Badge. The new Chief Scout Executive Elbert K.

500|$|In 1989, Hillenburg {{enrolled}} in the Experimental Animation Program at CalArts: [...] "Changing careers like that is scary, but {{the irony is that}} animation is a pretty healthy career right now and science education is more of a struggle," [...] he admitted. He studied under Jules Engel, the founding <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> whom he considers his [...] "Art Dad" [...] and mentor. Engel accepted him into the program impressed by The Intertidal Zone. Hillenburg posited further, [...] " [...] also was a painter, so I think he saw my paintings and could easily say, 'Oh, this guy could fit in to this program.' I don't have any [...] animation really." [...] He graduated in 1992, earning a Master of Fine Arts in experimental animation.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, the Violence Policy Center (VPC) {{released}} Gun Shows in America: Tupperware® Parties for Criminals, a {{study that}} identified problems associated with gun shows. The VPC study documented {{the effect of the}} 1986 Firearms Owners' Protection Act in regard to proliferation of gun shows, which resulted in [...] "a readily available source of weapons and ammunition {{for a wide variety of}} criminals, as well as Timothy McVeigh and David Koresh". According to the VPC, the utility of gun shows to dangerous individuals stems primarily from the exemption enjoyed by private sellers from the sales criteria of the Brady law as well as the absence of a background check. The <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> which is located at the UC Davis, Garen J. Wintemute, wrote, [...] "There is no such loophole in federal law, in the limited sense that the law does not exempt private-party sales at gun shows from regulation that is required elsewhere." [...] Wintemute said, The fundamental flaw in the gun show loophole proposal is its failure to address the great majority of private-party sales, which occur at other locations and increasingly over the Internet at sites where any non-prohibited person can list firearms for sale and buyers can search for private-party sellers.|$|E
500|$|Some {{observers}} {{found the}} report and its figures plausible. Tom Treasure of Guy's Hospital, London, said the Kilgour–Matas report was [...] "plausible from a medical standpoint" [...] based on the numerical gap {{in the number of}} transplants and the short waiting times in China compared with other countries. He noted the existence of blood tests of imprisoned Falun Gong followers, which is not useful for the victims but is critical to organ donation, and said the allegations were “credible.” Non-fiction writer Scott Carney included the allegations in his book The Red Market, writing [...] "No one is saying the Chinese government went after the Falun Gong specifically for their organs… but it {{seems to have been a}} remarkably convenient and profitable way to dispose of them. Dangerous political dissidents were executed while their organs created a comfortable revenue stream for hospitals and surgeons, and presumably many important Chinese officials received organs." [...] Using different research methods to Kilgour and Matas, Ethan Gutmann, adjunct fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, found that his estimate of the number of Falun Gong practitioners killed for organs of approximately 65,000 was close to the estimate of 62,250 by Kilgour and Matas. In September 2014 he published his findings in The Slaughter: Mass Killings, Organ Harvesting, and China’s Secret Solution to Its Dissident Problem. Kirk C. Allison, Associate <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> in Human Rights and Medicine in the University of Minnesota, wrote that the [...] "short time frame of an on-demand system [...] requires a large pool of donors pre-typed for blood group and HLA matching," [...] and would be consistent with the Falun Gong allegations about the systematic tissue typing of practitioners held prisoner. He wrote that the time constraints involved [...] "cannot be assured on a random-death basis", and that physicians he queried about the matter indicated that they were selecting live prisoners to ensure quality and compatibility.|$|E

2500|$|Roma Included in {{the figures}} of total war dead are the Roma victims of the Nazi persecution; some {{scholars}} include the Roma deaths with the Holocaust. Most estimates of Roma (Gypsies) victims range from 130,000 to 500,000. Ian Hancock, <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at the University of Texas at Austin, has argued in favour of a higher figure of between 500,000 and 1,500,000 Roma dead. Hancock writes that, proportionately, the death toll equaled [...] "and almost certainly exceed, that of Jewish victims". In a 2010 publication, Ian Hancock stated that he agrees with {{the view that the}} number of Romanis killed has been underestimated as a result of being grouped with others in Nazi records under headings such as [...] "remainder to be liquidated", [...] "hangers-on" [...] and [...] "partisans".|$|E
