Žinias apie pozityvią motinystę turi suteikti spec. literatūra (66. 6 proc.), gyd. ginekologas (58. 1 proc.) bei nemokami valstybės finansuojami motinystės kursai (56. 7 proc.). 3. „Motinystės mokyklos“ poreikis nemokamoms teorinėms ir praktinėms paskaitoms didesnis turinčioms aukštąjį neuniversitetinį išsilavinimą ištekėjusioms ir gyvenančioms mieste besilaukiančioms. Praktinės rekomendacijos : Gyd. ginekologams informuoti paaugles (mokykloje) ir kiekvieną besilaukiančią bei jos partnerį apie galimybę ir būtinybę lankyti motinystės mokyklą, skatinti akušeres aktyviai dalyvauti šioje veikloje. Aim of studies: To {{assess the}} need for “Maternity School” in Šiauliai city {{according}} to experts as well as pregnant women and mothers raising babies {{under the age of}} one. Research methods: The research has been carried out in Šiauliai city within the period of October 2011 – March 2012. Target convenient selection method has been selected for carrying out the research. All in all 141 women and 5 experts have participated in the survey. The group of respondents has been formed in respect of research feature: women who were pregnant at that time or raised {{children under the age of}} one and experts, working with pregnant women as well as women who had recently given birth, providing services of “Maternity school” or directly related to the aforementioned activities. Results: Health of the respondents was in good shape (76. 6 per cent), women who were pregnant at that time or raised babies under the age of one in the age group of 26 - 35 years were interested in their own health as well as their partner‘s health (54. 7 per cent), 81. 2 per cent of them resided in the city and 69. 7 per cent of them had a higher university education. Mostly women (62. 9 per cent) consulted a Physician – Gynaecologist, if they felt the symptoms of pregnancy. The amount of information on the needs of pregnancy provided during the consultation, duration of the majority thereof ranged from 10 to 15 min. (57. 4 per cent), was sufficient for 58. 2 per cent of respondents: 90 per cent of the women resided in a village and 54. 9 per cent of them resided in the city. 24. 1 per cent of the respondents did not get any information about the “Maternity school” from their gynaecologists. 46. 8 per cent of women attended maternity courses, 68. 8 per cent of them had <b>higher</b> <b>non-university</b> <b>education</b> and 53. 1 of them resided in the city. 85 per cent of women attended free courses and 15 per cent of them attended paid courses together with their husbands (30 per cent), 60 per cent of the women who attended the courses were married, 64 per cent of them got practical knowledge as well. Conclusions: 1. Experts claim that there was a need for “Maternity school”. 2. Pregnant women as well as women who had recently given birth mostly refer to a Physician – Gynaecologist regarding information on the subject of maternity (62. 9 per cent). Knowledge on positive maternity should be provided by means of spec. readings (66. 6 per cent), by a Physician – Gynaecologist (58. 1 per cent), and during free maternity courses financed by the state (56. 7 per cent). 3. A greater need for free theoretical and practical lectures at “Maternity school” is expressed by pregnant women with <b>higher</b> <b>non-university</b> <b>education</b> who were married and resided in the city. Practical recommendations: Physicians – Gynaecologists ought to inform teenage girls (at school) and every pregnant woman and her partner about an opportunity and necessity to attend a maternity school, encourage obstetricians to take an active participation in these activities...|$|E

Objectives. 1) to assess overall {{job satisfaction}} of physical therapists; 2) to determine factors, affecting job satisfaction of physical therapists. Methods. The survey {{was carried out}} during the congress of Lithuanian Physical Therapy Association (28 May 2004). 224 questionnaires were distributed and 202 returned (response rate - 90. 1 %). 179 questionnaires were analysed. Job satisfaction was evaluated in scores from 1 (completely dissatisfied) to 5 (completely satisfied). Data analysis was performed {{with the help of}} statistical package SPSS 10. Statistical procedures: chi-square‘s test (χ²), Spearman rank correlation, Student (t) test, dispersion analysis (ANOVA). Results. 77. 6 % of physical therapists were satisfied with their work, 17. 9 %- neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, 4. 5 % - dissatisfied. The score of overall job satisfaction was 3. 8 out of 5. There {{were no significant differences in}} job satisfaction by gender, age groups, working experience, and workplace. Respondents with higher university education were more satisfied in their work than respondents with <b>higher</b> <b>non-university</b> <b>education</b> (scores 3. 9 and 3. 68; p< 0. 05). We found negative correlation between job satisfaction and the intent to change profession or workplace (correlation coefficients - 0. 39 and - 0. 46; p< 0. 05). Statistically significant relationships between job satisfaction and pay (correlation coefficient 0. 25), opportunity to learn and improve professional skills (0. 24), opportunity to plan their work (0. 23), career (0. 22), recognition at work (0. 22), competence of manager (0. 20), independence in decision making (0. 20) were found. Physical therapists gave the highest satisfaction scores to communication with colleagues (3. 94 from 5), job being interesting (3. 73), and competence of colleagues (3. 71). Minimal scores were given to salary (1. 8) and its increase (1. 8), paperwork amount (2. 56), and physicians’ opinion about physical therapist profession (2. 64). Respondents with different age and job experience reported different level of satisfaction with physical load and amount of work: physical therapists, who were older and had longer work experience were less satisfied with these aspects. Conclusions. 1. The vast majority of physical therapists (77. 6 %) were satisfied with their work. 2. Statistically significant relationships between job satisfaction and salary, opportunity to learn and improve professional skills, opportunity to plan their work, career, recognition at work, and independence in decision making were found.

The recent history concerns the ‘binary system’ of the 1970 s and 1980 s and in particular the characteristics of the polytechnics that provided the core of the non-university arm of that system. The ‘ancient’ concerns the traditions of state-university relationships in the United Kingdom and the unusually large degrees of autonomy enjoyed by the latter.

40|$|As a {{contribution}} to the history of higher education in English further education colleges, two policy episodes are sketched and compared. Both periods saw attempts to expand courses of higher education outside the universities. In the first, ahead of policies to concentrate <b>non-university</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> in the strongest institutions, efforts were made after 1944 to recognize a hierarchy of colleges, with separate tiers associated with different volumes and types of advanced further education. In the second, soon after unification of the higher education sector {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 s, all colleges in the further education sector were encouraged to offer higher-level programmes and qualifications, with a reluctance or refusal on the part of central government to plan, coordinate, or configure this provision. The two episodes highlight very different assumptions about what types of institutions should be involved in what kinds of higher education. They are a reminder too of how short is the policy memory on higher education within modern-day governments and their agencies. ...|$|R

These mostly cognitive strategies are considered by the students as the only way for acquiring language knowledge and skills. Depending on the age, the objective conditions and subjective motivation, their learning strategies change. They can overcome the obstacles in the study of the second foreign language by means of focusing on the conscious use of metacognitive and social - affective strategies.

40|$|General {{description}} The {{relationship between}} {{teaching and research}} touches the core of higher education (Clark, 1997). In the last decade {{there has been a}} growing debate about the relation between research and teaching in both university and <b>non-university</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> (Brew, 2006; Elen & Verburgh, 2008; Griffiths, 2004). Pleas for strengthening the link between teaching and research or enhancing the integration of research into teaching are common. Brew (2006), for example, states that the integration of research into teaching can {{contribute to the development of}} competencies, such as inquiry skills, which are essential to function in the emerging knowledge society. For <b>non-university</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> which originally did not have a research mandate and where research is relatively new in comparison to the traditional universities, research might be an even more complex and sensitive issue (Kyvik & Skodvin, 2003). To fully understand the relationship between teaching and research, it is necessary to learn how lecturers conceive research, what they aim at by integrating research into teaching and how they integrate research in their actual educational practices (Brew, 2001; Robertson & Bond, 2001; Rowland, 1996) This study builds on research about academics’ conceptions of research (e. g. Akerlind, 2008; Brew, 2001; Prosser, Martin, Trigwell, Ramsden, & Middleton, 2008; Visser-Wijnveen, 2009). Brew (2001) interviewed senior researchers in universities and identified four qualitatively different ways in which research is understood: trading, journey, layer and domino variation. These are differentiated according to (a) whether they have an external product orientation or an internal process orientation and (b) the extent to which the researchers’ personal concerns influence their conceptions of research: whether the researchers themselves are in the forefront of their awareness or whether they appear to be incidental to their awareness. Visser-Wijnveen (2009) interviewed by means of metaphors academics about their conceptions of research. She distinguished five categories of research: disclosing patterns, searching for patterns, explaining patterns, pointing out patterns, and creating patterns. These categories are similar to the categories identified by Brew (2001). A major limitation of these studies is that they are highly individualized and mostly neglect the contextual features within which the different positions are taken. Past research mainly interviewed individual lecturers on their conceptions of research and their attempts to integrate research into teaching. In <b>non-university</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> the situation is different. Lecturers often work in a context that is more negotiated at a group level. The idea of integrating research into teaching is not necessarily the immediate and self-evident consequence of lecturers doing research. The idea often stems from a decision made at the program level. Responsibles decide that for particular reasons research has to get integrated. Given that lecturers have to work within those boundaries, it is extremely interesting to get to know how lecturers alone and as a group deal with the nexus-challenge. The present study is an attempt to explore this issue in two <b>non-university</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> programs in which research integration into teaching was put forward as an important characteristic of the program. Methods The study aims at analyzing lecturers’ research conceptions, their interpretation of integrating research into teaching and actual practices of research integration. The present study involved two programs (one from ‘social work’ and another one from ‘teacher education’). With lecturers from each program (separate) focusgroups were organized. Data were collected by focusgroup interviews with an individual drawing activity as opening task. Lecturers received a sheet of paper and were asked to draw “a research activity”. They were told that they would be asked to explain their drawing to the other participants once finished. These explanations allowed the moderator to ask in the remainder of the focusgroup more about the conceptions of research, details of the drawings, etc. In the next phase in the focusgroup categories of drawings were identified. Each category refers to a research activity (or a group of research activities) or to features of research activity. Then participants ranked the categories according to their importance for their students’ careers. The focusgroup concluded with a discussion about their approaches to integrate research in the curriculum. Individual lecturers provided input while at the same time that input was discussed in the group in view of developing common understanding. Conclusions Initial analyses of the data reveal interesting patterns. Both similarities and clear differences are retrieved. A diverse set of categories describing ‘research activities’ was identified with most lecturers pointing to (aspects of a) ‘research cycle’. Although lecturers from two very distinct programs were participating, there seems to be some consensus that a recurrent feature of research is that it is the result of a ‘critical attitude’. This feature is regarded to be extremely important for students’ professional career. It is argued that integrating research into teaching will help students to become more critical. This consensus does not result in similar practices with respect to the integration of research into teaching. Lecturers may generally agree that students have to engage in some kind of research activity, the nature of such a research activity is very diverse (going from consulting information (desktop research) over independent gathering of new data (surveying) to developing realia (model building)). Further analyses will indicate whether the conception of research is linked to the approach with respect to the integration of research into teaching. status: publishe...|$|R

A number of survey instruments {{have been developed to}} strengthen the measurement and reporting of student experience.

The inclusion of the non-self-accrediting (<b>non-university)</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> providers (NSA-HEPs) in these national auditing activities since 2006 has brought about considerable professionalization of Quality Assurance (QA) in that sector. Three aspects of this professionalization are evident. The first is the inclusion of these institutions in the national audit schedule, bringing a consistent and co-ordinated approach to audit, and ready public availability of audit results and themes. The second is the improved professional development of managers from the NSA-HEPs through workshops, guidelines and audit training and participation. While these two aspects have been predominantly driven from AUQA, the third response is from the sector itself to undertake its own improvement, through a key benchmarking study initiated by one of the sector organizations. It is clearly evident that the professionalization of the NSA-HEP sector has not only resulted from the professionalism of AUQA but has itself further stimulated the professionalization of the agency, as demonstrated by the appointment of specialist staff. It is anticipated that this professionalization of quality assurance will spread further from higher education to other sectors of post-secondary education. The imminent formation of a new agency, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency (TEQSA), will further develop an integrated and professionalized approach to quality assurance across all of Australian tertiary education, including the vocational sector...|$|R

50|$|High {{school courses}} in English, mathematics, science, electronics, {{computer}} technology, drafting and design, visual arts, and computer graphics {{are useful for}} people considering a drafting career. Attributes required by drafters include technical writing skills, problem-solving skills, the ability to visualize three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional drawings as well as drawing the relationships between parts in machinery and various pieces of infrastructure. Other skills include an in depth knowledge of the qualities of metals, plastics, wood and other materials used in the overall manufacturing processes and of construction methods and standards. Employers prefer applicants who have also completed training after high school at a vocational school. Drafting and design certificates and diplomas are generally offered by trade and technical schools and <b>non-university</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> institutions like community colleges or industrial training institutes. Apprenticeships combine paid on-the-job training and experience with in-class instruction. People interested in becoming drafters can get qualified as either drafting technologists or drafting technicians. Drafting technologists usually have a 2 to 3-year diploma in engineering design or drafting technology from a community college or technical school. Drafters starting out tend to move from company to company to gain experience and to move up. A more senior drafter often moves up into a management position where they become able to supervise entire projects as they gain more experience or they can start their own business and become self-employed. It is also possible for experienced drafters to enter related fields such as engineering, architecture, industrial design, interior design, exhibit design, landscape design, set design, and animation.|$|R
