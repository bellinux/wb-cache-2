5|$|In two instances, the equestrian {{portion of}} the Olympics has been held in a {{different}} location {{from the rest of}} the games. The first was during the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia when, due to Australian quarantine laws, the equestrian portion was held in Stockholm, Sweden. At the next IOC meeting, it was decided to hold a special Equestrian Olympic Games several months before the actual Olympics, complete with its own opening and closing ceremonies. This meant that Switzerland, which had officially boycotted the 1956 Games because of the Soviet Union's recent invasion of Hungary, still brought home a medal because of its participation in the equestrian portion several months earlier. The second instance was during the 2008 Summer Olympics, when the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing. This decision was made when, in 2005, international veterinary groups refused to certify the main Olympic city as free of equine diseases. This would have resulted in horses leaving Beijing after the games and <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> lengthy quarantine processes before being allowed to re-enter their home countries. Hong Kong also had the benefit of having better facilities, including a top equine hospital and one of only a few equine drug-testing labs in the world.|$|E

25|$|ABA's U.S. Gold Cup {{series of}} events were created in 1981 and then, in 2000, {{as part of the}} {{sponsorship}} agreement with then-sponsor Redline Bicycles, was renamed the Redline Cup Series, before switching back to being called the Gold Cup in 2014 following Redline's decision to no longer sponsor the successful series. Gold Cup (Redline Cup) races are a series of regional championship events that are held mostly {{for the benefit of the}} amateur racer - with a No.1 plate (designated by a yellow background) on the line for the overall winner of the age and classification. Its original purpose was to give non factory sponsored amateurs-then as today the great majority of BMX racers-a chance for a national title without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the great expense of touring the country racing in nationals competing against sponsored national caliber racers. It originally was a one-off Jag like Championship race on November 27, 1981 in which the competitors just had to come in the top 100 in their districts to compete. It became a six race qualifying series in 1982 held in conjunction with standard nationals. Like in its inaugural year, the Championships was held the day before the ABA Grand Nationals in Oklahoma as a pre race. In succeeding years the ABA allowed the track operators to choose when to hold the qualifying races and they weren't held at the same time and place as nationals with the finals being held in Las Vegas, Nevada in October. In the year 2001 the ABA changed the name of the U.S. Gold Cup Series to the Redline Cup Series. Redline Bicycles had been sponsoring the Gold Cup Series for the prior six racing seasons. Today the Gold Cup Series Championship or simply the Gold Cup, is the second most sought after title in the ABA. The races are a series of over 60 multi-point (double and triple) qualifying races in 35 states in the U.S. and one Canadian Province (2008 edition), which is divided into Western, Central and Eastern regions of approximately 14 to 21 qualifying races in each region.|$|E

[...] "The final scenes do a very nice job of closing the high school chapter of the Veronica Mars story, while also leaving plenty {{of questions about the}} future of some characters in particular." [...] Goldman also lauded the performances of Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni, writing that [...] "As always, Kristen Bell and Enrico Colantoni knock it out of the park, with Bell especially <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a rather stunning amount of emotional transitions, all of which she does spectacularly." ...|$|E

Coward himself made light of it: when asked by a journalist why he was known as [...] "The Master", he replied, [...] "Oh, you know – Jack of all trades, master of none." [...] He could, however, joke about his own immodesty: [...] "My sense of my importance to the world is relatively small. On the other hand, my sense of my own importance to myself is tremendous." [...] When a Time interviewer apologised, [...] "I hope you haven't been bored <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> all these interviews for your [...] birthday, having to answer the same old questions about yourself", Coward rejoined, [...] "Not at all.

500|$|Reinhart {{began his}} junior career with his {{hometown}} Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League (OMJHL) in 1975–76, scoring 39 points in 53 games. He {{had been a}} protected player of the Rangers— signed directly by the team without his <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the league's draft—but when the OMJHL eliminated the rules allowing teams to protect midget-aged players following the season, he was made eligible for the 1976 draft. [...] The Peterborough Petes claimed him with the third overall selection in the June 1976 draft, {{despite the fact that}} Reinhart and his family made it known he would refuse to play for any team other than Kitchener. [...] His agent, Alan Eagleson, threatened to take the team and league to court in a bid to force them to respect Reinhart's wishes. The dispute was not settled until November when the Petes traded Reinhart to Kitchener as part of a three-team trade that involved the Oshawa Generals. [...] The league had to rescind a rule prohibiting teams from trading first round draft picks to allow the deal to pass and to avoid the threat of litigation by Eagleson.|$|E

500|$|In June 2001 the {{government}} established Indian Residential Schools Resolution Canada {{as an independent}} government department to manage the residential school file. In 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process was launched {{as part of a}} larger National Resolution Framework which included health supports, a commemoration component and a strategy for litigation. As explained by the TRC, the ADR was designed as a [...] "voluntary process for resolution of certain claims of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and forcible confinement, without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the civil litigation process". It was created by the Canadian government without consultation with Indigenous communities or former residential school students. The ADR system also made it the responsibility of the former students to prove that the abuse occurred and was intentional, resulting in former students finding the system difficult to navigate, re-traumatizing, and discriminatory. Many survivor advocacy groups and Indigenous political organizations such as the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) worked to have the ADR system dissolved. In 2004 the Assembly of First Nations released a report critical of the ADR underscoring, among other issues, the failure of survivors to automatically receive the full amount of compensation without subsequent ligation against the church and failure to compensate for lost family, language and culture. The Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development released its own report in April 2005 finding the ADR to be [...] "an excessively costly and inappropriately applied failure, for which the Minister and her officials are unable to raise a convincing defence". Within a month of the report's release a Supreme Court of Canada decision granted school attendees the right to pursue class-action suits, which ultimately led to a government review of the compensation process.|$|E
