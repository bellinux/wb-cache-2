5|$|Like {{the other}} {{specialized}} archipelago vessels, the hemmema had specific strengths and weaknesses. Although it had superior <b>firepower</b> relative to galleys, its sailing qualities were somewhat mediocre and while highly manoeuvrable under oars, {{it was still}} difficult to propel while rowed. A hemmema {{had the potential to}} be an effective weapon against galleys, matching their forward <b>firepower</b> and severely outgunning them with its broadside armament. Inside an enemy galley formation, it could wreak considerable havoc, but such a maneuver was never achieved in an actual battle, leaving that tactical role untested.|$|E
5|$|On several occasions, the M3 {{was mounted}} on PT boats to {{increase}} their <b>firepower.</b> One of these boats was John F. Kennedy's PT-109. The gun with its wheels removed was mounted on wooden planks nailed to the deck.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{the escape}} of the German fleet from the {{superior}} British <b>firepower</b> at Jutland was effected by the German cruisers and destroyers successfully turning away the British battleships, the German attempt {{to rely on}} U-boat attacks on the British fleet failed.|$|E
5|$|AFSOC {{provides}} Air Force {{special operations}} forces for worldwide deployment and assignment to regional unified commands. The command's SOF are composed of highly trained, rapidly deployable airmen, conducting global special operations missions ranging from precision application of <b>firepower</b> via airstrikes or close air support, to infiltration, exfiltration, resupply and refueling of SOF operational elements.|$|E
5|$|In the 1593 Siege of Pyongyang, 40,000 Ming troops {{deployed}} {{a variety}} of cannon to bombard an equally large Japanese army. Despite both forces having similar numbers, the Japanese were defeated in one day, due to the Ming advantage in <b>firepower.</b> Throughout the Seven Year War in Korea, the Chinese coalition used artillery widely, in both land and naval battles.|$|E
5|$|Later British super-dreadnoughts, principally the , {{dispensed}} with the midships turret, so weight and volume were freed for larger, oil-fired boilers. The new 15-inch (381-mm) gun gave greater <b>firepower</b> {{in spite of}} the loss of a turret, and there were a thicker armour belt and improved underwater protection. The class had a 25-knot (46-km/h) design speed, and they were considered the first fast battleships.|$|E
5|$|Marine Special Operations Support Group (MSOSG) trains, equips, structures, and {{provides}} specially qualified Marine forces, including, operational logistics, intelligence, Military Working Dogs, <b>Firepower</b> Control Teams, and communications support {{in order to}} sustain worldwide special operations missions as directed by Commander, U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (COMMARFORSOC).|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{displacement}} of a dreadnought was {{taken up by the}} steel plating of the armour. Designers spent much time and effort to provide the best possible protection for their ships against the various weapons they would be faced with. Only so much weight could be devoted to protection, without compromising speed, <b>firepower</b> or seakeeping.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 2011, {{the member}} state finance ministers agreed {{to expand the}} EFSF by {{creating}} certificates that could guarantee up to 30% of new issues from troubled euro-area governments, and to create investment vehicles that would boost the EFSF's <b>firepower</b> to intervene in primary and secondary bond markets.|$|E
5|$|On March 30, 1904, the ARF {{played a}} major role in the Sasun Uprising. The ARF sent arms and fedayi to defend the region for the second time. Among the 500 fedayees {{participating}} in the resistance were top figures such as Kevork Chavush, Sepasdatsi Murad and Hrayr Djoghk. They managed to hold off the Ottoman army for several months, despite their lack of fighters and <b>firepower.</b>|$|E
5|$|The First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54) saw the {{development}} of the line of battle, a tactic where ships formed a continuous line to fire broadsides at an enemy. Previously, naval tactics had favored short-range <b>firepower</b> and boarding with intent to take prizes. After the mid-17th century, tactics shifted from close-quarter fighting to disabling or sinking opponents through superior, long-distance <b>firepower.</b> This entailed major changes in doctrine, shipbuilding, and professionalism in European navies from the 1650s onwards. The line of battle favored large ships that were heavily armed and robust enough to hold the line in the face of enemy fire. The increased centralization and concentration of power in the emerging nation-states during the late 17th century allowed for a great expansion of armies and navies, and new government shipyards began building much much larger ships. Sweden embarked on an expansive shipbuilding program in the late 1660s.|$|E
5|$|Although the PanzerI would {{participate}} {{in almost every}} major Nationalist offensive of the war, the Nationalist army began to deploy more and more captured T-26 tanks to offset their disadvantage in protection and <b>firepower.</b> At one point, von Thoma offered up to 500pesetas for each T-26 captured. Although the Panzer I was initially able to knock out the T-26 at close range—150meters (165yd) or less—using an armor-piercing 7.92millimeter bullet, the Republican tanks began to engage at ranges where they were immune to the machine guns of the PanzerI.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} {{company at}} this time had a nominal strength of 20 officers and 275 other ranks. Larger than a conventional infantry company, it was organised into three platoons, each of three sections, each of which contained two subsections. It had considerable <b>firepower.</b> Each subsection had a Bren light machine gun. The gunner's two assistants carried rifles and extra 30-round Bren magazines. A sniper also carried a rifle, as did one man equipped with rifle grenades. The remaining four or five men carried Owen submachine guns. Each platoon also had a section of 2-inch mortars.|$|E
5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area where American <b>firepower</b> could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E
5|$|At 14:06 two UH-1E Huey {{helicopters}} carrying General Carey and Colonel Gray (commander of Regimental Landing Team 4 (RLT4)) {{landed at}} the DAO Compound. During {{their approach to}} the compound, Carey and Gray got a firsthand view of the PAVN's <b>firepower</b> as they shelled nearby Tan Son Nhut Airport with ground, rocket, and artillery fire. They quickly established an austere command post {{in preparation for the}} arrival of the Marine CH-53s and the ground security force.|$|E
5|$|Cannon also {{transformed}} naval warfare: the Royal Navy, in particular, {{took advantage}} of their <b>firepower.</b> As rifling became more commonplace, the accuracy of cannon was significantly improved, and they became deadlier than ever, especially to infantry. In World War I, a considerable majority of all deaths were caused by cannon; they were also used widely in World War II. Most modern cannon {{are similar to those}} used in the Second World War, including autocannon—with the exception of naval guns, which are now significantly smaller in caliber.|$|E
5|$|Chapman's {{archipelago}} frigates provided better {{protection for}} their crew than the galleys they replaced, {{and up to}} three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around skerries in all weathers and in open water {{in all but the}} worst storms. They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships. The new ship types also increased the archipelago fleet's <b>firepower,</b> provided it with better defensive capabilities, and made possible more efficient fire support in amphibious operations.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, it was {{proposed}} in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re-equipped with 4-inch guns but post-war defence cuts meant that this plan was abandoned. Instead, the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930. The continuing development of artillery <b>firepower</b> meant that the forts and batteries further downriver took on an increased responsibility for the forward defences of the Thames. The forts on Gravesend Reach were relegated to a second line of defence.|$|E
5|$|For Qin Jiwei, {{the lack}} of {{functioning}} communication networks and accurate intelligence prevented him from responding to the UN assaults. Because of his indecision, the 45th Division also received no artillery support against the UN attacks. In the face of devastating UN <b>firepower,</b> the Chinese defenders suffered 500 casualties per day during the initial UN onslaught. On October 17, after learning that more than 10 Chinese infantry companies were rendered combat ineffective, Cui Jiangong committed the remaining six infantry companies to a last-ditch counterattack. Aided by 44 large-caliber guns and a regiment of BM-13 rocket launchers, the elite 8th Company of the 134th Regiment attacked from the tunnels under Hill 598 while the other five infantry companies attacked across open ground at dusk on October 19. Their left wing drove the South Koreans off Sniper Ridge, but the US defenders on Triangle Hill held firm. At daybreak on October 20, UN <b>firepower</b> regained the upper hand and the Chinese were forced back into the tunnels after suffering heavy casualties. By the time Smith replaced the US 17th Infantry Regiment with the US 32nd Infantry Regiment {{on the afternoon of}} October 20, Qin Jiwei received reports that the 45th Division was completely decimated. The Chinese attacked Hill 598 again on the night of October 23 with two infantry companies, but the well entrenched US troops beat back the attack with little difficulty.|$|E
5|$|For {{ten minutes}} after the {{explosion}} there was no firing; sailors from both sides were either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. At 22:10, Franklin restarted the engagement by firing on Swiftsure. Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined <b>firepower</b> of Swiftsure and Defence. More than half of Franklins crew had been killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Hemmemas {{served in}} the Finnish squadrons during the war of 1788–1790. They {{supported}} amphibious operations and conducted raids on the Russian archipelago fleet, {{while at the same}} time acting as sea-borne flank support for the Swedish army on the Finnish mainland. Hemmemas fought in the first and second battles of Svensksund. During the first battle in 1789, one hemmema complemented the similar turumas, and in the second battle in July 1790, two hemmemas made up the defensive center and provided a considerable percentage of the <b>firepower.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, the 24th Division played an {{important}} part of Operation Desert Shield by providing heavy <b>firepower</b> with its large number of armored vehicles, including 216 M1A1 Abrams tanks. Elements of the division were still arriving in September, and in the logistical chaos that followed the rapid arrival of U.S. forces in the region, the soldiers of the 24th Division were housed in warehouses, airport hangars, and on the desert sand. The 24th remained in relatively stationary positions in defense of Saudi Arabia until additional American forces arrived for Operation Desert Storm.|$|E
5|$|Koniecpolski now {{recognized}} the need to reform his army and strengthen the <b>firepower</b> of its infantry and artillery to match the Swedes'. The Swedes, on the other hand, had learned the arts of cavalry charges and melée combat from the Poles. Overall the 1627 campaign had been favorable to the Commonwealth; Puck and Gniew had been retaken, Swedish plans had been thwarted, and the Swedish army had been weakened. The last major engagement of the year saw the surprising defeat of a Swedish flotilla by the small Polish Navy on 28 November 1627 at the Battle of Oliwa.|$|E
5|$|Land warfare {{changed from}} the static front lines of World WarI to {{increased}} mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon. In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced {{than it had been}} during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and <b>firepower.</b>|$|E
5|$|Manchester City manager Brian Horton, {{his former}} captain at Luton, paid Portsmouth £750,000 for Walsh's {{services}} in March 1994. With star striker Niall Quinn out injured, City were fourth from bottom with eleven Premier League games left {{to play and}} Walsh's strike partner Uwe Rösler was also a new signing – and had yet to learn English. The pair soon built an understanding however, {{and the arrival of}} wingers Peter Beagrie and Nicky Summerbee gave City the attacking <b>firepower</b> to steer clear of the relegation zone as Walsh and Rösler scored nine goals between them in the final ten games.|$|E
5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company had {{defeated}} {{the vanguard of}} Nakai's force and stopped his advance down the Markham Valley dead in its tracks. The Battle of Kaiapit accomplished Vasey's primary mission, for the Japanese could no longer threaten Nadzab. It opened {{the gate to the}} Ramu Valley for the 21st Infantry Brigade, provided new forward fighter airstrips for the air war against the Japanese, and validated the Australian Army's new training methods and the organisational emphasis on <b>firepower.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Belgians were afforded {{substantial}} support by the French Army. The French 1st Army included General René Prioux's Cavalry Corps. The Corps {{was given the}} 2nd Light Mechanized Division (2e Division Légère Mécanique, or 2e DLM) and the 3rd Light Mechanized Division (3e DLM), which were allocated to defend the Gembloux gap. The armoured forces consisted of 176 of the formidable SOMUA S35s and 239 Hotchkiss H35 light tanks. Both of these types, in armour and <b>firepower,</b> were superior to most German types. The 3e DLM contained 90 S35s and some 140 H35s alone.|$|E
5|$|The Iowa {{class has}} become {{culturally}} symbolic in the United States {{in many different}} ways, {{to the point where}} certain elements of the American public—such as the United States Naval Fire Support Association—are unwilling to part with the battleships despite their apparent obsolescence in the face of modern naval combat doctrine that places great emphasis on air supremacy and missile <b>firepower.</b> Although all have been officially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register they have been spared scrapping and were donated for use as museum ships.|$|E
5|$|The Light Tank Mk VII (A17), {{also known}} as the Tetrarch, was a British light tank {{produced}} by Vickers-Armstrongs in the late 1930s and deployed during the Second World War. The Tetrarch was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army. It improved upon its predecessor, the Mk VIB Light Tank, by introducing the extra <b>firepower</b> of a 2-pounder gun. The War Office ordered 70 tanks, an order that eventually increased to 220. Production was delayed by several factors, and as a consequence, only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced.|$|E
5|$|The Portland {{class were}} also {{designed}} with more advanced armament in mind. Their main guns {{were the first}} to be specially designed to fire long-point projectiles with a streamlined shape, which increased the guns' range when compared with older cruiser guns. Such projectiles were in use by ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, which until that point out-ranged U.S. cruisers with their <b>firepower.</b> The New Orleans class was designed with these lessons in mind, intended to create a better balance between protection, armament and speed.|$|E
5|$|The Tripolitan vessel, Tripoli, and Enterprise {{were quite}} evenly matched. Enterprise, with a {{complement}} of 90, was a 12-gun, 135-ton schooner built in 1799 that had seen {{action in the}} Quasi-War. In contrast, Tripoli, a lateen-rigged polacca with two masts, was crewed by 80men under Admiral Rais Mahomet Rous and armed with 14guns. Although the Tripolitans held a slight advantage in <b>firepower,</b> Enterprise had to its advantage the larger crew and the element of surprise. The Americans were also significantly more experienced in gunnery action than the Tripolitans, who preferred to attack by boarding and taking over their opponents' ships.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Marine Corps {{tested the}} M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle, a lighter, magazine-fed rifle to {{supplement}} and partially replace the M249. With {{plans to buy}} up to 4,100 IARs to complement and partially replace its 10,000 M249s (of which 8,000 will remain in service) held at platoon level, it acquired 450 of the Heckler & Koch HK416–based weapons for testing. The Marines started fielding the M27 in 2010, but kept both weapons in the inventory due to the M249's greater ammunition capacity and higher sustained fire rate; rifle companies are typically issued 27 IARs and six SAWs. The U.S. Army does not plan to introduce the IAR. Colonel Robert Radcliffe of the U.S. Army Infantry Research and Development Center stated that an automatic rifle with a magazine would lower the effectiveness and <b>firepower</b> of a squad. While the Marine Corps has 13-man squads, the Army organizes its soldiers into squads of nine and needs considerably more <b>firepower</b> from the squad machine gunners {{to make up the}} difference. The U.S. Army does, however, want to replace aging M249s with newer weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of new Soviet tanks {{such as the}} T-80B during the late 1970s and early 1980s demanded {{the development of new}} technologies and weapons to counter the threat posed to Western armor. The T-80B had increased <b>firepower</b> and a new composite ceramic armor. The T-72 also went through a modernization program in an attempt to bring it up to the standards of the T-80B. In 1985 the new T-72B version entered production, with a new laminate armor protection system; its turret armor, designed primarily to defeat anti-tank missiles, surpassed the T-80B's in protection.|$|E
5|$|The {{barrels of}} the Chinese cannon {{are on display}} at <b>Firepower</b> - The Royal Artillery Museum at Woolwich. The {{remaining}} portion of the only remaining cascabel, weighing 358 oz (10kg), is stored in a vault maintained by 15 Regiment Royal Logistic Corps at MoD Donnington. It can only be removed under armed guard. It is estimated that approximately 80 to 85 more VCs could be cast from this source.|$|E
5|$|The entire 24th Division {{gathered}} {{to make a}} final stand around Taejon, holding a line along the Kum River {{to the east of}} the city. Hampered by a lack of communication and equipment, and a shortage of heavy weapons to match the KPA's <b>firepower,</b> the outnumbered, ill-equipped and untrained American forces were pushed back from the riverbank after several days before fighting an intense urban battle to defend the city. After a fierce three-day struggle, the Americans withdrew.|$|E
5|$|The initial attack hit {{the forward}} {{operating}} base's mortar pit, knocking out the 120mm mortar and detonating the stockpile of mortar ammunition. The insurgents next destroyed the Humvee-mounted TOW missile launcher inside the combat outpost with coordinated fire from unguided RPG rockets. The mortars and TOW launcher which were {{to provide the}} heaviest and most accurate <b>firepower</b> had been quickly taken out by the attackers. The explosion of the mortar shells hurled the anti-tank missiles into the command post.|$|E
