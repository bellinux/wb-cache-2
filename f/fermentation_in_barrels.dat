40|$|In {{the current}} study, the major {{volatile}} compounds from {{three categories of}} traditional fruit brandies (plum, apple and pear) were characterized by gas-chromatography (GC-FID). There were collected 26 samples from different locations of Transylvania (Romania), all made by traditional technologies involving <b>fermentation</b> <b>in</b> <b>barrels</b> and distillation in copper stills. The major volatile compounds, besides ethanol, identified and quantified were: acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, methanol, 1 -propanol, 2 -butanol, iso-butylic alcohol, alcool amyl active, iso-amylic alcohol, 1 -butanol and furfural. For each type of brandy, positive but no significant correlations between methanol and furfural concentrations in plum and apple brandy were noticed. To evaluate the differences in composition regarding the geographical origin of plum brandies and to analyze the composition of plum, apple and pear brandies it has been compared the mean values (MVP, MVA and MVPe) obtained for each volatile. For plum brandies {{it has been observed}} differences among the mean values of each volatile, in samples originating from counties Cluj, Bistriţa-Năsăud and Maramureş. For methanol, acetaldehyde and 1 -propanol the MVP Cluj values were significantly higher than MVP Bistriţa-Năsăud. For iso-butylic alcohol, amyl active alcohol, iso-amylic alcohol the MVP Cluj values were significantly higher than for Bistriţa-Năsăud and Maramureş, while for ethyl acetate and furfural the MVP Bistriţa-Năsăud were significantly higher than MVP Cluj and MVP Maramureş. When compared the mean values of volatiles in plum vs apple vs pear brandies, for ethyl acetate, methanol, 2 -butanol, 1 -propanol and 1 -butanol, the MVPe values were significantly higher than MVA, for furfural, amyl active and iso-amylic alcohols, while for acetaldehyde the MVPe values were significantly higher than MVP. Methanol represented the major volatile component, characteristic to fruit brandies, released by enzymatic degradation of methoxylated pectins. Therefore, this molecule can be considered not only a parameter of distillate safety but also an indicator of natural origin of distillate and traditional processing. <br /...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study was conducted}} on nine batches of wine taken from the same initial wine, subjected to malolactic <b>fermentation</b> and ageing <b>in</b> <b>barrels,</b> under different technological, conditions: malolactic <b>fermentation</b> <b>in</b> <b>barrel</b> or <b>in</b> tank, with or without wine clarification, ageing with or without lees, and stirring or no stirring of the lees. Samples were taken of the initial wine, of the wine {{at the end of}} malolactic fermentation, of the wines after clarifying treatments, and after 3, 6, 9, 12 and 14 months of ageing <b>in</b> the <b>barrel,</b> making a total of 51 wines. Only a very small decrease in amino acids was observed during malolactic fermentation, probably due to the wine releasing amino acids produced by the exocellular proteasic activity of the lactic acid bacteria. Ageing of the wine with lees modifies its nitrogen composition because amino acids are released by yeast and bacteria autolysis. The amount of amino acids released was greatest in the wines stirred weekly. All of the wines studied contained low concentrations of biogenic amines.

As a result of the anthocyanin analysis of all the wines studied, a total of 21 different anthocyanin compounds were detected, which can be classified into four groups: simple glucosides, acetyl glucosides, cinnamoyl glucosides and pyroanthocyanins. During MLF, it was shown that the effect of the container used seems to be more important than the metabolic activity of the bacteria responsible for the process. From application of the LSD test, significant differences were found in the concentrations of all the anthocyanin compounds identified due to ageing time and significant differences were also revealed for most anthocyanin compounds in relation to the manufacturing method, especially {{the presence or absence of}} lees.

5000|$|The {{secret of}} the Spreewald gherkins' special taste {{remained}} hidden, even to the satirist Fontane. Certainly, the moist soil, rich in humus, and the climate in the Spreewald {{also contribute to the}} good growth in the cucumber fields.

While the process of <b>fermentation</b> <b>in</b> large <b>barrels</b> formerly took several weeks, gherkins today are ready for sale after only one day of processing—whether for mustard gherkins (Senfgurke), gherkins or dill pickles (Gewürzgurke) or pickled cucumbers (Salzgurke).

5|$|One of {{the most}} noted traits of Cabernet Sauvignon is its {{affinity}} for oak, either during <b>fermentation</b> or <b>in</b> <b>barrel</b> aging. <b>In</b> addition to having a softening effect on the grape's naturally high tannins, the unique wood flavors of vanilla and spice complement the natural grape flavors of blackcurrant and tobacco. The particular success of Cabernet-based Bordeaux blends in the 225 liter (59 gallon) barrique were a significant influence <b>in</b> making that <b>barrel</b> size one {{of the most}} popular worldwide. In winemaking, the decision for the degree of oak influence (as well as which type of oak) will have a strong impact on the resulting wine. American oak, particularly from new barrels, imparts stronger oak flavors that are less subtle than those imparted by French oak. Even within the American oak family, the location of the oak source also plays a role with oak from the state of Oregon having more pronounced influence on Cabernet Sauvignon than oak from Missouri, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Winemakers often use a variety of oak barrels from different locations and of different ages and blend the wine as if they are blending different grape varieties.|$|R
40|$|Publication Date (Web) : June 21, 2014 Chardonnay {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most widely {{distributed}} wine grape cultivars and is of commercial importance for the world's wine-producing nations. It is an extremely flexible variety that has adapted to different regions with varied weather and soil characteristics. Somewhat uniquely among white wines, Chardonnay lends itself to a wide variety of production styles, which can be tailored to the target market. Techniques such as skin maceration, barrel and stainless steel fermentation, use of selected or indigenous yeasts, malolactic <b>fermentation,</b> and aging <b>in</b> <b>barrels</b> with or without lees are all applicable and lead to different compositional outcomes. A number of research papers have been published with a view to understanding Chardonnay composition and quality as well as the impact of different enological techniques on the final product.
