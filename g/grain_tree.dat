40|$|Scheduling {{parallel}} tasks on an unbounded {{number of}} completely connected processors when communication overhead is {{taken into account}} is NP-complete. Assuming that task duplication is not allowed, we propose a fast heuristic algorithm, called the dominant sequence clustering algorithm (DSC), for this scheduling problem. The DSC algorithm is superior to several other algorithms from the literature {{in terms of both}} computational complexity and parallel time. We present experimental results for scheduling general directed acyclic task graphs (DAGs) and compare the performance of several algorithms. Moreover, we show that DSC is optimum for special classes of DAGs such as join, fork and coarse <b>grain</b> <b>tree</b> graphs. 1 Introduction Scheduling parallel tasks with precedence relations over distributed memory multiprocessors {{has been found to be}} much more difficult than the classical scheduling problem, see Graham [14] and Lenstra and Kan [15].

40|$|Background: RNAMute is an {{interactive}} Java application that calculates the secondary structure of all single point mutations, given an RNA sequence, and organizes them into categories {{according to their}} similarity {{with respect to the}} wild type predicted structure. The secondary structure predictions are performed using the Vienna RNA package. Several alternatives are used for the categorization of single point mutations: Vienna's RNAdistance based on dot-bracket representation, as well as tree edit distance and second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix based on Shapiro's coarse <b>grain</b> <b>tree</b> graph representation. Results: Selecting a category in each one of the processed tables lists all single point mutations belonging to that category. Selecting a mutation displays a graphical drawing of the single point mutation and the wild type, and includes basic information such as associated energies, representations and distances. RNAMute can be used successfully with very little previous experience and without choosing any parameter value alongside the initial RNA sequence. The package runs under LINUX operating system. Conclusion: RNAMute is a user friendly tool {{that can be used to}} predict single point mutation...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} low {{complexity}} heuristic named the Dominant Sequence Clustering algorithm (DSC) for scheduling parallel tasks on an unbounded number of completely connected processors. The performance of DSC is comparable or even better on average {{than many other}} higher complexity algorithms. We assume no task duplication and nonzero communication overhead between processors. Finding the optimum solution for arbitrary directed acyclic task graphs (DAGs) is NP-complete. DSC finds optimal schedules for special classes of DAGs such as fork, join, coarse <b>grain</b> <b>trees</b> and some fine <b>grain</b> <b>trees.</b> It guarantees a performance within a factor {{of two of the}} optimum for general coarse grain DAGs. We compare DSC with three higher complexity general scheduling algorithms, the MD by Wu and Gajski [19], the ETF by Hwang, Chow, Anger and Lee [12] and Sarkar's clustering algorithm [17]. We also give a sample of important practical applications where DSC has been found useful. Index Terms [...] Clustering, dire [...] ...|$|R

Several alternatives are used for the categorization of single point mutations: Vienna's RNAdistance based on dot-bracket representation, as well as tree edit distance and second eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix based on Shapiro's coarse <b>grain</b> <b>tree</b> graph representation.

RNAMute can be used successfully with very little previous experience and without choosing any parameter value alongside the initial RNA sequence. The package runs under LINUX operating system. Conclusion RNAMute is a user friendly tool {{that can be used to}} predict single point mutations leading to conformational rearrangements in the secondary structure of RNAs. In several cases of substantial interest, notably in virology, a point mutation may lead to a loss of important functionality such as the RNA virus replication and translation initiation because of a conformational rearrangement in the secondary structure. </p...|$|E

With 65 % of Nigerian’s considered food insecure, and a rapidly growing population, there are calls for a more sustainable food security policy. In order to highlight local prospects and encourage the recognition of Indigenous food and knowledge, this qualitative case study focused on the Irigwe Indigenous food system, from Kwall community, in Bassa Local Government Area (LGA), Plateau State, Nigeria. Interviews and talking circle were conducted for 30 participants {{to collect data on}} the Irigwe Indigenous food system: their food and its nutritional and medicinal value, the challenges that the people encounter in their bid to access their food and their insights on how their community’s food security can be improved. Participants were able to identify 23 Indigenous foods (<b>grains,</b> <b>tree</b> plants, vegetables and fish) they utilize for nutritional and medicinal purposes. Ibre (Eleusine coracana) and riti (Vernonia amygdalina) are examples of some foods with nutritional, medicinal and cultural significance. 18 participants said they use their food for both nutritional and medicinal value. Subsistence farming is the dominant means by which participants access their food. 10 participants access their food exclusively through farming. Other means of accessing food include wild food harvesting, sharing, exchange and purchase. Among all the challenges participants face in accessing their food, human insecurity is the dominant challenge facing participants. Other challenges include environmental challenges, threats to Indigenous species and developmental challenges. Participants suggested that dry season farming should be made more accessible, and traditional farming techniques should be more innovative in order to attain sustainable food security in households and the community at large. They would also want to participate in policy discussions and programme implementation...|$|R
