40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the antiemetic effect of aprepitant and to determine how to provide triple combination therapy (aprepitant/azasetron/dexamethasone) to women receiving paclitaxel/carboplatin moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The current study was a prospective study of 163 women with gynecologic cancers. We compared the digestive symptoms scores (nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, and dietary intake) of 37 women with ovarian cancers before and after aprepitant administration. We also compared these symptoms in women who underwent 193 cycles of triple combination therapy with symptoms of women who underwent 226 cycles of <b>double</b> <b>combination</b> <b>therapy.</b> For triple combination therapy, azasetron, dexamethasone (reduced dose: 40 % of 20 mg), and aprepitant (125 mg) were administered on Day 1, followed by only aprepitant (80 mg) administration on Days 2 and Day 3. RESULTS: In 37 women with ovarian cancer, three symptoms, nausea, appetite loss, and dietary intake, were significantly improved by primarily adding aprepitant to <b>double</b> <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> in the delayed phase of MEC. Upon comparing their digestive symptoms in all cycles, however, these three symptoms were not significantly different in the delayed phase. Furthermore, all four symptoms in all cycles were worse following triple combination therapy than following <b>double</b> <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> in the acute phase (p< 0. 02). The control of digestive symptoms was generally insufficient without the administration of dexamethasone. CONCLUSIONS: Primary aprepitant as an addition to MEC demonstrated efficacy in improving digestive symptoms in the delayed phase. However, its effect may decrease with repeated use. To improve the antiemetic effect, the dose reduction of dexamethasone should be restricted on Day 1 and dexamethasone should be used throughout the delayed phase as well...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to assess to which extent treated human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type I (HIV- 1) infected patients with a seemingly controlled, defined as undetectable plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels (< 50 copies/ml), or low-grade viral replication, exhibited pattems in virological and immunological factors which could suggest {{a continuation of the}} disease process. We have therefore analysed the kinetics of HIV- 1 DNA levels (Papers I and II), the viral evolution (Paper II), the changes in Beta-chemokine levels (Paper 111) and sCD 27 levels (Paper IV), and the appearance of drug resistance associated mutations (Paper V) in such patients. The HIV- 1 DNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were analysed by a competitive PCR assay in patients with triple (n= 37) or <b>double</b> <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> (n= 11) and in 10 untreated patients during one year (Paper 1). In patients on triple therapy, a significant decline of the HIV- I DNA load was seen, independent of whether it was expressed as copies/ 106 CD 4 + cells or copies/nil blood. In contrast, in patients given two drugs, a decline was only seen when the proviral load was expressed as copies/ 106 CD 4 + cells. During a prolonged follow-up period of up to 30 months in patients with undetectable plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels, the cellular HIV- 1 DNA levels continued to decrease and the frequency of patients with undetectable proviral DNA increased. Also, sequence changes in the V 3 region of the major viral population, as signs of ongoing viral replication, were monitored in Paper H. Of 18 patients with viral suppression to < 50 copies/ml, variations of the V 3 sequences were observed in 10 patients. 69 % of these changes occurred in the first sample interval after initiation of therapy. The kinetics of the beta-chemokines, MIP- 1 alpha, MIP- 1 beta, RANTES and MCP- 1, in plasma during one year of therapy (n= 26) and in untreated subjects (n= 11) were studied by ELISA (Paper III). During therapy, decreases of MCP- 1 and RANTES levels were found, while no durable changes of MIP- 1 alpha, and MIP- 10 were seen. The MCP- 1 levels rebounded back to baseline after one year despite a good virological response. Plasma levels of sCD 27 were measured by ELISA during two years of therapy in 26 patients and in additional seven patients after interruption of therapy (Paper IV). A full normalisation of plasma sCD 27 levels was observed in responders with HIV- 1 RNA < 50 copies/ml and in patients with moderate immunodeficiency. Discontinuation of therapy resulted in a rapid increase of sCD 27 plasma levels, associated with viral rebound. Crosssectional examination on lymphocytes from 36 subjects showed a reduced cellular expression of CD 27, which was further decreased in patients on combination therapy. The pol gene was analysed by direct sequencing in 14 patients who had an initial treatment response of a viral load < 500 copies/ml, but who thereafter had a viral rebound to a low-grade viremia. During up to 30 months of follow-up, new primary resistance associated mutations in RT or protease appeared in 11 and 9 patients, respectively, despite concomitantly increasing CD 4 + T cell counts. Drug-resistance was even detected in a patient with HIV- I RNA < 50 copies/ml. Further mutations accumulated frequently after the initial mutations. Our data suggest that the viral replication can be highly restricted and that measures of immune activation can normalise during two-three years of antiretroviral combination therapy in patients with plasma HIV- 1 RNA levels < 50 copies/ml. However, the disease process may continue in some patients. A low-grade viremia can be sufficient to allow drug-resistance mutations, which may exhaust future drug-options. Thus, currently used anti-HIV- 1 therapy is frequently very efficient, but it is still possible to further improve the virological and immmunological effects in otherwise successfully treated individuals...|$|E
40|$|The anti-tumor effects {{associated}} with oncolytic virus therapy are mediated significantly through immune-mediated mechanisms which depends {{both on the}} type of virus and the route of delivery. Here, we show that intra-tumoral (i. t.) oncolysis by Reovirus induced the priming of a CD 8 +, Th 1 -type anti-tumor response. In contrast, systemically delivered VSV expressing a cDNA library of melanoma antigens (VSV-ASMEL) promoted a potent anti-tumor CD 4 + Th 17 response. Therefore, we hypothesised that combining the Reovirus-induced CD 8 + T cell response, with the VSV-ASMEL CD 4 + Th 17 helper response, would produce enhanced anti-tumor activity. Consistent with this, priming with i. t. Reovirus, followed by an intra-venous VSV-ASMEL Th 17 boost, significantly improved survival of mice bearing established subcutaneous (s. c.) B 16 melanoma tumors. We also show that <b>combination</b> of either <b>therapy</b> alone with anti-PD- 1 immune checkpoint blockade augmented both the Th 1 response induced by systemically delivered Reovirus in combination with GM-CSF, and also the Th 17 response induced by VSV-ASMEL. Significantly, anti-PD- 1 also uncovered an anti-tumor Th 1 response following VSV-ASMEL treatment that was not seen in the absence of checkpoint blockade. Finally, the combination of all three treatments (priming with systemically delivered Reovirus, followed by double boosting with systemic VSV-ASMEL and anti-PD- 1) significantly enhanced survival, with long-term cures, compared to any individual, or <b>double,</b> <b>combination</b> <b>therapies,</b> {{associated with}} strong Th 1 and Th 17 responses to tumor antigens. Our data show {{that it is possible to}} generate fully systemic, highly effective anti-tumor immunovirotherapy by combining oncolytic viruses, along with immune checkpoint blockade, to induce complimentary mechanisms of anti-tumor immune responses...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveIn this study, we modify {{previously}} published models {{to estimate the}} short- and long-term consequences of nevirapine triple <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> use in five developed countries. Current pharmacoeconomic practice requires the de novo model development for each new therapy comparison. This approach is lengthy and costly, and it may yield models with very different structures. Standardized, detailed disclosure of model assumptions and parameters {{makes it possible to}} recycle published models with minor structural modifications to examine the efficiency of therapies based on new trial data. MethodsTwo well-publicized models of HIV therapy are modified to fit new trial data comparing <b>double</b> and triple <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> with nevirapine; model parameters are adjusted to represent clinical practice and cost structure in five countries. A short-term model uses trial data from advanced-stage patients to estimate first-year costs and consequences. A long-term model uses data from antiretroviral-naïve patients to estimate long-term cost-effectiveness. ResultsDuring the first year, for each 100 individuals treated with nevirapine triple <b>combination</b> <b>therapy,</b> 2. 7 deaths and 30. 8 – 31. 4 opportunistic disease events would be averted compared to employing dual therapy. Additionally, 61 % to 142 % of the first-year costs of nevirapine therapy would be offset by other medical care costs savings [FF 19, 749, DM 3, 778, 3334 (× 1000) lire, 293 (× 1000) ptas, and US $ 3, 569]. Compared to dual <b>combination</b> <b>therapy,</b> nevirapine triple <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> is predicted to yield incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (discounted at 3 %) of FF 101, 057, DM 30, 709, 28, 066 (× 1000) lire, 1294 (× 1000) ptas, and US $ 14, 338. ConclusionPublished, well-constructed, and documented cost-effectiveness models can be reused to estimate the economic impact of therapies for HIV disease. Such models {{can also be used to}} provide insight into the factors that affect efficiency across countries. Our use of clinical trial data on nevirapine, together with published HIV economic models, provides support for the hypothesis that nevirapine is cost-effective under the cost structures of five developed countries...|$|R
40|$|Three or more {{therapeutic}} {{agents have}} commonly {{been used to}} treat chronic infections and many malignant diseases. It is clear that monotherapy treatment of HIV infection, although effective in the short term, is not a viable long-term management option because of incomplete suppression of viral replication and the subsequent development of viral resistance. It is therefore generally accepted that multidrug <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> represents the most promising strategy for HIV management. The rationale for this approach {{is based on an}} understanding of viral pathogenesis and preliminary results from in vitro studies. It is anticipated that <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> will achieve greater reductions in viral load, leading to reduced rates of viral replication and diversification, which, in turn, will result in the delayed emergence of drug-resistant and cytopathic variants. This will probably result in the prevention of both immune system destruction and subsequent disease progression. Preliminary in vitro studies have provided evidence that <b>double</b> <b>combinations</b> are more effective than monotherapy. In vivo results from clinical trials comparing <b>double</b> <b>combinations</b> with monotherapy, however, have not been as impressive as expected, and show that suppression of viral replication, even with two drugs, is incomplete. Further in vitro evidence from sensitivity studies suggests that triple combinations {{are likely to be more}} effective. Further clinical trials of the most promising combinations need to be conducted. however, the selection of these combinations is not an easy task owing to the large number of possible regimens to choose from. The Inter-Company Collaboration on AIDS Drug Development, among others, has established protocols for rapid identification of promising combinations that should make this task easier.

40|$|The {{spread of}} carbapenem-non-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae strains bearing {{different}} resistance determinants is a rising problem worldwide. Especially infections with KPC (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase) - producers {{are associated with}} high mortality rates due to limited treatment options. Recent clinical studies of KPC-blood stream infections revealed that colistin-based <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> with a carbapenem and/or tigecycline was associated with significantly decreased mortality rates when compared to colistin monotherapy. However, it remains unclear if these observations can be transferred to K. pneumoniae harboring other mechanisms of carbapenem resistance.

The ability of mexiletine monotherapy, quinidine monotherapy and mexiletine-quinidine <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> to suppress inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia was related to drug-induced changes in ventricular refractoriness, conduction times and monophasic action potential duration recorded from both ventricles. Ventricular tachycardia could no longer be induced in 7 (35 %) of the 20 patients studied with <b>combination</b> <b>therapy.</b> This was a significantly higher proportion of patients than that of the groups responding to either monotherapy (quinidine, 10 %; mexiletine, 5 %). Ventricular effective and functional refractory periods were measured when applying single (S 2), double (S 3) and triple (S 4) extrastimuli. Quinidine monotherapy increased functional and effective refractory periods of both single and multiple extrastimuli. However, when comparing measurements made during mexiletine treatment with those at baseline, mexiletine monotherapy increased only the refractory periods of S 4. The effective refractory period of S 4 during mexiletine monotherapy (200 ± 20 ins) was significantly longer than at baseline (160 ± 21 ms). Similarly, when comparing measurements made during <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> with those during quinidine monotherapy, <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> significantly increased the refractory periods only of multiple extrastimuli.

40|$|Background: To date, {{clinical}} trials have reported inconsistent {{results on the}} efficacy of the <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> of Memantine plus an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) over a single-drug therapy in the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. This meta-analysis aim is to assess {{the efficacy of the}} <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> of Memantine plus an AChEI in the treatment of Alzheimer s disease compared with a single-drug therapy using an AChEI. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library databases were searched through December 2013. Seven randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. A random-effects meta-analysis was used. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed. Results: A <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> of an AChEI with memantine was associated with modestly better effects in terms of cognition and global function compared to a monotherapy with an AChEI. The effects of the <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> were no better than a monotherapy for daily living activity. However, the <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> showed benefits over a monotherapy for the behavioral outcome and the effect was independent of the stage of the disease. Moreover, the rate of adverse effects did not differ between a <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> and a single therapy. Conclusions: The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that the <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> is more appropriate and should be administered for patients in more advanced stages. However, not all patients may benefit from the combination treatment. Identification of subgroups of patients with Alzheimer s disease who will benefit more from the combination treatment is needed...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims Treatment {{of chronic}} {{hepatitis}} C with interferon can be ineffective due to relapse. We aimed {{to reduce the}} 40 % relapse rate of 6 months interferon-ribavirin <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> by prolonging treatment to 18 months. Methods Three hundred patients with treatment-naive hepatitis C, were randomized to 18 months <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> with interferon (3 MU tiw) and ribavirin (1000 - 1200 mg/day), 18 months interferon combined with placebo, or 6 months <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> with interferon and ribavirin, in a double blinded manner. All 295 patients who received at least one dose of treatment {{were included in the}} intention to treat analysis. Results At the end of treatment, HCV RNA was undetectable in 55 and 49 % of those on 6 and 18 months <b>combination</b> <b>therapy,</b> respectively, versus 26 % of those on monotherapy (P< 0. 001). The relapse rate was 38 % for 6 months <b>combination</b> <b>therapy,</b> 38 % for 18 months monotherapy, and only 13 % for 18 months combination treatment (P= 0. 002). The sustained response rates were 34 % for 6 months <b>combination</b> <b>therapy,</b> 16 % for 18 months monotherapy and 43 % for 18 months <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> (P< 0. 05). Conclusions Reduction of relapse rates to 15 % or less is feasible by prolongation of interferon-ribavirin treatment to 18 months. © 2004 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

40|$|Background:N-methyl-D-aspartic acid antagonists (memantine) and cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are {{the only}} two {{approved}} classes of drugs to treat dementia; this paper explores the evidence for using these two treatments in combination. Objective: To determine the efficacy and safety of using <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> with memantine and a ChEI to treat dementia in comparison to monotherapy with either memantine or a ChEI. Methods: In March 2012, we systematically searched MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and grey literature databases. All study types were included, except for case series or reports, which looked at <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> versus monotherapy in various dementing disorders. Data was pooled for blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) only; mean differences and standardized mean differences were used to determine effect sizes. Results: Thirteen studies were included in this review; 3 were blinded RCTs, with a total of 971 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, which were included into the meta-analysis. No papers were found that primarily addressed <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> in other dementias. In the meta-analysis, small but statistically significant effect sizes were seen in favor of <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> among patients with moderate to severe AD on the scales of cognition (0. 45 – 0. 52; p Conclusion: Although there were statistically significant changes in favor of <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> in moderate to severe AD, heterogeneity in scales and patient characteristics exists. However, it is unclear if clinically significant outcomes can be achieved using the <b>combination</b> <b>therapy.</b> More studies are required before a recommendation for <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> can be made...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Because it {{increases}} the risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension is one of most important causes of mortality. To achieve a target blood pressure of 140 / 90 mmHg, many patients with hypertension require <b>combination</b> <b>therapy.</b> One useful option is a fixed-dose combination of olmesartan and amlodipine. For example, the COACH trial showed that using these drugs in long-term <b>combination</b> <b>therapy,</b> rather than in monotherapy, had many advantages including a lower incidence of adverse events and stronger antihyperten-sive potency. Numerous other clinical trials have supported these findings for olmesartan and amlodipine <b>combination</b> <b>therapy.</b> Given these results, we conclude that <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> with olmesartan and amlodipine is clinically useful for the treatment of blood pressure control and may improve target organ protection...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) is a complex, progressive disease with several pathobiological mechanisms, including the endothelin, nitric oxide and prostacyclin pathways. Current treatments for PAH target {{one of these}} pathways and, in more severe cases or instances of disease worsening, may be combined {{with a view to}} target multiple pathways in parallel. Treatment combination is performed sequentially (as an intensification from initial monotherapy) or upfront (use of two or more therapies in treatment-naı¨ve patients). Whilst <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> has been historically considered to be an option for the treatment of PAH, supporting evidence was typically limited to expert opinion, clinical experience and registry data. Data from randomised controlled trials on sequential <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> in particular has grown in recent years, resulting in a change in the level of recommendations in the latest update to the PAH treatment algorithm. However, short-term trials have shown inconsistent results, and have not been powered to assess morbidity/mortality outcomes. More recent data from long-term trials suggest a potential clinical benefit associated with sequential <b>combination</b> <b>therapy.</b> In this review we will introduce the concept of <b>combination</b> <b>therapy,</b> consider the latest evidence for both sequential and upfront <b>combination</b> <b>therapy,</b> and discuss additional considerations when initiating <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Summary: The {{increasing}} {{emergence of}} antimicrobial-resistant organisms, especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), {{has resulted in}} the increased use of rifampin <b>combination</b> <b>therapy.</b> The data supporting rifampin <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> in nonmycobacterial infections are limited by a lack of significantly controlled clinical studies. Therefore, its current use is based upon in vitro or in vivo data or retrospective case series, all with major limitations. A prominent observation from this review is that rifampin <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> appears to have improved treatment outcomes in cases {{in which there is a}} low organism burden, such as biofilm infections, but is less effective when effective surgery to obtain source control is not performed. The clinical data support rifampin <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections due to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) after extensive debridement and for the treatment of prosthetic heart valve infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci. Importantly, rifampin-vancomycin <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> has not shown any benefit over vancomycin monotherapy against MRSA infections either clinically or experimentally. Rifampin <b>combination</b> <b>therapy</b> with daptomycin, fusidic acid, and linezolid needs further exploration for these severe MRSA infections. Lastly, an assessment of the risk-benefits is needed before the addition of rifampin to other antimicrobials is considered to avoid drug interactions or other drug toxicities...|$|R

40|$|For {{a growing}} number of indications, <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> are {{becoming}} increasingly common due in part to their superior efficacy, as compared to monotherapies. In fact, in the case of infectious diseases such as AIDS and tuberculosis, <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> are now the standard of care. With the emergence of drug-device combinations, genetic testing, and individualized medicine, this trend towards <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> is likely to continue to grow. In this context the pricing of <b>combination</b> <b>therapies</b> is a critical component that needs to be understood by medical practitioners, payors and policy makers. There are three factors to consider in the pricing of combination therapies: the characteristics and structure of the market in which the combined product is sold, the absence or presence of market exclusivity, and the prices of the components of the combined product, when sold individually. When {{one or more of the}} components of the combined product has market exclusivity, additional factors such as exclusionary bundling, tying, and double marginalization may come into play. (cont.) In this thesis I discuss <b>combination</b> <b>therapies,</b> describe the factors that can affect the pricing of <b>combination</b> <b>therapies,</b> and then attempt to identify the relationships among component pricing, market forces, market exclusivity and the pricing of <b>combination</b> <b>therapies.</b> To illustrate these relationships empirically, I will analyze data from a sample of unified combined drugs, a subset of <b>combination</b> <b>therapies.</b> The results of this analysis are consistent with a hypothesis that, for combination drugs with a patented ingredient, the elimination of double marginalization by efficient transfer pricing and economic and exclusionary bundling, lowers the price of the unified combination drug relative to the price of its constituents. b y Sundar Subramaniam.
