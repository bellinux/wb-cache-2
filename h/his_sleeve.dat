With {{two other}} Jedi masters at his side, Windu {{attempts}} to arrest Palpatine, but Palpatine produces a lightsaber from <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> and quickly dispatches all but Windu. Palpatine engages Windu in a duel and fires Force lightning at him, but Windu deflects the lightning back at its source, deforming Palpatine's {{face into the}} gray, wizened visage seen in the original trilogy. Just as Windu is about to dispatch Palpatine, Anakin appears and intervenes on the Sith lord's behalf, allowing Palpatine to kill Windu with another blast of lightning. Anakin then pledges himself {{to the dark side}} as Palpatine's new Sith apprentice, Darth Vader.|$|E
5|$|Milhouse {{rolls over}} the side of the treehouse, but Bart catches him precariously by <b>his</b> <b>sleeve.</b> When a gale of wind takes hold of the comic so that it flies towards the treehouse's {{entrance}}, Bart is forced to decide between it and Milhouse. After mulling over his options, Bart chooses Milhouse and pulls him up into the treehouse. The comic flies out the entrance and is shredded by Santa's Little Helper on the ground, hit by lightning, and completely destroyed. The next morning, the three boys reflect on how their inability to share led to the destruction of the comic, although Bart, has forgotten the experience.|$|E

25|$|During the hearings, a {{photograph}} of Schine was introduced, and Joseph Welch accused Cohn of doctoring the image to show Schine alone with Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens. On the witness stand Cohn and Schine both insisted that the picture entered into evidence (Schine and Stevens alone) was requested by Stevens {{and that no one}} was edited out of the photograph. Welch then produced a wider shot of Stevens and Schine with McGuire AFB wing commander Colonel Jack Bradley standing to Schine's right. A fourth person also edited out of the picture (<b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> was visible to Bradley's right in the Welch photograph) was identified as McCarthy aide Frank Carr.|$|E
25|$|Although {{no details}} were given on how Chen Wu {{died at the}} Battle of Xiaoyao Ford in 215, his death was dramatised in chapter 68 of the {{historical}} novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong, which romanticises the historical events {{before and during the}} Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, Chen Wu encountered Pang De (who had recently joined Cao Cao's forces) in another battle right after the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford. While fighting with Pang De, he was driven into a valley full of thick vegetation and <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> was caught in some tree branches. He was killed by Pang De while attempting to free himself.|$|E
25|$|In early March 1976, Maeno flew around Kodama's {{neighborhood}} in Setagaya, gaining {{knowledge of the}} area in preparation for an attack. On the morning of March 23, 1976, Maeno arrived in the western suburbs of Tokyo at Chofu Airport with two friends. All three were dressed in the uniforms of kamikaze pilots, and Maeno informed airport officials that they were renting two planes for a kamikaze segment of a film. The flight was to prepare publicity for a planned film on the suicide bombers. Before 9:00a.m., the actor posed in his uniform, with white scarf, rising-sun images on <b>his</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and a headband {{in front of the}} Piper Cherokee plane he had rented.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} the play with the {{illusion}} of space in the painting {{can be seen in}} the young man at the top of the ladder holding the nails withdrawn from Christ's body. Campbell points out that this servant behind the cross appears to have caught <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> in the wooden tracery depicted at the top of the painting. The head of one of the bloody nails that he holds is in front of the fictional wooden picture frame, though the point of the other nail is behind the tracery. Campbell argues that, in order to prevent these spatial distortion from becoming too obvious, Rogier took pains to conceal the principal pictorial junctions in the picture. For example, the ladder is in an impossible perspective: its top is behind the cross while its foot appears to be in front of the cross. To conceal the points at which the Cross and the ladder meet the landscape, Rogier has greatly lengthened the Virgin's left leg, so that her left foot and mantle cover the base of the Cross and one upright of the ladder.|$|E
25|$|In December 1932 – January 1933, {{the actors}} were {{called back to}} film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections. Technical {{problems}} inherent in the process made filming difficult and time-consuming. Wray spent most of a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree to witness the battle between Kong and a Tyrannosaurus. She was sore for days after. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time. In December, Cooper re shot {{the scene of the}} female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re shot. The final scene was originally staged {{on the top of the}} Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and re shot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him.|$|E
25|$|While imprisoned, Hamilton Rowan met the Reverend William Jackson, an Irish-born Anglican clergyman who {{was working}} as a spy for the French Committee of Public Safety. Jackson's mission was to assess Ireland's {{readiness}} for revolution and French invasion. Jackson, Tone, and others met in Hamilton Rowan's Newgate cell to discuss the state of Ireland and the population's willingness to overthrow British rule. But Jackson was betrayed by a friend acting as a spy for the British Government, {{was arrested and charged with}} high treason. Immediately following Jackson's arrest, Hamilton Rowan fled to escape being tried for high treason. He convinced his jailer to allow him to visit his wife on the pretense of signing legal documents. While the jailer sat in the dining room of their home in Dublin, Hamilton Rowan excused himself to the bedroom, where he climbed down a rope made of knotted bed sheets to a waiting horse. Unwilling to be taken alive, he kept a razor blade in <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> and fled south to the coast. There he hired a boat to sail to France, and upon his arrival he was immediately arrested as a British spy. While in prison he was interrogated by Robespierre, who found him innocent of the charges raised against him and had Hamilton Rowan freed.|$|E

500|$|In <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> {{notes for}} the 1975 release of The Basement Tapes, Greil Marcus wrote, [...] "What {{was taking place}} as Dylan and The Band fiddled with the tunes, was less a style than a spirit—a spirit {{that had to do}} with a delight in {{friendship}} and invention." [...] He compared the songs to fabled works of American music: [...] "The Basement Tapes are a testing and a discovery of roots and memory ... they are no more likely to fade than Elvis Presley's 'Mystery Train' or Robert Johnson's 'Love In Vain." ...|$|E
500|$|The boxing {{scene was}} {{intended}} to differentiate the relationship between Q and Sisko from that of Q and Picard. [...] "Picard is an explorer, and in some ways, very much an intellectual. Sisko is a builder, {{a different kind of}} guy. He wears his heart a little more on <b>his</b> <b>sleeve,</b> and he acts on emotion, on instinct, more than Picard", Wolfe explained. John de Lancie offered a similar opinion: [...] "Q's relationship with Picard has always been a battle of wits, but I come into Deep Space Nine, and Sisko just bopped me on the nose! From a character point of view, that's a very big difference." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] {{is among}} Dylan's most celebrated compositions. In <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991, John Bauldie writes {{that it was}} Pete Seeger who first {{identified}} the melody of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] as Dylan's adaptation of the old Negro spiritual [...] "No More Auction Block". According to Alan Lomax's The Folk Songs of North America, the song originated in Canada and was sung by former slaves who fled there after Britain abolished slavery in 1833. In 1978, Dylan acknowledged the source when he told journalist Marc Rowland: [...] "'Blowin' in the Wind' {{has always been a}} spiritual. I took it off a song called 'No More Auction Block'—that's a spiritual and 'Blowin' in the Wind' follows the same feeling." [...] Dylan's performance of [...] "No More Auction Block" [...] was recorded at the Gaslight Cafe in October 1962, and appeared on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991.|$|E
500|$|Actress Kate Flannery {{later said}} that the days of filming were {{extremely}} [...] "hot", and she became sick of hot dogs after eating {{many of them in}} the contest seen in the episode. Many cast members spit out the hot dogs after putting them in their mouths, an act that sometimes activated Ed Helms' gag reflex. The cast members found the sumo suits uncomfortable, both due to the hot weather and the inability to sit down. Actress Angela Kinsey previewed before the episode broadcast that she would [...] "forever look at John Krasinski differently, because he looked so hilarious to me" [...] wearing his sumo suit. For the scenes of Helms floating in the lake in his sumo suit, the actor wore a harness and a fishing line that snaked out through <b>his</b> <b>sleeve,</b> the purpose being to drag him farther out on the lake. A crew member pulled him in a row boat; the crew would film a take of the scene, and then would have to wait fifteen minutes to do it again.|$|E
500|$|... "Honesty" [...] is a piano ballad with {{synthesizer}} embellishments. It {{opens with}} [...] "sad and tender" [...] piano chords. According to Ken Bielen {{in his book}} The Words and Music of Billy Joel, Liberty DeVitto's drums and cymbal crashes, remind listeners that [...] "the track is a predecessor of the power ballads of the 1980s and 1990s". It talks about the inherent lack of honesty even in the closest of relationships. In the song Joel sings the lines [...] "Honesty is such a lonely word". Joel further sings about wearing his heart on <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> in [...] "Honesty". According to Chuck Klosterman of The New York Times, [...] " [...] implies {{that the only way}} you can tell that someone really cares about you is if they tell you you're bad." [...] "Leningrad" [...] (1989), a song from Joel's eleventh studio album Storm Front, has been compared to [...] "Honesty". According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, [...] "Honesty" [...] is a pop rock and classical rock song written in the key of B♭ major. The song is set in common time and performed in a slow tempo of 80 beats per minute. Joel vocals range from the note of Bb2 to Bb4.|$|E

500|$|The Corporate Vice-President of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business division, Peter Moore, {{announced}} at E3 2006 {{that the game}} would appear on Xbox 360, by rolling up <b>his</b> <b>sleeve</b> to reveal a Grand Theft Auto IV temporary tattoo. Rockstar Games initially appeared {{to be committed to}} the original 16 October 2007 release date; however, Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter suggested that Take-Two may choose to delay the release of the game in order to boost its financial results for 2008 and to avoid competing with the release of other highly anticipated titles, such as Halo 3. Rockstar responded by saying that Grand Theft Auto IV was still on track for release in [...] "late October". On 2 August 2007, Take-Two announced that Grand Theft Auto IV would miss its original release date of 16 October 2007 contrary to their previous statements, and would be delayed to their second fiscal quarter (February–April) of 2008. In a later conference call with investors, Take-Two's Strauss Zelnick attributed the delay to [...] "almost strictly technological problems ... not problems, but challenges." [...] It was later revealed that technical difficulties with the PlayStation 3 version of the game contributed to the delay, along with storage problems on the Xbox 360. On 24 January 2008, Take-Two announced that Grand Theft Auto IV would be released on 29 April 2008. As the release date approached, Rockstar Games and Take-Two marketed the game heavily through various forms, including television ads, Internet video, billboards, viral marketing, and a redesigned website. A special edition of the game was also released for both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. At a Take-Two shareholder meeting on 18 April 2008, Take-Two CEO Ben Feder announced that Grand Theft Auto IV had already [...] "gone gold" [...] and was [...] "in production and in trucks en route to retailers". The game was eventually released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles in Europe, North America, and Oceania on 29 April 2008, and in Japan on 30 October 2008. Overall, Grand Theft Auto IV took over 1000 people and more than {{three and a half years}} to complete, with a total cost estimated at approximately $100 million, making it, at the time, the most expensive video game ever developed.|$|E
2500|$|When Lu Ji was {{six years}} old, his father brought him to Jiujiang Commandery (九江郡) to visit Yuan Shu. Yuan Shu treated his guests to {{mandarin}} oranges.
