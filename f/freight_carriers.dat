5|$|As the 19th century progressed, the {{increasing}} need for large <b>freight</b> <b>carriers</b> led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues {{charged by the}} Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A solution was to build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which {{was at the time}} the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began.|$|E

25|$|Metra's {{operating}} arm, the Northeast Illinois Regional Commuter Railroad Corporation, {{was created}} as a separate rail subsidiary which operates seven Metra owned routes. Contracts were set up with the Union Pacific and BNSF railroads to operate four other Metra routes. While Metra owns all rolling stock and is responsible for most stations on those routes, the <b>freight</b> <b>carriers</b> use their own employees and control the right-of-way for those routes. In keeping with Metra's purpose to provide a single identity for commuter rail in the region, the freight operators provide service under the Metra name.|$|E
25|$|The plan British Eagle {{developed}} in early 1966 for its future fleet requirements aimed to have 25 {{aircraft in service}} {{by the end of}} the decade, envisaging the operation of 15 jet aircraft — including two widebodies — and 10 turboprop planes. The former were to comprise two Boeing 747 freighters, five 707-320Cs for the carriage of both passengers and cargo and eight BAC One-Elevens — the last three of which were to be Quick Change (QC) models that could either be used as passenger or <b>freight</b> <b>carriers.</b> The latter were to consist of 10 Britannias. The end of a number of Ministry of Defence contracts in 1966 saw the airline with surplus aircraft and two Britannias were sold to Air Spain.|$|E

50|$|Dimensional {{weight is}} a {{calculation}} of a theoretical {{weight of a}} package. This theoretical weight is {{the weight of the}} package at a minimum density chosen by the <b>freight</b> <b>carrier.</b> If the package is below this minimum density, then the actual weight is irrelevant as the <b>freight</b> <b>carrier</b> will charge for the volume of the package as if it were of the chosen density (what the package would weigh at the minimum density). Furthermore, the volume used to calculate the dimensional weight may not be absolutely representative of the true volume of the package. The <b>freight</b> <b>carrier</b> will measure the longest dimension {{in each of the three}} axis (X, Y, Z) and use these measurements to determine the package volume. If the package is a right-angled rectangular box (cuboid), then this will be equal to the true volume of the package. However, if the package is of any other shape, then the calculation of volume will be more than the true volume of the package.|$|R

2500|$|Then Opposition leader Daniel Andrews, some Geelong {{politicians}} {{as well as}} the G21 Geelong regional {{alliance and}} the Metropolitan Transport Forum, which represents 23 councils covering three million residents, [...] criticised the Government's decision to begin work on the eastern end of the project. Andrews said the Government had ignored congestion problems in Melbourne's western suburbs and threatened Victoria's economic growth with commuters and <b>freight</b> <b>carriers</b> losing time in traffic. He said Victorian Labor [...] "could not support the tunnel" [...] and said Labor would release a detailed transport alternative before the end of 2013. Labor Party federal member for Corio Richard Marles said the greatest need was for an alternative to CityLink as an entry to Melbourne and state Labor MP for Bellarine Lisa Neville said the decision to start from the east was disastrous for the Geelong region. The Metropolitan Transport Forum said it had written to Transport Minister Terry Mulder urging the Government to reconsider its priorities and start the project at is western end make an earlier start on the Melbourne Metro Rail Project tunnel because it would take more trucks off suburban streets, improve public transport and support the growth of the Port of Melbourne.|$|E

5000|$|Shipping {{factors for}} {{imperial}} measurements represent cubic inches per pound (in3/lb) while metric factors represent cubic centimeters per kilogram (cm3/kg). These are the inverse {{of the package}} density. Dimensional weight is applied when the actual product density {{is less than the}} minimum density represented by the chosen factor. Dimensional weight is representative of the weight of the package at the minimum density accepted by the <b>freight</b> <b>carrier.</b> Shipping factors are not only different for imperial and metric measurements, but also for shipment mode and in some cases between different customers.
