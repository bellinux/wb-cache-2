He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle.

Everybody's looking at each other like, Is the tour gonna happen?" [...] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled, [...] "He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up.... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible.... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions". Wilkinson recounted that a few nights later in Detroit, [...] "I watched him in his dressing room, just draped over a chair, unable to move.
