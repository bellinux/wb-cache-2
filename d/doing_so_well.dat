25|$|Despite the {{barriers}} {{that come from}} being born to immigrants who are generally low skilled, have little education, and have less knowledge of the English language compared to U.S. natives, second-generation immigrants are doing better than U.S. native groups of comparable racial backgrounds, contradicting the concept of downward assimilation. A major factor that contributes to second-generation immigrants <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> is the drive to succeed and do better than their predecessors that is commonly instilled in these immigrants from childhood by their families. The theory of segment assimilation undermines such early socialization.|$|E
25|$|Around May 1834, the Melvilles {{moved to}} another house in Albany, a three-story brick house. That same month a fire {{destroyed}} Gansevoort's skin-preparing factory, which left him with personnel he could neither employ nor afford. Instead he pulled Melville {{out of the bank}} to man the cap and fur store. (Biographer Andrew Delbanco says that Gansevoort was <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> he could hire his younger brother until a fire broke out in 1835, destroying both factory and the store.) In any case, older brother Gansevoort served as a role model for Melville in various ways. In early 1834 Gansevoort had {{become a member of the}} Albany's Young Men's Association for Mutual Improvement, and in January 1835 Melville became a member as well.|$|E
25|$|Torishima {{is a fan}} {{of video}} games and was {{therefore}} put in charge of the first video game-related articles in Weekly Shōnen Jump, for which he brought in Yuji Horii to help. When his manager told him to figure out why CoroCoro Comic was <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>well,</b> Torishima determined {{it was because of the}} sealed pages that had to be cut opened and included cheats and tips for video games. In addition to including similar pages in Jump, they also began to rate games, something new at the time, with the resulting content being voted third in the magazine's reader polls. This was the birth of , the video game section of Weekly Shōnen Jump issues. After finding success with video game articles and wanting to show readers of Jump how one is developed, the magazine decided to develop their own role-playing game like Ultima so that they would have exclusive coverage of it. He decided to have Horii, who had begun working at Enix, write the scenario and Toriyama design the characters. Torishima claimed that he purposefully had Enix fully fund the game, intentionally keeping Shueisha out of the decision making process for the good of the product while still reserving the option to create a manga based on it and not pay any royalties. The video game was Dragon Quest.|$|E

However, in April 2005, Diarra revealed that he wanted to stay with Lens for the long-term.

2500|$|Bouck {{was born}} in St. Louis, Missouri, the second child of Lyle Joseph and Magdalen M. Bouck. His father, a [...] Private First Class in the U.S. Army during World War I, was a {{carpenter}} and Bouck grew up during the Depression and moved frequently with his family. With four siblings, (Robert, Bernice, Eugene and John) they often lived in homes with only one bedroom and no indoor plumbing or electricity. Bouck enlisted in the National Guard at age 14 so he could earn one dollar per drill day to help his family. He was never asked his age. He was rapidly promoted to Supply Sergeant at age 16, making more than most of his civilian friends. [...] At the outset of World War II, when his unit was sent to Alaska, he opted to choose another direction. He volunteered for the paratroop school, Officer Candidate School, or a third option. Officer Candidate School responded first, and Bouck graduated {{at the top of}} his class at Fort Benning, <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> that he was kept on as an instructor.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do.

[...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He or she might be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>well</b> he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E

2500|$|After Richie's death, Fusion is at {{a height}} of excellence. During this time, Babe and Amanda, who have renewed their friendship, develop a [...] "secret project" [...] which they think Kendall and Greenlee will approve, since Fusion is <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> <b>well.</b> The project {{turns out to be}} a {{fragrance}} designed for working women. Kendall refuses to support it, but Amanda offers to use part of her fortune to finance the fragrance. Kendall insults Babe for the working girl perfume being modeled after her, and this is when Amanda decides to call the perfume [...] "Bella." [...] Kendall and Greenlee let Amanda and Babe do the project on their own, and the perfume has high buzz. Amanda and Babe get into a little argument about which woman should be the promotional figure for Bella, in which Babe and Amanda want themselves on it. They ask Kendall, who could not care less, who then chooses Amanda. Amanda takes it as a compliment before Kendall says how the [...] "slutty" [...] look should appeal. Amanda organizes a launch party which goes well, except for Taylor Thompson killing Randi Morgan's pimp in the bathroom hallway. Things are working wonderfully, and JR and Babe decide to use Bella to launch her career, and they decide they should take over the company. They also begin to plan their next wedding and decide to have a second child. However, Adam has a plan of his own with the assistance of Pete Cortlandt who taints the Bella perfume at the launch party. Colby gets sick, but no one notices that it is due to the perfume. Greenlee later gets sick, but calls it the flu. When a wedding party arrives at P.V. Hospital, Angie Hubbard says that it is a toxin in Bella that is causing the sickness. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration then shuts Fusion Cosmetics temporarily down. While Adam is encouraging lawsuits against Fusion, Babe resigns and tells the company to blame the Bella scandal on her. She also admits that she and JR were planning to take over. She had an ulterior motive, as she and JR are planning to move to San Diego anyway. However, they have to come back when Adam has the subpoenaed to the Bella trial. JR and Babe do not make it to the trial, as they are caught up in a series of tornadoes that strike Pine Valley. Babe sacrifices herself to keep Little Adam from dying, making her internal and external bleeding worse. While in the hospital, she asks JR to marry her. They cannot find a minister as Babe is running out of time before she loses her life, but they exchange vows, regardless, alone in the hospital's chapel. They kiss and declare that they made each other better people and that they love each other from the deepest parts of their souls; that their love will never stop, no matter what. After a light hug, Babe dies in JR's arms.|$|E
