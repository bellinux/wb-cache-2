5|$|Septs are <b>family</b> <b>names</b> {{associated}} with a particular clan. In the case of MacIntyre, the surname Wright, when of Scottish origin, is considered an anglicized form of the name. Other <b>family</b> <b>names</b> {{associated with}} the clan include Glenoe, MacCoiseam, Tyrie (also Tyree) and MacTear.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{was named}} by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1905, {{along with the}} family Tyrannosauridae. The name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek words τυραννος/tyrannos ('tyrant') and σαυρος/sauros ('lizard'). The very common suffix -idae is {{normally}} appended to zoological <b>family</b> <b>names</b> and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E
5|$|A {{very small}} number of Muslims managed to escape to France and from there to the Muslim North Africa. Some revolted against this orderfor example, a revolt broke out in the Serra d'Espadà. The crown's troops {{defeated}} this rebellion in a campaign which included the killing of 5,000 Muslims. After the defeat of the rebellions, the entire Crown of Aragon was now nominally converted to Christianity. Mosques were demolished, first names and <b>family</b> <b>names</b> were changed, and the religious practice of Islam was driven underground.|$|E
2500|$|After Liang Ji's death, Emperor Huan made Liang Mengnü empress. However, {{he disliked}} her <b>family</b> <b>name</b> and {{therefore}} {{ordered her to}} take the <b>family</b> <b>name</b> Bo (薄). [...] He later found out that her original <b>family</b> <b>name</b> was actually Deng, and therefore had her <b>family</b> <b>name</b> restored.|$|R
50|$|Björn J:son Lindh's {{ancestors}} <b>family</b> <b>name</b> was Jansson {{for several}} generations. His father changed the <b>family</b> <b>name</b> to Lindh in 1931. The name combination J:son Lindh, where J:son originates from the <b>family</b> <b>name</b> Jansson, {{has been used}} since then, but was only in 2009 approved by The Swedish Patent and Registration Office as a <b>family</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As royalty and its {{privileges}} {{have been}} abolished in Germany, the Name [...] "Graf Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden" [...] is one complex <b>family</b> <b>name</b> only {{and not a}} <b>family</b> <b>name</b> and a title. The part of [...] "Graf" [...] in this <b>family</b> <b>name</b> is {{only a part of}} this <b>family</b> <b>name</b> and not a legally valid title.|$|R
5|$|Culture: Although {{there are}} many {{differences}} between Eastern and Western cultures, including as to how often <b>family</b> <b>names</b> or initials are used, the effect seems to apply across cultures. In their study with subjects from Thailand, where the family name is rarely used, Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun found a much stronger effect for first name than family name. Kitayama and Karasawa found no special effect for initials in Japan, where name initials are rarely used, but did find an overall name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian {{psychologist}} Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter {{effect has}} been replicated {{in dozens of}} studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for initials, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and <b>family</b> <b>names</b> still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} visible Hispanic {{legacies}} is the prevalence of Spanish names and surnames among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname, however, does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came {{as a result of}} a colonial edict by Governor-General Narciso Clavería y Zaldua, which ordered the systematic distribution of <b>family</b> <b>names</b> and implementation of Hispanic nomenclature on the population.|$|E
25|$|Personal name: The {{given name}} can precede a <b>family</b> <b>name</b> (as in some European cultures), {{or it can}} come after the <b>family</b> <b>name</b> (as in some East Asian cultures), or be used without a <b>family</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R

In casual conversation, people may omit middle names.Sometimes honorifics are {{used with the}} <b>family</b> <b>name.</b> However, the <b>family</b> <b>name</b> may be dropped {{completely}} as well. Some honorifics are Chaudhuri, Deraiya, Khondokar, Mir, and more.Many Muslims use Mohammad with their names.|$|R
5|$|Paleontologists Jose Bonaparte and Fernando Novas {{coined the}} name Abelisauridae in 1985 when they {{described}} the eponymous Abelisaurus. The name is formed {{from the family}} name of Roberto Abel, who discovered Abelisaurus, {{as well as from}} the Greek word σαυρος/sauros meaning 'lizard'. The very common suffix -idae is usually applied to zoological <b>family</b> <b>names</b> and is derived from the Greek suffix -ιδαι/-idai, which indicates a plural noun.|$|E
5|$|Romblon was {{separated}} from the jurisdiction of Arevalo and annexed to Capiz, when the province was created in 1716. More than a century later in 1850, {{the inhabitants of the}} province began using Spanish <b>family</b> <b>names</b> after governor-general Narciso Clavería decreed on 21 November 1849 the use of surnames from the Catálogo alfabético de apellidos. Asi-speaking natives were assigned the letter F, Romblomanon speakers were assigned the letter M, speakers of the Sibuyanon style of Romblomanon were assigned the letter R, while Onhan-speaking natives were assigned the letter G.|$|E
5|$|Systematic {{interest}} in the letter preference began in 1959 with brand-preference studies by researchers Mecherikoff and Horton. These tried to find the relative appeal of letters for use in package labels. In {{an extension of the}} studies, subjects were asked to rank the English alphabet by the pleasantness of the appearance of capital letters. While there was not a great deal of agreement amongst the subjects (the coefficients of concordance were low), a strong positive correlation was found between a letter's average rank and how frequently it occurred as an initial letter of <b>family</b> <b>names.</b>|$|E

50|$|Middle names provide {{additional}} information. Middle names may be inherited, follow naming customs, or {{be treated as}} part of the <b>family</b> <b>name.</b> For instance, in some Latin cultures, both the mother's <b>family</b> <b>name</b> and the father's <b>family</b> <b>name</b> are used by the children.|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of the inhabitants today are Muslim, but there are small Christian and Samaritan communities as well. Much of the local Palestinian Muslim population of Nablus {{is believed to be}} descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Certain Nabulsi <b>family</b> <b>names</b> are associated with Samaritan ancestry – Muslimani, Yaish, and Shakshir among others. According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it.|$|E
5|$|Across {{languages}} and letters, the average {{probability of a}} letter being chosen {{as one of the}} six preferred letters was 0.30 for name letters and 0.20 for other letters. The strongest effects were observed in the Norwegian and Finnish studies. In the Hungarian, Portuguese, and Italian studies the effect was present but not to a significant degree. The effect was also found when only looking at letters in <b>family</b> <b>names,</b> as well as only first name letters. The name-letter effect emerged as very significant in all languages when only initials were considered. There was a probability of 0.46 that initial letters were chosen amongst the top-six letters. Further analysis revealed that the overall name-letter effect is not simply due to initials: when excluding initials a name-letter effect was still found across all languages.|$|E
5|$|Jersey {{was part}} of Neustria with the same Gallo-Frankish {{population}} as the continental mainland. Jersey, the whole Channel Islands and the Cotentin peninsula (probably with the Avranchin) came formerly {{under the control of}} the duke of Brittany during the Viking invasions, because the king of the Franks was unable to defend them, however they remained in the archbishopric of Rouen. Jersey was invaded by Vikings in the 9th century. In 933 it was annexed to the future Duchy of Normandy, together with the other Channel Islands, Cotentin and Avranchin, by William Longsword, count of Rouen and it became one of the Norman Islands. When William's descendant, William the Conqueror, conquered England in 1066, the Duchy of Normandy and the kingdom of England were governed under one monarch. The Dukes of Normandy owned considerable estates in the island, and Norman families living on their estates established many of the historical Norman-French Jersey <b>family</b> <b>names.</b> King John lost all his territories in mainland Normandy in 1204 to King Philip II Augustus, but retained possession of Jersey and the other Channel Islands.|$|E
5000|$|As a <b>family</b> <b>name,</b> Sang may {{be written}} {{with only one}} hanja, meaning [...] "yet" [...] or [...] "still" [...] This <b>family</b> <b>name</b> has one bon-gwan: Mokcheon-eup (목천읍), Cheonan, Chungcheongnam-do. The 2000 South Korean census found 2,298 people with this <b>family</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nowadays, Manchus {{primarily}} use Chinese <b>family</b> {{and given}} <b>names,</b> but some still use a Manchu <b>family</b> <b>name</b> and Chinese given <b>name,</b> a Chinese <b>family</b> <b>name</b> and Manchu given name or both Manchu <b>family</b> and given <b>names.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{family had}} reached a {{significant}} position within their community: Ștefan sin Petre had made a steady income from his itinerant trade in wool, while his wife was the descendant of the Creangăs of Pipirig, a family of community leaders. The latter's members included Moldavian Metropolitan Iacob Stamati, as well as Smaranda's father, Vornic David, and her uncle Ciubuc Clopotarul, a monk at Neamț Monastery. Proud of this tradition, it was her who insisted for her son {{to pursue a career}} in the Church. According to his own recollection, the future writer was born on March 1, 1837—a date which has since been challenged. Creangă's other statements mention March 2, 1837, or an unknown date in 1836. The exactitude of other accounts is equally unreliable: community registers from the period gave the date of June 10, 1839, and mention another child of the same name being born to his parents on February 4, 1842 (the more probable birth date of Creangă's younger brother Zahei). The imprecision also touches other aspects of his family life: noting the resulting conflicts in data, Călinescu decided that it was not possible for one to know if the writer's parents were married to each other (and, if so, if they were on their first marriage), nor how many children they had together. At a time when <b>family</b> <b>names</b> were not legally required, and people were primarily known by various nicknames and patronymics, the boy was known to the community as Nică, a hypocorism formed from Ion, or more formally as Nică al lui Ștefan a Petrei ("Nică of Ștefan of Petru", occasionally Nic-a lui Ștefan a Petrei).|$|E
25|$|The Basque-speaking territories (the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre) usually follow Spanish naming customs (given names + two <b>family</b> <b>names,</b> the two <b>family</b> <b>names</b> being {{usually the}} father's and the mother's).|$|E
25|$|In general <b>family</b> <b>names</b> in all {{of these}} {{countries}} follow this pattern with some <b>family</b> <b>names</b> being typically Serbian, some typically Croat and yet others being common throughout the whole linguistic region.|$|E
50|$|In 939, Xu Zhigao {{changed his}} <b>family</b> <b>name</b> {{back from his}} adoptive <b>family</b> <b>name</b> of Xu to his {{original}} <b>family</b> <b>name</b> of Li and also took on a new personal name of Bian. A controversy thereafter evolved whether Xu Jingda, whose name was also then changed to Li Jingda, then the Prince of Xin, could remain married to Li Decheng's daughter, as Chinese traditions against endogamy prohibited the marriage between persons of the same <b>family</b> <b>name.</b> Li Bian issued an edict stating that due to the great accomplishments of Li Decheng, the marriage should remain intact; rather, he ordered that the Princess of Xin use Nanping as her <b>family</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>family</b> <b>name</b> is also {{rendered}} variously: Eszterházy (Hungarian spelling), Esterházy (German), and Esterhazy (typographic convenience). The full <b>family</b> <b>name</b> {{since the}} 16th century was Eszterházy de Galántha (later also styled von/of Galanta). The Latinised {{form of the}} <b>family</b> <b>name,</b> Estoras, in 2009 is used to label fine Esterházy wines.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2008, the South Korean family {{register}} (hoju) was changed. As a result, children could use their maternal <b>family</b> <b>name</b> when the <b>family</b> members wanted it.

25|$|To {{this day}} many Icelanders claim descent from Egil through their {{membership}} in the Myrar family, {{one of the few}} legally recognized <b>family</b> <b>names</b> in Iceland (the majority of Icelanders do not possess <b>family</b> <b>names</b> but use the patronymic).|$|E
25|$|Although given names {{appear before}} <b>family</b> <b>names</b> in most Romanian contexts, {{official}} documents invert the order, ostensibly for filing purposes.

25|$|The {{ratio of}} the number of <b>family</b> <b>names</b> to the {{population}} is high in France, {{due to the fact that}} most surnames had many orthographic and dialectal variants (more than 40 for some) which were registered as separate names around 1880 when “” were issued. According to the French Institute for Statistics INSEE, more than 1,300,000 surnames were registered in the country between 1891 and 1990, and about 200,000 disappeared meanwhile (mainly orthographic variants). It is believed that the number of <b>family</b> <b>names</b> at any time since 1990 hovers between 800,000 and 1,200,000. Not all <b>family</b> <b>names</b> are of French origin, as many families have some immigrant roots.|$|E
