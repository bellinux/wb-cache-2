5|$|Among her {{maternal}} ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Shields, a slave on Henry Walls Shields' 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia. Melvinia's first son, Dolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born <b>into</b> <b>slavery</b> about 1860. Based on DNA {{and other}} evidence, in 2012 researchers {{said his father}} was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of her master.

5|$|In a {{biography}} of Walter Francis White—African-American civil rights leader and N.A.A.C.P president—historian Kenneth Robert Janken notes that White's mother Madeline Harrison traced some of her mixed-race white ancestry to Harrison in Virginia. According to Janken, her family maintained that Dilsia, a female slave belonging to William Henry Harrison, had six children by him, born <b>into</b> <b>slavery.</b> Four {{were said to be}} sold to a planter in La Grange, Georgia, including a daughter, Marie Harrison. Marie was said to be Madeline's mother.|$|E
5|$|Lee gave strict {{orders for}} his army to {{minimize}} any negative {{impacts on the}} civilian population. Food, horses, and other supplies were generally not seized outright, although quartermasters reimbursing Northern farmers and merchants with Confederate money were not well received. Various towns, most notably York, Pennsylvania, were required to pay indemnities in lieu of supplies, under threat of destruction. During the invasion, the Confederates seized some 40 northern African Americans. A few of them were escaped fugitive slaves, but most were freemen; all were sent south <b>into</b> <b>slavery</b> under guard.|$|E

When Mansfield's nephew Captain Sir John Lindsay returned to Britain in 1765 following the Seven Years' War and his assignment in the West Indies, he brought his natural daughter Elizabeth. Of half African descent, she was born <b>into</b> <b>slavery</b> in 1761, the daughter of Maria Bell, an enslaved woman.

5|$|The British {{initially}} {{became involved}} in the slave trade during the 16th century. By 1783, the triangular route that took British-made goods to Africa to buy slaves, transported the enslaved to the West Indies, and then brought slave-grown products such as sugar, tobacco, and cotton to Britain, represented about 80percent of Great Britain's foreign income. British ships dominated the trade, supplying French, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese and British colonies, and in peak years carried forty thousand enslaved men, women and children across the Atlantic in the horrific conditions of the middle passage. Of the estimated 11million Africans transported <b>into</b> <b>slavery,</b> about 1.4million died during the voyage.|$|E
5|$|The seas around Gibraltar {{continued}} to be dangerous {{for decades to come}} as Barbary pirate raids continued; although a small squadron of Spanish galleys was based at the port to counter pirate raids, it proved to be of limited effectiveness and many inhabitants were abducted and sold <b>into</b> <b>slavery</b> by the pirates. The problem worsened significantly after 1606, when Spain expelled the Moriscos;– Muslims who had converted to Christianity. Many of the expellees were evacuated to North Africa via Gibraltar but ended up joining the pirate fleets, either as Christian slaves or reconverted Muslims, and raided as far afield as Cornwall.|$|E

Rainilaiarivony took 80 slaves, while his older brother took more than 160. However, the campaign was only partly successful in pacifying the region and the Merina hold over the outlying areas of the island remained tenuous throughout the 19th century.|$|E

5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Hohenstaufen authority Latin- and Greek-speaking Christians maintained their privileges, but the Muslim population was increasingly oppressed. The settlements of Italians brought from northern Italy (who wanted Muslim property for their own) led many Muslim communities to revolt or resettle in mountainous areas of Sicily. These revolts resulted in some acts of violence, and the eventual deportation of Muslims, which began under Frederick II. Eventually, the government removed the entire Muslim population to Lucera in Apulia and Girifalco in Calabria, where they paid taxes and served as agricultural laborers, craftsmen, and crossbowmen {{for the benefit of}} the king. The colony at Lucera was finally disbanded in 1300 under Charles II of Naples, and many of its inhabitants sold <b>into</b> <b>slavery.</b> The Jewish community was expelled after {{the establishment}} of the Spanish Inquisition from 1493 to 1513 in Sicily. The remaining Jews were gradually assimilated, and most of them converted to Roman Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Al-Muktafi {{also kept}} up the {{perennial}} conflict with the Byzantine Empire, with varying success. In May 902, al-Qasim ibn Sima al-Farghani was appointed {{in command of the}} frontier districts of the Jazira. In 902 or 903, a naval raid reached the island of Lemnos, dangerously close to the Byzantine capital, Constantinople; the island was plundered and its inhabitants carried off <b>into</b> <b>slavery.</b> Nevertheless, in May 903, the newly appointed governor of Tarsus, Abu'l-Asha'ir Ahmad ibn Nasr, was dispatched to the frontier districts with gifts for the Byzantine ruler, Leo VI the Wise (r. 886–912), and in return, Byzantine envoys arrived in Baghdad for negotiations on a prisoner exchange. The exchange eventually took place in September–October 905, at the river Lamus in Cilicia, but was interrupted because the Byzantines reneged on the agreed terms. After further negotiations, the exchange was completed in August 908.|$|E
5000|$|For similar moral panics around social {{tensions}} manifesting via {{discussion of}} drugs and sex crime, researchers point to the opium scare of the late 19th century, in which [...] "sinister Chinese" [...] were said to use opium to coerce white women <b>into</b> sexual <b>slavery.</b> Similarly, in the Progressive Era, a persistent urban legend told of white middle-class women being surreptitiously drugged, abducted and sold <b>into</b> sexual <b>slavery</b> to Latin American brothels. This analysis doesn't contradict instances when date rape drugs are used or sexual trafficking occurs; its focus is on actual prevalence of certain crimes relative to media coverage of it.|$|R
