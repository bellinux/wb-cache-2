5|$|<b>Emigration</b> {{patterns}} in the Nordic countriesFinland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Icelandshow striking variation. Nordic mass <b>emigration</b> started in Norway, which also retained the highest rate throughout the century. Sweden got underway in the early 1840s, and had the third-highest rate in all of Europe, after Ireland and Norway. Denmark had a consistently low rate of <b>emigration,</b> while Iceland had a late start but soon reached levels comparable to Norway. Finland, whose mass <b>emigration</b> did not start until the late 1880s, {{and at the time}} part of the Russian Empire, is usually classified as part of the Eastern European wave.|$|E
5|$|Corrupt {{politicians}} are {{already beginning to}} speculate on them as possible capital for their schemes and to fill their poor heads {{with all sorts of}} vagaries.

5|$|In 1938, Eichmann {{was posted}} to Vienna to help organise Jewish <b>emigration</b> from Austria, which {{had just been}} {{integrated}} into the Reich through the Anschluss. Jewish community organisations were placed under supervision of the SD and tasked with encouraging and facilitating Jewish <b>emigration.</b> Funding came from money seized from other Jewish people and organisations, as well as donations from overseas, which were placed under SD control. Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmführer (first lieutenant) in July 1938, and appointed to the Central Agency for Jewish <b>Emigration</b> in Vienna, created in August. By {{the time he left}} Vienna in May 1939, nearly 100,000 Jews had left Austria legally, and many more had been smuggled out to Palestine and elsewhere.|$|E

40|$|Hypotheses are {{presented}} {{to explain the}} juvenile migratory behavior of yearling chinook salmon and steelhead in the Yakima River over a thirteen-year period with particular reference to water movement. Interactions of <b>emigrations</b> with water movements, measured as daily flow, and daily change in flow, are pervasive, however annual variations in the annual timing of <b>emigrations</b> are not explained by timing of water movement. Even though annual <b>emigrations</b> of yearling chinook and juvenile steelhead can be tightly synchronized with water movements, under time patterns of water movement associated with impoundment and regulation, <b>emigrations</b> and water movements are not necessarily synchronous. An approach to statistical analysis using fish-weighted statistics is recommended in order to best capture the ambient physical conditions experienced by the average fish. Timing of <b>emigrations</b> of juvenile steelhead and yearling chinook overlap, but yearling chinook usually emigrate earlier (grand mean April 25) than juvenile steelhead (grand mean April 29). Yearling chinook and juvenile steelhead emigrate under all observed water movement conditions, however individuals of both species are virtually certain to emigrate when sharp positive changes in daily water volume occur during the migration season. Both yearling chinook and juvenile steelhead emigrants are positively associated with water accelerations. Yearling chinook and juvenile steelhead emigrants are predominantly positively associated with flow, and they are only occasionally negatively associated with flow. When annual average instantaneous Yakima River flow is below the long term average (102. 4 m 3 /s), the average Yakima River yearling chinook and juvenile steelhead emigrates within the highest water flows and accelerations available. These findings support theories of juvenile salmon migration advanced by Hoar, Groot, Thorpe, and Northcote...|$|R

5|$|By 1849, {{many of the}} Latter-day Saints who {{remained}} in Iowa or Missouri were poor and unable to afford {{the costs of the}} wagon, teams of oxen, and supplies that would be required for the trip. Therefore, the LDS Church established a revolving fund, known as the Perpetual <b>Emigration</b> Fund, to enable the poor to emigrate. By 1852, most of the Latter-day Saints from Nauvoo who wished to emigrate had done so, and the church abandoned its settlements in Iowa. However, many church members from the eastern states and from Europe continued to emigrate to Utah, often assisted by the Perpetual <b>Emigration</b> Fund.|$|E

5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. <b>Emigration</b> in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in abrupt waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant <b>emigration</b> of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later.
