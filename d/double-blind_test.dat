40|$|BACKGROUND: Individuals with {{idiopathic}} environmental illness with attribution to {{electromagnetic fields}} (IEI-EMF) believe they suffer negative health effects {{when exposed to}} electromagnetic fields from everyday objects such as mobile phone base stations. OBJECTIVES: This study used both open provocation and <b>double-blind</b> <b>tests</b> to determine if sensitive and control individuals experience more negative health effects when exposed to base station-like signals compared with sham. METHODS: Fifty-six self-reported sensitive and 120 control participants were tested in an open provocation test. Of these, 12 sensitive and 6 controls withdrew after the first session. The remainder completed a series of <b>double-blind</b> <b>tests.</b> Subjective measures of well-being and symptoms as well as physiological measures of blood volume pulse, heart rate, and skin conductance were obtained. RESULTS: During the open provocation, sensitive individuals reported lower levels of well-being in both the global system for mobile communication (GSM) and universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) compared with sham exposure, whereas controls reported more symptoms during the UMTS exposure. During <b>double-blind</b> <b>tests</b> the GSM signal {{did not have any}} effect on either group. Sensitive participants did report elevated levels of arousal during the UMTS condition, whereas the number or severity of symptoms experienced did not increase. Physiological measures did not differ across the three exposure conditions for either group. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to a typical GSM base station-like signal did not affect wellbeing or physiological functions in sensitive or control individuals. Sensitive individuals reported elevated levels of arousal when exposed to a UMTS signal. Further analysis, however, indicated that this difference was likely to be due to the effect of order of exposure rather than the exposure itself...|$|R

5000|$|The {{high cost}} of OEM ink {{cartridges}} and the intentional obstacles to refilling them have been addressed by the growth of third-party ink suppliers. Many printer manufacturers discourage customers from using third-party inks, stating that they can damage the print heads due to not being the same formulation as the OEM inks, cause leaks, and produce inferior-quality output (e.g. of incorrect color gamut). Consumer Reports has noted that some third-party cartridges may contain less ink than OEM cartridges, and thus yield no cost savings, while Wilhelm Imaging Research claims that with third-party inks the lifetime of prints may be considerably reduced. [...] However, an April 2007 review showed that, in a <b>double-blind</b> <b>test,</b> reviewers generally preferred the output produced using third-party ink over OEM ink. In general, OEM inks have undergone significant system reliability testing with the cartridge and print-head materials, whereas R&D efforts on third-party ink material compatibility {{are likely to be}} significantly less. Some inkjet manufacturers have tried to prevent cartridges being refilled using various schemes including fitting chips to the cartridges that log how much the cartridge has printed and prevent the operation of a refilled cartridge.|$|E
50|$|Listening {{tests are}} used by hi-fi manufacturers, audiophile {{magazines}} and audio engineering researchers and scientists. If a listening test is done {{in such a way}} that the listener who is assessing the sound quality of a component or recording can see the components that are being used for the test (e.g., the same musical piece listened to through a tube power amplifier and a solid state amplifier), then it is possible that the listener's pre-existing biases towards or against certain components or brands could affect their judgement. To respond to this issue, researchers began to use blind tests, in which the researchers can see the components being tested, but not the listeners undergoing the experiments. In a double-blind experiment, neither the listeners nor the researchers know who belongs to the control group and the experimental group, or which type of audio component is being used for which listening sample. Only after all the data has been recorded (and in some cases, analyzed) do the researchers learn which components or recordings were preferred by the listeners. A commonly used variant of this test is the ABX test. A subject is presented with two known samples (sample A, the reference, and sample B, an alternative), and one unknown sample X, for three samples total. X is randomly selected from A and B, and the subject identifies X as being either A or B. Although there is no way to prove that a certain methodology is transparent, a properly conducted <b>double-blind</b> <b>test</b> can prove that a method is not transparent.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{provocation}} {{experiments with}} persons reporting electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) have been criticised because EHS persons {{were obliged to}} travel to study locations (seen as stressful), {{and that they were}} unable to select the type of signal they reported reacting to. In our study we used mobile exposure units that allow double-blind exposure conditions with personalised exposure settings (signal type, strength, duration) at home. Our aim was to evaluate whether subjects were able to identify exposure conditions, and to assess if providing feedback on personal test results altered the level of self-reported EHS. METHODS: We used double-blind randomised controlled exposure testing with questionnaires at baseline, immediately before and after testing, and at two and four months post testing. Participants were eligible if they reported sensing either radiofrequency or extremely low frequency fields within minutes of exposure. Participants were visited at home or another location where they felt comfortable to undergo <b>testing.</b> Before <b>double-blind</b> <b>testing,</b> we verified together with participants in an unblinded exposure session that the exposure settings were selected were ones that the participant responded to. <b>Double-blind</b> <b>testing</b> consisted of a series of 10 exposure and sham exposures in random sequence, feedback on test results was provided directly after testing. RESULTS: 42 persons participated, mean age was 55 years (range 29 - 78), 76 % were women. During <b>double-blind</b> <b>testing,</b> no participant was able to correctly identify when they were being exposed better than chance. There were no statistically significant differences in the self-reported level of EHS at follow-up compared to baseline, but during follow-up participants reported reduced certainty in reacting within minutes to exposure and reported significantly fewer symptoms compared to baseline. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that a subgroup of persons exist who profit from participation in a personalised testing procedure...|$|R
