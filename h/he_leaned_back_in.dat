60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, {{filled with}} delight and amusement.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair}} as {{two or three}} of the senior day-room {{collected}} round the Sportsman.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair}} and {{regarded}} with intense satisfaction the horrified faces of the group in front.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, and I in mine, and {{the absurd}} parody of our {{attitude}} strikes us both.|$|R
60|$|Now {{and then}} {{he turns to the}} camp-bed, and wetting his towel in the basin, presses it against his brow. Now <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, as if to give up; but again bends over and plods.|$|R
6000|$|MR. RICHARDS, unsympathetically: [...] "Nothing of {{the kind}} has happened. This car has simply come uncoupled, {{and the rest of}} the train has gone on ahead, and left us {{standing}} on the track, nowhere <b>in</b> particular." [...] <b>He</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, and wheels it round from her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair}} and, {{twisting}} the paper-knife idly between his fingers, watched his chief clerk closely.|$|E
60|$|She whispered {{something}} in Macheson's ear which he affected not to hear. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his cushioned seat and laughed.|$|E
60|$|Lord Chelsford {{referred}} to some {{notes in his}} hand. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, {{and looked at me}} steadfastly.|$|E
60|$|Margaret {{saw that}} he was unusually agitated, and not by grief; applied herself to tea-making, and hoped his walk had given him an appetite; but there seemed little chance of this so long were his pauses between each morsel, and so often did <b>he</b> <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair.|$|R
60|$|Sir Leicester is {{generally}} in a complacent state, and rarely bored. When {{he has nothing}} else to do, he can always contemplate his own greatness. It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so inexhaustible a subject. After reading his letters, <b>he</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to society.|$|R
60|$|Dunstable, apparently, {{was worried}} by no scruples. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> easily <b>in</b> his chair, and {{kept up a}} bright flow of conversation.|$|R
60|$|He {{saw that}} she did not grasp all he meant to convey, and <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair with a laugh.|$|E
60|$|And, having handled a {{delicate}} matter in masterly fashion, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair and}} chewed the end off another cigar.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, {{one hand}} on the child's head, which he {{smoothed}} mechanically, and gesticulated with the other, speaking to Almayer.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> weakly <b>in</b> his desk. He had not died. God had spared him still. He {{was still}} in the {{familiar}} world of the school. Mr Tate and Vincent Heron stood at the window, talking, jesting, gazing out at the bleak rain, moving their heads.|$|R
6000|$|My last answer {{appeared}} to relieve him. <b>He</b> sighed, and <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair. [...] "That's right!" [...] {{he said to}} himself. [...] "I'm glad to hear that." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the evening}} {{he went to}} Dryholm and dined with Bernard at a small table in the spacious room. Afterwards they sat by the fire talking quietly. Flickering {{reflections}} played about the carved marble and bright steel; electric lights, half-hidden by the cornice, threw down a soft light, and Bernard looked old and worn as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> languidly <b>in</b> his big chair.|$|R
60|$|After {{glancing over}} it in a masterly way, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{his chair and}} {{bestowed}} upon me an explosion of sardonic, superior, collegiate laughter.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair. There was a pained {{look in his}} face. She {{was almost}} sorry that she had {{mentioned}} his daughter's name.|$|E
60|$|Robert Vynerâ€™s face {{hardened}} {{again for}} a moment. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair and, playing with his watch-chain, regarded the other intently. Then he smiled maliciously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Reggie, drowsily, [...] "there {{are several}} ways of bidding, you know. You can shout, or you can nod, or you can twiddle your fingers--" [...] The effort of {{concentration}} {{was too much for}} him. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> limply <b>in</b> his chair. [...] "I'll tell you what. I've nothing to do this afternoon. I'll come with you and show you." ...|$|R
60|$|The Major, as <b>he</b> said this, <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, put {{his hand}} up to his moustache, and looked sadly away into the vacancy of the room, {{as though he was}} meditating sorrowfully on the ingratitude of the world.|$|R
6000|$|However, {{this evening}} was an exception. Generally we talked of the West, of cattle ranching, of {{trailing}} {{and of the}} splendid types of pioneers who were about to vanish from the earth. One night as we sat at dinner in his house, <b>he</b> suddenly <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair and {{said with a smile}} [...] "I can't tell you how I enjoy having a man at my table who knows the difference between a parfleche and an aparejo." ...|$|R
60|$|They {{sat on his}} {{left-hand}} side, Phineas Duge {{pushed the}} decanter of Burgundy toward them, and the cigars. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair and waited.|$|E
60|$|Captain Griffiths {{appeared}} {{to receive the}} news with a certain undemonstrative satisfaction. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair with the air of one who is content to wait.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his padded chair, {{his hands}} folded {{in front of}} him, his cigar {{in the corner of}} his mouth. Arnold {{smoothed}} the paper out and read: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{know a few}} {{secrets of}} nature in our profession, sir,' said the doctor. 'Of course we do. We study for that; we pass the Hall and the College for that; and we take our station in society BY that. It's {{extraordinary}} how little is known on these subjects generally. Where do you suppose, now'--the doctor closed one eye, as <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> smilingly <b>in</b> his chair, and formed a triangle with his hands, of which his two thumbs composed the base--'where do you suppose Mr Crimple's stomach is?' ...|$|R
60|$|The two charges {{left in the}} gun {{were all}} that stood between him and eternity. With a desperate display of {{strength}} Jones threw his weight in a backward pull, and hauled Kentuck up. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> far <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the saddle, and shoved the Colts out beyond the horse's flank. Down went the broad head, with its black, glistening horns. Bang! She slid forward with a crash, plowing the ground with hoofs and nose--spouted blood, uttered a hoarse cry, kicked and died.|$|R
60|$|In the afternoon, when <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back,</b> half asleep, <b>in</b> his corner, {{the trooper}} came in again. Deering did not move, {{but his eyes}} were not {{altogether}} shut and he saw the fellow's glance was keen and fixed. In a moment or two the trooper turned his head, and going into the vestibule, did not shut the door quietly. Deering's curiosity was satisfied; the police knew he was on board.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, {{surveying}} Billy blandly {{through his}} eye-glass. Billy's eyes were goggling. He looked from Psmith {{to the paper}} and from the paper to Psmith.|$|E
60|$|The letter which Mr. Ravenor {{had been}} writing {{to my mother}} was {{finished}} and sealed at last. Then <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair and looked steadily at me.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Gaynsforth, {{although}} he was an Englishman and young, showed himself to be possessed {{of a sense of}} humor. <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his seat and roared with laughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said he, [...] "I am not crazy. I {{expected}} you {{to think}} that, and am entirely prepared for your look of amazement and incipient horror. I will ask you, however, to set aside for a time the dictates of your own sense, and hear what I have to say. Then {{you can take the}} whole matter into consideration, and draw your own conclusions." [...] <b>He</b> now <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, and went on with his story: [...] "It would be more correct, perhaps, for me to say that I was the Vizier of the Two-horned Alexander, for that great personage died long ago. Now, I don't believe you ever heard anything about the Two-horned Alexander." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Treffry took {{a lengthy}} draught. [...] "Broken my promise; don't matter--won't hurt any one but me." [...] He {{took up the}} pipe and pressed tobacco into it. [...] "I've been lying here with this pain going right through me, and never a smoke! D'you tell me {{anything}} the parsons say can do me half the good of this pipe?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back,</b> steeped <b>in</b> a luxury of satisfaction. He went on, pursuing a private train of thought: [...] "Things have changed a lot since my young days. When I was a youngster, a young fellow had {{to look out for}} peck and perch--he put the future in his pocket. He did well or not, according as he had stuff in him. Now he's not content with that, it seems--trades on his own opinion of himself; thinks he is what he says he's going to be." ...|$|R
6000|$|When Ernest {{reached his}} brother's house, he went {{at once to}} Harold's bedside, and without a word of {{introduction}} or recognition he began inquiring {{into the nature of}} his symptoms, exactly as he would have done with any unknown and ordinary patient. Harold told him them all, simply and straightforwardly, without any more preface than he would have used with any other doctor. When Ernest had finished his diagnosis, <b>he</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> carelessly <b>in</b> his easy chair, folded his arms sternly, and said in a perfectly cold, clear, remorseless voice, [...] "Ah, I thought so; yes, yes, I thought so. It's a serious functional disorder of the heart; and there's very little hope indeed that you'll ever recover from it. No hope at all, I may say; no hope at all, I'm certain. The thing has been creeping upon you, creeping upon you, evidently, for a year past, and it has gone too far now to leave the faintest hope of ultimate recovery." ...|$|R
