5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot <b>gas</b> <b>stream.</b> Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to disturb the flame and their temperature remains close {{to that of the}} local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.|$|E

Of course, most large plants perform both functions, and plants have no other ultimate purpose than to quickly, safely and profitably turn raw gas into products to be safely shipped (mostly by pipeline) to market.

The syngas produced by the gasifiers needs to be treated through various processes {{for the removal of}} impurities already in the <b>gas</b> <b>stream,</b> so all that is required to remove CO2 is to add the necessary equipment, an absorber and regenerator, to this process train. In combustion applications, modifications must be done to the exhaust stack and because of the lower concentrations of CO2 present in the exhaust, much larger volumes of total gas require processing, necessitating larger and more expensive equipment.|$|E

Supporting this hypothesis, G1, a cloud that passed near the black hole 13 years ago, had an orbit almost identical to G2, consistent with both clouds, and a gas tail thought to be trailing G2, all being denser clumps within a large single <b>gas</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cremation {{of bodies}} {{containing}} amalgam restorations results in near-complete emission of the mercury into the atmosphere, {{as the temperature}} in cremation is far greater than the boiling point of mercury. In countries with high cremation rates (such as the UK), mercury has become a great concern. Proposals to remedy the situation have ranged from removing amalgam-containing teeth prior to cremation to installing activated carbon adsorption or other post-combustion mercury capture technology in the flue <b>gas</b> <b>stream.</b> According to the United Nations Environment Programme, {{it is estimated that}} globally about 3.6 tonnes of mercury vapor was emitted into the air through cremation in 2010, or about 1% of total global emissions. Mercury emissions from cremation are growing in the US, both because cremation rates are increasing and because the number of teeth in the deceased are increasing due to better dental care. Since amalgam restorations are very durable and relatively inexpensive, many of the older deceased have amalgam restorations. According to work done in Great Britain, mercury emissions from cremation are expected to increase until at least 2020.|$|E

500|$|The other primary {{method of}} {{producing}} [...] is passing {{a stream of}} clean, dry air through one bed {{of a pair of}} identical zeolite molecular sieves, which absorbs the nitrogen and delivers a <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> that is 90%to93% [...] Simultaneously, nitrogen gas is released from the other nitrogen-saturated zeolite bed, by reducing the chamber operating pressure and diverting part of the oxygen gas from the producer bed through it, in the reverse direction of flow. After a set cycle time the operation of the two beds is interchanged, thereby allowing for a continuous supply of gaseous oxygen to be pumped through a pipeline. This is known as pressure swing adsorption. Oxygen gas is increasingly obtained by these non-cryogenic technologies (see also the related vacuum swing adsorption).|$|E

MOF materials are adsorption-based, and thus can be tuned to achieve selectivity. The drawback to MOF systems is stability in water and other compounds present in flue <b>gas</b> <b>streams.</b> Select materials, such as ZIF-8, have demonstrated stability in water and benzene, contents often present in flue gas mixtures. ZIF-8 can be synthesized as a membrane on a porous alumina support and {{has proven to be}} effective at separating CO2 from flue <b>gas</b> <b>streams.</b> At similar CO2/CH4 selectivity to Y-type zeolite membranes, ZIF-8 membranes achieve unprecedented CO2 permeance, two orders of magnitude above the previous standard.|$|R

2500|$|In {{oxy-fuel}} combustion the fuel is burned in oxygen instead of air. To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and {{injected into the}} combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored. Power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "zero emission" [...] cycles, because the [...] stored is not a fraction removed from the flue <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> (as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture) but the flue <b>gas</b> <b>stream</b> itself.
