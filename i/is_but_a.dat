5|$|On February 16, 2013, Beyoncé {{released}} Life <b>Is</b> <b>But</b> <b>a</b> Dream, an autobiographical television film. Released on the HBO channel, it garnered 1.8 {{million viewers}} {{for the initial}} broadcast, becoming the largest audience for a documentary since Nielsen Media Research revised its method of measuring viewership in 2004. However, critical commentary towards Life <b>Is</b> <b>But</b> <b>a</b> Dream was mixed with divided opinions by critics.|$|E

There <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> single tree– a 2-metre high poplar on a cliff overlooking Mingulay Bay. Sea holly, otherwise rare in the Western Isles, has grown on Mingulay since at least the late nineteenth century, and sea milkwort, normally only found at sea level is able to grow on the high cliff tops due to the ocean spray and seagull manure. In spring and summer there are profusions of wild flowers around the deserted Village.|$|E

25|$|Such is {{the system}} in outline. The {{historical}} position of the system lies in its relations to Kant, Schelling and Hegel. Cousin was opposed to Kant in asserting that the unconditioned {{in the form of}} infinite or absolute cause <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> mere unrealizable tentative or {{effort on the part of}} and something different from a mere negation, yet not equivalent to a positive thought. With Cousin the absolute as the ground of being is grasped positively by the intelligence, and it renders all else intelligible; it is not as with Kant a certain hypothetical or regulative need.|$|E
25|$|Life <b>Is</b> <b>But</b> <b>a</b> Dream is a 2013 autobiographical {{television}} film, {{directed and}} executive produced by American singer Beyoncé Knowles. The film {{was released on}} February 16, 2013 on the HBO network, in conjunction with Parkwood Entertainment, Knowles' management company.

Upon its release, the documentary opened to mixed reviews from critics. It is nominated in the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Documentary category for the 45th Annual NAACP Image Awards. It is Knowles' 6th nomination.|$|E
25|$|Rachmaninoff {{had great}} command of {{counterpoint}} and fugal writing, {{thanks to his}} studies with Taneyev. The above-mentioned occurrence of the Dies Irae in the Second Symphony (1907) <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> small example of this. Very characteristic of his writing is chromatic counterpoint. This talent was paired with a confidence in writing in both large- and small-scale forms. The Third Piano Concerto especially shows a structural ingenuity, while each of the preludes grows from a tiny melodic or rhythmic fragment into a taut, powerfully evocative miniature, crystallizing a particular mood or sentiment while employing a complexity of texture, rhythmic flexibility and a pungent chromatic harmony.|$|E

25|$|The {{global system}} of indentured laborers was {{abolished}} in 1918, although in Mauritius, the Immigration Depot still continued operating until 1923. By then, the Great Experiment {{had seen the}} transportation of an estimated two million people throughout the world, with Mauritius welcoming the largest contingent of indentured laborers, reaching {{nearly half a million}} Indian immigrants. In total, 1.2 million Indian migrants were handled by emigration depots worldwide, becoming the global working class of the British Empire. On a larger picture, the migration of indentured laborers <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> small portion of the Indian diaspora, which has continued through the 20th century to contemporary times. It is estimated that up to 20 million Indians have emigrated from their homeland, making it the largest diaspora in modern times.|$|E
25|$|Relieved Davis and {{appointed}} D. D. Porter to the Western Flotilla, which is hereafter {{to be recognized}} as a squadron. Porter <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> Commander. He has, however, stirring and positive qualities, is fertile in resources, has great energy, excessive and sometimes not over-scrupulous ambition, is impressed with and boastful of his own powers, given to exaggeration in relation to himself, a Porter infirmity, is not generous to older and superior living officers, whom he is too ready to traduce, but is kind and patronizing to favorites who are juniors, and generally to official inferiors. Is given to cliquism but is brave and daring like all his family... It is a question, with his mixture of good and bad traits, how he will succeed.|$|E
25|$|The {{time and}} {{circumstances}} of its final extinction are wholly unknown, but {{the site is}} now desolate, and the whole neighbouring district, once celebrated {{as one of the}} most fertile in Italy, was by the mid-19th century almost wholly uninhabited. The position of the ancient city may nevertheless be clearly identified; and though no ruins worthy of the name are still extant, large heaps of rubbish and foundations of ancient buildings mark the site of Heraclea near Policoro, about 5km from the sea, and a short distance from the right bank of the Aciris. Numerous coins, bronzes, and other relics of antiquity have been discovered on the spot. A medieval town, Anglona, was founded on the site; however, once a bishopric, now itself <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> heap of ruins, among which are those of an 11th-century church.|$|E

25|$|The bridge {{question}} has again been revived {{after many years}} of slumber, and business men in Quebec seem hopeful that something will come of it, though the placing of a subsidy on the statute book <b>is</b> <b>but</b> <b>a</b> small part of the work to be accomplished, as some of its enthusiastic promoters will, ere long, discover. Both Federal and Provincial Governments seem disposed to contribute towards the cost, and the City of Quebec will also be expected to do its share. Many of our people have objected to any contribution being given by the city unless the bridge is built opposite the town, and the CHRONICLE like every other good citizen of Quebec would prefer to see it constructed at Diamond Harbor, and has contended {{in the interests of the}} city for this site as long as there seemed to be any possibility of securing it there. It would still do so if it appeared that our people could have it at that site. A bridge at Diamond Harbor would, it estimated, cost at least eight millions. It would be very nice to have, with its double track, electric car track, and roads for vehicles and pedestrians, and would no doubt create a goodly traffic between the two towns, and be one of the show works of the continent.|$|E
