5|$|Another {{team from}} the British Antarctic Survey arrived at the <b>ice</b> <b>stream</b> on 8 December 2006 {{for the first of}} two field seasons. In the second field season, they spent three months there from November 2007 to February 2008. Work on the glacier {{included}} radar measurements and seismic surveys.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>ice</b> <b>stream</b> accelerates it is {{also getting}} steeper. The rate of {{thinning}} within the central trunk has quadrupled from 1995 to 2006. If {{the current rate of}} acceleration were to continue the main trunk of the glacier could be afloat within 100 years.|$|E
40|$|Models that {{simulate}} {{sheet flow}} in the Greenland Ice Sheet balance forces at gridpoints in the map plan, which allows only a slow response to changes in climate forcing. A holistic approach to modeling allows a rapid response {{that takes place in}} <b>ice</b> <b>streams.</b> Holistic modeling results are presented that lengthen and lower the profiles of Greenland <b>ice</b> <b>streams.</b> This occurs because surface meltwater from greenhouse" warming reaches the bed through crevasses, and thereby increases basal water pressure. Thinning is then controlled primarily by increased basal water pressure that lengthens <b>ice</b> <b>streams.</b> If thinning caused by this process is both rapid and simultaneous for the major Greenland <b>ice</b> <b>streams,</b> the resulting iceberg outbursts might trigger an episode of rapid climate change...|$|R
50|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>streams</b> rapidly channel <b>ice</b> {{flow out}} to the sea or ocean, where it may feed into an ice shelf. At the margin between ice and water, ice calving takes place, with icebergs {{breaking}} off. <b>Ice</b> <b>streams</b> are bounded on the sides by areas of slowly moving ice.|$|R
40|$|Although it {{is widely}} {{understood}} that {{the collapse of the}} West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) would cause a global sea-level rise of 6 m, there continues to be considerable debate about the response of this ice sheet to climate change. The stability of the WAIS, which is characterized by a bed grounded well below sea level, may depend on geologically controlled conditions at the base, which are independent of climate. <b>Ice</b> <b>streams</b> moving up to 750 m/yr disperse material from the interior through to the oceans. As these <b>ice</b> <b>streams</b> tend to buffer the reservoir of slow-moving inland ice from exposure to oceanic degradation, understanding the ice-streaming process is important for evaluating WAIS stability. There is strong evidence that <b>ice</b> <b>streams</b> slide on a lubricating layer of water-saturated till. Development of this basal layer requires both water and easily eroded sediments. Active lithospheric extension may elevate regional heat flux, increase basal melting, and trigger <b>ice</b> <b>streaming.</b> If a geologically defined boundary with a sharp contrast in geothermal flux exists beneath the WAIS, <b>ice</b> <b>streams</b> may only be capable of operating as a buffer over a restricted region. Should ocean waters penetrate beyond this boundary, the ice-stream buffer would disappear, possibly triggering a collapse of the inland ice reservoir. Aerogeophysical evidence for active volcanism and elevated heat flux beneath the WAIS near the critical region where <b>ice</b> <b>streaming</b> begins is presented...|$|R
5|$|The area drained by Pine Island Glacier {{comprises}} about 10% of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Satellite measurements {{have shown}} that the Pine Island Glacier Basin has a greater net contribution of ice to the sea than any other ice drainage basin in the world and this has increased due to recent acceleration of the <b>ice</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{discharge}} of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is via the five major ice streams (faster flowing ice) entering the Ross Ice Shelf, the Rutford <b>Ice</b> <b>Stream</b> entering Ronne-Filchner shelf of the Weddell Sea, and the Thwaites Glacier and Pine Island Glacier entering the Amundsen Ice Shelf. Opinions differ as to the present mass balance of these systems (Bentley 1983, 1985), principally because of the limited data. The West Antarctic Ice Sheet is stable {{so long as the}} Ross Ice Shelf is constrained by drag along its lateral boundaries and pinned by local grounding.|$|E
25|$|Thompson left Munich in 1798. His successor, Baron von Werneck, {{attempted}} to make the garden pay for itself through its agricultural use. To that end he expanded the park in December 1799 to encompass the Hirschau, which was improved to provide pasture. The fields of the military gardens {{were added to the}} Englischer Garten in January 1800. Werneck's improvements had been costly, and in 1804 he was replaced by Sckell, who was given the post of Bayerischer Hofgärtenintendant ("Bavarian Court Garden Supervisor"). Although Sckell had had a guiding role from the beginning, many aspects of the execution differed from his ideas, which he set out in a memorandum of 1807. His long supervision of the garden (1804–1823) was marked by a movement away from agricultural uses and by concentration on the landscape garden. For instance, two mills {{at the point where the}} Schwabingerbach (Schwabing stream) leaves the Eisbach (<b>Ice</b> <b>stream)</b> were removed and an artificial waterfall was created in 1814-1815.|$|E
40|$|We use aerogeophysical data to {{estimate}} the distribution of marine subglacial sediments and faultâ€bounded sedimentary basins beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). We find that significant ice flow occurs exclusively in regions covered by subglacial sediments.

We predict that the inland migration of <b>ice</b> <b>streams</b> B and C 1 towards the ice divide outside the region covered by marine or rift sediments is unlikely.

500|$|The first {{expedition}} {{to visit the}} <b>ice</b> <b>stream</b> was a United States over-snow traverse, where they spent around {{a week in the}} area of PIG during January 1961. They dug snow pits to measure snow accumulation and carried out seismic surveys to measure ice thickness. One of the scientists on this traverse was Charles R. Bentley, who claims [...] "we didn't know we were crossing a glacier at the time." [...] This is not surprising, because PIG is around [...] wide at the point visited and at ground level cannot be visually distinguished from the surrounding ice. This expedition was called the Ellsworth Highland Traverse.|$|E
500|$|The {{speed of}} Pine Island Glacier {{increased}} by 73percent from 1974 {{to the end}} of 2007, with an 8percent increase over the last 16months of this period alone. This speed up has meant {{that by the end of}} 2007 the Pine Island Glacier system had a negative mass balance of 46gigatonnes per year, which is equivalent to [...] per year global sea level rise. In other words, much more water was being put into the sea by PIG than was being replaced by snowfall. Measurements along the centre of the <b>ice</b> <b>stream</b> by GPS demonstrated that this acceleration is still high nearly [...] inland, at around 4percent over 2007. It has been suggested that this recent acceleration could have been triggered by warm ocean waters at the end of PIG, where it has a floating section (ice shelf) approximately [...] long. It has also been shown that PIG underwent rapid thinning during the Holocene, and that this process may continue for centuries after it is initiated.|$|E

In spite of the obstacles, Kamb managed to successfully develop a new ice coring drill that provides samples needed to solve these complications. In order to study these <b>ice</b> <b>streams,</b> Kamb and a team of 13 to 14 people made expeditions to the Antarctic from October, 2002, to January, 2003.

2500|$|This {{motion is}} thought to occur in two main modes: pipe flow {{involves}} liquid water moving through pipe-like conduits, like a sub-glacial river; sheet flow involves motion of water in a thin layer. [...] A switch between the two flow conditions {{may be associated with}} surging behaviour. Indeed, the loss of sub-glacial water supply has been linked with the shut-down of ice movement in the Kamb <b>ice</b> <b>stream.</b> The subglacial motion of water is expressed in the surface topography of ice sheets, which slump down into vacated subglacial lakes.|$|E
40|$|Ice {{sheets are}} among the key {{controls}} on global climate and sea level. A detailed understanding of their dynamics is crucial to make accurate predictions of their future mass balance. <b>Ice</b> <b>streams</b> are the dominant negative component in this balance, accounting for up to 90 % of the Antarctic ice flux into ice shelves and ultimately into the sea. Despite their importance, our understanding of ice-stream dynamics is far from complete. A range of observations associate <b>ice</b> <b>streams</b> with meltwater. Meltwater lubricates the ice at its bed, allowing it to slide with less internal deformation. It is believed that <b>ice</b> <b>streams</b> may appear due to a localisation feedback between ice flow, basal melting and water pressure in the underlying sediments. This thesis aims to address the instability of ice-stream formation by considering potential feedbacks between the basal boundary and ice flow. Chapter 2 considers ice-flow models, formulating a model {{that is capable of}} capturing the leading-order dynamics of both a slow-moving ice sheet and rapidly flowing <b>ice</b> <b>streams.</b> Chapter 3 investigates the consequences of applying different phenomenological sliding laws as the basal boundary condition in this ice-flow model. Chapter 4 presents a model of subglacial water flow below ice sheets, and particularly below <b>ice</b> <b>streams.</b> This provides a more physical representation of processes occurring at the bed. Chapter 5 then investigates the coupled behaviour of the water with the sediment, and Chapter 6 the coupled behaviour of the water with the ice flow. Under some conditions this coupled system gives rise to <b>ice</b> <b>streams</b> due to instability of the internal dynamics. This thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

2500|$|Tidal {{effects are}} also important; the {{influence}} of a 1m tidal oscillation can be felt as much as 100km from the sea. [...] On an hour-to-hour basis, surges of ice motion can be modulated by tidal activity. [...] During larger spring tides, an <b>ice</b> <b>stream</b> will remain almost stationary for hours at a time, before a surge of around a foot in under an hour, just after the peak high tide; a stationary period then takes hold until another surge towards the middle or end of the falling tide. At neap tides, this interaction is less pronounced, without tides surges would occur more randomly, approximately every 12 hours.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1971, Bryce Jordan {{became the}} university's first {{president}} and served until 1981. At {{that time the}} campus consisted of only one facility, the Founders Building. During Jordan's 10-year tenure the university received [...] of land in 1972 from the Hoblitzelle Foundation and the campus expanded {{with the addition of}} a number of new facilities including the Hoblitzelle Hall, Cecil H. Green Hall, J. Erik Jonsson Hall, Lloyd V. Berkner Hall, the Eugene McDermott Library, a campus bookstore and the Visual Arts Building. The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted accreditation to UT Dallas in 1972 and in 1973 the first UT Dallas diplomas were awarded. Prior to 1975 only graduate students were enrolled. Juniors and seniors were admitted for the first time in 1975 and enrollment increased from 700 in the fall of 1974 to 3,333 in 1975 and by the fall of 1977 to more than 5,300 students. The university's first bachelor's degree was awarded at the school's spring commencement in 1976. The Callier Center for Communication Disorders became part of the University of Texas at Dallas in 1975 as part of the School of Human Development (now the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences). Also in 1975, the School of Management opened and has become the university's largest and offers programs at the undergraduate, graduate and executive levels. UT Dallas's first Nobel laureate, the late Polykarp Kusch, was a member of the physics faculty from 1972 to 1982. When he retired, the university endowed a program of annual lectures with the theme Concerns of the Lively Mind in his honor. Robert H. Rutford, an Antarctic explorer recognized with the naming of the Rutford <b>Ice</b> <b>Stream</b> and Mount Rutford in Antarctica, became the second president of UT Dallas in May 1982. Rutford served as head of the university until 1994. During his tenure as president, the university secured approval for a school of engineering, added freshmen and sophomores to its student body and built the first on-campus housing. UT Dallas school of engineering opened in 1986 due to the efforts of business, community and education leaders. The Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science is now the second-largest school at the university. By its 20th anniversary, in 1989, enrollment at UT Dallas topped 8,000. In 1990, the Texas Legislature authorized the university to admit freshman and sophomore students. [...] The Dallas philanthropist Peter O'Donnell had pushed for expansion of the university into a four-year institution. The Arts and Technology Building at UT-Dallas was named in 2013 in honor of O'Donnell's wife, Edith Jones O'Donnell. It was designed by VAI Architects and STUDIOS Architecture. The Edith O'Donnell Arts and Technology Building boasts 155,000 square feet and cost $60 million to build (20% of the building materials were recycled content). [...] The new building features an anechoic chamber, 3D art studios, a recording studio, a motion capture lab, and other classrooms purposed for arts and technology. The Edith O'Donnell Arts and Technology Building was also selected by the Nasher Sculpture Center as part of a ten location exhibit called the Nasher XChange.

40|$|The {{resilience}} of the Antarctic Ice Sheet {{and its effect}} on global sea level depends on the dynamics of <b>ice</b> <b>streams.</b> Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>streams</b> are known to be responsive to changes at the ocean interface and, as expected, most have thinned in response to ocean warming and sea-level rise since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Here we provide direct and unexpected evidence that points toward the glacial/interglacial stability of the Slessor and Recovery glaciers, <b>ice</b> <b>streams</b> of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) which merge with the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) to form the Filchner Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea embayment. Cosmogenic-nuclide measurements in the Shackleton Range suggest that the Slessor and Recovery <b>ice</b> <b>streams</b> were not significantly thicker than today during the LGM. We hypothesise that the glaciers did not thicken because the grounding line was not able to migrate seaward beyond the deep Thiel/Crary Trough beneath the Filchner Ice Shelf immediately offshore. This discovery reveals how a topographic threshold can affect the dynamics of <b>ice</b> <b>streams.</b> It also reduces uncertainties on the thickness, extent and volume of the Antarctic Ice Sheet in a large but unknown sector of the Antarctic Ice Sheet; it constrains the potential sea-level rise from Antarctica; it helps explain observed anomalies in glacio-isostatic adjustment; above all it suggests that the behaviour of the Atlantic-facing Weddell Sea sector of the WAIS contrasts with that of the Pacific-facing Ross and Amundsen Sea sectors...|$|R
