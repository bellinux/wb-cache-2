5|$|Approximately 100 {{species of}} mammal {{are known to}} inhabit, or to have {{recently}} inhabited, the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding waters. This includes a few species that were introduced in the 20th century; the coypu was introduced for farming in the 1990s, and the muskrat {{was introduced in the}} early 20th century into the Russian Far East and was subsequently first recorded in Korea in the Tumen River basin in 1965.

The north room of the attic floor and principal room {{on the first floor}} include 16th- or early-17th-century timber panelling. The room over the entrance hall features late-17th-century panelling. Two period staircases feature; one from each of the 16th and 17th centuries. The windows in the entrance hall and north room of the east range include armorial stained glass windows dated 1567, 1567 and 1575. The stairwell includes windows with 17th-century German stained glass taken from the adjacent church of St Peter and other, undated stained glass.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several {{other types of}} tectonic terrain. Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain. These fractures probably propagate down {{only a few hundred}} meters into the crust. Many <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture. Another example of tectonic features on Enceladus are the linear grooves first found by Voyager 2 and seen at a much higher resolution by Cassini. These linear grooves can be seen cutting across other terrain types, like the groove and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, they are among the youngest features on Enceladus. However, some linear grooves have been softened like the craters nearby, suggesting that they are older. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not nearly to the extent as those seen on Europa. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed. Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history.|$|E

25|$|When Attenborough {{resigned}} from his administrative duties {{to return to}} programme making {{at the start of}} 1973, planning for the proposed series resumed. It was another three years before the resourcing and financing were agreed, the outline episode scripts written (by Attenborough) and a production team in place. Parsons would serve as series producer and share production duties for the individual episodes with Richard Brock and John Sparks. Filming took place in 39 countries, featured over 650 different species and involved over 1 million miles of travel. Attenborough himself has said that {{if it had not been}} for computerised airline schedules, the series would <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> impossible to undertake. When it was finally broadcast in 1979 on BBC 1, Life on Earth drew an audience of 15 million people in the UK and was eventually seen by an estimated 500 million people worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Although the maguari stork largely {{depends on}} shallow freshwaters {{as a source}} of prey, it has also been {{observed}} to forage solitarily on dry plains outside the breeding season where mice and toads (candidate prey) sometimes occur in large numbers. It also forages on dry, cultivated fields where invertebrates <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> disturbed. During the evenings in the dry season from December until April, individuals form large assemblages around low-lying water features where prey density is high but prey abundance is not. Notably numerous assemblages of foraging maguari storks have been sighted in the Brazilian municipality Quissama during the dry season in October, where they congregate around shallow pools in search of food. The maguari stork's tendency to forage in both wetlands and dry lands reflects its generalist nature, whereas specialists such as the jabiru depend more on wetlands {{as a source of}} food and are sighted more frequently near to wetlands than the maguari stork.|$|E
500|$|Washington {{anticipated}} that General Howe and his troops would either flee {{or try to}} take the hill, an action that would <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> reminiscent of the Battle of Bunker Hill, which was a disaster for the British. [...] If Howe decided to launch an attack on the heights, Washington planned to launch an attack against the city from Cambridge. [...] As part of the preparations, he readied two floating batteries and boats sufficient to carry almost 3,000 troops. Washington's judgment of Howe's options was accurate; they were exactly the options Howe considered.|$|E

Veronica checks Stacy's room and finds Troy's name half-erased. Stacy {{receives}} a box of someone else's hair outside her door, and Veronica deduces that there <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> other victims of the rapist, so she goes looking for someone who bought a wig recently, finding no one. Dean informs Veronica that the fraternity has a contest about how many girls they have had sex with, and the recruit with the lowest number of [...] "points" [...] is punished by being forced to shave his head. Veronica tracks down Stacy's rape to someone named [...] "Ice Man." [...] She barges into the fraternity's basement, where she is stopped by two members.|$|E
500|$|It {{is often}} {{incorrectly}} {{assumed that he}} insisted {{that the rate of}} change must be constant, or nearly so, but even the first edition of On the Origin of Species states that [...] "Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found {{in the midst of a}} multitude of extinct forms... The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus". Lingula is among the few brachiopods surviving today but also known from fossils over 500 million years old. In the fourth edition (1866) of On the Origin of Species Darwin wrote that [...] "the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form." [...] Thus punctuationism in general is consistent with Darwin's conception of evolution.|$|E

500|$|Philip K. Dick {{refused a}} $400,000 offer {{to write a}} Blade Runner novelization, saying: [...] " [...] told the cheapo novelization would have {{to appeal to the}} twelve-year-old audience" [...] and it [...] "would <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> {{disastrous}} to me artistically". He added, [...] "That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization– they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles." [...] Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? was eventually reprinted as a tie-in, with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the Blade Runner title. Additionally, a novelization of the movie entitled Blade Runner: A Story of the Future by Les Martin was released in 1982. Archie Goodwin scripted the comic book adaptation, , published in September 1982.|$|E
500|$|The {{origin of}} bird flight itself is still hotly debated. It {{is clear that}} {{feathers}} {{must have been a}} prerequisite for flight in birds (though flight may have not been a prerequisite for feathers). There has yet to be a consensus on whether flight involved from the ground up or the trees down, and Heilmann was largely responsible for popularizing the trees-down idea early on. The modern idea of the arboreal (or trees-down) hypothesis has changed little since Heilmann's time, and it states that bird flight would have originated by climbing birds gliding down from the tops of trees, making gliding a precursor to flapping or powered flight. As these early birds became more efficient gliders, they would have begun to extend their range and capability by developing more powerful flight. In this proposed mode of bird evolution, Heilmann's [...] "Proavis" [...] is strongly implicated, which would <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> a climbing, perching, early-stage gliding quadruped. This hypothesis for the origin of bird flight has had many adherents, including Walter J. Bock and Alan Feduccia.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, past macroevolution can be {{inferred}} from historical traces. Transitional fossils, for example, provide plausible links between several different groups of organisms, such as Archaeopteryx linking birds and dinosaurs, or the Tiktaalik linking fish and limbed amphibians. Creationists dispute such examples, from asserting that such fossils are hoaxes or that they belong exclusively to one group or the other, to asserting {{that there should be}} far more evidence of obvious transitional species. Darwin himself found the paucity of transitional species {{to be one of the}} greatest weaknesses of his theory: Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record. Darwin appealed to the limited collections then available, the extreme lengths of time involved, and different rates of change with some living species differing very little from fossils of the Silurian period. In later editions he added [...] "that the periods during which species have been undergoing modification, though very long as measured by years, <b>have</b> <b>probably</b> <b>been</b> short in comparison with the periods during which these same species remained without undergoing any change." [...] The number of clear transitional fossils has increased enormously since Darwin's day, and this problem has been largely resolved with the advent of the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which predicts a primarily stable fossil record broken up by occasional major speciations.|$|E
