5|$|The Cat's Eye Nebula is {{structurally}} a {{very complex}} nebula, and the mechanism or mechanisms that {{have given rise to}} its complicated morphology are not well understood. The central bright part of the nebular consists of the inner elongated bubble (inner ellipse) filled with <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> It in turn is nested into a pair of larger spherical bubbles conjoined together along their waist. The waist is observed as the second larger ellipse lying perpendicular to the bubble with <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, fuel {{flows through}} the main fuel valve into {{regenerative}} cooling systems for the nozzle and MCC, or through the chamber coolant valve. Fuel passing through the MCC cooling system then passes back through the LPFTP turbine before being routed either to the fuel tank pressurization system or to the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> manifold cooling system (from where it passes into the MCC). Fuel in the nozzle cooling and chamber coolant valve systems is then sent via pre-burners into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited again in the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> manifold, from where it passes into the MCC injectors. Once in the injectors, the propellants are mixed and injected into the main combustion chamber where they are ignited. The burning propellant mixture is then ejected through the throat and bell of the engine's nozzle, the pressure of which creates the thrust.|$|E
5|$|The Sun is {{contained}} within the Local Bubble, a space of rarefied <b>hot</b> <b>gas,</b> possibly produced by the supernova remnant Geminga. The distance between the local arm and the next arm out, the Perseus Arm, is about 6,500 light-years. The Sun, and thus the Solar System, is found in what scientists call the galactic habitable zone.|$|E

5|$|Ultraviolet and X-ray telescopes {{can observe}} highly {{energetic}} galactic phenomena. Ultraviolet flares are sometimes observed when {{a star in}} a distant galaxy is torn apart from the tidal forces of a nearby black hole. The distribution of <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> in galactic clusters can be mapped by X-rays. The existence of supermassive black holes at the cores of galaxies was confirmed through X-ray astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Zinc powder is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} propellant in model rockets. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction. This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts of <b>hot</b> <b>gas,</b> heat, and light.|$|E
5|$|Block I (RS-25B) – First flown on STS-70, the Block I engines offered {{improved}} turbopumps featuring ceramic bearings, {{half as many}} {{rotating parts}} and a new casting process {{reducing the number of}} welds. Block I improvements also included a new, two-duct powerhead (rather than the original design, which featured three ducts connected to the HPFTP and two to the HPOTP), which helped improve <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> flow, and an improved engine heat exchanger.|$|E

50|$|French firefighters used an {{alternative}} method in the 1970s: spraying {{water on the}} hot walls to create a water vapor atmosphere and asphyxiate the fire. This method is no longer used because {{it turned out to}} be risky; the pressure created pushed the <b>hot</b> <b>gases</b> and vapor towards the firefighters, causing severe burns, and pushed the <b>hot</b> <b>gases</b> into other rooms where they could start other fires.|$|R
5|$|Lying {{within the}} bounds of the {{constellation}} is the gigantic Phoenix cluster, which is around 7.3 million light years wide and 5.7 billion light years away, {{making it one of the}} most massive galaxy clusters. It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 new stars a year. Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012. Located around 7.2 billion light years away, it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of <b>hot</b> <b>gas,</b> seen in X-rays and infrared images.|$|E
5|$|Once in the engine, the {{propellants}} {{flow through}} low-pressure fuel and oxidizer turbopumps (LPFTP and LPOTP), {{and from there}} into high-pressure turbopumps (HPFTP and HPOTP). From these HPTPs the propellants take different routes through the engine. The oxidizer is split into four separate paths: to the oxidizer heat exchanger, which then splits into the oxidizer tank pressurization and pogo suppression systems; to the low pressure oxidizer turbopump (LPOTP); to the high pressure oxidizer preburner, from which it is split into the HPFTP turbine and HPOTP before being reunited in the <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> manifold and sent on to the main combustion chamber (MCC); or directly into the main combustion chamber (MCC) injectors.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide fibers {{are used}} to measure gas {{temperatures}} in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to disturb the flame and their temperature remains close {{to that of the}} local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.|$|E

5|$|A {{much larger}} galaxy cluster is the redshift-0.0354 Abell 2063. The cluster {{is thought to}} be {{interacting}} with the nearby galaxy group MKW 3s, based on radial velocity measurements of galaxies and the positioning of the cD galaxy at the center of Abell 2063. The active galaxy at the center of MKW 3s—NGC 5920—appears to be creating a bubble of <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> from its radio activity. Near the 5th-magnitude star Pi Serpentis lies AWM 4, a cluster containing an excess of metals in the intracluster medium. The central galaxy, NGC 6051, is a radio galaxy that is probably responsible for this enrichment. Similar to AWM 4, the cluster Abell 2052 has central cD radio galaxy, 3C 317. This radio galaxy is believed to have restarted after a period of inactivity less than 200 years ago. The galaxy has over 40,000 known globular clusters, the highest known total of any galaxy as of 2002.|$|E
5|$|Each engine main {{combustion}} chamber (MCC) receives fuel-rich <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> from a hot-gas manifold cooling circuit. The gaseous hydrogen and liquid oxygen enter the chamber at the injector, which mixes the propellants. A small augmented-spark igniter-chamber {{is located in}} the center of the injector, and this dual-redundant igniter is used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion. The igniters are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is self-sustaining. The main injector and dome assembly are welded to the hot-gas manifold, and the MCC is also bolted to the hot-gas manifold. The MCC comprises a structural shell made of Inconel 718 which is lined with a copper-silver-zirconium alloy called NARloy-Z, developed specifically for the RS-25 in the 1970s. Around 390 channels are machined into the liner wall to carry liquid hydrogen through the liner to provide MCC cooling, as the temperature in the {{combustion chamber}} reaches 3300°C (6000°F) during flight – higher than the boiling point of iron.|$|E
5|$|Hill's {{entered his}} first drag race at the Flying Fish Lodge in Karnack, Texas in 1955. Hill drove his home-built hot rod {{to the track}} and won the event. The hot rod had a Model T frame and an Oldsmobile V8 engine. In 1958, he built his second dragster using parts that his {{employer}} allowed him to scavenge {{while working as a}} sales engineer at a foundry in Wichita Falls, Texas. He used the dragster to set the Texas state low elapsed time (e.t.) that year with a 9.93-second pass. The following year, Hill won the state championship with a 9.25-second pass at 161miles per hour (259kilometers per hour). Hill won his first national event in 1959 in a <b>Hot</b> <b>Gas</b> race at an American Hot Rod Association (AHRA) national championship event in Great Bend, Kansas. Hill earned $500 for an appearance at Inyokern, California to race Jack Chrisman and his Sidewinder dragster. One of his four passes in the 1960 event set the B/Gas dragster record at 163.04mph (262.39km/h), so Hill quit his job to become a full-time drag racer. Later that season he set the a new A/Gas low e.t. at 8.84seconds and set the speed record in the class at 161.29mph (259.57km/h).|$|E

25|$|A {{waste heat}} {{recovery}} unit (WHRU) is a heat exchanger that recovers heat from a <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> stream while transferring it to a working medium, typically water or oils. The <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> stream can be the exhaust gas from a gas turbine or a diesel engine or a waste gas from industry or refinery.|$|E

25|$|Most rocket {{engines are}} {{internal}} combustion heat engines (although non combusting forms exist). Rocket engines generally produce a high temperature reaction mass, as a <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> This {{is achieved by}} combusting a solid, liquid or gaseous fuel with an oxidiser within a combustion chamber. The extremely <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> is then allowed to escape through a high-expansion ratio nozzle. This bell-shaped nozzle is what gives a rocket engine its characteristic shape. The effect of the nozzle is to dramatically accelerate the mass, converting most of the thermal energy into kinetic energy. Exhaust speed reaching as high as 10 times {{the speed of sound}} at sea level are common.|$|E

25|$|Plants {{designed}} for lignite (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations {{as varied as}} Germany, Victoria, Australia and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent heat output. Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans. The firing systems also differ from black coal and typically draw <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> from the furnace-exit level and mix it with the incoming coal in fan-type mills that inject the pulverized coal and <b>hot</b> <b>gas</b> mixture into the boiler.|$|E
25|$|An {{object with}} {{relatively}} high entropy is microscopically random, like a <b>hot</b> <b>gas.</b> A known configuration of classical fields has zero entropy: {{there is nothing}} random about electric and magnetic fields, or gravitational waves.
