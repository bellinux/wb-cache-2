5|$|Cooper {{returns to}} his hotel room and orders room service. Before he can read a note that was left earlier by Audrey, Deputy Brennan calls him to inform him that Johnson has been shot. However, a <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> draws {{him away from the}} phone. When he opens the door, an unseen figure shoots him three times.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 2008, the PGPD and PGSO {{raided the}} home of Cheye Calvo, {{the mayor of the}} Town of Berwyn Heights. The raid team did not {{coordinate}} their action with the local police department as required by mutual agreement, nor did they did not obtain a warrant or <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to announce their presence. They raided the house with explosive devices and with firearms drawn. During the course of the raid, they shot and killed the Calvo family's two pet Labrador retriever dogs.|$|E
5|$|The next night, the ghouls {{leave the}} belfry and float into town {{accompanied}} by their straitjacketed, deformed minions. They <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of a student. When he opens it, aroused from sleeping, they hold {{him down and}} carve out his heart while he tries in vain to scream. At Giles' apartment his visiting girlfriend, Olivia, is frightened by one of The Gentlemen outside Giles' window. The following morning in a campus classroom, Giles uses a series of overhead transparencies {{to explain to the}} others that The Gentlemen steal the townspeople's voices so no one can scream as they gather the hearts they need, and that folklore indicates that they have been vanquished before when a princess screamed: the only thing that will kill them is a live human voice.|$|E

5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> only to see Lincoln in frock coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
25|$|Blackpool {{finished}} the 1949–50 season in seventh place. A quarter-final defeat at Liverpool ended the club's FA Cup interest for another season. Blackpool's reserve team, however, won the Central League championship, scoring 82 {{goals in the}} process. They were assisted significantly by Jackie Mudie, who {{was just beginning to}} <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the first team. Other new members included the amateur Bill Slater and Bill Perry. Out went goalkeeper Joe Robinson, who was unable to win back the number-one jersey from Farm, as well as Alex Munro, who retired, and Ron Suart, who joined Blackburn.|$|E
25|$|Caddy and {{teammate}} Billie Smedts were {{embroiled in}} controversy in April {{as a result}} of an attempted prank gone wrong. The pair were arrested at gunpoint by local police after they were spotted wearing balaclavas and attempting to enter a local house in the Geelong suburb of Kardinia Park. They received a warning from police after it was revealed they were attempting to scare teammate Jackson Thurlow and had simply approached the wrong house. A concerned neighbour had called police reporting an armed robbery when she saw the players <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the neighbouring property. The incident was resolved without further action by police or disciplinary action by the club.|$|E

25|$|If a {{criminal}} {{could make it}} to a church, he was given sanctuary. This was a recognition that the Church was a separate jurisdiction. Some law allowed for the criminal to be housed and fed by the clergy for seven days. Bracton recommends 40 days. After this, the reeve would <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{of the church and}} demand that the criminal surrender himself or take the shortest road to a seaport and leave England never to return. If he did not leave the church, he was to be starved. If the criminal stayed {{on the road to the}} seaport, he was to be left unharmed. If he went off the road, he could be killed by the population at large. Condemned criminals and those found with stolen goods were not to be given sanctuary. The wife of such was declared a widow and all lands owned by him were escheated to the Crown.|$|E

[...] He said {{that they wanted to}} restore the old order, and for this purpose, [...] "the enemies of the people" [...] had linked up with the forces of reaction internationally. As a result, several hundred thousand honest people perished. Everyone lived in fear in those days. Everyone expected that at any moment there would be a <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{in the middle of the}} night and that <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> would prove fatal... eople not to Stalin's liking were annihilated, honest party members, irreproachable people, loyal and hard workers for our cause who had gone through the school of revolutionary struggle under Lenin's leadership.

500|$|Patrick Murphy, {{chief of}} police for the Berwyn Heights Police Department, was {{especially}} critical of the county police. [...] Murphy argued that the raid {{could have been prevented}} if his department had handled the situation, stating [...] "you can't tell me the {{chief of police}} of a municipality wouldn't have been able to <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the mayor of that municipality, gain his confidence and enter the residence". [...] Furthermore, according to Mayor Calvo, a memorandum of understanding between the county and the city requires county police to inform the city if an operation is being conducted within their jurisdiction.|$|E

[...] Fisher knew that the FBI's use of his rank could have only come from Häyhänen. Fisher said nothing to the FBI and, after spending twenty-three minutes staring at Fisher, the FBI agents called in the waiting Immigration and Naturalization Service officers who arrested Fisher and detained him under section 242 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.|$|E
500|$|Tolkien {{arrived at}} the Somme in early July 1916. In between terms behind the lines at Bouzincourt, he participated in the assaults on the Schwaben Redoubt and the Leipzig Salient. Tolkien's time in combat was a terrible stress for Edith, who feared that every <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> might carry news of her husband's death. To get around the British Army's postal censorship, the Tolkiens {{developed}} a secret code for his letters home. By using the code, Edith could track her husband's movements on {{a map of the}} Western Front. According to the memoirs of the Reverend Mervyn S. Evers, Anglican chaplain to the Lancashire Fusiliers: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{larger than}} life character, Miller {{is the subject of}} many stories, often apocryphal. One story had Don Bradman {{answering}} a <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> late one night to see Miller dressed in a dinner suit. Miller advised Bradman that, as demanded, he was in bed at curfew and was now going out. His relationship with Bradman was one riddled with friction and mutual antipathy, [...] "...one a roundhead of massive influence, the other a cavalier and maverick". As Bradman moved from batting hero and team captain to selector and administrator, his influence grew; this [...] "...almost certainly cost Miller any chance of captaining his country".|$|E

He starts telling Jemaine that he doesn't need to do this any more but is {{interrupted}} by a <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Bret explains that he called the police to come and save Jemaine. When they enter, they ask Jemaine and Bret if they are prostitutes, to which Jemaine replies [...] "Yes" [...] and Bret replies [...] "No, no. I'm just the guy that wears the big condom". They are both put in jail. Murray comes to bail them out, telling them that he had to spend all of their newly acquired investment return on bail. In the closing scene, a desk-fan knocks over the new cup, causing it to smash on the floor.|$|E
500|$|Don awakens to a <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> It's Andrea, {{still in}} her tight yellow dress. Don directs her to leave {{immediately}} and forces her to go out through the apartment's service elevator. After Don returns to bed, Andrea walks into his bedroom again, having entered through the unlocked back door. She seduces Don and the two end up having sex in his bed. In a post-coital moment, Andrea declares to Don that he will continue meeting her for trysts because he can't change who he is. Don flies off the handle and chokes her to death. Panicking, he kicks her under the bed, but one of her red shoes remains visible, recalling both the visual of Ginsberg's Cinderella pitch and the lone survivor from the Richard Speck murders. Don awakens {{the next morning to}} realize he was having a fever dream. He says nothing of his vision to Megan and tells her she doesn't need to worry about him.|$|E
500|$|The trio finally {{decide that}} {{kidnapping}} Hardenberg {{was wrong and}} take {{him back to his}} house to let him go. As they prepare to leave, Hardenberg gives Jule a letter forgiving her debt and promising not to involve the police. The film ends with Peter, Jan and Jule asleep in the same bed as a group of heavily armed police (Spezialeinsatzkommando) gather outside their flat and <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Jule wakes up when she hears a knock, and the police force their way into the almost-empty flat. Apparently in Barcelona, Jule opens the door to a hotel maid who wishes to clean their room. In the Berlin apartment, the police find a note: [...] "Manche Menschen ändern sich nie" [...] ("many people never change"). In the original German version, the Edukators set off in Hardenberg's boat in the Mediterranean, presumably to disrupt the island signal towers supplying most television programming to Western Europe.|$|E

500|$|Bannon set {{her stories}} in and among gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s that were secret. As {{described}} in Beebo Brinker, {{one had to}} <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and be recognized before being let in. In reality, women {{were not allowed to}} wear pants in some bars in New York City. Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly; a raid on a gay bar prompted the seminal Stonewall riots in 1969 that started the gay rights movement. Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame, little was recorded at the time {{about what it was like}} to be gay then, and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village. In 2007, one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon's work, [...] "I think she rises above the pulp. She wasn't trying to write trash. There wasn't any place for a woman to be writing this kind of material... But I just think the writing's transcended its time and its era and its market." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Bradley, {{editor-in-chief}} of Worth magazine, {{was the first}} mainstream journalist to question the Rolling Stone article, in a blog entry written on November 24, 2014. The entry began drawing national media attention {{in the days after}} paleoconservative pundit Steve Sailer made an entry on his own blog at the Unz Review on November 29 in which he discussed and linked to Bradley's piece. After an interview Erdely gave to Slate, in which she was questioned about the way she investigated the piece, some commentators escalated their questioning of the veracity of the article. It was later revealed Erdely had not interviewed any of the men accused of the rape. Erdely defended her decision not to interview the accused by saying that the contact page on the fraternity's website [...] "was pretty outdated". Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple rejected Erdely's statement, saying that the severity of the accusations she was reporting required [...] "every possible step to reach out and interview them, including e-mails, phone calls, certified letters, FedEx letters, UPS letters and, if all of that fails, a <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> No effort short of all that qualifies as journalism." ...|$|E
