5|$|Despite {{adopting}} a broad principle, the Court did not list any specific rules for how trial <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> to balance evidentiary {{standards and the}} right of the defendant to secure witnesses in his or her favor.|$|E
5|$|After BC {{became a}} Canadian {{province}} in 1871, Crease devoted {{the next few}} years to fighting for judicial independence—specifically the right of judges to live outside their districts. In 1881 the BC Supreme Court, including Crease, ruled in the Thrasher case that the province's attempts to regulate <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> unconstitutional. This decision was overturned two years later by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Saudi Arabia {{uses the}} bench trial system. Its courts observe few formalities. The country's first {{criminal}} procedure code {{was introduced in}} 2001 and contains provisions borrowed from Egyptian and French law. Human Rights Watch, in a 2008 report, noted that <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> either ignorant of the criminal procedure code or were aware of it but routinely ignored the code.|$|E

50|$|Throughout its {{existence}} {{the court had}} two permanent judges at any one time. From 1865 to 1878 and 1905 to 1943 the senior <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> titled <b>Judge</b> and the junior <b>judge's</b> title <b>was</b> Assistant <b>Judge.</b> Between 1878 and 1905 the senior <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> titled Chief Justice and the junior <b>judge's</b> title <b>was</b> <b>Judge.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{case was}} appealed {{again to the}} House of Lords, where it was heard by Lord Bingham, Lord Nicholls, Lord Steyn, Lord Hope, Lord Rodger, Lord Walker, Baroness Hale, Lord Carswell and Lord Brown on 13 and 14 July 2005. Nine <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> {{selected}} to hear the appeal, {{as opposed to the}} usual number of five, due to the significant constitutional issues the case raised.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} fraught with irregularities. All three <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> pro-Goebel Democrats, {{and at one}} point the juror pool of 368 people was found to have only eight Republicans. Republican appeals courts {{overturned}} Powers' and Howard's convictions, though Powers was tried three more times, resulting in two convictions and a hung jury and Howard was tried and convicted twice more. Both men were pardoned in 1908 by Governor Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|All {{the other}} accused lived in Lancashire, {{so they were}} sent to Lancaster Assizes for trial, where the <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> once again Altham and Bromley. The {{prosecutor}} was local magistrate Roger Nowell, who had been responsible for collecting the various statements and confessions from the accused. Nine-year-old Jennet Device was a key witness for the prosecution, something {{that would not have}} been permitted in many other 17th-century criminal trials. However, King James had made a case for suspending the normal rules of evidence for witchcraft trials in his Daemonologie. As well as identifying those who had attended the Malkin Tower meeting, Jennet also gave evidence against her mother, brother, and sister.|$|E

5|$|In February 2010, Dannii Minogue {{confirmed}} {{that she would}} not attend the auditions for series 7 due to being pregnant. It was {{confirmed that}} guest judges would take Minogue's place alongside Simon Cowell, Louis Walsh and Cheryl Cole during the auditions. The guest <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> Geri Halliwell, Natalie Imbruglia, Katy Perry, Pixie Lott and Nicole Scherzinger. On 11 June, Minogue was confirmed by ITV to return for the judges' houses stage. Cole missed the Manchester auditions and bootcamp due to having malaria, so Scherzinger returned as a guest judge for bootcamp. Cole then returned for the judges' houses stage.|$|E
5|$|On 4 March 2013, the BBC {{announced}} they {{were searching for}} a new presenter to start {{in the summer of}} 2013. They announced that CBBC stars Dick and Dom would be hosting a new TV show to find the next presenter. The show began on 24 June as Blue Peter - You Decide!. The <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> Myleene Klass, Eamonn Holmes and Ceallach Spellman. The winner was chosen after five weeks of competition, via a public vote. On 25 July 2013, it was announced that 22-year-old Lindsey Russell had won the public vote to become Blue Peters 36th presenter.|$|E
5|$|The Permanent Court of International Justice was {{provided}} {{for by the}} Covenant, but not established by it. The Council and the Assembly established its constitution. Its <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> elected by the Council and the Assembly, and its budget {{was provided}} by the latter. The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. It might also give an advisory opinion on any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or the Assembly. The Court was open to all {{the nations of the world}} under certain broad conditions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are both}} {{volunteer}} and professional judges. A volunteer judge, {{such as an}} English magistrate, {{is not required to}} have legal training and is unpaid. Whereas, a professional <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> required to be legally educated; in the U.S., this generally requires a degree of Juris Doctor. Furthermore, significant professional experience is often required; for example, in the U.S., <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> often appointed from experienced attorneys. <b>Judges</b> <b>are</b> often appointed by the head of state. In some U.S. jurisdictions, however, <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> elected in a political election.|$|R
5000|$|Criticisms of the {{doctrine}} continue as in the past. Critics argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> making determinations of policy and morality that properly belong with legislators (i.e. [...] "legislating from the bench"), or argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> reading views into the Constitution that are not really implied by the document, or argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> claiming power to expand the liberty of some people {{at the expense of}} other people's liberty (e.g. as in the Dred Scott case), or argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> addressing substance instead of process.|$|R
5000|$|The officiating {{position}} {{titles of}} back judge and field <b>judge</b> <b>were</b> swapped {{to become more}} consistent with college and high school football. The field <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> now 20 yards deep, positioned on the same sideline as the line judge, while the back <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> 25 yards from {{the line of scrimmage}} {{near the center of the}} field.|$|R
5|$|The {{institution}} of the Castellania {{was replaced by the}} Tribunale Provisorio and the Tribunale Civile di Prim'Instanza. The post of Castellano was abolished, and <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> nominated by the Commission de Gouvernement. During the years of French occupation, the building was known as the Palais de Justice. Not less than three full cases of silver secured at the Castellania, were taken by the French on November 8, 1798, and were melted to create coins to remunerate the Jacobins. It was {{one of a series of}} similar reasons that consequently triggered a Maltese revolt. The French law system did not last enough to influence the Maltese courts at the time.|$|E
5|$|Trinidad {{defended his}} {{title for the}} next three years against several opponents. Trinidad's first fight in Las Vegas was against Héctor Camacho on January 29, 1994. He was {{cautious}} during the first rounds and received a cut over his left eye. In the third round he connected a solid combination that made Camacho change to a defensive stance. Throughout the fight Trinidad was on the offensive and won the fight by unanimous decision, in what was his first decision since he won the world championship. The scores awarded by the <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> 117–109, 116–110, and 119–106.|$|E
5|$|Whistler {{submitted}} {{the painting to}} the Academy, but according to Heffernan, he {{expected it to be}} rejected at this point. The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. Edwin Henry Landseer's The Shrew Tamed showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert, a noted equestrienne of the period: however it was soon rumoured that it was actually Catherine Walters, the notorious London courtesan. Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> wary of admitting it. White Girl was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not.|$|E

5000|$|A lay <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> {{a person}} {{assisting}} {{a judge in}} a trial and as such are sometimes called lay assessors. Lay <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> used in some civil law jurisdictions. Japan began implementing a new lay judge system in 2009. Lay <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> appointed volunteers and often require some legal instruction. However, they are not permanent officers, as they tend proceedings about once a month, and often receive only nominal or [...] "costs covered" [...] pay. Lay <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> usually used when the country does not have juries. Lay <b>judges</b> may <b>be</b> randomly selected for a single trial (like jurymen), or politically appointed. In the latter case, they may usually not be rejected by the prosecution, the defense, or the permanent <b>judges.</b> Lay <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> similar to magistrates of England and Wales, but magistrates sit about twice more often.|$|R
5|$|By 1957, the {{old order}} was mostly re-established as {{fourteen}} of the fifteen <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> endorsed for re-election by both parties and returned to office without opposition. The fifteenth, 75-year-old Joseph L. Kun, was President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas and had served on the court for thirty years. In February, lawyers from the city bar association voted by a 2-to-1 margin to not endorse his re-election, calling him unqualified to hold office. Despite the bipartisan effort against him among the city's lawyers, Kun filed for re-election in both parties' primaries. Kun won the Republican nomination handily, but lost the Democratic nomination to Earl Chudoff, {{a member of the}} federal House of Representatives from Pennsylvania's 4th congressional district. In November, Chudoff won easily, taking 58% of the vote. Kun, already in poor health, retired from the profession of law and died in 1961. Chudoff remained on the bench until 1974.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, a later set of {{meetings}} at Champoeg created the Provisional Government of Oregon with a judiciary {{consisting of a}} Supreme Judge and two justices of the peace for trial level courts. Albert E. Wilson was the first judge chosen as the Supreme Judge under this new government, but never served. Other <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> appointed or elected during this pre-territory period {{over the next six}} years. Until 1846 with the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute, the region was not under the jurisdiction of any foreign power. With the resolution of the boundary issue, Britain retained the territory north of the 49th degree of latitude, with the United States taking the land south to the border of Mexican control California.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, {{with the}} rise of {{interest}} in the bell, the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room (also known as the Declaration Chamber) on the first floor, where the Declaration and United States Constitution had been debated and signed. The city constructed an ornate pedestal for the bell. The Liberty Bell was displayed on that pedestal for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later stuffed). In 1853, President Franklin Pierce visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty in the same building in which federal <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> holding hearings under the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E
50|$|A reserve <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> {{a former}} <b>judge</b> or, on occasion, an {{appointed}} official who offers their {{services as a}} substitute judge when required. Reserve judges either supplement judges in jurisdictions {{that do not have}} the number of judges needed, or act as an alternate judge in jurisdictions with a single judge when that <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> substituted or must recuse himself. Reserve <b>judges</b> may also <b>be</b> used as substitutes when another <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> ill or on vacation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{office of}} circuit <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> {{created by the}} Courts Act 1971 and {{replaced}} the former offices of Chairman of Quarter Sessions and Borough Recorder.

5|$|On May 3, men {{claiming}} to be {{acting on behalf of}} Baxter supporters hijacked a train from Memphis, Tennessee, and arrested federal Court Justices John E. Bennett and E.J. Earle, thinking that the Court would be unable to rule without a quorum of Judges. Baxter denied that they were acting under his direction. The <b>Judges</b> <b>were</b> taken to Benton, Arkansas. For several days, their whereabouts were unknown to the public and federal officials began a search for the Justices. Justice Bennett was able to send a letter to Captain Rose demanding to know why they were being held by the Governor of Arkansas. Upon receipt of the letter, troops were sent to Benton to retrieve the two Justices, but they had escaped by May 6 and made their way to Little Rock.|$|E
5|$|The Judge Dredd {{comic strip}} is mostly set in Mega-City One in the 22nd century, {{on the east}} coast of the former United States. When President Robert L. Booth started the Third World War in 2070 (see Atomic Wars), the Judges – until then no more than a police force with {{extraordinary}} powers – deposed Booth, overthrew the Constitution and seized control of all institutions of government. Disillusioned with the elected politicians who had caused so much destruction to their country, much of the American public supported this move at the time. For the next four decades America was a dictatorship. (Mega-City One and the other American mega-cities became sovereign city-states early during this period, and the US ceased to exist.) Although the <b>Judges</b> <b>were</b> initially popular, the citizens soon grew to resent their new leaders as much as they had the old, until activists began calling for a return to democratic government.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} {{presided over by}} ICJ Vice-President Judge Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh, {{alongside}} 13 other judges and two ad hoc judges appointed by the two countries. The <b>judges</b> <b>were</b> Raymond Ranjeva from Madagascar, Shi Jiuyong from the People's Republic of China, Abdul G. Koroma from Sierra Leone, Gonzalo Parra Aranguren from Venezuela, Thomas Buergenthal from the United States, Hisashi Owada from Japan, Bruno Simma from Germany, Peter Tomka from Slovakia, Ronny Abraham from France, Kenneth Keith from New Zealand, Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor from Mexico, Mohamed Bennouna from Morocco and Leonid Skotnikov from Russia. As the Bench of the Court did not include any judges of the nationality of either party, the parties exercised their right to choose judges ad hoc {{to sit in the}} case. Singapore appointed Pemmaraju Sreenivasa Rao from India, and Malaysia Christopher John Robert Dugard from South Africa.|$|E
