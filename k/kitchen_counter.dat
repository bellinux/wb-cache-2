25|$|Corrigan {{had just}} stepped {{out the front}} door when he heard a second shot behind him. He turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with a {{surprised}} look on his face. Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw a closed penknife at Switzer's side, which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the <b>kitchen</b> <b>counter</b> and threaten to kill him too. As Piott begged for his life, they heard emergency sirens. Corrigan thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner's jury.|$|E

Ross returns home, dejected, and finds a message from Rachel on the phone. She explains her actions and decides to get off the plane, but the message cuts off. Ross panickingly tries fixing the answering machine, wondering to himself out loud if she got off the plane. From behind him, Rachel says she did. They kiss and get back together for good, both agreeing that this is where they want to be. The following morning, the friends gather in Monica and Chandler's empty apartment. With some time remaining before Monica and Chandler leave for their new house, the six all leave their keys to the apartment on the <b>kitchen</b> <b>counter</b> and decide to go for one last cup of coffee together, to which Chandler sarcastically quips, [...] "Where?".

2500|$|In the 1980s, {{there was}} a {{backlash}} against industrial kitchen planning and cabinets with people installing a mix of work surfaces and free standing furniture, led by kitchen designer Johnny Grey and his concept of the [...] "unfitted kitchen". Modern kitchens often have enough informal space to allow for people to eat in it without having to use the formal dining room. Such areas are called [...] "breakfast areas", [...] "breakfast nooks" [...] or [...] "breakfast bars" [...] if the space is integrated into a <b>kitchen</b> <b>counter.</b> Kitchens with enough space to eat in are sometimes called [...] "eat-in kitchens".

2500|$|Mobility is {{severely}} restricted by the hip spica cast and walking without crutches or a walker is impossible because the hips cannot bend. There {{is a serious}} danger of falling if the patient in a hip spica cast tries to get upright to walk without assistance because they lack {{the ability to control}} their balance. Patients are normally confined to a bed or reclining wheelchair, or children's stroller. Children in spica casts can sometimes learn to get mobile by scooting around on skateboards, or pulling themselves across the floor. Some children even learn to walk by holding themselves up against furniture. A child in a spica cast must always be supervised and safety must always be considered when they are at a mobile phase of their healing to prevent reinjury or damage to the cast. Many spica casts have a spreader bar between the legs to help strengthen the cast and support the legs in the proper positions. It is important when moving the casted patient to not lift them by this spreader bar, as it may break and this could cause injury to the patient. To facilitate toileting or diaper changing and hygienic cleaning, an opening is created in the cast at the groin. The opening is normally referred to as the [...] "perineal opening". It is formed either during cast application or after cast application by cutting the hole with the cast saw. The opening must then be petalled or lined to keep this area of the cast clean and dry. Because the hips cannot bend, using a toilet is difficult, if not impossible. It is therefore necessary for the patient to either use a diaper, bedpan, or catheters to manage bodily waste eliminations. Bathing must be done by sponge baths. Hair may be shampooed by using plastic wash basins under the head. To shampoo wash the hair of a child, the child can be lifted and placed on a <b>kitchen</b> <b>counter</b> top and their head held over the kitchen sink.|$|E
50|$|Interior {{materials}} vary {{depend on}} their location, either in standard apartments, premium apartments, or common areas.

In the premium apartments, materials include palm and stone flooring, glass tiled bathrooms, and Boffi brand kitchens. In the common areas materials include bamboo wall paneling, stone floors, and white back-lit glass panels. The structural and interior materials are not uncommon in high-end residential projects, but the unconventional form necessitated an innovative approach to methods of construction.|$|R

From websites and mobile devices to computers embedded in appliances on our <b>kitchen</b> <b>counters</b> and automobiles parked in our driveways, {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) and IT artifacts are fundamentally changing the ways we interact with our world. Indeed, the world itself changing, becoming ever more artificial. It is a designed world that we have created for ourselves. Human-computer interaction (HCI) scholars are concerned with the interactions that occur between people and technology in this new world: how do IT artifacts impact the human experience, and how can knowledge of the human experience impact the design of new computer-based systems? At the same time, HCI is design-oriented, a community where scholars seek to shape the design of new IT artifacts, and make real improvements to the world we live in. It remains an unresolved challenge to bring these scholarly and design perspectives together. Various models and approaches have been proposed, but current thinking on a “design science ” for HCI is in flux...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2005 People {{living without}} piped {{water and sewer}} can be at {{increased}} risk for fecal-oral diseases. One Alaskan village that relies on hauled water and honeybuckets was studied to determine the pathways of fecal contamination of drinking water and the human environment so that barriers can be established to protect health. Samples were tested for the fecal indicators Escherichia coli and Enterococcus. Several samples were also tested for the pathogens Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium parvum. All terrain vehicle (ATV) use and foot traffic transported bacteria within the village and into the home. Surface water flow transported bacteria within the community during spring thaw, but flow from the dump did not appear to contribute to contamination in town. Within the home, viable fecal bacteria were found on waterdippers, <b>kitchen</b> <b>counters</b> and floors, and in washbasin water. Giardia was found at the dump, but not in water from the river adjacent the community. Exposure to fecal contamination could be reduced by cleaning up after dogs, careful disposal of honey bucket bags and gray water, and by protecting stored drinking water...|$|R
