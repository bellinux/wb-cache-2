5|$|Aside {{from its}} {{unstable}} position, Halos would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> {{with thousands of}} meteor and micrometeor impacts which would destabilize or destroy the ring; {{there is no evidence}} in the games that the installations project an energy shield to prevent this occurrence. Because of the magnetic environment around the gas giant, a Halo would be exposed to high levels of radiation. Earth is protected from such radiation by charged particles created by the planet's magnetic field. Grazier posits that huge conductive cables could run the circumference of a Halo; when an electric current was run through these cables, a protective magnetic environment could be created to sustain life.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of {{the late}} army <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with a {{dramatic}} diminution of the epigraphic record in the 3rd and 4th centuries, compared with the 1st and 2nd centuries. diplomas were no longer issued to retiring auxiliaries after 203 (most likely because almost all were already Roman citizens by then). In addition, {{there was a huge}} {{reduction in the number of}} tombstones, altars and other dedications by Roman servicemen. Official stamps of military units on building materials (e.g. tiles) are much rarer. But this trend should probably not be seen as indicating a decline in the army's administrative sophistication. Papyrus evidence from Egypt shows that military units continued to keep detailed written records in the 4th century (the vast bulk of which are lost due to organic decomposition). Most likely, the decline in inscriptions is due to changing fashion, in part influenced by the increase in barbarian recruits and the rise of Christianity. The dearth of inscriptions leaves major gaps in our understanding {{of the late}} army and renders many conclusions tentative.|$|E

25|$|During {{the diamond}} cutting process, the diamond cutter {{wants to get}} the {{heaviest}} diamond out of a rough stone. However, this can come {{at the cost of}} lowering cut grade. If a diamond is too deep, the carat weight will increase but result in a loss of brilliance due to light leakage. Diamond cutters <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with working a stone to its best finished form with the least amount of waste. This strategy depends {{on the quality of the}} stone and its final proportions. If two diamonds of equal weight are inspected there can be a noticeable difference in size when viewed from above; arguably the most important view. A well cut 0.90ct diamond for example could have the same width as a poorly cut 1.00ct diamond. This phenomenon is known as spread.|$|E
25|$|Cavity-dwelling species <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> {{with the}} danger of predators {{accessing}} their nest, catching them and their young inside and unable to get out. They {{have a variety of}} methods for decreasing the likelihood of this happening. Red-cockaded woodpeckers peel bark around the entrance, and drill wells above and below the hole; since they nest in live trees, the resulting flow of resin forms a barrier that prevents snakes from reaching the nests. Red-breasted nuthatches smear sap around the entrance holes to their nests, while white-breasted nuthatches rub foul-smelling insects around theirs. Eurasian nuthatches wall up part of their entrance holes with mud, decreasing the size and sometimes extending the tunnel part of the chamber. Most female hornbills seal themselves into their cavity nests, using a combination of mud (in some species brought by their mates), food remains and their own droppings to reduce the entrance hole to a narrow slit.|$|E

25|$|The more {{primitive}} species nest in existing cavities, {{for example in}} an old woodpecker nest, while other species excavate burrows in soft substrate such as sand banks. Swallows in the genera Hirundo, Ptyonoproggne, Cecropis, Petrochelidon and Delichon build mud nests close to overhead shelter in locations that are protected from both the weather and predators. The mud-nesters are most common in the Old World, particularly Africa, whereas cavity-nesters are the rule in the New World. Mud nesting species in particular are limited in areas of high humidity, which causes the mud nests to crumble. Many cave, bank and cliff dwelling species of swallow nest in large colonies. Mud nests are constructed by both males and females, and amongst the tunnel diggers the excavation duties are shared as well. In historical times, the introduction of man-made stone structures such as barns and bridges, together with forest clearance, {{has led to an}} abundance of colony sites around the globe, significantly increasing the breeding ranges of some species. Birds living in large colonies typically <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with both ectoparasites and conspecific nest parasitism. Old males benefit most from coloniality, since they are able to maintain their own nests and benefit from frequent extra-pair copulations.|$|E
25|$|Confusion between {{ship and}} shore {{led to the}} South Saskatchewans {{reducing}} their defensive perimeter too quickly, yielding the western heights to German infantry. The original order for evacuation was for 10:00 but was changed to 11:00. The change proved disastrous for the assault troops, as the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada had already started to withdraw to the beach at 09:30, closely followed by the Saskatchewans. They would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with the increasing enemy action for another hour, despite the perimeter now being {{too close to the}} beach. At about 10:30, all available craft were sent to Green Beach at Dieppe, which was still under intense fire from mortars and machine-guns. At 10:45, six LCAs came inshore to Green Beach under heavy fire. It was a mistake; the evacuation should have begun on Red Beach. As Alasdair Ferguson grounded his LCA, he could see no movement on the beach. Moments later, so many troops were rushing Ferguson's craft that it was swamped and, as he made out to sea, the craft was hit by a shell and capsized. He helped the survivors board another craft, and the traumatized sailors and soldiers returned to Newhaven. The other five LCAs participated in a chaotic evacuation, taking men aboard and clearing the beach successfully, but casualties mounted. A second flight of LCAs appeared soon after, but the state of the tide was changing markedly and the risk of becoming stranded kept the LCAs well off shore. The loss of the western heights and the receding tide made further attempts to evacuate most costly. Heavy losses occurred on the sand and in the water. By 11:30, the few men left on the beach were overwhelmed by an enemy attack and captured while attempting to disengage.|$|E
25|$|Richery {{made for}} St. John's, {{estimating}} {{that with his}} superior firepower, he could pound Fort Amherst into submission. However, upon entering the harbour, he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with the three smaller forts William, Waldegrave, Chainrock, a guard tower, {{and one of the}} largest fortresses in North America, Fort Townshend. Therefore, landing on the interior of the harbour was not seen as a feasible goal. Outnumbered at sea, the British retired behind the forts and batteries of St. John's and prepared to put up stiff resistance. It was the morning of 2 September 1796 when the French fleet was sighted off the coast. Wallace did not have a large garrison in St. John's at the time, so he tried {{to give the impression that}} he had. This was intended to make the French believe that St. John's would be too costly to try to take. He had his men erect tents on both sides of the entrance to the Narrows and then marched them to and fro at Fort Amherst and below Signal Hill. Richery was handicapped by having no intelligence of the defenses of St. John's and no pilots for Newfoundland waters. He had to depend for information on John Morridge, master of a fishing ship belonging to Governor Wallace, who was one of the prisoners taken at Bay Bulls. Richery's huge fleet hove to off Cape Spear for a day observing the daunting sight. The next morning, Richery formed a battle line and drove for the harbour entrance. As they came within the range of the twenty-four pounders at Fort Amherst, his resolve weakened. Tacking the great ships, he headed back out to sea. The ruse had worked and the town saved. Admiral Richery's threat to St. John's finally came to nothing in face of the vigour of the new Governor, Admiral Sir Richard Wallace, who raised volunteers, strengthened the forts, and prepared new batteries.|$|E

500|$|The art {{and science}} writer Peter Forbes notes that Thayer became obsessed by the [...] "flattening effect" [...] of countershading, and that {{far from being a}} scientist, he was [...] "an artist whose idealist fervour, edged by deep insecurity, led him to regard his {{findings}} less as discovery than as revelation." [...] Describing Concealing-Coloration as a [...] "magnum opus", Forbes writes that by 1909 [...] "Thayer's prophetic intolerance was in full flood", that he was overcompensating for his need for approval of his artwork, and that he failed to see that acceptance of ideas in science does not depend on [...] "the vehemence with which they are expressed". In Forbes's view, Thayer was battling for the rights of artists over scientists, citing Thayer ("it properly belongs to the realm of pictorial art") in evidence. Apart from Thayer's [...] "bizarre" [...] flamingos, Forbes calls Thayer's opposition to Batesian mimicry [...] "extreme". For Forbes, [...] "Reading Thayer's book today is a strange experience. He sets out with the idea that every single creature is perfectly camouflaged", and then [...] "tries to bludgeon his readers" [...] into agreeing. Forbes is critical of Thayer's rejection of warning coloration, quoting Thayer's daughter Gladys as writing [...] "My father's special mission was tasting butterflies"; Thayer apparently wanted to prove that mimicry was the wrong explanation as both model and mimic tasted the same. Forbes observes that natural selection did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with human reactions to the taste of butterflies.|$|E

500|$|A {{third major}} league, the Federal League (FL), began play in 1914 and lasted for two years. While the Yankees did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>contend</b> with direct {{competition}} for fans, as the FL chose to place its New York City franchise in Brooklyn instead of Manhattan, the team nearly lost leading pitcher Ray Caldwell to the rival league after the 1914 season. With the Yankees finishing seventh in 1913 and sixth in 1914, Farrell and Devery sold {{the team to}} brewery magnate Jacob Ruppert and former United States Army engineer Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston. The Yankees had rarely been profitable over the previous 10 years, and carried debts of $20,000. The sale was completed on January 11, 1915, as the pair paid a combined $460,000. Ruppert called the team [...] "an orphan ball club, without a home of its own, without players of outstanding ability, without prestige." [...] The new owners intended to spend freely to improve the club's talent level and made a major purchase in 1915, buying pitcher Bob Shawkey from the Philadelphia Athletics. In spite of this, the Yankees' 69 wins were only enough for fifth in the league. After wearing different designs during the Highlanders years, in 1915 the Yankees introduced white uniforms with pinstripes and an interlocking [...] "NY" [...] logo during games at the Polo Grounds; this remains their home uniform design today.
