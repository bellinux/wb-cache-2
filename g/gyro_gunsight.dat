25|$|The idea of {{windscreen}} projection {{had been}} attempted with the AI Mk. IV as the Mk. V, {{but a number}} of problems had been found and it was not adopted for service. Several updated versions were used in trials, but by 1943 the Mk. V radar was obsolete, and the Pilot's Indicator Display (PID) was instead adapted to the Mk. VIII. This time the system's output was not a separate CRT, but instead projected into the existing GGS Mk. II <b>gyro</b> <b>gunsight.</b> The system was fit to Mosquito HK419 some time in late 1943, and sent to the FIU for testing in January 1944. It received widespread praise.|$|E
500|$|The Hunter {{featured}} a nose-mounted ranging radar, providing range input to the <b>gyro</b> <b>gunsight</b> for air-to-air gunnery only.

These were nicknamed [...] "Sabrinas", after the buxom actress of the time. Several variants were fitted with tail-mounted brake parachutes. Typically, export Hunters were equipped to {{be compatible with}} additional types of missiles, such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missile and the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-surface missile.|$|E
500|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} {{aircraft}} was its use of [...] "Metalite" [...] for its skin. This was made of balsa that was sandwiched between two thin sheets of aluminum.

Two fuel tanks were fitted {{in the center of}} the fuselage. The forward tank, ahead of the wing, contained [...] and the rear tank, [...] These were supplemented by two jettisonable [...] tip tanks. The cockpit was well forward and was provided with a bubble canopy which gave the pilot good visibility. He was provided with a Mk 6 lead-computing <b>gyro</b> <b>gunsight.</b> Underneath the cockpit were four 20mm (0.79in) M3 autocannon. Their 600 rounds of ammunition were carried behind the pilot. The empty casings of the two upper guns were retained in the aircraft, while those from the two lower guns were ejected overboard.|$|E

2500|$|While {{not always}} able to avoid contact with the escorts, the threat of mass attacks and later the [...] "company front" [...] (eight abreast) assaults by armored Sturmgruppe Fw 190s brought an urgency to attacking the Luftwaffe {{wherever}} it could be found, either in the air or on the ground. Beginning in late February 1944, 8th Air Force fighter units began systematic strafing attacks on German airfields with increasing frequency and intensity throughout the spring {{with the objective of}} gaining air supremacy over the Normandy battlefield. In general these were conducted by units returning from escort missions but, beginning in March, many groups also were assigned airfield attacks instead of bomber support. The P-51, particularly {{with the advent of the}} K-14 <b>Gyro</b> <b>gunsight</b> and the development of [...] "Clobber Colleges" [...] for the training of fighter pilots in fall 1944, was a decisive element in Allied countermeasures against the Jagdverbände.|$|E

50|$|HUDs {{evolved from}} the {{reflector}} sight, a pre-World War II parallax-free optical sight technology for military fighter aircraft.

50|$|Reflector sights {{were first}} {{used as a}} weapon sight in German {{aircraft}} {{towards the end of}} World War I.

50|$|There were {{problems}} with the 30 mm MK 108 Motorkanone, which often jammed while the aircraft was manoeuvring in battle, leaving the pilot to fight on with the two heavy machine guns.

50|$|A <b>gyro</b> <b>gunsight</b> (G.G.S.) is a {{modification}} of the non-magnifying reflector sight in which target lead (the amount of aim-off {{in front of a}} moving target) and bullet drop are allowed for automatically, the sight incorporating a gyroscopic mechanism that computes the necessary deflections required to ensure a hit on the target. The sight was developed just before the Second World War for aircraft use during aerial combat.|$|E

50|$|The system {{consisted}} of a transmitter/receiver unit mounted in the navigator's compartment, operating through a conical scanning parabolic aerial attached to the standard Frazer-Nash turret. It worked on a wavelength of 9.1 cm (3 GHz) with a pulse repetition frequency of 660 hertz. The magnetron used was the CV186 of approx 35kW. The electronics sent a signal back to the turret, where it was displayed on a cathode ray tube (CRT) display screen positioned adjacent to the gun sight, the image of which was projected on to the Mark IIC <b>gyro</b> <b>gunsight</b> via a semi-transparent mirror.|$|E

50|$|A long, pointed nose leads {{back to the}} tandem cockpit, {{in which}} the student and {{instructor}} sit on Czech-built VS-1 ejection seats under individual canopies, which are opened manually and are hinged on the right. The rear seat, typically used by the instructor, is elevated slightly to readily enable observation and guidance of the student's actions in the forward position. The design of the cockpit, panel layout {{and many of its}} fittings resemble or are identical in function to those of other commonly-used Soviet aircraft, such as the procedure for deploying the ejection seat being exactly the same as that used upon the Mikoyan MiG-29. The cockpit is highly pressurized, requiring the air crew to wear oxygen masks only when flying in excess of 23,000 feet. A <b>gyro</b> <b>gunsight</b> for weapon-aiming purposes is typically present in the forward position only.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1940s, the Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE), {{in charge of}} UK radar development, found that Royal Air Force (RAF) night fighter pilots were {{having a hard time}} {{reacting}} to the verbal instruction of the radar operator as they approached their targets. They experimented {{with the addition of a}} second radar display for the pilot, but found they had trouble looking up from the lit screen into the dark sky in order to find the target. In October 1942 they had successfully combined the image from the radar tube with a projection from their standard GGS Mk. II <b>gyro</b> <b>gunsight</b> on a flat area of the windscreen. A key upgrade was the move from the original AI Mk. IV radar to the microwave-frequency AI Mk. VII radar found on the de Havilland Mosquito night fighter. This set produced an artificial horizon that further eased head-up flying.|$|E

5000|$|After {{tests with}} two {{experimental}} gyro gunsights which {{had begun in}} 1939, the first production <b>gyro</b> <b>gunsight</b> was the British Mark I Gyro Sight (left), developed at Farnborough in 1941. To save time in development the sight {{was based on the}} already existing type G prismatic sight, basically a telescopic gun sight folded into a shorter length by a series of prisms. Prototypes were tested in a Supermarine Spitfire and the turret of a Boulton Paul Defiant {{in the early part of}} that year. With the successful conclusion of these tests the sight was put into production by Ferranti, the first limited-production versions being available by the spring of 1941, with the sights being first used operationally against Luftwaffe raids on Britain in July the same year. The Mark I sight had a number of drawbacks however, including a limited field of view, erratic behavior of the reticle, and requiring the pilot/gunner to put their eye up against an eyepiece during violent maneuvers.|$|E
