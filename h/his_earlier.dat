5|$|Goffman {{saw this}} book as his magnum opus, {{but it was}} not as popular as <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>earlier</b> works {{included}} publications {{on social}} criticism and reform of universities, including The University Game, co-edited with Dennis Lee (1968), The Beds of Academe (1970), and The Holiversity (1973).|$|E
5|$|In 1991 D.E. Yount {{described}} a development of <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> bubble model, the Varied Permeability Model, and the 1992 French civilian Tables du Ministère du Travail (MT92) {{also have a}} bubble model interpretation.|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>early</b> artwork began about 1963, {{and many}} of <b>his</b> <b>early</b> barn {{paintings}} were reminiscent of masterpieces by Andrew Wyeth and Eric Sloane.|$|R
5000|$|His father, Hugues Merle, {{was also}} a painter. As Georges rarely signed <b>his</b> <b>early</b> pieces, several of <b>his</b> <b>early</b> works were at first mistakenly {{attributed}} to his father.|$|R
5000|$|Not much {{is known}} about <b>his</b> <b>early</b> works except that <b>his</b> <b>early</b> style {{exhibited}} modernist forms. Exiled museum director [...] noted in the late thirties that Ziegler was ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the first}} part of the show, Castro {{performed}} songs from the disc sporting a white tuxedo. In the second he performed hits from <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> career.|$|E
5|$|Rod Temperton, one of Jackson's songwriters from <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> career, {{believes}} that this is his best song.|$|E
5|$|A certain {{detail that}} comes up in the novel is whether we are limited to certain realities, such as 2+2=4, a theme that also comes up in Yevgeny Zamyatin's We and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Dostoevsky {{continues}} {{the use of this}} symbol from <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> work Notes From Underground where the narrator rants about determinism and logic.|$|E
2500|$|Many of <b>his</b> <b>earliest</b> {{works were}} signed {{a small number}} of <b>his</b> <b>early</b> creations were simply signed [...] [...] At least one {{triptych}} from 12Meiji (1879) exists signed [...]|$|R
50|$|The {{collection}} {{was one of}} the earliest published works of Shelley and one of <b>his</b> <b>earliest</b> political works. The work was reprinted in 1877. Shelley expressed <b>his</b> <b>early</b> political views on government, war, and society.|$|R

5|$|Baker's {{work has}} {{achieved}} cult {{status in the}} years since his death, and two additional novels have been posthumously published. First-edition copies of <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works have become collector's items. His novel Testosterone was adapted to a film of the same name, though it was not a financial success. Two other books have been optioned for films, but they have not been produced.|$|E
5|$|Bear McCreary {{was hired}} to compose the score for the series. McCreary stated that the main theme was based on his viewing of {{production}} designs for the opening title sequence. Instead of doing a full theme song as with <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works, McCreary chose to use a simple, repeating motif from the strings section.|$|E
5|$|By 1960 Moore {{was moving}} on from <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works, {{directly}} {{inspired by the}} human form and with textured surfaces, such as Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, to more rounded abstract shapes, inspired by the shapes of stones or bones. Moore made a connected work in 1961, also inspired by bone, Standing Figure (Knife Edge) (LH 482).|$|E
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to prophesy {{the success of a}} man of letters from <b>his</b> <b>early</b> promise, <b>his</b> <b>early</b> tastes; as impossible as it is to predict, from her childish grace, the beauty of a woman.|$|R
50|$|As Frampton's {{photography}} {{moved toward}} exploring ideas of series and sets, {{he began to}} make films. He based a lot of <b>his</b> <b>early</b> films on concepts, which he applied. All of <b>his</b> very <b>early</b> works were either discarded or lost. <b>His</b> <b>earliest</b> surviving work was Information (1966). <b>His</b> <b>early</b> works were reasonably simple in construction. A few of them including Maxwell's Demon, Surface Tension, and Prince Rupert's Drops were based on concepts from science, a subject he was knowledgable of. As he got on, his films gradually increased in scope and ambition.|$|R
25|$|Hamza Hakimzade Niyazi wrote <b>his</b> <b>earliest</b> poems {{under the}} pen name Nihoniy. <b>His</b> <b>earliest</b> {{collection}} of poems, Devoni Nihoniy (Nihon's Diwan) in tajik (persian), {{was found in}} 1949 and had 197 poems that he had written in 1903–04.|$|R
5|$|Chabas studied under {{artists such}} as Tony Robert-Fleury, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, and Albert Maignan. Although <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works were {{generally}} portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of light with the models and their surroundings. September Morn is typical of his style.|$|E
5|$|Having {{replaced}} {{his agent}} following <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> inability {{to sign with}} Colorado, Tanguay agreed to {{a contract with the}} Avalanche during the season and was assigned to Colorado's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters, after his junior season ended. He scored one goal and two assists in five regular season games and added two assists in five playoff games.|$|E
5|$|Hence he devotes {{much space}} to {{justifying}} <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> work, asserting that mathematical concepts may be freely introduced {{as long as}} they are free of contradiction and defined in terms of previously accepted concepts. He also cites Aristotle, Descartes, Berkeley, Leibniz, and Bolzano on infinity.|$|E
50|$|In <b>his</b> <b>early</b> career, before 1930, Sobrat {{produced}} mainly Wayang (shadow style) paintings. Some of <b>his</b> <b>early</b> works can {{be found}} in the Museum Puri Lukisan in Ubud, Bali, Indonesia. Sobrat produced many portraits, mostly of his daughter.|$|R
5000|$|Halpenny {{is noted}} for his [...] "ability {{to write about}} things many people take for granted", {{especially}} from <b>his</b> <b>early</b> days of writing, where he had from <b>his</b> <b>early</b> teens been studying and writing about traditions and culture.|$|R

5|$|His choral {{compositions}} feature rich harmony, vocal polyphony, and imitation. <b>His</b> <b>earlier</b> choral {{arrangements of}} folk songs were primarily strophic arrangements of the melody. As the composer gained more experience, {{the structure of}} his choral compositions and arrangements of folk songs became more frequently intertwined with text.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>earlier</b> {{books as}} Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his {{doctoral}} {{expertise in the}} field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and AIDS. He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Tesla evaded {{conscription}} {{into the}} Austro-Hungarian Army in Smiljan by running away southeast of Lika to Tomingaj, near Gračac. There he explored the mountains wearing hunter's garb. Tesla {{said that this}} contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally. He read many books while in Tomingaj and later said that Mark Twain's works had helped him to miraculously recover from <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> illness.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} on 4 April 1962 {{in the village of}} Gadli, Jandiala in {{district}} Amritsar and received <b>his</b> <b>early</b> education in <b>his</b> native village of Gadli in district Amritsar. After completing <b>his</b> <b>early</b> education, he enrolled in Khalsa College, Amritsar.|$|R
50|$|Pisanello's life is {{somewhat}} shrouded in mystery. He was born between 1380 and 1395 and died between 1450 and 1455 (probably between 14 July and 8 October 1455). He {{was a native}} of Pisa but spent <b>his</b> <b>early</b> years in San Vigilio sul Lago in the territory of Verona. He was probably given <b>his</b> <b>early</b> training by a Veronese painter (perhaps Altichiero or Stefano da Verona) as <b>his</b> <b>early</b> style is in the tradition of Veronese painting.|$|R
50|$|This is <b>his</b> <b>early</b> career.|$|R
5|$|In 1941 Amir {{published}} another {{collection of}} poems, entitled Buah Rindu ("Fruits of Longing"), which consisted mostly of <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> works. Jassin {{notes that the}} works in Nyanyi Sunyi appear more developed and mature {{than those in the}} later collection. Teeuw notes that the later collection was more explicitly about romantic love, rather than the religious love of Nyanyi Sunyi.|$|E
5|$|In {{the book}} Okonkwo {{struggles with the}} legacy of his father– a shiftless debtor fond of playing the flute– {{as well as the}} {{complications}} and contradictions that arise when white missionaries arrive in his village of Umuofia. Exploring the terrain of cultural conflict, particularly the encounter between Igbo tradition and Christian doctrine, Achebe returns to the themes of <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> stories, which grew from his own background.|$|E
5|$|In the book, Hemingway explores {{conflict}} {{within a}} marriage, {{the conflict between}} the European and native cultures in Africa, and the fear a writer feels when his work becomes impossible. The book includes descriptions of <b>his</b> <b>earlier</b> friendships with other writers and digressive ruminations on the nature of writing.|$|E
50|$|In <b>his</b> <b>early</b> life, he {{was born}} in Beijing, China. He began {{training}} martial arts and Kung Fu with his father Simon Yuen Siu-tien at an <b>early</b> age. In <b>his</b> <b>early</b> life, he also appeared in some movies with Hong Kong famous actors.|$|R
50|$|Despite <b>his</b> <b>early</b> {{interest}} in music, he studied Medicine at UCL {{and continues to}} work part-time as a doctor. He composed soundtracks for numerous short films during <b>his</b> <b>early</b> medical career, {{one of which was}} nominated for a BAFTA Cymru award in 2005.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, the Dutch {{record label}} Rarity Records {{released}} the compilation In <b>His</b> <b>Early</b> Days by The Dynamic Rockers Featuring John Spencer that includes 16 songs. [...] The {{second and third}} volume of In <b>His</b> <b>Early</b> Days are then released in 1992.|$|R
