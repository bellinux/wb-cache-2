MethodsIn vitro (micro) propagation of K. galanga {{was done by}} inoculating explants on to Murashige and Skoog agar medium, supplemented with suitable combinations of phytohormones; the regenerants were transferred to soil for further growth. Essential oil preparations of both CP and IVP rhizomes grown in soil, obtained by the hydro-distillation method were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Antioxidant activities of essential oil samples were monitored. ResultsMaximum numbers of regenerated shoots {{were found in the}} medium supplemented with 1 mg/L benzyl adenine and 0. 5 mg/L indole- 3 -acetic acid. A total of 6 compounds were identified from rhizomes from CP and IVP plants that yielded 96. 9 % and 97. 81 % of the total oil contents, respectively. The major compound of rhizome oil identified from CP and IVP rhizomes was <b>ethyl</b> p-methoxy <b>cinnamate</b> in quantities, 82. 01 % and 71. 77 %, respectively, without any compositional variation. Antioxidant properties of essential oil preparations were assessed by the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging assays. Moreover, antioxidant activities of rhizome-oil from IVP plants were better than that of CP oil samples. ConclusionsAs IVP rhizomes had better oil yield, those could be used for a large scale commercial propagation for sustainable use of essential oil.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A short series of diazo compounds containing a primary alcohol and one or more other carbene traps were synthesised. The result in each case, from rhodium (11) acetate mediated decomposition where products could be isolated was that O-H insertion is observed {{at the expense of}} all other intramolecular processes. A few other catalysts were tried and a similar result was observed. Even catalysts such as copper (11) acetate, commonly used for cyclopropanations did not lead to any cyclopropanes, O-H insertion being the only observed product. The variation of the rate of decomposition of a small selection of diazo compounds with a range of rhodium (11) catalysts is described. The catalysts chosen represent a wide range of ligand pKa, (0. 17 -t 12. 40, trifluorobutyrate and acetamide respectively). The results show that the rate of decomposition of the diazo substrates is at a maximum when the pKa of the ligand is [...] 10. The relative rates of decomposition of the diazo compounds are unaffected by the catalyst used. The synthesis of a-alkoxyesters by rhodium mediated decomposition of a-diazoesters was considered. Use of ethyl 2 -diazo- 3 -phenylpropanoates leads to the formation of O-H insertion products and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cinnamates.</b> The ratio of insertion product to cinnamate was found to vary with the ligand on rhodium..

Extracts of the plant using methanol have shown larvicidal activity against the second-stage larvae of dog roundworms (Toxocara canis). It was also found to be effective as an amebicide in vitro against three species of Acanthamoeba, which cause granulomatous amebic encephalitis and amebic keratitis. In 1999, the rhizome extract was found to inhibit activity of Epstein-Barr virus. Further research has demonstrated the extract effectively kills larvae of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus and repels adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, both of which are serious disease vectors.

Raising the beer pH additionally causes the release of 3 -(methylthio) propionaldehyde from sulfitic adducts.

The XRD pattern confirmed the presence of crystalline palladium. The effect of pH on the formation of nanoparticles is insignificant, but precipitation occurs above pH 5. However, it does not influence the shape of nanoparticles but slightly affect their size [24]. It was noticed that nearly 60  % of PdCl 2 was reduced to palladium nanoparticles when only 5 -ml extract was treated with 50  ml of 1  mM PdCl 2 at 30  °C. Higher concentration of the biomaterial may reduce the remaining 40  % PdCl 2; otherwise, the suspension would contain both the Pd 2 + ions and palladium nanoparticles. The C. zeylanicum bark extract is known to contain linalool, eugenol, methyl chavicol, cinnamaldehyde, <b>ethyl</b> <b>cinnamate</b> and β-caryophyllene [25] which have distinct aroma and convert Pd ions to Pd nanoparticles. However, no clear mechanism has been given for the reduction process of PdCl 2 to Pd nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|Exposure of ethyl 2 -cyano- 3 -(2 -methoxy- 5 -nitrophenyl) {{acrylate}} if to triethylamine in hot ethanol {{resulted in}} the formation of the dihydro derivative 2 f and vinylogue 3 f in high yields. Single crystal X-ray data are provided for 3 f. Similar reactions were observed for various analogues. The reaction was studied changing aryl substituent, amines and solvents. Pyridyl, thienyl analogues were also examined. The study was extended to cyclic molecules incorporating such systems like thiazolidinedione 8, 3 -cyanocoumarin 9 and 4 -arylidene-isoquinoline- 2, 4 -diones 11. The last group gave vinylogated products, 4 -cinnamylidene-isoquinolinediones and 4 -hydroxylated species. A few examples of arylidene derivatives from malononitrile, ethyl acetoacetate, acetyl acetone and ethyl methylsufonylacetate were investigated. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>cinnamate</b> and beta-nitrostyrene were unaffected. The reaction is considered to be possibly radical mediated, since addition of free radical quencher suppressed the reaction. Contrary to the effects of thermal conditions, irradiation of If in ethanol at 254 and 365 nm gave complex mixtures. A few other interesting observations in this study are noted: vinylogation of If with acetaldehyde to 3 f; formation of 3 f from if by the treatment with triethylamine, palladium carbon and reduction of if to 2 f by triethylammonium formate in DMF.

40|$|Grape-derived {{volatile}} compounds, {{including those}} released from odourless glycosidic precursor {{present in the}} grape, are strongly associated with the varietal aroma characteristic of non-aromatic wines. In this study, free and glycosidically bound volatile compounds of Fiano grapes have been identified and quantified by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The free volatile fraction of Fiano grapes was mainly characterised by the occurrence of several aliphatic alcohols, with minor amounts of the monoterpenes linalool and geraniol, and traces of the norisoprenoid β-damascenone. The volatile fraction obtained from either enzymatic or acid hydrolysis of juice glycosides was more complex, and contained compounds belonging to the chemical classes of terpenes, norisoprenoids, benzenoids, and aliphatic alcohols. Linalool, geraniol, teprinen- 4 -ol, 1, 1, 6 -trimethyl- 1, 2 -dihydronaphtalene (TDN), β-damascenone, (E) - 1 -(2, 3, 6 -trimenthylphenyl) buta- 1, 3 -diene (TPB), <b>ethyl</b> <b>cinnamate,</b> and 4 -vinyl guaiacol were detected by GC-olfactometry (GC-O) as odorants of young Fiano wine that were formed through hydrolysis of grape precursors. Pathways of formation of these compounds during winemaking were investigated. Yeast-driven enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosides was the major route for linalool and geraniol formation, while acid hydrolysis {{led to the formation}} of terpinen- 4 -ol, TDN, β-damascenone, TPB, and ethyl cinnamat...|$|E
40|$|Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) fruit {{accumulate}} (hydroxy) cinnamoyl glucose (Glc) esters, {{which may}} serve as the biogenetic precursors of diverse secondary metabolites, such as the flavor constituents methyl cinnamate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>cinnamate.</b> Here, {{we report on the}} isolation of a cDNA encoding a UDP-Glc:cinnamate glucosyltransferase (Fragaria × ananassa glucosyltransferase 2 [FaGT 2]) from ripe strawberry cv Elsanta that catalyzes the formation of 1 -O-acyl-Glc esters of cinnamic acid, benzoic acid, and their derivatives in vitro. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that FaGT 2 transcripts accumulate to high levels during strawberry fruit ripening and to lower levels in flowers. The levels in fruits positively correlated with the in planta concentration of cinnamoyl, p-coumaroyl, and caffeoyl Glc. In the leaf, high amounts of Glc esters were detected, but FaGT 2 mRNA was not observed. The expression of FaGT 2 is negatively regulated by auxin, induced by oxidative stress, and by hydroxycinnamic acids. Although FaGT 2 glucosylates a number of aromatic acids in vitro, quantitative analysis in transgenic lines containing an antisense construct of FaGT 2 {{under the control of the}} constitutive 35 S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter demonstrated that the enzyme is only involved in the formation of cinnamoyl Glc and p-coumaroyl Glc during ripening...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the role}} of Ixodes ricinus (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) in the {{transmission}} of many serious pathogens, personal protection against bites of this tick is essential. In the present study the essential oils from 11 aromatic Egyptian plants were isolated and their repellent activity against I. ricinus nymphs was evaluated Three oils (i. e. Conyza dioscoridis L., Artemisia herba-alba Asso and Calendula officinalis L.) elicited high repellent activity in vitro of 94, 84. 2 and 82 %, respectively. The most active essential oil (C. dioscoridis) was applied in the field at a concentration of 6. 5 A mu g/cm(2) and elicited a significant repellent activity against I. ricinus nymphs by 61. 1 %. The most repellent plants C. dioscoridis, C. officinalis and A. herba-alba yielded essential oils by 0. 17, 0. 11 and 0. 14 %, respectively. These oils were further investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. alpha-Cadinol (10. 7 %) and hexadecanoic acid (10. 5 %) were the major components of C. dioscoridis whereas in C. officinalis, alpha-cadinol (21. 2 %) and carvone (18. 2 %) were major components. Artemisia herba-alba contained piperitone (26. 5 %), <b>ethyl</b> <b>cinnamate</b> (9. 5 %), camphor (7. 7 %) and hexadecanoic acid (6. 9 %). Essential oils of these three plants have a potential to be used for personal protection against tick bites...|$|E
