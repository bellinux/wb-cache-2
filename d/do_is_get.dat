25|$|Sudden death also {{occurs in}} {{computer}} gaming when both teams {{have the same}} score and a method of breaking a tie is needed. For example, in a Capture the Flag area for Quake III Arena, when neither team has scored, or if no team leads, a sudden death match will decide {{who will be the}} victor. All the teams have to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>get</b> the flag and deliver it to the base one time only in order to win automatically. Sometimes, players share a handicap in order to end the game faster; for example, in a Super Smash Bros. sudden death match, players fight beginning at 300% damage, amplifying how much they are knocked back to the extent that most attacks will KO them in a single blow. In games where the players normally would respawn, like Team Fortress 2, sudden death often means that respawning is disabled and the last team standing wins.|$|E

One missed tackle {{could be a big}} play... With the throwing game, there could be a lot of one-on-one situations. To me, it's pick your poison. What they do best is run it. What we'd like to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>get</b> them off schedule. If they mix it, then we're in trouble." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between both managers was evidently hostile to begin with. Ferguson noted that Wenger {{was the only}} manager he came across in the league not to share a drink with after matches – an English football [...] "tradition". In a joint interview with The Times and Daily Mail in 2009, Wenger said his discourtesy was mistaken for mistrust and managers [...] "cannot be completely friendly and open up." [...] When asked {{if this was the}} reason he avoided the post-match drink, he replied: [...] "Most of the time, yes. What can you say if you have won? And if you have lost all you want to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>get</b> home and prepare for the next game." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{first thing}} his manager <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>get</b> {{me in my}} bedroom, which was also the office, and corner me about the 1,500 bucks. I {{realized}} that if she was in here, then DOOM was with Madlib, and the longer I kept up this charade with her, the longer they’ll vibe and maybe it all might work out.|$|R
500|$|D'Esposito {{chose to}} {{differentiate}} the short from The First Avenger by avoiding the sepia tone used for that film by director Joe Johnston, instead using a cooler blue color. The production used two old lenses (for both night and day) {{that gave the}} short some [...] "better" [...] lens flares that D'Esposito felt gave the period setting a more modern feel. D'Esposito used a Steadicam or a camera dolly for the action sequences, to avoid a [...] "quick cutty or blurry or shaky" [...] feel. D'Esposito said that the crew was ultimately [...] "pushing our limit" [...] to get the planned shots on schedule, and he eventually realized that he [...] "wasn’t going to get every shot and I wasn’t going to get every punch and kick, so what we <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>get</b> the optimum".|$|E
500|$|The band {{said that}} while {{producing}} the song, they attempted to find out [...] "how to make dance music" [...] without turning themselves into a dance act. Armstrong {{said it was the}} first time the band had written a dance song. Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound compared the song with the works of The Rapture and The Clash's 1982 album, Combat Rock; he said it was [...] "strictly for basement dancefloors everywhere". According to Armstrong, the lyrics of [...] "Kill the DJ" [...] can be considered as [...] "a sweeping political statement" [...] rather than being interpreted as [...] "a comment on electronic music figures". He told Rolling Stone the song is about [...] "static and noise...Like this government cannot, will not, agree with itself. They refuse to make it work. Right, left—it doesn’t matter. It blows your mind and pisses you off. It’s a song about being drunk, going through this chaos, feeling fucked up and all you want to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>get</b> more drunk".|$|E
500|$|Cooder {{recorded}} most of Election Special at Drive-By Studios, {{the living}} room of engineer Martin Pradler's house in North Hollywood. Sessions also took place at Wireland Studios in Chatsworth, California. Pradler later mixed and mastered the album at both recording locations. The album was produced entirely by Cooder. He performed most of the album himself, playing bass, guitar, and mandolin. His son Joachim contributed on drums, and session musician Arnold McCuller sung harmony vocals on the song [...] "Take Your Hands off It". At Drive-By Studios, Cooder recorded songs in a series of unrehearsed, single-take performances, which he felt helped him channel the songs' respective characters more efficiently. He later said of his approach to developing the songs, [...] "The way I think these songs can work is if you don't ponder over it too hard, because the tunes wanna have a spontaneous-combustion effect. What I want to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>get</b> a certain attitude in the voice, and I can only do that once. By take two, I'm startin' to think about it. By take three, I'm startin' to map it out – it's gone. It's spoiled, y'see? So I need to get through this fast." [...] He first recorded the song [...] "The Wall Street Part of Town" [...] in November 2011. On June 7, 2012, the album's release was announced for a date in August, intended to be a week before the 2012 Republican National Convention.|$|E

[...] Aware that his mother had been watching the game on TV, he had an equipment manager call and tell her he loved her. Then he asked for a priest.|$|R

500|$|Retrospective reviews {{have been}} more negative. In 2014, David Sims of The Wire listed Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut in his list of [...] "directors' cuts messed up their own movies". Sims disliked the lack of {{ambiguity}} in Kelly's new version, and argued that [...] "crowbarring [...] into his director's cut made for a lesser movie". Similarly, Tom Hawking of Flavorwire felt that the director's cut ruined the [...] "enduring ambiguity" [...] of the original. Hawking included Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut in his 2010 list of [...] "10 director's cuts that are worse than the original". Writing in Collider.com {{for a review of}} the 10-year anniversary Blu-ray, Scott Wampler said that he felt [...] "let-down" [...] by the director's cut, and that it was [...] "right in line with the sort of choices [...] made as a filmmaker since releasing Donnie Darko". In the Total Film book The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, where the original cut of Donnie Darko was listed at number 87, Jonathan Dean also criticized this loss of ambiguity, remarking: [...] "Unwisely building concrete bypasses over gossamer plot strands, [...] steers us through a spaghetti junction of possible meanings when all we really want to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>get</b> lost." [...] In a 2016 retrospective review, Germain Lussler of io9 stated that the director's cut [...] "simply isn't as good" [...] and [...] "feels less magical". He argued that the inclusion of The Philosophy of Time Travel [...] " [...] the film from being a text that the viewer could read into whatever they wanted".|$|E
500|$|BuzzFeed {{compiled}} a list citing [...] "15 Times Jasmine From 'Aladdin' Was The Most Feminist Disney Princess". The same website included Jasmine rejecting traditional standards of marriage second on its list of [...] "27 Feminist Disney Moments That Unapologetically Smashed The Patriarchy". Ranking Jasmine second on a list analyzing [...] "Which Disney Princess Most Embodies Feminist Principles", author Shannon Larson of The Huffington Post appreciated the character for rejecting the idea of marriage being necessary, asserting her right to marry whomever and owning her sexuality, but criticized {{the fact that she}} does not complete her attempt to escape royal oppression. Sonia Saraiya of Nerve ranked Jasmine fifth in her article [...] "Ranked: Disney Princesses From Least To Most Feminist". Saraiya praised her personality, likening her boldness, curiosity, and skepticism of marriage to that of Belle while commending her for [...] "falling for a completely inadequate 'street rat' and whisking him out of poverty, instead of the other way around." [...] However, Saraiya labeled Jasmine's use of sexuality her [...] "only power", criticizing her for sending a negative message to young girls. When questioned about whether or not Jasmine is a positive role model because [...] "all she wants to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>get</b> married", Larkin defended her character, explaining, [...] "That's not true. Jasmine says to a generation of little kids about marriage that the law is wrong. She risks everything—her safety, her comfort, everything she knows—and goes out and finds a way to change the marriage law... Yeah, she's a good role model!' Really good! Whether it's connected or not, that person that the writers created that I got to portray, I'm so proud of her. And I feel like she was ahead of her time." [...] Meanwhile, Jasmine's inability to recognize Aladdin despite his disguise has been met with controversy, comparing this characteristic to the relationship between Lois Lane and Clark Kent/Superman, and questioning the princess' intelligence.|$|E
2500|$|On March 26, 2010, Schoeneweis {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with a spring training invitation with the Boston Red Sox.

[...] According to Red Sox pitching coach John Farrell, {{one of the main}} factors in the competition for the final two roster spots in the bullpen was [...] "being able to match up left on left". [...] Red Sox manager Terry Francona said: [...] "I haven't even seen Schoeneweis yet, but the one thing he's been able to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>get</b> left-handers out."

2500|$|A minor {{controversy}} arose over Silverman's {{performance in}} the documentary film The Aristocrats (2005). The film shows her doing the Aristocrats joke [...] a sample of transgressive art told by numerous comedians since the vaudeville era [...] like it was an autobiographical account of {{her life as a}} child sex performer. [...] As part of the routine, she mentions that Joe Franklin, a New York radio and TV personality whose nostalgic programs aired from the early 1950s until shortly before his death in 2015, would ask her to perform privately for him in his apartment. Silverman looks at the camera and, in a deadpan voice, accuses Franklin of raping her. The film was edited {{in such a way that}} it appears as if Franklin knows what Silverman said about him. Later, after her clip, Franklin is shown stating, [...] "Sarah Silverman is a young lady to watch." [...] After the film came out, Franklin took offense at Silverman's using his name in the routine and considered suing her. A month later, The New York Times noted he remained undecided but had said, [...] "The best thing I could <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>get</b> Sarah better writers so she'd have funnier material." ...|$|E
