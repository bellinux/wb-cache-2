5000|$|In 2000, a {{group called}} [...] "Raise the Gunboats" [...] in Benton County, Tennessee {{attempted}} to salvage the remaining portions of the Undine. The group has had mixed success, with some artifacts from the gunboat recovered {{as well as a}} <b>derrick</b> <b>boat</b> from the turn of the century.|$|E

At top, the Clifton Park-West Lake Bridge carries U.S. Route 6 across the river.

5|$|She was {{modified}} at Chatham Dockyard {{for use as}} a target ship between 6 December 1920 and 8 April 1921. The ship was rewired for radio control and stripped; the 12-inch turrets remained aboard, but all of her guns and their equipment were removed, as were her torpedo equipment, flying deck, sea cabins, main <b>derrick</b> and <b>boat</b> equipment, lower conning tower, masts and yards, most of her crew amenities, and other unnecessary equipment. Unnecessary hatches, coamings, scuttles, and lifts were removed and plated over, and she was ballasted differently than she had been as a battleship. It was not intended to sink her, so she was assigned a crew of 153 to maintain and operate her when she was not under fire.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Jake spots Laura and Zane on {{the island}} and forces Derrick to rescue them. <b>Derrick</b> crashes the <b>boat</b> into some rocks, {{flooding}} the boat's lower deck and causing the boat to begin sinking. Kelly is trapped in the kitchen while Derrick, Crystal and Andrew fall overboard from the impact of the collision. Crystal is devoured, and Andrew escapes to shore unharmed. Meanwhile, Danni manages to get a partially eaten Derrick back on board, where he then dies.|$|R
50|$|With {{the chicken}} farm struggling, a local informs <b>Derrick</b> of Garnet's <b>boat</b> plot, and {{he finds himself}} once again despised. He buries himself in the farm and his writing, but after a week he comes across Phyillis alone, and {{explains}} his actions to her. He declares his love, and she returns it, revealing that Chase is in fact engaged to her sister Norah, but adds that her father, loathing Garnet, would never consent to them marrying. On Ukridge's advice, they beard {{the man in the}} sea, and Garnet announces his love for Phyllis, but only makes Derrick angrier.|$|R
50|$|<b>Derrick</b> <b>Boat</b> No. 8, {{also known}} as DB 8, is a {{historic}} floating derrick located at Oswego, Oswego County, New York. It was built in 1927, {{and it is one}} of the few surviving steam-powered floating derricks to have worked on the New York State Barge Canal. It has a 75 foot by 28 foot hull composed of both riveted and welded heavy steel plate. The site of the vessel’s caretaker is the H. Lee White Marine Museum.|$|E
50|$|Oswego has a {{long history}} {{stretching}} back to the 15th century. Visitors can learn about the city's history by visiting museums such as the H. Lee White Marine Museum, The Richardson-Bates House, and Fort Ontario. Throughout the city and public parks, many historical monuments can be found honoring historical figures, and other forts that stood in what is now the historical district. The city includes a number of sites on the National Register of Historic Places including the <b>Derrick</b> <b>Boat</b> No. 8, Kingsford Historic District, Market House, Oswego Armory, Oswego City Hall, Oswego City Library, Oswego County Courthouse, Oswego Yacht Club, Tanner Block, and U.S. Customhouse.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{conversion}} work proceeded into the autumn, all torpedo gear {{was removed from}} both ships, as were two of each ship's 4-inch guns, the 3-inch antiaircraft gun, their depth charge tracks, and the forward two boilers. Additional deckhouse space was added forward. Internal arrangements were changed to accommodate the personnel of a 12-plane patrol plane (VP) squadron and a supply of aviation gasoline. A <b>boat</b> <b>derrick</b> {{was added to the}} existing searchlight tower structure to handle a pair of 30-foot motor launches to be used for tending the planes in the water. The ship retained her forward and aftermost 4-inch guns, and four [...]50-caliber machine guns were added for antiaircraft defense.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1918, the Commander-in-Chief, Grand Fleet, Admiral David Beatty, {{had called}} for a large target to be {{provided}} which would allow realistic gunnery practice for the battleships of the Grand Fleet, which had seen little action since the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Tests against armour plate in 1919 demonstrated that firing 15-inch (381-mm) guns at any pre-dreadnought would sink her quickly, {{but the use of}} a pre-dreadnought for target practice and tests by guns of 6-inch calibre (152-mm) or smaller seemed practical. At first the pre-dreadnought [...] was suggested for target duties, but ultimately Agamemnon became available and was selected instead.She was modified at Chatham Dockyard for use as a target ship between 6 December 1920 and 8 April 1921. The ship was rewired for radio control and stripped; the 12-inch turrets remained aboard, but all of her guns and their equipment were removed, as were her torpedo equipment, flying deck, sea cabins, main <b>derrick</b> and <b>boat</b> equipment, lower conning tower, masts and yards, most of her crew amenities, and other unnecessary equipment.

5|$|Leipzig {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Reichsmarinewerft {{shipyard}} in Wilhelmshaven on 28 April 1928 and launched on 18 October 1929. She was commissioned into the Reichsmarine on 8 October 1931. The ship trained extensively in the Baltic Sea throughout 1932 and 1933, and also made several goodwill cruises overseas. In 1934, she and the cruiser Königsberg made the first goodwill visit to the United Kingdom {{since the end of}} World War I. In late 1934, Leipzig went into drydock for modifications. An aircraft catapult was installed on the aft superstructure and a crane for handling float planes replaced one of her <b>boat</b> <b>derricks.</b> The original single-mount 8.8cm anti-aircraft guns were replaced with twin mounts. These modifications were made in Kiel. In early 1935, Leipzig joined the old pre-dreadnought battleship , the new heavy cruiser Deutschland, and the light cruiser Köln for major fleet exercises.|$|R
