5|$|Eaton's pintail has two subspecies, A. e. eatoni (the Kerguelen pintail) of Kerguelen <b>Islands,</b> <b>and</b> A. e. drygalskyi (the Crozet pintail) of Crozet <b>Islands,</b> <b>and</b> was {{formerly}} considered conspecific {{with the northern}} hemisphere's northern pintail. Sexual dimorphism is much less marked in the southern pintails, with the male's breeding appearance being similar to the female plumage. Unusually for a species with such a large range, northern pintail has no geographical subspecies if Eaton's pintail is treated as a separate species. A claimed extinct subspecies from Manra Island, Tristram's pintail, A. a. modesta, appears to be indistinguishable from the nominate form.|$|E
