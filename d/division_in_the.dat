5|$|On 17 October 1942, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin cabled British Prime Minister Winston Churchill {{to request}} that the 9th Division be {{returned}} to Australia. In the cable Curtin stated that, owing to Australia's manpower shortage {{and the demands of}} the war in the Pacific, it was no longer possible to provide enough reinforcements to sustain the <b>division</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East. The British Government initially resisted this request {{on the grounds that the}} 9th Division was required for the upcoming offensive at El Alamein. On 29 October (six days into the battle) Curtin again cabled Churchill, stating that Australia needed the <b>division</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific and in a fit state to participate in offensive operations. On 1 November, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote to Curtin proposing to send another US Army division to Australia if the Australian Government agreed to retain the 9th <b>Division</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle East. Curtin, acting on the advice of MacArthur, responded to Roosevelt on 16 November rejecting this suggestion, and again requested that the 9th Division be returned.|$|E
