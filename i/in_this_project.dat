5|$|From 1915 Gaudí devoted himself almost {{exclusively}} to his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família, a synthesis of his architectural evolution. After completion of the crypt and the apse, still in Gothic style, {{the rest of the}} church is conceived in an organic style, imitating natural shapes with their abundance of ruled surfaces. He intended the interior to resemble a forest, with inclined columns like branching trees, helicoidal in form, creating a simple but sturdy structure. Gaudí applied all of his previous experimental findings <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>project,</b> from works such as the Park Güell and the crypt of the Colònia Güell, creating a church that is at once structurally perfect, harmonious and aesthetically satisfying.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of Kanon, the Key staff started production on Air and expanded {{the number of people}} involved <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>project</b> compared to Kanon. The executive producer for Air was Takahiro Baba from VisualArt's, the publishing company that Key is under. The planning for Air was headed by Jun Maeda who was also one of two main scenario writers, the other being Takashi Ishikawa. Scenario assistance was provided by four more people: Kazuki Fujii, Kai, Tōya Okano, and Yūichi Suzumoto. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Miracle Mikipon, Na-Ga, and Shinory—and background art was provided by Din and Torino. The music in the game was composed primarily by Shinji Orito, Jun Maeda, and Magome Togoshi, who had started working with Key since before Kanons release. After {{the completion}} of Air, two of the staff—Kazuki Fujii, and Takashi Ishikawa—left Key.|$|E
