50|$|This can be {{a hazard}} to animals like seagulls and turtles because when placed in large bodies of water like oceans, the toxins of the {{cigarette}} butt can be detrimental to marine life. Researchers at San Diego State University claim that <b>filter-tipped</b> <b>cigarette</b> butts are toxic especially for marine and fresh-water fish. Even just one cigarette butt alone soaking in water for a day is hazardous enough to kill 50% of fish in a litre of water. Dolphins have the most blubber in the marine life and toxins concentrate there, thus dolphins especially are the most affected by the toxins.|$|E
40|$|Background: Age-old {{practice}} "using tobacco" is a {{well known}} major global concern as it victimizes all its lovers {{by a host of}} chronic noncommunicable diseases including cancer; all develop very slowly and silently, and can cause premature death. Objectives: To assess the pattern of tobacco use among the medical and nonmedical college students. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out in Kolkata collecting anonymous data from 515 medical and 349 nonmedical college students of two medical and two general colleges, selected randomly. Result: Overall prevalence of tobacco use (18. 3 % vs 43. 6 %) and smoking (14. 9 % vs 40. 7 %) were significantly less in medical subjects, both across the sex and years of study. Lower rate of tobacco adoption at college level, higher quitting rate, correct knowledge regarding uselessness of filter attached with cigarette, and ill-effects of tobacco consumption were observed among medical participants. More nonmedical subjects were increasingly smoking compared to medical students. <b>Filter-tipped</b> <b>cigarette</b> was the top choice, and smoking was more prevalent mode of use among the nonmedical participants, most (62. 3 %) of whom were mild users. Curiosity was the top influencing factor for the initiation of tobacco use and two-third users wanted to quit. Conclusion: Although the mortal habits was comparatively less among medical students, the medical environment seemed to fail to curb the dreadful practice totally. Thereby it can be recommended that active behavior-changing communication is required for all sections of the society to tear out the social root of the problem instead of unimpressive vague health warnings in vogue...|$|E
40|$|Background: Environmental {{tobacco smoke}} (ETS) is {{associated}} with human morbidity and mortality, particularly {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD and lung cancer. Although direct DNA-damage is a leading pathomechanism in active smokers, passive smoking is enough to induce bronchial asthma, especially in children. Particulate matter (PM) demonstrably {{plays an important role in}} this ETS-associated human morbidity, constituting a surrogate parameter for ETS exposure. Methods: Using an Automatic Environmental Tobacco Smoke Emitter (AETSE) and an in-house developed, non-standard smoking regime, we tried to imitate the smoking process of human smokers to demonstrate the significance of passive smoking. Mean concentration (Cmean) and area under the curve (AUC) of particulate matter (PM 2. 5) emitted by 3 R 4 F reference cigarettes and the popular filter-tipped and non-filter brand cigarettes “Roth-Händle” were measured and compared. The cigarettes were not conditioned prior to smoking. The measurements were tested for Gaussian distribution and significant differences. Results: Cmean PM 2. 5 of the 3 R 4 F reference cigarette: 3911 µg/m 3; of the filter-tipped Roth-Händle: 3831 µg/m 3; and of the non-filter Roth-Händle: 2053 µg/m 3. AUC PM 2. 5 of the 3 R 4 F reference cigarette: 1, 647, 006 µg/m 3 ·s; of the filter-tipped Roth-Händle: 1, 608, 000 µg/m 3 ·s; and of the non-filter Roth-Händle: 858, 891 µg/m 3 ·s. Conclusion: The <b>filter-tipped</b> <b>cigarettes</b> (the 3 R 4 F reference <b>cigarette</b> and <b>filter-tipped</b> Roth-Händle) emitted significantly more PM 2. 5 than the non-filter Roth-Händle. Considering the harmful potential of PM, our findings note that the <b>filter-tipped</b> <b>cigarettes</b> are not a less harmful alternative for passive smokers. Tobacco taxation should be reconsidered and non-smoking legislation enforced...|$|R
50|$|Salem is a {{brand of}} {{cigarettes}} introduced in 1956 by the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company as the first <b>filter-tipped</b> menthol <b>cigarette.</b> Its name (along {{with that of the}} Winston brand) derives from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the city where RJR was founded and headquartered. Salem cigarettes are unique in that they are blended with Asian Menthol rather than the traditional mainstream Menthol. It is owned and marketed by ITG Brands LLC. (a subsidiary of Imperial Tobacco Company) inside the U.S. and by Japan Tobacco outside the U.S.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In the UK, the {{flammability}} {{of domestic}} upholstered furniture is regulated by a cigarette composite test and flame ignition tests for components. In the USA, cigarettes of reduced ignition power {{have been suggested}} {{as a means of}} complementing the voluntary UFAC Code for cigarette resistant seating. This type of cigarette may be defined by the NIST mock-up and cigarette smouldering propensity tests that were developed from empirical correlations with seating tests. The NIST tests have been criticised by the Cigarette Ignition Propensity Joint Venture, (CIPJV, see note) which examined the effect of variations of con-ditions and materials on results. Part 1 of this paper deals with the determination of the ignition power of se-lected commercial cigarettes that included popular and slender <b>filter-tipped</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and the untipped cigarettes used for standard tests. Part 2 deals with the cigarette testing of seating, Part 3 with mattresses, Part 4 with bed assem-blies, and Part 5 assesses the role of cigarettes of reduced ignition power in re-ducing the fire risks of upholstery composites. Note: The Cigarette Ignition Propensity Joint Venture was set up in 1990 by the six (U. S.) domestic cigarette manufacturers to conduct joint research toward the development of a valid and reliable standard method for measuring cigarette smouldering propensity and to ensure that the test provided a reasonable, accurate prediction of real-world fire risk...|$|R
40|$|Blood {{nicotine}} and carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) {{concentrations were}} studied in 330 smokers (206 women and 124 men). Blood nicotine concentrations in individual smokers varied from 25 to 444 nmol/l (4 to 72 ng/ml). The average concentration, 203 nmol/l (33 ng/ml), {{was the same}} in the men and the women, although cigarette consumption was higher in the men. Despite large differences in nicotine yield, there was no relation between blood nicotine concentration and the type of cigarette smoked: smokers of plain, untipped cigarettes (1. 9 mg nicotine), cigarettes with unventilated filters (1. 3 mg nicotine), and cigarettes with ventilated filters (0. 8 mg nicotine) had similar blood nicotine concentrations. Cigarette consumption was also similar in these three groups. The correlation between blood nicotine concentration and nicotine yield of cigarette, though significant, was low (0. 21, p < 0. 001), showing that the nicotine yield of the cigarettes accounted for only 4. 4 % of the variation in blood nicotine concentrations. Similarly, the low correlation of 0. 30 between COHb concentration and cigarette consumption suggests that cigarette consumption accounted for only 9 % of the variation in the amount of smoke taken into the smokers' lungs. These results suggest that the assumed health advantage of switching to lower-tar and lower-nicotine cigarettes may be largely offset by the tendency of smokers to compensate by increasing inhalation. The findings of epidemiological studies showing lower risks with <b>filter-tipped</b> <b>cigarettes</b> may be attributable to other factors such as biases in the samples and changes in the quality and carcinogenicity of tobacco tar, rather than to reduced tar intake...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} popular {{perceptions of}} tobacco products and describes patterns of use among college youth in Karnataka, India. Data {{are drawn from}} 25 key informant interviews and six focus groups with male and female college students, interviews with shopkeepers, observational data on youth tobacco consumption, and a college-based survey. The survey was administered to 1587 males attending eleven colleges. Forty-five percent (n= 716) of college students surveyed had used tobacco products. Thirty-six percent (n= 573) had tried cigarettes, 10 % (n= 157) had tried bidis, and 18 % (n= 290) had tried gutkha. Tobacco consumption among smokers was low; for daily smokers, {{the mean number of}} cigarettes smoked was 6 per day. Students attending professional colleges, including engineering, medicine, and law {{were significantly more likely to}} have ever smoked and to be daily smokers when compared to students enrolled in other courses of study. In interviews, male students noted that smoking a cigarette enhanced one's manliness, relieved boredom, and eased tension. Although female students interviewed were non-smokers, several suggested that in the future, smoking might be an acceptable behavior among college-going females. When asked about their perceptions of smoking among youth in Western countries, the majority of students believed that three-quarters of male and female youth in the West smoked. This perception has been largely formed through media images, including satellite television and films. With regard to addiction, it was widely believed that <b>filter-tipped</b> <b>cigarettes</b> were one of the most addictive products because they are made of better quality tobacco, and are milder and smoother to smoke. Therefore, a person could easily smoke more of them, which would lead to addiction. Another widely held belief was that the more expensive the cigarette, the less harmful it was for one's health.

40|$|Suspension of {{adenovirus}} type 5 in 2. 0 ml of {{cell culture}} fluid at 37 degrees C {{were subjected to}} smoke from four cigarettes over a 4 -h period. The cigarettes were smoked in a normal manner, and the inhaled smoke was exhaled through glass tubing into the virus-containing fluid. The virus suspensions were then titrated, using monolayer cultures of HEp- 2 cells. Smoke from <b>filter-tipped</b> or regular <b>cigarettes</b> caused a 2 - to 3 -log drop in titer of tissue culture infectious doses of adenovirus type 5 per 0. 1 ml of virus suspension. No reductions in titers were observed with parallel suspensions of the virus subjected to normal inhaled and exhaled air...|$|R
