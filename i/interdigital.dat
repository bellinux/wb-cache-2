5|$|The comb-line filter {{is similar}} to the <b>interdigital</b> filter in that it lends itself to {{mechanical}} assembly in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and the design is consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide, that is, free of spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest.|$|E
5|$|Early {{stripline}} directly coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was reduced and the compactness successively increased {{with the introduction}} of parallel-coupled line filters, <b>interdigital</b> filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is a {{medium-sized}} oryzomyine with small ears and large feet, and {{is similar to}} the marsh rice rat in general appearance. The long and coarse fur is brownish above and ochraceous below. At the base of the tail, the upper and lower sides differ in color and at the end is a short tuft of hairs. The scales on the tail are well-developed. As in other Oryzomys, the hindfeet exhibit specializations for life in the water. The plantar (lower) surface of the metatarsus is naked. Two of the pads are very small. Ungual tufts, tufts of hair at the bases of the claws, are poorly developed. <b>Interdigital</b> webbing is present, but extends along {{less than half of the}} first phalanges.|$|E
5|$|<b>Interdigital</b> {{filters are}} {{another form of}} coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, {{the advantage of a}} mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and Q values as low as 1.4 are possible.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys {{contains}} medium-sized, semiaquatically specialized oryzomyine rodents. They have long, coarse fur that is grayish to reddish on the upperparts {{and white}} to buff on the underparts. The marsh rice rat superficially resembles the introduced species black rat and brown rat, but has larger differences in color between the upper- and underparts. The vibrissae (whiskers) are short and the ears {{are small and}} well-haired. The tail is usually as long as or longer than the head and body and is sparsely haired, but the hairs on the lower side are longer than those above. Females have eight mammae, as in most oryzomyines. The hindfeet are broad and have the first and fifth digits notably shorter than the middle three. The upper surface is hairy, but the underside is naked and covered with small irregularities (squamae). The pads are generally poorly developed, as are the ungual tufts. <b>Interdigital</b> webbing may be present, but its development is variable within the genus.|$|E
5|$|The only {{species in}} the genus Pseudoryzomys, its closest living {{relatives}} are the large rats Holochilus and Lundomys, which are semiaquatic, spending {{much of their time}} in the water. The three genera share several characters, including specializations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle, such as the presence of membranes between the digits (<b>interdigital</b> webbing), and a reduction in the complexity of the molar crowns, both of which are at incipient stages in Pseudoryzomys. Together, they form a unique assemblage within the oryzomyine tribe, a very diverse group including over one hundred species, mainly in South America. This tribe is part of the subfamily Sigmodontinae and family Cricetidae, which include many more species, mainly from Eurasia and the Americas. Pseudoryzomys simplex was independently described in 1887 on the basis of subfossil cave specimens from Brazil (as Hesperomys simplex); and in 1921 {{on the basis of a}} live specimen from Paraguay (as Oryzomys wavrini). This was confirmed in 1991 that both names pertained to the same species.|$|E
5|$|Within Oryzomyini, a 2006 phylogenetic {{analysis}} by Marcelo Weksler which used both morphological and DNA sequence data found {{some evidence that}} Oryzomys is most closely related to a group including Holochilus, Lundomys, and Pseudoryzomys. Although analyses based on morphological and combined data supported this relationship, sequences of the Rbp3 gene alone instead placed Oryzomys among a group that included Nectomys, Sigmodontomys, {{and a few other}} genera. In all analyses, Oryzomys appeared within clade D of Oryzomyini. The relationship between Oryzomys and the Holochilus group was supported by five synapomorphies (shared derived characters)—absence or reduction of both the hypothenar and <b>interdigital</b> pads; reduction of ungual tufts of hairs surrounding the claws; having the back margin of the zygomatic plate of the skull at the same level as the front of the first upper molar; and the anterocone (front cusp) of the first upper molar divided by an anteromedian fossette. The first three are adaptations to the semiaquatic lifestyle that Oryzomys {{and the members of the}} Holochilus group share, and may thus be examples of convergent evolution.|$|E

25|$|Deer {{have seven}} major {{external}} scent glands, distributed throughout their bodies. These glands are the forehead glands (located on the forehead), the preorbital glands (located below the eyes), the nasal glands (located inside the nostrils), the <b>interdigital</b> glands (located between the toes), the preputial gland (located inside the foreskin of the deer's penis), the metatarsal glands (located {{outside of the}} hind legs), and the tarsal glands (located inside of the hind legs). Though it is not their primary function, the salivary glands also function as scent glands. Deer rely heavily on these scent glands to communicate {{with other members of}} their species, and possibly even with members of other species. A deer may rub its preorbital gland (e.g., on a branch) purely for pleasure.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, under {{different}} titles, inventors conceived electro optical effects as alternatives to twisted nematic field effect LCDs (TN- and STN- LCDs). One approach {{was to use}} <b>interdigital</b> electrodes on one glass substrate only to produce an electric field essentially parallel to the glass substrates. To {{take full advantage of}} the properties of this In Plane Switching (IPS) technology further work was needed. After thorough analysis, details of advantageous embodiments are filed in Germany by Guenter Baur et al. and patented in various countries. which is not 0 or 90 degrees, filed Jan 9, 1990. The Fraunhofer Institute in Freiburg, where the inventors worked, assigns these patents to Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, a supplier of LC substances. In 1992, shortly thereafter, engineers at Hitachi work out various practical details of the IPS technology to interconnect the thin-film transistor array as a matrix and to avoid undesirable stray fields in between pixels. Hitachi also improves the viewing angle dependence further by optimizing the shape of the electrodes (Super IPS). NEC and Hitachi become early manufacturers of active-matrix addressed LCDs based on the IPS technology. This is a milestone for implementing large-screen LCDs having acceptable visual performance for flat-panel computer monitors and television screens. In 1996, Samsung developed the optical patterning technique that enables multi-domain LCD. Multi-domain and In Plane Switching subsequently remain the dominant LCD designs through 2006. In 2007 the image quality of LCD televisions surpassed the image quality of cathode-ray-tube-based (CRT) TVs. In the fourth quarter of 2007, LCD televisions surpassed CRT TVs in worldwide sales for the first time. LCD TVs were projected to account 50% of the 200million TVs to be shipped globally in 2006, according to Displaybank. In October 2011, Toshiba announced 2560×1600 pixels on a 6.1-inch (155mm) LCD panel, suitable for use in a tablet computer, especially for Chinese character display.|$|E

500|$|Males often adopt lekking as a {{strategy}} {{on the part of}} males to garner females for mating. Territories are established by males {{on the basis of the}} local distribution of female groups, which in turn is determined by the habitat, so as to ensure greater access to females. The males actively defend resources in their territories, nearly [...] in size; territories are marked with scent (using preorbital gland and <b>interdigital</b> gland secretions, faeces and urine) While other males are not allowed into these territories, females are allowed to visit these places to forage. The male can attempt mating with visiting females. Lekking is a demanding strategy, as the males often have to bear injuries [...] thus it is a tactic typically adopted by strong, dominant males. Males may either defend their mates or try to forcibly copulate with them. Weaker males, who may not be dominant, might choose the second method.|$|E
500|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus is a {{medium-sized}} rice rat, smaller than O.couesi, with thick, glossy fur and velvety underfur. The {{hairs on the}} back are about 6mm in length.

500|$|Merriam divided his palustris-mexicanus {{group in}} two [...] "series" [...] {{according}} {{to the color of}} the underparts (white or [...] ). Goldman divided his palustris group in two [...] "sections"—a couesi section with O.couesi and six related species, and a palustris section with O.palustris only. He noted that the latter differed from the former in the generally darker, more brownish, longer fur, and larger sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the mesopterygoid fossa, the gap behind the end of the palate). As Weksler's 2006 analysis included only O.couesi and the marsh rice rat among species of Oryzomys in the strict sense, he could not test those groups. Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales concurred with Goldman's division, listing additional characters, and noted that the palustris group may be more semiaquatically adapted than the members of the couesi group are. In the latter, the fur is usually reddish-brown, as opposed to grayish-brown in the palustris group. Members of the couesi group have smaller sphenopalatine vacuities and a smaller sphenopalatine foramen, a foramen (opening) {{in the side of the}} skull above the molars, and a more highly developed anterolabial cingulum on the third lower molar (a crest at the front of the tooth). The hypothenar pad of the hindfoot, located on the sole far from the fingers, is present in the couesi group, but absent in the palustris group. <b>Interdigital</b> webbing may be more highly developed in the palustris group. Using morphological data, Voss and Weksler found a closer relationship between O.couesi and O.gorgasi to the exclusion of O.palustris, but with low confidence. The DNA sequence data of Hanson and colleagues supported a deep separation between the palustris and couesi groups, but a Costa Rican sample (assigned to O.couesi) was about as distant from the two groups as they were from each other.|$|E
2500|$|Athlete's foot {{is divided}} into four {{categories}} or presentations: chronic <b>interdigital</b> athlete's foot, plantar (chronic scaly) athlete's foot (aka [...] "moccasin foot"), acute ulcerative tinea pedis, and vesiculobullous athlete's foot. [...] "Interdigital" [...] means between the toes. [...] "Plantar" [...] here refers to the sole of the foot. The ulcerative condition includes macerated lesions with scaly borders. Maceration is the softening and breaking down of skin due to extensive exposure to moisture. [...] A vesiculobullous disease {{is a type of}} mucocutaneous disease characterized by vesicles and bullae (blisters). Both vesicles and bullae are fluid-filled lesions, and they are distinguished by size (vesicles being less than 5–10mm and bulla being larger than 5–10mm, depending upon what definition is used).|$|E
2500|$|Cattle have a {{range of}} odiferous glands over their body {{including}} <b>interdigital,</b> infraorbital, [...] and sebaceous glands, indicating that olfaction probably plays a large role in their social life. [...] Both the primary olfactory system using the olfactory bulbs, and the secondary olfactory system using the vomeronasal organ are used. [...] This latter olfactory system is used in the flehmen response. [...] There is evidence that when cattle are stressed, this can be recognised by other cattle and this is communicated by alarm substances in the urine. [...] The odour of dog faeces induces behavioural changes prior to cattle feeding, whereas the odours of urine from either stressed or non-stressed conspecifics and blood have no effect.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{knock-outs}} {{have been}} made in the apoptosis pathways to test the function of each of the proteins. [...] Several caspases, in addition to APAF-1 and FADD, have been mutated to determine the new phenotype. [...] In order to create a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) knockout, an exon containing the nucleotides 3704–5364 was removed from the gene. [...] This exon encodes a portion of the mature TNF domain, as well as the leader sequence, which is a highly conserved region necessary for proper intracellular processing. [...] TNF-/- mice develop normally and have no gross structural or morphological abnormalities. [...] However, upon immunization with SRBC (sheep red blood cells), these mice demonstrated a deficiency in the maturation of an antibody response; they were able to generate normal levels of IgM, but could not develop specific IgG levels. [...] Apaf-1 is the protein that turns on caspase 9 by cleavage to begin the caspase cascade that leads to apoptosis. [...] Since a -/- mutation in the APAF-1 gene is embryonic lethal, a gene trap strategy was used in order to generate an APAF-1 -/- mouse. [...] This assay is used to disrupt gene function by creating an intragenic gene fusion. [...] When an APAF-1 gene trap is introduced into cells, many morphological changes occur, such as spina bifida, the persistence of <b>interdigital</b> webs, and open brain. [...] In addition, after embryonic day 12.5, the brain of the embryos showed several structural changes. [...] APAF-1 cells are protected from apoptosis stimuli such as irradiation. [...] A BAX-1 knock-out mouse exhibits normal forebrain formation and a decreased programmed cell death in some neuronal populations and in the spinal cord, leading to an increase in motor neurons.|$|E
