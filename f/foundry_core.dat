Thanks to hydrophilic properties of hardened or even overheated binder, possible is application of effective methods of hydrous reclamation consisting in its secondary hydration. For the same reason (hydrophilia of the binder), moulds and <b>foundry</b> <b>cores</b> made of high-silica moulding sands with sodium silicate are susceptible to the action of components of atmospheric air, including the contained steam. This paper presents results of a research on the effect of (relative) humidity on mechanical and technological properties of microwave-hardened moulding mixtures. Specimens of the moulding sand containing 1. 5 wt% of sodium water-glass with module 2. 5 were subjected, in a laboratory climatic chamber, to long-term action of steam contained in the chamber atmosphere. Concentration of water in atmospheric air was stabilized for 28 days (672 h) according to the relative humidity parameter that was ca. 40 %, 60 % and 80 % at constant temperature 20 °C. In three cycles of the examinations, the specimens were taken out from the chamber every 7 days (168 h) and their mechanical and technological parameters were determined. It was found on the grounds of laboratory measurements that moulds and cores hardened with microwaves are susceptible to action of atmospheric air and presence of water (as steam) intensifies action of the air components on glassy film of sodium silicate. Microwave-hardened moulding sands containing sodium silicate may be stored on a long-term basis in strictly determined atmospheric conditions only, at reduced humidity. In spite of a negative effect of steam contained in the air, the examined moulding mixtures maintain a part of their mechanical and technological properties, so the moulds and <b>foundry</b> <b>cores</b> stored in specified, controlled conditions could be still used in manufacture...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. (Metallurgy) Abstract: In {{the last}} decade, {{the growing demand}} for {{ecological}} and economical casting processes {{has led to the}} promotion and continuous interest in the non-toxic and cheap, inorganic binders in <b>foundry</b> <b>core</b> making and moulding processes. The new generation inorganic binders usually come in two parts, part one is the binder and part two is a breakdown agent. There is a knowledge gap on the strength development and residual strength of the one component new generation inorganic binders in South Africa. The relationship of performance and residual strength is also unknown with local silica sands from different geological origins in South Africa. The foundrymen have limited knowledge on the strength development and residual strength that can be obtained from new generation single component inorganic binders. This study provides information to foundries and binder manufacturers on strength development and residual strength of single component inorganic binder systems with different local sands. The methodology of the study was achieved through experimental work in the laboratory and a casting trial in a local foundry. The laboratory experiments involved characterisation of the silica sands, strength development and residual strength testing of the binder with different sands and curing processes. The findings of the study did show that the different sand sources show different strength development and residual strength. The new generation single component inorganic binders can achieve good strength development when using a sand with good physical and chemical characteristics. The no bake ester cured achieved a highest strength of 280 N/cm 2 after 24 hours. The carbon dioxide cured achieved a highest strength of 164 N/cm 2 after 24 hours with minimal gassing time. The heat cured achieved a highest strength of 419 N/cm 2. The results indicate good strength development. High temperature residual strength of these binders is relatively low ranging from 0 - 31 N/cm 2 depending on the curing method and silica sand source. The information from this study will be important for foundries to make informative core making and moulding decisions...|$|E

40|$|This works {{presents}} the results of studies concerning possibility of application of microwave heating in the curing process of molding sands containing oil binders. Molding sands prepared with three kinds of binders, that is oils C, DL and Retanol, have been subject to experiments. The sands have been dried with two methods: in a microwave chamber of 750 W power and, for comparison, with classical method at the temperature of 200 °C for 120 minutes. Tensile and bending strength of the samples have been determined after cooling down. It has been found that microwave drying in the low-power device used for experiments is effective only in case of molding sand prepared with addition of DL binder. The temperature of heated, even up to 32 minutes in a microwave chamber, blocks prepared from the remaining two masses, was insufficient to initiate binding process. The undertaken attempts of binder modification and introduction of additives intensifying microwave heating process allowed for achievement of satisfactory results. It has been found that power of the heating device is the main factor determining efficiency of microwave curing of molding sands containing oil binders. An additional experiment has been conducted on a laboratory workstation allowing for microwave heating of small mass samples with a high output power of magnetron concentrated in a small substrate volume. It has been observed that microwave drying process of molding sands was of dynamic character over a short period of time, not exceeding 120 seconds, thus assuring efficient curing of the sands containing the used oil binders. Therefore, application of devices of properly high microwave output power allows for efficient drying of oil molding sands, while simultaneously assuring the possibility to reduce time and energy consumption necessary for production of <b>foundry</b> <b>cores</b> of proper functional characteristics...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out in a steel foundry in Brisbane to {{evaluate}} the nature and frequency of respiratory symptoms and to assess ventilatory function. The foundry used many moulding processes including the Furane, Isocure, Shell, carbon dioxide, and oil sand systems. Nasal symptoms and wheeze were often reported, particularly by workers in the general <b>foundry</b> and <b>core</b> shop, and on a semiautomated line. By contrast, workers in the aftercast section not exposed to fumes or vapours from the various moulding processes reported these symptoms less often. Of 46 workers exposed to moulding fumes and vapours, 11 had developed a wheeze while working at the foundry. Wheeze and other respiratory tract symptoms were often attributed by the workers to exposure to substances at work, particularly from the Shell process which uses phenol formaldehyde resin and hexamethylenetetramine. Symptoms were reported also, but less often, on exposure to materials used in the Furane process (urea formaldehyde and furfuryl alcohol) and the Isocure process (methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, phenol formaldehyde, and dimethylethylamine). Ventilatory function studied over Monday and Friday showed a small and inconsistent changes. The six subjects working on the semiautomated line showed a small decrease in FEV 1 (+/- SEM) (208 +/- 70 ml) only on Monday; this differed significantly from that in 17 aftercast workers (9 +/- 50 ml, p less than 0. 05). Ventilatory function recorded before work on Monday morning showed no evidence of chronic airway obstruction in any group. Most environmental measurements were below the threshold limit values (TLV) except in the general foundry, where furfuryl alcohol was detected at concentrations of up to 50 ppm and formaldehyde at 4 ppm.
