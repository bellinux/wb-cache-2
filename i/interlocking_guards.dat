40|$|Rubber {{is one of}} the {{important}} commodities in the world. Globally, workers are facing so many problems of hazards that produce by rubber process. In Indonesia, there are several data of occupational problems such as respiratory diseases, muscle and skeletal diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, diseases of the teeth and oral cavity, skin diseases and skin tissue. In Iranian rubber factory, Iran, workers had suffered from some kind of musculoskeletal symptoms. Stomach and liver cancers in workers are having in Shanghai tire factory. In addition, Germany has cancer problem of their workers who work in rubber factory. Most of the rubber process in the factory can cause some hazards of the workers. In unloading area and area that operator is taking the dirt manually, workers are facing ergonomic problems. The possible control is reduce weight of load, team lift the object with two or more workers and Use mechanical assist. Machine safeguarding is essential for protecting from Cutting process that can make workers amputation organs such as hands, and fingers. In bale process, the workers need to cut raw rubber into bale in bale cutting. Furthermore, workers are facing with amputation problem. To manage that, It must be designed as a standard which has <b>interlocking</b> <b>guards</b> to prevent access to the cutting area. When wrapped using plastic, workers use a heated iron and sticked in plastic so that it blends neatly. The risks are fingers can cut accidently and then the workers also get contamination from polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The possible preventions are use an automatic plastic wrapping machine with palletized product sitting on a turntable and respirator. Another problem is contact dermatitis that has been reported frequently among rubber workers. The prevention for that problem is using Gloves. The aim of researcher is to provide the profile of occupational injuries and illnesses, potential hazards in rubber factory to prevent the workers...|$|E
40|$|Apps repackaged through reverse {{engineering}} pose a significant security {{threat to the}} Android smart phone ecosystem. Previous solutions have mostly focused on the detection and identification of repackaged apps. Nevertheless, current app anti-repackaging services can only protect applications at a coarse level and have significant performance overhead. These approaches can neither meet the performance requirements of Android nor achieve fine-grained protection against cumulative attack at the same time. Specifically, these solutions rely on a fix-structure detecting engine and then will execute the same path at different times, which lead to the whole protection performs poorly when faced with dynamic cumulative attack, which is typical in real-world attack. This paper introduces the AppIS, a reinforced antirepackaging immune system, that is robust to app-repackaging attack scenarios. Unlike past work, which mostly focuses on simple protection only from just one respect, our design exploits an <b>interlocking</b> <b>guarding</b> net with time diversity for the tamperproofing of Android applications. The intuition underlying our design is that a dynamic and static combining method can provide a multi-level protection for the codes, core algorithm and sensitive data. We analyze and classify the existing threats on Android platform and furthermore abstract then model the repackaging attack scenarios. We then adapt a random controller used by the dispatcher to randomly construct guarding net with different structure every time. We have built a prototype of our design using Java Native Interface cross-layer calling mechanism for performance requirement. Results from a deployment of AppIS on three kinds of popular apps demonstrate that the new design can prevent our apps from cumulative attack without extra performance cost...|$|R
40|$|HeerHugo is a propositional formula checker 1, {{that determines}} whether a given formula is satisfiable or not. Its {{name comes from}} the dutch railway station Heerhugowaard, as it was {{developed}} to validate correct operation of the Vital Processor <b>Interlocking</b> unit <b>guarding</b> the safety of all railway traffic at this station. We describe how HeerHugo attempts to prove or disprove formulas, and we end with some theoretical considerations regarding the (lack of) progress {{in the area of}} automatic theorem proving. 1 Introduction In 1994 we 2 contacted the Dutch Railway Company (Nederlandse Spoorwegen) in order to find test beds in which the theory we had developed could be applied. We ran into the problem of checking correctness properties of Vital Processor Interlockings that are being used to guard safety at smaller Dutch railway yards [10, 11]. After some preprocessing, the question could be reduced to checking whether large propositional formulas (120 K) were satisfiable. In order to [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new 12 T loadless SRAM cell that {{exhibits}} soft error resilience characteristics. The proposed cell {{is based on an}} <b>interlocked</b> structure with <b>guard</b> gates that provides an × 80 increase in soft error resilience compared to a typical unprotected 6 T SRAM cell, while addressing the static power consumption issue of modern CMOS technologies. At a 90 nm technology, simulations show that the investigated 12 T SRAM cell draws 3 times less leakage current than a DICE cell of similarly sized transistors and 20 % less than a typical 6 T cell. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Florida International University's (FIU) Hemispheric Center for Environmental Technology (HCET) {{evaluated}} five saws {{for their}} effectiveness in cutting up specially prepared fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. These crates were built as surrogates for crates that presently hold radioactive contaminated glove boxes at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos facility. The Adamant circular saw was assessed on August 14, 2001. During the FIU test of efficacy, {{a team from}} the Operating Engineers National Hazmat Program (OENHP) evaluated {{the occupational safety and}} health issues associated with this technology. The Adamant was only used during a limited ''test'' on a regular plywood crate due to safety considerations of the tool for this application. The Adamant circular saw, a counter-rotating twin-cutter, constructed with blades that work differently than conventional cutting wheels with twin blades, each rotating in opposite directions. It is used to cut wood and metals. Each blade is approximately 8 3 / 4 inches in diameter with a maximum cutting depth of 2 1 / 2 inches. The machine has two rotation speeds: 1, 900 and 2, 900 rotations per minute (rpm). The saw is operated with an <b>interlocked,</b> <b>guarded</b> trigger switch located at the end of the saw opposite the cutting blades. To operate the saw, the safety interlock must be depressed prior to powering the saw with the trigger control. The saw is supported by a handle at the front of the saw near the cutting blades. The top part of the blades is guarded near the handle, with approximately three-fourths of the face of the blades exposed. The Adamant circular saw is an innovative technology used to cut metals and wood. Its safety features include: interlocking switch for powering the saw, overload indicator and shutoff, and an electronic brake that stops the engine immediately when the start button is released. The top part of the blades is guarded near the motor. With approximately three-fourths of the face of the blades open, the operator is exposed to the potential risk of serious and minor cuts and abrasions when using and handling the saw. There is also potential for damage to the blades if the saw is not stored properly. Without guarding on the lower part of the blades, these can be damaged if the saw is dropped or rested on the cutting blades. Based upon the industrial hygiene sampling conducted for the other four saws demonstrated at FIU, noise levels, nuisance dust, and airborne fiberglass may be a problem when using this technology for the cutting of fiberglass-reinforced plywood crates. No industrial hygiene sampling was conducted while the Adamant saw was in use. Engineering controls should be used to eliminate these problems whenever possible. Where this is not possible, administrative controls, training, and proper personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used. Respirators should be used if engineering controls do not sufficiently control the dust or fiberglass generated. Respirators should be equipped with an organic vapor and acid gas cartridge with High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, since during the demonstration, the workers complained of an odd smell, which may have been the breakdown of the fiberglass...|$|R
40|$|The Szent István Király Museum of Székesfehérvár {{bought the}} cuirass, {{which had been}} found in the Danube near Pilismarót, from a private {{collector}} in 1982. The breast and back plates of the cuirass were built of bronze plates. The complete cuirass is a unique item and it belongs to the group of cuirasses found in the Danube region [Èaka (Cseke), Ducové (Ducó), Èierna nad Tisou (Ágcsernyő), Nadap, Pázmándfalu]. An intact armour was found in grave 12 of Dendra in the Aegean, which was composed of a high, separate neck <b>guard,</b> <b>interlocked</b> plates and a coat-of-chain built of two parts underneath. Two fragmentary cuirasses of the same type are known from the settlement of Thebes. They are dated from the LH II-III A 2 /B 1 period. The shape of the cuirass from the Danube and its high neck guard are similar to the miniature bronze cuirass, worn as a pendant, from the hoard find of Brandgraben (Steiermark) dated from Bz D-Ha A 1 and the bipartite cuirass found in the Seine at Saint-Germain-du-Plain. On this cuirass from the Danube, flat rivets hold the two plates together on both sides. Similar, although conical rivets were used in the cuirasses from Èierna nad Tisou and Saint-Germain-du-Plain. A motive of semicircular, punched dots can be seen {{on the bottom of the}} back plate of the cuirass from the Danube. This and the solution of the shoulder strap on the right shoulder show similarity to the cuirass from Saint-Germain-du-Plain. The finely punched dot row (“Gleich-Buckel-System”) and the plastic rib are characteristic decorations of the cuirasses of the Danube region. The cuirass from the Danube cannot exactly be dated in lack of accompanying finds nevertheless the listed characteristic suggest that it came from the Bz D-Ha A 1 period...|$|R
