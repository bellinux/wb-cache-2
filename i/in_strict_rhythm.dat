First one, then two, then three, then four figures, dancers or mime artistes, dressed in coloured djellabas (white, yellow, blue and red) appear one after another to scurry along the sides and across the diagonals of a square, shuffling <b>in</b> <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm</b> to a rapid percussion beat. Each figure then departs in the order in which he appeared, leaving another to recommence the sequence … Strikingly all of them avoid the centre which is clearly visible {{in the middle of the}} square." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1946, {{while working}} in advertising, he began {{performing}} as a musical cartoonist with symphony orchestras at children's and pops concerts, drawing <b>in</b> <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm</b> with the music. In 1948 he was the writer and star of the evening comedy show Cartoon Capers on WBEN-TV in Buffalo, NY and also of a children's show called Junior Jamboree on the same station. He was sometimes a guest host on the NBC Children's show Birthday House when the regular host, Paul Tripp, was unavailable. In the 1950s he appeared regularly on the CBS-TV children's program Captain Kangaroo as [...] "Mister Artist." ...|$|E
5000|$|On the Ralph Records release Songs for Swinging Larvae by Renaldo and the Loaf, {{the last}} song on side one {{continues}} {{into the inner}} spiral and into the inner groove with a loop of a male voice providing a spoken percussion effect of [...] "boom boom crash crash," [...] which, however, when it reaches the inner groove is not strictly in the same 4/4 rhythm, being more in 5/8 ("boom boom crash crash crash") This motif reappears (<b>in</b> <b>strict</b> 4/4 <b>rhythm</b> again) <b>in</b> the lead-in groove opening Side Two of the album, which then leads to the first selection on that side.|$|R
50|$|Improvised flamenco {{songs of}} ancient Andalusian origin are called cante jondo, and are {{characterized}} by a reduced tonal ambiance, a <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm,</b> baroque ornamentation and repetition of notes. Cante jondo is sung by a single singer (cantaor).|$|R
50|$|The pesindhèn may sing {{together}} with a gerong (male chorus), but their styles and words will be different. The part of the sindhen is largely improvised within strict parameters (similar to instrumental cengkok). The sindhen is also allowed a much freer rhythm, similar to the rebab and suling, instead of the <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm</b> of the gerong.|$|R

Without {{wanting to go}} the inner way from 'Idea' or 'Emotion' and so on, to 'spiritual beinghood', the standards are lacking. The musical moving force for the new qualities become the themes which centralize everything with their weaving metamorphoses http://www.metamorphosen-symphonien and <b>strict</b> <b>rhythms,</b> as also the dissonances and harmonies.|$|R

Its distinct sound incorporates different electronic instruments, synthesizers, drum machines, toy instruments, toys, electronic devices as well as conventional classical instrument such as organ and flute, often combined with voice synthesis like vocoders and text-to-speech software. The music is programmed with help of sequencers in a controlled style, often with very <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm</b> quantification <b>in</b> strive to obtain its [...] "machine-like" [...] sound.|$|R
50|$|Spinning {{and weaving}} songs. In {{spinning}} songs the main topic is the spinning itself, the spinner, and the spinning wheel while weaving songs mention the weaving process, the weaver, the loom, the delicate linens. Some spinning songs are cheerful and humorous, while others resemble the milling songs which bemoan the woman's hard lot and longing for {{their homes and}} parents. The texts describe the work process, while the refrains mimic the whirring of the spinning wheel. There are also highly unique spinning sutartinės, typified by clear and <b>strict</b> <b>rhythms.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The piece {{quickly became}} one of Glass's most popular works, and appears {{on a number of}} recordings. Gidon Kremer, the first soloist to record the work, says the concerto [...] "is a work typical of Glass, in which a certain enigmatic drive allows the {{performer}} to feel both bound to <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm</b> and free <b>in</b> his fantasy." [...] The success of the concerto inspired Glass to branch out into yet more orchestral writing: his first fully formed work for orchestra alone, The Light, emerged in the same year as the violin concerto and was followed by a proliferation of concertos and symphonies over the following years.|$|R
50|$|Catullus uses no {{variations}} at {{all here}} and he employs diminutives (cuniculi, medullula, imula, oricila) contemptuously in {{a description of the}} 'soft' Thallus. Note that doubling of the consonant l lengthens several syllables that are naturally short, thus enabling a <b>strict</b> iambic <b>rhythm.</b>|$|R

50|$|Notley's {{experimentation}} with poetic form, seen in her books 165 Meeting House Lane, When I Was Alive, The Descent of Alette, and Culture of One, ranges from a blurred line between genres, to a quotation-mark driven {{interpretation of the}} variable foot, to a full reinvention of the purpose and potential of <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm</b> and meter. She also experimented with channeling spirits of deceased loved ones, primarily men gone from her life like her father and her husband, poet Ted Berrigan, and used these conversations as topics and form on her poetry. Her poems have also been compared to Gertrude Stein, {{as well as her}} contemporary Bernadette Mayer. Mayer and Notley both used their experience as mothers and wives in their work.|$|R
5000|$|The bass guitarist {{sometimes}} {{breaks out}} of the <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm</b> section role to perform bass breaks or bass solos. The types of bass lines used for bass breaks or bass solos vary by style. In a rock band, a bass break may consist of the bassist playing a riff or lick during a pause in the song. In some styles of metal, a bass break may consist of [...] "shred guitar"-style tapping on the bass. In a funk or funk rock band, a bass solo may showcase the bassist's percussive slap and pop playing. In genres such as progressive rock, art rock, or progressive metal, the bass guitar player may play melody lines along with the lead guitar (or vocalist) and perform extended guitar solos.|$|R
40|$|Running time: 80 Minutes Only a Free Individual Can Create a Free Society is {{commissioned}} by FLAMIN Productions through Film London Artists’ Moving Image Network; Badischer Kunstverein, Karlsruhe; Eastside Projects, Birmingham and The Showroom, London {{in association with}} Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver; Institute of Contemporary Interdisciplinary Arts, Bath; Site Gallery, Sheffield; Tramway, Glasgow and Zeno X Gallery, Antwerp. Supported by Arts Council England, Hessian Film Fund, and Jerwood Charitable Foundation. “Only a Free Individual Can Create a Free Society" revisits discussions that Schwindt witnessed during her childhood, surrounded by radical leftwing individuals in Frankfurt, Germany. The text, which appears in various forms throughout the film, {{is based on an}} interview that she recorded over the telephone with a former radical leftwing activist {{who took part in the}} student movement in Germany in the 60 s and 70 s. She questions how freedom was, and is, understood, who has access to it and what political and social structures need to be in place to create a free society. Dancers in theatrical sets recite the interview while carrying out a precisely constructed choreography. The film sets are positioned on a hill overlooking London. Large photographic prints reference cityscapes of London as well as images of Blythe Hill Park and Telegraph Hill where Schwindt’s studio is located. Eleven dancers carry out a tightly scripted choreography that has a <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm</b> between stillness and movement. The signification of the still and moving body is positioned through a precise relationship to space, other bodies, objects, speech and images. All elements of the production are understood within a choreographic schema; set, props, costume, lighting, sound, camera movement. Each element is equally important and should be read together as a melody with a <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm</b> that comes together through a script that might be better described as a score...|$|R

50|$|Spinning {{and weaving}} songs {{are the most}} {{important}} of the songs about work done in the home. The imagery of both is very similar and it is not always easy todistinguish one from the other. In spinning songs the main topic is the spinning itself, the spinner, and the spinning wheel. In some there are humorous references to the tow or the lazy spinners who have not mastered the art of spinning and weaving by the time they are to be married. Some spinning songs are cheerful and humorous, while others resemble the milling songs which bemoan the woman's hard lot and longing for their homes and parents. These songs have characteristic melodies. There are also highly unique spinning sutartinės, typified by clear and <b>strict</b> <b>rhythms.</b> The texts describe the work process, while the refrains mimic the whirring of the spinning wheel.|$|R
5000|$|The guitar intro {{begins with}} the {{scratching}} of strings dampened with left-hand muting, before settling on an open D string dampened by palm muting. As heard earlier on the album, on [...] "Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1", the muted D is treated with a specific delay setting, providing three to four loud but gradually decaying repeats, one dotted-eighth note apart, {{with the result that}} simply playing quarter notes (at 116 beats per minute) will produce a <b>strict</b> <b>rhythm</b> of one eighth note followed by two sixteenth notes, with rhythmic echoes overlapping. Over this pedal tone of D, Gilmour plays descending triads in D major (mostly D, A, and G), down to the open chord position (a quieter, second overdubbed guitar plays open chords only). Some of the guitar tracks are also treated with a heavy flanging effect.|$|R
