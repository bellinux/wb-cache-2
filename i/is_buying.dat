500|$|The Court {{held that}} despite not {{mentioning}} the words [...] "straw buyers", the federal gun law that regulates transactions with “persons” or “transferees” considers the “persons” or “transferees” {{to be the}} ones getting the gun {{at the end of the}} day, not the straw persons completing the transaction on their behalf. Failure to interpret the law in such way, the Court held, would undermine the purpose of the law, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands.

[...] The majority found Abramski's theory, that the federal law only cares about the person that <b>is</b> <b>buying</b> the gun and not the final buyer not to be true. The Court's majority opinion, written by Justice Kagan, held that if you interpret the terms “person” and “transferee,” to mean “the man at the counter”, you would undermine the purpose of the statutes, which is to prevent guns from falling into the wrong hands. The Court therefore preferred to interpret the terms “person,” and “transferee,” to mean “the man getting, and always meant to get, the firearm”.|$|E
