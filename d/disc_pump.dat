40|$|Lecturepg. 69 This paper {{describes}} a unique pumping concept {{based on a}} noncontact mechanism operating solely using the principles of boundary layer and viscous drag. The first section focuses on the pumping technology itself, describing how the pump mechanism operates, while the second section examines how the pump functions in problem applications, such as handling abrasive, viscous, high solids, air-entrained, and shear sensitive fluids. The next section describes the pump operating and design characteristics, including information on the pump?s NPSH requirement and other standard pump performance data. The final section {{describes a}}nd end-user?s experience with the <b>disc</b> <b>pump</b> in an oil refinery application. The <b>disc</b> <b>pump</b> system operates solely using the principles of boundary layer and viscous drag, two phenomena well-known in fluid engineering. Although superficially the <b>disc</b> <b>pump</b> looks like a centrifugal unit, it has no impeller in the traditional sense, and uses instead a series of parallel, rotating discs, referred to in this paper as the ?disc assembly,? to generate the energy necessary to move product. The key difference between the disc assembly and a standard centrifugal pump impeller is that, with the disc assembly, the pumpage does not impinge on the rotating pump mechanism, so that it generates a pulsation-free, laminar flow pattern through the pump. The <b>disc</b> <b>pump</b> can operate effectively in hard-to-pump applications because it lacks an ?impingement? device, which results in minimal contact between the pump and pumpage...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} practical {{problem in}} the application and study of drag reduction by polymer additives is the degradation of the polymer, for instance due to intense shearing, especially in recirculatory flow systems. Such degradation leads to a marked loss of the drag-reducing capability of the polymer. Three different polymer types were tested on degradation effects in a closed pipe flow system. The polymers used were Polyox WSR- 301, Separan AP- 273 and Superfloc A- 110, dissolved in water in concentrations of 20 wppm each. The flow system consisted of a 16. 3 mm pipe of 4. 25 m length. Two different pumps were used: a centrifugal pump and a <b>disc</b> <b>pump.</b> Different solution-preparation procedures were tried and the experiments were performed at different flow rates. Superfloc A- 110 proved to be both the most effective drag reducer and most resistant to degradation. Because of very fast degradation, Polyox WSR- 301 {{was found to be}} unsuitable for being used as a drag reducer in re-circulatory systems. The <b>disc</b> <b>pump</b> proved to be much better suited for pumping the polymer solutions than the centrifugal pump. The degradation curve of the combination Superfloc/disc pump showed a plateau-like region with reasonable drag reduction, which makes it possible to perform (laser Doppler) measurements under nearly constant circumstances during a sufficient time...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{research into}} technological means for addressing two consequences {{of climate change}} for coral ocean acidity and increasing sea surface temperatures leading to coral bleaching. Technology for a multi- integrated response is proposed. Sea surface temperatures can be monitored via satellite and on-line telemetry. Technology for moderating sea surface temperature spikes is based on pumping deeper cool seawater over coral reefs. The technology proposed includes plastic collapsible pipelines that can be deployed like oil spill booms with flat <b>disc</b> <b>pumps</b> and renewable energy devices (tidal turbines) to power the pumps. The technology for counteracting increasing ocean acidity on coral reefs {{is based on the}} Accelerated Weathering of Limestone (AWL). It is proposed that an acceleration of the natural process that restores the carbon balance, can be realized using a modified electrolyzer powered by renewable energy. The AWL process sequesters CO₂ and produces H₂ while generating a buffer solution that increases reef pH and also provides alkalinity to feed reef and shellfish calcification. The AWL buffer solution will be distributed where required using the same renewable energy powered pumps and pipelines as used to mitigate sea surface temperature spikes. The AWL process will operate continuously but can be interrupted whenever the pumps and collapsible pipes are required to avoid potential coral thermal bleaching events. Dual use improves affordability...|$|R
40|$|The need of circulatory {{support systems}} in the {{treatment}} of chronic heart failure is increasing constantly, as 20 % of the patients on the waiting list die every year. Despite the great need for mechanical heart support systems, the use of available systems is limited by its expensiveness. In addition, there is no one system that is 100 % responsible to all medical and technical requirements and that would be completely safe for patient. Therefore, further research in the field of circulatory support systems considering health and technical requirements is relevant. One of the new directions in the study are <b>disc</b> <b>pumps</b> of viscous friction for liquid transporting, based on the Tesla pump principle. The operation principle of such pumps is based on the phenomenon of the boundary layer which is formed on the disk rotating in a fluid. There are experimental studies of models with different variants of the rotor suspension, various forms and numbers of the disks, forms of the pump housing. However, none of the above samples was brought to clinical trials. Furthermore, despite the potential of that model there have been no pumps of similar type used so far in circulatory support systems. Published data provide a basis for further development and testing of the pump model and allow hoping for leveling a number of significant shortcomings of modern left ventricular bypass systems.  </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt is very {{important}} to maintain the stability of pump pressure in water mist system for higher fire suppression efficiency. In recent years, the optimization of design of the multi-plunger pump to reduce the pulsation of output pressure is an urgent problem to be solved. In the present study, the flow pulsation and frequency characteristics of multi-plunger canted <b>disc</b> link <b>pump</b> were simulated based on the kinematical equations. The kinetic characteristics of this type of pump were expounded through the calculation results.

40|$|Rim seals are {{fitted in}} gas {{turbines}} at {{the periphery of}} the wheel-space formed between rotor discs and their adjacent casings. These seals, also called platform overlap seals, reduce the ingress of hot gases which can limit the life of highly-stressed components in the engine. This paper describes the development of a new, patented rim-seal concept showing improved performance relative to a reference engine design, using URANS computations of a turbine stage at engine conditions. The CFD study was limited to a small number of purge-flow rates due to computational time and cost, and the computations were validated experimentally at a lower rotational Reynolds number and in conditions under incompressible flow. The new rim seal features a stator-side angel wing and two buffer cavities between outer and inner seals: the angel-wing promotes a counter-rotating vortex to reduce the effect of the ingress on the stator; the two buffer cavities are shown to attenuate the circumferential pressure asymmetries of the fluid ingested from the mainstream annulus. Rotor <b>disc</b> <b>pumping</b> is exploited to reduce the sealing flow rate required to prevent ingress, with the rotor boundary layer also providing protective cooling. Measurements of gas concentration and swirl ratio, determined from static and total pressure, were used to assess the performance of the new seal concept relative to a bench-mark generic seal. The radial variation of concentration through the seal was measured in the experiments and these data captured the improvements due to the intermediate buffer cavities predicted by the CFD. This successful design approach is a potent combination of insight provided by computation, and the flexibility and expedience provided by experiment...|$|R
40|$|Dual Gradient Drilling is an {{exciting}} technology which promises to solve the current technical hurdles and economic risks of Deepwater Drilling. Several techniques for Dual Gradient Drilling have been proposed to the industry. One such method involves installing a subsea booster pump at the seafloor {{with the aim of}} returning the drilling fluid back to the rig. The pump will manage annular pressures in the wellbore as circulation rates and mud weights vary and will permit early detection of wellbore influxes. Any such pump chosen to achieve this objective will be subjected to very high differential pressures and will be faced with the onerous task of lifting very abrasive and viscous mud slurries from the sea floor back to the drilling rig. This distance in deep water may be well within the range of about 4, 000 ? 12, 000 feet depending on the operating water depth of the rig. Several pump technologies available to the industry were examined. Piston pumps are very efficient and can withstand the high differential pressures encountered in the Mudlift Drilling System. However, their drawbacks are their large size and weight and high initial capital cost and maintenance costs. Centrifugal pumps on the other hand are relatively smaller than piston and diaphragm pumps and are generally less expensive. <b>Disc</b> <b>pumps,</b> with their non-impingement design are able to handle solids and fluids with a high gas volume fraction but, like centrifugal pumps, are generally less efficient than reciprocating pumps. Diaphragm pumps are capable of maintaining a constant rate regardless of pressure fluctuations. They can handle very abrasive solids with limited wear on the pump. They also excel at handling very viscous fluids and they can be modified to handle up to 95 % gas volume fraction. Like piston pumps, they have very high efficiencies. The potential of each of these pump technologies to meet the requirements for the Mudlift Drilling System was examined in this thesis. The benefits and drawbacks of each of these pump technologies were highlighted and modifications {{to meet the demands of}} the mudlift system evaluated...|$|R

40|$|A disc with radial vanes and {{circumferential}} pillars {{proves to}} be successful in operation and achieves energy efficiency improvements compared with those of traditional design. Cooling characteristics of this novel design are practically identical to the disc with tangential vanes but the equivalent aerodynamic (air pumping) losses are approximately 50 % less. It is shown that these reductions in pumping losses can lead to substantial energy savings in train operations. When developing new designs and/or comparing different railway disc designs, the proposed disc cooling to aerodynamic efficiency ratio ([eta]v) was found to be a very useful parameter to assess. This [`]efficiency ratio' - a ratio of convective power dissipation to aerodynamic power losses can help in achieving adequate balance of cooling efficiency and aerodynamic losses to suit particular application. The use of CFD is of enormous benefit in generating discs that fulfil these demanding requirements, with the spin rig being exceptionally useful for experimental work.

40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} the {{eccentricity}} of a planet on an inclined orbit {{with respect to a}} <b>disc</b> can be <b>pumped</b> up to high values by the gravitational potential of the disc, even when the orbit of the planet crosses the disc plane. This process is an extension of the Kozai effect. If the orbit of the planet is well inside the disc inner cavity, the process is formally identical to the classical Kozai effect. If the planet's orbit crosses the disc but most of the disc mass is beyond the orbit, the eccentricity of the planet grows when the initial angle between the orbit and the disc is larger than some critical value which may be significantly smaller than the classical value of 39 degrees. Both the eccentricity and the inclination angle then vary periodically with time. When the period of the oscillations of the eccentricity is smaller than the disc lifetime, the planet may be left on an eccentric orbit as the disc dissipates.

In its present configuration (after some modifications have been brought in), the MG 50 offers significant advantages which will be discussed in detail. For a batch of 58 samples tested in one hour on twelve channels a single technician is required instead of 3 to 4; sample supply of equipment is therefore made in a more regular way. In case of run interrupt a single series of 12 determinations is implicated and can be immediately checked. The whole analysis process is limited to twice 11 minutes due to the continuous agitation of <b>discs.</b> The tubing <b>pump</b> priming is automatically performed and the reagent homogeneity is better insured; the presence of dilution tubes is easily controlled.

40|$|The South endcap {{calorimeter}} {{vessel was}} moved into Lab A on Sept. 18, 1990. A cooldown {{of the pressure}} vessel with liquid nitrogen was performed on Sept. 26 to check the vessel's integrity. With the pressure vessel cold, the insulating vacuum was monitored for leaks. Through out the testing, the insulating vacuum remained good and the vessel passed the test. The cold test was carried out per the procedures of D-Zero engineering note 3740. 220 -EN- 250. The test was {{very similar to the}} cold test performed on the Central Calorimeter in October of 1987. The test of the ECS was performed in the same manner using the same equipment as the ECN cold test. Reference D-Zero engineering notes 3740. 210 -EN- 122, 3740. 000 -EN-I 07, and 3740. 210 -EN-II 0 for information about the CC cold test. Reference EN- 260 for the results of the ECN cold test. The insulating vacuum space was pumped on while equipment was being connected to the pressure vessel. Two hours after starting to pump with the blower the vacuum space pressure was at about 40 microns. The pumping continued overnight (another 16 hours). In the morning the pressure was 11. 5 microns. A rate of rise test was performed. With the pump valved off, the pressure rose to 14 microns within 5 minutes and then rose to 16 microns in 6 hours (0. 33 microns/hour). After all connections were made to the pressure vessel, a vacuum pump with an estimated effective pumping speed of about 70 scfm was valved on. After 18 hours, the pressure vessel was down to 270 microns. An additional day of pumping took the pressure down to only 250 microns.

40|$|Aim. Experimental {{evaluation}} of the viscous friction disk pump efficiency, studying the relationship between inter-disk clearance and sizes of input and output ports and pump performance parameters. Materials and methods. To assess the characteristics and to optimize the disk friction pump design the pump model and experimental stand were created. Pump dimensions were set {{on the basis of}} medical and biological requirements for mechanical heart support systems and with due consideration of the experimental studies of our colleagues from Pennsylvania. Flow volume of the working fluid was measured by float rotameter Krohne VA- 40 with measurement error of not more than 1 %. The pressure values in the hydrodynamic circuit were measured using a monitor manufactured by Biosoft-M. Expansion device allowed changing the flow resistance of the system simulating the total peripheral resistance of the circulatory system. Results. Linear direct correlation between the pump performance and the pressure drop of liquid being created at the inlet and outlet of the pump was obtained.  The required flow rate (5 – 7 l/min) and pressure (90 – 100 mmHg) were reached when the rotor speed was in the range of 2500 – 3000 rev/min. It has been shown that the increase of the inlet diameter to 15 mm has not resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} pump performance, and that the highest efficiency values can be obtained for the magnitude of inter-disk gap of 0. 4 – 0. 5 mm.
