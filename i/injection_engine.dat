Penske had another outright victory at the Utah Grand Prix and also recorded an additional three class wins. At Petit Le Mans a 3rd RS Spyder was entered by Penske {{in an attempt to}} lock out the manufacturers' championship against Acura. Penske won both the LMP2 Team and drivers' championship for Timo Bernhard and Romain Dumas. Porsche won the manufacturers' championship by 1 point ahead of Acura.|$|E

The Vialle LPDI system is designed for modern direct <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> like the Ford EcoBoost, Volkswagen FSI, TSI and Hyundai GDI engines. The LPDI system utilizes the OEM high-pressure fuel pump and injectors to deliver either gasoline or autogas to the engine.

2500|$|The {{new model}} was first {{announced}} for the Chinese market on the 2014 Beijing Auto Show {{and went on}} sale in August 2014.

2500|$|Unlike races {{such as the}} TT Formulae, or Moto-Cross, {{where two}} and four strokes had {{different}} engine size limits in the same class, until 2002 GP racing set the upper limit the same for both types of engines in all its classes. After that, MotoGP gave the four-strokes a 490cc advantage over the two-strokes. A 2 stroke engine produces power with every rotation of the crank, where as the 4 stroke engine produces power every second rotation. In theory, a 500cc 2stroke produces the same power as a 1000cc 4 stroke, however there are many {{differences between the two}} configurations. Carburation vs fuel <b>injection,</b> <b>engine</b> mapping, power/torque curves, and throttle response are a few major differences.|$|E
2500|$|Volkswagen began {{introducing}} {{an array}} of new models after Bernd Pischetsrieder became Volkswagen Group CEO (responsible for all Group brands) in 2002. The sixth-generation VW Golf was launched in 2008, came runner-up to the Opel/Vauxhall Insignia in the 2009 European Car of the Year, and has spawned several cousins: VW Jetta, VW Scirocco, SEAT León, SEAT Toledo, Škoda Octavia and Audi A3 hatchback ranges, {{as well as a}} new mini-MPV, the SEAT Altea. The GTI, a [...] "hot hatch" [...] performance version of the Golf, boasts a 2.0L Turbocharged Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct <b>injection</b> <b>engine.</b> VW began marketing the Golf under the Rabbit name once again in the U.S. and Canada in 2006.|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of particle emissions from gasoline port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> {{have not been}} fully investigated and established in comparison with those from direct-injection spark ignition engines. This paper aims to evaluate a new measurement system that could potentially be adapted later to allow a much wider examination of particulate production from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> relative to gasoline direct-injection engines. This work presents the morphology of the particles emitted from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> analysed using scanning transmission electron microscopy. The current designs of dilution tunnel used in particle morphology measurements were reviewed, and subsequently a new dilution tunnel was designed, built, tested and optimised for nanoparticle measurements from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines.</b> A new methodology for capturing nanoparticles from port fuel <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> for morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy was investigated by integrating a nanoparticle impactor with a dilution tunnel. The performance of the dilution tunnel demonstrated that it integrated very well with the impactor and achieved the targets {{in terms of the}} flow rate and the temperature. The widest variety of particle morphologies, including liquid particles, was observed on the transmission electron microscopy grid from impactor plate A. In addition to soot agglomerates, crystalline particles and salt particles were also seen. In contrast with earlier studies, particle fragmentation was also observed...|$|R

2500|$|The upgrade also {{included}} electronic stability control VDC (Vehicle Dynamic Control) with an emergency brake assist device and slip control ASR (Anti Slip Regulation) came as standard. Additionally a MSR (Motor Schleppmoment Regelung) {{was added to}} the car, this device prevents wheel skidding by restoring torque to the engine for example when the gear is shifted down abruptly under conditions of low grip. Passive safety was also made better, all versions got window airbags as standard. The 2.0 L JTS [...] gasoline direct <b>injection</b> <b>engine</b> replaced the 2.0 litre Twin Spark engine, offering more low end torque and more power than the Twin Spark, diesel engines were also uprated. The only notable difference exterior-wise was body coloured mirrors and bumper strips which were earlier black.|$|E
2500|$|Single tank {{conversions}} {{have been}} developed, largely in Germany, {{which have been}} used throughout Europe. [...] These conversions are designed to provide reliable operation with rapeseed oil that meets the German rapeseed oil fuel standard DIN 51605. [...] Modifications to the engines cold start regime assist combustion on start up and during the engine warm up phase. [...] Suitably modified indirect injection (IDI) engines {{have proven to be}} operable with 100% PPO down to temperatures of [...] [...] Direct injection (DI) engines generally have to be preheated with a block heater or diesel fired heater. [...] The exception is the VW Tdi (Turbocharged Direct <b>Injection)</b> <b>engine</b> for which a number of German companies offer single tank conversions. [...] For long term durability it has been found necessary to increase the oil change frequency and to pay increased attention to engine maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|Volkswagen {{partnered with}} Daimler AG and other {{companies}} to market the BlueTec clean diesel technology on cars and trucks from Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, {{and other companies}} and brands. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, four of the ten most fuel-efficient vehicles available {{for sale in the}} U.S. are powered by Volkswagen diesel engines. Volkswagen has offered a number of its vehicles with a TDI (Turbocharged Direct <b>Injection)</b> <b>engine,</b> which lends class-leading fuel economy to several models. They were a three-way tie for 8th (TDI Beetle, TDI Golf, TDI Jetta) and ninth, the TDI Jetta Wagon. In addition, all Volkswagen TDI diesel engines produced from 1996 to 2006 can be driven on 100% biodiesel fuel. [...] For the 2007 model year, however, strict U.S. government emissions regulations have forced VW to drop most diesels from their U.S. engine lineup, but a new lineup of diesel engines compatible to U.S. standards returned to the American market starting with Model Year 2009. These post-2009 Clean Diesel engines are limited to running on 5% (B5) biodiesel only to maintain Volkswagen's warranty. Volkswagen long resisted adding a SUV to its lineup, but relented with the introduction of the Touareg, made in partnership with Porsche, while they worked on the Porsche Cayenne and later the Audi Q7. Though acclaimed as a fine handling vehicle, the Touareg has been a modest seller at best, and it has been criticised by auto reviewers for its absence of a third-row seat, the relatively poor fuel economy, and the high vehicle mass. VW set plans to add a compact SUV with styling influences from the [...] "Concept A" [...] concept vehicle introduced at the 2006 Geneva Auto Show, and on 20 July 2006, VW announced that the new vehicle, called the Tiguan.|$|E

50|$|In 2013, a {{research}} by TÜV NORD found that although gasoline direct <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> dramatically reduce CO2 emissions, they release about 1,000 times more particles classified by the World Health Organization as harmful than traditional petrol engines and 10 {{times more than}} new diesel engines. The release happens because direct injection results in uneven burning of fuel due to uneven mixing of fuel and air (stratification) and because direct <b>injection</b> <b>engines</b> operate with a higher pressure in their cylinders than the older engines.|$|R
