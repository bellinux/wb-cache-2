500|$|In 1984, American Continental Corporation bought Lincoln Savings and Loan Association {{for just}} over $50 million. Up {{through the early}} 1980s, Lincoln had been a conservatively-run enterprise, with almost half its assets in home loans and {{only a quarter of}} its assets {{considered}} at risk. It made slow growth at best, and had shown a loss for several years until it made a profit of a few million dollars in 1983. Once he took over, Keating fired the existing management. Savings and loan associations had been deregulated in the early 1980s, allowing them to make high-risk investments with their depositors' money, a change of which Keating and other savings and loan operators took advantage. When Keating later was asked why he got into savings and loans, he said, [...] "I know the business inside out, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> an S & L, if they'd relax the rules, was the biggest moneymaker in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huston's parents {{divorced}} in 1913, {{when he was}} 6, {{and as a result}} much of his childhood was spent living in boarding schools. During summer vacations, he traveled with each of his parents separately— with his father on vaudeville tours, and with his mother to racetracks or other sports events. The young Huston benefited greatly from seeing his father act on stage, as he was later drawn to the world of acting. Some critics, such as Lawrence Grobel, surmise that his relationship with his mother may have been the cause of his five marriages, and why few of his relationships lasted. Grobel wrote, [...] "When I interviewed some of the women who had loved him, they inevitably referred to his mother as the key to unlocking Huston's psyche." [...] According to actress Olivia de Havilland, [...] "she [...] was the central character. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> John was ridden by witches. He seemed pursued by something destructive. If it wasn't his mother, it was his idea of his mother." ...|$|E

Then two years ago, I heard that your father and mother had been in Natal, but had gone to England, and that you were dead. Yes, a man told me that you were dead," [...] he added with a gulp.

60|$|I am {{so sorry}} that I have been so foolish, but you must confess, sir, {{that you have been}} just a little bit foolish also. The idea of supposing that when I love a man my love can be {{affected}} by the size of his house or the amount of his income. It makes me smile to think of it. Do you suppose a woman's happiness is affected by whether she has a breakfast-room, or a billiard-board, or a collie dog, {{or any of the other}} luxuries which you enumerated? But these things are all the merest trimmings of life. They are not the essentials. YOU and your love are the essentials. Some one who will love me with all his heart. Some one whom I can love with all my heart. Oh the difference it makes in life! How it changes everything! It glorifies and beautifies everything. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I was capable of a great love--and now I have it.|$|E
6000|$|She {{raised her}} face towards him now, {{and he gave}} a grave kiss to her forehead. She drew a long breath, and said after a little pause, 'And now I have {{something}} to say. One does think of such things even in these sad times, and you can help me. I am so glad it is you, because I know you will, and be rejoiced to do so. You know when Mark found us out first, dear mother and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{it was a great}} pity he should not have the estate he had been brought up to expect. I believe dear mother thought {{it would have been the}} right thing for me to marry him, but I always did mean to give it back to him, even when I didn't like him. Well, then, you know it all seemed settled otherwise, but now, it is so lucky you spoke to me while that dear little fellow was with us, because now you will help me to persuade my father that it is the only satisfactory thing to do to let it go in the male line to Mark and his Willy.' ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Campbell, {{springing}} to her feet: [...] "Willis, you are inspired! Oh, how perfectly delightful! And it's so delicate of you {{to think}} of that! I will just enclose his note--give it here, Willis--and he need never know that it ever went to the wrong address. Oh, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> you were truly refined, anyway." [...] He passively yields the letter, and she whirls away to a writing-desk {{in the corner of}} the room. [...] "Now, I'll just keep a copy of the letter--for a joke; I think I've a perfect right to"--scribbling furiously away--"and then I'll match the paper with an envelope--I can do that perfectly--and then I'll just imitate his hand--such fun!--and send it flying over to Margaret Rice. Oh, how good! Touch the bell, Willis;" [...] and then--as the serving-maid appears--"Yes, Jane! Run right across the lawn to Mrs. Rice's, and give this letter for Miss Margaret, and say it was left here by mistake. Well, it was, Willis. Fly, Jane! Oh, Willis, love! Isn't it perfect! Of course she'll have got his formal reply to my invitation, and be all mixed up by it, and now when this note comes, she'll see through it all in an instant, and it will be such a relief to her; and oh, she'll think that he's directed both the letters to her because he couldn't think of any one else! Isn't it lovely? Just like anything that's nice, it's ten times as nice as you expected it to be; and--" ...|$|E
60|$|The other remark which I {{wish to make}} here is also a {{rectification}} but of a less direct kind. It {{has nothing}} to do with the medium of expression. It bears on the matter of my authorship in another way. It is not for me to criticize my judges, the more so because <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I was receiving more than justice at their hands. But it seems to me that their unfailingly interested sympathy has ascribed to racial and historical influences much, of what, I believe, appertains simply to the individual. Nothing is more foreign than what in the literary world is called Sclavonism, to the Polish temperament with its tradition of self-government, its chivalrous view of moral restraints and an exaggerated respect for individual rights: not to mention the important fact that the whole Polish mentality, Western in complexion, had received its training from Italy and France and, historically, had always remained, even in religious matters, in sympathy with the most liberal currents of European thought. An impartial view of humanity in all its degrees of splendour and misery together with a special regard for the rights of the unprivileged of this earth, not on any mystic ground but on the ground of simple fellowship and honourable reciprocity of services, was the dominant characteristic of the mental and moral atmosphere of the houses which sheltered my hazardous childhood:--matters of calm and deep conviction both lasting and consistent, and removed as far as possible from that humanitarianism that seems to be merely a matter of crazy nerves or a morbid conscience.|$|E
60|$|It is {{sometimes}} my pleasant duty to visit other cities, {{in the hope}} of being able to encourage their art students; but here it is my pleasanter privilege to come for encouragement myself. I do not know when I have received so much as from the report read this evening by Mr. Hammersley, bearing upon a subject which has caused me great anxiety. For I have always felt in my own pursuit of art, and in my endeavors to urge the pursuit of art on others, that while there are many advantages now that never existed before, there are certain grievous difficulties existing, just in the very cause that is giving the stimulus to art--in the immense spread of the manufactures of every country which is now attending vigorously to art. We find that manufacture and art are now going on always together; that where there is no manufacture there is no art. I know how much there is of pretended art where there is no manufacture: there is much in Italy, for instance; no country makes so bold pretence to the production of new art as Italy at this moment; yet no country produces so little. If you glance over the map of Europe, you will find that where the manufactures are strongest, there art also is strongest. And yet <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> there was an immense difficulty to be encountered by the students who were in these centres of modern movement. They had to avoid the notion that art and manufacture were in any respect one. Art may be healthily associated with manufacture, and probably in future will always be so; but the student must be strenuously warned against supposing that they can ever be one and the same thing, that art can ever be followed on the principles of manufacture. Each must be followed separately; the one must influence the other, but each must be kept distinctly separate from the other.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Byron had one {{pre-eminent}} fault,--a fault {{which must}} be considered as [...] deeply criminal by everyone who does not, as I do, believe it to have [...] resulted from monomania. He had a morbid love of a bad reputation. [...] There was hardly an offence of which he would not, with perfect [...] indifference, accuse himself. An old schoolfellow who met him on the [...] Continent {{told me that he}} would continually write paragraphs against [...] himself in the foreign journals, and delight in their republication by [...] the English newspapers as in the success of a practical joke. Whenever [...] anybody has related anything discreditable of Byron, assuring me that [...] it must be true, for he heard it from himself, <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he [...] could not have spoken upon worse authority; and that, in all [...] probability, the tale was a pure invention. If I could remember, and [...] were willing to repeat, the various misdoings which I have from time [...] to time heard him attribute to himself, I could fill a volume. But I [...] never believed them. I very soon became aware of this strange [...] idiosyncrasy: it puzzled me to account for it; but there it was, a [...] sort of diseased and distorted vanity. The same eccentric spirit [...] would induce him to report things which were false with regard to his [...] family, which anybody else would have concealed, though true. He told [...] me more than once that his father was insane, and killed himself. I [...] shall never forget the manner in which he first told me this. While [...] washing his hands, and singing a gay Neapolitan air, he stopped, [...] looked round at me, and said, [...] "There always was madness in the [...] family." [...] Then, after continuing his washing and his song, he added, [...] as if speaking of a matter of the slightest indifference, [...] "My father [...] cut his throat." [...] The contrast between the tenour of the subject and [...] the levity of the expression was fearfully painful: it was like a [...] stanza of [...] "Don Juan." [...] In this instance, I had no doubt that the fact [...] was as he related it; but in speaking of it, only a few years since, [...] to an old lady in whom I had perfect confidence, she assured me that [...] it was not so. Mr. Byron, who was her cousin, had been extremely [...] wild, but was quite sane, and had died very quietly in his bed. What [...] Byron's reason could have been for thus calumniating not only himself [...] but the blood which was flowing in his veins, who can divine? But, [...] for some reason or other, it seemed to be his determined purpose to [...] keep himself unknown to the great body of his fellow-creatures; to [...] present himself to their view in moral masquerade.' ...|$|E
