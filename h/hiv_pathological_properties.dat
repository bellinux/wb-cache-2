40|$|Adaption of the {{prototype}} A:FM: 1 : 47 H 1 N 1 strain to mice resulted in {{selection of the}} A:FM: 1 : 47 -MA variant with increased virulence. Earlier analysis identified mutations in the HA and M 1 genes that increase virulence in the mouse. Complete sequence analysis identified mutations in the PB 1, PB 2, HA, NA, and M 1 genes. Reassortants were produced between the parental FM and FM-MA strains to obtain viruses that differ due to combinations of mutant genes. To assess the relationship between virulence and replication, the median lethal dose was determined for mice and growth properties were assessed in mouse lung, MDCK cells and chicken embryo. Not only were all five mutations shown to control virulence but also the replicative capacity in the mouse. The HA, NA and M 1 mutations increased yield in all three hosts whereas in combination the PB 1 and PB 2 mutations were host restrictive changing the virus to a mouse specific strain. For the NA and M 1 mutations the increase in growth in mouse lung was proportional to a 2 -fold (log 10) increase in virulence however the HA mutation increased virulence largely indepen-dent of increased growth indicating a change in <b>pathological</b> <b>properties</b> that damage the host. Thus mutations that affect virulence can be classified according to host-dependent and independent ability to increase growth as well as changes in <b>pathological</b> <b>properties.</b> Each of the PB 1, PB 2, NA, HA, and M 1 genes acquired gain-of-function mutations for mouse infection that involve structural motifs that may serve as markers for virulence or targets fo...|$|R

Disruption of this network into other supramolecular assemblies was not tolerated. These results have bearing on the pathophysiology of streptococcal toxic shock...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that all numbers that are normal of order $k$ in base $b$ are also normal of all orders less than $k$. Another basic fact is that every real number is normal in base $b$ if and only if it is simply normal in base $b^k$ for all $k$. This may be {{interpreted}} to mean that a number is normal in base $b$ if and only if all blocks of digits occur with the desired relative frequency along every infinite arithmetic progression. We reinterpret these theorems for the $Q$-Cantor series expansions and show that they are no longer true in a particularly strong way.

All these approaches are claimed to be equivalent, but only {{in a few cases}} proofs have been given [3]. In this paper we show that a real number as well as a function on the reals are computable in Weihrauch's approach if and only if they are definable in Real PCF [5, 6], an extension of the functional language PCF [12] by new ground type representing intervals which approximate real numbers...|$|R
