5|$|Pepys was {{a senior}} {{official}} in the Navy Office by then, and he ascended the Tower of London on Sunday morning to view the fire from a turret. He recorded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> that the eastern gale had {{turned it into a}} conflagration. It had burned down several churches and, he estimated, 300 houses and reached the river front. The houses on London Bridge were burning.|$|E
5|$|Reed {{was very}} {{impressed}} with this information, and advocated for the Hastings Cutoff. None of the party received Bryant's letters warning them to avoid Hastings' route at all costs; <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> account, Bryant states his conviction that Bridger deliberately concealed the letters, a view shared by Reed in his later testimony.|$|E

5|$|After the 2/48th Battalion {{completed}} its training with the 9th Division at Cyrenaica, they were moved further {{along the coast}} to Gazala. Then, just {{as they began to}} dig in, the battalion was abruptly withdrawn to Tobruk in response to the German Afrika Korps' advance. They entered Tobruk on 9 April 1941, and spent the following eight months besieged by Axis forces. While there, Derrick acquired an Italian Breda machine gun and regularly led fighting patrols against both German and Italian troops. Although Derrick's bravery was noted during the siege, he wrote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> about his constant fear of dying.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's behest, the Volkssturm (People's Storm) – a {{nationwide}} militia of men previously considered unsuitable {{for military service}} – was formed on 18 October 1944. Goebbels recorded <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> that 100,000 recruits were sworn in from his Gau alone. However, the men, mostly age 45 to 60, received only rudimentary training and many were not properly armed. Goebbels' notion that these men could effectively serve {{on the front lines}} against Soviet tanks and artillery was unrealistic at best. The programme was deeply unpopular.|$|E
5|$|However, {{through the}} written {{dialogue}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary,</b> Choe did express slight {{differences between the}} cultures of China and Korea. For example, when the Chinese asked him {{whether or not the}} Korean education system offered degrees for specialists who dealt with only one of the Five Classics, Choe wrote that a Korean student who only studied one of the Classics and not all five of them was doomed to failing his exam and never attaining the rank of a full-fledged Confucian scholar.|$|E

5|$|In September 1928 Britten went as a boarder to Gresham's School, in Holt, Norfolk. At {{the time}} he felt unhappy there, even writing <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> of contemplating suicide or running away: he hated being {{separated}} from his family, most particularly from his mother; he despised the music master; and he was shocked at the prevalence of bullying, though {{he was not the}} target of it. He remained there for two years and in 1930, he won a composition scholarship at the Royal College of Music (RCM) in London; his examiners were the composers John Ireland and Ralph Vaughan Williams and the college's harmony and counterpoint teacher, S P Waddington.|$|E
5|$|It was {{a serious}} {{allegation}} to make against a physician. Reich wrote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> that the mother had been attracted to him and had made the allegation to damage him. She later committed suicide and Reich blamed himself. If Kahn did have an abortion, Turner wrote, {{she was the first}} of four of Reich's partners to do so: his first wife had several, and his long-term partners Elsa Lindenberg and Ilse Ollendorf (his second wife) each had one at Reich's insistence.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1645, Koniecpolski's wife, Krystyna, died. Koniecpolski {{remarried}} soon after, {{taking the}} hand of 16-year-old Zofia Opalińska, daughter of future Crown Marshal Łukasz Opaliński, on 16 January 1646. The marriage was short lived, though, ending with Koniecpolski's death in Brody on 11 March 1646. Sources suggest that his new marriage {{was the cause of}} his death; Joachim Jerlicz wrote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> that Koniecpolski had overdosed on an aphrodisiac. His funeral was held in Brody on 30 April 1646.|$|E

5|$|The British {{casualties}} were officially reported by Howe at 14 killed and 78 wounded, but {{a member of}} Howe's staff wrote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> that the loss was 14 killed and 154 wounded. David McCullough gives much higher figures of 90 killed and 300 wounded. The Americans had about 30 killed and 100 wounded, including Knowlton and Major Andrew Leitch among the dead. The American victory raised morale in the ranks, even among {{those who had not}} been engaged. It also marked the first victory of the war for the army directly under George Washington's command.|$|E
5|$|When Rommel {{was seriously}} wounded on 17 July 1944, the Propaganda Ministry {{undertook}} efforts {{to conceal the}} injury {{so as not to}} undermine domestic morale. Despite this, the news leaked to the British press. To counteract the rumors of a serious injury and even death, Rommel was required to appear at a press conference held on 1 August. On 3 August, the German press published an official report that Rommel had been injured in a car accident. Rommel noted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> his dismay at this twisting of the truth, belatedly realising how much the Reich propaganda was using him for its own ends.|$|E
5|$|After Prussia {{expressed}} an interest in the ship, the Emperor of France, Napoleon III, bought her in April for 2.5 million dollars over the objections of his own navy, which preferred a home-built ship. The exact date of purchase is unknown, but Welles noted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> on 7 May that Webb had told him of the sale. On 27 June, Webb refunded the money that had been paid to him and also purchased those items furnished by the government. A little over a week later, he attempted to sail to France, but had to return to port the following day due to engine problems. These were not resolved until 19 July when he, and his entire family, set sail. Dunderberg arrived at Cherbourg on 3 August and the French Navy took possession three days later.|$|E

5|$|As {{an adult}} Reich wrote extensively, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary,</b> about his sexual precocity. He {{maintained}} {{that his first}} sexual experience was {{at the age of}} four when he tried to have sex with the family maid (with whom he shared a bed), that he would regularly watch the farm animals have sex, that he used a whip handle sexually on the horses while masturbating, and that he had almost daily sexual intercourse from the age of 11 with another of the servants. He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17. He also developed sexual fantasies about his mother, writing when he was 22 that he masturbated while thinking about her.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1933, the Liberal Party had {{considered}} Howe {{as a potential}} candidate for the House of Commons. The Liberals were then in opposition. The public was angry over the inability of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett and his Conservative (or Tory) government {{to deal with the}} Depression, and the Liberals were considered likely to return to office at the next election, due by 1935. Howe, feeling political activism was bad for business, had not publicly expressed political views. Norman Platt Lambert, a Liberal Party official and friend of Howe, brought him to a meeting with Liberal Party leader and former Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King on 20 January 1934. The two men were impressed with each other, but each felt the other should make the next move. According to Lambert <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary,</b> Howe wanted a guaranteed Cabinet position were he to run in the new riding of Port Arthur.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} at Morley Memorial Junior School he was taught by Roger Waters' mother, Mary. Later, in 1957, he {{attended}} Cambridgeshire High School for Boys (with Waters). His father {{died of cancer}} on 11 December 1961, {{less than a month}} before Barrett's 16th birthday. Also on this day, Barrett had left the entry <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> blank. By this time, his brothers and sisters had left home and his mother decided to rent out rooms to lodgers. Eager to help her son recover from his grief, Barrett's mother encouraged the band in which he played, Geoff Mott and The Mottoes, a band which Barrett formed, to perform in their front room. Roger Waters and Syd Barrett were childhood friends, and Waters often visited such gigs. At one point, Waters even organised a gig, a CND benefit at Friends Meeting House on 11 March 1962, but shortly afterwards Geoff Mott joined the Boston Crabs, and the Mottoes broke up.|$|E

5|$|Evans was {{the only}} member of the Apple entourage to be invited to attend (and be a witness) when McCartney and Linda Eastman were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 12 March 1969. Evans wrote <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> that he was due to be there at 9.45am, but McCartney's brother, Michael's train from Birmingham was late. Peter Brown and Evans passed the {{register}} office at 9.15, and saw that there were only a few photographers and ardent fans standing in the rain, but when they left, after the wedding at 11.30am, they were mobbed by a crowd of about 1,000 people. When the Beatles played on the roof of Apple's offices in Savile Row, Evans was told to delay the policemen (who had arrived to stop the concert), as long as was possible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} months of the war, Goebbels' speeches and {{articles}} took on an increasingly apocalyptic tone. By the beginning of 1945, with the Soviets on the Oder River and the Western Allies preparing to cross the Rhine, he could no longer disguise the fact that defeat was inevitable. Berlin had {{little in the way of}} fortifications or artillery (or even Volkssturm units, 'civilian soldiers'), as almost everything had been sent to the front. Goebbels noted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary</b> on 21 January that millions of Germans were fleeing westward. He tentatively discussed with Hitler the issue of making peace overtures to the western allies, but Hitler again refused. Privately, Goebbels was conflicted at pushing the case with Hitler since he did not want to lose the confidence of his Führer.|$|E
5|$|While {{he reads}} the diary {{over the course of}} several months, Jake is confronted by his {{siblings}} about his own view of humans. He spends time with his sister’s human fiancée and visits the set of a film in which his brother stars. Jake is introduced to a human actress whom he finds attractive. As he reaches the end of his father’s diary, there is an entry detailing a time Jake was attacked by some human boys as a child. Jake, who had repressed the memory, discusses it with his mother. He learns the attack was stopped by members of ‘’Gallus Rex’’, an anti-human chicken group. Their actions colored Jake’s perception, and Elmer recorded his concerns about their effect on Jake <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>diary.</b>|$|E
