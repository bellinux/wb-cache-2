5|$|Some recent genetic {{evidence}} suggests the Indo-Pacific bottlenose {{belongs in the}} genus Stenella, since it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the Atlantic spotted dolphin (Stenella frontalis) than the common bottlenose.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} if the {{composition}} and appearance <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that of Saturn or Neptune. Based on its temperature, {{it should be a}} Sudarsky Class II planet, covered in water clouds.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the latest}} {{specimens}} found show partly different osteoderms including scutes on which the keel <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a thorn or spike. These specimens also seem to have little horns on the rear corners of the head, placed on the squamosal bones.|$|E

5000|$|Many of the {{properties}} of galaxies (including the galaxy color-magnitude diagram) indicate that there are fundamentally two types of galaxies. These groups divide into blue star-forming galaxies that <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> spiral types, and red non-star forming galaxies that <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> elliptical galaxies.|$|R
5|$|The above table {{reflects}} the hybrid nature of metalloids. The properties of form, appearance, and behaviour when mixed with metals <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> metals. Elasticity and general chemical behaviour <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> nonmetals. Electrical conductivity, band structure, ionization energy, electronegativity, and oxides are intermediate between the two.|$|R
5|$|The walrus's {{body shape}} shares {{features}} with both sea lions (eared seals: Otariidae) and seals (true seals: Phocidae). As with otariids, it can turn its rear flippers forward {{and move on}} all fours; however, its swimming technique <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> that of true seals, relying less on flippers and more on sinuous whole body movements. Also like phocids, it lacks external ears.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage in {{relatively}} shallow waters <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods {{are used by}} many animals. For example, self-decoration is employed by decorator crabs; mimesis by animals such as the leafy sea dragon; countershading by many fish including sharks; distraction with eyespots by many fish; active camouflage through ability to change colour rapidly in fish such as the flounder, and cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{brown creeper}} {{has never been}} {{recorded}} in Europe, but an autumn vagrant {{would be difficult to}} identify, since it would not be singing, and the American species' call is much like that of Eurasian treecreeper. In appearance, brown creeper <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> short-toed than Eurasian, but a vagrant might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E

5|$|Three main {{camouflage}} methods predominate in the oceans: transparency, reflection, and counterillumination. Transparency and reflectivity {{are most}} important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counterillumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres. Most animals of the open sea use {{at least one of}} these methods to camouflage themselves. Camouflage in relatively shallow waters <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by animals in many different groups. These methods of camouflage are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{system remains}} unchanged from Ridge Racer, the checkpoint and time limit system remain the same; {{running out of}} time ends the race and passing through checkpoints grants additional time, although the car drifting <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> Ridge Racer 2. The player drives using automatic transmission or manual transmission. Ridge Racer Revolution supports Namco's NeGcon controller, and adds a rear-view mirror when using the in-car view. The game consists of three courses: 'Novice', 'Intermediate' (also called 'Advanced'), and 'Expert', each having different sections opened, and incorporates modes from the original game; Race, against eleven opponents, and Time Trial, against one. Ridge Racer Revolution adds a mode: Free Run, in which there are no other cars and the player practises driving. There is no lap limit. How fast the cars run depends on which speed grade is used, selectable in Free Run, and can be unlocked for Race. It is not available in Time Trial. A new feature is the option to select the time of day in which the race takes place, although this is not available {{at the start of the}} game. Ridge Racer Revolution features a two-player link-up mode which allows the players access to the original Ridge Racers courses known as 'Special 1' and 'Special 2'. There are two modes in two-player link-up: Race, identical to its single-player counterpart, and Versus, where only the players race against each other. Versus features a handicap option, increasing the speed of the trailing car.|$|E

25|$|The brown {{treecreeper}} {{has never}} been recorded in Europe, but {{would be difficult to}} separate from the short-toed treecreeper, which it much resembles in appearance. Its call <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> the common treecreeper's, but a vagrant brown treecreeper might still not be possible to identify with certainty given the similarities between the three species.|$|E

25|$|International Sign, {{formerly}} known as Gestuno, is used mainly at international deaf {{events such as the}} Deaflympics and meetings of the World Federation of the Deaf.

25|$|Unlike the chant-like verses, the antiphon <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a short hymn-verse in {{a regular}} metre. The tempo of the antiphon is {{directly}} related to that of the verse: the one-beat-in-the-bar verse equals the beat unit, typically crotchet (quarter note) or dotted crotchet, of the antiphon. There should be no break between psalm and antiphon: each should follow the other without interruption.|$|E
