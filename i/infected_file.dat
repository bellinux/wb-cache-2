50|$|There is {{only one}} way to infect a {{computer}} with the Ada virus; by executing an <b>infected</b> <b>file.</b> The <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> may come from a variety of sources: floppy disks, files downloaded from the Internet, and infected networks.|$|E
50|$|Previewing an <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> in Windows Explorer.|$|E

5000|$|Sunday is a {{standard}} patched Jerusalem variant {{in the way it}} <b>infects</b> <b>files.</b> It is a directly modified version of the original Jerusalem.1803. It infects [...]EXE, [...]COM, and [...]OVL files. Like the original Jerusalem, <b>infected</b> <b>files</b> occasionally become corrupted.|$|R
5000|$|Ontario.512 is an {{encrypting}} DOS file infector. Upon {{the execution}} of an infected [...]COM, [...]EXE or [...]OVL file, Ontario.512 goes memory resident and <b>infects</b> <b>files</b> of these times upon being opened. COMMAND.COM is infected using a special routine. <b>Infected</b> <b>files</b> will increase either 512 bytes (COM files) or between 512 and 1,023 bytes (EXE and OVL files). Some systems with larger file sectors may display increases of greater than 1,023 bytes for <b>infected</b> <b>files</b> of these types.|$|R
5000|$|Ontario.1024 is an encrypting, stealth DOS file infector. Upon the {{execution}} of an infected [...]COM or [...]EXE file, Ontario.1024 goes memory resident and <b>infects</b> <b>files</b> of these types upon being opened. COMMAND.COM is infected using a special routine. <b>Infected</b> <b>files</b> will increase in size by 1,024 bytes. However, when Ontario.1024 is in memory, no increase in file size will be observed due to the virus' stealthing. Unlike Ontario.512, it will not <b>infect</b> [...]OVL <b>files.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Acid is a {{computer}} virus which infects [...]COM and [...]EXE files including command.com. Each time an <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> is executed, Acid infects all of the [...]EXE files in the current directory. Later, if an <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> is executed, it infects the [...]COM files in the current directory. Programs infected with Acid will have had the first 792 bytes of the host program overwritten with Acid's own code. There will be no file length increase unless the original host program was smaller than 792 bytes, in which case it will become 792 bytes in length. The program's date and time in the DOS disk directory listing will not be altered.|$|E
50|$|Westwood was {{an early}} variant of the Jerusalem virus, {{which was the first}} DOS file infector to become common. Upon {{execution}} of an <b>infected</b> <b>file,</b> Westwood becomes memory resident. Any file of COM, EXE, or OVL types is infected upon execution, except COMMAND.COM.|$|E
50|$|When an <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> is executed, an ASCII art {{ambulance}} {{can be seen}} {{moving across}} the screen, a siren starts to sound, and it displays an alert message such as: BOOM! It is not a deliberately destructive virus; it simply spreads itself around and shows off its payload once in a while.|$|E
50|$|<b>Infected</b> <b>files</b> {{will contain}} the {{seemingly}} meaningless hex string 5E8BDE909081C63200B912082E.|$|R
50|$|An {{increase}} in size of <b>infected</b> <b>files</b> by 2,048 bytes.|$|R
50|$|The virus causes <b>infected</b> <b>files</b> {{to grow by}} 1,508 bytes.|$|R
5000|$|While {{infected}} with the Ada virus, system memory measured by the DOS CHKDSK decreases by 21,296 bytes to 21,312 bytes. The virus will reside in the memory after an <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> is run and will infect any other [...]COM files executed on the computer. It will also hijack interrupts 08, 13 and 21.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "Spacefiller" [...] was {{introduced}} because most viruses write their code {{to the end}} of the <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> - however, CIH looks for gaps in the existing program code, where it then writes its own code. This does not increase the file size and in that way helps the virus avoid detection.|$|E
50|$|File infectors viruses {{are made}} to infect files of on the computer. File infectors spread once the user runs the <b>infected</b> <b>file.</b> The virus copies itself to {{locations}} on the computer {{where it can be}} executed; usually in RAM. The file infector will continue to infect files while granting the virus access to the infect files.|$|E
5000|$|Ontario.512 {{primarily}} only <b>infects</b> <b>files,</b> {{so there}} is no one significant symptom. The two main symptoms are: ...|$|R
5000|$|Ontario.2048 is an encrypting, polymorphic, stealth DOS file infector. Upon the {{execution}} of an infected [...]COM, [...]EXE, [...]OVL, or [...]SYS file, Ontario.2048 goes memory resident and <b>infects</b> <b>files</b> of these times upon being opened. COMMAND.COM is infected using a special routine, and will not increase in <b>file</b> size. <b>Infected</b> <b>files</b> will increase in size by 2,048 bytes. However, when Ontario.2048 is in memory, no increase in file size will be observed due to the virus' stealthing.|$|R
5000|$|Jerusalem-Yellow {{does not}} <b>infect</b> [...]EXE <b>files.</b> All <b>files</b> <b>infected</b> grow by 1,363 bytes apiece.|$|R
5000|$|While some {{antivirus}} software employ various techniques to counter stealth mechanisms, once the infection occurs any recourse to [...] "clean" [...] {{the system is}} unreliable. In Microsoft Windows operating systems, the NTFS file system is proprietary. This leaves {{antivirus software}} little alternative but to send a [...] "read" [...] request to Windows OS files that handle such requests. Some viruses trick antivirus software by intercepting its requests to the Operating system (OS). A virus can hide by intercepting the request to read the <b>infected</b> <b>file,</b> handling the request itself, and returning an uninfected version of the file to the antivirus software. The interception can occur by code injection of the actual operating system files that would handle the read request. Thus, an antivirus software attempting to detect the virus will either not be given permission to read the <b>infected</b> <b>file,</b> or, the [...] "read" [...] request will be served with the uninfected {{version of the same}} file.|$|E
5000|$|Sircam was notable {{during its}} {{outbreak}} {{for the way}} it distributed itself. Document files (usually [...]doc or [...]xls) on the infected computer were chosen at random, infected with the virus and emailed out to email addresses in the host's address book. Opening the <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> resulted in infection of the target computer. During the outbreak, many personal or private files were emailed to people who otherwise should not have received them.|$|E
50|$|ARCV-n is a {{term for}} a large family of viruses {{authored}} by the ARCV group through October - November 1992 and polymorphed with the PS-MPC virus generation tool (hence they are very similar). ARCV-n viruses seem to infect COM (perhaps command.com) and/or EXE files rapidly, but do not damage the compromised machine, instead displaying various text messages to the user. An <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> will have the ARCV-n virus appended {{to the end of}} it.|$|E
50|$|You {{can remove}} the virus from your {{computer}} with an antivirus program or by going into safe mode {{to remove the}} <b>infected</b> <b>files</b> manually.|$|R
5000|$|Seventh Son Virus - a {{computer}} virus affecting COM files, the words [...] "seventh {{son of a}} seventh son" [...] appear in <b>infected</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Solano 2000 is a {{standard}} DOS <b>file</b> infector. It <b>infects</b> [...]COM <b>files</b> and is memory resident. It will <b>infect</b> <b>files</b> as they are opened after an infected [...]COM is opened, until the virus is terminated, such as by a reboot. It is generally not a highly damaging infector, but can occasionally corrupt files.|$|R
5000|$|Alabama is {{a fairly}} {{standard}} file infector outside its odd behaviour of deciding what files to infect. When an <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> is executed, Alabama goes memory resident. Whenever a [...]EXE file is executed from this point on, Alabama will search out for another file to infect. This is probably intended to place blame on the file that is being executed instead of the virus itself. Files infected by Alabama increase in size by 1,560 bytes.|$|E
50|$|A mixed threat {{attack is}} an attack that uses {{different}} tactics to infiltrate a computer user's environment. A mixed threat attack might include an <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> that comes in by way of spam or can be received by way of Internet download. The mixed threat attacks generally try to exploit multiple vulnerabilities {{to get into a}} system. By launching multiple diverse attacks in parallel, the attacker can exploit more entry points than with just a single attack.|$|E
50|$|This {{synonymy}} is however incorrect. Although {{the aforementioned}} behavioral execution environment is the same, {{in both cases}} i.e. both malware variants are executed in system memory, the crucial differentiation is the method of inception and prolongation. Most malwareâ€™s infection vector involves some writing to the hard disk, in order {{for it to be}} executed, whose origin could take the form of an <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> attachment, external media device e.g. USB, peripheral, mobile phone etc., browser drive-by, side-channel etc.|$|E
50|$|MOVEit was {{released}} in 2002 by Standard Networks. In 2006, the company released integration between MOVEit and antivirus software to stop the transfer of <b>infected</b> <b>files.</b>|$|R
50|$|Quarantine is a {{function}} of antivirus software that isolates <b>infected</b> <b>files</b> on a computer's hard disk. Files put in quarantine are no longer capable of infecting their hosting system.|$|R
5000|$|Sality usually targets all {{files in}} drive C: that have [...]SCR or [...]EXE file extensions, {{beginning}} with the root folder. <b>Infected</b> <b>files</b> increase in size by a varying amount.|$|R
5000|$|Most modern {{antivirus}} programs {{try to find}} virus-patterns inside ordinary {{programs by}} scanning them for so-called virus signatures. Unfortunately, the term is misleading, in that viruses do not possess unique signatures {{in the way that}} human beings do. Such a virus [...] "signature" [...] is merely a sequence of bytes that an antivirus program looks for because it is known {{to be part of the}} virus. A better term would be [...] "search strings". Different antivirus programs will employ different search strings, and indeed different search methods, when identifying viruses. If a virus scanner finds such a pattern in a file, it will perform other checks to make sure that it has found the virus, and not merely a coincidental sequence in an innocent file, before it notifies the user that the file is infected. The user can then delete, or (in some cases) [...] "clean" [...] or [...] "heal" [...] the <b>infected</b> <b>file.</b> Some viruses employ techniques that make detection by means of signatures difficult but probably not impossible. These viruses modify their code on each infection. That is, each <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> contains a different variant of the virus.|$|E
5000|$|The casino {{computer}} virus is a malicious virus that upon running the <b>infected</b> <b>file,</b> copies the File Allocation Tables (FATs) to random-access memory (RAM), then deletes the FAT {{from the hard}} disk. It challenges the user to a game of Jackpot of which they have 5 credits to play with, hence the name. No matter if they win or lose, the computer shuts down, thereby making them have to reinstall their DOS. The message it shows when it challenges you read(s): ...|$|E
50|$|Upon execution, {{whether from}} an <b>infected</b> <b>file</b> or the Cholera dropper, CTX will {{check to see}} if its payload routine should {{activate}} (see Payload). If not, CTX will infect EXE files. CTX has a polymorphic nature, which is neither particularly simple or complex in nature. CTX also obscures the entry point of files to avoid detection. The virus avoids infecting more than five files in a given folder to avoid detection. Files infecting with CTX are padded to a multiple of 101 bytes to avoid re-infections.|$|E
50|$|For data {{integrity}} purposes, System Restore {{does not allow}} other applications or users to modify or delete files in the directory where the restore points are saved. On NTFS volumes, the Restore Points are protected using ACLs. Since its method of backup is fairly simplistic, it may end up archiving malware such as viruses, for example in a restore point created before using antivirus software to clean an infection. Antivirus software is usually unable to remove <b>infected</b> <b>files</b> from System Restore; the only way actually to delete the <b>infected</b> <b>files</b> is to disable System Restore, which will result in losing all saved restore points; otherwise they will remain until Windows deletes the affected restore points. However stored <b>infected</b> <b>files</b> in themselves are harmless unless executed; they will only pose a threat if the affected restore point is reinstated. Windows System Restore is not compatible with restore points made by third party applications.|$|R
5000|$|Sality <b>infects</b> <b>files</b> in the {{affected}} computer. Most variants use a DLL that is dropped once in each computer. The DLL file is written to disk in two forms, for example: ...|$|R
5000|$|Ada is {{a memory}} {{resident}} (stays {{in the memory}} of the computer it infects after the program it infected executes) virus that <b>infects</b> <b>files.</b> The Ada virus mainly targets [...]COM files, specifically COMMAND.COM.|$|R
