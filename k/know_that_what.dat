5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists as they come to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E
25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we got to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

What her character does, is not cheap." [...] As a reference point, he also asked Balan to study 'similar themed' films such as Burlesque and Chicago. Balan also underwent salsa training to fine-tune herself with Smitha's languid body language.|$|E
500|$|On May 4, Cooper, in {{his last}} public statement, said, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> is {{happening}} is God's will. I am {{not afraid of the}} future." [...] He received the last rites on May 12. Cooper died quietly the following day, Saturday, May 13, 1961, at 12:47 pm, six days after his sixtieth birthday. A requiem mass was held on May 18 at the Church of the Good Shepherd, attended by many of Cooper's friends, including James Stewart, Henry Hathaway, Joel McCrea, Audrey Hepburn, Jack L. Warner, John Ford, John Wayne, Edward G. Robinson, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Randolph Scott, Walter Pidgeon, Bob Hope and Marlene Dietrich. Cooper was buried in the Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. In May 1974, after his family relocated to New York, Cooper's remains were exhumed and reburied in Sacred Hearts Cemetery in Southampton. His grave is marked by a three-ton boulder from a Montauk quarry.|$|E
500|$|A {{pneumatic}} value {{failure in}} the preceding race, the United States Grand Prix, had forced Häkkinen to retire from the Grand Prix. With two races of the season remaining and an eight-point deficit after losing {{the lead in the}} Drivers' Championship, Häkkinen remained confident about his title chances: [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> happened to me in the last Grand Prix, when I had to retire, can happen to anyone, It could happen to Michael. So I am very optimistic. I have come here prepared and thinking about these two races together. Not one, two." [...] Michael Schumacher emphasised the pressure of leading the championship going into Japan: [...] "It hasn't been a relaxing time at all and I still haven't completely got over the jetlag from the States. But I'm prepared to sacrifice this and a lot more to bring the title back to Maranello. And {{the same can be said}} of the entire team." [...] Ferrari team principal Jean Todt and former World Champion Jody Scheckter called for Barrichello and Coulthard to race fairly as both drivers were ordered by their teams to assist their teammates in the Championship battle.|$|E

2500|$|On June 16, 2010, Bishop {{was charged}} with first degree murder in her brother's death, nearly 24 years after his shooting. Keating commented, [...] "I can't give you any explanations, I can't give you excuses, because there are none. Jobs weren't done, {{responsibilities}} weren't met and justice wasn't served." [...] Bishop's parents, who claim that the Braintree officers lied about the events at the station, issued a statement after the indictment. They wrote, [...] "We cannot explain or even understand what happened in Alabama. However, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> happened 23 years ago to our son, Seth, was an accident." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scope - A {{practical}} {{issue is}} whether {{the fact that an}} accused is labouring under a [...] "mental disability" [...] should be a necessary but not sufficient condition for negating responsibility i.e. whether the test should also require an incapacity to understand what is being done, to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> one is doing is wrong, or to control an impulse to do something and so demonstrate a causal link between the disability and the potentially criminal acts and omissions. For example, the Irish insanity defence comprises the M'Naghten Rules and a control test that asks whether the accused was debarred from refraining from committing the act because of a defect of reason due to mental illness (see Doyle v Wicklow County Council 1974) 55 IR 71. The Butler Committee recommended that proof of severe mental disorder should be sufficient to negate responsibility, in effect creating an irrebuttable presumption of irresponsibility arising from proof of a severe mental disorder. This has been criticized as it assumes a lack of criminal responsibility simply because there is evidence of some sort of mental dysfunction, rather than establishing a standard of criminal responsibility. According to this view, the law should be geared to culpability not mere psychiatric diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Combat {{operations}} on Bougainville {{ended with the}} surrender of Japanese forces on Bougainville on 21 August 1945. [...] The Empire surrendered in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. The last phase of the campaign saw 516 Australians killed and another 1,572wounded. 8,500Japanese were killed at the same time, while disease and malnutrition killed another 9,800 and some 23,500troops and labourers surrendered {{at the end of}} the war. Of the casualties suffered during the second phase of the campaign, historian Harry Gailey wrote: [...] "it was a terrible toll for an island whose possession after March 1944 was of no consequence in bringing the war to a close ... That the Australian soldiers performed so well when they had to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> they were doing was in the larger sphere unnecessary and unappreciated at home says much for the courage and the discipline of the ordinary Australian infantryman". In contrast, Australian historian Karl James has argued that the 194445 Bougainville campaign was justifiable given that it could not be known at the time that Japan would surrender in August 1945, and there was a need to both free up Australian forces for operations elsewhere and liberate the island's civilian population. Of the civilian population, according to James it is estimated that potentially up to 13,000 of the pre-war population of 52,000 died during the war.|$|E
