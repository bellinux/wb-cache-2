40|$|If the EU {{stands alone}} in {{adopting}} climate policy and imposes a strict emissions ceiling, competitiveness of EU energy-intensive sectors {{will be affected}} negatively. Relocation of EU energy-intensive firms to countries with a lax regime also leads to carbon leakage. However, when use is made of the opportunities of the Clean Development Mechanism these impacts are very modest. Border tax adjustments (BTAs) to ‘level the playing field’ between domestic and foreign producers may be considered to address the concerns about both competitiveness and carbon leakage. It {{is far from clear}} whether these measures are WTO-proof. Simulations show that both an import levy and an <b>export</b> <b>refund</b> restore competitiveness to a certain extent. BTAs may lower the costs for energy-intensive sectors, but induce higher costs for other sectors.

40|$|The usual sale of European {{agricultural}} products to Africa using export refunds has been heavily discussed in recent decades. At {{the centre of}} the discussion are the consequences on the agricultural producers in Western and Southern Africa. There are two different points of view: On the one hand, the European Union's (EU) export policy reduces the prices on these markets and relieves high burdens on local producers; on the other hand are claims that refunds do not influence local prices significantly. Hence, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has no effect on markets of third countries, besides depressing world market prices. This paper focuses on the effects of EU's export subsidies for beef exports on its market share in several developing countries. Twenty-seven African countries were analysed using a fixed-effects model between 1988 and 2000. The results clearly show a highly significant positive impact of the <b>export</b> <b>refund</b> rate on the market and the import share. With its export policy, the EU raises its market position and edges out other competitors...|$|E
40|$|During 1996 - 2000, U. S. {{imports of}} milk protein {{concentrate}} (MPC) increased rapidly. At the same time, Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) stocks of non-fat dry milk (NFDM) went from nothing {{to more than}} 500 million pounds. Consequently, U. S. milk producers attributed low milk prices and dairy farmer income during this period to the increased imports of MPC. U. S. milk producers were especially concerned with MPC imports for two reasons. First, MPC between 40 and 90 percent protein had been classified in subheading 0404. 90. 10 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). Thus, MPC was {{not subject to the}} tariff-rate quotas applied to many other dairy products. Second, MPC produced in the European Union (EU) and exported to the United States was eligible for production and export subsidies. Along with the high U. S. internal milk protein prices maintained by the Dairy Price Support Program, and volatile world prices of NFDM, these policies created economic rents for trade in MPC between the European Union and the United States. To test the relationship between these policies and U. S. imports of MPC, these economic rents, which were not directly observable, were estimated by combing a set of identifiable variables: (1) the CCC purchase price, (2) the EU <b>export</b> <b>refund,</b> (3) EU casein production aid, and (4) the world price of NFDM as expressed by the Western Europe export price. A vector autoregression model was then estimated using monthly U. S. imports of MPC and the estimate of economic rents. This estimation showed that nearly 40 percent of the variability in U. S. MPC imports was attributable to the estimate of economic rents. These results demonstrate that U. S. and EU policies can not be analyzed in isolation when evaluating the impact of dairy policies on U. S. MPC imports. Agricultural and Food Policy, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E

40|$|Reports {{from the}} USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) suggest that EU beef {{production}} will be lower in 2003 {{as a result}} of a reduction in both the dairy and beef herds. However, EU beef exports are expected to increase as import restrictions arising from animal disease problems in the EU are lifted. Sales from intervention stocks are likely to continue into 2003. Some beef bought in under the 'special purchase scheme' has already been sent abroad as food aid (to North Korea). It is expected that the market effects of the BSE crisis will continue to fade in 2003 with implications for poultry and pork consumption in the EU. Beef prices in some EU countries have returned to pre-BSE levels. In the long term, however, beef consumption is expected to decline as consumers in France and the UK switch to other meats. Germany, Spain, Ireland and Italy could, however, see some marginal increase in beef consumption. In budgetary terms EU expenditure in the meat sector is expected to grow {{as a result of}} higher <b>export</b> <b>refund</b> allocations to make EU meat exports price competitive, and increased direct aid premiums arising form the Agenda 2000 reforms. A noticeable trend in the EU market is the increased availability of both in-quota and out-of-quota beef imports from South America. The USDA suggests that having gained market share, imports of less expensive South American beef could increase still further in the future. Comment: The growth in less expensive Latin American beef exports could put pressure on ACP beef suppliers, particularly as EU market prices fall in response to further rounds of beef-sector reform.

40|$|In our communication, we give a {{detailed}} analysis {{on the results of}} the EU accession of the Hungarian wine sector, while {{it is one of the}} significant wine producers of New Member States, and we have nearly three years experience of application of the CMO-wine. We show what was expected by the actors of the Hungarian wine industry from this accession. For this reason, we analyze deep interviews made in 2003 with several represents of the wine enterprises and the represents of the professional organizations before the entry to the EU. Then we examine the implementation of the CMO-wine at the level of the national regulation and we analyzed the available statistics (sources: KSH, HNT, MVH) in relation of the measures of the CMO-wine applied in the wine sector, and its effect on the Hungarian wine economy. After that, we study the effect of the EU accession to the Hungarian wine exchange, the wine export and import of the recent period. Finally, we touch upon the probable influence of the actual version of the CMO-wine reform on the Hungarian wine industry. Our study underlines that the operators of the Hungarian wine sector expected a foreseeable and relatively stable regulation system of wine production or wine markets and therefore they projected a rather stable subvention system. Among the CMO-wine measures, for Hungary, the primary is the restructuring and re-conversion of vineyards, but we examine the exploitation of the other CMO-measures like the distillations, the private storage, the aid for musts usage and the <b>export</b> <b>refund</b> for wine exportation into third countries. Then we analyze the tendency of wine export after the EU accession, which reduced drastically during the recent period for the reason that the concurrence is more and more intensive at the international markets and the cause for the lack of marketing investments. At the same time, the structure of wine import has changed. Its volume rests still marginal, but it shows an increasing tendency, particularly in the category of the bottled wine with favourable quality/price rate, which means a direct concurrence for the Hungarian quality wines in the super-, hypermarket and hard discount chains.

40|$|The {{research}} conducted under the projects 4821 and 4823 represents {{a continuation of}} project 4345, which has developed economic models of the Irish crops sector, agricultural inputs and incomes. These models are integrated within the FAPRI-Ireland model of the agricultural sector which is a joint undertaking between the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute (FAPRI) 1 and Teagasc. The crops model links to other Irish commodity models and an Irish inputs model to generate an income figure for Irish agriculture which is then projected forward on a 10 year basis. In this research, the models were used to produce projections for the Irish crop sector, inputs and incomes for the period 2000 - 2010. These projections were generated under three policy scenarios. First, the models were run assuming that agricultural policy would remain unchanged throughout the projection period. Subsequently, these “baseline” projections were compared with projections generated assuming alternative policy scenarios. In 2001, the baseline was compared with the policy scenario of reduced or eliminated export subsidies. This scenario was designed to reflect possible changes in trade policy resulting from the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Millennium Round negotiations. In 2002, the baseline projections (now modified to include the policy changes that occurred in 2001) were compared with projections under a policy scenario which included further extensification of livestock production. This scenario {{was designed as a}} second guess to the policy reform proposals under the Mid-Term review (MTR) of the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which became available in July 20022. The general objective is to generate projections for the Irish: 1. crop sector 2. agricultural inputs 3. agricultural incomes. The projections are generated under the existing policy framework as well as under alternative policy scenarios. Subsequently, the quantitative effect of each scenario is then gauged. The crops, inputs and incomes models are components of the FAPRI-Ireland modelling system developed to generate projections and conduct policy analysis for the Irish agricultural sector. The modelling framework consists of a system of econometrically estimated equations and linkages between agricultural variables across commodity sectors. Through the collaboration with FAPRI, models are also linked with their EU and world agricultural models. Therefore, in generating projections the following is ensured: • the projections of agricultural outputs in Ireland are generated taking formal account of international market developments, and • the most relevant policy levers associated with the CAP are fully incorporated within the projections. In 2001, the projections for Irish crops, inputs and incomes were generated under two policy scenarios. First, it was assumed {{that there would be no}} change in agricultural policy over the projection period. Second, the analysis included the effect of both a reduction in <b>export</b> <b>refund</b> limits and an elimination of export refunds. Under the 2001 baseline, Irish grain prices are projected to decrease in nominal terms over the period 2000 - 2010. The value of wheat output is projected to increase, while the value of barley output is set to decrease. The demand for inputs is projected to decline reflecting the reduced intensity of agricultural production. In aggregate terms it is projected that there would be little change in overall agricultural income. An export subsidy reduction would lead to a decline in grain prices relative to the baseline. This reduction would be more pronounced if export refunds were eliminated. While, agricultural income is not largely affected by the reduction in export subsidies, the elimination of refunds, leads to the reduction of 20 percent in income relative to the baseline projections. In 2002, projections, covering the period 2001 - 2010, were generated for a revised baseline and a policy scenario which included further extensification of livestock production. In general, the revised baseline projections are not significantly different from the baseline 2001. The extensification of livestock production is projected to lead to a reduction in inputs consumed, including feed, energy and fertiliser application. Under this scenario the Irish agricultural income in 2010 increases relative to the baseline projection, primarily due to the increase in the extensification payments. End of Project Repor...|$|E

40|$|In April the European Commission {{adopted a}} {{recommendation}} for Council Decision encompassing draft directives for {{the negotiation of}} economic partnership agreements with ACP countries. These draft negotiating directives are now under discussion with EU member States, primarily {{under the auspices of}} the Article 133 Committee, which deals with external trade relations of the EU. The explanatory memorandum to the recommendation for a Council Decision dealt with: the relationship of economic partnership agreement negotiations to the wider objectives of the Cotonou Agreement; the proposed content of economic partnership agreements; the principles which should guide the establishment of economic partnership agreements; the relationship to WTO rules; the need to support regional market integration amongst ACP countries; how the concept of differentiation is to be applied, particularly with reference to least developed countries; the overall objectives of economic partnership agreements both with reference to trade relations and the wider economic and social development of ACP countries. The draft negotiating directives set out: the relationship to the Cotonou Agreement; the proposed scope of economic partnership agreements; how negotiations on trade in goods are to be dealt with; the scope and how negotiations on trade in services are to be dealt with; the scope of negotiations on trade related areas; how payments and capital movements are to be dealt with; the institutional framework for negotiations; the structure and organisation of negotiations. Overall the most important points are that: EPAs are to be subject to the wider development objectives of the Cotonou Agreement; the various EPAs to be negotiated are to be as similar as possible; the main aim of EPAs is to establish 'a stable, predictable and transparent framework for economic and trade relations between the ACP countries and the EU'; EPAs will involve 'progressively eliminating tariffs and non-tariff barriers'; the European Commission recognised that adjustment costs would be faced but felt that the necessary flanking measures could be financed from existing EDF instruments; the trade in goods provisions of EPAs should by in conformity with Article XXIV of GATT; the trade in services provision of EPAs should conform with the provisions of GATT; the provisions of EPSs on trade related areas (investment, public procurement, standards and data protection) should be consistent with WTO provisions; regional market integration should be supported; the concept of differentiation does not imply LDCs would retain their rights to non-reciprocal trade preferences. LDCs would be expected to waive their right to continued non-reciprocal preferences under any region to region EPAs; regional based EPA negotiations should begin no later than January 2003. Comment: With specific regard to the agricultural sector a number of significant points emerged. The agricultural sector (and associated downstream value added product industries) is the major area where the EU retains market access restrictions. Here the Commission's final draft mandate is less forthcoming on issues of market access than the preliminary draft mandate. Initially the Commission proposed that: 'the Community should grant duty free access to its markets to all products originating in the ACP countries, as from entry into force of EPAs. ' In the final Commission-approved draft, the commitment on market access for ACP countries is restricted to an expression of belief that: 'The Community should further improve current access to its markets for products originating in the ACP countries'. This is believed to be the result of pressure from DG Agriculture which is fearful that the process of CAP reform will not be completed by 2008 and that, as a consequence, opening up the agricultural sector to all ACP exports by 2008 could create problems for EU agriculture. Significantly, in section 3. 2 of the actual Directives annexed to the recommendation for a Council Decision, while talking about how: 'EPAs shall build upon and further enhance the market access conditions currently provided under the Cotonou Agreement' for ACP countries this is only to be 'fixed in the course of the negotiations'. Overall the Commission's final mandate appears to take a much harder line on market access than the initial draft, with the view being expressed that: 'trade liberalisation in favour of developing countries should be part of a new North-South partnership according to which these countries apply the appropriate policies'. Clearly, within this Commission approach, further opening up of the EU market is to be made conditional on ACP countries applying these 'appropriate policies'. There would appear to be an urgent need for the EU Council of Ministers to reinstate the Commission's initially proposed commitment to 'grant duty free access to its markets to all products originating in the ACP countries, as from entry into force of EPAs. ' This would provide a more solid basis for investment in the value added food product industries of ACP countries. This could bring real benefits to ACP countries in the context of their participation in the larger integrated economic area centred on the EU which EPAs are designed to bring about. From an agricultural perspective a further important area of the EU's negotiating instructions is the requirement for ACP countries to open up their economies to duty free imports from the EU. This needs to be seen in the context of the reform of the CAP which, on the basis of increased levels of direct aid payments to EU farmers, is making EU exports of basic agricultural products and value added food products more price competitive on overseas markets. Significantly the Commission draft negotiating directives make no provision for discussion of the external effects of CAP reform on ACP countries. This is a major shortcoming in the negotiating instructions from an ACP perspective. The only provision made is for 'appropriate flexibility... in the product coverage and the calendar rhythm of liberalisation commitments'. This being said, provision is made for safeguard provisions building on Article 8 of Annex V of the Cotonou Agreement. Anti-dumping measures are also to be allowed in accordance with GATT/WTO rules. Currently the only reference made to CAP distortions is in section 3. 2 of the negotiating directives which states: 'In this context the parties will examine on a case by case basis, the potential impact of <b>export</b> <b>refund</b> mechanisms on the process of trade liberalisation. ' Given the importance of agricultural trade (36 % ACP exports to the EU) to the ACP group, and the significance of agriculture within the production structures of many ACP economies, this oversight is potentially disastrous. The common agricultural policy is being reformed to enhance the competitiveness of EU agricultural and value added food product industries on national and international markets. This will undoubtedly have an impact on the market conditions facing ACP producers of similar or competing products. ACP and EU parliamentarians (see next item) have called for a comprehensive assessment of the likely implications for ACP countries of CAP reform. They say that future trade arrangements should be designed to: 'fully take into account the impact of the internal process of reform of the common agricultural policy on ACP countries and seek to minimise adverse effects on the development of agro-based value added processing activities in ACP countries. ' Clearly the importance of the external effects of a reformed CAP on the development of ACP-EU trade relations and ACP economies, needs to be recognised. Provision should be made within the European Commission's directives for these issues to be addressed during economic partnership agreement negotiations.

40|$|European Union (EU) {{consumers}} pay {{almost twice}} the competitive world price for many agricultural products. Agricultural subsidies accounted {{for almost half}} of the EU's total budget (US$ 40 billion on agriculture in 2000) although agriculture represented 1. 7 percent of the EU's GDP and employs 4. 3 % of the EU's population.

40|$|Proposals for the EU's {{agricultural}} {{offer in}} the WTO negotiations were {{submitted by the}} European Commission to EU agricultural ministers and the Article 133 Committee on December 16 th 2002. The EU proposal suggests the following actions be taken over a six-year period for developed countries and a ten-year period for developing countries: a 55 % cut in trade-distorting farm subsidies; the rolling back of budget expenditures on <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> by about 45 % on average with the complete dismantling of <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> on cereals oilseeds, olive oil and tobacco, provided that all other forms of export subsidy are also abandoned for these products (in this context the EU is calling for stronger disciplines to be introduced on export credits, state-run trading enterprises and abuses of food aid); a further opening of agricultural markets by reducing agricultural tariffs by 36 % on average, with a cut of at least 15 % per dutiable item. In addition the EU is proposing that: other developed economies and advanced developing countries should introduce 'Everything but Arms' style treatment for LDCS; there should be support for a 'food security box' involving a special safeguard instrument to ensure food security; there should be recognition of its right to protect the European model of agriculture and the EU position on geographical designations of origin. Securing support for the European model of agriculture includes securing acceptance of the exclusion of internal non trade-distorting rural development support measures from the support reduction commitments. It also involves {{an extension of the}} peace clause, which prevents existing support measures from being challenged in the WTO. The EU sees its proposals as a more practical way of moving the agenda forward rather than the 'extreme and unrealistic position' of the USA and the Cairns Group. In response to the EU proposals the Cairns Group felt that they contravened the Doha commitment to 'reductions of, with a view to phasing out' all forms of export subsidies. The Group also pointed out that the EU make no proposals for phasing out the 'blue box', which allows partly de-coupled payments under production limiting programmes. The Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile described the EU offer as 'too little too late'. The US described the EU proposal as 'lacking ambition'. Comment: All of the major elements of the EU proposal demand careful scrutiny. For example what is meant by 'trade-distorting subsidies'? The OECD has raised questions as to whether all of the subsidies which the EU describes as non trade-distorting are in fact trade neutral. Second, the EU's commitments on <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> needs to be seen against the background of the shift to direct aid payments which is allowing the gap between EU and world market prices to be closed. This is doing away with the need for <b>export</b> <b>refunds.</b> During the first round of reform EU export-refund expenditures fell by 45 %. Further reductions in the EU intervention price under the Agenda 2000 reforms have further closed the gap between EU and world market prices. The depreciation of the Euro against the US$ further reduced the need for <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> (although the recent 10 % appreciation has increased the objective need for <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> in the last year). It will require detailed calculations based on current price trends and expected exchange rates to determine whether the EU's offer will have any actual impact on the planned level of export-refund expenditures in the coming years Third, the EU's offer to reduce agricultural tariffs by 36 % on average cannot be considered in isolation from the downward trend in EU agricultural market prices driven by the process of CAP reform. With the gap between EU and world market prices closing, the need for tariff protection is diminishing. Here again a detailed consideration of market prices and expected exchange rates is necessary in order to ascertain whether the EU's offer will have any material impact on the agricultural trade position of developing countries. It is possible that the EU is in fact offering very little more than the current trajectory of CAP reform will easily allow, whilst securing benefits in terms of wider recognition of the EU's right to make use of certain support instruments and to secure exclusive use for EU enterprises of some widely recognised geographical labels.

Comment: In response to this initiative the ACP Group could usefully put together a dossier of specific market-access improvements which ACP states have been seeking under Declaration XXII and other agricultural trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement.

In turn, it was expected that the enhanced returns from these commodities would be transmitted to the farm gate price for milk. This aim was mainly achieved by purchasing to intervention stores, setting production quotas, <b>export</b> <b>refunds,</b> import tariffs and subsidized consumption. These measures resulted in isolating EU dairy commodity prices from lower and more volatile World prices. However, more recent changes to the CAP, and in particular the Luxembourg 2003 agreement, resulted in a greater market orientation with a lower level of price support (intervention buying, 9 import tariffs and <b>export</b> <b>refunds)</b> for EU dairy commodities. To compensate for the resultant losses, the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) was introduced to provide income support at farm level. In addition, the supply quota, introduced in 1984, expired in 2015. This aim of bringing EU dairy prices more in line with World prices was observed in O’Connor and Keane (2011) who reported a convergence of volatility between EU and World dairy commodity prices. A more comprehensive discussion of the CAP policy changes can be found in Keane and O’ Connor (2015).|$|R
40|$|In September 2003 the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service {{released}} its {{annual review of}} the EU poultry sector. According to this report the EU poultry market is now stable after recovery from the avian flu outbreak. <b>Export</b> <b>refunds</b> were introduced for turkey meat to all destinations except the USA and Estonia, {{but there were no}} changes to <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> for other poultry meat. Changes in the market are expected in response to 'the January 2003 announcement by Russia of its tariff-rate quota, which is expected to limit imports of beef, pork and poultry' and in the longer term the implementation of the CAP mid-term review proposals and EU enlargement. Comment: The Russian decision to limit imports of beef, poultry and pork through a TRQ system could leave considerable volumes of EU poultry meat looking for new markets. The impact this could have on ACP poultry sectors, particularly in west and central Africa will be determined by {{the extent to which these}} markets can directly replace former Russian markets. Already in west Africa there are growing complaints over increased EU poultry exports, which have arisen on the back of EU cereals-sector reform (which has substantially reduced EU poultry production costs). The openness of many west African and central African markets to poultry meat exports from the EU may spell severe problems for local poultry producers in a context of reduced EU exports to Russia. In September 2003 the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service [...] ...|$|R
30|$|The European Union policy {{interventions}} {{have included}} {{a range of}} incentives including consumption subsidies, intervention prices, price floors, <b>export</b> <b>refunds,</b> import tariffs, quotas for food products, precautionary savings and crop insurance subsidies (Jongeneel et al. 2010; ECPA 2013). One of {{the objectives of the}} Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), as provided by Article 39 in the 1957 Treaty of Rome, is “to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture”. Food market stabilisation has been identified as a key to reaching these goals of CAP (ECPA 2013). The CAP expenditures now account for approximately 40 % of the European Union budget (European Commission 2016).|$|R
40|$|One of the {{disciplines}} for State Trading Enterprises (STEs), {{with respect to}} the WTO, is the requirement to notify the WTO of all endeavors that fit the definition of an STE. This study argues that the European UnionÂ’'s system of grain interventions and <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> fits the WTO'Â’s definition of an STE. First, a system of agencies that work together for a common purpose can be considered to be an enterprise. Second, the constituents of EuropeÂ’'s grain intervention enterprise receive exclusive and special rights to export grain. Third, the grain intervention system has decisive voice over the timing, quantity and destination of exports. For these reasons the system should be notified to the WTO as an STE.

40|$|Determination of sex {{origin of}} cattle meat by fast and {{reliable}} molecular methods {{is an important}} measure to ensure correct allocation of <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> particularly in European countries and also female cattle (cow) slaughter is legally banned in India because of religious beliefs. Based on the DEAD box protein gene located on the X and Y chromosomes, 2 pair of primers were designed and the system of PCR was optimized. Upon PCR amplification, male tissue showed 2 bands, while female tissue resulted in only one band. The accuracy and specificity of the primers was assessed using DNA template extracted from cattle meat of known sex. The protocol was subjected to a blind test and showed 100 % concordance, proving its accuracy and reliability...|$|R
40|$|Addressing the EU Agricultural Council in September 2002 Commissioner Fischler {{pointed out}} that the Commission's {{intention}} was to maintain exports without being reliant upon <b>export</b> <b>refunds.</b> In this context he suggested that the EU would be 'well advised to move a further 5 % on the intervention price. This will obviously improve our competitive position on both external and internal markets'. He suggested that this would need to be implemented carefully to 'ensure that our external tariff protection works'. Comment: This final 5 % reduction will complete the process of cereals-sector reform. Currently reports from southern Africa suggest that French wheat traders are offering wheat for sale at 20 % below the world market price. A further shift towards direct aid payments will entrench this market distortion. Addressing the EU Agricultural Council in [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{agreement}} on {{enlargement of the}} EU involves a financial package amounting to € 5. 1 billion for the ten new members between 2004 and 2006. Direct aid payments to farmers in new member states will be phased in as follows: 25 % of the full EU rate in 2004, 30 % in 2005, 35 % in 2006. This level may be topped up from 30 % to 55 % in 2004, 60 % in 2005 and 65 % in 2006 from the new member states' own rural development funds, which will be financed separately. Farmers in new EU member states will also benefit from EU wide measures such as <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> and financing under the Structural Fund.

40|$|In {{the last}} years the usual {{clearance}} of the European agricultural market {{with the use of}} <b>export</b> <b>refunds</b> was heavily discussed. The consequences for the agricultural producers in West and southern Africa are in the centre of interest. There are two opposed points of view: One arguing that the European Unions (EU) export policy reduces the prices on these markets and relieves high burden on local producers. Contrary, the other position claims that refunds do not influence local prices. This study focuses on the effects of subventions of beef export on EU market share. A Fixed Effects and a Random Effects model for 26 African countries during the period 1988 - 1999 is used. The results clearly show a highly significant positive impact of refund rate. With its export policy the EU rises its market share and edges out other competitors...|$|R
