5|$|Caching is {{inhibited}} by {{the presence}} of Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) and grey jays from adjacent territories, which follow resident grey jays to steal cached food. Grey jays carry large food <b>items</b> <b>to</b> distant cache sites for storage more often than small food <b>items.</b> <b>To</b> prevent theft, they also tend to carry valuable food items further from the source when caching in the company of one or more grey jays. Scatterhoarding discourages pilferage by competitors, while increased cache density leads to increased thievery. In southern portions of the grey jay's range, food is not cached during summer because of the chance of spoilage and the reduced need for winter stores.|$|E
5|$|Additions to the {{gameplay}} include Xbox Live achievements, online cooperative gameplay, {{and hidden}} content: video terminals that provide additional plot information, and collectible skulls that modify gameplay when activated. Support for Xbox Kinect includes voice commands for video navigation, in-combat directives, and environment-scanning, which adds on-screen <b>items</b> <b>to</b> an encyclopedia called the Library.|$|E
5|$|Also nearby was the Shoemaker family, which owned {{substantial}} {{tracts of}} land in both the District and in Maryland. Three forts or portions of forts were built on their property: Fort Simmons, Fort Mansfield, and Battery Bailey. Despite the loss of much of their land, the Shoemaker family continued to operate a local general store and sold various sundry <b>items</b> <b>to</b> the garrison at Fort Bayard.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{of several}} sites in Tamil Nadu and Kerala have yielded remnants from the Sangam era, such as {{different kinds of}} pottery, pottery with inscriptions, imported ceramic ware, industrial objects, brick structures and spinning whorls. Techniques such as stratigraphy and paleography have helped establish the date of these <b>items</b> <b>to</b> the Sangam era. The excavated artifacts have provided evidence for existence of different economic activities mentioned in Sangam literature such as agriculture, weaving, smithy, gem cutting, building construction, pearl fishing and painting.|$|E
5|$|At Springfield Elementary School, Superintendent Chalmers visits Principal Skinner to {{show off}} his newly {{purchased}} 1979 Honda Accord. However, he becomes distraught when he discovers the car's hood ornament is missing. Principal Skinner orders a search of every student's locker, and it is discovered that Nelson Muntz is the culprit. As punishment, Nelson is forced to return all stolen <b>items</b> <b>to</b> their owners and is sentenced to be a janitor alongside Groundskeeper Willie.|$|E
5|$|Casual games can {{be played}} with only minimal equipment– a basic game {{can be played}} on almost any open area of {{reasonable}} size with just a ball and <b>items</b> <b>to</b> mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{describe}} {{a number of}} Caligula's other desperate measures. In order to gain funds, Caligula asked the public to lend the state money. He levied taxes on lawsuits, weddings and prostitution. Caligula began auctioning {{the lives of the}} gladiators at shows. Wills that left <b>items</b> <b>to</b> Tiberius were reinterpreted to leave the items instead to Caligula. Centurions who had acquired property by plunder were forced to turn over spoils to the state.|$|E
5|$|In {{his last}} will, which he signed January 22, 1868, Pierce left {{a large number}} of {{specific}} bequests such as paintings, swords, horses, and other <b>items</b> <b>to</b> friends, family, and neighbors. Much of his $72,000 estate (equal to $ today) went to his brother Henry's family, and to Hawthorne's children and Pierce's landlady. Henry's son Frank Pierce received the largest share.|$|E
5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} including pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and radix sort {{are widely}} used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 or fewer bits per word. Many such algorithms are known, with performance depending {{on a combination of}} the number of <b>items</b> <b>to</b> be sorted, number of bits per key, and number of bits per word of the computer performing the sorting algorithm.|$|E

Pearl is employed as an assistant at Grandma's Apron, a store for elderly residents {{on the ground floor}} of the shopping center. Beatrice, her boss at Grandma's Apron, is voiced by actress Betty White.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{were less}} enthused about the game's user interface, {{and found that}} many {{gameplay}} details went unexplained. IGN's Jose Otero found the inventory management system, which lacks {{an easy way to}} sort <b>items,</b> <b>to</b> be problematic. Chris Carter from Destructoid noted that the game's intricacies are described in messages on the in-game phone, which he considered difficult to navigate and read, and that the messages were often insufficiently clear and detailed.|$|E
5|$|Sales are {{primarily}} derived from branded ice cream parlors, quick-serve restaurants, {{and the distribution}} of its pre-packaged <b>items</b> <b>to</b> convenience stores, food service operators such as schools, hospitals, prisons, military installations, sports stadiums, amusement parks, and assisted living centers. Pre-packaged items are also sold in regional supermarkets, but this accounts for a minority of the company's sales.|$|E

A trade in selling local <b>items</b> <b>to</b> visiting foreigners soon developed. Crystals collected from across the massif were much in demand, as were locally produced goods such as horn trinkets and honey.|$|E
5|$|The feature {{extraction}} using speeded up robust features (SURF) is {{also able to}} perform the inspection of certain elements having two possible states, such as pitot probes or static ports being covered or not covered. A pairing is performed between images of the element to be inspected in different states and that present on the scene. For these simple <b>items</b> <b>to</b> be inspected, an analysis during navigation is possible and preferable due to its time saving.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} several recipes, each listing preparation times, {{ingredients and}} courses.

5|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} surrounding the Greek and Italian governments' claim that {{objects in the}} collection were looted and should be repatriated. In 2006, the Getty returned or promised to return four looted objects to Greece: a stele (grave marker), a marble relief, a gold funerary wreath, and a marble statue. In 2007, the Getty signed an agreement to return 40 looted <b>items</b> <b>to</b> Italy.|$|E
5|$|After Delfina {{moved through}} Mozambique, the local Red Cross chapter {{provided}} shelter, water, and relief <b>items</b> <b>to</b> the affected residents. Residual flooding in northern Mozambique, compounded with lack of drinking water, caused a cholera outbreak that affected at least 400people. By January27, 12people {{had died from}} the disease. Flooding also caused a malaria outbreak that killed 45people in the country. Government officials deployed food to the affected areas by airplane and by road, after workers repaired damaged bridges. Residents in Mozambique gradually recovered from storm damage {{in the weeks after}} it struck. Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas.|$|E
