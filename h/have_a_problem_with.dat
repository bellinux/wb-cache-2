5|$|The Old Bridge was so steep {{that horse}} carts had {{difficulty}} crossing it. By 1857, a new bridge, the Victoria Bridge, was built {{next to the}} Old Bridge, which was {{paid for by the}} people of Pontypridd. The Victoria Bridge is a three-arch bridge, built by Thomas Jenkins, that did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> roadway steepness.|$|E
5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The effects can be temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have liked}} finding contradictions; a common complaint, however, is the games' linearity, {{as well as}} how the player {{sometimes}} has to resort to a trial-and-error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order. Some reviewers have criticized the lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series, while some have said that fans of the series would not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> this.|$|E

5|$|Declan {{begins to}} spend time with Bridget Parker and they go joyriding together. Bridget is banned from seeing him after they are pursued by the police, but she sneaks out to meet Declan. They argue and Bridget leaves. She is then hit by a car and is paralysed down one side of her body. Declan becomes a suspect and he hides at Lassiter's Hotel. He is kidnapped by Nick Thompson (Marty Grimwood) and Laura Davidson (Jodi Flockhart), who want money from Paul. Laura {{eventually}} frees Declan and he is found by Rebecca, Paul and Oliver. Bridget believes Declan cannot handle her disability and she starts dating Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). At an illegal dance party, Bridget, Josh and Declan become trapped when the roof falls in. Declan manages to carry Josh out before coming back for Bridget. He tells her that he does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> her disability and they start a relationship. Bridget discovers that she is pregnant and when she tells Declan, he runs away. He is arrested and kisses a football groupie, but he later returns and commits to Bridget and the baby. When Declan tries to rescue Elle Robinson's (Pippa Black) cat, he receives an electric shock. This makes him think about his life and he proposes to Bridget, who accepts. A few months later, Declan and Bridget marry in front of their friends.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} to Ramsay Street, Bridget makes friends with Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) {{and she joins}} his {{football}} team, despite opposition from bully Justin Hunter (Chris Toohey). Bridget joins Declan Napier when he begins joyriding. During a race with Justin, they are pursued by the police. They return home thinking they escaped, {{only to find the}} police waiting for them. Bridget is banned from seeing Declan, but she sneaks out to meet him at the park, where they argue. On her way home, Bridget trips and falls into the road in front of a car being driven by Susan Kennedy. Susan blacks out, a result of suffering from multiple sclerosis, and hits Bridget. She drives off, unaware of what she has done. Bridget is found and rushed to the hospital, where she undergoes emergency surgery for a bleed on her brain. She remains unconscious, until Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) visits and pleads with her to wake up. Bridget's hand moves and she awakes the next day. However, she cannot feel anything down the left side of her body and she is told that she could be permanently disabled. Susan realises that she caused the accident and comes forward. She is arrested and put on trial. Bridget remembers that she fell into the road and that the accident was not Susan's fault, and she tells the court. During a rehabilitation class at the swimming pool, Bridget meets Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). Following a disastrous date with Declan, where Bridget is given the impression that Declan cannot handle her disability, Bridget begins dating Josh. Following a roof collapse at an illegal dance party, Bridget and Josh are both trapped in rubble. Declan carries Josh out before coming back for Bridget. Another collapse traps Declan and Bridget together and Declan tells her that he does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> her disability. Shortly after, Bridget begins to walk without her walking aid and her mobility returns.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{responses}} to these views {{have been made by}} Reform and Conservative Jews; they hold that these criticisms are against teachings that do not exist within liberal forms of Judaism, and which are rare in Orthodox Judaism (outside certain Haredi communities, such as Chabad).

25|$|Because wax moths cannot {{survive a}} cold winter, {{they are usually}} {{not a problem for}} beekeepers in the {{northern}} U.S. or Canada, unless they survive winter in heated storage, or are brought from the south by purchase or migration of beekeepers. They thrive and spread most rapidly with temperatures above 30°C (90°F), so some areas with only occasional days that are hot rarely <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> wax moths, unless the colony is already weak due to stress from other factors.|$|E
25|$|Many {{homosexual}} and bisexual individuals <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> {{the use of}} the pink triangle symbol, as it was the symbol that Hitler's regime use to tag and persecute homosexuals (similar to the yellow Star of David constituted of two opposed, overlapping triangles). Therefore, a double moon symbol was devised specifically to avoid the use of triangles. The double moon symbol is common in Germany and surrounding countries. Another symbol used for bisexuality is a purple diamond, conceptually derived from the intersection of two triangles, pink and blue (respectively), placed overlapping.|$|E

25|$|Anorexia nervosa, often {{referred}} to simply as anorexia, is an eating disorder characterized by low weight, fear of gaining weight, and {{a strong desire to}} be thin, resulting in food restriction. Many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are in fact underweight. If asked they usually deny they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> low weight. Often they weigh themselves frequently, eat only small amounts, and only eat certain foods. Some will exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to produce weight loss. Complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. Women will often stop having menstrual periods.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} the {{creation}} of the residential school's, the Sons of Freedom had become a concern for the province of British Columbia as a whole; they seemed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> any sort of government, in addition to the laws and policies that were being enforced. Public and Authorities were unhappy because the Sons Of Freedom did not register their births, deaths or marriages that occurred within their communities; in addition to the fact that they weren't sending their children to public schools. Public alarm was increasing, based on the fears that the unruly incidents of nude protests, burning of homes and buildings and bombings of bridges and railways, were not being attended to by the RCMP.|$|E

25|$|About 219,000 {{water rights}} claims in 85 sub-basins were filed before {{the close of}} the filing period in 1982. Every year from 1979 to 1997, the Chief Water Judge's office handled between 2,000 and 3,000 water claims. Water masters handled the {{remainder}} of the claims. Although verification of water claims can be swift, resolution of objections to the preliminary decree can last a decade or more. Roughly 40 to 50 percent of water rights claims <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> verification, priority, or an objection. For example, the Gallatin River basin preliminary decree was issued on September 18, 1985. There were 5,699 water rights claims in the basin, and 1,600 objections to the preliminary decree. Those objections were not resolved until 1997.|$|E
25|$|The orange litter-mates {{of white}} tigers are not prone to strabismus. Siamese cats and albinos of every species {{which have been}} studied all exhibit the same visual pathway {{abnormality}} found in white tigers. Siamese cats are also sometimes cross-eyed, as are some albino ferrets. The visual pathway abnormality was first documented in white tigers in the brain of a white tiger called Moni after he died, although his eyes were of normal alignment. The abnormality {{is that there is}} a disruption in the optic chiasm. The examination of Moni's brain suggested the disruption is less severe in white tigers than it is in Siamese cats. Because of the visual pathway abnormality, by which some optic nerves are routed to the wrong side of the brain, white tigers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> spatial orientation, and bump into things until they learn to compensate. Some tigers compensate by crossing their eyes. When the neurons pass from the retina to the brain and reach the optic chiasma, some cross and some do not, so that visual images are projected to the wrong hemisphere of the brain. White tigers cannot see as well as normal tigers and suffer from photophobia, like albinos.|$|E
25|$|However, Krause {{also made}} many picks {{that did not}} help the team. In 1986, Krause planned on {{selecting}} a tall forward named Brad Sellers in the NBA Draft. Sellers, Krause reasoned, was too good a pick to pass up, as he handled the ball very well for a big man, and also had a solid outside jumper. Jordan, on the other hand, pushed management to take a two-way guard from Duke named Johnny Dawkins. It looked as though Krause would take Dawkins even {{as late as the}} morning of the draft; the coaches and players had {{made it clear that they}} wanted him and not Sellers, and Krause did not particularly <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Dawkins' game. The Bulls' head coach at the time, Doug Collins, even told Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski the night before the draft that the team would pick Dawkins. However, Krause ignored everyone and picked Sellers anyway, and spent the summer trying to sell him to Jordan. Jordan went after Sellers mercilessly in practice, and Sellers was traded after three seasons. He played six total seasons in the NBA, averaging 6.3 points per game. Dawkins played for nine seasons in the NBA and averaged 11.1 points per game, though he did suffer from various injuries throughout his career.|$|E
