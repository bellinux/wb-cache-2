5|$|In an {{interview}} with US News, Riordan said that to write the book, he used his experience of having traveled to the Mediterranean with his family {{as part of a}} Disney-Hyperion promotion {{for the end of the}} Percy Jackson & the Olympians. Many of the tourist destinations he visited were included in the series, but because of the conflicting portrayals of Tartarus in literature, the author said that he appealed to <b>his</b> <b>imagination</b> to write the scenes of the underworld.|$|E
5|$|Verville {{was born}} in Atlantic Mine, {{a small town in}} Michigan's Upper Peninsula, on November 16, 1890, as the son of Victor Verville and Fabianna Miron. As a child, his mother bought him a Conyne-style box kite from Sears Roebuck, which {{captured}} <b>his</b> <b>imagination</b> and started his interest in flight and aviation. Verville also began reading stories about the Wright Brothers in newspapers and magazines with great interest. Later he even wrote to the Wrights and Glenn Curtiss and received responses.|$|E
5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express <b>his</b> <b>imagination</b> to the greatest effect.|$|E

Pym decides to follow Augustus as a stowaway aboard the Grampus, a whaling vessel commanded by Augustus's father that is bound for the southern seas. Augustus helps Pym by preparing a hideout in the hold for him and smuggling Tiger, Pym's faithful dog, on board. Augustus promises to provide Pym with water and food until the ship is too far from shore to return, at which time Pym wants to reveal himself.|$|E
5|$|Alan {{receives}} {{a call from}} a man purporting to be Alice's kidnapper, demanding the pages of Departure in exchange for her. Meeting at a state park, Alan is about to turn over the pages when the man is consumed by a dark tornado and Alan is knocked out. He awakes in Barry and Dr. Hartman's care in the lodge overlooking Cauldron Lake. Dr. Hartman listens to Alan's story, and believes he is suffering a psychotic break; everything that he's witnessed being part of <b>his</b> <b>imagination.</b> Alan attempts to escape the lodge as the shadowy force starts to attack it; while running, Alan finds evidence that Dr. Hartman is aware of the supernatural events surrounding the lake. Barry helps Alan to escape the lodge before the shadow subsumes it and all those inside. Returning to town, they find the FBI have arrived, and attempt to arrest him, before the shadowy forces intervene, allowing Alan and Barry to escape.|$|E
5|$|George R. R. Martin {{was already}} a {{successful}} fantasy and sci-fi author and TV writer before writing his A Song of Ice and Fire book series. Martin had published his first short story in 1971 and his first novel in 1977. By the mid-1990s, he had won three Hugo Awards, two Nebula Awards, and other awards for his short fiction. Although his early books were well received within the fantasy fiction community, his readership remained relatively small and Martin took on jobs as a writer in Hollywood in the mid-1980s. He worked principally on the revival of The Twilight Zone throughout 1986 and on Beauty and the Beast until 1990, but he also developed his own TV pilots and wrote feature film scripts. He grew frustrated that his pilots and screenplays were not getting made and that TV-related production limitations like budgets and episode lengths were forcing him to cut characters and trim battle scenes. This pushed Martin back towards writing books, where {{he did not have}} to worry about compromising the size of <b>his</b> <b>imagination.</b> Admiring the works of J. R. R. Tolkien in his childhood, he wanted to write an epic fantasy, though he did not have any specific ideas.|$|E

5|$|If, in {{the famous}} garden and {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician {{that he had to}} give <b>his</b> <b>imagination</b> a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E
5|$|Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Serbian realist painters of the late 19th century. During his early career, he came to be identified with Orientalist painting, depicting scenes from the Balkans, which were then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Between 1877 and 1882, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he came under the mentorship of painting instructors Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller. Griepenkerl taught the young Jovanović the underlying structural principles of Renaissance and Baroque art, thus helping him better understand spatial problems and the arrangement of large numbers of figures, both moving and static. Müller encouraged Jovanović to take a naturalist approach to painting, recording only what he could see and relying as little as possible on <b>his</b> <b>imagination.</b> It was in this context that Müller instructed Jovanović to make direct studies of Balkan life during his visits home, purposely steering him towards Orientalist painting.|$|E
5|$|Quinton, {{a student}} at the school {{mentioned}} before, calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night. His father tells him that it was <b>his</b> <b>imagination,</b> goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes {{to the conclusion that the}} man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of the trail, and finds no one there. Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E

5|$|In 1790 he {{published}} his Account of London, which {{went through a}} large number of editions. It was written in the style of his previous works and contained information on things of historical interest in the parts of the capital to which his wanderings led him. By this stage of his life he preferred to make tours in <b>his</b> <b>imagination</b> rather than in reality and {{he published}} a second edition of his Indian Zoology. He also conceived the idea of publishing a work on a global scale and set to work on the first two volumes of what was planned to be a fourteen volume series. Each country was to have maps and sketches, colour plates and an account of the country's production with notes on its natural history. All this was to be gleaned from the writing of others who had seen these places themselves. The first two volumes appeared early in 1798 and covered most of India and Ceylon. Volumes three and four included the parts of India east of the Ganges, Malaysia, Japan and China but before these were published he suffered a gradual decline in health and vigour and died at Downing, in December 1798. These two volumes were edited and published posthumously by his son, David, as were also several other short papers and an autobiographical work, The literary life of the late Thomas Pennant, Esq. By himself..|$|E

50|$|Although Klácel industriously translated, {{published}} {{and wrote a}} number of popular scientific handbooks, American reality did not meet with <b>his</b> <b>imaginations</b> and he fell into serious financial difficulties.

Before his death Klácel wrote a testament which summed up his teachings. He was buried in Belle Plaine, and at the Czech cemetery a monument was unveiled in his honour by his countrymen.|$|R

25|$|While at Cambridge, Thomson {{was active}} in sports, {{athletics}} and sculling, winning the Colquhoun Sculls in 1843.
