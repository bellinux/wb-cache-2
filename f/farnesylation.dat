50|$|Farnesyltransferase posttranslationally-modifies {{proteins}} {{by adding}} an isoprenoid lipid called a farnesyl {{group to the}} -SH of the cysteine {{near the end of}} target proteins to form a thioether linkage. This process, called <b>farnesylation</b> (which is a type of prenylation), causes farnesylated proteins to become membrane-associated due to the hydrophobic nature of the farnesyl group. Most farnesylated proteins are involved in cellular signaling wherein membrane association is critical for function.|$|E
50|$|Farnesyl and geranyl {{pyrophosphate}} {{also serve}} as precursors for prenylated proteins. Prenylation is a common type of covalent post-translational modification at C-terminal CaaX motifs that allows proteins to localize to membranes or bind to one another. A notable example of the former is the <b>farnesylation</b> of small G-proteins including Ras, CDC42, Rho, and Rac. The attachment of a hydrophobic aliphatic chain as those present in farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups allows small G-proteins to tether from membranes and carry out effector functions.|$|E
50|$|Ras2 becomes post-translationally {{modified}} in two ways, both being {{necessary for}} its activity: Upon activation, palmitoylation at its C terminus takes place and causes attachment from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. <b>Farnesylation</b> allows for efficient {{interaction with the}} downstream adenylate cyclase Cyr1p. In wild-type yeast deactivated Ras2 is transported to and degraded in the vacuole, a process for which Whi2 is essential. Interestingly, disturbing this process leads to Ras2 accumulation at the mitochondrial membrane, a behavior that was not observed before.|$|E

Interestingly, these parasites seem to be more vulnerable to inhibition of Farnesyltransferase than humans, even though the drugs tested selectively target human FTase. In some cases the reason for this may be the parasites lack Geranylgeranyltransferase I. This vulnerability may pave the way for the development of selective, low toxicity, FTI based anti-parasitic drugs 'piggybacking' on the development of FTIs for cancer research.|$|E
50|$|A {{mouse model}} of {{progeria}} exists, {{though in the}} mouse, the LMNA prelamin A is not mutated. Instead, ZMPSTE24, the specific protease that is required to remove the C-terminus of prelamin A, is missing. Both cases result in the buildup of farnesylated prelamin A on the nuclear membrane and in the characteristic nuclear LMNA blebbing. Fong et al. use a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) in this mouse model to inhibit protein <b>farnesylation</b> of prelamin A. Treated mice had greater grip strength and lower likelihood of rib fracture and may live longer than untreated mice.|$|E

50|$|A-type lamins are {{characterized}} by a neutral isoelectric point, and they are typically displayed during later stages of embryonic development. Expressed in differentiated cells, A-type lamins originate from the LMNA gene. Two isoforms, lamins A and C, can be created from this gene via alternative splicing. This creates a high amount of homology between the isoforms. Unlike lamin C, Lamin A is generated in a precursor form called prelamin A. Prelamin A and lamin C differ in structure only at the carboxyl-terminus. Here, prelamin A contains two extra exons that lamin C lacks. Furthermore, lamin C contains six unique amino-acid residues while prelamin A contains ninety-eight residues {{not found in the}} other isoform. A CaaX motif is found within the unique residues in prelamin A. Due to the presence of the CaaX motif, prelamin A undergoes a series of posttranslational modifications to become mature lamin A. These steps include <b>farnesylation</b> of the carboxyl-terminal cysteine, endoproteolytic release of the terminal amino acids, carboxymethalation of the accessible farnesylcysteine, and removal of the final fifteen residues by a zinc metalloprotease. The very first modification involving <b>farnesylation</b> of prelamin A is crucial to the development of mature lamin A. Isoform lamin C does not undergo posttranslational modifications. Some studies have demonstrated that lamins A and C are not required for the formation of the nuclear lamina, yet disruptions in the LMNA gene can contribute to physical and mental limitations.|$|E

50|$|RHEB {{functions}} differently {{compared to}} other proteins in the Ras superfamily.

However, unlike those in the Ras superfamily, conformational change when shuttling between forms only affects switch I, while switch II remains relatively stable, due to difference in secondary structure. Ras switch II forms a long α-helical structure between shuttling, while RHEB switch II adopts a more atypical conformation allowing for novel functions. Such a conformation causes a decreased intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis as compared to RAS due to the catalytic Asp65 in the switch II region of RHEB being blocked from the active site.|$|E
50|$|While lamin {{mutations}} {{can produce}} a series of disorders ranging from muscular dystrophies to neuropathies, the most common disorder is Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). This genetic condition is characterized by rapid onset aging. Children appear normal at birth, but as they grow and develop they show signs of severe aging. Some of these signs include {{but are not limited}} to hair-loss, thinness, joint abnormalities, and retarded motor skills. Affected individuals also develop age-related health problems such as atherosclerosis and high blood pressure. People with this disorder typically die in their early teens, usually by heart attack or stroke. HGPS is caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene that codes for lamin A. The genetic alteration results in an alternative splice, creating a mutated form of prelamin A that is much shorter and lacks the cleavage site for a zinc metalloprotease. Because prelamin A cannot be properly processed during posttranslational modifications, it retains its lipid modification (<b>farnesylation)</b> and remains in the inner nuclear membrane. This disrupts the mechanical stability of the nucleus, resulting in a higher rate of cell death and therefore a higher rate of aging.|$|E

MSCs were plated and induced to differentiate into adipocytes for three weeks. Differentiating cells were treated with either an inhibitor of <b>farnesylation</b> (FTI- 277) or vehicle alone. The effect of inhibition of <b>farnesylation</b> in differentiating adipocytes was determined by oil red O staining. Cell survival was quantified using MTS Formazan. Additionally, nuclear extracts were obtained and prelamin A, chaperon protein HDJ- 2, PPARÃŽÂ³, and SREBP- 1 were determined by western blot. Finally, DNA binding PPARÃŽÂ³ activity was determined using an ELISA-based PPARÃŽÂ³ activation quantification method. Treatment with an inhibitor of <b>farnesylation</b> (FTI- 277) arrests adipogenesis without affecting cell survival. This effect was concomitant with lower levels of PPARÃŽÂ³ expression and activity. Finally, accumulation of prelamin A induced an increased proportion of mature SREBP- 1 which is known to affect PPARÃŽÂ³ activity. In summary, inhibition of protein <b>farnesylation</b> arrests the adipogenic differentiation of MSCs and affects PPARÃŽÂ³ expression and activity...|$|E

Aging adult Caenorhabditis elegans show changes in nuclear architecture resembling those seen in HGPS fibroblasts, {{as well as}} a decline in motility, phenotypes which are also inhibited by the FTI gliotoxin. However, it was not clear whether these effects were due to loss of <b>farnesylation</b> or to side effects of this drug. Here, we used a different FTI, manumycin or downregulated polyprenyl synthetase with RNAi to test the roles of <b>farnesylation</b> in C. elegans aging.

40|$|Recently, many inhibitors of farnesyl protein {{transferase}} (FPTase) {{have been}} identified. Some of them interrupt cell growth {{in addition to}} Ras and nuclear lamin processing of Ras-transformed cells. We have tested {{the effect of the}} FPTase inhibitors manumycin, an analogue of farnesyl diphosphate, and KT 7595, a gliotoxin derivative, on Ras <b>farnesylation,</b> DNA synthesis and the anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of human colon carcinoma (LoVo), hepatoma (Mahlavu and PLC/PRF/ 5) and gastric carcinoma (KATO III). Both drugs severely inhibited DNA synthesis, cellular proliferation and Ras <b>farnesylation</b> in LoVo and moderately reduced them in Mahlavu and PLC/PRF/ 5 but not in KATO III. Complete sequencing of ras genes, however, revealed that LoVo and KATO III have activated Ki-ras and activated N-ras, respectively, whereas Mahlavu and PLC/PRF/ 5 have no activated ras. We next checked whether the inhibition of the cellular proliferation is due to the blocking of nuclear lamin function. Neither drug disturbed lamin <b>farnesylation</b> and localization, as demonstrated using metabolic labelling, immunoblotting and indirect immunofluorescence.

40|$|SummaryG {{proteins}} are posttranslationally {{modified by}} isoprenylation: either <b>farnesylation</b> or geranylgeranylation. The γ subunit of retinal transducin (Tα/Tβγ) is selectively farnesylated, and the <b>farnesylation</b> {{is required for}} light signaling mediated by transducin in rod cells. However, whether and how this selective isoprenylation regulates cellular functions remain poorly understood. Here we report that knockin mice expressing geranylgeranylated Tγ showed normal rod responses to dim flashes under dark-adapted conditions but exhibited impaired properties in light adaptation. Of note, geranylgeranylation of Tγ suppressed light-induced transition of Tβγ from membrane to cytosol, and also attenuated its light-dependent translocation from the outer segment to the inner region, an event contributing to retinal light adaptation.

40|$|A {{recently}} developed proteomics strategy, designated tagging-via-substrate (TAS) approach, is described {{for the detection}} and proteomic analysis of farnesylated proteins. TAS technology involves metabolic incorporation of a synthetic azido-farnesyl analog and chemoselective derivatization of azido-farnesyl-modified proteins by an elegant version of Staudinger reaction, pioneered by the Bertozzi group, using a biotinylated phosphine capture reagent. The resulting protein conjugates can be specifically detected and/or affinity-purified by streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase or agarose beads, respectively. Thus, the technology enables global profiling of farnesylated proteins by enriching farnesylated proteins and reducing the complexity of <b>farnesylation</b> subproteome. Azido-farnesylated proteins maintain the properties of protein <b>farnesylation,</b> including promoting membrane association, Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase activation, and inhibition of lovastatin-induced apoptosis. A proteomic analysis of farnesylated proteins by TAS technology revealed 18 farnesylated proteins, including those with potentially novel <b>farnesylation</b> motifs, suggesting that future use of this method is likely to yield novel insight into protein <b>farnesylation.</b> TAS technology can be extended to other posttranslational modifications, such as geranylgeranylation and myristoylation, thus providing powerful tools for detection, quantification, and proteomic analysis of posttranslationally modified proteins...|$|E

Initial recognition results in activation of specific Resistance (R) proteins that trigger downstream immune responses, in which the signaling networks remain largely unknown. A point mutation in SUPPRESSOR OF NPR 1 CONSTITUTIVE 1 (SNC 1), a RESISTANCE TO PERONOSPORA PARASITICA 4 R gene homolog, renders plants constitutively resistant to virulent pathogens. Genetic suppressors of snc 1 may carry mutations in genes encoding novel signaling components downstream of activated R proteins. One such suppressor {{was identified as a}} novel loss-of-function allele of ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABSCISIC ACID 1 (ERA 1), which encodes the β-subunit of protein farnesyltransferase. Protein <b>farnesylation</b> involves attachment of C 15 -prenyl residues to the carboxyl termini of specific target proteins. Mutant era 1 plants display enhanced susceptibility to virulent bacterial and oomycete pathogens, implying a role for <b>farnesylation</b> in basal defense.

ERA 1 acts partly independent of abscisic acid and additively with the resistance regulator NON-EXPRESSOR OF PR GENES 1 in the signaling network. Defects in geranylgeranyl transferase I, a protein modification similar to <b>farnesylation,</b> do not affect resistance responses, indicating that <b>farnesylation</b> is most likely specifically required in plant defense signaling.

40|$|The large {{hepatitis}} {{delta antigen}} (HDAg-L) mediates {{hepatitis delta virus}} (HDV) assembly and inhibits HDV RNA replication. <b>Farnesylation</b> of the cysteine residue within the HDAg-L carboxyl terminus is required for both functions.

Observed differences in efficiency of VLP incorporation could be attributed to genotype-specific differences within the HDAg-L carboxyl terminus. Using a novel assay to quantify the extent of HDAg-L <b>farnesylation,</b> we found that genotype 3 HDAg-L was inefficiently farnesylated when expressed {{in the absence of the}} small hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg-S). However, as the intracellular ratio of HDAg-S to HDAg-L was increased, so too was the extent of HDAg-L <b>farnesylation</b> for all three genotypes. Single point mutations within the carboxyl terminus of HDAg-L were screened, and three mutants that severely inhibited assembly without affecting <b>farnesylation</b> were identified. The observed assembly defects persisted under conditions where the mutants were known to have access to the site of VLP assembly. Therefore, the corresponding residues within the wild-type protein are likely required for direct interaction with viral envelope proteins. Finally, it was observed that when HDAg-S was artificially myristoylated, it could efficiently inhibit HDV RNA replication. Hence, a general association with membranes enables HDAg to inhibit replication. In contrast, although myristoylated HDAg-S was incorporated into VLPs far more efficiently than HDAg-S or nonfarnesylated HDAg-L, it was incorporated far less efficiently than wild-type HDAg-L; thus, <b>farnesylation</b> was required for efficient assembly...|$|E

The Dot/Icm type IV secretion system of Legionella pneumophila injects into host cells the F-box effector Ankyrin B (AnkB), which functions as platforms for the docking of polyubiquitinated proteins to the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) to enable intravacuolar proliferation in macrophages and amoeba. We show that <b>farnesylation</b> of AnkB is indispensable for its anchoring to the cytosolic face of the LCV membrane, for its biological function within macrophages and Dictyostelium discoideum, and for intrapulmonary proliferation in mice. Remarkably, the protein farnesyltransferase, RCE- 1 (Ras-converting enzyme- 1), and isoprenyl cysteine carboxyl methyltransferase host <b>farnesylation</b> enzymes are recruited to the LCV in a Dot/Icm-dependent manner and are essential for the biological function of AnkB.
