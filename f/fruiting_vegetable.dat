40|$|In-field {{management}} of Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) and Zeugodacus cucumis (French) (Diptera: Tephritidae) in <b>fruiting</b> <b>vegetable</b> crops has relied {{almost exclusively on}} organophosphate cover sprays. Laboratory and semifield trials were performed to compare a number of alternative insecticides for efficacy against these species. A novel semifield method was used whereby the insecticides were applied to crops as cover sprays under field conditions, and treated plants bearing fruit were transferred to large cages and exposed to fruit flies. Efficacy was assessed in terms of numbers of pupae developing from treated fruit. A laboratory cage method was also used to assess effects on adult mortality and comparative effects of 1 - and 3 -d-aged residues. The neonicotinoids clothianidin and thiacloprid were very effective against B. tryoni and Z. cucumis. Clothianidin was the only insecticide other than dimethoate to affect adult mortality. The synthetic pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin was also very effective, particularly in semifield trials, although higher incidence of aphid and whitefly infestation was observed in this treatment compared to others. Cyantraniliprole was effective against B. tryoni, but less effective against Z. cucumis. Imidacloprid, bifenthrin, spinetoram, and abamectin were all relatively less effective, although all demonstrated a suppressive effect...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyGanga M. HettiarachchiUrban soils {{may contain}} harmful levels of {{potentially}} toxic contaminants. These contaminants transfer to humans via two exposure pathways: direct transfer (soil-humans by soil ingestion, dermal exposure and inhalation) and food chain transfer (soil-plant-humans). Soil amendments alter the speciation of the contaminants in soils and thereby modify their bioavailability. The objectives {{of this research}} were to access the plant availability of lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); bioaccessibility and speciation of soil Pb, and As; and dermal absorption of soil PAHs in contaminated urban soils; and effectiveness of soil organic amendments on reducing contaminant bioavailability. Two field experiments were conducted in Kansas City, MO and Indianapolis, IN. Both sites had elevated concentrations of Pb in soils (Kansas City site: 30 - 380 mg kg⁻¹ and Indianapolis site: 200 - 700 mg kg⁻¹). Indianapolis site’s soils also had elevated concentrations of As (40 - 100 mg kg⁻¹) and PAHs (benzo[a]pyrene: 1 - 10 mg kg⁻¹). A control treatment (no-compost) and compost-types (leaf compost and/or composted biosolids, non-composted biosolids, mushroom compost) were used as treatments. A leafy vegetable, a <b>fruiting</b> <b>vegetable</b> and a root crop were grown for two growing seasons. The treatments were arranged in split-plot design (main plot factor: compost; sub-plot factor plant-type). An in vitro steady fluid experiment was conducted using human skins to examine the dermal transfer of soil PAHs. The concentrations of Pb, As, and PAHs in the vegetables were low, except Pb in root crops. Compost reduced the bioaccessibility of Pb, but did not change the bioaccessibility of As. Selected soil samples were analyzed for speciation of Pb using extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy. The predominant Pb species were Pb sorbed to Fe oxy(hydr) oxide and to organic C. Stable Pb phosphates (pyromorphite) was formed during the in vitro extraction. Dermal transfer experiments showed PAHs in the contaminated soils did not transfer through the skin. Stratum conium of the skin acted as a barrier for dermal transfer of soil PAHs. In general, the risk of food chain transfer of soil Pb, As, and PAHs were low in the studied sites and can be further reduced by compost addition. Bioaccessibility of Pb and As in urban soils were low. Dermal absorption of soil PAHs was insignificant...|$|E
40|$|Although {{reviews of}} the {{association}} between polyphenol intake and cognition exist, research examining the cognitive effects of <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetable,</b> and juice consumption across epidemiological and intervention studies has not been previously examined. Critical inclusion criteria were human participants, a measure of <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetable,</b> or 100 % juice consumption, an objective measure of cognitive function, and a clinical diagnosis of neuropsychological disease. Studies were excluded if consumption of <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> or juice was not assessed in isolation from other foods groups, or {{if there was no}} statistical control for education or IQ. Seventeen of 19 epidemiological studies and 3 of 6 intervention studies reported significant benefits of <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetable,</b> or juice consumption for cognitive performance. The data suggest that chronic consumption of <b>fruits,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> and juices is beneficial for cognition in healthy older adults. The limited data from acute interventions indicate that consumption of fruit juices can have immediate benefits for memory function in adults with mild cognitive impairment; however, as of yet, acute benefits have not been observed in healthy adults. Conclusions regarding an optimum dietary intake for <b>fruits,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> and juices are difficult to quantify because of substantial heterogeneity in the categorization of consumption of these foods...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionInsufficient {{intake of}} fresh <b>fruits,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> and dairy {{products}} among children is a serious nutrition-related concern. The aim of our {{study was to determine}} behavioral and environmental factors that influence <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetable,</b> and dairy consumption among Serbian schoolchildren. MethodsWe used 24 -hour recall to measure <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetable,</b> and dairy intake of schoolchildren (N = 212) aged 8 to 11 years from 2 elementary schools in a local community in Serbia. We evaluated potential determinants of intake by using a 48 -item questionnaire that asked about children 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s behaviors, perceptions of others 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 expectations and behaviors, reinforcement of children 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s behaviors, and availability of <b>fruits,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> and dairy at home and school. Children completed written questionnaires during 1 school class under teacher supervision. Binary logistic regression was used to analyze determinants of <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetable,</b> and dairy intake. ResultsNegative predictors of fruit intake were expectations from teacher and parents (P <. 001) to eat fruit and availability of <b>fruit</b> in school. <b>Vegetable</b> intake was positively related to paternal modeling behavior (P <. 001) and availability of vegetables at home (P =. 04). Dairy intake was positively influenced by parental reinforcement (P =. 03). ConclusionVarious personal and environmental factors are associated with children 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s intake of <b>fruits,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> and dairy. Interventions to promote <b>fruit,</b> <b>vegetable,</b> and dairy consumption in Serbian schoolchildren should focus on modeling and reinforcement by parents and teachers and increasing availability at school and at home...|$|R

40|$|Determinants of <b>fruit</b> and <b>vegetable</b> consumption, {{including}} affordability and attitudes, {{have been}} poorly investigated, especially in European deprived populations. Our {{objective was to}} analyze various determinants of low consumption of <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b> in disadvantaged participants. Our participants were randomized into 2 groups, 1 which received nutritional advice alone and 1 that also received vouchers that were exchangeable for <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b> during a 12 -mo period. Socioeconomic characteristics, food insufficiency, affordability, and motivation for eating <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b> were assessed. A short FFQ was administered. Determinants of consumption of < 1 fruit or vegetable/d were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. A total of 295 participants were included (mean age 44. 8 y; 133 men, 162 women). At baseline, mean daily consumption of <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b> was 2. 13 +/- 1. 57 times/d. Nearly 30 % of the sample did not eat <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b> every day. Determinants of low <b>fruit</b> and <b>vegetable</b> consumption were: age younger than 55 y, education level lower than tertiary, and absence of financial means for buying <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b> daily. Other determinants were affordability (whether <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b> are affordable, lack of money in preventing healthy diet) and attitudes (whether one's own diet is healthy, whether or not <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b> improve health, whether eating <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b> is a pleasure). Thus, determinants of inadequate consumption of <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables</b> in this deprived French population are numerous. The impact of financial difficulties is crucial, as is the perception of affordability of <b>fruits</b> and <b>vegetables.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
