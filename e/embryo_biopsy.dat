DesignRetrospective cohort analysis. SettingGenetic testing reference laboratory. Patient(s) Seventy-four couples who underwent IVF-PGD due to a parental translocation. Intervention(s) IVF cycles and <b>embryo</b> <b>biopsies</b> were performed by referring clinics. Biopsy samples were sent to a single reference lab for PGD for the translocation plus 24 -chromosome aneuploidy screening {{with the use of a}} single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray. Main Outcome Measure(s) LBR per biopsy cycle, aneuploidy rate, embryo transfer (ET) rate, miscarriage rate. Result(s) The LBR per IVF biopsy cycle was 38 %. LBR for patients reaching ET was 52 %. Clinical miscarriage rate was 10 %. Despite a mean age of 33. 8  years and mean of 7 <b>embryos</b> <b>biopsied,</b> there was a 30 % chance for no chromosomally normal embryos. Maternal age > 35  years, day 3 biopsy, and having fewer than five <b>embryos</b> available for <b>biopsy</b> increased the risk of no ET.

Thirty-nine patients were recruited for the study from an assisted reproductive programme. Semen samples were prepared by using gradient centrifugation techniques.

Sperm selection {{was based on the}} concept of 'best-looking' spermatozoa i. e. spermatozoa lacking gross and obvious malformations such as broken necks, cytoplasmic droplets, amorphous or elongated heads. Photomicrographs of each sperm cell were produced from video footage. The photographical material was used to determine the basic shape and the actual length-to-width ratio of the injected sperm heads. <b>Embryo</b> <b>biopsies</b> and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed on 12 randomly selected couples from a set of 39.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Embryo</b> <b>biopsy</b> is an {{essential}} but invasive procedure to perform preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). The major objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether <b>embryo</b> <b>biopsy</b> might cause post-natal growth restriction. METHODS: We compared growth data and physical findings at birth and 2 years for singletons born either after PGD/PGS (n = 70), ICSI (n = 70) or natural conception (NC) (n = 70). Children were matched for gender, maternal educational level, mother tongue and birth order. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between the three groups regarding weight, height and head circumference standard deviation scores (SDS) at birth and at age 2 years, although the PGD/PGS children tended to have a lower birthweight compared with the NC children. At 2 years, the mean BMI SDS in PGD/PGS children was significantly lower compared with NC children (P = 0. 005). PGD/PGS children were more frequently born after Caesarian section than ICSI children, but had no more congenital malformations, hospital admissions and surgical interventions compared with ICSI and NC children. CONCLUSIONS: Singleton children at age 2 years born after <b>embryo</b> <b>biopsy</b> applied in PGD/PGS present a similar post-natal linear growth compared with ICSI and NC children. PGD/PGS singletons appear not to be at higher risk for congenital malformations and surgical interventions during the first 2 years of life. To date, there have been no observable detrimental effects of the PGD/PGS procedure on children. © The Author 2008.

All these techniques require several laboratory manipulation procedures before embryo transfer: oocyte zona pellucida laser drilling, <b>embryo</b> <b>biopsy,</b> cryopreservation and thawing, {{that might affect}} embryo survival and its implantation potential (Scott et al. 2013 a; Zhang et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The major {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether the <b>embryo</b> <b>biopsy</b> procedure might cause growth restriction or affect health outcome of children. STUDY DESIGN: Auxological data and physical findings were compared at birth and age 2 for 102 children (70 singletons and 32 twins) born after PGD/PGS and 102 matched children born after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in a prospective study. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences regarding weight, height and head circumference standard deviation scores (SDS) at birth and at age two years were observed. At two years of age the mean BMI SDS tended to be lower in PGD/PGS children (p= 0. 058). PGD/PGS babies had been more often breastfed (p= 0. 013), but mostly during a shorter time. The prevalence of major as well as minor congenital anomalies, hospital admissions and surgical interventions was similar. CONCLUSION: Children born after <b>embryo</b> <b>biopsy</b> applied in PGD/PGS present similar prenatal and postnatal growth and health outcome in the first two years of life compared to ICSI children.

The development of the biopsied embryos was studied during in vitro culture and in utero following embryo transfer. There was no significant difference between the treated and the control groups in the ratio of embryos that developed to the blastocyst stage, although the biopsied embryos were delayed in their development because they contained significantly fewer cells compared to the control ones at the same stage. Although there was no difference in the ratio of implantation, the development of the biopsied embryos in utero was also delayed 12 - 24 hours on the 9 th day of pregnancy. No difference in development was visible from the 13 th day of pregnancy. Statistically, no differences were found in the developmental ratio (number of developed fetuses/transferred embryos) of the control and treated embryos during gastrulation (9 th day of pregnancy), at the beginning of organogenesis (13 th day of pregnancy) and before birth (19 th day of pregnancy).

Although this approach yields good results, variable embryo quality and rates of development remain a challenge. Here, a case is reported in which a blastocyst was biopsied for PGS by array comparative genomic hybridization on day 6 after insemination, having hatched completely. In addition to a small trophectoderm sample, excluded cell fragments from the subzonal space from this embryo were also sampled. Unexpectedly, the array comparative genomic hybridization results from the fragments and trophectoderm sample were non-concordant: 47,XX,+ 19 and 46,XY, respectively. DNA fingerprinting by short tandem repeat and amelogenin analysis confirmed the sex chromosome difference but seemed {{to show that the}} two samples were related but non-identical. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping and karyomapping identified that the origin of the DNA amplified from the fragments was that of the second polar body corresponding to the oocyte from which the <b>biopsied</b> <b>embryo</b> developed.

This study aimed to develop a biopsy method at the blastocyst stage that provides viable genotyped cryopreserved Welsh pony embryos. Embryos were collected at d 6. 75 to 7 after ovulation. Biopsies were performed with either a microblade or a micropipette. After <b>biopsy,</b> <b>embryos</b> were cryopreserved. The survival rate of <b>biopsied</b> <b>embryos</b> was evaluated on fresh and cryopreserved embryos either 24 h after in vitro culture or after transfer to recipients. Fresh and nonbiopsied embryos were used as controls. Sex, coat color genes, myotony (neuromuscular disorder) diagnosis, and markers of parentage were investigated using PCR on biopsied cells after whole-genome amplification and on remaining embryos. The embryo survival rate after transfer was not affected by the micropipette biopsy (50 %, n = 8; 43 %, n = 7; and 50 %, n = 12, at d 30 for fresh <b>biopsied</b> <b>embryos,</b> vitrified <b>biopsied</b> <b>embryos,</b> and control embryos, respectively) but was significantly reduced {{by the use of}} microblade biopsy: 9 (n = 11) vs. 67 % (n = 12) for control embryos. Successful sex determination was achieved for 82 % (n = 28) of the micropipette biopsies and 100 % (n = 50) of the microblade biopsies. Sex determined on biopsied cells was found to correspond completely (100 %) with that determined on the remaining embryo (n = 37). More than 90 % of the parentage checking markers, coat color, and myotony diagnosis were successfully determined on biopsies obtained with either a micropipette or a microblade. Mendelian incompatibility (7. 5 and 5. 5 %) and embryo genotyping errors (6. 6 and 8. 6 %) were low and not significantly different between the 2 methods.

The in vitro produced bovine embryos were subjected to biopsy at days 2, 3, and 4 post-insemination with different cell numbers (4 to 16 -cells). Embryo cell biopsy was carried out in a 100 μl drop of H-SOF following pronase drilling by aspiration of one blastomere. The biopsied embryos were then cultured in SOFaaBSA co-cultured with oviduct cells-monolayer until blastocyst formation. The blastocysts were cryopreserved at room tempera-ture after exposure of equilibration (glycerol 1. 4 M for 5 min and then glycerol 1. 4 M and ethylene glycol 3. 6 M for 5 min) and vitrification solutions (3. 4 M glycerol and 4. 6 M ethylene glycol). The blastocysts were loaded into the center of 0. 25 ml straws separated by air bubbles from 2 columns of sucrose 0. 5 M and plunged immediately into liquid nitrogen. There was no significant difference in cryosurvivability of vitrified-warmed blastocysts derived form biopsied embryos at different pre-compacted morula stages. The quality of biopsy derived blastocysts was identical to that of non-biopsy derived ones in terms of post vitrifcation survival and hatching rates.

Day 3 <b>embryo</b> <b>biopsies</b> were carried out, and the biopsied cell was checked by fluorescent in situ hybridization using relevant informative probes. Embryos with a normal or balanced translocation karyotype were transferred on Day 4. Results: Thirty-eight preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycles involving 17 couples were completed. A total of 450 (82. 6 %) of the total oocytes were MII oocytes, and 158 (60. 0 %) of the two-pronuclei <b>embryos</b> were <b>biopsied.</b> In 41. 4 % of the fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses, the results were either normal or balanced. Embryos were transferred back after 21 cycles. Three babies were born from Robertsonian translocation carriers and another two from reciprocal translocation carriers. The miscarriage rate was 0 %. Among the reciprocal translocation group, the live delivery rate was 8. 3 % per ovum pick-up cycle and 18. 2 % per embryo transfer cycle. Among the Robertsonian translocation group, the live delivery rate was 14. 3 % per ovum pick-up cycle and 20. 0 % per embryo transfer cycle. Conclusion: There is a trend whereby the outcome for Robertsonian translocation group carriers is better than that for reciprocal translocation group carriers. Aneuploidy screening may possibly be added in order to improve the outcome, especially for individuals with an advanced maternal age.

Thus, the detection of Y- and X-chromosome specific sequences is advantageous. Results A novel method for sex identification in mammals (sheep, Ovis aries and European red deer, Cervus elaphus) is described, using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of a part of the amelogenin gene. A partial sequence of the amelogenin gene of sheep and red deer was obtained, which exists on both X and Y chromosomes with a deletion region on the Y chromosome. With a specific pair of primers a DNA fragment of different length between the male and female mammal was amplified. Conclusion PCR amplification using the amelogenin gene primers is useful in sex identification of samples from sheep and red deer and can be applied to DNA analysis of micro samples with small amounts of DNA such as hair roots as well as bones or <b>embryo</b> <b>biopsies.</b> </p...|$|R
2500|$|PGD/PGS is an {{invasive}} procedure {{that requires a}} serious consideration, according to Michael Tucker, Ph.D., Scientific Director and Chief Embryologist at Georgia Reproductive Specialists in Atlanta. [...] One of the risks of PGD includes damage to the <b>embryo</b> during the <b>biopsy</b> procedure (which in turn destroys the embryo as a whole), according to Serena H. Chen, M.D., a New Jersey reproductive endocrinologist with IRMS Reproductive Medicine at Saint Barnabas. [...] Another risk is cryopreservation where the embryo is stored in a frozen state and thawed later for the procedure. About 20% of the thawed embryos do not survive. [...] There has been a study indicating a <b>biopsied</b> <b>embryo</b> has a less rate of surviving cryopreservation. [...] Another study suggests that PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy results in a significantly lower live birth rate for women of advanced maternal age. [...] Also, another study recommends the caution and a long term follow-up as PGD/PGS increases the perinatal death rate in multiple pregnancies.|$|R
40|$|<b>Biopsy</b> of <b>embryo</b> is a {{prerequisite}} technique employed in Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD). Removal {{of one or two}} intact blastomeres can be carried out without detriment to embryonic development. However, the effect of piezo-assisted biopsy on gene expression of embryos remains to be elucidated. This study was conducted to elucidate the effect of piezo-assisted biopsy on the 8 -cell, morula and blastocyst stages on embryonic development, global gene expression and their functional pathways. Following zona breaching by piezo-drilling, single blastomeres were removed from in vz'vo-derived 8 -cell ICR mouse <b>embryos.</b> <b>Biopsied</b> <b>embryos</b> were allowed to develop further in Ml 6 medium, and collected for RNA extraction after 1 h (8 -cell), 16 h (morula) and 42 h (blastocyst). cDNA were converted, amplified, labelled and hybridized on the GeneChip®. Microarray data were analysed using GeneSpring GX 12. Gene expression of non-biopsied and post-biopsied embryos at the 8 -cell, morula and blastocyst stages were compared using the t-test with p 1. 5 for each gene. Results showed a significant difference in blastocyst development after piezo-assisted biopsy. A total of 82 genes, 75 genes and 66 genes were significantly different at the 8 -cell, morula and blastocyst stages respectively. The differentially expressed genes were annotated using DAVID software for Gene Ontology and GO Metacore for pathways analyses. Several enriched genes at each stage were validated using RT-qPCR. The enriched pathways involved were energy metabolism, cell cycle, immune response and fatty acid metabolism. Elucidation of these changes provides a greater understanding of molecular alterations after piezo-assisted biopsy...|$|R
