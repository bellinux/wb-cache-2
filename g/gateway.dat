40|$|Abstract—In a {{wireless}} mesh network (WMN), the traffic is aggregated and forwarded towards the <b>gateways.</b> Strategically placing and connecting the <b>gateways</b> to the wired backbone {{is critical to}} the management and efficient operation of a WMN. In this paper, we address the problem of <b>gateways</b> placement, consisting in placing a minimum number of <b>gateways</b> such that quality-of-service (QoS) requirements are satisfied. We propose a polynomial time near-optimal algorithm which recursively com-putes minimum weighted Dominating Sets (DS), while consistently preserving QoS requirements across iterations. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm using both analysis and simulation, and show that it outperforms other alternative schemes by com-paring the number of <b>gateways</b> placed in different scenarios.

The {{aggregate}} throughput of the WMN {{versus the}} number of <b>gateways</b> is shown in Figure 9, where <b>gateways</b> are placed by the proposed MTWP algorithm and the channel capacity of mesh routers varies from 10 [*]Mbps to 25 [*]Mbps with an increment of 5 [*]Mbps. Our results confirm the fact that {{the number of}} <b>gateways</b> can be dramatically reduced by using more powerful mesh routers in the backbone; for example, 6 <b>gateways</b> with mesh router transmitting at 25 [*]Mbps can achieve much better throughput performance than 15 <b>gateways</b> with mesh router transmitting at 10 [*]Mbps.|$|R
