40|$|The main pathway <b>of</b> the <b>disablement</b> process {{consists}} <b>of</b> {{four consecutive}} phases: Pathology (presence of disease/injury), Impairments (dysfunctions/structural abnormalities), Functional Limitations (restrictions in basic physical/mental actions), and Disability (difficulty doing {{activities of daily}} life, ADL). This study determines {{the presence of the}} main pathway <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> in a cohort aged 55 years and older and examines whether progression of the main pathway <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> is accelerated in the presence of depression. Based on baseline (T 1) and two three-year follow-up interviews (T 2 and T 3) from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) in a population-based cohort of 1110 Dutch persons, we first analysed the intermediate effect of the different consecutive phases <b>of</b> the <b>disablement</b> process by means of multiple regression, adjusted for covariates. Then, depression was used as interaction term in multiple regression analyses linking the consecutive phases <b>of</b> the <b>disablement</b> process. We found that Impairments mediated the association between Pathology and Functional Limitations, and that Functional Limitations mediated the association between Impairments and Disability. Depression significantly modified the associations between Pathology and subsequent Impairments, and between Functional Limitations and subsequent Disability. In sum, the main pathway <b>of</b> the <b>disablement</b> process was identified in our sample. In addition, we found an accelerating effect of depression, particularly in the early and late stages of the model.

40|$|Thesis (LLM (Labour Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The {{right to}} be {{entitled}} to compensation for injuries sustained in the course of employment has always been an essential component of basic social security rights. Provision is made in the international sphere by the International Labour Organization and the United Nations. In the regional sphere there are standards that apply within the Southern African Development Community, and on a national level the rights are provided in terms of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, and the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act, 103 of 1993 (COIDA). COIDA provides for a system of no fault compensation for employees who have sustained injuries or contracted occupational diseases during the course of their employment. “No fault compensation” provides that an employee does not have to prove fault with the employer or any other party in {{to be entitled to}} claim compensation. COIDA’s main purpose is to provide for compensation for disablement caused by occupational injuries or diseases sustained or contracted by defined employees {{in the course of their}} employment. Section 49 of COIDA provides for compensation for permanent <b>disablements.</b> In terms <b>of</b> section 49, the Commissioner must assess the permanent <b>disablement</b> <b>of</b> the employee by applying Schedule 2 of COIDA, which stipulates percentages <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> for different injuries or mutilations. By “matching” the injury or mutilation from which the employee is suffering to the corresponding injury or mutilation provided for in Schedule 2, the Commissioner is then able to determine the degree <b>of</b> permanent <b>disablement.</b> Discretions are also granted to the Commissioner in terms of which he is allowed to determine the degree <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> suffered by an employee under certain circumstances. The nature and amount of compensation awarded depend on the degree <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> that the employee is afflicted with. Compensation for permanent disablement may be paid either in a lump sum or a monthly pension depending on the degree <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> determined. Problems arise with the application of both these approaches of determining the permanent <b>disablement</b> <b>of</b> an employee. The guidelines in Schedule 2 have been previously described to be applied “mechanically” with no consideration being given to the individual circumstances of the employee. In practice the discretion granted to the Commissioner in terms of section 49 is often not applied judicially, which has led to numerous objections being lodged against the initial amount of compensation granted. The lack of medical expertise at the initial assessment <b>of</b> the <b>disablement,</b> and the “mechanical application” of Schedule 2, often lead to the incorrect determination of the degree <b>of</b> permanent <b>disablement</b> from which the employee is actually suffering. The determination of the degree <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> is often not consistent with Schedule 2 of COIDA and results in an unjustifiable amount of compensation granted to the employee which holds no relation to the impairment suffered. The core question that needs to be considered is whether and to what extent the employee is still useful for the labour market in the line of his or her employment, and the disablement should be assessed in the light thereof.

40|$|Abstract Background People with Parkinson disease (PD), {{even in the}} {{presence}} of symptomatic relief from medical, surgical, and rehabilitative interventions, face a persistent worsening of disability. This disability is characterized by diminished quality of life, reduced functional mobility, declining performance in activities of daily living and worsening neurological impairments. While evidence has emerged supporting the clinically meaningful benefits of short-term exercise programs on these underlying factors, assertions regarding the effects of sustained programs of exercise and physical activity on the trajectory <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> in PD are made in the absence of direct evidence. Indeed, the natural decline in quality of life and functional mobility in people diagnosed with PD is poorly understood. Moreover, outcome measures commonly used in clinical exercise trials typically do not capture the full spectrum of disability as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). Methods/Design The objective of this multicenter prospective study will be to examine the 2 -year trajectory <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> in a cohort of persons with PD. Two hundred sixty participants will be recruited to produce an expected final sample size of 150 individuals. Participants will be included if they are greater than 40 years of age, have a neurologist confirmed diagnosis of idiopathic PD, and are at Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 through 4. Data will be collected every 6 months during the study period. Primary outcome measures reflecting a broad spectrum <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> will include, but will not be limited to, MDS-UPDRS, Timed Up and Go, Berg Balance Test, Nine Hole Peg Test, PDQ- 39, and directly monitored ambulatory activity. Self-reported exercise and physical activity data also will be recorded. Statistical analyses will be used to characterize the trajectory <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> and examine the influence of its underlying contributing factors. Discussion Tertiary prevention is an important component of contemporary healthcare for individuals living with degenerative disease. For individuals with PD, there is growing recognition that exercise and/or physical activity efforts to slow the rate of functional mobility decline, in particular, may be critical for optimizing quality of life. By describing the natural trajectory <b>of</b> <b>disablement,</b> exercise habits, and physical activity in a cohort of persons with PD, this investigation will establish an important foundation for future intervention research. Specifically, through the evaluation of the influence of sustained exercise and physical activity on disablement, the study will serve as a preliminary step toward developing a randomized controlled trial of long-term exercise in persons with PD. </p...|$|R

40|$|Examining {{the social}} context <b>of</b> <b>disablement,</b> we {{investigated}} how changes in social relations affect loneliness among married older men and women. With longitudinal data on 914 married persons from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), we found that changes {{in the quality of}} marital and nonmarital relations moderate the effect of disability on loneliness in unexpected ways. Increases in negative marital quality buffer the effect of physical disability, while increases in nonmarital support exacerbate it. Although not predicted by existing theory, {{these findings are consistent with}} some prior work suggesting that health-related stressors, like physical disability, condition the meaning of changes in social relations. We find, however, that negative social relations ameliorate loneliness only among disabled married men; disabled married women experience increased loneliness under similar circumstances.

40|$|According to {{contemporary}} fashion, humankind has {{entered a new}} era marked by epochal change, be it a globalized, postmodern, post-industrialist, late modern, high modern, meta-modern, hyper-modern, super-modern, post-Fordist or post-emotional society. In contrast to such claims for epochal disjunction, this thesis identifies fundamental continuities in attitudes and policies toward disablement. Disabled Britons, {{since at least the}} 1970 's, have sought to develop alternative explanations <b>of</b> <b>disablement,</b> exemplified by Mike Oliver's 'Social Model of Disability'. Despite the influence of a socio-political account amongst the activist disability movement, dominant ideology ensures that such pioneering ideas are subject to unrelenting disparagement and disinformation. Despite such ridicule, this thesis shows that claims of a coherent and liberative 'disability policy' in the UK remain grandiloquent, if not entirely inaccurate. Building on the work of Deborah Stone and Mike Oliver, in particular, I will show that, despite modest progress, British disability policy remains indelibly marked by seventeenthcentury assumptions and prejudice. This thesis contributes to the development of disability theory by providing a critical socio-economic analysis of contemporary policy and radical theorising, a task {{that has yet to be}} substantially addressed in the UK. Furthermore, by examining legal, historical, economic, political and social sources, I contend that the absence of contemporary disability policy will be shown to provide explicit benefits to the elite, to the detriment of efforts to promote and protect the emancipation of disabled Britons. The over-arching premise is that socio-political accounts <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> continue to provide unparalleled analytical and theoretical insights into a process <b>of</b> <b>disablement,</b> not least as a particular brand of capitalism is in the ascendancy: the struggle for global hegemony aided by the advancement of a single market modelled on U.

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this work}} {{is to provide a}} general view of the {{conceptual}} elaborations on disablement in the 20 th century and to discuss the role of these different contributions in developing the current concepts <b>of</b> <b>disablement.</b> Method. A review of the literature on conceptual models <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> in the past century has been performed. Results. The 20 th century has witnessed important theoretical considerations on health, diseases and their consequences. These considerations have generated various conceptual models, some of which share the same focus and point of arrival, the so-called ‘Disablement Process’. Among the models that were developed, two stand out, which were drafted and disseminated {{under the aegis of the}} World Health Organization, namely the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (ICIDH) and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), but these are just one part of the conceptual elaboration in the field. Further conceptualization was produced in health and social settings by specialists, self-advocacy associations and activist groups. Conclusions. The current ICF model of the World Health Organization has been translated and recognized in 191 countries; it also incorporates the contribution of self-advocacy associations and it is now recognized by most of them. This model has enjoyed higher visibility than other conceptual models, though its level of development was not higher or more original. To our opinion the ICF is not very clear on the essential choice of the model, i. e., to see disablement as a dynamic process that happens when personal limits collide with socio-environmental needs, rather than as a personal feature. This choice is instead clearer in other models, like Nagi’s 1991, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) model by Brandt and Pope, where the identification of three dimensions (the individual, the environment and the individual-environment interaction) clarifies the role played by all three dimensions within the process <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> and introduces major hints for further considerations on how to create virtuous processes of enablement...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{this article}} we studied the role <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> process {{variables}} in home care utilization in a cross-sectional and in a panel approach among low-functioning community dwelling elderly people. Methods: We analysed data from a prospective follow-up study in The Netherlands (n = 555) and used three outcome variables: professional home care (yes or no) measured {{in the same year}} as the process variables (cross-sectional approach), professional home care (yes or no) also after 2 years (panel-approach: no change) and the new users of professional home care 2 years later (panel-approach: change). Process variables were categorized as pathology, functional limitations, disability, risk factors and psychosocial attributes. Results: Trajectories of home care utilization can be divided into an unchanging part and a changing part. Both parts are not predicted by the same process variables. For instance disability did not predict the new users of professional home care 2 years later, but correlated strongly with the stable users. The changing part was predicted {{by the beginning of the}} process <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> (i. c. pathology).

40|$|We {{estimate}} consumers%u 2019 {{valuation of}} disability insurance using a stochastic lifecycle {{framework in which}} disability is modeled as permanent, involuntary retirement. We base our probabilities of worklimiting disability on 25 years of data from the Current Population Survey and examine {{the changes in the}} disability gradient for different demographic groups over their lifecycle. Our estimates show that a typical consumer {{would be willing to pay}} about 5 percent of expected consumption to eliminate the average disability risk faced by current workers. Only about 2 percentage points reflect the impact of disability on expected lifetime earnings; the larger part is attributable to the uncertainty associated with the threat <b>of</b> <b>disablement.</b> We estimate that no more than 20 percent of mean assets accumulated before voluntary retirement are attributable to disability risks measured for any demographic group in our data. Compared to other reductions in expected utility of comparable amounts, such as a reduction in the replacement rate at voluntary retirement or increases in annual income fluctuations, disability risk generates substantially less pre-retirement saving. Because the probability <b>of</b> <b>disablement</b> is small and the average size of the loss %u 2014 conditional on becoming disabled %u 2014 is large, disability risk is not effectively insured through precautionary saving. ...|$|R
