50|$|Critical {{care nursing}} is {{the field of}} nursing {{with a focus on}} the utmost care of the {{critically}} ill or unstable patients following extensive injury, surgery or life threatening diseases. Critical care nurses can be found working {{in a wide variety of}} environments and specialties, such as general <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units,</b> medical <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units,</b> surgical <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units,</b> trauma <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units,</b> coronary <b>care</b> <b>units,</b> cardiothoracic <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units,</b> burns unit, paediatrics and some trauma center emergency departments. These specialists generally take care of critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation by way of endotracheal intubation and/or titratable vasoactive intravenous medications.|$|R

5|$|Initial {{care in the}} hospital, as in the prehospital setting, aims {{to ensure}} {{adequate}} airway, breathing, cardiovascular function, and spinal immobilization. Imaging of the spine to ascertain presence of SCI may need to wait if emergency surgery is needed to stabilize a life-threatening injury. Acute SCI merits treatment in an <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit,</b> especially injuries to the cervival spinal cord. Patients with SCI need repeated neurological assessments and treatment by neurosurgeons.|$|E
5|$|Respiratory failure {{may require}} {{intubation}} of the trachea and breathing support through mechanical ventilation, generally on an <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit.</b> The need for ventilatory support can be anticipated by measurement of two spirometry-based breathing tests: the {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) and the negative inspiratory force (NIF). An FVC of less than 15ml per kilogram body weight or an NIF of less than 60cmH2O are considered markers of severe respiratory failure.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{depends on}} the underlying cause and whether any complications occur. Rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney impairment in patients with traumatic injury may have a mortality rate of 20%.

5|$|Those {{with severe}} {{encephalopathy}} (stages 3 and 4) {{are at risk}} of obstructing their airway due to decreased protective reflexes such as the gag reflex. This can lead to respiratory arrest. Transferring the person to a higher level of nursing care, such as an <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit,</b> is required and intubation of the airway is often necessary to prevent life-threatening complications (e.g., aspiration or respiratory failure). Placement of a nasogastric tube permits the safe administration of nutrients and medication.|$|E

5|$|When {{taking the}} patient's medical history, {{the subject is}} {{questioned}} about any significant signs or symptoms, such as difficulty in speaking or difficulty in breathing. These may suggest obstructing lesions in various locations within the upper airway, larynx, or tracheobronchial tree. A history of previous surgery (e.g., previous cervical fusion), injury, radiation therapy, or tumors involving the head, neck and upper chest can also provide clues to a potentially difficult intubation. Previous experiences with tracheal intubation, especially difficult intubation, intubation for prolonged duration (e.g., <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit)</b> or prior tracheotomy are also noted.|$|E

40|$|M. Cur. From {{experience}} and observation of decision-making in <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units,</b> {{it has been}} observed that nurses in <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units</b> make clinical decisions, which they can justified, and other decisions which they cannot justified. The last type of clinical decisions are sometimes referred to as gut-feelings or intuition by nurses in <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> It seem further from the observation in respect to clinical decision-making, that clinical decision-making based on intuition are effective, and contribute to better and more complete problemsolving in <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> From the afore-mentioned problemstatement the following two questions were asked in this study, namely: * What is intuition? * What is the role of intuition in clinical decision-making by the nurse in <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units?</b> The objectives of the study is, namely in phase one of the study to analyse the concept intuition, and in phase two to explore and describe the role if intuition in clinical decision-making by the nurse in <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>units.</b> a Philosophical analytical research design were implemented in order to reach these two objectives. The concept intuition was analyse by the method of concept-analysis in order to describe the characteristics of intuition, and to describe a theoretical definition for the study with regards to these characteristics.

5|$|Intravenous {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for procedural sedation (often {{in combination with}} an opioid, such as fentanyl), for preoperative sedation, for the induction of general anesthesia, and for sedation {{of people who are}} ventilated in critical care units. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in impairing memory of endoscopy procedures, but propofol has a quicker recovery time and a better memory-impairing effect. It is the most popular benzodiazepine in the <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> (ICU) because of its short elimination half-life, combined with its water solubility and its suitability for continuous infusion. However, for long-term sedation, lorazepam is preferred due to its long duration of action, and propofol has advantages over midazolam when used in the ICU for sedation, such as shorter weaning time and earlier tracheal extubation.|$|E

5|$|Chronic {{users of}} {{benzodiazepine}} medication who are given midazolam experience reduced therapeutic effects of midazolam, due to tolerance to benzodiazepines. Prolonged infusions with midazolam {{results in the}} development of tolerance; if midazolam is given for a few days or more a withdrawal syndrome can occur. Therefore, preventing a withdrawal syndrome requires that a prolonged infusion be gradually withdrawn, and sometimes, continued tapering of dose with an oral long-acting benzodiazepine such as clorazepate dipotassium. When signs of tolerance to midazolam occur during <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> sedation the addition of an opioid or propofol is recommended. Withdrawal symptoms can include irritability, abnormal reflexes, tremors, clonus, hypertonicity, delirium and seizures, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea. In those with significant dependence, sudden discontinuation may result in withdrawal symptoms such as status epilepticus that may be fatal.|$|E
5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to initial treatment typically requires admission to the <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>unit</b> may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep vein thrombosis is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E
