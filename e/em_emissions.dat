40|$|The {{results of}} recent {{observations}} of the non-thermal electromagnetic (<b>EM)</b> <b>emission</b> at wavelengths of 2. 5 cm, 13 cm, and 21 cm are summarized. After strong impacts of meteorites or spacecrafts (Lunar Prospector) with the Moon's surface, the radio emissions in various frequency ranges were recorded. The most distinctive phenomenon is the appearance of quasi-periodic oscillations with amplitudes of 3 – 10 K during several hours. The mechanism concerning the <b>EM</b> <b>emission</b> from a propagating crack within a piezoactive dielectric medium is considered. The impact may cause the global acoustic oscillations of the Moon. These oscillations lead to the crackening of the Moon's surface. The propagation of a crack within a piezoactive medium is accompanied by the excitation of an alternative current source. It is revealed {{that the source of}} the <b>EM</b> <b>emission</b> is the effective transient magnetization that appears {{in the case of a}} moving crack in piezoelectrics. The moving crack creates additional non-stationary local mechanical stresses around the apex of the crack, which generate the non-stationary electromagnetic field. For the cracks with a length of 0. 1 – 1 µm, the maximum of the <b>EM</b> <b>emission</b> may be in the 1 – 10 GHz range...|$|R

50|$|ESM is {{the passive}} {{detection}} of enemy electromagnetic (<b>EM)</b> <b>emissions.</b> The radiated energy of an emitter (e.g. radar) {{can be detected}} far beyond the range at which it returns a usable result to its user. Modern ESM can identify the actual class of the emitter, which helps identify the unit on which it is used. Passive cross-fixing between a number of units can locate a source to a reasonably small area and give some hint to direction and speed. ESM fixes are placed in three classes: Detected, Tracking and Targeted, depending on {{the accuracy of the}} fix and whether a unit's course and speed has been derived. Of course for ESM to work the enemy must 'co-operate' by using their emitters.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for data and multimedia services, {{as well as}} the ubiquitous nature of the current generation of mobile devices have resulted in continuous network upgrades to support an ever-increasing number of users.

However, given that wireless communication systems operate on radiofrequency waves, the health effects of electromagnetic emission from these systems are increasingly becoming a concern due to the ubiquity of mobile communication devices. In order to address these concerns, we propose two schemes (offline and online) for minimizing the <b>EM</b> <b>emission</b> of users in the uplink of OFDM systems, while maintaining an acceptable quality of service. We formulate our offline EM reduction scheme as a convex optimization problem and solve it through water-filling. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the long-term channel state information of all the users is known. Given that, in practice, long-term channel state information of all the users cannot always be available, we propose our online <b>EM</b> <b>emission</b> reduction scheme, which is based on minimizing the instantaneous transmit energy per bit of each user. Simulation results show that both our proposed schemes significantly minimize the <b>EM</b> <b>emission</b> when compared to the benchmark classic greedy spectral efficiency based scheme and an energy efficiency based scheme.

40|$|As {{one step}} towards a {{systematic}} modeling {{of the electromagnetic}} (<b>EM)</b> <b>emission</b> from an inspiralling black hole binary we consider a simple scenario in which the binary moves in a uniform magnetic field anchored to a distant circumbinary disc. We study this system by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations in which the EM fields are chosen with astrophysically consistent strengths. We consider binaries with spins aligned or anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum and study the dependence of gravitational and EM signals with these spin configurations. Overall {{we find that the}} EM radiation in the lowest l= 2, m= 2 multipole accurately reflects the gravitational one, with identical phase evolutions and amplitudes that differ only by a scaling factor. We also compute the efficiency of the energy <b>emission</b> in <b>EM</b> waves and find that it is given by E^rad_EM/M ~ 10 ^- 15 (M/ 10 ^ 8 M_Sun) ^ 2 (B/ 10 ^ 4 G) ^ 2, hence 13 orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational energy for realistic magnetic fields. The corresponding luminosity is much smaller than the accretion luminosity if the system is accreting at near the Eddington rate. Most importantly, this <b>EM</b> <b>emission</b> is at frequencies of 10 ^- 4 (10 ^ 8 M_Sun/M) Hz, well outside those accessible to astronomical radio observations. As a result, {{it is unlikely that the}} <b>EM</b> <b>emission</b> discussed here can be detected directly and simultaneously with the gravitational-wave one. However, indirect processes, driven by changes in the EM fields behavior could yield observable events. In particular if the accretion rate of the circumbinary disc is small and sufficiently stable over the timescale of the final inspiral, then the <b>EM</b> <b>emission</b> may be observable indirectly as it will alter the accretion rate through the magnetic torques exerted by the distorted magnetic field lines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Various {{research}} {{workers have}} reported EM (electro-magnetic) emissions {{prior to the}} earthquakes or during earthquake sequences. In some cases these <b>EM</b> <b>emissions</b> were consistently found during certain hours of the day. These {{were found to be}} of diurnal and semidiurnal type. <b>EM</b> <b>emissions</b> of semi-diurnal type, spaced in the time domain from the local noontime, were observed in many examples prior to earthquakes/volcanic eruptions. Such emissions were also observed in a very wide frequency band from VLF (very low frequency) to Microwave range. It was also found in these examples that earthquakes/volcanic eruptions occurred simultaneously with these <b>EM</b> <b>emissions.</b> From this study, it can be concluded that the semidiurnal stresses on the earth and moon are primarily caused by the position of the Sun. This paper discusses all these examples in detail and an application for the development of reliable monitoring of precursors for earthquakes/volcanic eruptions in high-seismicity areas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Electromagnetic {{emissions}} leak {{confidential data}} of cryptographic devices. By exploiting such emissions, electromagnetic analysis (EMA) is performed with EM probes to extract secret information from these devices. Owing to the locality of <b>EM</b> <b>emissions,</b> namely, secret information may leak from multiple locations around cryptographic devices, {{it is difficult}} to determine the exact location before conducting an EMA. In this paper, signal variance of <b>EM</b> <b>emissions</b> during encryption is proposed to identify the information leakage of unprotected and protected cryptographic modules. We prove that signal variance is an equivalent metric to Difference of Means (DoM). Thus, by computing the higher signal variances based on near-field scan, the data-dependent <b>EM</b> <b>emissions</b> are disclosed, namely, the leakage locations are found. In addition, a small and low-cost probe is made to verify the proposed EMA on application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementations. The experiment on AES PPRM 1 implementation indicates that misjudgments of leakage are reduced, and the accuracy is improved 48. 6 % compared with existing methods. Moreover, the experiment of EMA against AES WDDL implementation shows that signal variance is also effective in exposing the leakage locations in the presence of countermeasures. The performance of EMA is enhanced...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of complex systems are founded on universal principles {{that can be}} used to describe disparate problems ranging from particle physics to economies of societies. A corollary is that transferring ideas and results from investigators in hitherto disparate areas will cross-fertilize and lead to important new results. In this contribution, we investigate the existence of a universal behavior, if any, in solar flares, magnetic storms, earthquakes and pre-seismic electromagnetic (<b>EM)</b> <b>emissions,</b> extending the work recently published by Balasis et al. (2011 a). A common characteristic in the {{dynamics of}} the above-mentioned phenomena is that their energy release is basically fragmentary, i. e. the associated events are being composed of elementary building blocks. By analogy with earthquakes, the magnitude of the magnetic storms, solar flares and pre-seismic <b>EM</b> <b>emissions</b> can be appropriately defined. Then the key question we can ask in the frame of complexity is whether the magnitude distribution of earthquakes, magnetic storms, solar flares and pre-fracture <b>EM</b> <b>emissions</b> obeys the same law.

Using the Fermi/LAT observational results on gamma-ray flux from GRBs, the GRB neutrino emission is limited to be below ~ 20 GeV/m^ 2 per GRB event on average, which is independent of the unknown GRB proton luminosity.

40|$|International audienceAn {{important}} question in geophysics is whether earthquakes (EQs) can be anticipated {{prior to their}} occurrence. Pre-seismic electromagnetic (<b>EM)</b> <b>emissions</b> provide a promising window through which the dynamics of EQ preparation can be investigated. However, the existence of precursory features in pre-seismic <b>EM</b> <b>emissions</b> is still debatable: in principle, {{it is difficult to}} prove associations between events separated in time, such as EQs and their EM precursors. The scope of this paper is the investigation of the pre-seismic EM activity in terms of complexity. A basic reason for our interest in complexity is the striking similarity in behavior close to irreversible phase transitions among systems that are otherwise quite different in nature. Interestingly, theoretical studies (Hopfield, 1994; Herz and Hopfield 1995; Rundle et al., 1995; Corral et al., 1997) suggest that the EQ dynamics at the final stage and neural seizure dynamics should have many similar features and can be analyzed within similar mathematical frameworks. Motivated by this hypothesis, we evaluate the capability of linear and non-linear techniques to extract common features from brain electrical activities and pre-seismic <b>EM</b> <b>emissions</b> predictive of epileptic seizures and EQs respectively. The results suggest that a unified theory may exist for the ways in which firing neurons and opening cracks organize themselves to produce a large crisis, while the preparation of an epileptic shock or a large EQ can be studied in terms of ''Intermittent Criticality''...|$|E
