The Football Association launched an inquiry and agreed with McCombie, stating that it was a [...] "resigning/win/draw bonus".

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present a New Keynesian {{quantitative}} model with endogenous investment and a stock-market sector to shed further light on two unsettled issues: whether central banks should include some financial indicator in their policy rules, and what indicator {{may be expected}} to generate better stabilization performance. For comparative purposes, the authors replicate the policy framework and assessment strategy of the well-known no-inclusion model of Bernanke-Gertler (1999, 2000) and assess performance of five policy rules. Two of these are traditional Taylor rules (i. e., do not incorporate financial indicators) that differ in the relative weight they put on output and inflation gaps. The other three are <b>financial</b> Taylor <b>rules.</b> These involve the addition of one financial indicator in each case. Specifically, the deviation from trend of stock prices, of Tobin's q (the rate of change in stock prices relative to capital stock) and of investment. The authors obtain results that are at variance with Bernanke-Gertler, first, because the best performing rule of the traditional rules is output aggressive instead of inflation aggressive and, second, because the <b>financial</b> <b>rule</b> with Tobin's q outperforms the traditional inflation-aggressive one under all dimensions and cases. However, the authors cannot draw a univocal conclusion as regards the comparison between the <b>financial</b> <b>rule</b> with Tobin's q and the traditional but output aggressive rule.
