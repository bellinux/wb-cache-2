5|$|Due to the {{physical}} similarities which they share, the group 12 elements {{can be found in}} many common situations. Zinc and cadmium are commonly used as anti-corrosion (galvanization) agents as they will attract all local oxidation until they completely corrode. These protective coatings can be applied to other metals through by <b>hot-dip</b> galvanizing a substance into the molten form of the metal, or through the process of electroplating which may be passivated by the use of chromate salts. Group 12 elements are also used in electrochemistry as they may act {{as an alternative to the}} standard hydrogen electrode in addition to being a secondary reference electrode.|$|E
5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (<b>hot-dip</b> galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in deodorants), zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. 0 Cr 18 Ni 10 Ti {{austenitic}} stainless steels were coated by <b>hot-dipping</b> in molten Al bath and molten Al- 5 wt. % Si bath. The cyclic oxidation resistance behavior of both <b>hot-dipping</b> Al samples and <b>hot-dipping</b> Al- 5 Si samples at 900 ℃ for 24 cycles have been investigated using muffle furnace. The element distribution, phase composition and morphology of the aluminide layer and the oxide film were characterized by SEM and EDS. The results show the coating layers on both <b>hot-dipping</b> Al samples and <b>hot-dipping</b> Al- 5 Si samples after 24 cycles at 900 ℃ consisted of four layers, in the sequence of Al 2 O 3 film, outer layer with black phase and grey phase, intermediate MAl layer, Al solution layer from the external topcoat to substrate. The thickness of intermediate MAl layer of <b>hot-dipping</b> Al- 5 Si samples was lower than the thickness of MAl layer of <b>hot-dipping</b> Al samples. Some cracks were found on intermediate MAl layer of <b>hot-dipping</b> Al samples after 24 cycles at 900 ℃.

40|$|High-temperature {{corrosion}} {{of carbon}} steel in N 2 / 0. 1 % H 2 S mixed gas at 600 – 800 °C for 50 – 100 h was studied after <b>hot-dipping</b> in the aluminum molten bath. <b>Hot-dipping</b> {{resulted in the}} formation of the Al topcoat and the Al-Fe alloy layer firmly adhered on the substrate. The Al-Fe alloy layer consisted primarily of a wide, tongue-like Al 5 Fe 2 layer and narrow Al 3 Fe layer. When corroded at 800 °C for 100 h, the Al topcoat partially oxidized to the protective but non-adherent α-Al 2 O 3 layer, and the interdiffusion converted the Al-Fe alloy layer to an (Al 13 Fe 4, AlFe 3) -mixed layer. The interdiffusion also lowered the microhardness of the <b>hot-dipped</b> steel. The α-Al 2 O 3 layer formed on the <b>hot-dipped</b> steel protected the carbon steel against corrosion. Without the Al <b>hot-dipping,</b> the carbon steel failed by forming a thick, fragile, and non-protective FeS scale...|$|R

25|$|The use of zinc {{chloride}} as a flux, sometimes {{in a mixture}} with ammonium chloride (see also Zinc ammonium chloride), involves the production of HCl and its subsequent reaction with surface oxides. Zinc chloride forms two salts with ammonium chloride: (NH4)ZnCl4 and (NH4)3ClZnCl4, which decompose on heating liberating HCl, just as {{zinc chloride}} hydrate does. The action of zinc chloride/ammonium chloride fluxes, for example, in the <b>hot-dip</b> galvanizing process produces H2 gas and ammonia fumes.|$|E
500|$|Zinc is more {{reactive}} than iron or {{steel and}} thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate ( [...] forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts {{even after the}} zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by <b>hot-dip</b> galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hot-dip</b> {{galvanized}} {{surfaces are}} not generally {{tested in a}} salt spray test (see ISO 1461 or ISO 10684). <b>Hot-dip</b> galvanizing produces zinc carbonates when exposed to a natural environment, thus protecting the coating metal and reducing the corrosion rate. The zinc carbonates are not produced when a <b>hot-dip</b> galvanized specimen is exposed to a salt spray fog, therefore this testing method does not give an accurate measurement of corrosion protection. ISO 9223 gives the guidelines for proper measurement of corrosion resistance for <b>hot-dip</b> galvanized specimens.|$|E

40|$|Using laser {{scanning}} confocal microscope, failure process of aluminized ductile iron samples were in-situ observed during three-point bending test, while crack initiation and propagation mechanism were analyzed {{in the area}} of coating and matrix. The results show that for <b>hot-dipped</b> samples in Al, cracks mainly initiate in the Fe-Al alloy coating under tensile stress, then induce the tearing of ferrite and the peeling of graphite in the adjacent matrix. Thereby cracks spread to the inner matrix in shortest route between graphite and ferrite, in the direction nearly vertical to tensile stress. In case of compression stress, aluminized alloy layer is crushed and aluminum layer is peeled off,which having little influence on the failure of matrix. For <b>hot-dipped</b> samples in Al- 3. 7 Si- 1. 0 RE, failure mechanism under tensile stress {{is similar to that of}} <b>hot-dipped</b> samples in Al; under compression stress, aluminum and Fe-Al alloy coatings are disengaged from matrix, exhibits failure occurring in the ferrite matrix...|$|R

50|$|The {{protection}} {{provided by}} <b>hot-dip</b> galvanizing is insufficient for products {{that will be}} constantly exposed to corrosive materials such as acids, including acid rain in outdoor uses. For these applications, more expensive stainless steel is preferred. Some nails made today are galvanized. Nonetheless, electroplating is used on its own for many outdoor applications because it is cheaper than <b>hot-dip</b> zinc coating and looks good when new. Another reason not to use <b>hot-dip</b> zinc coating is that for bolts and nuts of size M10 (US 3/8") or smaller, the thick hot-dipped coating fills in {{too much of the}} threads, which reduces strength (because the dimension of the steel prior to coating must be reduced for the fasteners to fit together). This means that for cars, bicycles, and many other light mechanical products, the practical alternative to electroplating bolts and nuts is not <b>hot-dip</b> zinc coating, but making the fasteners from stainless steel.|$|E

40|$|Material {{variations}} {{and process}} modifications {{have been studied}} to determine their effects on the acceptable range of resistance spot welding conditions for galvanized steel sheet. The material variations studied include zinc coating integrity, structure, composition, thickness, roughness, oil, and the amount and type of Fe-Zn intermetallics. Process modifications studied include upsloping and downsloping of the weld current, preheat current, postheat current, electrode tip geometry, and applied force. It was found that <b>hot-dipped</b> galvanized materials with coatings which have a very thin Fe-Zn alloy layer have {{a wider range of}} acceptable welding conditions than the commercial galvannealed products, which have a fully alloyed Fe-Zn coating. The decreased lobe width of the galvannealed material is due to the discontinuous Fe-Zn coating structure and morphology. Small variations in the thickness of the coatings studied have no significant effect on the welding current range. Surface roughness of the coating has no effect on lobe width. Ups loping and downs loping of the weld current increase the welding range of <b>hot-dipped</b> products when using truncated cone electrodes, whereas sloped current has no advantage for galvannealed or uncoated materials.
