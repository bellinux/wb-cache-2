The erection of a house-wall, come to think of it, is an astonishingly tedious and complex business; the final result exceedingly unsatisfactory. It has been my lot recently to follow in detail the process of building a private dwelling-house, and the solemn succession of deliberate, respectable, perfectly satisfied men, who have contributed each so many days of his life to this accumulation of weak compromises, has enormously intensified my constitutional amazement at my fellow-creatures. The chief ingredient in this particular house-wall is the common brick, burnt earth, and but one step from the handfuls of clay of the ancestral mud hut, small in size and permeable to damp. Slowly, day by day, the walls grew tediously up, to a melody of tinkling trowels. These bricks are joined by mortar, which is mixed in small quantities, and must vary very greatly in its quality and properties throughout the house. In order to prevent the obvious evils of a wall of porous and irregular baked clay and lime mud, a <b>damp</b> <b>course</b> of tarred felt, which cannot possibly last more than a few years, was inserted about a foot from the ground. Then the wall, being quite insufficient to stand the heavy drift of weather to which it is exposed, was dabbled over with two coatings of plaster on the outside, the outermost being given a primitive picturesqueness by means of a sham surface of rough-cast pebbles and white-wash, while within, to conceal the rough discomfort of the surface, successive coatings of plaster, and finally, paper, were added, with a wood-skirting at the foot thrice painted. Everything in this was hand work, the laying of the bricks, the dabbing of the plaster, the smoothing of the paper; it is a house built of hands--and some I saw were bleeding hands--just as in the days of the pyramids, when the only engines were living men. The whole confection is now undergoing incalculable chemical reactions between its several parts. Lime, mortar, and microscopical organisms are producing undesigned chromatic effects in the paper and plaster; the plaster, having methods of expansion and contraction of its own, crinkles and cracks; the skirting, having absorbed moisture and now drying again, opens its joints; the rough-cast coquettes with the frost and opens chinks and crannies for the humbler creation. I fail to see the necessity of (and, accordingly, I resent bitterly) all these coral-reef methods. Better walls than this, and better and less life-wasting ways of making them, are surely possible. In the wall in question, concrete would have been cheaper and better than bricks if only [...] "the men" [...] had understood it. But I can dream at last of much more revolutionary affairs, of a thing running to and fro along a temporary rail, that will squeeze out wall as one squeezes paint from a tube, and form its surface with a pat or two as it sets. Moreover, I do not see at all why the walls of small dwelling-houses should be so solid as they are. There still hangs about us the monumental traditions of the pyramids. It ought to be possible to build sound, portable, and habitable houses of felted wire-netting and weather-proofed paper upon a light framework. This sort of thing is, no doubt, abominably ugly at present, but that is because architects and designers, being for the most part inordinately cultured and quite uneducated, are unable to cope with its fundamentally novel problems. A few energetic men might at any time set out to alter all this. And with the inevitable revolutions that must come about in domestic fittings, and which I hope to discuss more fully in the next paper, it is open to question whether many ground landlords may not find they have work for the house-breakers rather than wealth unlimited falling into their hands when the building leases their solicitors so ingeniously draw up do at last expire.|$|E

5000|$|Having {{falling into}} {{disrepair}} in the 1990s the Kaiserbahnhof {{is now being}} restored to its 1865 state. The initial works beginning {{in the summer of}} 2010 involve removing the 1912 additions which converted the building to three apartments, making the building watertight and connecting water, gas and power, repairing and replacing the roof, repairing and cleaning the brickwork. In 2011, the windows at the first floor level were restored, the external brickwork repointed and the two decorative north towers rebuilt. The 2012 works have focused on the restoration of the two south towers, repairs to the exterior brickwork, the garden and preparing for more extensive repairs to the interior, particularly on the ground floor. The restored Kaiserbahnhof will include a small cafe and museum. The restoration {{was the subject of a}} front page story in the Markische Allgemeine newspaper of 12 June 2010 under the title: The neue Kaiser. and in the same newspaper on 10 August 2011 under a similar title: Mister Macky ist der neue Kaiser. [...] It has also been the subject of a story in the New Zealand Herald's Viva Magazine of 29 April 2011 under the title: At Home: The Station Master. There has also been an article by expat New Zealander Andre Gifkins on 4 September 2012 in Slow Berlin. During 2013 further restoration works were undertaken being primarily incorporating a <b>damp</b> <b>course</b> barrier, laying concrete floors in the ground floor and laying drainage pipes for surface and ground water to a collection pit built in the garden to the south of the building. Work started on the replacement ground floor windows in 2015, with this work being due to be completed in September 2015. The interior restoration of the King's Room, the Salon for the Attendants and the Vestibule commenced in January 2015 and is due to be completed later in 2015. These works have been the subject of much debate as to the methodology. Whether to do a partial restoration, adopting techniques successfully applied to Berlin's Neues Museum, to leave the interior largely 'as is' or to undertake a complete restoration, so that the interiors will look much like they did when the building was completed in 1865. After much discussion the decision has been made to undertake a complete restoration.|$|E

The main reasons for introducing a roll damping system are to prevent cargo damage and to increase crew effectiveness and passenger comfort.
