5|$|Jane later ends her {{relationship}} with Valéry because {{it feels like a}} betrayal of her friendship with Brian, and Brian's first novel is published by Galassi. After some years, Brian is walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> his wife, Kiva (Jocelyn DeBoer), and their two year old son. They run into Arielle, Valéry and their now-teenage children outside the Guggenheim. Valéry asks about Jane, and Brian tells him that she is married with a son. Arielle shows Brian subtly that she still wears the ring he gave to her before they part again.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the episode were cut prior to broadcast. The opening scene in Jerry's car, in which George {{discusses}} breaking up with Marlene, originally had George proposing that he would stage his own kidnapping while walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> Marlene, and then hide out until she {{had given up on}} him. Although it was cut before the episode's broadcast, this scene was included on the Seinfeld Volume 1 DVD set. Another scene which was cut featured Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) entering Jerry's apartment carrying a plate with cantaloupe on toothpicks. Originally, the scene in which Jerry tells George that he is dating Marlene took place in a library, with a librarian repeatedly shushing George and Jerry and kicking them out of the library {{at the end of the}} scene. The location was changed to Monk's Cafe because the dialogue had nothing to do with a library.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms into the camera from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a picture on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the window, where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E

25|$|Initially in 1914, {{plans for}} an art gallery were drawn up by New York {{architect}} Richard A. Walker, for a building to cost $14,000. The organization at this time was deciding between the purchase a portion of Florence Griswold's property, and a larger property further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>With</b> the outbreak of World War I in 1914, plans for raising funds for {{the building of the}} gallery were delayed.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the props}} {{developed}} for the video {{was a pair of}} sunglasses made of wire. According to Gaga, she imagined [...] "a downtown, bad-ass kid walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> his buddies, grabbing a pair of pliers, and making a pair of sunglasses out of a fence on the street". She wore them on the opening shot of the music video along with a chain link hood garment, saying that [...] "they look so hard. It looks like I plied them right out of the fence and put them on my face".|$|E

Activities at these festivals include pulling the heads off live chickens, throwing live turkeys {{off of a}} church tower, bullfighting, chasing bulls off of piers into the sea, chasing bulls <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> flaming brands attached to their horns, and dragging a bull by its horns and forcing it to bow {{in front of the}} statue of a saint before being slaughtered. An estimated 11,000 bulls were tortured and killed in Spanish festivals in 2014.|$|R
50|$|Pizza {{first made}} its {{appearance}} in the United States {{with the arrival of}} Italian immigrants in the late 19th century and was very popular among large Italian populations in New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Saint Louis. In the late 19th century, pizza was introduced by peddlers who walked up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> a metal washtub of pizzas on their heads, selling their pizzas at two cents a slice. It was not long until small cafes and groceries began offering pizzas to their Italian American communities.|$|R
500|$|When Elaine finally arrives, she {{explains}} that Kramer promised her a lift if she would wait in his car for two minutes. He returned over twenty minutes later, and the car had been towed for being illegally parked. She was eventually forced {{to walk to the}} restaurant. Alton, returning from the bathroom, greets Elaine and tells Jerry and [...] "chorus boy" [...] George {{that they are going to}} a Pakistani restaurant five blocks away. On their way out, they notice it is snowing. Jerry knows snow would ruin his suede jacket and asks Alton if they can take a cab, but Alton replies that it is only a few blocks away. George suggests that Jerry could turn the jacket inside out, but because of the candy stripe lining, Alton notices and tells him to turn it back, saying he looks [...] "like a damn fool" [...] and that he's [...] "not going to walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> me and my daughter dressed like that." [...] George then reminds Jerry that the restaurant is only a few blocks away; Jerry, reluctantly, puts his jacket back to normal.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear". While discussing It's Not Me, It's You, Allen stated that her intention was to make [...] "bigger sounding, more ethereal songs, real songs. [...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} I hope it reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
2500|$|Addams {{spent her}} {{childhood}} playing outdoors, reading indoors, and attending Sunday school. When she was four she contracted tuberculosis of the spine, known as Potts's disease, which caused a curvature in her spine and lifelong health problems. This made it complicated {{as a child}} to function with the other children, considering she had a limp and could not run as well. As a child, {{she thought she was}} [...] "ugly" [...] and later remembered wanting not to embarrass her father, when he was dressed in his Sunday best, by walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E

5000|$|An early {{description}} of the drunkard's cloak appears in Ralph Gardiner's England's Grievance Discovered, first published in 1655. [...] A John Willis claimed to have travelled to Newcastle and seen"men drove up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>with</b> a great tub, or barrel, opened in the sides, {{with a hole in}} one end, to put through their heads, and to cover their shoulders and bodies, <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> small of their legs, and then close the same, called the new fashioned cloak, and so make them march to the view of all beholders; and this is their punishment for drunkards, or the like." ...|$|R

2500|$|The Chili Peppers {{were again}} without a drummer and {{were forced to}} hold open auditions. Denise Zoom, {{a friend of the}} band, {{suggested}} Chad Smith, claiming he was the best drummer she had ever seen. The band agreed to audition Smith, but he was late and the last drummer to audition. Kiedis recalled {{the first time he saw}} Smith by saying, [...] "I spied this big lummox walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>with</b> a really bad Guns N' Roses hairdo and clothes that were not screaming I've got style". Smith was a six-foot three-inch tall drummer who, according to Flea, [...] "lit a fire under our asses". From the moment they started jamming, Smith and Flea instantly found chemistry. Smith was a hard-hitting musician with whom the Chili Peppers believed they would create a strong relationship. Kiedis said the audition with Smith [...] "left the band in a state of frenzied laughter, that we couldn't shake out of for a half an hour". Smith was so much different from the other three. Kiedis, Flea and Frusciante were heavily influenced by punk rock, whereas Smith's taste in heavy metal music and his biker appearance contrasted with their punk rock views. Kiedis informed Smith he would be hired on one condition: as an initiation to the band, Smith had to cut his long hair. He refused, though Kiedis was not about to argue with the much larger Smith. Smith was hired as the band's fourth drummer on December 3, 1988.|$|E

60|$|They {{answered}} to the appeal. The bodies already {{collected at}} the exchange and cattle market moved forward, and from every house the men poured out. The Spanish columns had already divided, and were pouring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> savage cries. <b>The</b> German cavalry of Havre under Van Eude at once deserted, and joining the Spanish cavalry fell upon the townsmen. In vain the burghers and such of the German infantry as remained faithful strove to resist their assailants. Although they had been beaten off in their assaults upon breaches, the Spaniards had ever proved themselves invincible on level ground; and now, inspired alike by the fury for slaughter and the lust for gold, there was no withstanding them.|$|R

5000|$|On 25 September {{the junta}} {{threatened}} demonstrators with military force and placed army trucks at Shwedagon Pagoda, the assembly point for monks leading the protests. Witnesses said 5,000 monks and laypeople marched into the Shwedagon.

Vehicles mounted with loudspeakers toured central Yangon, blaring warnings of military action. [...] "People are not to follow, encourage or take part in these marches. Action will be taken against those who violate this order," [...] the broadcasts said, invoking a law allowing {{the use of military force}} to break up illegal protests. Reuters reported that the detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi had been moved to the Insein Prison on Sunday, a day after she appeared in front of her house to greet marching monks.|$|R
60|$|Certain it is {{that the}} general vindicated his {{character}} by the most vehement oaths and protestations, and put every man out of the ranks of honor who dared to doubt his integrity. Moreover, on returning to New Amsterdam, he paraded up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>with</b> a crew of hard swearers at his heels--sturdy bottle companions, whom he gorged and fattened, and who were ready to bolster him through all the courts of justice--heroes of his own kidney, fierce-whiskered, broad-shouldered, colbrand-looking swaggerers--not one of whom but looked as though he could eat up an ox, and pick his teeth with the horns. These lifeguard men quarreled all his quarrels, were ready to fight all his battles, and scowled at every man that turned up his nose at the general, as though they would devour him alive. Their conversation was interspersed with oaths like minute-guns, and every bombastic rhodomontade was rounded off by a thundering execration, like a patriotic toast honored with a discharge of artillery.|$|R
