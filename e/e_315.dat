40|$|The {{chitinase}} of Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) {{is required}} for the characteristic liquefaction of baculovirus-infected insect larvae. Alignments of the putative active sites of a range of chitinases revealed two highly conserved residues, glutamate and aspartate, which have been proposed to constitute the catalytic residues of the active site. These residues were mutated in the AcMNPV chitinase. Three recombinant viruses were generated, AcchiAD 311 G, AcchiAE 315 G and AcchiAD 311 G <b>E</b> <b>315</b> G, which contained mutations at either the glutamate, the aspartate or both. It was demonstrated that chitinase protein production was unaffected by the mutation of these residues. However, mutation of both residues resulted in the attenuation of chitinolytic activity and the cessation of liquefaction of Trichoplusia ni larvae infected with AcchiAD 311 G <b>E</b> <b>315</b> G. Mutagenesis of the glutamate residue led to a reduction in exochitinase activity and a delay in the appearance of endochitinase activity. In addition, larvae infected with this virus, AcchiAE 315 G, liquefied more slowly than those larvae infected with wild-type AcMNPV. Mutagenesis of the aspartate residue resulted in a reduction of exochitinase activity but an unexpected enhancement of endochitinolytic activity. Liquefaction of AcchiAD 311 G-infected larvae was observed at the sam...|$|E

Two types of TMZ granulations were tested, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>315</b> - 500 µm and zeolite – powder, which were synthesized by sol-gel method. TMZ materials were characterized by SEM-EDAX and XRD. Their application by Jar-test experiments showed the enhanced efficiency of coagulation related to NOM removal. The concentration of NOM before and after TMZ application was determined as UV 254 absorbance and non-purgeable organic carbon (NPOC) parameter.

40|$|We {{have used}} sulfhydryl-modifying {{reagents}} {{to investigate the}} regulation of G-protein-activated inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels via their cytoplasmic domains. Modification of either the conserved N-terminal cysteines (GIRK 1 C 53 and GIRK 2 C 65) or the middle C-terminal cysteines (GIRK 1 C 310 and GIRK 2 C 321) independently inhibited GIRK 1 /GIRK 2 heteromeric channels. With the exception of GIRK 2 C 65, these cysteines were relatively inaccessible to large modifying reagents. The accessibility was further reduced by a mutation {{at the end of}} the second transmembrane domain that stabilized the open state of the channel. Thus it is unlikely that these cysteines line the permeation pathway of the open pore. Cysteines introduced 3 and 6 amino acids upstream of GIRK 2 C 321 (G 318 C and <b>E</b> <b>315</b> C) were considerably more accessible. The effect of modification was dependent on the charge of the reagent. Modification of <b>E</b> <b>315</b> C in GIRK 2 and E 304 C in GIRK 1 by sodium (2 -sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate (MTSES(-)) increased the current by approximately 17 -fold, whereas modification by 2 -aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrochloride (MTSEA(+)), abolished the current. There was no effect on single-channel conductance. Thus a switch in charge at this middle C-terminal position was sufficient to gate the channel open and closed. This glutamate is conserved in all members of the Kir family. The E 303 K mutation in Kir 2. 1 inhibits channel function and causes Andersen's syndrome in humans (Plaster, N.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that multi{{vesicular}} bodies (MVBs) /endosomes-mediated vesicular trafficking may play key roles in plant immunity and cell death. However, the molecular regulation is poorly understood in rice. Here we report the identification and characterization of a MVBs-localized AAA ATPase LRD 6 - 6 in rice. Disruption of LRD 6 - 6 leads to enhanced immunity and cell death in rice. The ATPase activity and homo-dimerization of LRD 6 - 6 is essential for its regulation on plant immunity and cell death. An ATPase inactive mutation (LRD 6 - 6 <b>E</b> <b>315</b> Q) leads to dominant-negative inhibition in plants. The LRD 6 - 6 protein co-localizes with the MVBs marker protein RabF 1 /ARA 6 and interacts with ESCRT-III components OsSNF 7 and OsVPS 2. Further analysis reveals that LRD 6 - 6 is required for MVBs-mediated vesicular trafficking and inhibits the biosynthesis of antimicrobial compounds.

40|$|In 2014, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC) funded {{a project}} titled "Familiarization and Detection of Green Monopropellants" {{utilizing}} Independent Research and Technology Development (IR&TD) and Center Innovation Fund (CIF) funding. The {{purpose of the}} project was to evaluate methods of detection for ammonium dinitramide (ADN) and hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN). An Engineering Services Contract (ESC) task order was created with the scope of evaluation of several methods of detecting ADN- and HAN-based propellants, as well as development of methods for detection. Detection methods include developed methods such as colorimetric indicating absorbent socks, and commercial-off-the- shelf (COTS) units for ammonia detection. An additional goal of the task order was for ESC to become familiar with ADN's and HAN's material properties and material compatibility. Two approaches were initially investigated as possible methods for the detection of HAN (or AFM <b>315</b> <b>E)</b> and ADN (or LMP- 103 S). These approaches were colorimetric analysis and instrumentation-based COTS vapor sensors utilization. Initial testing showed that the relatively non-existent vapor pressure of the AF-M <b>315</b> <b>E</b> (of which HAN is a major component) propellant would make the use of COTS sensors difficult for real-time area monitoring of HAN; a small response was detected through the use of active COTS sensors, including the RAE Systems MultiRAE Lite and Drager X-act (registered) 5000, but the levels detected were below the threshold limit value for the toxic gas ammonia. Therefore, a detection system ased upon a colorimetric indicator impregnated into an absorbent material was developed. Preliminary analysis (ESC- 245 -FDG- 001) identified a particularly outstanding candidate as a colorimetric indicator for the detection of the presence of AF-M <b>315</b> <b>E</b> {{in the form of a}} Methyl Red (Basic) indicator. Materials impregnated with this indicator exhibit significant color change and the materials are not susceptible to interference from exposure to water or carbon dioxide. The completed detection system for HAN/AF-M <b>315</b> <b>E</b> consists of absorbent socks packed with Fisher Universal Spill Absorbent capable of absorbing and containing any propellant spills that they come into contact with along with indicating wipes. The absorbent socks are also chemically treated with a Methyl Red (Basic) indicator solution to provide the end user with a visual indication that a leak has occurred and proper protective precautions must be undertaken. An added benefit of this detection system is that the absorbent socks should neutralize/absorb any commodity that it comes into contact with (until saturation is reached). Additional adsorbent socks can be deployed until a color change is not seen, indicating that the HAN/AF-M <b>315</b> <b>E</b> contamination has been contained. The indicating wipes provide the user the opportunity to wipe surfaces to determine if there is any HAN/AF-M <b>315</b> <b>E</b> or HAN/AFM <b>315</b> <b>E</b> residue present. The wipes should allow the detection of fuel levels that may be too small to detect with the absorbent socks. The development of a detection system for the ADN/LMP- 103 S focused on the use of various COTS sensors used as real-time area monitoring devices and personal dosimeters. These COTS based sensor systems were of several different types, including both actively pumped and diffusion-based passive systems, as well as a "rope"-type chemical sensing cable. The results highlighted some of the major differences between the two monopropellants undergoing evaluation. Unlike HAN, ADN (which is the major constituent of LMP- 103 S) exhibits a much more volatile nature in comparison to AF-M <b>315</b> <b>E.</b> In fact, testing showed that a large percentage of the fuel was lost during the sampling measurement (greater than 10 percent by mass); although this testing cannot tell if the volatile component is the ADN itself or another component of the monopropellant solution. Not surprisingly, all four of the procured vapor-based COTS sensors showed positive results when exposed to solutions of the LMP- 103 S (ESC- 245 -FDG- 002). The completed detection system for ADN/LMP- 103 S consists of a combination of two of the tested COTS sensor systems, the RAE Systems MultiRAE Lite and the BW Technologies GasAlert Extreme. These systems are meant to be used in conjunction with one another, which allows for the end-user to have both real-time area monitoring (MultiRAE Lite) as well as a personal dosimeter device (GasAlert Extreme) which can be worn as additional personal protective equipment. An stainless steel extension wand was fabricated and included in the detection system for the MultiRAE Lite to allow for more remote sensing, and connects via the active pumping inlet of the sensor. As stated, the final results of this testing resulted in the production of two "kits" which can be used for the detection of HAN/AF-M <b>315</b> <b>E</b> and ADN/LMP- 103 s (ESC- 245 -FDG- 003) ...|$|R

Objective: To analyze the speech perception in children with a normal hearing in different noise situations. Method: Way of study transverse section. The Brazilian Hearing in Noise Test (HINT) was performed in 21 children aged between 7 and 14 with a standard hearing and no cognitive alterations. The sentence lists were randomly used in these situations: silence (S), frontal noise (FN); right-side noise (RN); left-side noise (LN); noise at 180 o. (RT) and a comparison between the result of the compound noise (CN) and the diffuse noise in four sound areas at 45 o; 135 o; 225 o <b>e</b> <b>315</b> o (4 BXS). Results: The statistical analysis showed a significant difference among the following situations: RN with FN; BN with FN; and it was worse with 4 BXS, where a difference for RN, BN, CN, LN and FN was found.

40|$|The {{attenuated}} Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) strain SA 14 - 14 - 2 {{has been}} successfully utilized to prevent JEV infection; however, the attenuation determinants have not been fully elucidated. The envelope (E) protein of the attenuated JEV SA 14 - 14 - 2 strain {{differs from that of}} the virulent parental SA 14 strain at eight amino acid positions (E 107, E 138, E 176, E 177, E 264, E 279, <b>E</b> <b>315,</b> and E 439). Here, we investigated the SA 14 - 14 - 2 -attenuation determinants by mutating E 107, E 138, E 176, E 177, and E 279 in SA 14 - 14 - 2 to their status in the parental virulent strain and tested the replication capacity, neurovirulence, neuroinvasiveness, and mortality associated with the mutated viruses in mice, as compared with those of JEV SA 14 - 14 - 2 and SA 14. Our findings indicated that revertant mutations at the E 138 or E 107 position significantly increased SA 14 - 14 - 2 virulence, whereas other revertant mutations exhibited significant increases in neurovirulence only when combined with E 138, E 107, and other mutations. Revertant mutations at all eight positions in the E protein resulted in the highest degree of SA 14 - 14 - 2 virulence, although this was still lower than that observed in SA 14. These results demonstrated the critical role of the viral E protein in controlling JEV virulence and identified the amino acids at the E 107 and E 138 positions as the key determinants of SA 14 - 14 - 2 neurovirulence...|$|E
40|$|The 1542 Inventory of Whitehall Palace lists over 4, 000 items {{owned by}} King Henry VIII. It {{includes}} the earliest English royal catalogue of paintings, an alphabetical list of Henry's books, {{as well as}} tapestries, cloth, clothing, glassware and ceramics, maps, musical instruments and plate. This rich assortment of objects was charged upon Sir Anthony Denny, the Palace Keeper, and was housed within the king's privy lodging at Whitehall. Denny {{was a member of}} the Privy Chamber, a follower of the reformed faith and a confidant of the king. His role as the keeper of Whitehall Palace is less well known, but there is a wealth of documentation which allows the study of this aspect of his career in some depth. The first work of the current volume examines in detail Denny's responsibilities and the development of Whitehall Palace into the first permanently furnished English royal residence. In addition to the 1542 Inventory (PRO <b>E</b> <b>315</b> / 160), the second volume contains three further transcriptions: PRO E 101 / 472 / 2 and BL Landsdowne Rolls 14 and 15. This group of four complementary documents provides a unique glimpse into the way in which the Palace of Whitehall was furnished and managed in the 1540 s and how Henry VIII's possessions were redistributed amongst his properties on his death. These volumes act as a companion to the recent publication of the post-mortem 1547 Inventory of Henry VIII's possessions. To this end, a concordance between the 1542 and 1547 inventories is given, along with three further concordances and five appendices. A glossary and brief biographies of individuals mentioned are also included...|$|E
40|$|G protein-coupled inward {{rectifiers}} (GIRKs) are activated {{directly by}} G protein βγ subunits, whereas classical inward rectifiers (IRKs) are constitutively active. We {{found that a}} glutamate residue of GIRK 2 (<b>E</b> <b>315),</b> located on a hydrophobic domain of the C terminus, is crucial for the channel activation. This glutamate (or aspartate) residue is conserved in {{all members of the}} Kir family. Substitution of alanine for the glutamate on GIRK 1, GIRK 2, and IRK 2, expressed in HEK 293 cells, greatly reduced the whole-cell currents. The whole-cell current of GIRK channels with a constitutively active gate, GIRK 2 (V 188 A), [Yi, B. A., Lin, Y. F., Jan, Y. N. & Jan, L. Y. (2001) Neuron 29, 657 – 667] was also reduced by the same glutamate mutation. Mean open time and conductance of single channels in GIRK 2 and IRK 2 were not affected by the mutation, indicating that the reduced whole-cell current resulted from a lowered probability of channel activation. The mutated GIRK and IRK showed normal trafficking to the cell membrane. The mutated GIRK 2 retained the ability to interact with G protein βγ subunits, and it showed almost the same inwardly rectifying property as the wild type. The mutated GIRK 1 and GIRK 2 retained ion selectivity to K+ ions. This glutamate residue corresponds to one of the residues causing Andersen's syndrome [Plaster, N. M., Tawil, R., Tristani-Firouzi, M., Canun, S., Bendahhou, S., Tsunoda, A., Donaldson, M. R., Iannaccone, S. T., Brunt, E., Barohn, R., et al. (2001) Cell 105, 511 – 519]. Our interpretation is that this region of the glutamate residue is crucial in relaying the activating message from the ligand sensor region to the gate...|$|E

40|$|The field {{equations}} and {{boundary conditions}} of Horava-Witten theory, compactified on a smooth compact spin quotient of CH^ 3, where CH^ 3 denotes the hyperbolic cousin of CP^ 3, are {{studied in the}} presence of Casimir energy density terms. If the Casimir energy densities near one boundary result in a certain constant of integration taking a value greater than around 10 ^ 5 in units of the d = 11 gravitational length, a form of thick pipe geometry is found that realizes TeV-scale gravity by the ADD mechanism, with that boundary becoming the inner surface of the thick pipe, where we live. Three alternative ways in which the outer surface of the thick pipe might be stabilized consistent with the observed value of the effective d = 4 cosmological constant are considered. In the first alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in the classical region and the constant of integration is fixed at around 10 ^{ 13 } in units of the d = 11 gravitational length for consistency with the observed cosmological constant. In the second alternative, the four observed dimensions have reduced in size down to the d = 11 gravitational length at the outer surface, and there are Casimir effects near the outer surface. In the third alternative, the outer surface is stabilized in the classical region by extra fluxes of the three-form gauge field, whose four-form field strength wraps three-cycles of the compact six-manifold times the radial dimension of the thick pipe.

40|$|Data from {{epidemiological}} {{studies have demonstrated}} that genetics is an important risk factor for schizophrenia. Disturbances of serotonergic brain pathways have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Some studies have suggested that the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics on schizophrenia treatment {{may be related to the}} serotonin 2 A receptor (5 -HT 2 A), and that serotonergic drugs may induce psychotic symptoms. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between the C 516 T polymorphism and schizophrenia in a Brazilian population composed by 246 patients and 315 healthy matched controls in a case-control approach. No statistically differences were observed in allelic (chi 2 = 1. 77, 1 d. f., p= 0. 18) or genotypic (chi 2 = 1. 69, 2 d. f., p= 0. 42) distributions between cases and controls. The results suggest that the C 516 T polymorphism of the 5 -HT 2 A receptor gene is not related to the susceptibility for schizophrenia in our Brazilian sample. Estudos epidemiológicos têm demonstrado que o componente genético é importante fator de risco para o desenvolvimento de esquizofrenia. Alterações nas vias cerebrais serotonérgicas têm sido relacionadas à fisiopatologia da esquizofrenia. Algumas investigações têm sugerido que a eficácia de antipsicóticos atípicos no tratamento da esquizofrenia pode estar relacionada com sua ação no receptor de serotonina subtipo 2 A (5 -HT 2 A), e que drogas serotonérgicas podem provocar sintomas psicóticos. Assim, o objetivo desta investigação foi examinar a associação entre o polimorfismo C 516 T do gene do receptor 5 -HT 2 A e esquizofrenia em uma amostra brasileira composta por 246 pacientes <b>e</b> <b>315</b> controles saudáveis e pareados em um estudo tipo caso-controle.
