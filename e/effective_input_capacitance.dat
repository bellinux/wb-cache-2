40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} non-contact bio-potential sensor which can quickly respond to input transient events, is insensitive to mechanical disturbances, and operates with a bandwidth from 0. 04 Hz – 20 kHz, with input voltage noise spectral density of 200 nV / √Hz at 1 kHz. Initial investigations {{focused on the}} development of an active biasing scheme to control the sensors input impedance in response to input transient events. This scheme was found to significantly reduce the settling time of the sensor; however the input impedance was degraded, and the device was sensitive to distance fluctuations. Further research was undertaken, and a circuit developed to preserve fast settling times, whilst decreasing the sensitivity to distance fluctuations. A novel amplifier biasing network was developed using a pair of junction field effect transistors (JFETs), which actively compensates for DC and low frequency interference, whilst maintaining high impedance at signal frequencies. This biasing network significantly reduces the settling time, allowing bio-potentials to be measured quickly after sensor application, and speeding up recovery when the sensor is in saturation. Further work focused on reducing the sensitivity to mechanical disturbances even further. A positive feedback path with low phase error was introduced to reduce the <b>effective</b> <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the sensor. Tuning of the positive feedback loop gain was achieved with coarse and fine control potentiometers, allowing very precise gains to be achieved. The sensor was found to be insensitive to distance fluctuations of up to 0. 5 mm at 1 Hz, and up to 2 mm at 5 kHz. As a complement to the non-contact sensor, an amplifier to measure differential bio-potentials was developed. This differential amplifier achieved a CMRR of greater than 100 dB up to 10 kHz. Precise fixed gains of 20 ± 0 : 02 dB, 40 ± 0 : 01 dB, 60 ± 0 : 03 dB, and 80 ± 0 : 3 dB were achieved, with input voltage noise density of 15 nV / √Hz at 1 kHz...|$|E

40|$|Transimpedance {{amplifiers}} using {{voltage feedback}} operational amplifiers {{are widely used}} for current to voltage conversion in applications when a moderate/high bandwidth and a high sensitivity are required, such as photodiodes, photomultipliers, electron multipliers and capacitive sensors. The conventional circuit presents a virtual earth to the input and at low frequencies, the <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> is usually not a significant concern. However, at high frequencies and especially for high sensitivity circuits, the total <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> can severely limit the available bandwidth from the circuit. The <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> in effect constitutes part of the feedback network of the op-amp and hence reduces the available loop gain at high frequencies. In some cases a high <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> can cause the circuit to have a lightly damped or unstable dynamic response. Lag compensation by simply adding feedback capacitance is generally used to guarantee stability, however this approach does not permit the full gain-bandwidth characteristic of the op-amp to be fully exploited. Active techniques for reducing the <b>input</b> <b>capacitance,</b> for instance bootstrapping, have been previously reported and over {{the last ten years}} several papers have described successful examples of transimpedance circuits using bootstrapping. The basic bootstrapping principle is to use an additional buffer amplifier to actively charge and discharge to <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> as required.

This paper presents a brief overview of the technique and introduces {{for the first time the}} four possible bootstrap configurations (series or shunt bootstrapping loops, with either floating or grounded sources) applied to the basic transimpedance circuit.

40|$|Flash Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), {{targeting}} {{optical communication}} standards, {{have been reported}} in SiGe BiCMOS technology. CMOS implementation of such designs faces two challenges. The first is to achieve a high sampling speed, given the lower gain-bandwidth (lower ft) of CMOS technology. The second challenge is to handle the wide bandwidth of the input signal with a certain accuracy. Although the first problem can be relaxed by using the time-interleaved architecture, the second problem remains as a main obstacle to CMOS implementation. As a result, the feasibility of the CMOS implementation of ADCs for such applications, or other wide band applications, depends primarily on achieving a very small <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> (large bandwidth) at the desired accuracy. In the flash architecture, the <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> is traded off for the achievable accuracy. This tradeoff becomes tighter with technology scaling. An effective way to ease this tradeoff is to use resistive offset averaging. This permits the use of smaller area transistors, leading to a reduction in the ADC <b>input</b> <b>capacitance.</b> In addition, interpolation can be used to decrease the <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> of flash ADCs. In an interpolating architecture, the number of ADC input preamplifiers is reduced significantly, and a resistor network interpolates the missing zero-crossings needed for an N-bit conversion. The resistive network also averages out the preamplifiers offsets. Consequently, an interpolating network works also as an averaging network. The resistor network used for averaging or interpolation causes a systematic non-linearity at the ADC transfer characteristics edges. The common solution to this problem is to extend the preamplifiers array beyond the input signal voltage range by using dummy preamplifiers. However, this demands a corresponding extension of the flash ADC reference-voltage resistor ladder. Since the voltage headroom of the reference ladder {{is considered to be a}} main bottleneck in the implementation of flash ADCs in deep-submicron technologies with reduced supply voltage, extending the reference voltage beyond the input voltage range is highly undesirable. The principal objective of this thesis is to develop a new circuit technique to enhance the bandwidth-accuracy product of flash ADCs. Thus, first, a rigorous analysis of flash ADC architectures accuracy-bandwidth tradeoff is presented. It is demonstrated that the interpolating architecture achieves a superior accuracy compared to that of a full flash architecture for the same <b>input</b> <b>capacitance,</b> and hence would lead to a higher bandwidth-accuracy product, especially in deep-submicron technologies that use low power supplies. Also, the gain obtained, when interpolation is employed, is quantified. In addition, the limitations of a previous claim, which suggests that an interpolating architecture is equivalent to an averaging full flash architecture that trades off accuracy for the <b>input</b> <b>capacitance,</b> is presented. Secondly, a termination technique for the averaging/interpolation network of flash ADC preamplifiers is devised. The proposed technique maintains the linearity of the ADC at the transfer characteristics edges and cancels out the over-range voltage, consumed by the dummy preamplifiers. This makes flash ADCs more amenable for integration in deep-submicron CMOS technologies. In addition, the elimination of this over-range voltage allows a larger least-significant bit. As a result, a higher input referred offset is tolerated, and a significant reductions in the ADC <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> and power dissipation are achieved at the same accuracy. Unlike a previous solution, the proposed technique does not introduce negative transconductance at flash ADC preamplifiers array edges. As a result, the offset averaging technique can be used efficiently. To prove the resulting saving in the ADC <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> and power dissipation that is attained by the proposed termination technique, a 6 -bit 1. 6 -GS/s flash ADC test chip is designed and implemented in 0. 13 -μm CMOS technology.
