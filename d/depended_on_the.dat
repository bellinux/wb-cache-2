5|$|The two-sector system {{approach}} models {{the economy}} as two separate systems: one involving the standard macroeconomic variables, while the other includes gender-specific variables. William Darity developed a two-sector approach for low-income, farm-based economies. Darity shows that subsistence farming <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> labor of women, while the production of income <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> labor of {{both men and women}} in cash-crop activities. This model shows that when men control production and income, they seek to maximize income by persuading women to put additional effort into cash-crop production, causing increases in cash crops {{come at the expense of}} subsistence production.|$|E
5|$|A {{major step}} forward {{in the study of}} {{bacteria}} came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognised that archaea have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria. This new phylogenetic taxonomy <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA, and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the three-domain system.|$|E
5|$|Capitalization {{during this}} time was not standardized. It <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> authors and their background.

It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible.

5|$|The Somerset towns {{charter of}} {{incorporation}} was received in 1705. Growth {{in the trade}} and economy largely <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drainage of the surrounding moors.

30|$|The {{pressure}} drop calculations <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{properties of the}} mixture of liquid including oil and water in addition to the gas. The total {{pressure drop}} is equal to the summation of the hydrostatic, friction, and acceleration pressure drops. <b>The</b> hydrostatic term <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mixture density, which {{is a function of the}} liquid holdup. <b>The</b> friction term <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> friction factor for the mixture. The acceleration term appears due to the change in velocity resulting from the change in pressure. <b>The</b> friction calculations <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> flow regime, which in turn <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> superficial velocity of liquid and gas phases.|$|R

5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be {{sensitive}} primarily in a single direction, {{the length of the}} blips <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> position of the target relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see {{directly in front of the}} fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one on either side of the centreline.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{maintaining}} the canal for its amenity value began before the canal closed, with the Inland Waterways Association mounting a campaign to retain it when plans to close it were first announced in 1952. They were already formulating plans for {{the revival of the}} Thames and Severn Canal, which <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Stroudwater for its link to the River Severn. The National Parks Commission declared that it should be retained for its amenity value and beauty in 1954, but it was closed nevertheless.|$|E
5|$|Once a field {{had been}} selected, an observing {{strategy}} {{had to be}} developed. An important decision was to determine which filters the observations would use; WFPC2 is equipped with forty-eight filters, including narrowband filters isolating particular emission lines of astrophysical interest, and broadband filters useful {{for the study of}} the colours of stars and galaxies. The choice of filters to be used for the HDF <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 'throughput' of each filter—the total proportion of light that it allows through—and the spectral coverage available. Filters with bandpasses overlapping as little as possible were desirable.|$|E

However, {{the accuracy of the}} measurements <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> uniformity of the magnetic field, and Ramsey found that it was difficult to create sufficiently uniform magnetic fields. He developed the separated oscillatory field method in 1949 as a means of achieving the accuracy he wanted.|$|E
5|$|Seven offered Johns the 10.30pm Thursday timeslot, which Johns had {{the option}} of declining owing to a clause in his contract. Co-host Webcke was not happy with the late time, and Johns' {{producers}} perceived that there may be difficulty in booking guests at that time. Consequently, Johns declined the offer and sat out 2011 on full pay. It has also been suggested that success of The Matty Johns Show <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> success of related AFL show The Bounce, which failed in 2010.

5|$|The colonial {{government}} in the Congo depended on its military to maintain civil order and, above all, it <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> loyalty of the native troops who made {{up the bulk of}} the Force Publique. Black non-commissioned Officers led by First Sergeant-Major Ngoie Mukalabushi, a veteran of the East Africa Campaign, munitied at Luluabourg in the central Congolese province of Kasaï in February 1944; the trigger for this was a plan to vaccinate troops who had served at the front, though the soldiers were also unhappy about the demands placed on them and their treatment by their white officers.|$|E
