5|$|Juneteenth, {{which is}} the oldest nationally celebrated {{commemoration}} of the ending of slavery in the United States, owes its origins to {{the announcement of the}} Emancipation Proclamation upon the return of Union forces to Galveston in 1865. Galveston was the first city in Texas to provide a secondary school and public library <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|E
5|$|When King was a child, he befriended a {{white boy}} whose father owned a {{business}} near his family's home. When {{the boys were}} six, they started school: King had to attend a school <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and the other boy went to one for whites (public schools were among the facilities segregated by state law). King lost his friend because the child's father no longer wanted the boys to play together.|$|E
5|$|Black Enterprise {{magazine}} {{found that}} Cosby {{was one of}} only a very few African Americans who could command among the highest fees paid for advertising spokespeople. The 1981 feature also highlighted how rare it was <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> to be hired for a complete campaign, as opposed to a single advertisement, despite an overall increase in opportunities. Cosby's agents told the magazine he had earned at least $3 million in current advertising contractsabout one-fifth of his incomethe rest of which he earned from live performances.|$|E
50|$|The {{mortality}} rates <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males are also typically {{higher than they}} are <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> females. Between 1980 and 2003, 4,744 to 27,141 more <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males died annually than <b>African</b> <b>American</b> females. This higher incarceration rate and mortality rate helps to explain the low marriage rates <b>for</b> many <b>African</b> <b>American</b> females who cannot find black mates.|$|R

5|$|Hispanic Americans, also {{referred}} to as Latinos, served in all elements of the American armed forces in the war. They fought in every major American battle in the war. Between 250,000 and 500,000 Hispanic Americans served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II, {{out of a total of}} 12,000,000, constituting 2.3% to 4.7% of the U.S. Armed Forces. The exact number is unknown as, at the time, Hispanics were not tabulated separately, but were generally included in the general white population census count. Separate statistics were kept <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and Asian Americans.|$|E
5|$|One notable {{section of}} Riverside is Silvertown, a {{subdivision}} developed in 1887 <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> Initially isolated from largely white Riverside to the east, it was eventually {{absorbed into the}} growing neighborhood. As such, Silvertown residents became some of the few black plantation house owners in Riverside through the period of segregation. A few one-story wood-frame houses in the area may date to the original development, including one pantation house owned by a woman and then her daughter from 1887 into the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Tennessee {{after his}} presidency, Johnson sought {{political}} vindication, and gained {{it in his}} eyes {{when he was elected}} to the Senate again in 1875, making Johnson the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died just months into his term. While some admire Johnson's strict constitutionalism, his strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> is widely criticized. He is regarded by many historians as one of the worst presidents in American history.|$|E

40|$|<b>African</b> <b>American</b> males face major {{challenges}} in retention and graduation from {{institutions of higher}} education. The 6 -year graduation rate <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males at 4 -year public institutions and private nonprofit colleges is less than 40 %. This figure suggests that persistence toward degree attainment is a problem. The {{purpose of this study}} was to ascertain whether selected precollege- and college-level variables have a relationship to retention and graduation <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males. Gateway University, a historically black college and university, was the site of the investigation. Three research questions were posed: (a) What precollege variables best predict retention and graduation <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males? (b) What college-level vari-ables best predict retention and graduation <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males? and (c) What combination of precollege- and college-level variables best predict reten-tion and graduation <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males? Five-hundred and sixty-two <b>African</b> <b>American</b> males, entering freshmen for the 2005 â€“ 2006 academic year, comprised the sample. Inferential analyses, including bivariate relationships, cross-tabulations, chi-square and logistic regression, were performed to determine relationships betwee...|$|R

5|$|The Civil Rights Movement gained congressional {{passage of}} the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965, {{eventually}} ending legal segregation and regaining effective suffrage <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> But whites in the state {{had more than one}} way to reduce African Americans' voting power. Maintaining the city commission form of government with at-large voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority, as African Americans could not command a majority for their candidates in the informally segregated city.|$|E
5|$|The Nashville Christian Leadership Council (or NCLC), {{was founded}} by the Reverend Kelly Miller Smith, pastor of First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill. This {{organization}} was an affiliate of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Southern Christian Leadership Conference and was established to promote civil rights <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> through nonviolent civil disobedience. Smith believed that White Americans would be more sympathetic to desegregation if African Americans obtained their rights through peaceful demonstration rather than through the judicial system or violent confrontation.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistrust of}} Standard Oil was {{partially}} {{the result of}} a suspicion toward carpetbaggers, which ironically was also the source of skepticism regarding labor unions. Union organizers were frequently seen as attempting to support a Northern agenda of promoting opportunities <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> {{at the expense of the}} white population. Because of the situation this created, labor reform was slow to develop. Despite the anti-union sentiments, groups like the International Oil Workers Union attracted membership and held some influence in the industry and state government.|$|E

5|$|While {{the civil}} rights {{movement}} fought against racial segregation, MalcolmX advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> in the southern or southwestern United States as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa. MalcolmX suggested the United States government owed reparations to black people for the unpaid labor of their ancestors. He also rejected {{the civil rights}} movement's strategy of nonviolence, advocating instead that black people should defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|A Republican, Harrison {{was elected}} to the {{presidency}} in 1888, defeating the Democratic incumbent, Grover Cleveland. Hallmarks of Harrison's administration included unprecedented economic legislation, including the McKinley Tariff, which imposed historic protective trade rates, and the Sherman Antitrust Act. Harrison also facilitated the creation of the national forest reserves through an amendment to the Land Revision Act of 1891. During his administration six western states were admitted to the Union. In addition, Harrison substantially strengthened and modernized the U.S. Navy and conducted an active foreign policy, but his proposals to secure federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> were unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Henry Martin Tupper D.D. (April 11, 1831 â€“ November 12, 1893) was a Baptist {{minister}} who founded Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. Beginning with bible and literacy classes in December 1865, {{it was the}} first university established <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> following {{the end of the civil}} war, and the oldest historically black college and university (HBCU) in the Southern United States, as well as one of the oldest co-educational universities in the country. When the institute moved into a new building in 1871, it was renamed as Shaw Collegiate Institute in honor of a major donor. Tupper served as the University's first president from its founding until his death in 1893.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, three {{civil rights}} workers (two white and one black) who {{organize}} a voter registry <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> in Jessup County, Mississippi go missing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation sends two agents, Rupert Andersonâ€”a former Mississippi sheriffâ€”and Alan Ward, to investigate. The pair {{find it difficult}} to conduct interviews with the local townspeople, as Sheriff Ray Stuckey and his deputies exert influence over the public and are linked to a branch of the Ku Klux Klan. The wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell reveals to Anderson in a discreet conversation that the three missing men have been murdered. Their bodies are later found buried in an earthen dam. Stuckey deduces Mrs Pell's confession to the FBI and informs Pell, who brutally beats his wife in retribution.|$|E

5|$|Peres {{was fired}} in 1860 because he opened a store that {{conducted}} business on Saturdays, the Jewish Sabbath. He was replaced by Simon Tuska, who moved the congregation from Orthodox to Reform practices. Tuska died in 1871, and was succeeded by Max Samfield; under his leadership, the synagogue {{was one of the}} founding members of the Union for Reform Judaism. In 1884, Children of Israel completed a new building, and membership grew rapidly. Samfield died in 1915, and was succeeded by Bill Fineshriber, an outspoken supporter of women's suffrage and equal rights <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> The following year the congregation moved to a new building, where membership continued to grow. Fineshriber left in 1924, and was succeeded by Harry Ettelson.|$|E
5|$|The later 19th {{century was}} a high point {{in the history of}} civil rights <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> Reconstruction for a time limited the power of former slaveholders in Texas. Leaders, such as George T. Ruby and Norris Wright Cuney, worked to {{establish}} educational and employment opportunities for blacks and organize black voters to support the Republican Party, then the main party supporting black rights in the South. Cuney's efforts led to higher employment and higher wages for blacks in the city, especially on the wharves, and eventually led to combined black and white trade unions during the 1890s and early 1900s. Cuney himself rose to the chairmanship of the Texas Republican Party, the most powerful position held by any black American in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Du Bois {{opposed the}} U.S. {{intervention}} in World War II, {{particularly in the}} Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan <b>for</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of the force, and {{there were to be}} no African-American combat unitsâ€“ virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.The military later changed its policy, and units such as the Tuskegee Airmen saw combat. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.|$|E
