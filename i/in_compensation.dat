40|$|AbstractWe analyze 228 {{executive}} compensation contracts voluntarily disclosed by Chinese listed firms {{and find that}} central-government-controlled companies disclose more information <b>in</b> executive <b>compensation</b> contracts than local-government-controlled and non-government-controlled companies. Cash-based payments are the main form of {{executive compensation}}, whereas equity-based payments are seldom used by Chinese listed companies. On average, there are {{no significant differences in}} the value of basic salaries and performance-based <b>compensation</b> <b>in</b> executive <b>compensation</b> contracts. But, compared with their counterparts in non-government-controlled companies, executives in government-controlled companies are given more incentive compensation. Accounting earnings are typically used <b>in</b> executive <b>compensation</b> contracts, with few firms using stock returns to evaluate their executives.

5|$|The Astros {{have made}} 12 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft. They have made the first overall selection in the draft five times; in 1976, 1992, 2012, 2013, and 2014. They have had 16 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Astros have failed to sign three of their first-round picks. First, pitcher Randy Scarbery (1970) did not sign though the Astros received no pick <b>in</b> <b>compensation.</b> John Burke (1991) and Brady Aiken (2014) also did not sign. The Astros were given the 37th pick of the 1992 draft and a pick in the 2015 draft <b>in</b> <b>compensation.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2008, sports channel ESPN won {{the right}} to {{broadcast}} Bowl Championship Series games between 2011 and 2014. <b>In</b> <b>compensation,</b> it agreed to pay the BCS $125million per year, more than a competing bid from Fox ($100million), which had been paying $82.5million per year for the contract that ended in 2010. To balance the higher cost of broadcasting the games, ESPN demanded more money for title sponsorship of each game. Shipping company FedEx, which had become the Orange Bowl's title sponsor in 1990 and was the longest continuous sponsor of any bowl game, balked at ESPN's increased demands—about $20million per year and required advertising outside the Orange Bowl—and ended its sponsorship.|$|E
