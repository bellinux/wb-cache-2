Undoubtedly an interesting area, which is also the subject of this thesis, is the centralized procurement. Regarding the fact that this institution is not very widespread in the Czech Republic, I have joined the description of a central public procurement in selected European countries to this chapter. The conclusion of this thesis is devoted to a brief outline of the current amendment to Act No. 137 / 2006 Coll., on Public Contracts, as amended, which is currently {{at the beginning of the}} legislative process. In this final chapter, I have also joined some of my thoughts to the legal aspects in relation to the <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> <b>of</b> public <b>contract.</b> Personally, I believe that the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Resumé Problems {{associated}} with awarding of public procurement by sector <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> The topic <b>of</b> this Dissertation is presentation of certain problems {{associated with}} awarding of public procurement by sector <b>contracting</b> <b>entities.</b> To begin with, basic issues of tenders and public procurement procedures are presented in a legal framework, referring {{not only to the}} Laws of the Czech Republic but also to the Laws of the European Union. This part includes definitions of basic terms, especially the public procurement concept and principles of applicable legislation. A short historical context concerning development of the legal norm after 1989 is provided. In the actual text, appropriate attention is paid to differentiation <b>of</b> public <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> with an emphasis on the content and development of the term "sector contracting entity". The definition <b>of</b> sector <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> is a key term of this Dissertation. The process of awarding of public procurement by a sector <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> is subject to numerous legal exemptions, as well as some specific law regulations. These exemptions and law regulations are described and thoroughly analysed in the Dissertation. In relevant cases, a comparison between the existing laws and legislation amendments enacted as of April 1, 2012 is made, completed [...] ...|$|R

Ever year, more than eight thousand tenders are announced in the Czech Republic. There are more than fifteen thousand contracting authorities. The public sector expends more than 600 billion Czech crowns on public procurement every year. The acting of subjects involved in the procurement proces is often unlawful. It is therefore necessary to set the legal framework of competition for public contracts {{so that it will}} be ensured prevention the unlawful procedures of subjects affecting the procurement process and ensure the most efficient spending of public funds. This thesis consists of four chapters. The first concerns the most important principles associated with public procurement. There are also <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> practical reflection of these principles to various statutory provisions. The second chapter is devoted to the juridical institut of objections to acts <b>of</b> the <b>contracting</b> authorities.

40|$|Through the {{institute}} of public procurement a considerable volume of financial resources is allocated. It is therefore in the interest <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> to seek ways of how to achieve an efficient allocation of resources. Some public contract-awarding entities, along with some public-administration authorities in the Czech Republic, believe {{that the use of}} a single evaluation criterion (the lowest bid price) results in a more efficient tender for a public contract. It was found that <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> in the Czech Republic strongly prefer to use the lowest bid price criterion. Within the examined sample, 86. 5 % of public procurements were evaluated this way. The analysis of the examined sample <b>of</b> public <b>contracts</b> proved that the choice of an evaluation criterion, even the preference of the lowest bid price criterion, does not have any obvious impact on the final cost <b>of</b> a public <b>contract.</b> The study concludes that it is inappropriate to prefer the criterion of the lowest bid price within the evaluation <b>of</b> public <b>contracts</b> that are characterised by their complexity (including public contracts for construction works and public service <b>contracts).</b> The findings <b>of</b> the Supreme Audit Office related to the inspection <b>of</b> public <b>contracts</b> indicate that when using the lowest bid price as an evaluation criterion, a public contract may indeed be tendered with the lowest bid price, but not necessarily the best offer in terms of supplied quality. It is therefore not appropriate to use the lowest bid price evaluation criterion to such an extent for the purpose of evaluating work and services. Any improvement to this situation requires a corresponding amendment to the Law on Public Contracts and mainly a radical change in the attitude of the Office for the Protection of Competition towards proposed changes, as indicated within the conclusions and recommendations proposed by this study...|$|R

After explaining how non-state sources of trust and private recourse evolve to enhance credibility, <b>examples</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> around undesirable rules in United States are discussed. The potential for contractual nullification varies considerably, however, in part because of state action that limits civil-society and/or market activities. In many less robust economies, there are even more significant barriers to building private sources of trust and recourse, undermining the potential for contractual nullification...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} typical {{decisions}} made by <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> which restrict the competition among economic operators. The thesis analyses the typical mistakes which are made by the <b>contract</b> <b>entities</b> in awarding procedures. The causes of mistakes being made by <b>contracting</b> <b>entities</b> can be summarized into three groups. Into the first group belong conscious mistakes. For these mistakes shall be contracting entities` agents held responsible. Into the second group belong mistakes in planning. Mistakes from the third group are made {{as a consequence of}} lack of professional skills. None of these mistakes can be prevented just by an amendment to the Act on Public <b>Contracts.</b> Any proposal <b>of</b> an amendment solving the lack of professional skills shall consider also all connected negative effects; mainly additional time demands, financial costs and the risk of underfinanced praxis turning into formalism. Professionally skilled agents are usually more careful when they apply the Act on Public Contracts because they are aware of legal risks. Considering current limited budget resources it should be decided whether to put stress on cooperation with internal or external experts. The author recommends internal experts because external experts do not do their best if they are aware of the fact being not controlled effectively by internal experts. However the current Act on Public Contracts is not perfect, the duties laid by it are enforced successfully. Considering a new amendment also the legal theory shall be taken into account. The author presumes similarity of preventing of breaches against the Act on Public <b>Contracts</b> and <b>of</b> preventing of crimes. The most important factor preventing from criminality is to be aware that the punishment is inescapable, not its rates. The author points out also the opinion of the general theory of law according to which a new act is to be passed only if there is an objective necessary need. It should not to be passed by a fortuity or because of subjective views. There should be also a time space between the amendments. There was an amendment to Act on Public Contracts approved in 2010 and European Union currently prepares amending of awarding directives. The author therefore prefers improving the praxis of awarding in the Czech Republic by granting additional human resources to the Office for the Protection of Competition to passing of another amendment to the Act on Public <b>Contracts.</b> The scope <b>of</b> the Act on Public Contracts is also not convenient for amending a list <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> clauses which are not allowed to be concluded by <b>contracting</b> <b>entities.</b> There are two reasons. <b>Contracting</b> <b>entities</b> are constituted by various groups <b>of</b> subjects and <b>contracts</b> selling their property are outside the scope of the Act on Public <b>Contracts.</b> <b>Contracting</b> <b>entities</b> should use standard awarding procedure to promote competition among economic operators. They should concentrate on exactness of tender conditions. A good prevention to mistakes in awarding procedure is also good planning and skilled human recourses <b>of</b> <b>contracting</b> <b>entities...</b>|$|R

This paper studies this choice and imposes an implementation cost on the <b>contracting</b> <b>entity</b> to motivate such a restriction.

40|$|An {{electronic}} contracting system {{intended for}} monitoring and/or enforcement of business-to-business interactions {{to ensure that}} they comply with the rights, obligations and prohibitions stipulated in contract clauses requires a machine interpretable specification of the relevant parts <b>of</b> the legal <b>contract</b> in force. Within this context, Event Condition Action (ECA) rules are widely used for representing contracts. Naturally, it is important to verify the correctness properties <b>of</b> such a <b>contract</b> before its deployment. To this end, the paper adopts the use of model-checking techniques. A high-level model [...] checking tool has been developed that enables a designer to encode a contract for model checking directly as ECA rules in terms <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> entities: business operations, role players with their rights, obligations and prohibitions. This not only simplifies the task of model building but also, the designer can specify the correctness requirements, in linear temporal logic, directly in terms <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> <b>entities.</b> The tool has been implemented by extendin...|$|R
