5|$|One {{of the men}} {{helps the}} girl up, she spreads her wings and gives them a {{grateful}} smile; he kisses <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> the other winks in farewell. Soon, she is gone drifting upward into the sky. Briefly, a major urban cityscape is seen beyond the trees. From a bird's-eye view, we see {{the shape of the}} car veering off the road and slowing to a stop in the grass.|$|E
5|$|Five {{weeks after}} Homer made his pledge to behave, Marge realizes {{that she is}} bored by all the sudden peace and quiet. The {{demolition}} derby form flies into <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> she decides {{to give it a}} try. When she leaves, Homer wakes up and finds Marge is gone and so is the demolition derby form, so he heads off to the derby with the kids to stop her. Although Marge initially enjoys the demolition derby, things soon get too dangerous for her. Homer has no idea how to save her, as he has given up being reckless. Bart comes up with an idea and calls for a beer can from a vendor. Homer then drinks the beer and rescues Marge (in a style similar to Popeye), who makes him promise not to make her the live wire in the family.|$|E
60|$|Now she sat {{herself down}} in a chair, {{covering}} her face with <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>and</b> I saw from the trembling of her body that she was sobbing. While I wondered what to do, for the sight wrung me, she let fall <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> there were tears upon her face.|$|R

5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She raises <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, with her head displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E
5|$|A chapter {{entitled}} Shashthidevyupakhyanam, appended to {{the texts}} Brahma Vaivarta Purana and Devi Bhagavata Purana, narrates {{the tale of}} Shashthi. King Priyavrata – the son of Svayambhuva Manu (the progenitor of mankind) – and his wife Malini performed the putrakamesti yajna (a fire-sacrifice ritual to gain a son) {{in an effort to}} conceive, but after twelve years of pregnancy, a still-born son was delivered to Malini. Priyavrata set off to the cremation grounds with the corpse of his son. On his way, he saw a celestial woman dressed in white silk and jewels, riding in a heavenly chariot. She declared to Priyavrata that she was Devasena, the daughter of Brahma and wife of Skanda. She further said that she was Shashthi, foremost of the Matrikas ("Mothers") of Skanda, and had the power to grant children to devotees. She held the child in <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> resurrected the infant, then began to leave for her heavenly abode, taking the child with her. Priyavrata stopped the goddess, praising her and pleading that she return his son to him. The goddess agreed on the condition that Priyavrata would initiate and propagate her worship in all three worlds: heaven, earth and the netherworld. She returned the child to the king, naming him Suvrata and declaring that he should become famous as a great, virtuous, and learned ruler. Priyavrata decreed that Shashthi should be worshipped on the sixth day of every month, as well as the sixth and twenty-first days after childbirth, and on all occasions auspicious to a child. She would be worshipped {{in the form of a}} Shaligrama stone, a Purna Ghata under a banyan tree, or an image of her on a wall.|$|E

5|$|During the 2015 season, Fishlock scored {{her first}} {{goal of the}} season during the team's home-opener against Western New York Flash. Her goal in the 25th minute {{was the first of}} the match and assist to Megan Rapinoe in the 86th minute contributed to a 5–1 win for the Reign. During a match against the Washington Spirit on 2 May, Fishlock scored a goal in the 75th minute off an assist from Kim Little {{resulting}} in a 3–1 win over the Spirit. During a match against Sky Blue FC in New Jersey, Fishlock received a controversial red card in the 90th minute that required her to sit out the team's next match against league-leading Chicago Red Stars. The controversy stemmed from a scrum in the box after a Sky Blue corner kick and Fishlock's last-minute save on the goal line. Fishlock stated the ball bounced off her head, but Sky Blue forward Nadia Nadim said she blocked it with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> the ref awarded Sky Blue the penalty kick. Both matches resulted in 1–1 draws. During the team's second match against Sky Blue FC in Seattle on 6 June, Fishlock scored a goal and an assist earning Player of the Match after leading Seattle to a 3–0 win. She was named NWSL Player of the Week by the media for the ninth week of the season. The Reign finished the regular season in first place clinching the NWSL Shield for the second consecutive time. After advancing to the playoffs, Seattle faced fourth-place team Washington Spirit and won 3–0, advancing to the championship final. Seattle was ultimately defeated 1–0 by FC Kansas City during the championship final in Portland. Fishlock, along with teammates Kim Little, Beverly Yanez, and Lauren Barnes were named to the NWSL Best XI team.|$|E
5|$|The Pranotasani Tantra narrates {{that once}} Parvati longed {{to go back}} to her {{maternal}} house for some days and asked Shiva's permission to do so. The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days, he would come to fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya's place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller, when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance and took <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> kissed her. Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her) might last forever as Ucchishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.|$|E

25|$|Bishop Gauthey of Nevers and the Church exhumed {{the body}} of Bernadette Soubirous on 22 September 1909, in the {{presence}} of representatives appointed by the postulators of the cause, two doctors and a sister of the community. They claimed that although the crucifix in <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> her rosary had both oxidized, her body appeared incorrupt— preserved from decomposition. This was cited as one of the miracles to support her canonization. They washed and reclothed her body before burial in a new double casket.|$|E
25|$|Tobey takes <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> {{places it}} over his erection.

The umpire did not see Henin raise <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> thus did not allow Williams a first serve. Williams lost the game and would go on to lose the match. Their last match took place in the final of the 2010 Australian Open where Williams won in three sets, earning her 12th Grand Slam title.|$|E
25|$|On 20 December 2016, Kvitová was {{attacked}} and robbed {{at her apartment}} in Prostějov, Czech Republic, suffering multiple lacerations to the tendons and nerves on her left hand and fingers while trying to defend herself. The knife-wielding attacker left with $192 worth of cash and is suspected to be a male in his mid-thirties. She successfully underwent surgery {{to repair the damage}} to <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>and</b> was expected to sit out the next six months in order to fully recover.
