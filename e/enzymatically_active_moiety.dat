40|$|AbstractRicin and Shiga toxin {{belong to}} a group of protein toxins with targets in the cytosol. These toxins consist of one moiety that binds the toxin {{molecule}} to cell surface receptors, and another <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> <b>moiety</b> that enters the cytosol after endocytic uptake of the toxin. The toxins are of current interest in relation to disease and the construction of immunotoxins. Moreover, they have proven useful to investigate mechanisms of endocytosis and to follow intracellular pathways of transport. Some of the recent results obtained with ricin and Shiga toxin are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Shiga toxin binds to globotriaosylceramide (Gb 3) recep-tors on {{the target}} cell surface. To enter the cytosol, Shiga toxin is {{dependent}} on endocytic uptake, retrograde trans-port to the Golgi apparatus and further to the endoplas-mic reticulum before translocation of the <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> <b>moiety</b> to the cytosol. Here, we have investigated the importance of newly synthesized glycosphingolipids for the uptake and intracellular transport of Shiga toxin in HEp- 2 cells. Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis by treatment with either PDMP or Fumonisin B 1 for 24 – 48 h strongly reduced the transport of Gb 3 -bound Shiga toxin from endosomes to the Golgi apparatus. This was associ-ated with a change in localization of sorting nexins 1 and 2, and accompanied by a protection against the toxin. In contrast, there was no effect on transport or toxicity o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Endocytosed Shiga toxin is transported {{from the}} Golgi complex to the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum in butyric acid-treated A 431 ceils. We here examine {{the extent of}} this retrograde transport and its regulation. The short B fragment of Shiga toxin is sufficient for transport to the ER. The B fragment of cholera toxin, which also binds to glycolipids, is transported to all the Golgi cisterns, but cannot be localized in the ER even after butyric acid treatment. Under all conditions the toxic protein ricin was found predominantly in the trans-Golgi network. There is no transport of endocytosed fluid to the Golgi apparatus or to the ER even after butyric acid treatment and {{in the presence of}} Shiga toxin, indicating that transport to the ER, A number of protein toxins, like Shiga toxin, abrin, ricin, ~. ~ modeccin, pseudomonas toxin, and cholera toxin, •]k all consist of a moiety that binds the toxins to cell surface receptors, and an <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> <b>moiety</b> that acts on cytoplasmic targets (for review, see 42, 46, 80, 83). Several of the protein toxins are transported to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1 in the cells after endocytic uptake from the cell surface, and different lines of evidence suggest that this transport is necessary for translocation of the enzymatically active part of these toxins to the cytosol (22, 23...|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggesting}} that diphtheria toxin reaches the cytoplasm of susceptible mammalian cells by two independent mechanisms is presented. A schematic model describing the two processes of toxin {{entry into the}} cell is developed. One process of toxin uptake considered to by physiologically significant is passage of the protein toxin through the plasma membrane. This most likely happens by binding of fragment B to receptors on the membrane and by subsequent toxin-membrane interaction so that ultimately fragment A, the <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> <b>moiety,</b> is transported tothe cell interior. This process, which ultimately leads to cessation of protein synthesis and cell death, involves a comparatively small number of toxin molecules. A second mechanism of toxin uptake is by classical pinocytosis. The majority of toxin taken into the cell is accomplished by this process. The fate of toxin taken into HEp- 2 cells via pinocytosis is proteolysis by lysosomal enzymes. Thus, such vesicle-bound toxin is ordinarily not expressed biologically. Evidence {{suggesting that}} ammonium chloride provides total protection to diphtheria toxin-susceptible cells by preventing entry of toxin by the specific receptor-associated process is also provided; data showing that the ammonium salt immobilizes bound toxin on the plasma membrane of HEp- 2 cells are presented. Finally, {{it is suggested that}} actively endocytic cells such as guinea pig macrophages interact with toxin in a significantly different manner than do nonphagocytic cells...|$|E

40|$|Severe, {{invasive}} group A streptococcal infections have reemerged worldwide, and extracellular toxins, including streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB), {{have been}} implicated in pathogenesis. The genetic regulation of SpeB is not fully understood, and the mechanisms involved in the processing of the protoxin to its <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> form have not been definitively established. The present work demonstrated that the genes encoding SpeB (speB) and a peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (prsA) constitute an operon with transcription initiated from two promoters upstream of speB. Further, the speB-prsA operon was transcribed as a bicistronic mRNA. This finding {{is in contrast to}} the generally accepted notion that speB is transcribed only as a monocistronic gene. In addition, prsA has its own promoter, and transcription from this promoter starts in early log phase, prior to the transcription of speB. Genomic disruption of prsA decreased the production of <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> SpeB but not the level of the pro-SpeB zymogen.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that virus-specific particles with polycytidylate [poly(C) ]-dependent RNA polymerase activity accumulated at 30 degrees C in reovirus-infected cells. These particles sedimented heterogeneously from 300 to 550 S and traversed through a 40 % glycerol cushion to the pellet in 3 h at 190, 000 x g. In the present report, {{we found that}} smaller particles with poly(C) -dependent RNA polymerase activity remained in the glycerol cushion. These smaller, <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> particles, when purified, sedimented at 15 to 1 S. They were spherical or triangular with a diameter of 11 to 12 nm. They were comprised mostly, and likely solely, of one reovirus protein, sigma NS. No particles with poly(C) -dependent RNA polymerase activity were found in mock-infected cells. Chromatography on the cation exchanger, CM-Sephadex, ascertained that sigma NS was the poly(C) -dependent RNA polymerase and showed its existence in two forms.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} balance between trypsin and {{protease}} inhibitors simultaneously in the systemic circulation and in the thoracic lymph and peritoneal exudate. METHODS: Twenty patients with early severe acute pancreatitis were studied. <b>Enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> and immunoreactive trypsin in conjunction with its major inhibitors were measured in the 3 compartments {{at the onset of}} end-organ failure(s). The molecular forms of trypsin were determined in the lymph and ascites by gel filtration chromatography to separate trypsinogen and free-and inhibitor-bound trypsin. RESULTS: Both <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> trypsin and immunoreactive trypsin levels were highest in ascites and lymph compared with the systemic circulation. Intracompartmental alpha 1 - protease inhibitor gradient moved in the opposite direction, whereas alpha 2 macroglobulin concentration was highest in ascites and lowest in the lymph. Although most of the enzymatically and immunoreactive material in ascites and lymph consisted of trypsin complexed with alpha 2 macroglobulin and trypsinogen, respectively, free active trypsin was detected in more than 80 % of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early severe acute pancreatitis, there is a significant trypsinogen activation resulting in protease-antiprotease imbalance and thereby free <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> trypsin in the 2 body fluid compartments in close vicinity to the inflammatory process. This may be involved in the pathophysiology of local and distant tissue damage...|$|R
40|$|Catalases, {{although}} synthesized from single {{genes and}} built up from only {{one type of}} subunit, exist in heterogeneous form {{with respect to their}} conformations and association states in biological systems. This heterogeneity is not of genetic origin, but rather reflects the instability of this oligomeric heme enzyme. To understand better the factors that stabilize the various association states of catalase, we performed studies on the multimeric intermediates that are stabilized during guanidine-hydrochloride- and urea-induced unfolding of bovine liver catalase (BLC). For the first time, we have observed an <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active,</b> folded dimer of native BLC. This dimer has slightly higher enzymatic activity and altered structural properties compared to the native tetramer. Comparative studies of the effect of NaCl, GdmCl, and urea on BLC show that cation binding to negatively charged groups present in amino acid side chains of the enzyme leads to stabilization of an <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active,</b> folded dimer of BLC. Besides the folded dimer, an <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> expanded tetramer and a partially unfolded, enzymatically inactive dimer of BLC were also observed. A complete recovery of native enzyme was observed on refolding of expanded tetramers and folded dimers; however, a very low recovery (maximum of ∼ 5 %) of native enzyme was observed on refolding of partially unfolded dimers and fully unfolded monomers...|$|R

Fusion proteins were purified, and precursor and mature forms of CS were then released by proteolytic cleavage with factor Xa. Although mature CS was <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> after release, activity could be detected neither for the precursor CS nor for corresponding glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins. In contrast, two other shikimate pathway enzymes (shikimate kinase and 5 -enol-pyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase) have previously {{been shown to}} be as <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> as their respective higher molecular weight precursors. By expression of unfused, mature CS from C. sempervirens in E. coli, it was possible to obtain large quantities of <b>enzymatically</b> <b>active</b> CS protein compared to yields from plant cell cultures. Expression levels in E. coli approached 1 % of total soluble protein. No differences were found between authentic CS isolated from cell cultures and CS expressed in and purified from E. coli, which made possible a more detailed biochemical characterization of CS. Quaternary structure analysis of the purified mature CS indicated that the enzyme exists as a dimer, in contrast to the active tetrameric structures determined for E. coli and Neurospora crassa enzymes...|$|R
