50|$|After the competition, Bristol {{retained}} the Seely for general duties until 1923, {{when it was}} converted into a testbed for Jupiter development, being purchased by the Air Ministry for use with the Royal Aircraft Establishment. It was fitted with a 435 hp (324 kW) Jupiter III nine-cylinder radial engine driving a steel two-bladed Leitner-Watts propeller. The Jupiter had an <b>exhaust-driven</b> <b>supercharger</b> to enhance high-altitude performance, raising the Seely's service ceiling from 18,000 ft (5,490 m) with the Puma to 24,000 ft (8,230 m). At these altitudes, the enclosed cabin provided the observer with welcome relief from the elements.|$|E
50|$|Three Guans {{were ordered}} by the Air Ministry in 1925. As in the Gorcock, power came from {{variants}} of the Napier Lion broad arrow 12-cylinder engine. The first Guan had the 450 hp (335 kW) geared Lion IV; the second the ungeared 525 hp (475 kW) Lion VI. A projected third aircraft would have had an inverted Lion, known as the Lioness, but this machine was not built. These engines had their <b>exhaust-driven</b> <b>supercharger</b> (a concept nowadays known as turbocharger) mounted on the nose under the propeller, with much exposed pipework. The radiator was mounted under the fuselage and between the undercarriage legs. Initially these engines drove two-blade fixed-pitch airscrews, but the first aircraft was later fitted with a metal variable-pitch constant-speed propeller.|$|E
50|$|GE's {{history of}} working with {{turbines}} in the power-generation field gave them the engineering know-how {{to move into the}} new field of aircraft turbosuperchargers. Led by Sanford Alexander Moss, GE introduced the first superchargers during World War I, and continued to develop them during the Interwar period. Superchargers became indispensable in the years immediately prior to World War II, and GE was the world leader in <b>exhaust-driven</b> <b>supercharging</b> when the war started. This experience, in turn, made GE a natural selection to develop the Whittle W.1 jet engine that was demonstrated in the United States in 1941. GE ranked ninth among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. Although their early work with Whittle's designs was later handed to Allison Engine Company, GE Aviation {{emerged as one of the}} world's largest engine manufacturers, bypassing the British company, Rolls-Royce plc.|$|R
