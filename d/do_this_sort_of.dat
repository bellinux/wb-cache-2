500|$|Mr. McClure tried {{three men}} on this disagreeable task, {{but none of}} them did it very well, so a month ago it was thrust upon me. You may imagine me {{wandering}} around the country grubbing among newspaper files and court records for the next five months. It is the most laborious and sordid work I have ever come upon, and it takes every hour of my time and as much vitality as I can put into it. ... You can't know, never having done it, how such work does sap your poor brain and wring it dry of anything you'd like to pretend was there. I jump about like a squirrel in a cage and wonder how I got here and why I am doing it. I never in my life wanted to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing. I have a clean conscience on that score. Then why am I hammering away at it, I'd like to know? I often wonder whether I shall ever write another line of anything I care to.|$|E

Sinn Féin objected to the {{decision}} of Down's district council to adjourn during the man's funeral as a mark of respect. In a statement the Sinn Féin councillors said: [...] "We feel if the council is going to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing then they should do it {{for all those who}} have lost their lives due to British occupation, and not just a select few." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2014, a new zombie webisode {{series was}} announced. Digital {{producer}} Ric Forster pitched {{the idea of}} a zombie series featuring past characters in 2013. Upon learning about Screen Australia's Skip Ahead programme, which gives help with funding and resources, Forster contacted YouTube vlogger Louna Maroun to join the project. Maroun commented [...] "There's a huge fanbase for the zombie genre. It's so fresh and amazing that FremantleMedia are willing to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing. It's just a fan dream." [...] Forster wanted Neighbours: Zombies on Ramsay Street to be different from Neighbours, and said the visuals would reflect the dark nature of the story. Scenes were shot in both interior and external locations. An abandoned hospital and Kennedy bedroom sets were specially created for the series. Maroun appears at Hope Gottlieb, a past character who previously appeared in the show as a young child. The storyline sees Hope teaming up with Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) to try and stop a zombie invasion.|$|E

6000|$|... 'How <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> work suit you, Tregarva, for I don't {{like it at}} all! The fighting's {{all very}} well, but it's a poor cause.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not {{phone to}} the hotel?" [...] said Mr. Pett. It seemed to Jimmy and Ann {{that he was}} <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing on purpose. [...] "Which hotel did you leave them at?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Love you?" [...] said I, then I sighed, {{and then}} I gazed upon her sweetly-- For I think I <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing {{particularly}} neatly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that I like to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> work," [...] she explained, in {{reference}} to the cookery; [...] "but because I can't get away from Dad's training." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "People {{sometimes}} ask me," [...] {{said the}} low comedian, brushing the dust off his knees, [...] "why I <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing off the stage. It amuses me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm so to speak, as it were, kind of {{responsible}} for you. What I {{mean to say}} is, if you go <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing I'm apt {{to get in the}} soup somewhat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't know," [...] she replied. [...] "Men have <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing before--but it isn't often," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "that {{a man has}} done it {{for the sake of}} another man." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{took them}} aback at first. There {{were people who}} <b>did</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing. People of no class, who called {{themselves}} names and took up things. But for people of social standing to talk about serious subjects--except, perhaps, in bed to one's wife! It sounded so un-English.|$|R
60|$|JAMES. You {{may depend}} on it, my boy, if a {{man is going to}} <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing he'll do it, {{pressure}} or no pressure; if he isn't nothing'll make him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't believe Cutch Behar is {{anywhere}} near the Himalayan region," [...] interrupted Bertie. [...] "You ought to have an atlas on hand when you <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing; and why stale and pale?" ...|$|E
60|$|I learnt {{from the}} young lady {{that he was an}} English-born fox-terrier. That {{explained}} everything. The foreign dog does not <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing. The foreigner is born good: that is why we hate him.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{handwritten}} note above Joe Wilsons editorial by Vice President Dick Cheney. Cheney wrote: [...] "Have they <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing before?" [...] "Send an amb(assador) {{to answer}} a question?" [...] "Do we ordinarily send people out pro bono to work for us? [...] "Or did his wife send him on a junket?".|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{very kind}} of you, my good girl," [...] B. said, [...] "but really I don't think we can. I don't think we ought to. You must not go on <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing. We will drink this one {{now that you have}} brought it, but we really must insist on its being the last." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Queequeg," [...] said I, {{when they}} had dragged me, the last man, to the deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water; [...] "Queequeg, my fine friend, <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing often happen?" [...] Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he gave me to {{understand}} that such things did often happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{ought to}} be a boy to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing. Do you think it's right to ask it of me?" [...] cried Christie, feeling that being servant was not as {{pleasant}} a task as she had thought it.|$|E
60|$|Well, I {{started off}} to {{interview}} Mrs. Darrell, and, believe me, I didn't like the prospect. I {{think they ought}} to train A. D. T. messengers to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing. I found her alone. The rush hour of clients hadn't begun.|$|E
6000|$|Sometimes {{people would}} stay {{long after the}} shop was closed--"They don't mind a bit at Shalford's," [...] these ladies used to say--it is always ladies <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing--and while they loitered it was {{forbidden}} to touch a wrapper, or take any measures to conclude the day until the doors closed behind them.|$|E
50|$|The story {{focuses on}} a group of young kids who were all {{attending}} a crowded comic book store on the day when a seeming magic box broke open. Unnoticed by most, many {{of the people in the}} store were affected by the box's energies. It is later implied the box was harmless, given out by a mentally sick woman who has <b>done</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing before.|$|R
5000|$|Antón de Marirreguera {{had been}} known as a writer since his days at {{university}} and his works became very popular when he was alive. However, {{most of them are}} lost today. According to González Posada, Antón de Marirreguera himself asked his nephew to burn some of his papers just before his death, because he didn't want it to be said that a priest [...] "amused himself <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing".|$|R

I've {{had enough}} of this; I can't stop talking here all day; I want the child--so just deliver her up at once, will you?--and turn out Peck {{as soon as you}} like after. I'll cure them both <b>of</b> ever <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing again! I'll make them stick tight to the circus for the future! I'll show them--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Downes," [...] Colonel Chambers said, [...] "it {{seems to}} me that these two {{brothers}} are born to get into adventures and to get well out of them.

6000|$|... "No!" [...] she said, [...] "I {{am afraid}} I couldn't do that, {{but if it}} really gives you any {{satisfaction}} to hear it, I think that my search--I told you that I had come to look for some one, didn't I?--will be over to-night, {{and then it will}} not be necessary for me to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing." ...|$|E
60|$|But the Snoopopaths, Man and Woman, can't <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing, or, at any rate, the snoopopathic writer won't let them. The {{opportunity}} {{is too good}} to miss. As soon as The Man comes into The Woman's room--before he knows who she is, for she has her back to him--he gets into a condition dear to all snoopopathic readers.|$|E
50|$|Thompson and Phelps {{had gotten}} {{tremendous}} Arbitron ratings by <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing during morning drive-time {{on the radio}} in Los Angeles, but received only very low Nielsen ratings doing it on prime time television. Despite tremendous promotion of the duo by NBC, particularly during the NFL games that frequently served as its lead-in, the program was cancelled in November, although it was rerun {{in the summer of}} 1992, along with the unaired episodes.|$|R
2500|$|Hill {{says that}} the six party talks with North Korea have {{opened the door for}} {{fruitful}} dealings between the US and China in other areas.

[...] "At some point {{we have to figure out}} a way to deal with 1.3 billion people, and I think the six-party process has been a good one for that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' he said. 'Ah! now you've done it! Now you've given {{yourself}} away! You {{did it on}} purpose. You mixed those {{tickets on}} purpose. I thought as much. Say, {{who do you think}} you are, <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing? Don't you know that professional dancers are three for ten cents? I could go out right now and whistle, and get a dozen girls for your job. The boss'll sack you just one minute after I tell him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He made {{a slight}} gesture to himself, as if {{accepting}} an inevitable defeat, {{and turned to}} his companion, who was slowly reviving under the active ministration of the two women.

6000|$|... 'Now look here, Bill,' he said, 'this isn't the way {{we usually}} <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thing, and if the {{governor}} were here he would spend {{an hour and a}} half rambling on about testators and beneficiary legatees, and parties of the first part, and all that sort of rot. But as he isn't here I want to know, as one pal to another, what you've been doing to an old buster of the name of Nutcombe.' ...|$|E
60|$|Jules did not reply, for the {{excellent}} {{reason that he}} had not been woken up. Constant practice enabled him to <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> work without breaking his slumber. His brain, if you could call it that, was working automatically. He had shut up the gate with a clang and was tugging sluggishly at the correct rope, so that the lift was going slowly up instead of retiring down into the basement, but he was not awake.|$|E
500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. When I heard it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Hogan of The Telegraph {{called it}} [...] "pretty painful: 25 minutes {{that felt like}} 75, with telegraphed jokes and interminable scenes. Justin “Mr Tumble” Fletcher <b>does</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> clowning better over on CBeebies." [...] The idea that the series {{would be better served}} on a childrens network was echoed by commenters on the trailer on YouTube.

(The reader may go on <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{thing at}} some length for himself; and may imagine, if he pleases, a boastful {{conversation}} among the Pompeians at the baths, in which the barbarians hear how Agricola has broken the backbone of a rebellion in Britain; and {{in which all the}} speakers begin their observations with [...] "Ho! my Lepidus!" [...] and [...] "Ha! my Diomed!" [...] In the mean time we return to the present day, and step down the Street of Plenty along with Ventisei.) ...|$|R
