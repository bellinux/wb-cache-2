25|$|In May 1980 Union Rotorua was on {{passage from}} Tauranga to Sydney when she broke down 200 {{miles west of}} Cape Maria van Diemen. Union Rotoiti was only 80 miles away and the two masters agreed to attempt a tow. Captain Andrew Keyworth, {{one of the most}} senior masters of the USSCo, was the master of Union Rotoiti. With much skill on his part, and while the ships were {{sometimes}} only 25 metres apart, a line was made fast between the two ships by use of a line-carrying rocket. Once the tow began 422nm were covered in just over 56 hours at an average speed of 7.5 knots. It was a feat never before accomplished with two ships of this size, and Captain John Warren of Union Rotorua later exclaimed: ‘If anyone had previously tried to tell me it was possible … <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> them quite barmy’.|$|E
500|$|December 1967 {{also saw}} the release of Their Satanic Majesties Request (UK No. 3; US No. 2), which {{received}} unfavourable reviews and was widely regarded as a poor imitation of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Satanic Majesties had been recorded in difficult circumstances while Jagger, Richards and Jones were dealing with their court cases. The band parted ways with Oldham during the sessions. The split was amicable, at least publicly, but in 2003 Jagger said: [...] "The reason Andrew left was because he thought that we weren't concentrating {{and that we were}} being childish. It was not a great moment really – and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> it wasn't a great moment for Andrew either. There were a lot of distractions and you always need someone to focus you at that point, that was Andrew's job." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Esquire in 2015 Fairey said that Obama had not lived up to his expectations, [...] "not even close". He continued, [...] "Obama has had a really tough time, {{but there have been}} a lot of things that he's compromised on that I never would have expected. I mean, drones and domestic spying are the last things <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2011 The Welsh Government {{was accused}} by Tory {{councillor}} Peter Davies (father of MP Philip Davies) of sex discrimination for supporting International Women's Day with grants totalling £30,000 while ignoring International Men's Day. Davies stated, [...] "I don't particularly {{object to the}} Welsh Government spending money on International Women's Day, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that with its commitment to equality {{it would also be}} happy to recognise International Men's Day, which will be celebrated this Saturday." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liddle {{responded by}} saying:So, Crispin Blunt MP feels hurt because laws proscribing [...] (or 'poppers') would criminalise the entire gay community. ... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that the {{requirement}} for amyl nitrate to relax the sphincter muscle and lube to accommodate entry was God's way of telling you that what you're about to do is unnatural and perverse.

2500|$|While the {{insanity}} explanation {{was not uncommon}} during Swedenborg's own time, it is mitigated by his activity in the Swedish Riddarhuset (The House of the Nobility), the Riksdag (the Swedish parliament), and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Additionally, the system of thought in his theological writings is considered {{by some to be}} remarkably coherent. [...] Furthermore, he was characterized by his contemporaries as a [...] "kind and warm-hearted man", [...] "amiable in his meeting with the public", speaking [...] "easily and naturally of his spiritual experiences", with pleasant and interesting conversation... An English friend of Kant's who visited Swedenborg at Kant's behest described Swedenborg as a [...] "reasonable, pleasant and candid man and scholar". Of note here is Swedenborg's statement that he was commanded by the Lord to publish his writings and [...] "Do not believe that without this express command <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> of publishing things which I knew in advance would make me look ridiculous and many people would think lies..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lomax was a {{consultant}} to Carl Sagan for the Voyager Golden Record sent into space on the 1977 Voyager Spacecraft to represent {{the music of the}} earth. Music he helped choose included the blues, jazz, and rock 'n' roll of Blind Willie Johnson, Louis Armstrong, and Chuck Berry; Andean panpipes and Navajo chants; Azerbaijani mugham performed by two balaban players, a Sicilian sulfur miner's lament; polyphonic vocal music from the Mbuti Pygmies of Zaire, and the Georgians of the Caucasus; and a shepherdess song from Bulgaria by Valya Balkanska; in addition to Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, and more. Sagan later wrote that it was Lomax [...] "who was a persistent and vigorous advocate for including ethnic music even at the expense of Western classical music. He brought pieces so compelling and beautiful that we gave in to his suggestions more often than <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> possible. There was, for example, no room for Debussy among our selections, because Azerbaijanis play bagpipe-sounding instruments [...] and Peruvians play panpipes and such exquisite pieces had been recorded by ethnomusicologists known to Lomax." [...] He died in Safety Harbor, Florida on July 19, 2002 at the age of 87.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 August 2009, while commentating on {{the fourth}} Ashes Test at Headingley that season, Botham was invited {{to take part in}} an on-field {{ceremony}} to induct him into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame along with the Yorkshire greats Wilfred Rhodes, Fred Trueman and Geoffrey Boycott. Geoff Boycott was also in attendance, along with Fred Trueman's widow Veronica and Colin Graves who, as Yorkshire County Cricket Club chairman, accepted the honour on behalf of Wilfred Rhodes. Botham said: [...] "To be named amongst 55 of the most prolific players in cricketing history is a great honour for me. To have my cricketing career recognised in the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame is not something <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> when I began playing cricket but to be receiving this award today is something I'm extremely grateful for". Colin Graves included Botham in his tribute to Rhodes when he said: [...] "It is a great honour to accept the cap on behalf of a Yorkshire legend. Wilfred Rhodes was an exceedingly gifted player and is rightly regarded as one of England's greatest all-rounders. I am also delighted to see two other great Yorkshiremen and another great all-rounder inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame today".|$|E

6000|$|... "Strange!" [...] muttered Tom Collins, as {{they turned}} towards the rock; [...] "that does not look like an Indian mark; yet <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>thought</b> that white men had never stood here before, for the spot is far removed from any known diggings, and, as we know fail well, is not easily reached." ...|$|E

"For instance, if {{the emperor}} had demanded that I should {{afterward}} furnish him with Russian troops against {{any of his}} enemies, {{in exchange for his}} service in aiding me, or large sums of money, I should have done whatever he pleased.
