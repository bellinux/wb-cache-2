40|$|Multikey Sorting „ is {{arranging}} a {{sequential file}} according to ascending or descending {{on more than}} one keys or one columns. This paper considers a modified version of Binary Insertion Tree to sort records on several keys with the possibility of mixing the order of keys. I. e. ascending on some keys and descending on some keys. Existing techniques consider sorting directly on all the keys either in ascending or descending order. The proposed method overcomes this limitations, and use dynamic variables to allow sorting of files with sizes comparable to the memory available to the user. It achieves an average number of comparisons comparable to the best known sorting algorithms, since inserting N records into an initially empty tree needs the same average number of comparisons between records. This paper compares its execution with <b>Exchange</b> <b>Sort,</b> Selection Sort and Quick Sort and shows a big difference in speed, execution and storage. The algorithms for multikey sorting by <b>Exchange</b> <b>sort</b> technique, Selection sort technique, Quick sort technique and the proposed method are studied and implemented in Pascal Language...|$|E

These traditional methods – <b>exchange</b> <b>sort,</b> divide and conquer sort, selection sort and insertion sort – require supervisory control program. The supervisory control program {{has access to the}} items and is responsible for arranging them in the proper order. This paper presents a different sorting algorithm that does not require supervisory control program. The objects sort themselves and they are able to terminate when sorting is completed. The algorithm also employs parallel processing mechanisms to increase its efficiency and effectiveness. The paper makes a review of the traditional sorting methods, identifying their pros and cons and proposes a different design based on conceptual combination of these algorithms. Algorithms designed were implemented and tested in Java desktop application...|$|E

50|$|Shellsort, {{also known}} as Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place {{comparison}} sort. It {{can be seen as}} either a generalization of <b>sorting</b> by <b>exchange</b> (bubble <b>sort)</b> or sorting by insertion (insertion sort). The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared. Starting with far apart elements, it can move some out-of-place elements into position faster than a simple nearest neighbor exchange. Donald Shell published the first version of this sort in 1959. The running time of Shellsort is heavily dependent on the gap sequence it uses. For many practical variants, determining their time complexity remains an open problem.|$|R

30|$|However, the {{expansion}} of the range of educational opportunities has increasingly required teachers to teach learners with various levels of background knowledge. Depending on learners’ prior knowledge, a teacher would have to adjust the content or intent of instructions, such as the point where the learners should focus on the algorithm or program, or the abstraction or generalization degree of instruction. Almost all of the existing systems disallow these variations of the teacher’s intent and visualize the world of the target domain with a fixed visualization policy. Moreover, although existing systems tend to focus on reproducing the entire flow of algorithm behavior, knowledge related to the algorithm is also important in algorithm education. For example, properties of an algorithm such as the number of comparisons or <b>exchanges</b> in <b>sorting</b> tasks are an important learning target.|$|R

An investor’s disposition coefficient estimated with one year of data forecasts that investor’s disposition effect and investment per-formance in subsequent years.

40|$|Abstract—The recent {{spread of}} {{personal}} digital assistants capable of connecting {{to the network}} has made Internet access a commonplace activity, enabling anyone to <b>exchange</b> all <b>sorts</b> of information via the network. As in the real world, {{a wide variety of}} human values exist on the Internet, which is a place where people can communicate and interact with each other. In this way, analyzing behavior when information propagates from one person to another during inter-personal exchanges on the Internet would be important for creating new social systems, but it has been difficult to represent complex human values in conventional agent-based simulations. With the aim of simulating how differences in human value systems can affect exchanges between people, this paper proposes an agent-based informationpropagation model for an Internet society using particle swarm optimization (PSO), which is a type of swarm-intelligence algorithm. This model facilitates the representation of diverse human values in the real world and the evolution of human society driven by changes in values, and makes it possible to analyze the effect of different value systems on information propagation. Simulation experiments reveal how differences in the community environments that exchange information and the features of their value systems affect the process of information propagation.
