A significant decrease in the reliability of such a channel is caused by capacitive crosstalk between adjacent wires. A more robust high-speed phase <b>encoded</b> <b>channel</b> can be designed by minimising its vulnerability to crosstalk noise. This paper investigates the impact of crosstalk on phase encoded transmission channels. A functional fault model is presented to formulate the problem. Three fault tolerant schemes are introduced {{which are based on}} information redundancy techniques and the partial order coding concept. These schemes are simulated with CADENCE using AMS CMOS 0. 35 µm process. Area overheads, performance and fault tolerant capability of those methods are compared.

40|$|SIRK is a K+ channel {{identified}} in grapevine (Vitis vinifera), {{belonging to the}} so-called Shaker family. The highest sequence similarities it shares {{with the members of}} this family are found with channels of the KAT type, although SIRK displays a small ankyrin domain. This atypical feature provides a key to understand the evolution of the plant Shaker family. Expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that SIRK is an inwardly rectifying channel displaying functional properties very similar to those of KAT 2. The activity of SIRK promoter region fused to the GUS reporter gene was analyzed in both grapevine and Arabidopsis. Like other KAT-like channels, SIRK is expressed in guard cells. In Arabidopsis, the construct is also expressed in xylem parenchyma. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments indicated that SIRK transcript was present at low levels in the berry, during the first stages of berry growth. After veraison, the period of berry development that corresponds to the inception of ripening and that is associated with large biochemical and structural modifications, such as evolution of stomata in nonfunctional lenticels and degeneration of xylem vasculature, the transcript was no longer detected. The whole set of data suggests that in the berries SIRK is expressed in guard cells and, possibly, in xylem tissues.

40|$|The {{initiation}} and {{propagation of}} damage mechanisms such as cracks and delaminations generate acoustic waves, which propagate through a structure. These waves {{can be detected}} and analyzed to provide the location and severity of damage {{as part of a}} structural health monitoring (SHM) system. This methodology of damage detection is commonly known as acoustic emission (AE) monitoring, and is widely used on a variety of applications on civil structures. AE has been widely considered for SHM of aerospace vehicles. Numerous successful ground and flight test demonstrations have been performed, which show the viability of the technology for damage monitoring in aerospace structures. However, one significant current limitation for application of AE techniques on aerospace vehicles is the large size, mass, and power requirements for the necessary monitoring instrumentation. To address this issue, a prototype multiplexing approach has been developed and demonstrated in this study, which reduces the amount of AE monitoring instrumentation required. Typical time division multiplexing techniques that are commonly used to monitor strain, pressure and temperature sensors are not applicable to AE monitoring because of the asynchronous and widely varying rates of AE signal occurrence. Thus, an event based multiplexing technique was developed. In the initial prototype circuit, inputs from eight sensors in a linear array were multiplexed into two data acquisition channels. The multiplexer rapidly switches, in less than one microsecond, allowing the signals from two sensors to be acquired by a digitizer. The two acquired signals are from the sensors {{on either side of the}} trigger sensor. This enables the capture of the first arrival of the waves, which cannot be accomplished with the signal from the trigger sensor. The propagation delay to the slightly more distant neighboring sensors makes this possible. The arrival time from this first arrival provides a more accurate source location determination. The multiplexer also identifies which channels are acquired by encoding TTL logic pulses onto the latter portion of the signals. This prototype system was demonstrated using pencil lead break (Hsu-Neilsen) sources on an aluminum plate. It performed as designed providing rapid low noise trigger based switching with <b>encoded</b> <b>channel</b> identification. this multiplexing approach is not limited to linear arrays, but can be easily extended to monitor sensors in planar ot three dimensional arrays. A 32 channel multiplexing system is under development that will allow arbitrary sensor placement. Another benefit of this multiplexing system is the reduction in the expense of data acquisition hardware. In addition, the reduced weight and power requirements are of extreme importance for proposed AE systems on aerospace vehicles...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Large {{conductance}} calcium- and voltage activated potassium (BK) {{channels are}} important determinants of neuronal excitability through effects on action potential duration, frequency and synaptic efficacy. The pore- forming subunits are encoded {{by a single}} gene, KCNMA 1, which undergoes extensive alternative pre mRNA splicing. Different splice variants can confer distinct properties on BK channels. For example, insertion of the 58 amino acid stress-regulated exon (STREX) insert, that is conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, <b>encodes</b> <b>channels</b> with distinct calcium sensitivity and regulation by diverse signalling pathways compared to the insertless (ZERO) variant. Thus, expression of distinct splice variants may allow cells to differentially shape their electrical properties during development. However, whether differential splicing of BK channel variants occurs during development of the mammalian CNS has not been examined. Results Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Taqman™ assays, we demonstrate that total BK channel transcripts are up regulated throughout the murine CNS during embryonic and postnatal development with regional variation in transcript levels. This upregulation {{is associated with a}} decrease in STREX variant mRNA expression and an upregulation in ZERO variant expression. Conclusion As BK <b>channel</b> splice variants <b>encode</b> <b>channels</b> with distinct functional properties the switch in splicing from the STREX phenotype to ZERO phenotype during embryonic and postnatal CNS development may provide a mechanism to allow BK channels to control distinct functions at different times of mammalian brain development. </p...|$|R

The experimental finding that initial steps in viral infection exhibit the same sensitivity to channel inhibitors as the viral K+ channels {{has led to}} the hypothesis that the channels are structural proteins located in the internal membrane of the virus particles. This hypothesis was questioned recently because proteomic studies failed to detect the channel protein in virions of the prototype chlorovirus Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 (PBCV- 1). Here, we used a mAb raised against the functional K+ channel from chlorovirus MA- 1 D to search for the viral K+ channel in the virus particle.
