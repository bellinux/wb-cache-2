A variation of the platform, a [...] "flex" [...] platform, is similar but has a cutter bar that can flex over contours and ridges to cut soybeans that have pods close to the ground. A flex head can cut soybeans as well as cereal crops, while a rigid platform is generally used only in cereal grains.|$|E

40|$|A {{development}} of oil palm pruner and harvester machinery design {{implemented in the}} field still faces a problem {{due to the lack}} of effective and efficient design which is need to be solved. It was noted that in order to develop the design, an early data and information of physical and mechanical properties of palm oil frond and stem fruits is critically important. The objective of the research was to obtain the physical and mechanical properties of palm oil frond and stem in order to develop the design of pruner and harvester machinery. The result showed that tool machinery was been advantageous by the physical properties of the plant i. e. the total weight of frond and leaf which enable to support the cutting process. The average of total weight of frond and leaf was 16. 8 kg. The diagonal cutting trajectory was been more advantageous because of total weight and frond shape toward to the different of the plant tissue area. The measurement result shows that cutting curve follows the time required for cutting. The comparison among cutting curve shows differences in cutting thickness or length. In this case, the thickness is linear with cutting time. Besides, those curves show differences at the height which determine the maximum value of tested material cutting resistance. Alternative solution for machinery development design is pruner-harvester for height plant below 6 m and among 6 to 12 m. For below 6 m, pruner-harvester was designed by incorporating motor as power source and cutter-disc as the <b>knife</b> <b>cutter.</b> That condition was relied on that estate which was maintenance intensively commonly used cutter-disc. Pruner-harvester above 6 m and up to 12 m was improved based on manual egrek-designed by adding fresh fruit bunch alley supply glide in order to keep the fruits still in intact form. The consideration was based on affectivity and efficiency. It also considers homogenous ecological of palm oil plant which should be maintained to reduce global warming effect.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Wood mouldings are long, narrow pieces of timber with ornamental profiles fonned on one or more faces. They are used in furniture, architecture and joinery industries and typical applications include door/window frames, skirting boards and picture frames. Conventionally, wood mouldings are produced by planing/moulding machines, where cutting edges, attached to rotating cutterheads, sever chips from advancing workpieces. The cutting edges are shaped specifically for each individual moulding profile; hence, the raw material is transfonned into the finished product with a single feed. When the production is to be changed from one profile to another, the conventional machines requite new <b>cutter</b> <b>knives</b> that are manufactured for the profile to be machined. This requitement introduces tooling and machine set-up costs which cannot be compensated in shorter production runs. In order to minimize the aforementioned costs in short production runs, this thesis aims at the holistic development of Profile Independent Wood-Moulding Machine (pIMM). In the PIMM concept, the profIle geometry is supplied directly from CAD drawings, and the profile-specific <b>cutter</b> <b>knives</b> of the conventional process are emulated by position control of a single cutting tool along software generated trajectories. This thesis approaches the PIMM from an integrated mechatronic design perspective. Alternative solutions for mechanical, electrical and software components of the system were generated and evaluated via mathematical modelling and simulation. Then, the selected solutions were realized in a proof-of concept PIMM system, {{and the effectiveness of}} the proposed method has been investigated through machining experiments. Overall, this research proposes a new machining method and demonstrates an integrated design process that initiates from an idea and results in a fully functional, physical mechatronic system; via efficient use of software, simulation and rapid prototyping technologies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a real-life 1. 5 D cutting stock problem, which arises in a make-to-order plastic company. The {{problem is to}} choose a subset from the set of stock rectangles {{to be used for}} cutting into a number of smaller rectangular pieces so as to minimize total production cost and meet orders. The total production cost includes not only material wastage, as in traditional cutting stock problems, but also production time. A variety of factors are taken into account, like <b>cutter</b> <b>knife</b> changes, machine restrictions, due dates and other work in progress limitations. These restrictions make the combinatorial structure of the problem more complex. As a result, existing algorithms and mathematical models are no longer appropriate. Thus we developed a new 1. 5 D cutting stock model with multiple objectives and multi-constraints and solve this problem in an incomplete enumerative way. The computational results show that the solution procedure is easy to implement and works very well...|$|R
