Airports in the 1960s used <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflectors</b> with a height of , but airports in the 1990s needed deflectors that were twice as high, and even up to [...] high for jet airliners such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and MD-11, which have engines mounted in the tail above the fuselage. Airports often place their deflectors at the beginnings of runways, especially when roadways or structures are adjacent. Airports that are in dense urban areas often have deflectors between taxiways and airport borders. <b>Jet</b> blast <b>deflectors</b> usually direct exhaust gases upward. However, a low-pressure zone can form behind the blast fence, causing ambient air and debris to be drawn upward with the jet exhaust, and hot, toxic gases to circulate behind the blast fence. <b>Jet</b> blast <b>deflectors</b> {{have been designed to}} counteract this problem by using multiple panels and various angles, and by using slotted panel surfaces.|$|R

25|$|On 18 April 1915, the Morane-Saulnier L of Roland Garros was {{captured}} {{after he was}} shot down behind the German lines. From 1April, Garros had destroyed three German aircraft in the Morane, which carried a machine-gun firing through the propeller arc. Bullets that hit the blades were deflected by small metal wedges.

30|$|The {{process of}} the gas jet from {{aircraft}} engines impacting a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> {{is not only a}} complex fluid–solid coupling problem that is not easy to compute, but also a safety issue that seriously interferes with flight deck environment. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is used to simulate numerically the impact effect of gas jet from aircraft engines on a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> by using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations and turbulence models. First of all, during the pre-processing of numerical computation, a sub-domains hybrid meshing scheme is adopted to reduce mesh number and improve mesh quality. Then, four different turbulence models including shear-stress transport (SST) k-w, standard k-w, standard k-ε and Reynolds stress model (RSM) are used to compare and verify the correctness of numerical methods for gas jet from a single aircraft engine. The predicted values are in good agreement with the experimental data, and the distribution and regularity of shock wave, velocity, pressure and temperature of a single aircraft engine are got. The results show that SST k-w turbulence model is more suitable for the numerical simulation of compressible viscous gas jet with high prediction accuracy. Finally, the impact effect of gas jet from two aircraft engines on a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> is analyzed based on the above numerical method, not only the flow parameters of gas jet and the interaction regularity between gas jet and the <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> are got, but also the thermal shock properties and dynamic impact characteristics of gas jet impacting the <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> are got. So the dangerous activity area of crew and equipments on the flight deck can be predicted qualitatively and quantitatively. The proposed research explores out a correct numerical method for the fluid–solid interaction during the impact process of supersonic gas jet, which provides an effective technical support for design, thermal ablation and structural damage analysis of a new <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector.</b>|$|R
25|$|A <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> (JBD) or {{blast fence}} is a safety device that redirects the high energy exhaust from a jet engine to prevent damage and injury. The {{structure}} must {{be strong enough}} to withstand heat and high speed air streams as well as dust and debris carried by the turbulent air. Without a <b>deflector,</b> <b>jet</b> blast can be dangerous to people, equipment and other aircraft.|$|R
25|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} use <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflectors</b> at {{the rear}} of aircraft catapults, positioned to protect other aircraft from exhaust blast damage. <b>Jet</b> blast <b>deflectors</b> are made of heavy duty material that is raised and lowered by hydraulic cylinders or linear actuators. The <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> lies flush with and serves as a portion of the flight deck until the aircraft to be launched rolls over it {{on the way to the}} catapult. When the aircraft is clear of the deflector, the heavy panel is raised into position to redirect the hot jet blast. As soon as the deflector is raised, another aircraft can be brought into position behind it, and flight deck personnel can perform final readiness duties without the danger of hot, violent exhaust gases. Such systems were installed on aircraft carriers in the late 1940s and early 1950s, as jet-powered aircraft began to appear in navies.|$|R

30|$|The {{high-temperature}} and high-speed gas jet from {{aircraft engines}} {{is in an}} over expansion state when the aircraft engines are in full afterburner state to takeoff, which has a serious impact on the flight deck due to the complicated physical phenomena such as shock wave, noise and gas tempering caused by the interaction between gas jet and the <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> [1, 2]. The gas jet from aircraft engines has basic characteristics of supersonic flow and complex wave system. When the gas jet impacts a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector,</b> the thermal shock and dynamic impact will lead to thermal ablation and structure damage. The safety limits for pressure and temperature of the gas jet {{need to be considered}} due to the relatively small flight deck for carrying and taking off.

40|$|A Savonius rotor {{can develop}} a {{relatively}} high torque at a low rotational speed. It is cheap to build, but harnesses {{only a small fraction}} of the wind energy incident upon it. One proposal for augmenting the energy-harnessing effectiveness was to employ a V-shaped deflector mounted upstream of the rotor, apex into the wind, so that the air-flow resistance encountered by the half of the wind-turbine blade advancing (i. e. moving) into the wind was reduced. By (i) carrying out experimental tests with the deflector in different positions relative to the rotor, and (ii) varying the wedge angle between the <b>deflector</b> <b>blades,</b> an optimal configuration for the particular system tested was determined. With the optimally pitched deflector set at its optimal location, the rotor harnessed about 20 % more power, compared with the unblocked (i. e. standard) rotor both for an approximate wind speed of 4 ms- 1. Such a significant improvement, achieved by this simple cheap means, suggests that the use of the partially blocking wedge is highly desirable. ...|$|R
30|$|Because {{supersonic}} gas jet has {{the characteristics}} of high temperature, high pressure and high speed, {{there are two main}} difficulties in numerical computation. One is that the numerical computation of supersonic gas jet with complicated geometric model and flow characteristics is sensitive to initial field. The initial deviation from actual physical field will cause difficulty of convergence, even divergence at the beginning of computation. The other is that a high-precision discrete format, appropriate turbulence model and boundary conditions are needed to capture shock wave and expansion wave of the flow field, which leads to a long computation time and large memory usage. Therefore, domestic and foreign scholars usually use two-dimensional numerical simulation model to carry out the research [9 – 11]. But the flow information of two-dimensional numerical results is limited, which is unable to analyze the anisotropic impact effect of gas jet on a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector.</b> Three-dimensional numerical model was used by some scholars to simulate the impact process of gas jet, but the thermal shock effect of gas jet was not considered [12, 13]. According to the geometry of a single aircraft engine and {{the characteristics of}} gas jet, numerical simulation of the gas jet is made combined with different turbulence models. The high-precision results with SST k-w turbulence model are analyzed and verified. Then a scheme of sub-domains hybrid mesh is designed based on three-dimensional numerical model with coupling aircraft engines and a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector.</b> The parameters such as shock wave, velocity, pressure and temperature are got, and impact effect of the gas jet from aircraft engines on a <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflector</b> and the surrounding environment is analyzed.|$|R

5|$|Viktor Pugachyov, {{piloting}} {{the second}} Su-27K, {{became the first}} Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989. It {{was found that the}} carrier's <b>jet</b> blast <b>deflectors</b> were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60°; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45°. However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a Kamov Ka-27PS search-and-rescue helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.|$|R
