5000|$|Taylor {{was born}} in Miami and lived in South Florida {{with her parents and}} two older sisters. Taylor’s foray into the {{modeling}} world was largely due to being supermodel Niki Taylor's younger sister.

500|$|There {{were many}} critics among {{politicians}} and officials. Representatives {{of the police}} force in Sydney {{were among the most}} severe, and New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione, the head of APEC's lead security agency, was angered because the comedians could have been shot by police snipers, who were [...] "clearly... there because they mean business. They're not there for show." [...] In response, Licciardello expressed his faith in the snipers' professional ability: [...] "They are highly trained, competent people and they're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> people if they're in an Osama bin Laden costume if they clearly don't pose a threat".|$|E
500|$|William Petit {{had been}} able to free himself, escape his confines, and call to a {{neighbor}} for help. The neighbor indicated that he did not recognize him due to the severity of Petit's injuries. In court testimony, William Petit stated that he felt a [...] "jolt of adrenaline" [...] coupled with a need to escape upon hearing one of the perpetrators state: [...] "Don't worry, it's going to be all over in a couple of minutes."

500|$|Knowing {{that they}} could not match the quality of other computer-animated films, the film was instead {{designed}} to imitate the look of stop motion. Cory Edwards cited Rankin-Bass as an inspiration and explained, [...] "If we approach our look like that – photographed miniatures in stop-motion – and if that nostalgia resonates with our audience as far as that look, then we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> ourselves in the foot trying to put every freckle and hair on photoreal creatures." [...] Edwards contrasted the technically innovative, but critically panned 1986 film Howard the Duck with the simple, but beloved puppet character Kermit the Frog to illustrate to his crew the importance of well-written, likeable characters over technical quality.|$|E

500|$|The album's final parody is [...] "eBay", {{based on}} [...] "I Want It That Way" [...] by Backstreet Boys. In this song, the narrator {{describes}} {{a variety of}} obscure items that he purchased on the online auction site eBay. Yankovic later noted, [...] "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> a video for eBay, but right at the same time, eBay started doing all of these commercials with song parodies. [...] I didn't want my parody to come off as a commercial for eBay. In retrospect, I probably should have done a video {{because it would have}} been one of my biggest hits." [...] Indeed, the song is one of Yankovic's most popular, and ranks as one of his most-downloaded tracks on digital music outlets.|$|E
500|$|Residents of Mokhoyan, {{a village}} about 500 metres east of Camp Belamby, stated that a bomb had {{exploded}} in their vicinity on 8 March, destroying an armored vehicle and wounding several U.S. soldiers. They recounted that U.S. soldiers afterwards lined {{many of the}} male villagers against a wall, threatening to [...] "get revenge for this incident by killing at least 20 of your people," [...] and threatening that [...] "you and your children will pay for this". One Mokhoyan resident told The Associated Press [...] "It {{looked like they were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> us, and I was very afraid." [...] U.S. officials from The Pentagon declared that they had [...] "no evidence" [...] that villagers had been lined up against a wall and threatened in Mokhoyan. U.S. officials refused to confirm or deny that U.S. soldiers were wounded outside the village on 8 March.|$|E
500|$|The {{unexpected}} {{defeat of}} the Liberals was ascribed to various causes. The Ottawa Citizen stated that the defeat {{could be attributed to}} [...] "the uneasy talk... that the Liberals have been in too long." [...] Tom Kent of the Winnipeg Free Press, a future Liberal deputy minister, wrote that though the Liberal record had been the best in the democratic world, the party had failed miserably to explain it. Author and political scientist H.S. Ferns disagreed with Kent, stating that Kent's view reflected the Liberal [...] "assumption that 'Nobody's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> Santa Claus and that Canadians in the 1957 election were motivated by things other than material interests. Peter Regenstreif cited the Progressive Conservative strategy in the 1957 and 1958 elections [...] "as classics of ingenuity unequalled in Canadian political history. Much of the credit belongs to Diefenbaker himself; at least some must go to Allister Grosart". A survey taken of those who abandoned the Liberals in 1957 showed that 5.1% did so because of Suez, 38.2% because of the Pipeline Debate, 26.7% because of what they considered an inadequate increase in the old age pension, and 30% because {{it was time for a}} change.|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{has been}} {{recognized}} as a major health problem worldwide. The estimated number of infected individuals is over 170 million people worldwide (1). After hepatitis B, {{it is the most}} important cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, prevention of HCV infection {{is one of the most}} important public health concerns, because the majority of infected people would experience chronic hepatitis (2, 3). HCV can be easily transmitted through blood products transfusion and infected syringes. No surprise, the infection rate is remarkably high among injecting drug abusers (IDUs) (4, 5).

500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is quite dark and mysterious, {{as much of it}} is often {{interpreted}} to be dealing with issues such as substance abuse, suicide, and depression, with running themes of revenge, annihilation, seclusion, fear, loss, death, and discovery. Cornell was inspired by the writings of Sylvia Plath at the time. Commenting on the album's lyrics, Thayil said that [...] "a lot of Superunknown {{seems to me to be}} about life, not death. Maybe not affirming it, but rejoicing—like the Druids : 'Life is good, but death's gonna be even better!" [...] Cameron said that the lyrics on the album are [...] "a big fuck-you to the world, a plea to 'leave us alone. Cornell stated that [...] "Let Me Drown" [...] is about [...] "crawling back to the womb to die", [...] "Fell on Black Days" [...] is about realizing [...] "you're unhappy in the extreme", [...] "Black Hole Sun" [...] is about a [...] "surreal dreamscape", [...] "Limo Wreck" [...] is a [...] "'shame-on-decadence' song", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live" [...] is about [...] "trying to step out of being patterned and closed off and reclusive", and [...] "4th of July" [...] is about using LSD. Cornell talked about [...] "Mailman" [...] at a concert saying, [...] "This next one is about killing your boss. It's about coming to work early one morning cause you have a special agenda and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> him in the fucking head." [...] Conversely, [...] "Like Suicide" [...] was literal, written by Cornell after a bird flew into a window of his house. He found the severely injured animal and killed it, hitting it with a brick to end its suffering.|$|E

McG told people he suffered from fear of flying despite the issue being persistent agoraphobia. [...] "It was easier {{to say it was}} a fear of flying because, while it might make me look weak, people can understand it and I don't have to say, 'Well, I'm kind of crazy,'" [...] he told Fast Company. His brother died of a cocaine overdose in 2007, which he says has kept him grounded and reminds him not to take life for granted.|$|R
2500|$|Regarding Irv Kupcinet's {{connection}} to Jack Ruby, one year his senior, the Warren Commission determined that many {{men in their}} age bracket had interacted with Ruby in Chicago before 1947, when he moved from Chicago to Dallas.

Ecuadorian goalkeeper Marcelo Elizager saving a penalty from Carlos Tevez in a match between Ecuador and Argentina, revealed that he had studied some penalty kicks from Tévez and suspected he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> to the goalkeeper's left side.

5000|$|In his classic, Fighter Command Air Combat Claims, 1939-45 (1939-1940), John Foreman {{commented on}} the {{question}} of pilot temperament and ability.
