30|$|We {{found that}} the share of farmers {{participating}} in measure 121 (rdp_ 121) has a negative effect (- 0.6081) on the HNV farmland indicator due to the trade-off between measure 121 objective (<b>farm</b> <b>modernisation)</b> and the environmental measures of axis 2. OLS results show a positive impact (0.7216) of the organic farming payments on the HNV farmland indicator, due to the extensification of organic production compared with integrated or conventional systems.|$|E

The following variables were used as covariates: SFP per hectare of Usable Agricultural Area, (SFP), the logarithmic transformation of the cumulative sum of payments received from first (axis 1) and third RDP axes (axis 3); participation in measure 121, aimed at promoting <b>farm</b> <b>modernisation</b> (rdp 121), which was one the most relevant measures of the first axis in terms of budget.|$|E

Regionally-aggregated data were used, while potential spatial effects were taken into account. Results show that farm labour change was positively influenced by the participation to agroenvironmental schemes targeting the protection of water and biodiversity, but was not influenced by investment aids for <b>farm</b> <b>modernisation,</b> grassland premium, payments to organic farming conversion, or payments for the diversification of farm activities and rural tourism.

40|$|In some regions, {{small-scale}} low productivity <b>farms</b> persist despite <b>modernisation</b> {{pressures and}} policy pitfalls. This phenomenon {{calls for a}} deeper understanding of the dynamics at play which are largely bypassed in current academic debates, but are regaining momentum given the complex challenges faced by the agricultural sector. Some Mediterranean areas represent a particular case, characterised by a landscape of small farms, managed part-time, extending through high nature value areas, and producing reputable quality products. This research aims to unveil how this type of agriculture is reproduced. Through an enlarged notion of embeddedness this study explores the distinct farmers' strategies and their interdependencies in Alto Palancia County (Spain). For that purpose, semi-structured interviews were conducted in three municipalities that sought first to unveil the role of social and territorial embeddedness in reproducing the system, but also revealed the necessary contribution of capital flows from the local and regional economy as well as welfare state transfers. These findings shed light on the nature of part-time farming, which needs to be considered as part of a broader agricultural system. Furthermore, this paper calls for a more place-based and relational analytical framework in order to understand the reproduction of agricultural dynamics. This approach is paramount to assess public policy impacts – which go beyond agricultural policy measures – and improve the design of future interventions...|$|R
30|$|We {{found that}} there is a {{trade-off}} within RDP measures when pursuing several RDP objectives. This result is somewhat surprising in this context, and reflects a trade-off between RDP objectives: increasing productivity and <b>farm</b> <b>modernisation</b> (axis one of RDP) {{on the one hand and}} improving and maintaining environmental quality (axis two of RDP) on the other. At the same time, there is a need for better coherence in the design and implementation of RDP programs among the several RDP axis and with pillar I policy. Thus, the development of a comprehensive RPD program based on overall regional and territorial strategies seems to be a priority within the new programming.|$|E
40|$|Looking ahead, rural Europe faces {{significant}} challenges. Some {{of these}} are long-term and will require major adaptation, such as climate change, increasing scarcity of fossil fuels and the ageing indigenous population. Others are medium-term and subject to political uncertainty, such as economic stagnation and unemployment, pressures from in-migration, and constrained public finances. Markets appear {{likely to continue to}} encourage conventional <b>farm</b> <b>modernisation</b> and capitalization, but these may increase, rather than resolve, rural problems and tensions. Seen through an ecological lens, conventional patterns of development decrease rural social, environmental and economic resilience, and yet this is becoming increasingly important. New approaches are needed which can work with global and local processes to maintain rural diversity, quality and community: key factors in resilience-building. Interesting tactics may involve increasing local capacity to act, stimulating new local products, services and markets and new forms of pluri-activity. Business profitability and productivity will remain central, but can be realised in a variety of unconventional ways. Some examples and approaches are briefly presented and some general lessons identified for the new Rural Development Policy and Programmes, 2014 - 2020...|$|E
40|$|Rural areas across Europe face a {{range of}} problems, {{including}} declining farm incomes, ageing populations, unstable housing markets, high levels of outward migration or long distance commuting, withdrawal of basic services and difficulties faced by those without access to a car or public transport routes. The policy response at EU and national levels has been to shift from "productivist " measures that subsidise agriculture to strategies promoting "integrated rural development", emphasising the interconnections between various facets of the rural economy. Thus <b>farm</b> <b>modernisation,</b> training, and product processing and marketing are linked together with promotion of a more diverse economic base centred around tourism and recreation and the maintenance and development of services for local residents. An essential element of this model is its reliance on collaborative actions involving {{a range of}} community or civil society actors at local level.

This allows an assessment to be made of the contribution that such enterprises make to rural economic development as a whole. The conclusion is that they do have the potential to assist integrated rural development, but only as a small part of a much wider series of economic, social and environmental actions. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDairy {{farming is}} {{associated}} with an excess of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). The dairy industry has been changing for the past three decades with larger, more efficient farms and potentially less exposure to agents involved in COPD development. However, the impact of <b>farm</b> <b>modernisation</b> on COPD prevalence is unknown. We studied respiratory symptoms, respiratory function by spirometry and tobacco smoking in 575 male dairy farmers working either in traditional or in modern farms in the French Doubs region. COPD was defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criterion (forced expiratory volume in 1  s/forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) < 0. 70) and by the Quanjer reference equation (FEV 1 /FVC<lower limit of normal (LLN)). Modern farms were defined either as having a separation between the house and the cowshed (model 1) or as having a loose housing system for the animals (model 2). The prevalence of COPD in dairy farmers was 12. 0 ± 2. 7 % (GOLD), and 5. 6 ± 4. 1 % (LLN definition). By multivariate analysis using the LLN definition, tobacco smoking (OR (95 % CI) 3. 96 (1. 53 to 10. 3) and 3. 42 (1. 32 to 8. 84) for models 1 and 2, respectively) and characteristics of traditional farms (1. 97 (1. 02 to 4. 47) and 5. 20 (1. 73 to 15. 64) for models 1 and 2, respectively) were associated with higher COPD prevalence. Working in a traditional farm plus current smoking had an additive effect on COPD prevalence in model 1 and a synergistic effect in model 2. These findings support a positive impact of farm modernity on COPD prevalence in dairy farmers. Occupational and smoking-related risk factors are of nearly the same magnitude...|$|E
40|$|The Farm Improvement Programme (FIP) (Reg. 797 / 85) was {{introduced}} in Ireland in 1986 to replace the <b>Farm</b> <b>Modernisation</b> Scheme (FMS) (Dir. 159 / 92) of 1974 - 1985. Both schemes had similar objectives. Participants in each followed a grant aided farm development plan drawn up and operated in conjunction with their farm adviser. Nearly three quarters of farmers participated in either the FIP or FMS. This study was carried out on a sample of 145 FIP participant farms. The objective {{was to assess the}} impact of the measure on regional resource use. The average size of the farm business, as measured by standard gross margin, expanded by 15 per cent over the period of the plan. This compared with a planned increase of 9 per cent. Two-thirds of participants expanded the size of their businesses. Some outperformed their gross margin targets to a considerable extent. One-third of farms suffered a decline in gross margins. Stocking rate increased by 9 per cent from 1. 38 to 1. 5 livestock units per ha and the productivity of labour increased by 37 per cent. The internal rate of return to all resources involved (including farm investment, grant aid, administration and advisory costs) was high. Eighty to ninety per cent of the on farm development work was carried out by local labour. While sixty two per cent of applicants reported that they would not have made any investments without the aid of the scheme, 26 per cent said that they would have gone ahead in its absence. The conclusions from the study are as follows: Compared to the rest of Europe Irish agriculture is extensive and under capitalised with a high level of underutilisation of resources. It should therefore be a priority to increase the contribution of agricultural resources to rural and national development by improving their productivity. Because of the high and widespread participation of farmers in both schemes and the positive outcomes on the majority of participant farms, the FIP/FMS programmes seem to provide a suitable model for such development. ...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{significant}} progress in recent years, horizontal and vertical integration of the Lithuanian milk sector is not very much advanced. The primary sector is characterised by small-scale farming, the fragmentation of farmland and a low number of livestock per farms. These features cause severe problems regarding the restructuring and modernisation of agricultural production since only a few farmers possess the capital resources to conduct necessary investments. However, despite the unfavourable conditions Lithuanian milk producers have made significant improvements concerning milk quality. In the last decade, the processing sector was due to drastic concentration processes. These were induced by the strong competition processes on the milk market and fostered by foreign direct investors. Today, the market is dominated by three companies. About ten enterprises supply almost the entire market of dairy products. The main mode of governance {{in the market for}} raw milk is contractual arrangements. The spot market of strong vertical control are unimportant. The basic rules of the contracts like duration or payment scheme are set by the Ministry of Agriculture, others, especially prices, are negotiated individually between farmer and processor. Because of advantages in terms of transport and transaction costs processors provide better conditions to large agricultural producers. Often the processors try to strengthen their relationships with large-scale producers by providing credits for <b>farm</b> <b>modernisation</b> and/or foodstuff. Most small producers do not deliver directly to processors but to milk collection centres. In general, these are owned by processors. So far, only a few farmers co-operatives have been established in order to take this function. Contractual arrangements also dominate in the distribution channel. Small processors supply mainly to wholesalers who supply the retail market. Large processors often circumvent the wholesale stage and supply the retail stage directly. The basic means which allow this forward integration are intensive marketing activities which are intended to improve the consumer perception of their products. However, this type of exchange is mainly observed in urban areas where well established large retail chains exist. The Lithuanian milk sector is highly internationally competitive. The expansion to international markets is in the responsibility of the individual firms. However, the Lithuanian government and the food processors have established a joint marketing agency that provides infrastructure and joint marketing for international trade.
