40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the inuence of the MR scanner on dosimetry for the radiation modality, and to investigate the possible solutions for the dosimetric measurements discussed in section 1. 7. Chapter 2 investigates the feasibility to use a standardized national reference dosimetry protocol for the MR-linac. Firstly, the feasibility of using an ionisation chamber in an MR-linac was assessed by investigating possible inuences of the magnetic field on an NE 2571 Farmer type ionisation chamber characteristics: linearity, repeatability, orientation in the magnetic field; and AAPM TG 51 correction factor for voltage polarity and ion recombination. Secondly, the inuence of the permanent 1. 5 T magnetic field on the NE 2571 chamber reading was quantified. Chapter 3 presents the design and performance of a prototype MR-linac compatible scanning water phantom. In order to use a scanning water phantom, the performance of air filled ionisation chambers in the magnetic field must be characterised. The performance of the scanning water phantom will be validated at a clinical set-up in a 0 T magnetic field. Inside the MR-linac set-up, {{the performance of the}} MR-linac scanning water phantom is validated using radiographic film. Chapter 4 investigates the performance of the IC PROFILERTM, a multi-axis ionisation chamber array, in a 1. 5 T magnetic field. The inuence of the magnetic field on the IC PROFILERTM reproducibility, dose response linearity, pulse rate frequency dependence, power to electronics, panel orientation and ionisation chamber shape are investigated. IC PROFILERTM dose profiles were compared with film dose profiles obtained simultaneously in the MR-linac. Chapter 5 investigates the feasibility of using the STARCHECKTM multi-axis ionisation chamber array panel, in a transverse 1. 5 T magnetic field. The method of investigation is similar to that used for the IC PROFILERTM in chapter 4. The investigated characteristics are short term reproducibility, dose response linearity, accuracy of output factor measurements and the inuence of the magnetic field on a purposefully introduced misalignment. As a validation of feasibility, STARCHECKTM measurements were compared with film measurements simultaneously obtained in the MR-linac. Chapter 6 investigates the feasibility of using an MV portal imager in an MRlinac set-up. MV imaging integrated with the MR-linac has the potential to provide an independent position verification tool, a field <b>edge</b> <b>check</b> and a calibration for alignment of the coordinate systems of the MRI and the accelerator. A standard aSi MV detector panel is added to the system and both qualitative and quantitative performance are determined. Chapter 7 examines the performance characteristics of the ArcCHECK-MR QA system in a transverse 1. 5 T magnetic field. This ArcCHECK-MR system is used for QA of patient treatment plans. To this end, the short-term reproducibility, dose linearity, dose rate dependence, field size dependence, dose per pulse dependence and inter-diode variation of the ArcCHECK-MR diodes were evaluated on a conventional linac and on the MR-linac. Chapter 8 investigates the inuence of the closed bore MRI scanner structures on several radiation beam characteristics for squared fields of sizes 5. 6, 9. 8 and 23. 8 cm 2. The MR-linac set-up will be implemented into a Monte Carlo simulation environment facilitating dose profile simulations in a 1. 5 T magnetic field with and without MRI scanner structures. The results of the Monte Carlo simulations will be validated against scanning water phantom measurement results obtained in the MR-linac for the PDD and lateral profiles...|$|E

In a limestone karst rainforest of south China, two species of babblers breed in rock cavities in different seasonal periods: the endangered Nonggang Babbler (Stachyris nonggangensis) breeds in May, like most birds, and the common Streaked Wren Babbler (Napothera brevicaudata) breeds in March.

The higher predation rate during warmer weather, {{and the fact that}} eggs disappeared mostly at once, yet predators were not detected on infrared nest cameras, suggests that snakes could be important predators; {{further research is needed to}} confirm this hypothesis.

40|$|Computer {{security}} {{has become a}} central focus in the information age. Though enormous effort has been expended on ensuring secure computation, software exploitation remains a serious threat. The software attack surface provides many avenues for hijacking; however, most exploits ultimately rely on the successful execution of a control-flow attack. This pervasive diversion of control flow is {{made possible by the}} pollution of control flow structure with attacker-injected runtime data. Many control-flow attacks persist because {{the root of the problem}} remains: runtime data is allowed to enter the program counter. In this paper, we propose a novel approach: Control-Data Isolation. Our approach provides protection by going to the root of the problem and removing all of the operations that inject runtime data into program control. While previous work relies on CFG <b>edge</b> <b>checking</b> and labeling, these techniques remain vulnerable to attacks such as heap spray, read, or GOT attacks and in some cases suffer high overheads. Rather than addressing control-flow attacks by layering additional complexity, our work takes a subtractive approach; subtracting the primary cause of contemporary control-flow attacks. We demonstrate that control-data isolation can assure the integrity of the programmer's CFG at runtime, while incurring average performance overheads of less than 7 % for a wide range of benchmarks. 1...|$|R

40|$|Background: The senior {{consultants}} Ross Benger and Andrew Gal {{have been}} using en face frozen section histological margin control in removing cancer from the periocular region since 1985. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the percentage of cases in which more than one resection was necessary in order to achieve clear margins. Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients treated at Drummoyne Eye Surgical Centre in the period 1999 - 2007, in whom removal of the eyelid cancer was decided to be with en face frozen section histological control. A record was kept of how many resections were necessary to achieve clear margins. Paraffin sections were subsequently examined for a final histopathological diagnosis. Results: Two hundred and fifty people were included in the study, of whom 204 had basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 32 had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). One hundred and twenty BCCs had a full-thickness eyelid "wedge" resection, of which 45 % needed more than the standard two frozen sections taken to achieve clear margins. Eighty-four BCCs were removed using ring resection, of which 35. 7 % needed more than the standard initial resections (peripheral annulus and deep disc) to achieve clear margins. Conclusions: Our study showed that a significant percentage of BCC and SCC lesions needed further resection after the initial frozen section <b>edge</b> <b>checks</b> to achieve clear margins.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the potential of pre-treatment techniques to produce high quality back-sawn boards from regrowth messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua L'Herit), which is very prone to collapse and checking. Saturated urea solution, one percent sodium hydroxide, four percent acetic acid, water, urea formaldehyde resin (UF), and polyvinyl acetate glue (PVA) were used. In Chapter 4, the experiment of chemical soaking pre-treatments showed that soaking in sodium hydroxide solution for up to 15 days caused almost double increase of boards' drying rate. However, this technique and soaking in acetic acid solution caused more collapse and checks. In Chapter 5 and 6, the surface coating experiment confirmed that coating with UF resin did not significantly improve the drying properties of the boards. In contrast, PVA coating prevented surface checking and considerably reduced <b>edge</b> <b>checking</b> and collapse. The check value of these P boards was only a quarter the check value of control boards. In Chapter 6, the pre-treatments trial proved that significant reductions of shrinkage and collapse were achieved mainly by urea soaking for eight weeks (SSW boards). Both tangential and radial shrinkages of S 8 W boards were {{less than half the}} shrinkages of control boards. The collapse free boards of S 8 W were almost double amount of that in control boards.

Based on T-type ergative analysis (Aldridge 2004), in the cleft clause the T carries a structural absolutive case feature and the transitive v carries an EPP feature. When v carries an EPP feature, the DP operator is raised to the vP phase <b>edge</b> to <b>check</b> off [EPP] and is valued as the ABS case feature from T.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{algorithm}} to reconstruct 3 D surfaces from an unorganized point cloud based on gen-eralizing the MPU implicit algorithm through introducing a powerful orientation inference scheme via Belief Propa-gation. Instead of using orientation information like sur-face normals, local data distribution analysis is performed to identify the local surface property so as to guide the se-lection of local fitting models. We formulate the determina-tion of the globally consistent orientation as a graph opti-mization problem. Local belief networks are constructed by treating the local shape functions as their nodes. The con-sistency of adjacent nodes linked by an <b>edge</b> is <b>checked</b> by evaluating the functions and an energy is thus defined. By minimizing the total energy over the graph, we can obtain an optimal assignment of labels indicating the orientation of each local shape function. The local inference result is propagated over the model in a front-propagation fashion to obtain the global solution. We demonstrate the perfor-mance of the proposed algorithm by showing experimental results on some real-world 3 D data sets. 1...|$|R

Let MidP be the class of functions that give the medians in the outputs of metric Turing machines, where a metric Turing machine is a polynomial-time bounded nondeterministic Turing machine such that each branch writes a binary number on an output tape. Then it is shown that every function in PF(#P) is polynomial-time one-Turing reducible to a function in MidP and MidP ⊆ PF (#P); that is, PF(#P) = PF(MidP[1]). Furthermore, it is shown that for all sets L, L is in P(#P) if and only if there is a function F ∈ MidP, such that for every string x, x ∈ L, iff F(x) is odd. Thus the problem of computing medians in the outputs of metric Turing machines captures the computational complexity of P(#P) and PF(#P).

40|$|Massive network {{exploration}} is {{an important}} research direction with many applications. In such a setting, the network is, usually, modeled as a graph G, whereas any structural information of interest is extracted by inspecting the way nodes are connected together. In the case where the adjacency matrix or the adjacency list of G is available, one can directly apply graph mining algorithms to extract useful knowledge. However, there are cases where this is not possible because the graph is hidden or implicit, meaning that the edges are not recorded explicitly {{in the form of}} an adjacency representation. In such a case, the only alternative is to pose a sequence of edge probing queries asking for the existence or not of a particular graph <b>edge.</b> However, <b>checking</b> all possible node pairs is costly (quadratic on the number of nodes). Thus, our objective is to pose as few edge probing queries as possible, since each such query is expected to be costly. In this work, we center our focus on the core decomposition of a hidden graph.

The geometric attributes of the hand {{play an important role in}} hand shape reconstruction and gesture recognition. That said, fingertips are one of the important attributes for the detection of hand gestures and can provide valuable information from hand images. Many methods are available in scientific literature for fingertips detection with an open hand but very poor results are available for fingertips detection when the hand is closed. This paper presents a new method for the detection of fingertips in a closed hand using the corner detection method and an advanced edge detection algorithm. It is important to note that the skin color segmentation methodology did not work for fingertips detection in a closed hand. Thus the proposed method applied Gabor filter techniques for the detection of edges and then applied the corner detection algorithm for the detection of fingertips through the <b>edges.</b> To <b>check</b> the accuracy of the method, this method was tested on a vast number of images taken with a webcam.
