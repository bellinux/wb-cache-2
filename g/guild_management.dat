Although historical state {{of land use}} differs between subtropical and temperate zones, gradients of land-use intensities similarly range from unmanaged to very intensively managed forests. Irrespective of similar land use forces in both climate zones, comparative studies on land use effects are still rare. Such studies are, however, promising in discovering more general impacts and geographical specifics of land use intensification. We studied litter-dwelling invertebrates along a gradient of increasing land use intensity in subtropical forests in Southern Brazil and temperate forests in Central Europe using similar sampling designs. Effects of land use intensity on the entire community were analyzed {{on the level of}} orders and feeding guilds. In both climate zones a similar number of individuals were caught when standardizes to 100 pitfall trap days, but taxa richness was higher in the subtropics. Moreover, community composition differed between both climate zones. In both regions, land use intensity did not affect taxa richness, but invertebrate abundance was affected in opposite ways; while increasing land use intensity resulted in a decrease of invertebrate abundance in the subtropics, an increase was observed in the temperate zone and this was mostly consistent regarding different feeding <b>guilds.</b> <b>Management</b> practices should take into account that the effect of land use intensity on biodiversity can differ drastically among climatic regions...|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of Wednesday, July 31, 2013, {{nearly a third of}} the {{newsroom}} staff was eliminated through layoffs and voluntary resignations. The Plain Dealers corporate owner, New York-based Advance Publications Inc., a private company run by the heirs of S.I. Newhouse, under a strategy to focus more on online news delivery, had been cutting staff and publication schedules. Previously, in December 2012, under an agreement with the Newspaper Guild, nearly two dozen union newsroom staff voluntarily accepted severance packages. The July round of layoffs led to accusations by the <b>Guild</b> that <b>management</b> had misled the union by cutting more employees than had been agreed upon.|$|R

40|$|Ecotourism has a {{potentially}} vital {{role to play}} in conservation by generating economic incentives for nature conservation. However, some authors contend that this potential may be limited by narrow viewing preferences among visitors to protected areas, suggesting that most tourists are primarily interested in seeing charismatic mega-fauna largely confined to government or privately-owned parks. We assessed viewing preferences among tourists at four protected areas in South Africa to test the validity of this contention. Mega-herbivores and large carnivores were the most popular species, particularly among first-time and overseas visitors, but African visi-tors and experienced wildlife viewers were more interested in bird and plant diver-sity, scenery, and rarer, less easily-observed and/or less high-profile mammals. Several of these favored species are extinction prone and often absent from wildlife areas due to sensitivity to human encroachment and competition with more abundant species. Hence, ecotourism may provide incentives for the conservation of intact <b>guilds,</b> and <b>management</b> for ecotourism may align more closely with biodiversity conservation objectives than suggested by critics. This potential could be enhanced by diversification of tour operator advertising to feature aspects of biodiversity other than the ‘big five’. Nonetheless, charismatic mega-fauna have a vital flagship role by attracting most overseas and first-time visitors to protected areas. doi: 10. 2167 /joe 133. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: About 110 {{species of}} birds can be {{observed}} during the breeding season in California habitats where oaks form {{a significant part of}} the tree or shrub canopy. Many of these birds use the oaks for foraging, nesting, or perching, and many regularly eat acorns. A <b>guild</b> approach to <b>management,</b> with selection of appropriate indicator species, is recommended. Management of oak habitats for birds should emphasize maintenance of mixed-species, uneven-aged stands where sites permit, and should provide for a continuing, abundant supply of acorns. Large, old trees are particularly important to birds, because they provide a wider array of foraging sites, tend to produce more acorns, and are best suited to excavation of cavity nests. Where present, a shrub layer should be maintained. Management plans for oak stands must consider adjacent, non-oak sites...|$|R
40|$|Isolated {{trees have}} {{distinctive}} economic, {{social and cultural}} value for the Betsileo people {{living on the edge}} of the protected forest corridor between Ranomafana and Andringitra national parks, in South-East Madagascar. Many of these trees are Ficus spp., traditionally protected and respected. At the landscape level, they are isolated features in a heterogeneous mosaic, providing fruit, shade and aesthetic services in open cultivated areas. Within the current management system, isolated trees may also contribute significantly to the provision of ecological services by enhancing bird diversity in open areas outside the forest. We identified practices and values linked to isolated tree uses and management through ethnographic data collection. Bird presence and abundance were sampled by 338 point counts in isolated trees and open areas of the agricultural mosaic. Isolated trees were occupied by 18 out of 32 (56 %) bird species in the agricultural mosaic, including 8 (25 %) endemic forest species. Endemic forest birds were significantly more numerous in isolated trees than in open habitats, both in species richness and abundance (mean P value < 0. 001). Overall bird species richness was significantly higher in open areas containing isolated trees, than in areas without isolated trees. Bird species richness in Ficus spp. was significantly higher than in other isolated tree species, although no differences were detected in abundance or within <b>guilds.</b> Community-based <b>management</b> of isolated trees may thus represent an opportunity for convergence between bird conservation goals outside protected areas and local management values and practices...|$|R
40|$|Information {{about the}} use of floristic {{resources}} of the immediate edges of ombrophilous forest (Atlantic rainforest) fragments by stingless bees is not readily available in the scientific literature. Considering the importance of these plant species for local guilds of stingless bees, this study aimed to identify and characterize the flora of the immediate borders of four Atlantic rainforest fragments situated in Baturit&# 233; massif, state of Cear&# 225;, used as food resource by stingless bees. We studied the growth-form of the plants, the floristic similarity between edges and the effect of rainfall on the flowering, and suggested simple techniques for handling these areas. We compiled a total of 82 plant species with a predominance of tree and shrub form. There were different floristic richness between areas and rainfall had differentiated influence on flowering, according to the edge. We concluded that the florist components of the studied edges are relevant to the stingless bee <b>guilds,</b> but alternative <b>management</b> practices are needed to conserve both plant and bee species...|$|R
