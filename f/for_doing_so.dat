40|$|Culicover and Jackendoff (2005) {{argue that}} VP {{structure}} with adjunct modifiers is ‘‘flat’’: both complements and adjuncts are equally sisters of V. Their arguments center around the apparent misbehavior of <b>do</b> <b>so</b> {{as a replacement}} for a syntactic VP constituent. However, several of these arguments are inconclusive. The rule that Culicover and Jack-endoff offer <b>for</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> <b>does</b> not fare better overall than does the hier-archic VP account of <b>do</b> <b>so...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{year after}} joining Maples' firm, Benjamin changed his surname from D'Israeli to Disraeli. His reasons <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> are unknown, but the biographer Bernard Glassman surmises {{that it was}} to avoid being {{confused}} with his father.

5|$|A {{mandatory}} order is {{an order of}} the High Court which commands a public body to perform a public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing order. In such a case, the quashing order will set aside the unlawful decision, and the {{mandatory order}} will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory order cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hard Boiled was John Woo's last Hong Kong film {{before his}} {{transition}} to Hollywood. After making films that glamorized gangsters (and receiving criticism <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so),</b> Woo {{wanted to make}} a Dirty Harry styled film to glamorize the police. After the death of screenwriter Barry Wong, the film's screenplay underwent constant changes during filming. New characters such as Mad Dog and Mr. Woo were introduced, while the original plotline of a baby poisoning psychopath was cut.|$|E

Two years later, Hidjo has become district attorney of Djarak. Meanwhile, Walter has married Betje and returned to Surakarta to become assistant resident. Biroe marries Woengoe's brother Wardojo, {{who has become}} regent of the area. Roos marries the area's administrator, Boeren.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Turner {{appeared}} {{in her first}} Technicolor film, as Lady de Winter in The Three Musketeers, opposite Gene Kelly, Van Heflin, and June Allyson. In November 1947, she agreed to do the film, thereby giving up an unfinished film project called Bedeviled. However, in January 1948, {{it was reported that}} she had withdrawn from the film. Initially, Louis B. Mayer gave her permission <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> because of her schedule, but she was later that month put on suspension. Eventually, Turner agreed to make the film, but did not start production until March due to having to lose weight.|$|E
5|$|In vain, the King urged Conservative leaders Arthur Balfour and Lord Lansdowne to {{pass the}} Budget, which Lord Esher had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker {{agreements}} between the two Houses over Irish disestablishment in 1869 and the Third Reform Act in 1884. On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) as a reward <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} why this {{hurricane}} went unnamed, {{even though it}} clearly met the criteria <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b> Any statement about why is purely speculative at this point. The hurricane is the furthest north a tropical cyclone existed in the Eastern Pacific, and is also the northernmost existence for a Pacific hurricane. It was the only tropical cyclone {{to exist in the}} central Pacific this year. No damage or casualties were reported, although it did hassle a few ships.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the weight-reduction phase had {{included}} removing the anchors from the battleship, but Wallin ordered {{one of the}} anchors to be reattached. His reason <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> was that the anchor would effectively shift Missouris center of gravity forward to a narrower part of the battleship, thereby reducing the friction at her widest point. During this time, the Bureau of Ships offered valuable technical and salvage advice to both the civilian and military participants in the salvage effort.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{the protests}} started to {{extend to the}} local {{community}} when Jean Gosling, a lollipop lady in Wanstead, upon learning of the tree's impending destruction, rallied the support of local children (and was later fired from her job <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> while wearing her uniform), who in turn recruited their parents into the protests. It was then that the non-resident radicals realised that they had significant local support. When local residents gathered for a tree dressing ceremony on 6 November, they found their way barred by security fencing. With support from the protesters, they pulled it down.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Appeal {{emphasized}} that the approach taken in that case made no formal distinction between procedural and substantive unfairness. Substantive legitimate expectation does not intrude upon the executive's policy-making powers, {{as it is for}} public authorities, acting within their statutory powers, to adopt or change policies. The reasons <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> are not usually open to judicial review. On the other hand, it is the job of the courts to determine whether an authority's application of a policy to an individual who has been led to expect something different is a just exercise of power.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 {{to convert it}} from iron to steel. It was {{repeatedly}} reinforced throughout its existence.

50|$|Foraging can be {{categorized}} into two main types. The first is solitary foraging, when animals forage by themselves. The second is group foraging.

He enlisted the aid of Van Melkebeke, Guy Dessicy, and Frans Jageneau to help finish Prisoners; they gathered at his home on the Avenue Delleur and produced many of the backgrounds within the story. He also employed his friend Bernard Heuvelmans to help devise the ending of the story; he paid Heuvelmans 43,000 Belgian francs <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E

After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested. He walked out of the village, moved to the city, and went on to acquire much wealth.|$|E
5|$|By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, {{which was}} {{by that point}} {{pursuing}} the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered {{the main body of}} the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>so</b> would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of the II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.|$|E
