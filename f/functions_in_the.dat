5|$|A {{number of}} methods to perform {{sterilization}} via the cervix are being studied. One involves putting quinacrine in the uterus which causes scarring and infertility. While {{the procedure is}} inexpensive and does not require surgical skills, there are concerns regarding long-term side effects. Another substance, polidocanol, which <b>functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same manner is being looked at. A device called Essure, which expands when placed in the fallopian tubes and blocks them, was approved in the United States in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In biology, manganese(II) ions {{function}} as cofactors {{for a large}} variety of enzymes with many functions. Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of superoxide free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental oxygen. Manganese also <b>functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthetic plants. While the element is a required trace mineral for all known living organisms, it also acts as a neurotoxin in larger amounts. Especially through inhalation, it can cause manganism, a condition in mammals leading to neurological damage that is sometimes irreversible.|$|E

5|$|The low {{concentration}} of calcium in the cytosol allows calcium ions {{to function as}} a second messenger in calcium signaling. Here, a signal such as a hormone or an action potential opens calcium channels so that calcium floods into the cytosol. This sudden increase in cytosolic calcium activates other signalling molecules, such as calmodulin and protein kinase C. Other ions such as chloride and potassium may also have signaling <b>functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cytosol, but these are not well understood.|$|E

5|$|The central Vishnu {{head and}} side heads of Varaha and Narasimha may be {{influenced}} by other configurations in architecture. For example, Vishnu, Varaha and Narasimha may be depicted on back (western) and side (northern/southern) walls of temples. Varaha (rescues the earth from the cosmic waters at the beginning of an eon), Vishnu (as a human) and Narasimha (destroying a demon) may represent creation, preservation and destruction - the three <b>functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hindu universe. Vaikuntha Chaturmurti represents Vishnu as the Supreme Being, Creator of the Universe. Also, Varaha and Narasimha are oldest in antiquity (avatars Matsya and Kurma which are described in sacred texts to be appearing before Varaha and Narasimha were associated with Vishnu at a later date). Their presence in the iconography of Vaikuntha Chaturmurti suggests that this form originated in the Gupta era, where their cults were at their peak.|$|E

40|$|It was {{reported}} that Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene polymorphism and fruit and vegetable (FV) intake were associated with body antioxidant capacity. The oxidative/anti-oxidative imbalance {{played an important role}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pathogenesis of AD. However, the association of GST genotype, dietary FV consumption with body antioxidant biomarkers and cognitive <b>function</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly is not clear. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the association of GST genotype, and dietary FV intake, with antioxidant biomarkers and cognitive <b>function</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly. Food frequency questionnaire was used to collect data of dietary FV intakes in 504 community dwelling elderly aged from 55 to 75 years old. GSTM 1 and GSTT 1 genotypes were determined by using multiple-PCR method. Plasma and erythrocyte antioxidant biomarkers were measured. Cognitive function was measured by using Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Statistical analysis was applied for exploring the association of GST genotype and FV intake with antioxidant biomarkers level and cognitive <b>function</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly. Individual GSTM 1 or GSTT 1 gene deletion affects body antioxidant biomarkers levels, including erythrocyte GST activity, plasma total antioxidant capacity, and glutathione levels. GSTM 1 and/or GSTT 1 gene deletion have no effects on cognitive <b>function</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> surveyed participants. The effect of GST genotype on antioxidant biomarkers are FV intake dependent. There is interaction of FV intake and GST genotype on cognitive <b>function</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly. GST genotype or daily FV consumption impact body antioxidant biomarkers, but not cognitive <b>function</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly. There were combined effects of GST genotype and FV consumption on cognitive <b>function</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly population. Large scale perspective population study is required to explore the association of GST genetic polymorphism, FV consumption and antioxidant biomarkers and cognitive <b>function</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly...|$|R

5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of environmental health or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological <b>functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E
5|$|Worcestershire's {{boundaries}} {{were relatively}} stable before the Victorian era, although some parishes or Manors changed hands with neighbouring counties, usually as 'gifts' by the monarchy, church or through conquest. In 1844; {{the administration of}} Worcestershire {{was carried out by}} the Courts of Quarter Sessions, who were responsible for law and order, civil jurisdiction and certain administrative <b>functions</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county. These roles included the licensing of alehouses, police, weights and measures, construction/maintenance of highways and bridges, poor law disputes and setting taxes. The county was then divided into five hundreds (a county subdivision), four separate boroughs for the larger towns (Bewdley, Kidderminster, Droitwich, and Evesham), and Worcester itself, which was a county corporate. Worcester was autonomous from Worcestershire and the boroughs had a certain degree of autonomy within the hundreds.|$|E
