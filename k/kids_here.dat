[...] Lise sat up, seemingly finding relief in the relation of her wrongs, dabbing her eyes with a cheap lace handkerchief. [...] "Well, while he'd been away--this thing came. I didn't know what was the matter at first, and when I found out I was scared to death, I was ready to kill myself. When I told him he was scared too, and then he said he'd fix it.

And it was the good kids in my ward who first threw the bricks through the windows. Then the adults stepped in.

5000|$|Alternatively, some {{residents}} disagree with Port Arthur Refinery's local benefits. Concerns over pollution are acute {{in the local}} community. Edward Brooks II, a Port Arthur resident says, [...] "They government {{tell us about the}} emissions but they don’t do anything about it. They don’t care. Half the <b>kids</b> <b>here</b> need help breathing. A lot of them have breathing machines at home and at school." [...] Additionally, majority of the populations around the refineries come from minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged background and lack resources to move to a less polluted area. However, local community leaders have found ways to find common ground with refinery representatives. Hilton Kelley, another Port Arthur resident, is a prominent leader in the campaign for restrictions on emissions and reparations for medical costs. His approach emphasizes the refineries' local economic importance, but calls on representatives to [...] "clean up their act". After much community organizing and campaigning, Kelley negotiated a $2 million Community Enhancement Agreement with Motiva, to improve housing, social opportunities, and community programs.

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, advised that the episode is [...] "best if watched with Australians who will be, perhaps understandably, aggrieved at their portrayal.
