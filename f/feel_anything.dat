Alphonse loses his entire body while he and Edward are trying to revive his mother Trisha using alchemy. Edward sacrifices his right arm to seal Alphonse's soul into a suit of armor. Edward later becomes an alchemist from the state military of Amestris, and starts traveling with Alphonse to search for a method to recover Alphonse's body. They seek the Philosopher's Stone, which would allow them to restore their physical forms. Besides being a powerful alchemist, Alphonse is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter; having been trained by Izumi Curtis. While Alphonse cannot <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> because he has no body, he is nearly invincible as long as the blood mark made by Edward on his armor to contain his soul is not defaced.|$|E
5|$|Graham visits Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) and {{describes}} his visions, to which Henry replies {{that he must}} be the queen's Huntsman. The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and bring it back to her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> with Regina because he does not have a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which {{turns out to be the}} tomb of Henry Mills. Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there.|$|E

Bridget joins Declan Napier when he begins joyriding. During a race with Justin, they are pursued by the police. They return home thinking they escaped, {{only to find the}} police waiting for them. Bridget is banned from seeing Declan, but she sneaks out to meet him at the park, where they argue. On her way home, Bridget trips and falls into the road in front of a car being driven by Susan Kennedy. Susan blacks out, a result of suffering from multiple sclerosis, and hits Bridget. She drives off, unaware of what she has done. Bridget is found and rushed to the hospital, where she undergoes emergency surgery for a bleed on her brain. She remains unconscious, until Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) visits and pleads with her to wake up. Bridget's hand moves and she awakes the next day. However, she cannot <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> down the left side of her body and she is told that she could be permanently disabled. Susan realises that she caused the accident and comes forward. She is arrested and put on trial. Bridget remembers that she fell into the road and that the accident was not Susan's fault, and she tells the court. During a rehabilitation class at the swimming pool, Bridget meets Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). Following a disastrous date with Declan, where Bridget is given the impression that Declan cannot handle her disability, Bridget begins dating Josh. Following a roof collapse at an illegal dance party, Bridget and Josh are both trapped in rubble. Declan carries Josh out before coming back for Bridget.

50|$|One night, Dante convinces Ari to kiss him, {{saying it}} is an {{experiment}} as he has never kissed another boy and {{wants to know if}} he <b>feels</b> <b>anything</b> from kissing Ari. While reluctant, Ari agrees and Dante kisses him with Ari briefly kissing him back. Afterwards, Ari claims to have felt nothing while Dante is upset as he felt something with the kiss, seeming to confirm Dante has feelings for Ari. Following this event, it becomes increasingly clear that Dante is in love with Ari who appears not to reciprocate Dante's feelings for him.|$|R

She tells her sister Rachel that she's going west with Patience as her mate, and Rachel, upset by being {{replaced}} to go west by Patience, tells their father who beats Sarah, then drags her to Patience's home to demand to know the nature of their relationship.

25|$|The Royal Fine Art Commission was {{instrumental}} in the choice of the British standard kiosk. Because of widespread dissatisfaction with the GPO's design, the Metropolitan Boroughs Joint Standing Committee organised a competition for a superior one in 1923, but the results were disappointing. The Birmingham Civic Society then produced a design of its own—in reinforced concrete—but it was informed by the Director of Telephones that the design produced by the Office of the Engineer-in-Chief was preferred; as the Architects’ Journal commented, 'no one with any knowledge of design could <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> but indignation with the pattern that seems to satisfy the official mind.' The Birmingham Civic Society did not give up and, with additional pressure from the Royal Institute of British Architects, the Town Planning Institute and the Royal Academy, the Postmaster General was forced to think again; and the result was that the RFAC organised a limited competition.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Chandelier" [...] has a sad theme {{talking about}} [...] "the glitter and fatigue {{of a party}} girl's life". John Walker from MTV Buzzworthy opined that the song has a dark theme, [...] "toeing the line between celebration and self-destruction as it becomes {{increasingly}} more blurred". The song's opening lyrics, [...] "Party girls don't get hurt, can't <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> ... I push it down", are sung over a reggae-influenced background. Walker noted that during the chorus, Sia sings, [...] "I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier/ I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist, like it doesn't exist". A few critics compared the song's musical style to works done by Rihanna, including Jeremy Gordon from Pitchfork Media, and Melinda Newman of HitFix.|$|E

[...] Billboards David Greenwald praised the choreography and noted that Usher shows no signs of sickness as he performs the compound choreography, [...] "which ends with a forceful escape". Sam Lansky of Idolator was divided on the video and wrote that the singer [...] "could have dug a little deeper to tap into some of that very real personal pain to bring something more emotionally charged to this video; as it stands, it’s a little too polished to <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> but contrived." ...|$|E

500|$|Ferreira is {{primarily}} a synthpop singer, also being described as dance-pop, indie pop, indie rock, alternative rock, and art pop. Her earlier work incorporated elements of dance-pop and electropop, most notably seen in tracks from As If! and Ghost, this one also included elements of acoustic and new wave. Her lyrical content originally incorporated themes of rebellion and teenage romance; Andrew Unterberger from Popdust opined that [...] "17" [...] plays the girl-gone-wild tale as a near-horror story, clearly meant to shock and upset", while noting that [...] "One" [...] "instead features a robo'd out Sky bemoaning the breakdown of connection in a relationship, and her own inability to <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> as a result." [...] As her career progressed, Ferreira more frequently experimented with elements of indie rock, which were commonly heard in her first album Night Time, My Time.|$|E
500|$|... {{commonly}} called , is a fictional character {{and one of}} the protagonists in the Fullmetal Alchemist manga series and its adaptations created by Hiromu Arakawa. Alphonse is a child who lost his body during an alchemical experiment to bring his deceased mother back to life and had his soul attached to a suit of armor by his older brother Edward. As a result, Alphonse is almost invulnerable as long as the armor's seal is not erased, but is unable to <b>feel</b> <b>anything.</b> To recover their bodies, the Elrics travel around their country Amestris to obtain the Philosopher's Stonean alchemical object that could restore them. In the animated adaptations of Fullmetal Alchemist, Alphonse is voiced by Rie Kugimiya in Japanese. In the English adaptations, he is voiced by Aaron Dismuke in the first series and by Maxey Whitehead in the second.|$|E
500|$|Director Chris Buck {{believed}} that Menzel's vocals would {{help in the}} portrayal of the character, saying, [...] "Idina {{has a sense of}} vulnerability in her voice. She plays a very strong character, but someone who lives in fear—so we needed someone who could portray both sides of the character, and Idina was just amazing." [...] Menzel was unaccustomed to working with animated films and being required to portray her character's feelings with her voice alone, though she did not find it particularly challenging. While recording, she was able to [...] "play" [...] with her voice, trying various tones to establish the ranges in Elsa's emotions. For example, Menzel wanted there to be a difference between the ways she sounded when she was being bold and when she was angry. She would also physically restrict her hands from moving as she recorded the film's early scenes in order to project how her character was [...] "so afraid to move and <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> that it would come out and hurt people".|$|E

When first encountered she is a sixteen-year-old girl with silver hair and silver eyes who, it transpires, has been sixteen for thirty-five Discworld 'years' (no time passes in Death's Domain). During her encounter with Rincewind (see below), her behaviour is sufficiently flamboyant as to cause him to believe she is [...] "bonkers". When Mort first encountered Ysabell, he was given the impression of [...] "too many chocolates". She also has a fixation for the colour pink.|$|R

500|$|The 1950 playoffs were {{overshadowed by}} an on-ice mishap {{in the opening}} game between Toronto and Detroit, in which the Red Wings' young star player, Gordie Howe, was seriously injured. Late in the game with Toronto leading 4–0, Kennedy stole the puck from Detroit defenseman Jack Stewart and was {{carrying}} it down the left wing about six feet from the boards into the Detroit end of the rink. Stewart was pursuing him from behind and Howe was coming in fast from the side to try to cut him off. Kennedy saw Howe coming at the last moment, {{and was able to}} dodge Howe's check while passing the puck to Sid Smith, but Howe could not stop and crashed head-first into the boards, with Stewart falling on top of him. Howe sustained a concussion, facial fractures, and a lacerated right eyeball, and doctors had to perform emergency procedures on him at the hospital to save his life. Detroit coach Tommy Ivan and general manager Jack Adams accused Kennedy of deliberately butt-ending Howe. Kennedy had not been assessed a penalty on the play. After the game Kennedy said, [...] "I don't know how he got it. I avoided his check along the boards and didn't <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> hit me, although he may have struck my stick." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Grant starred {{opposite}} Drew Barrymore in {{a parody}} of pop culture and the music industry called Music and Lyrics. The Associated Press described it as [...] "a weird little hybrid of a romantic comedy that's simultaneously too fluffy and not whimsical enough." [...] Though he neither listens to music nor owns any CDs, Grant learned to sing, play the piano, dance (a few mannered steps) and studied the mannerisms of prominent musicians to prepare {{for his role as}} a has-been pop singer, based loosely on Andrew Ridgeley, the lesser-known member of 1980s pop duo Wham!. The Star-Ledger dismissed the performance, writing that [...] "paper dolls have more depth." [...] The film, with its revenues totalling $145million, allowed Grant to mock disposable pop stardom and fleeting celebrity through its washed-up lead character. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, [...] "Grant strikes precisely the right note with regard to Alex's career: He's too intelligent not to be a little embarrassed, but he's far too brazen to <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> like shame." [...] In 2009, Grant starred opposite Sarah Jessica Parker in the Marc Lawrence's romantic comedy Did You Hear About the Morgans?, which was a critical failure but was a box office success. He reunited with Lawrence again for a dramedy film The Rewrite, starring opposite Marisa Tomei. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews, while Grant's performance was praised by many critics. Director Quentin Tarantino has stated that the film is one of his favorites of the year and called Grant a [...] "perfect leading man." [...] In 2015, he had a supporting role as Alexander Waverly in Guy Ritchie's The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Entertainment Weekly described his performance as [...] "the only bit of fun" [...] in the film. Glenn Kenny of Rogerebert.com gave film a mixed review but stated that [...] "while it can’t be said that Hugh Grant saves the movie, his return to prominence in the last half-hour, after a plot-seeding-walk-on earlier in the movie, peps things up considerably." ...|$|E
500|$|Sam & Max Hit the Road {{received}} a favorable reception from the gaming industry's press, holding {{a rating of}} 84% on the review aggregator site GameRankings. Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World in 1994 liked it [...] "measurably less" [...] than Day of the Tentacle. He compared the latter to a Looney Tunes cartoon and the former to an underground comic book, observing that Sam & Maxs style of humor [...] "can all be funny, but only to a point ... its main characters are basically jerks" [...] and the story was unimportant [...] "even to them". Ardai cited the completely optional and disconnected minigames as [...] "contribut to the feeling that Sam & Max is more a computerized busybox ... than a unified, focused piece of fiction". He liked the graphics and simplified SCUMM interface, but concluded that [...] "the whole is rather less {{than the sum of}} its parts ... Sam & Max affords a couple of hours of somewhat similar amusement" [...] to Tentacle. Edge noted that [...] "with most adventure games, its hard to <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> for the character(s) you control", but stated that Sam & Max Hit the Road broke this mold by being [...] "genuinely funny" [...] and players would be [...] "experimenting more than... normally just to see what the madcap pair will get up to next." [...] The reviewer praised the game's graphics as [...] "beautifully detailed" [...] and the puzzles as [...] "intricate to solve", but noted that a number of the minigames were [...] "dismal". Joonas Linkola, writing for Adventure Gamers, echoed many of these comments, praising the cartoon-style graphics as [...] "appropriately cheesy" [...] and [...] "colorful". On the subject of the game's humor, Linkola noted that [...] "there are many visual jokes, but the backbone of the game is in its witty dialogue", and as such this gave the game a [...] "replayability value" [...] as players may pick up on jokes based on [...] "verbal acrobatics, on the use of polysyllabic words, old English and other such oddities" [...] that they missed the first time around. Linkola gave additional praise to the soundtrack and audio work, stating that the [...] "very fitting voices... adds to the comical duo's wisecracking attitude".|$|E

The movies make emotions look so strong and real, whereas when things really do happen to you, it's like watching television—you don't <b>feel</b> <b>anything.</b> Right when I was being shot and ever since, I knew that I was watching television.

50|$|Touch {{is also an}} {{important}} aspect of how blind or visually impaired people perceive the world. Touch gives immense amount of information in the persons immediate surrounding. <b>Feeling</b> <b>anything</b> with detail gives off information on shape, size, texture, temperature, and many other qualities. Touch also helps with communication; braille is a form of communication in which people use their fingers to feel elevated bumps on a surface and can understand what is meant to be interpreted. There are some issues and limitations with touch as not all objects are accessible to feel, which makes it difficult to perceive the actual object. Another limiting factor is that the learning process of identifying objects with touch is much slower than identifying objects with sight. This {{is due to the fact}} the object needs to be approached and carefully felt until a rough idea can be constructed in the brain.|$|R
5000|$|Matt Bjorke of Roughstock {{gave the}} {{extended}} play {{a rating of}} 4 out of 5, stating that [...] "Hip to My Heart" [...] was infectious, however {{the rest of the}} album doesn't <b>feel</b> like <b>anything</b> [...] "hip". He also said while not every song is going to hit, their talent is there to raise even the ‘lowest’ song up to something interesting and worthy of listening to.|$|R

This marks a major turning point in the Question's career as he thinks to himself that he didn't <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> and would kill again if needed.

2500|$|Touch or somatosensation (adjectival form: somatic), {{also called}} tactition [...] (adjectival form: tactile) or mechanoreception, is a {{perception}} resulting from activation of neural receptors, generally in the skin including hair follicles, {{but also in the}} tongue, throat, and mucosa. A variety of pressure receptors respond to variations in pressure (firm, brushing, sustained, etc.). The touch sense of itching caused by insect bites or allergies involves special itch-specific neurons in the skin and spinal cord. The loss or impairment of the ability to <b>feel</b> <b>anything</b> touched is called tactile anesthesia.
