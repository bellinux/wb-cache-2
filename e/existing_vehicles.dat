The deployment was to be synchronized with upgrades, reset, and divestiture of <b>existing</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Vehicles displaced by the IFV may then replace selected M113 family of vehicles such as command and control, medical evacuation, and mortar carrier, allowing the Army to begin divestiture of the M113 family of vehicles. Upgrades to existing Bradley and Stryker vehicles may have been considered as risk mitigation based on {{the rate at which}} the GCV was introduced.

500|$|Sinclair {{realised}} {{that his}} electric vehicle design {{could easily be}} adapted to meet the new legislation. As the [...] "electrically assisted pedal cycle" [...] category was so new, there were no <b>existing</b> <b>vehicles</b> on the market that would meet the standards prescribed by the new legislation.

2500|$|In 2007, the {{small-scale}} German manufacturer, Bitter, {{which specializes}} in rebodying <b>existing</b> <b>vehicles</b> for sale in Europe, resumed its operations by launching the [...] "Vero" [...] at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show. It was based on WM series Caprice (WM) sedans, {{believed to have been}} purchased directly from Holden thanks to Erich Bitter's friendship with Holden's former Peter Hannenberger. It featured extra luxury fittings and a revised exterior, and its production ended in 2012.|$|E
2500|$|During production, {{the type}} was {{gradually}} improved, which caused further delays. [...] From the 245th vehicle onwards an automatic starter was installed, engaged by a handle, {{as the original}} manual system did not allow for a sufficiently quick response to a changing battlefield situation. [...] Also it was decided the design was too poorly protected. [...] In response to the first use of British Mark I tanks on 15 September 1916, the Germans had begun to introduce anti-tank weapons and tactics. One of the measures taken by them was the issuing of the Kerngeschoss or [...] "K-bullet", a hardened steel core round capable of piercing the thin armour of tanks. To defeat it, from the 210th vehicle onwards the Schneider tank was fitted with extra 5.4mm thick armour plates on the sides and front with a space of four centimetres between the main armour and these appliqué plates. Even without the spaced armour, the front plates would have been immune against K-bullet fire {{from a distance of}} two hundred metres, because they were angled at 60°, providing an effective line-of-sight thickness of [...] During the spring of 1917 <b>existing</b> <b>vehicles</b> were uparmoured (creating a surblindé version) by the army workshop at Champlieu. Some of these, such as a vehicle with series number 61213, were fitted with additional armour plates on the vertical front surfaces, including an extra rectangular shield around the gun barrel. On 1 April 1917 of the 208 tanks available only about a hundred had been retrofitted. None of the older tanks had at this point yet received the new starter engine, this part of the improvement process would take {{until the end of the}} summer.|$|E
2500|$|To deploy tanks, it {{was first}} needed to train crews and create tank units. On 14 July 1916 Estienne started {{to set up a}} {{training}} base at the Fort du Trou-d'Enfer, a fortress at Marly-le-Roi, west of Paris. For reasons of secrecy this location was officially attached to the 81st Heavy Artillery Regiment, a depot unit. On 15 August the camp was formally established and quickly filled with recruits, most of them young volunteers from various French armies. [...] At Marly the crews received their first instruction consisting of the basics of maintenance and a lot of driver training with an emphasis on crossing trenches, avoiding shell craters and running down trees and walls. Because no actual Schneider vehicles were available at first, Holt tractors were used instead; later boiler plate training chassis were employed with the superstructure removed and replaced by a protective wooden frame. From the spring of 1917 onwards about seven vehicles were used for this goal. For unit training and live fire exercises, which required much larger manoeuvre grounds, on 30 August 1916 a camp was established at Cercottes. It received its first training vehicles on 17 November 1916. To get better acquainted with the mechanical side of the tanks, most crew members left Cercottes for a month to work as a trainee at the SOMUA factory. New vehicles would normally be first delivered at Cercottes. In 1917 the Cercottes base grew to a strength of about five thousand men, many of them sent there from units {{trying to get rid of}} undesirable elements, forcing the base command to reduce manpower by again removing them. On 28 September 1916 a large instruction centre was established at Champlieu, south of Compiègne. [...] This location, close to the frontline and officially part of the warzone, could serve for final training and sending out battle-ready units to those armies needing them. [...] The tank workshops were also located there, repairing and updating <b>existing</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The bases at Cercottes and Champlieu used about sixty-four tanks purely for training purposes, to limit the wear on the combat vehicles.|$|E

40|$|As {{automated}} vehicles currently do {{not provide}} sufficient feedback relating to the primary driving task, drivers have no assurance that an automated vehicle has understood and can cope with upcoming traffic situations [16]. To address this we conducted two user evaluations to investigate auditory displays in automated vehicles using different types of sound cues related to the primary driving sounds: acceleration, deceleration/braking, gear changing and indicating. Our first study compared earcons, speech and auditory icons with <b>existing</b> <b>vehicle</b> sounds. Our findings suggested that earcons were an effective alternative to <b>existing</b> <b>vehicle</b> sounds for presenting information related to the primary driving task.
