He points out that manipulationist and interventionist conceptions of causation, {{such as those of}} Woodward, have largely neglected the ‘passive’ causal efficacy of manipulations of parameters for responses to subsequent inputs. For example, a neuron tuned to ‘dog’ at one moment can be reparameterized to respond optimally to ‘cat’ in subsequent input by altering the chains of synaptic weights that <b>feed</b> <b>driving</b> input into that neuron.|$|E

Corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured. Some dolphins take this further with strand <b>feeding,</b> <b>driving</b> prey until they are stranded on mud banks, {{where they can be}} easily accessed. Dolphins have also been observed blowing bubbles to startle and separate individual fish from a bait ball.|$|R

40|$|Feed {{efficiency}} {{is currently a}} very popular topic among cattle producers and researchers. However, {{this is not a}} new concept. Researchers have been studying feed efficiency for 40 years. However, changing dynamics in agriculture have brought more feed efficiency research to the forefront. The combination of decreasing acres available for crop production, an increasing world population, increased utilization of grain for fuel, increased input costs (fuel, transportation, and fertilizer) and an increase in feed costs (grain and forage) are some of the key factors that highlight the changing dynamics of agriculture. Additionally, the recent drought in much of the United States has further reduced the available <b>feed</b> supply <b>driving</b> <b>feed</b> costs dramatically higher. Historically, feed costs have represented 50 - 70 % of the cost of production for beef enterprises. As corn prices approached and exceeded $ 7 per bushel, feed costs were nearly 80 % of the costs in many feedlot operations. In 2011, an improvement of 10 % in feed efficiency in the entire feedlot sector would reduce feed costs $ 1. 2 billion...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of decreasing acres available for crop production, an increasing world population, increased utilization of grain for fuel and increased input costs (fuel, transportation, and fertilizer) {{have resulted in}} limited feed supplies and higher feed costs. Additionally, the recent drought {{in much of the}} United States has further reduced the available <b>feed</b> supply <b>driving</b> <b>feed</b> costs dramatically higher. Historically, feed costs have represented 50 D 70 % of the cost of production for beef enterprises. This past year, the high prices for corn and hay have driven that percentage over 80 % for many operations. CowDcalf producers have been forced to investigate alternative feedstuffs to lower the cost of production. Ideally, the cowherd is grazing {{a significant portion of the}} year. Grazing days varies drastically throughout different regions of the United States and is greatly impacted by year to year differences in weather patterns. Drought limits summer grazing. Snow and ice can limit winter grazing. Harvested and stored feeds represent the majority of feed costs for cowDcalf producers. With hay supplies low and hay costs high, producers need to consider alternative feeds for winter feeding and for emergency drought relief...|$|R

When a transmitter {{is connected to}} an antenna by a <b>feed</b> line, the <b>driving</b> point impedance of the antenna must be resistive and matching the characteristic impedance of the feed line {{in order for the}} transmitter to see the impedance it was designed for (the impedance of the feed line, usually 50 or 75 ohms).|$|R

His sudden roar of pain and rage was smothered by a volley from the apes, who had seen Tarzan's act. Numa shook his massive head and glared upward at his tormentors. For a half hour they pursued him with rocks and broken branches, and though he dragged his kill into densest thickets, yet they always {{found a way to}} reach him with their missiles, giving him no opportunity to <b>feed,</b> and <b>driving</b> him on and on.|$|R
40|$|In {{the face}} of starvation, animals will engage in high-risk {{behaviors}} that would normally be considered maladaptive. Starving rodents, for example, will forage {{in areas that are}} more susceptible to predators and will also modulate aggressive behavior within a territory of limited or depleted nutrients. The neural basis of these adaptive behaviors likely involves circuits that link innate feeding, aggression and fear. Hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) -expressing neurons are critically important for <b>driving</b> <b>feeding</b> and project axons to brain regions implicated in aggression and fear. Using circuit-mapping techniques in mice, we define a disynaptic network originating from a subset of AgRP neurons that project to the medial nucleus of the amygdala and then to the principal bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which suppresses territorial aggression and reduces contextual fear. We propose that AgRP neurons serve as a master switch capable of coordinating behavioral decisions relative to internal state and environmental cues...|$|R
40|$|Collagen is {{the main}} protein {{component}} of the extracellular matrix of bone, and it has structural and instructive properties. Collagen undergoes many post-translational modifications, including extensive crosslinking. Although defective crosslinking has been implicated in human syndromes (e. g., osteogenesis imperfecta or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), {{it is not clear}} to what extent crosslinking is necessary for collagen's instructive properties during bone formation. Here we report that inhibition of collagen crosslinking in the mouse pre-osteoblast cell line MC 3 T 3 -E 1 impairs the osteogenic program. Genome-wide expression profiling of beta-aminopropionitrile-treated and control cells revealed that matrix deposition by MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells provides a <b>feed</b> back signal, <b>driving</b> cells through the differentiation process, that is strongly impaired when crosslinking is inhibited. Inhibition of crosslinking did not affect osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), shown by the expression of alkaline phosphatase and genome-wide gene expression analysis, although it enhances matrix mineralization. In conclusion, collagen crosslinking harbors instructive properties in MC 3 T 3 -E 1 differentiation but plays a more-passive role in differentiation of bone marrow-derived hMSCs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis reports how prototypes of micromachined vacuum sensors were designed, {{fabricated}} and characterized. The sensing {{mechanism of}} this vacuum sensor {{is based on}} the effect of squeeze film damping which is completely different from the existing vacuum sensors. Compared to other sensing mechanisms, the proposed mechanism could provide a better resolution at very low pressures due to the strong correlation between the squeeze-film damping and ambient pressure. When a resonator oscillates next to a fixed wall, the film of gas between the resonator and the fixed wall is squeezed {{in and out of the}} gap due to the interactions between the gas and the wall. As a result, a damping force, denoted as the squeeze-film damping, is applied to the resonator which dissipates its energy. The dissipated energy is obtained from the measured quality factor of a resonator. To correlate the measured quality factor with ambient pressure at low pressure level, a Monte Carlo simulation program was developed based on gas kinetic theory. This program tracks the motion of each individual molecule and calculates the energy and momentum exchange between the gas molecule and the wall during each collision. The program developed provides good agreement with some experimental results in the literature. Several prototypes were designed and preliminary modeling using analytical modeling and FEM simulation were carried out. These prototypes were then successfully fabricated using microfabrication technology. They were driven electrically using a biased driving scheme through an interface module. Oscillations of the resonator were observed under a microscope. A sensing circuit was also built to test the prototypes. The prototypes were placed inside a vacuum chamber and measurements at different pressure levels were conducted. By <b>feeding</b> the <b>driving</b> signal with different frequencies, the frequency responses of the prototype were found...|$|R
40|$|Cloud computing, social {{networking}} and information net-works (for search, news <b>feeds,</b> etc) are <b>driving</b> {{interest in the}} deployment of large data centers. TCP is the domi-nant Layer 3 transport protocol in these networks. How-ever, the operating conditions—very high bandwidth links, low round-trip times, small-buffered switches—and traffic patterns cause TCP to perform very poorly. The Data Cen-ter TCP (DCTCP) algorithm has recently been proposed as a TCP variant for data centers and addresses these short-comings. In this paper, we provide a mathematical analysis of DCTCP. We develop a fluid model of DCTCP {{and use it to}} analyze the throughput and delay performance of the algorithm, {{as a function of the}} design parameters and of network conditions like link speeds, round-trip times and the number of active flows. Unlike fluid model representations of standard con-gestion control loops, the DCTCP fluid model exhibits limit cycle behavior. Therefore, it is not amenable to analysis by linearization around a fixed point and we undertake a direct analysis of the limit cycles, proving their stability. Using a hybrid (continuous- and discrete-time) model, we analyze the convergence of DCTCP sources to their fair share, ob-taining an explicit characterization of the convergence rate. Finally, we investigate the “RTT-fairness ” of DCTCP; i. e., the rate obtained by DCTCP sources as a function of their RTTs. We find a very simple change to DCTCP which is suggested by the fluid model and which significantly im-proves DCTCP’s RTT-fairness. We corroborate our results with ns 2 simulations...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{identify}} the fundamental processes <b>driving</b> <b>feeding</b> and feedback in AGN we turn to local Seyfert galaxies and rely on a multi-wavelength approach. With the integral field unit OSIRIS and adaptive optics we characterize the nuclear stars and gas down to scales of 5 - 30 parsecs {{in a sample of}} 40 Seyfert galaxies with the Keck OSIRIS Nearby AGN (KONA) survey. The complex gas kinematics in these near-IR data are interpreted using an integrative approach through comparison with data available at a range of wavelengths. We present first results from the survey with a focus on work aimed at constraining the mechanism(s) driving inflow of material within the central 200 pc. Particularly useful in the identification of inflow mechanisms (e. g. nuclear spiral, external accretion) is spatial correlation of the molecular gas distribution and kinematics with dust features revealed in HST imaging (optical and near-IR). Also informative is comparison with X-ray emission to identify locations likely influenced by interactions with outflows. The stellar kinematics in the sample galaxies (traced by CO bandheads at 2. 3 microns) indicate a stellar population within the central few 100 parsecs in circular rotation, and in the majority of the galaxies the molecular gas (traced by H 2 emission at 2. 1218 microns) is found to have a rotating component co-spatial with the stellar disk. A significant fraction of the galaxies also exhibit kinematic signatures of inflow superimposed on this disk rotation, with inflow driven by secular and non-secular processes identified. We explore statistical trends of the nuclear stellar and molecular gas properties, including primary fueling mechanism, with Seyfert type, AGN luminosity, and host environment with the goal of disentangling which properties are fundamental {{to the nature of the}} AGN...|$|R
40|$|Lizard skulls {{vary greatly}} {{in shape and}} construction, and radical changes in skull form during {{evolution}} have made this an intriguing subject of research. The mechanics of feeding have surely been affected by this change in skull form, but whether this change in <b>feeding</b> is the <b>driving</b> force behind the change in skull shape is the underlying question being addressed throughout this project. Here the skull of 'Uromastyx hardwickii', an akinetic herbivorous lizard has been analysed using advanced computer modelling techniques. This study aimed to perform a multibody dynamics analysis (MDA) on a biting lizard skull so that bite forces, joint forces, ligament forces and muscle forces could be accurately predicted. Then, using this MDA load data stresses and strains within the skull were assessed using finite element analysis (FEA). These FE analyses {{were used to assess}} biting performance and to test hypotheses that consider biomechanical optimization of bone as the main reason behind the modification of skull shape during its evolution. Sutures were modelled and their effect on skull strains was assessed through a series of investigative studies. Finally, representative basal skull forms were examined to highlight potential implications of specific skull variations. To assist in validation of the computational modelling experimental strain gauging was conducted. The MDA provided detailed information on cranial biomechanics and associated cranial forces in this animal. It is believed that this technique will play a pivotal role in the analysis of skulls in the future and this study has demonstrated its definite potential. Cranial kinesis was seen to be mechanically significant in reducing joint reaction forces acting upon the skull, and specific groups of sutures (i. e. the frontal-parietal suture) in the Uromastyx skull played a substantial role in relieving strain compared to the other sutures, raising the questions about the original role of mesokinesis in squamate evolution.

40|$|Mid- and {{hind-gut}} lumenal {{changes are}} described in the free-living predatory soil mite Pergamasus longicornis (Berlese) from a time series of histological sections scored during and after feeding on fly larval prey. Three distinct types of tangible material {{are found in the}} lumen. Bayesian estimation of the change points in the states of the gut lumenal contents over time is made using a time-homogenous first order Markov model. Exponential processes within the gut exhibit ’stiff’ dynamics. A lumen is present throughout the midgut from 5 min after the start of feeding as the gut rapidly expands. It peaks at about 21. 5 h - 1. 5 days and persists post-feeding (even when the gut is contracted) up until fasting/starvation commences 10 days post start of feeding. The disappearance of the lumen commences 144 h after the start of feeding. Complete disappearance of the gut lumen make take 5 - 9 weeks from feeding commencing. Clear watery prey material arrives up to 10 min from the start of <b>feeding</b> - <b>driving</b> gut lumen expansion. Intracellular digestion triggered by maximum gut expansion is indicated. Detectable granular prey material appears in the lumen during the concentrative phase of coxal droplet production and, despite a noticeable collapse around 12 h, lasts in part for 52. 5 h. Posterior midgut regions differ slightly from anterior regions in their main prey food dynamics being somewhat faster in processing yet being slightly delayed. Posterior regions are confirmed as Last-In-Last-Out depots, anterior regions confirmed as First-In-First-Out conveyor belt processes. Evidence for differential lability of prey fractions is found. A scheme of granular imbibed prey material being first initially rapidly absorbed (t andfrac 12; = 23 min), and also being quickly partly converted to globular material extra-corporeally/extracellularly (t andfrac 12; = 36 min) - which then rapidly disappears (t andfrac 12; = 1. 1 h, from a peak around 4 h) is presented. This is then followed by slow intracellular digestion (t andfrac 12; = 6. 9 h) of the resultant resistant prey residue matching the slow rate of appearance of opaque pre-excretory egestive refractive grains (overall t andfrac 12; = 4. 5 days). The latter confirmed latent ’catabolic fraction’ (along with Malpighian tubule produced guanine crystals) drives rectal vesicle expansion as ’faeces’ during the later phases of gut emptying/contraction. Catabolic half-lives are of the order of 6. 3 - 7. 8 h. Membraneous material is only present in the lumen of the gut in starving mites. No obvious peritrophic membrane was observed. The total feeding cycle time may be slightly over 52. 5 h. Full clearance in the gut system of a single meal including egestive and excretory products may take up to 3 weeks. Independent corroborative photographs are included and with posterior predictive densities confirm the physiological sequence of:- ingestion/digestion; egestion; excretion; defecation; together with their timings. Visually dark midguts almost certainly indicate egestive refractive grains (?xanthine) production. Nomograms to diagnose the feeding state of P. longicornis in field samples are presented and show that the timing of these 4 phases in the wild could be inferred by scoring 10 - 12 mites out of a sample of 20. Suggestions to critically confirm or refute the conclusions are included...|$|R
