When his maternal uncle, Dwarakanath Vidyabhusan, was ill in 1873, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> look after Somprakash, his school at Majilpur, and his property. During the period, he also took interest {{in the affairs of}} Harinavi Brahmo Samaj and Harinavi School. Harinavi was a village adjacent to Majilpur. He appointed his friend Prakash Chandra Roy as the second master of the school. In 1874, he took over as headmaster of South Suburban School. In 1876, he joined as head pundit of Hare School but gave up government service after a short period and devoted himself fully to the work of the Brahmo Samaj.|$|E

25|$|As {{the teams}} {{returned}} up the pavilion steps Sir Donald Bradman called Richie Benaud {{to one side}} and reminded him that England's only chance of retaining the Ashes was it they were forced to follow on and made a lot of runs. Benaud agreed with him, but excused himself as he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> tell Peter May {{that he was going to}} bat again. When he reached the dressing room he consoled May with what Sir Donald had said. This was repeated by cricket commentators when a Test side in this situation must win, notably when Allan Border's Australians followed on at The Oval in 1985. Watson (40) returned with Richardson (43) and together they saw off the new ball to end the day on 43/0, and produced the highest England opening stand of the series, staying for almost three hours and adding 89. Davidson could not bowl after his injury, Rorke opened the bowling with Lindwall and Benaud had to bowl himself for a spell of four hours. The partnership ended when Watson pulled a full toss from the captain and Les Favell ran in to take the catch on the boundary. Richardson fell to Benaud (4/84) padding up against a ball that didn't move having survived a l.b.w. appeal the ball before. May (59) and Graveney looked set for big scores, and the England captain struck Benaud for three successive fours before he was leg before by a torpedo from Rorke (2/78). Bailey was caught by Grout off Lindwall (2/70) on the last ball of the day, though he and Graveney thought the ball had come off the top of his pad. At 198/5 England's cause looked lost and Graveney could only look on as the lower order collapsed before him. Lock (9) stayed in for an hour as did Tyson, who made 33 in a stand of 46, but the other three tailenders only lasted 20 minutes and Graveney ended with 53 not out, having batted for over five hours. England's total of 270 put them only 34 runs ahead.|$|E

500|$|IGN's regular Fringe {{reviewer}} Ramsey Isler {{rated the}} episode 8/10. He compared the plot to Lost, remarking [...] "Apparently one thoroughly confusing and unnecessarily convoluted TV series wasn't enough... But hey, I understand why J.J. and his Fringe collaborators... {{might have done}} this. They had kind of written themselves into a corner {{where one of the}} universes <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> they couldn't stretch that storyline out forever. A restart like this {{is a good way to}} allow themselves room to write something new, even if it may require some clever thinking to explain themselves out of this situation adequately." [...] Isler had trouble rating the finale, noting that he had to see how the events are explained in the fourth season before he can make a complete judgment.|$|E

500|$|In January 2006, nine tracks {{recorded}} for the album were {{leaked to the}} Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated [...] "I would say it {{did it in a}} good way 'cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing—and for the most part, the record tracks don't sound anything like the leaked demos." [...] However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, [...] "For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren't done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I {{was under the impression that}} those songs had been wasted or something—that we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren't, and I'm probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever." ...|$|E
500|$|Armitage {{believes}} {{that when it}} is Lucas's turn to leave the series, he would [...] "leave in style," [...] and has no preference how he would exit, whether [...] "sending Lucas to Manchester or severing his head," [...] he believes the producers would owe him a [...] "brilliant exit." [...] In an interview with Lorraine Kelly on GMTV on May 2010, Armitage revealed that in the ninth series, [...] " [...] is not who you thought he was. He's not who I thought he was." [...] He admitted to being surprised at the development while reading the script. With the series theme being [...] "deception", Armitage felt that playing another side of Lucas was [...] "interesting," [...] "quite exciting to play" [...] and like [...] "working in reverse because we've already established his background and then we've <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> establish a much deeper background." [...] Writers Jonathan Brackley and Sam Vincent (both head writers of the ninth series, having written five of the episodes) made the decision about Lucas' story-arc in the series during the initial meetings with the producers. Throughout {{the process of developing}} Lucas' arc, they worked through [...] "a bazillion different versions." [...] For example, in the series finale, they considered that Lucas would release the Albany weapon on the Grid. Both writers admitted that they were [...] "not-half" [...] concerned with possible negative reactions from fans of both Armitage and the character. In September 2011, co-star Peter Firth confirmed Lucas was killed off in the ninth series finale. He stated that the character [...] "was always going to die." [...] At some point the producers considered having Harry shoot him {{at the top of the}} building where he would fall to his death. However, this changed to have Lucas just jumping off the building instead.|$|E

Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant {{described}} the process: [...] "When {{they did the}} remix of 'So Hard', they didn't do a remix at all, they re-wrote the record ...

2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{findings}} of the inquiry into Wright's death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television's Live Tonight the UVF's mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, [...] "It was obvious he [...] was doing his own thing and going his own way. I think he had become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him {{to get out of the}} country – that's when the LVF was formed, that's when the breakaway group appeared." [...] When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, [...] "You have to be prepared to kill people if you tell them to do something and they don't do it – something of that magnitude. If you say they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> they don't go – the defiance alone, it doesn't leave many alternatives". McDonald expressed his personal belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright's death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.|$|E
2500|$|Martha Jones is {{introduced}} in the 2007 series of Doctor Who, first appearing in the episode [...] "Smith and Jones". When the hospital she works at is teleported to the Moon, medical student Martha helps save the day alongside an alien time traveller known only as the Doctor (David Tennant). To thank her for her help, the Doctor invites her to join him for a supposed single trip in his time machine the TARDIS, but later accepts her as his full-time [...] "companion", admitting that she was [...] "never just a passenger", and he even gives her {{the key to the}} TARDIS. Martha becomes frustrated because the Doctor is oblivious to her feelings for him, and she expresses concern that she is simply a rebound after the Doctor's painful loss of his previous companion, Rose (Billie Piper). When the amnesiac Doctor falls in love in the [...] "Human Nature"/"The Family of Blood" [...] two-parter, a pained Martha claims [...] "You <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> {{fall in love with a}} human... and it wasn't me". In the series finale, in which the Doctor's nemesis the Master (John Simm) takes over planet Earth, capturing both the Doctor and fellow companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), Martha manages to escape by teleporting away but is left alone to save the world. On the run from the Master, she spends a year travelling the world in a plan which restores the incapacitated Doctor and reverses time, undoing the Master's actions. Able to remember the events during the Master's reign, Martha then leaves the TARDIS of her own accord, telling the Doctor that she can't waste her life pining for someone when the relationship cannot happen, but promises that she will see him again. Martha, as voiced by Freema Agyeman, also appears in the 2007 animated serial The Infinite Quest, which aired in twelve weekly segments during the run of the 2007 series.|$|E
2500|$|Sorge {{arrived in}} Yokohama on 6 September 1933. After landing in Japan, Sorge became the Japan {{correspondent}} for the Frankfurter Zeitung. As the Frankfurter Zeitung was the most prestigious newspaper in Germany, Sorge's status as the Tokyo {{correspondent for the}} Frankfurter Zeitung made him {{in many ways the}} most senior German reporter in Japan. Sorge's reputation as a Nazi journalist who detested the Soviet Union served as an excellent [...] "cover" [...] for his espionage work. Sorge was told by his GRU superiors that his mission in Japan was to [...] "give very careful study {{to the question of whether}} or not Japan was planning to attack the USSR". After his arrest in 1941, Sorge told his captors: [...] "This was for many years the most important duty assigned to me and my group; it would not be far wrong to say that it was the sole object of my mission in Japan...The USSR, as it viewed the prominent role and attitude taken by the Japanese military in foreign policy after the Manchurian incident, had come to harbor a deeply implanted suspicion that Japan was planning to attack the Soviet Union, a suspicion so strong that my frequently expressed opinions to the contrary were not always fully appreciated in Moscow..." [...] He was warned by his commanders not to have contact with the underground Japanese Communist Party or with the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo. His intelligence network in Japan included Red Army officer and radio operator Max Clausen, Hotsumi Ozaki, and two other Comintern agents, Branko Vukelić, a journalist working for the French magazine, Vu, and a Japanese journalist, Miyagi Yotoku, who was employed by the English-language newspaper, the Japan Advertiser. Max Clausen's wife Anna acted as ring courier from time to time. From summer 1937, Clausen operated under cover of his business, M Clausen Shokai, suppliers of blueprint machinery and reproduction services. The business had been set up with Soviet funds but in time became a commercial success. Ozaki was a Japanese man from an very influential family who had grown up in Taiwan (at the time a Japanese colony) and was an idealistic Sinophile who believed that Japan, which had started its modernization with the Meiji Restoration, had much to teach China. However, the Sinophile Ozaki was shocked by the racism of Japanese policy towards China with the Chinese being depicted as a people fit only to be slaves. Ozaki believed that the existing political system of Japan with the emperor being worshipped as a living god <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> to save Japan from fascism required that Japan be [...] "reconstructed as a socialist state".|$|E
