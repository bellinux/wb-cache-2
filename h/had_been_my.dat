500|$|In 1943 the studio's film Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture. When {{the award}} was announced, {{producer}} Hal B. Wallis {{got up to}} accept, only to find Jack Warner had rushed onstage [...] "with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction" [...] to take the trophy, Wallis later recalled. [...] "I couldn't believe it was happening. Casablanca <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> creation; Jack {{had absolutely nothing to}} do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious.... Almost forty years later, I still haven't recovered from the shock." ...|$|E

Go home, get your England stuff ready, and I'll call first thing tomorrow...' Even though I was approximately the seventeenth choice, this was still fantastic news... After three disappointing Test appearances, this was my second chance, {{and the opportunity to}} set the record straight... the telephone finally rang. 'Got some bad news, I'm afraid,' David began. 'I couldn't persuade Ted Dexter or Mickey Stewart, so you're not in any more. They've gone for Alan Igglesden. Know anything about him?' With that, David must have known his influence as England captain was over – and indeed Graham Gooch succeeded him after that Test. I felt utterly devastated, and knew I would never play for England again, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> main motivating force. So when the Today newspaper offered me the post of cricket correspondent the following summer, it was an easy decision to make. I might have been only thirty, which was no age to retire from professional cricket, and I could easily have played for another five years. But it was definitely time to move on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1877, John Spencer-Churchill was {{appointed}} Viceroy of Ireland, with Randolph as his private secretary, {{resulting in the}} Churchill family's relocation to Dublin, a city in British-controlled Ireland. It was here that Jennie's second son, Jack, was born in 1880; there has been speculation that Randolph was not his biological father. Throughout much of the 1880s Randolph and Jennie were effectively estranged, during which she had many suitors. Churchill had virtually no relationship with his father; referring to his mother, Churchill later stated that [...] "I loved her dearly - but at a distance." [...] His relationship with Jack would be warm, and they were close at various points in their lives. In Dublin, he was educated in reading and mathematics by a governess, while {{he and his brother}} were cared for primarily by their nanny, Elizabeth Ann Everest; Churchill was devoted to her and nicknamed her [...] "Woomany". In My Early Life he wrote: [...] "She <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>my</b> dearest and most intimate friend during the whole of the twenty years I had lived." ...|$|E
