5|$|Geologically, Plymouth has {{a mixture}} of limestone, Devonian slate, granite and Middle Devonian limestone. Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs is a Site of Special Scientific <b>Interest,</b> <b>because</b> of its geology. The bulk {{of the city is}} built upon Upper Devonian slates and shales and the {{headlands}} at the entrance to Plymouth Sound are formed of Lower Devonian slates, which can withstand the power of the sea.|$|E
5|$|Like most fells in the Helvellyn range, Nethermost Pike has grassy western {{slopes and}} rocky {{outcrops}} {{on the eastern}} side. Geologically, Nethermost Pike belongs to the Borrowdale Volcanic Group. Lead was once mined on its eastern slopes, resulting in open workings and underground mines. The eastern slopes are protected {{as part of a}} Site of Special Scientific <b>Interest</b> <b>because</b> of the Pike's geological and biological features, which include some of England's best arctic-alpine and tall-herb vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium chalcogen and pnictogen {{compounds}} {{have been}} well studied primarily as part of research into their electronic and magnetic properties and their interactions in the natural environment. Pnictide and carbide compounds have also attracted <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> of {{their presence in the}} fuel of several advanced nuclear reactor designs, although the latter group has not had nearly as much research as the former.|$|E

5|$|The Manasollasa {{has been}} called an {{important}} source on socio-cultural history of medieval India, particularly {{for the history of}} food, drinks and cuisines and of sports. Mandakranta Bose, a professor on South Asian studies, describes the text to be of great <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> it is the earliest known text with details on dance genres in India. A team consisting of Bruno Nettl, a professor of music and anthropology, has called Manasollasa an enormous treatise with large sections on music, dance and other performance arts.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is of architectural <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> it still retains architectural elements from many previous centuries, including a 14th-century sacristy wall and 16th-century tower {{connected with the}} King's Council of the North. It {{is also one of}} only two intact 17th-century brick buildings that survive in the city, the other being Alderman Fenwick's House.|$|E
5|$|The match {{attracted}} considerable media <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> of {{the number}} of foreigners involved. It marked {{the first time that the}} two managers of opposing sides were born outside the British Isles, and it was anticipated the final would receive a large overseas audience because of the inclusion of several international players. Broadcast in 70 countries, viewing figures for the match totalled close to 600million.|$|E
50|$|The United States did {{not need}} a forward Propaganda Minister; it could count on big bands {{producing}} music that reflected the government's primary <b>interests</b> <b>because</b> those were {{the interests of the}} population.|$|R
50|$|Michael Bequith, a NeoShinto monk and aide to Dr. Laurent Herat, an {{exobiologist}} are commandeered by Rear Admiral Crisler of the Rights Economy {{to join a}} joint expedition back to the Envy. The RE is <b>interested,</b> <b>because</b> the Envy {{appears to}} be a multi-species vessel, something previously unheard of. They are also <b>interested</b> <b>because</b> writing on the craft is the script of an alien species, the Lasa, who have supposedly been extinct for the last two billion years. Rue and her crew are also returning, since under Compact law she can only complete her claim if she can control the Envy.|$|R

5|$|These are of {{particular}} <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> {{they are the first}} black holes discovered that were intermediate in mass between the conventional stellar-mass black hole and the supermassive black holes discovered at the cores of galaxies. The mass of these intermediate mass black holes is proportional to the mass of the clusters, following a pattern previously discovered between supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are of particular <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed instruments to any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the polar}} lipids, the outer layer of MFGM {{contains}} {{a number of}} glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins. Proteomic analysis has revealed at least 191 different known proteins in human MFGM, and comparable numbers in bovine milk protein concentrates. While quantitatively these only represent 1% to 2% of total milk protein content, MFGM proteins are of significant <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> many {{are known to have}} bioactive and potentially beneficial properties; almost half of identified proteins have membrane/protein trafficking or cell signaling functions. The glycosylated proteins, including mucins (MUC-1, MUC-4, MUC-15), butyrophilin, lactadherin, and CD36, have been suggested to enhance triacylglyceride digestion efficiency. Furthermore, lactadherin and MUC-1, in addition to the non-glycosylated protein xanthine oxidase, have been shown or suggested in preclinical studies to possess antimicrobial properties.|$|E

30|$|Polymer nanocapsules, the nanometer-sized hollow polymer spheres, have {{attracted}} {{more and more}} researching <b>interests</b> <b>because</b> of their fascinating potential applications such as drug delivery [1, 2], microreactors [3, 4], imaging [5], catalysts [6], and self-healing materials [7].|$|R
50|$|That same month, Sam Claflin {{joined the}} cast, stating he was <b>interested</b> <b>because</b> Philip was an ordinary, {{immature}} character, who was virginal until discovering Rachel. In February 2016, Holliday Grainger joined the cast, followed by Iain Glen in March.|$|R
5|$|Critics of the ESRB have {{asserted}} that the organization has a conflict of <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> of its {{vested interest in the}} video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued that, at the same time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.|$|E
5|$|Diffused {{lighting}} camouflage {{was a form}} {{of active}} camouflage using counter-illumination to enable a ship to match its background, the night sky, prototyped by the Royal Canadian Navy on corvettes during World War II. The principle was discovered by a Canadian professor, Edmund Godfrey Burr, in 1940. It attracted <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> it could help to hide ships from submarines in the ongoing Battle of the Atlantic, and the research project began early in 1941. The Royal Navy and the US Navy carried out further equipment development and trials between 1941 and 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 {{the company}} moved its Cardiff venue to the Sophia Gardens Pavilion (built for the Festival of Britain), with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra as the company's orchestra, {{replacing}} the previous ad hoc ensemble. The Pavilion was acoustically mediocre and lacked an orchestra pit; {{two years later}} the company moved again, to the New Theatre where it played Cardiff seasons across the next fifty years. The 1952 season attracted particular <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> it included {{what was then a}} rarity: Verdi's Nabucco. The company built a reputation for staging seldom-seen Verdi works, including The Sicilian Vespers staged in the same year, I Lombardi in 1956, and The Battle of Legnano, under the shortened title The Battle, in 1960. The 1952 Nabucco was the WNO's first production for which costumes and scenery were specially designed (by Patrick Robertson) rather than hired.|$|E

5|$|Serpins {{are also}} {{expressed}} by viruses {{as a way}} to evade the host's immune defense. In particular, serpins expressed by pox viruses, including cow pox (vaccinia) and rabbit pox (myxoma), are of <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> of their potential use as novel therapeutics for immune and inflammatory disorders as well as transplant therapy. Serp1 suppresses the TLR-mediated innate immune response and allows indefinite cardiac allograft survival in rats. Crma and Serp2 are both cross-class inhibitors and target both serine (granzyme B; albeit weakly) and cysteine proteases (caspase1 and caspase8). In comparison to their mammalian counterparts, viral serpins contain significant deletions of elements of secondary structure. Specifically, crmA lacks the D-helix as well as significant portions of the A- and E-helices.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of uranium {{was the focus}} of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various uranium oxides and uranium hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic uranium, but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery depleted uranium metal from the uranium tetrafluoride left over from the electromagnetic isotope separation process and uranium hexafluoride left over from the gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Vocalizations made {{by right}} whales are not {{elaborate}} {{compared to those}} made by other whale species. The whales make groans, pops and belches typically at frequencies around 500Hz. The purpose of the sounds is not known but may {{be a form of}} communication between whales within the same group. Northern right whales responded to sounds similar to police sirens—sounds of much higher frequency than their own. On hearing the sounds, they moved rapidly to the surface. The research was of particular <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> northern rights ignore most sounds, including those of approaching boats. Researchers speculate this information may be useful in attempts {{to reduce the number of}} ship-whale collisions or to encourage the whales to surface for ease of harvesting.|$|E
50|$|Hawkins was {{a highly}} touted prospect, and had {{official}} offers from Colorado, Boise State, Brigham Young, Oregon, and Louisiana-Lafayette, but only made official visits to Boise State and Colorado.

50|$|The {{new order}} was in Stalin's <b>interests,</b> <b>because</b> it enabled the Soviet Communists to present {{themselves}} as the primary maintainer of Poland's new western border.

5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of <b>interest.</b> <b>Because</b> they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E
5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of <b>interest</b> <b>because</b> they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{consists of}} {{the valley of the}} River Chew and is generally low-lying and undulating. It is bounded by higher ground ranging from Dundry Down to the north, the Lulsgate Plateau to the west, the Mendip Hills to the south and the Hinton Blewett, Marksbury and Newton St Loe plateau areas to the east. The valley's boundary generally follows the top of scarp slopes except at the southwestern and southeastern boundaries where flat upper areas of the Chew Valley grade gently into the Yeo Valley and eastern Mendip Hills respectively. The River Chew was dammed in the 1950s to create Chew Valley Lake, which provides drinking water for the nearby city of Bristol and surrounding areas. The lake is a prominent landscape feature of the valley, a focus for recreation, and is internationally recognised for its nature conservation <b>interest,</b> <b>because</b> of the bird species, plants and insects.|$|E
50|$|The Supreme Court {{decided the}} appeal in 1877.
