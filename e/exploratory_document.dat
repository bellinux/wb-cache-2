40|$|Abstract This is an <b>exploratory</b> <b>document</b> {{for a new}} {{research}} line in logical semantics which is emerging from several current developments in computer science. Standard logic employs 'flat' unstructured sets of statements for its theories and unstructured classes of models for its semantic universes. Nowadays, however, there is an incipient literature on structured universes of models as well as structured theories, both employing 'preference relations' of some sort. The purpose of this brief report is (1) to propose a more systematic framework for this trend, while also connecting it up with some historical predecessors, (2) to design some new logical systems bringing preferences out explicitly, thereby high-lighting the theoretical properties of 'preferential reasoning' while raising some new kinds of technical question for further research, and (3) to link up with some current computational ideas (emerging also {{in the field of}} linguistics), by bringing in the general dynamic logic o [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Knowledge work in many fields {{requires}} examining {{several aspects}} {{of a collection of}} documents to attain meaningful understanding that is not explicitly available. Despite recent advances in document corpus visualization research, there is still a lack of principled approaches which enable the users to personalize the exploratory analysis process. In this paper, we present IVEA (Information Visualization for <b>Exploratory</b> <b>Document</b> Collection Analysis), an innovative visualization tool which employs the PIMO (Personal Information Model) ontology to provide the knowledge workers with an interactive interface allowing them to browse for information in a personalized manner. Not only does the tool allow the users to integrate their interests into the exploration and analysis of a document collection, it also enables them to incrementally enrich their PIMO ontologies with new entities matching their evolving interests in the process, and thus benefiting the users not only in their future experiences with IVEA but also with other PIMO-based applications. The usability of the tool was preliminarily evaluated and the results were sufficiently encouraging to make it worthwhile to conduct a larger-scale usability study...|$|E
40|$|Enrique Peña Nieto, Mexico's current president, voiced {{strong support}} for {{extending}} the social mission of INFONAVIT [...] the largest mortgage lender in Mexico [...] to embrace quality of life metrics. He also indicated {{a strong interest in}} expanding housing opportunities to segments of the population who are currently not being served by the housing funds and banks {{to the extent that the}} right to a dignified home is enshrined in Mexico's Constitution. In order to continue giving greater importance to quality of life metrics and not just lending volumes, INFONAVIT strategy will focus on the creation of cities that are more efficiently organized and less segregated in an unprecedented effort to move towards an inclusive, prosperous Mexico on the basis of orderly and sustainable urban development. INFONAVITs 2013 - 2022 financial plan projected cash flow growth of 8. 82 % CAGR and its strategic agenda focused on four dimensions: i) Housing needs: providing funding and housing solutions that enhance the welfare of workers; ii) Social balance: ensuring housing quality and sustainability and promoting urban planning with a focus on employment growth; iii) Scope of policies: expanding connections with other housing institutions and aligning programs and policies with strategic sector guidelines; and iv) Risk & Return: sustaining strong financial and operational performance. The process of urban development is incremental for low-income households in Mexico since a significant percentage of the population has no possibility of living in dwellings constructed by the formal sector. Mexico is currently facing significant challenges in its future housing requirements. Specifically, this thesis will focus on three different proposals that complement the vision of President Enrique Peña Nieto and that could enhance the affordable housing sector in Mexico in order to create a better future for local residents. The proposals are: i) the creation of affordable Mexican edge cities, ii) the exploration of the Section 8 tenant-based housing voucher program practiced in the United States, and iii) the use of housing development as a regional development tool coupled with an industrial policy to rescue the Mexican southern region from deep-rooted stagnation and to potentiate the multiplier effect on the economy. Housing is a strategic sector for the economic growth and social development of Mexico since it triggers investment, creates jobs, strengthens the local market, and improves the quality of life of Mexican families. In order to analyze these proposals, this thesis reviews multiple reports from the Mexican government, industry, and academia. This is an <b>exploratory</b> <b>document</b> that will aim to provide useful information to policy makers in Mexico. by Alba Medina Flores. Thesis: S.

The answer to this question is almost always clear and unambiguous, but not always. Intersex/DSD is an umbrella term used to describe various congenital conditions in which the development of sex differs from what medical professionals generally understand to be ‘male’ or ‘female’. The differences may be chromosomal, gonadal or anatomical. There is growing international political attention for the position of people with intersex/DSD.

No group differences were seen in pre-chase behaviors other than those related to the hidden escape route, or in stress-related behaviors while being chased. EC rats escaped significantly more quickly than IC rats, and a composite. score derived from pre-challenge behavior in the arena was correlated significantly with escape time under challenge. In the second experiment, EC and IC subjects were chased without previous experience in the area; EC rats escaped significantly more quickly than IC rats. In an analysis of the combined results from the two experiments, both environmental history and pre-challenge arena experience were found to exert significant influence on escape time.

40|$|Retrieval of {{document}} fragments has a {{great potential}} for application in engineering information management. Frequently engineers have neither the time nor inclination to sift through long documents for small pieces of useful information. Yet it is frequently {{in the form of}} one or more long documents that the information that they seek is presented. Supporting the delivery of the right information, in the right for-mat and in the right quantity motivates the search for better ways of handling document sub-components or fragments. Document fragment retrieval can be facilitated using modern computational technologies. This paper proposes a novel framework for information access utilising state-of-the-art computational technologies and introducing the use of multiple document structure views through decomposition schemes. The framework integrates document structure study, mark-up technologies, automated fragment extraction, faceted classification and a document navigation mechanism to achieve the target of retrieval of specific document fragments using precise. complex queries. These disparate elements have been brought together in an <b>exploratory</b> Engineering <b>Document</b> Content Management System (EDCMS). Using this, investigations using representative engineering documents have shown that information users can access and retrieve document content - at fragment level rather than at document level - both through data in a document and document metadata, through different perspectives and at different granularities, and simultaneously across multiple documents as well as within a single document.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{challenges}} of archiving and organizing digital media, in particular video, as part of everyday life. Through mapping of related research work, products and phenomena, the current paradigms of development in media archiving and organizing are identified. By means of a <b>documented,</b> <b>exploratory</b> field study into the homes and physical video collections of six individuals, {{it is observed that}} people organize and archive their physical media archive primarily through placing videos in environments and locations with specific functions and secondly, through reorganizing the media when they use it.

As an outcome of the knowledge and understanding created in this design research project, the practice of informal archiving is identified.

Average total costs incurred per episode of VL were above the median annual per capita income, and six of the seven affected households either had to sell part of their livestock or to take a loan to cover the costs.
