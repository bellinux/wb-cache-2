5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; as soon as <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed, the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
25|$|The post of a farba {{was very}} prestigious, and his {{descendants}} could inherit {{it with the}} mansas approval. The mansa could also replace a farba if <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> control, {{as in the case}} of Diafunu.|$|E
25|$|Swift {{arrived home}} soon after Larson and Lee's invasion; <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his car, {{went into the}} house to investigate, confronted the two, and was shot in the heart and in the thigh. He died almost {{immediately}} from his wounds. His body was not moved until nearly 6pm that afternoon.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{landing on}} the beach in Nahariya, the group {{followed}} instructions issued in Beirut – which included finding a police officer and killing him. They knocked on the door of a private house and called out in Arabic via the intercom, frightening the residents into calling the police. Then, they killed responding police officer Eliyahu Shahar. According to the Israeli security services' reconstruction of the incident, Shahar was killed after <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his vehicle and fired two warning shots into the air. Kuntar's group responded with a massive burst of gunfire. Samir Kuntar boasted that he alone shot 30 bullets in this incident.|$|E
25|$|Bud Moore Engineering took {{a three-year}} hiatus until 1972, when David Pearson piloted the No. 15 Ford to a 26th-place finish at Riverside. LeeRoy Yarbrough, Dick Brooks, and Donnie Allison also drove that year. In 1973, Bobby Isaac climbed {{on board with}} Sta-Power Industries sponsoring. Isaac had six top-ten {{finishes}} until the Talladega 500, when he radioed in to Moore {{and told him he}} was quitting. When <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car, Isaac announced he was retiring. Some reports surfaced saying Isaac quit because voices in his head had told him to. His replacement was an unpolished rookie named Darrell Waltrip, who had a top-ten at Darlington Raceway.|$|E
25|$|By late Saturday afternoon, {{concerns}} were rising about driver safety on the track. Patrick Carpentier {{went to the}} medical facility to have his wrist checked (a previous injury he had suffered in a crash at Long Beach.) As an aside, he mentioned {{that he could not}} walk in a straight line for at least four minutes after <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his car. An impromptu survey was taken during the private drivers' meeting and 21 of the 25 drivers in the starting field reported suffering disorientation and vertigo-like symptoms, including inner ear, or vision problems, after running more than 10 laps (or 20 laps). They also claimed that they had had virtually no peripheral vision and limited reaction time. This was due to sustained g-loads as high as 5.5--almost double what most persons can endure, and closer to what jet pilots usually experience in shorter time intervals.|$|E
60|$|It was {{the same}} thing over again: <b>he</b> <b>got</b> nothing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> us, and we were remanded; our {{resolute}} behaviour annoying him prodigiously.|$|R

25|$|As Bryant {{drove down}} to Seascape, he shot at a red Ford Falcon coming the other way, smashing its front windscreen. Upon {{arriving}} at Seascape, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his car. A Holden Frontera 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and actually slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable. He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm. The car was going downhill so {{it was able to}} roll down the road out of sight around a corner. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.|$|E
25|$|At 1:08p.m. PDT, {{approximately}} {{seven hours}} after the rapes, Mixon's burgundy 1995 Buick sedan was pulled over by two motorcycle officers, Officer John Hege and Sergeant Mark Dunakin, for a traffic violation, in the 7400 block of MacArthur Boulevard in East Oakland, one block away from Eastmont Town Center and an Oakland Police Department substation. After collecting Mixon's driver's license, Sergeant Dunakin became suspicious that the license was fake and signaled to his partner, Officer Hege, to arrest Mixon. Mixon accessed a semiautomatic pistol, leaned out of the vehicle's side window, and opened fire without warning, methodically shooting both officers twice. After the officers collapsed to the ground, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle, approached them, and fired execution-style directly into their backs. He then briefly remained standing over the bodies before fleeing on foot. Those who heard the gunshots reported Mixon as having fired six shots. Neither officer was able to return fire. Mixon was last seen fleeing westward into the surrounding neighborhood on 74th Avenue southbound.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Rosberg recorded the fastest {{time of the}} day with a lap of one minute and 12.123 seconds; teammate Hamilton was second-fastest having set the fastest second sector time of any other driver and Räikkönen was third. Ricciardo was fourth-fastest, ahead of Williams drivers Bottas and Massa. Alonso, Kvyat, Vettel and Magnussen followed in the top ten. The session was disrupted three times: firstly for Vergne who stopped on track at turn four when his engine had a sudden loss of power after 11 minutes. The second stoppage was caused by Alonso when his engine caught fire and stopped on the straight between turns three and four. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his Ferrari, ran behind a barrier, and took a fire extinguisher to stop the blaze before marshals could reach his car. Gutiérrez triggered the final red flag period when his car stopped with an energy recovery system failure with thirteen minutes remaining. The final practice session was held in dry but overcast weather conditions and saw Rosberg complete a free practice sweep with the fastest time of one minute and 10.446 seconds on soft compound tyres. Hamilton was second-fastest and locked his tyres and spun while braking for the Senna S chicane. He was later delayed by a Lotus car while on a fast lap. The two Williams drivers were third and fourth (with Massa ahead of Bottas); Ricciardo was fifth and Button sixth. Räikkönen was seventh-fastest, Alonso eighth, Magnussen ninth and Kvyat rounded out the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, Senna's {{determination}} to win {{manifested itself in}} dismay at McLaren's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering FW14B car. McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings. A delay occurred in getting the new model running (it debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) {{and in addition to}} lacking active suspension, the new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while its Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit. During practice for the second race of the season in Mexico on a circuit Senna was heavily critical of, his car hit a bump that caused a loss of downforce and hard crash into a concrete retaining wall. He had to be extricated from the car by circuit doctors; although he raced the next day, albeit retiring from the race due to gearbox failure. Senna scored wins in Monaco, Hungary, and Italy that year. During qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, French driver Érik Comas crashed heavily and Senna was the first to arrive at the scene. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his car and ran across the track to help the Frenchman, disregarding his own safety in an effort to aid a fellow driver. He later went to visit Comas in the hospital. His actions won universal praise from those in Formula One and seemed to soften his hard-nosed image. Senna finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, and Benetton's Michael Schumacher.|$|E
500|$|The Jets {{had high}} hopes for 1999, but {{suffered}} a blow in the season opener when Testaverde ruptured his Achilles tendon and was lost for the season. New York suffered other injuries and fell to a 2–6 record before recovering to finish 8–8. Two days {{after the end of}} the season, Parcells announced his resignation as coach; he remained with the team for a year as chief of football operations. Belichick was slated to become head coach in Parcells' place, but one day later, he announced his own resignation. [...] Robert Kraft had gotten word to Belichick through intermediaries that he could have complete control of football operations and a $2 million salary if <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his contract with the Jets. After a lawsuit to void Belichick's contract failed and Tagliabue refused to release him, the Jets and Patriots agreed on draft choice compensation for the Jets.|$|E
500|$|Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon and {{frontman}} Pete Shelley {{have both}} been credited with suggesting the band name [...] "Stiff Kittens", but settled on [...] "Warsaw" [...] shortly before their first gig, referencing David Bowie's song [...] "Warszawa". Warsaw debuted on 29 May 1977 at the Electric Circus, supporting the Buzzcocks, Penetration and John Cooper Clarke. They received immediate national exposure due to reviews of the gig in the NME by Paul Morley and in Sounds by Ian Wood. Tony Tabac played drums that night after joining the band two days earlier. Mason was soon made the band's manager and Tabac was replaced on drums in June 1977 by Steve Brotherdale, who also played in the punk band Panik. During his tenure with Warsaw, Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to leave the band and join Panik and even got Curtis to audition for the band. In July 1977, Warsaw recorded a set of five demo tracks at Pennine Sound Studios, Oldham. Uneasy with Brotherdale's aggressive personality, the band fired him soon after the demo sessions. Driving home from the studio, they pulled over and asked Brotherdale to check on a flat tyre; when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the car, they sped off.|$|E
