I'll take a walk occasionally, and have a drink with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's afraid of what somebody else might do {{as a result of his}} work? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>hate</b> to see censorship come in, whether from the government or, from my point of view, personal." ...|$|E

[...] In a Rolling Stone interview, Stephens said that the May 2010 tribute {{performance}} would be the group's final show as Big Star, although not his last show with Auer and Stringfellow, stating, [...] "I can't see us going out as Big Star... But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>hate</b> to compound the loss of Alex by saying,'That's it' for Ken and Jon, too. I can't imagine not playing with them.

500|$|Despite his folkloric qualities, the Slender Man {{is not in}} {{the public}} domain. Several for-profit ventures {{involving}} the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this option holder has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright {{has less to do with}} money than with artistic integrity: [...] "I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>hate</b> for something to come out and just be kinda conventional." [...] As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment.|$|E
500|$|The band made {{an attempt}} to begin writing for a {{follow-up}} and had written and began recording one song titled [...] "Circle of the Noose", {{but it was never}} completed or officially released. The song, which is the last to feature guitar work from Navarro prior to his departure, was a tribute to the late qawwali-devotional singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Navarro described the song as totally pop, dirge-like and said the song was one of the favorite songs he had done with the band. He said [...] "The best way I can describe it is it's like pepped- up '60s folk with '90s ideals, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>hate</b> to label it as folk because it's not, it moves." [...] On June 7, 2011, Navarro was asked by a Chili Peppers fan on his blog about [...] "Circle of the Noose" [...] and said he didn't have the recordings but would love to hear them. Flea was also asked in 2011 through his Twitter page about the song and was shocked that anyone knew about it. He responded by saying [...] "Holy cow! how in the hell do you know about that? It had a sample of nusrat fateh Ali khan in it...never was finished". On February 3, 2016, a rough mix of [...] "Circle of the Noose", which had been recorded on March 16, 1998, was leaked to the internet. Dave Navarro tweeted [...] "WOW what a trip down memory lane" [...] in response to the leak.|$|E

60|$|It {{is painful}} {{to recall that}} secret dark chapter of my life--that period of moral insanity. But I wish {{not to be a}} hypocrite, {{conscious}} or unconscious, to delude myself or another with this plea of insanity. My mind was very clear just then; past and present were clear to me; the future clearest of all: I could measure the extent of my action and speculate on its future effect, and my sense of right or wrong--of individual responsibility--was more vivid than at any other period of my life. Can I even say that I was blinded by passion? Driven, perhaps, but certainly not blinded. For no reaction, or submission, had followed on that furious revolt against the unknown being, personal or not, that is behind nature, in whose existence I believed. I was still in revolt: <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>hate</b> Him, and show my hatred by being like Him, as He appears to us reflected in that mirror of Nature. Had He given me good gifts--the {{sense of right and wrong}} and sweet humanity? The beautiful sacred flower He had caused to grow in me I would crush ruthlessly; its beauty and fragrance and grace would be dead for ever; there was nothing evil, nothing cruel and contrary to my nature, that I would not be guilty of, glorying in my guilt. This was not the temper of a few days: I remained for close upon two months at Managa's village, never repenting nor desisting in my efforts to induce the Indians to join me in that most barbarous adventure on which my heart was set.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the rise}} to power of Cecil Rhodes, Borckenhagen quickly {{became aware of the}} pivotal {{importance}} of this arch-imperialist in the future of southern Africa. Making an estimation of the level of Rhodes's personal ambition and keen to neutralise an impending wave of imperialism, Borckenhagen met Rhodes and attempted to divert him to the republican cause, using the temptation of power. Having successfully influenced Rhodes to desire a united South Africa by offering him its leadership, he finally failed to persuade Rhodes to support complete independence for South Africa. He famously confronted Rhodes in Cape Town, in an oft-quoted interview, of which several conflicting versions exist. Borckenhagen reportedly accused Rhodes of [...] "crass materialism", a reverence for money, and the intention of forcefully bringing the republics into the British Empire. Rhodes reported that, in response to Borckenhagen's insistence that any union of South Africa would need to be independent, he had replied: [...] "No, you take me either for a rogue or a fool. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be a rogue to forget all my history and traditions; and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be a fool, because <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be <b>hated</b> by my own countrymen and mistrusted by yours." ...|$|R
