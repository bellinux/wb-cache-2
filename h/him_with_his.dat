5|$|The healing {{attributions}} of Eshmun were combined with his divine consort Astarte's fertilizing powers; the latter had an annex chapel with a sacred paved pool within the Eshmun sanctuary.

There is evidence that from the 3rd century BC onwards there have been attempts to Hellenize the cult of Eshmun and to associate <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> Greek counterpart Asclepius, but the sanctuary retained its curative function.|$|E

5|$|After {{visiting the}} village of Annisa to see his dying sister Macrina, he {{returned}} to Nyssa in August. In 380 he travelled to Sebaste, {{in the province of}} Armenia Prima, to support a pro-Nicene candidate for the election to the bishopric. To his surprise, he himself was elected to the seat, perhaps due to the population's association of <b>him</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> brother. However, Gregory deeply disliked the relatively unhellenized society of Armenia, and he was confronted by an investigation into his orthodoxy by local opponents of the Nicene theology. After a stay of several months, a substitute was found - possibly Gregory's brother Peter, who was bishop of Sebaste from 381 - and Gregory returned home to Nyssa to write books I and II of Against Eunomius.|$|E
