40|$|Crystal polymorphism, where a {{molecule}} forms several different crystal lattices, is common, and often {{needs to be}} controlled. For example, crystalline drugs must be manufactured as one specified polymorph, so polymorph purity {{is essential to the}} pharmaceutical industry. This thesis is a quantitative study of the crystallization of glycine from aqueous solution, which focuses particularly on polymorphism. Crystallization is observed within a 96 -well microplate, where each well is filled with 0. 1 mL of supersaturated solution. We address the difficulty of obtaining reproducible nucleation data. This problem is difficult because induction times are extremely sensitive to factors such as how the crystallizing system is prepared, and small variations in the supersaturation. The appropriate statistical tests needed to show reproducibility are discussed. Glycine has two common polymorphs, alpha and gamma, the competition between these polymorphs is studied. We obtain data at multiple NaCl concentrations. Addition of NaCl is known to favour nucleation of the gamma polymorph. The polymorph of crystals are individually identified in-situ using Raman spectroscopy. At high salt concentrations, nucleation kinetics of the alpha and gamma polymorphs are qualitatively different. The gamma polymorph behaves like the hare in Aesop's story of the tortoise and the hare: Nucleation start off rapidly, but slows, while for the alpha polymorph, nucleation starts off slow but at later times almost overtakes that of the gamma polymorph. The opposite time dependencies of the nucleation of the competing polymorphs, allows optimisation of polymorph purity using time-dependent supersaturation. Growth of the two polymorphs is analysed. The alpha polymorph is observed to grow faster than the gamma polymorph. Growth rates were variable, so they were also analysed in relation to induction times and crystal habits. We show that crystals with long induction times tend to be <b>needle-like,</b> and <b>needle-like</b> <b>morphologies</b> tend to grow faster than non <b>needle-like</b> <b>morphologies...</b>|$|R

Polymorph stability {{is known to be}} susceptible to solvent environment, and it is established that 1 -propanol stabilizes the most metastable form I. This study examines the effect of a range of alcohols on polymorph selection and attempts to elucidate the mechanism. The role of the alcohol functional group in the polymorph selection process is thus investigated and evaluated. Crystals were characterized using optical microscopy, SEM, PXRD, DSC, IR, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction for their polymorphic identity. The role of solvent in the stabilization of polymorphs was investigated by visualizing and calculating energy requirements for the interaction of each solvent molecule with α- and β-dimers of sulphathiazole, using Cerius 2 modeling software and GRID based systematic search simulation. These studies showed that solvent {{had a significant impact on}} polymorph selection. In common with 1 -propanol, 1 -butanol was found to stabilize form I by inhibiting the formation of the β-dimer, which is necessary for nucleation of and transformation to forms II-IV. Shorter chain alcohols and branched chain alcohols such as methanol, 2 -propanol, and ethanol did not stabilize form I but stabilized forms II, III, and IV, respectively, showing that it is not only the alcohol functionality but also the steric effects of the alkyl chain that contributed to the effect. Sulphathiazole form I normally has a needlelike morphology. Form I with a modified rodlike morphology was produced by crystallization from 1 -propanol with the addition of methanol in low concentration, showing that it is possible to control the morphology and selectively isolate polymorphs.

Each polymorph has a <b>needle-like</b> <b>morphology,</b> which can give preferred orientation effects when analysed by X-ray powder diffractometry (XRPD) thus providing difficulties for quantitative XRPD assessments. The occurrence of preferred orientation may be demonstrated by sample rotation {{and the consequent}} effects on X-ray data can be minimised by reducing the particle size. Using two particle size ranges (< 125 and 125 ¿ 500 ¿m), binary mixtures of beta and delta mannitol were prepared and the delta component was quantified. Samples were assayed in either a static or rotating sampling accessory. Rotation and reducing the particle size range to < 125 ¿m halved the limits of detection and quantitation to 1 and 3. 6 %, respectively. Numerous potential sources of assay errors were investigated; sample packing and mixing errors contributed the greatest source of variation. However, the rotation of samples for both particle size ranges reduced the majority of assay errors examined. This study shows that coupling sample rotation with a particle size reduction minimises preferred orientation effects on assay accuracy, allowing discrimination of two very similar polymorphs at around the 1 % level...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe thermal {{decomposition}} of uranyl peroxide tetrahydrate, (UO 2) O 2 (H 2 O) 2 · 2 H 2 O, was studied by combining high temperature powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermal analyses and spectroscopic techniques (Raman, IR and 1 H NMR). In situ analyses reveal that intermediates and final uranium oxides obtained upon heating {{are different from}} that obtained after cooling at room temperature and that the uranyl precursor used to synthesize (UO 2) O 2 (H 2 O) 2 · 2 H 2 O, sulfate or nitrate, has a strong influence on the peroxide thermal behavior and morphology. The decomposition of (UO 2) O 2 (H 2 O) 2 · 2 H 2 O ex sulfate is pseudomorphic and leads to needle-like shaped particles of metastudtite, (UO 2) O 2 (H 2 O) 2, and UO 3 -x(OH) 2 x·zH 2 O, an amorphous phase found in air in the following of (UO 2) O 2 (H 2 O) 2 dehydration. (UO 2) O 2 (H 2 O) 2 · 2 H 2 O and the compounds resulting from its {{thermal decomposition}} are very reactive towards hydrofluorination {{as long as their}} <b>needle-like</b> <b>morphology</b> is kept...|$|R
40|$|Polished Kanthal AF {{samples were}} {{oxidized}} isothermally at 900 °C in O 2 and in O 2 + 40 % H 2 O for between 1 and 168 hours. The samples were analysed gravimetrically, by Grazing-Incidence X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis and Auger Electron Spectroscopy profiling. Much {{of the surface}} is covered by a thin and smooth base oxide with Mg-rich nodules on top. In addition, patches of thick uneven oxide and RE-oxide protrusions are present on the surface. Exposure to O 2 + 40 % H 2 O results in significantly higher initial oxidation rate than dry O 2. The presence of water vapour also influences oxide morphology. The thick oxide patches <b>exhibit</b> <b>needle-like</b> crystals in dry O 2 while rounded oxide agglomerates dominate in O 2 /H 2 O. The chemical composition of the oxide was the same in O 2 and in O 2 + 40 % H 2 O. α-Al 2 O 3, γ-Al 2 O 3 and MgAl 2 O 4 form in both environments...|$|R
