Pompeo then starred in ABC's popular medical drama Grey's Anatomy (2005–present), and garnered worldwide recognition for her portrayal of the title character Dr. Meredith Grey. The role on the long running series earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama nomination, and the Screen Actors Guild Award.

She had been strangled and sexually assaulted with a vibrator and a large plastic bag had been wrapped around her legs.

A Budweiser towel, a bloody car seat box, a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, a plaid shirt and jeans were all found {{in the vicinity of the}} dump site. Examination of the remains indicated that the body was subjected to high temperatures, which was likely a consequence of her body remaining inside of the vehicle for a long period of time during summer weather.

40|$|Experiment was {{conducted}} during 2011 to 2012 cropping season using potted plants, to evaluate <b>the</b> influence of <b>weeding</b> regime on sugarcane mosaic disease severity in selected improved sugarcane varieties from the University of Ilorin – Nigeria sugarcane germplasm. The experiment {{was laid out}} following a split plot arrangement where <b>the</b> <b>weeding</b> regime constitutes <b>the</b> main plot and the sugarcane varieties were the subplot. Disease parameters such as symptom manifestation, number of diseased leaves, percentage severity were measured. Growth and yield parameters such as stalk length, number of leaves, number of tillers and yield parameters such as fresh and dry shoot weights, percentage dry matter at harvest were also measured. Analysis of variance showed that percentage severity of sugarcane mosaic disease, increased in non-weeded plots compared with weeded plots. Twice weeding (52. 1 %) and <b>the</b> <b>weed</b> free plots (53. 7 %) had the significantly lowest severities. Varietal influence significantly influenced severity and variety NCO- 270 produced the significantly lowest severity (45. 8 %). <b>The</b> interaction of <b>weeding</b> regime and variety indicated that variety CB 36411 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weed</b> free plots, produced the lowest severity (33. 5 %). Yield parameters showed that significantly highest shoot weight was recorded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weed</b> free plot, while variety NCO- 270 gave the highest fresh and dry shoot weights (254. 8 g and 50. 2 g respectively). The results indicate that variety NCO- 270 was the most tolerant and that weeding {{at least once in}} six months is required to mitigate the effect of sugarcane mosaic disease, as witnessed in significantly increased growth and yield attributes of plants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weeded</b> plots...|$|R
