5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845.

At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by <b>genetic</b> <b>analysis</b> in 2002.

40|$|UPGMA analysis, {{principal}} component <b>analysis,</b> <b>genetic</b> diversity <b>analysis</b> and <b>genetic</b> distance <b>analysis</b> of RAPD data {{were used to}} assess the extent of host specialization in 50 isolates of S. homoeocarpa from five turfgrass hosts. In UPGMA analysis and {{principal component}} analysis, the occurrence of host specialization was not readily apparent based on visual inspection. <b>Genetic</b> diversity <b>analysis</b> showed significant differentiation among isolates from different host species (G ST 0 · 34, P < 0 · 001). The strongest evidence for some degree of host specialization came from the statistical <b>analysis</b> of <b>genetic</b> distances among isolates. By grouping pairwise genetic distances between isolates based on their host species, and analysing for average distance within the same host species and among different host species, {{it was found that the}} average distance within species was less than among species (P < 0 · 0001). An analysis of molecular variance of the genetic distances among isolates found that 32 · 3 % of the total variation was attributable to host species. It is concluded that these isolates of S. homoeocarpa showed a weak level of host specialization, which was not readily apparent by UPGMA or principal component analyses, but was revealed by <b>genetic</b> diversity <b>analysis</b> and statistical <b>analysis</b> of <b>genetic</b> distances among isolates.

5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. <b>Genetic</b> <b>analysis</b> reveals that hybridization takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female golden jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene flow into the golden jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure with golden jackals in ancient times.|$|E

5|$|Fairywrens exhibit one of {{the highest}} incidences of extra-pair mating, and many broods are brought up a by male who is not the natural father. However, {{courtship}} methods among white-winged fairywrens remain unclear. Blue-plumaged males have been seen outside of their territory and in some cases, carrying pink or purple petals, which among other species advertise the male to neighboring females. In contrast, black-plumaged males on Barrow and Dirk Hartog islands often carry blue petals. While petal-carrying outside of clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females is occurring, further <b>genetic</b> <b>analysis</b> is necessary.|$|E
5|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has shown}} that certain mallards appear {{to be closer to}} their Indo-Pacific {{relatives}} while others are related to their American relatives.

Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without a good candidate for a local predecessor species. The large ice age palaeosubspecies that made up at least the European and west Asian populations during the Pleistocene has been named Anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{application}} of the Cluster Variation Method to the problem of <b>genetic</b> linkage <b>analysis.</b> The objective of <b>genetic</b> linkage <b>analysis</b> is to link an observed affection status (phenotype) of all individuals in a pedigree to the inheritance pattern observed certain locations on the chromosome. The Bayesian approach introduced by [7] is computationally intractable for large pedigrees and we propose to apply the Cluster Variation Method to approximately compute quantities such as the likelihood of the data. We obtain good results on an important subproblem, the computation of the intractable probability distribution of the inheritance pattern. These results encourage the incorporation of the disease model into the inheritance model. 1 <b>Genetic</b> Linkage <b>Analysis</b> One of the major questions in genetics is to link an observed disease to a certain region on the chromosome.

5|$|In 1997 a {{population}} of P.fluviatile was discovered under the ruins of Trajan's Forum {{in the heart of}} Rome, living in canals built by the Etruscans which connect to the Cloaca Maxima.

The crabs' unusual size, up to , and longevity (up to 15years) are also interpreted as evidence of a long-established population, by analogy with island gigantism.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, a 9-year-old female blacktip shark at the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center {{was found}} to be {{pregnant}} with a single near-term female pup, despite having never mated with a male. <b>Genetic</b> <b>analysis</b> confirmed that her offspring was the product of automictic parthenogenesis, a form of asexual reproduction in which an ovum merges with a polar body to form a zygote without fertilization. Along with an earlier case of parthenogenesis in the bonnethead (Sphyrna tiburo), this event suggests that asexual reproduction may be more widespread in sharks than previously thought.|$|E
