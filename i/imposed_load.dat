Ten trained men (20. 3 ± 2. 0 years, 75. 6 ± 9. 8 kg, 175. 1 ± 5. 1 cm) participated in a training program with self-selected load (time and speed individually preferred) and another with <b>imposed</b> <b>load</b> (even self-selected time and speed 10 % higher). The HR and RPE were measured, every minute of training, by the OMNIWalk/ Run and Borg scales. No significant differences were found in the HR and RPE between training sessions. The correlation between the OMNI-Walk/Run and Borg scales showed a moderate association (r = 0. 55) in training with self-selected load and a strong association in <b>imposed</b> <b>load</b> (r = 0. 79). In this study, self-selected load induced a suboptimal stimulus to elicit favorable organic adaptations. Moreover, high correlation of OMNI Walk/Run and Borg scales with the <b>imposed</b> <b>load</b> showed that the greater the load of training the best were answers of RPE...|$|E

Because such tests require only a small fraction of the total failure time, they are not inherently prohibitive if experimental equipment is available.

40|$|The {{multimedia}} enabled Grid (MEG) is {{an extension}} of the Grid concept to support the deployment of multimedia services. To provide an adequate level of service to multimedia applications, it is often necessary to simultaneously allocate the resources including predetermined capacities from the interconnecting networks to the applications. The simultaneous allocation of resources {{is often referred to as}} co-allocation in the Grid literature. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called synchronous queuing (SQ) for implementing coallocation with quality of service (QoS) assurances in Grids. Unlike existing approaches, SQ does not require advance reservation capabilities at the resources. In the simulation, we increase the <b>imposed</b> <b>load</b> with increasing number of machines to test SQ's effectiveness in addressing the co-allocation problem. This is because the co-allocation complexity is known to increase with the increase of the <b>imposed</b> <b>load.</b> The simulation studies performed to evaluate SQ indicate that it outperforms an admission control-based scheme by a significant margin...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA major {{class of}} work on absorption-based capture systems is the {{prediction}} of separation plant performance for various solvents and solvent mixtures. Typically, equilibrium or rate-based models are used to compute the <b>imposed</b> <b>load</b> (reduction in net electrical output from a power plant) for separation using a given solvent, possibly optimizing over process parameters (such as stripper pressure). This analysis is frequently repeated for each solvent considered. While this type of work shows the potential of each solvent, it does not predict the performance of solvent-based capture systems in general, nor does any single analysis show how an energetically-optimal solvent would behave. In our modeling approach, we choose a specific process architecture, beginning with a standard absorber/stripper configuration, but do not choose a specific solvent. By adjusting the solvent properties as well as process parameters, we seek to find {{the properties of the}} energetically-optimal solvent for a given process configuration, and the <b>imposed</b> <b>load</b> when using that solvent in that process. We also demonstrate that the accuracy of the steam cycle model can {{have a significant impact on}} the optimization of the capture process...|$|E

In the previous study, axial and torsional two load level cumulative fatigue experiments were conducted, in varied combinations, with the low-cycle fatigue (high amplitude loading) applied first. In present study, the high-cycle fatigue (low amplitude loading) is applied initially. As in the previous study, four sequences (axial/axial, torsion/torsion, axial/torsion, and torsion/axial) of two load level cumulative fatigue experiments were performed. The amount of fatigue damage contributed by each of the <b>imposed</b> <b>loads</b> was estimated by both the Palmgren-Miner linear damage rule (LDR) and the non-linear damage curve approach (DCA).
