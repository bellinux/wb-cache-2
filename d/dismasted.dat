5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was initially encountered near the Lesser Antilles on September9 by the ship Frank W.. Later that day, the ship Mary Ann was <b>dismasted.</b> It {{is estimated that}} the cyclone intensified into a Category1 hurricane around 12:00UTC on September9, with winds reaching 80mph (130km/h). The system moved north-northwestward or nort hward for several days and closely approached Bermuda late on September11. Around that time, some ships to the southeast of the island were damaged during the storm and put into Bermuda as a result. By early on September13, the hurricane was beginning to move in a more northeasterly direction. The bark Machae was <b>dismasted</b> on September14. The cyclone weakened to a {{tropical storm}} early the following day. On September16, the Glad Tiding last observed the storm about halfway between Newfoundland and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Villaret in Montagne, having {{successfully}} broken {{contact with}} the British flagship and slipped away to the north, managed to gather 11ships of the line around him and formed them up in a reconstituted battle squadron. At 11:30, with the main action drawing to a close, he began a recovery manoeuvre intended to lessen the tactical defeat his fleet had suffered. Aiming his new squadron at the battered Queen, Villaret's attack created consternation in the British fleet, which was unprepared for a second engagement. However, discerning Villaret's intention, Howe also pulled his ships {{together to create a}} new force. His reformed squadron consisted of Queen Charlotte, Royal Sovereign, Valiant, Leviathan, Barfleur, and Thunderer. Howe deployed this squadron in defence of Queen, and the two short lines engaged one another at a distance before Villaret abandoned his manoeuvre and hauled off to collect several of his own <b>dismasted</b> ships that were endeavouring to escape British pursuit. Villaret was subsequently joined by the battered Terrible, which sailed straight through the dispersed British fleet to reach the French lines, and he also recovered the <b>dismasted</b> Scipion, Mucius, Jemmappes, and Républicain—all of which lay within reach of the unengaged British ships—before turning eastwards towards France. At this stage of the battle, Howe retired below and the British consolidation was left to his Captain of the Fleet, Sir Roger Curtis. Curtis was subsequently blamed by some in the Navy for not capturing more of the <b>dismasted</b> French ships, and was also accused of dissuading Howe from attempting further pursuit.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{followed}} in Vanguard, bringing {{the next two}} ships into action with the starboard side of the French van, catching the French ships in a crossfire that rapidly battered and <b>dismasted</b> the ships, despite determined defence. As the French van was destroyed, HMS Bellerophon and HMS Majestic attacked the French centre. Outnumbered and faced with the massed broadsides of Orient and the 80-gun Franklin and Tonnant, both British ships suffered massive damage. Culloden, {{bringing up the rear}} of the British line, passed too close to the northern shoal and grounded, Troubridge suffering severe damage to his hull despite efforts by Mutine and Leander to drag the ship off. By 19:00 darkness had fallen, and within an hour the French van had been defeated, Guerrier, Conquérant, Spartiate, Aquilon and Peuple Souverain all either in British hands or too badly damaged to continue fighting. The British too had suffered damage, with Vanguard and Goliath badly hit while to the south both Bellerophon and Majestic had been forced to cut their anchor cables and pull away from their respective opponents. Bellerophon had been <b>dismasted,</b> Majestics captain George Blagden Westcott had been killed, and on Vanguard Nelson had suffered a severe head wound.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dismasting</b> {{occurs to}} a sailing ship when {{one or more}} of the masts {{responsible}} for hoisting the sails that propel the vessel is broken or overturned, but the hull itself is still upright and seaworthy. <b>Dismasting</b> usually occurs as the result of high winds during a storm acting upon masts, sails, rigging, and spars. <b>Dismasting</b> does not necessarily impair the vessel's ability to stay afloat, but rather its ability to move under sail power.|$|R
5|$|The {{hurricane}} damaged several vessels {{while still}} drifting at sea, dispersing and damaging Jérôme Bonaparte's fleet and <b>dismasting</b> the 74-gun French ship {{of the line}} , which later landed near Cape Henry.|$|R
50|$|Due to faults in Blackadder, {{which caused}} <b>dismasting</b> on her maiden voyage, Hallowe’en was not {{handed over to}} Willis for nearly 18 months after her launch due to {{protracted}} legal action.|$|R
5|$|The {{subsequent}} hurricane {{was also}} previously unrecognized until contemporary research, {{although the majority}} of its track remains unknown. The only indication that a tropical cyclone existed was the ship David G. Wilson, which was <b>dismasted</b> by a severe storm on September 17. As no other information is available on the hurricane, it is listed in the Atlantic hurricane database as a single point in the central Atlantic (at 28.5°N, 50°W).|$|E
5|$|As dawn {{broke and}} {{visibility}} cleared, the sailors on Ceylon, Vénus and Victor realised {{that they were}} within sight of Saint Denis on Île Bourbon, and thus vulnerable to counterattack from Rowley's flagship Boadicea. Despite hasty repairs, neither Ceylon nor Vénus were seaworthy by 07:30, when British lookouts on the island spotted the three ships and sent word to Rowley. Within ten minutes, Rowley was at sea, taking 50 volunteers from Africaine to augment his crew. Hamelin made desperate efforts to limp back to Île de France, ordering Victor to tow Ceylon, but progress was slow and strong winds, which did not help the <b>dismasted</b> Ceylon and Vénus, repeatedly broke the tow rope.|$|E
5|$|Both Foudroyant and Lion {{were too}} {{battered}} {{to provide an}} effective tow to the <b>dismasted</b> French ship, {{and as a result}} Penelope was left to bring the shattered Guillaume Tell into Syracuse on Sicily. Eventually the ship was repaired sufficiently for the journey to Britain, and there was added to the Royal Navy under the name HMS Malta. Malta was, with HMS Tonnant captured two years earlier at the Nile, the most powerful third rate in the British fleet, and served for many years, participating at the Battle of Cape Finisterre in 1805.|$|E
50|$|In December 2007 {{she had to}} {{be rescued}} by Royal Navy frigate HMS Northumberland after <b>dismasting</b> in severe weather off {{northwest}} Spain whilst competing singlehanded in the Transat Ecover B2B Race.|$|R
50|$|The {{hurricane}} damaged several vessels {{while still}} drifting at sea, dispersing and damaging Jérôme Bonaparte's fleet and <b>dismasting</b> the 74-gun French ship {{of the line}} , which later landed near Cape Henry.|$|R
5000|$|... 1901, November. 'Mary James.' Built 1862 by Richard Tredwen in Padstow. For most of {{her life}} owned by the St. Just family of Harvey James and made many voyages to Wales with copper ore, {{bringing}} back coal for the mines. Sank after <b>dismasting.</b>|$|R
5|$|For {{ten minutes}} after the {{explosion}} there was no firing; sailors from both sides were either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of Orient. At 22:10, Franklin restarted the engagement by firing on Swiftsure. Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon <b>dismasted</b> and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of Swiftsure and Defence. More than half of Franklins crew had been killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the origins of the storm, though modern reanalysis efforts suggest that it was first noted at Barbados on September22. The intensifying {{hurricane}} passed just south of Jamaica on September26 and 27, affecting the island with strong winds and heavy rains. On September28, HMSRacer, a Royal Navy sloop-of-war, encountered the storm in the northwestern Caribbean. She was <b>dismasted</b> and blown on her beam ends twice before re-righting, and a young boy plus two crewmen aboard the ship died during the hurricane. Since the ship was apparently the first to observe the cyclone at sea, writers and historians have commonly referred to the system as Racer'sstorm or Racer'shurricane.|$|E
5|$|Sailing to {{intercept}} the Haitian ship, Yeo discovered {{her in the}} Gulf of Léogane and ordered Gaspard to surrender. The Haitian refused, and the frigates exchanged shots at 06:30. The superior seamanship and discipline on Southampton prevented Gaspard from boarding the British ship with his greater numbers and within half an hour Heureuse Réunion was <b>dismasted</b> and battered. At 07:45 the Haitian ship surrendered, Yeo depositing the crew ashore and bringing Heureuse Réunion to Port Royal, Jamaica. At Jamaica, his actions were approved by his superiors and Heureuse Réunion, renamed Améthyste, was returned to Henri Christophe.|$|E
50|$|All Is Lost, the 2013 American {{survival}} film {{written and}} directed by J. C. Chandor and starring Robert Redford, includes turtling of the Cal 39 sailboat and the liferaft amidst the myriad disasters befalling the protagonist. This turtling results in a <b>dismasting</b> of the boat.|$|R
5000|$|The soft sail yacht {{suffered}} a <b>dismasting</b> during a Mackinac race {{which resulted in}} her being stored for several years. In 2015, Freddie Mills acquired the vessel and has re-rigged and re-commissioned her as a private racing yacht operating out of Newport, Rhode Island.|$|R
5000|$|The schooner's first voyage, {{in ballast}} to Baltimore, Maryland, {{resulted}} in disaster on December 11, 1888 when the foremast snapped in high winds, taking the other masts {{with it and}} <b>dismasting</b> the Governor Ames completely. The anchor chain also broke, and the schooner ran aground on Georges Bank.|$|R
5|$|The {{notion that}} the ship would have nailed her flag and never surrendered, as Barère claimed, is never {{accounted}} {{in any of the}} reports. Though Jean François Renaudin never explicitly states that he surrendered, he does mention that he had his flag flown half-mast in distress when he was surrounded by British ships, indicating that he was requesting assistance from the enemy. Griffiths observes that Vengeur was <b>dismasted</b> to the point that there would have been nothing on which to nail a flag anyway, and James makes mentions of Vengeur hoisting the Union Jack in submission.|$|E
5|$|As Bellerophon slowly drifted away, she was sighted by the 74-gun , {{approaching}} the centre. It was by now about 9 pm; {{in the darkness}} Swiftsures captain, Benjamin Hallowell, was unable to identify the <b>dismasted</b> ship and presumed {{that she was a}} damaged French ship attempting to escape. He debated firing into her, but decided to hold fire and press on to the French centre, where he eventually came to anchor astern of Orient, close to Bellerophons original position. Darby had by this time recovered sufficiently to resume command, and at his order the battered Bellerophon came to anchor at the east end of the bay, and her crew began making repairs. The battle raged throughout the night, and eventually ended in a decisive victory for the British. The next five days were spent repairing the ship and burying the dead. 49 men were killed and 148 wounded on Bellerophon. Eight more died of their wounds in the following week.|$|E
5|$|At 06:00, {{a breeze}} pushed Boadicea forward {{and she began}} to close with her former consort, Rowley {{watching}} as all three of Africaines masts gave way and collapsed over the side one by one. By 08:00, Africaine was a <b>dismasted</b> hull and Corbet was dead {{in the bowels of the}} ship, although the exact manner of his death was to cause lasting controversy. By 10:00, Boadicea had been joined by Otter and Staunch and bore down on the French ships and their prize, so that by 15:30 Bouvet was persuaded to abandon Africaine and tow the damaged Iphigénie back to Port Napoleon. By 17:00, Boadicea pulled alongside Africaine and the French prize crew surrendered. Rowley later reported that a number of British sailors leaped into the sea at his approach and swam to Boadicea, requesting that they be allowed to pursue the French ships in the hope of capturing one.|$|E
2500|$|James & David, Foreman, master, a brig, was sailing from Passages when {{captured}} on 18 May; Surprise put {{the crew of}} Fidelity on her too, and then gave her up to the crews, after first <b>dismasting</b> her; the [...] Revenue Cruiser Beresford towed James and David into Baltimore, County Cork, that same day.|$|R
50|$|After a {{break from}} solo sailing, Conrad {{returned}} to race in the 2014 edition of the Route du Rhum with the Class 40, sponsored by Cat Phones and Bullitt Group. After a difficult start to the race, he suffered a <b>dismasting</b> 400 miles west of Lisbon and had to retire from the race.|$|R
5000|$|In Thousand Oaks, California, Laurence Sunderland {{told reporters}} [...] "She {{got out of}} her vessel with the clothes on her back." [...] Aboard the Ile de la Reunion Sunderland wrote that [...] "one long wave" [...] had brought about the <b>dismasting</b> of her sail boat Wild Eyes, which was {{abandoned}} to the ocean.|$|R
5|$|Behind this combat, {{other ships}} of the centre {{division}} struck the French line, HMS Valiant under Thomas Pringle passing close to Patriote which pulled away, her crew suffering from contagion {{and unable to}} take their ship into battle. Valiant instead turned her attention on Achille, which had already been raked by Queen Charlotte and Brunswick, and badly damaged her before pressing on sail to join the embattled van division. HMS Orion under John Thomas Duckworth and HMS Queen under Admiral Alan Gardner both attacked the same ship, Queen suffering severely from the earlier actions in which her masts were badly damaged and her captain John Hutt mortally wounded. Both ships bore down on the French Northumberland, which was soon <b>dismasted</b> and left attempting to escape on only the stump of a mast. Queen was too slow to engage Northumberland as closely as Orion, and soon fell in with Jemmappes, both ships battering each other severely.|$|E
5|$|Captain Thomas Thompson on Leander {{initially}} {{tried to}} escape the much larger French ship, but it rapidly became clear that Généreux was faster than his vessel. At 09:00 the ships exchanged broadsides, the engagement continuing until 10:30, when Captain Louis-Jean-Nicolas Lejoille made an unsuccessful attempt to board Leander, suffering heavy casualties in the attempt. For another five hours the battle continued, Thompson successfully raking Généreux at one stage but ultimately being outfought and outmanoeuvered by the larger warship. Eventually the wounded Thompson surrendered his <b>dismasted</b> ship by ordering his men to wave a French tricolour on a pike. As French sailors took possession of the British ship, Lejoille encouraged systematic looting of the sailors' personal possessions, even confiscating the surgeon's tools {{in the middle of}} an operation. Against the established conventions of warfare, he forced the captured crew to assist in bringing Leander safely into Corfu, and denied them food and medical treatment unless they co-operated with their captors.|$|E
5|$|Concorde {{was one of}} a three-ship {{class of}} Concorde-class frigates built for the French Navy to a design by Henri Chevillard. She was built at Rochefort between April 1777 and January 1778, being {{launched}} on 3 September 1777. She went out to the West Indies after the French entry to the American War of Independence, and reached Martinique on 17 August 1778. On 28 August 1778 she came up on the 32-gun , under Captain John Stott, and after {{two and a half hours}} of fighting, captured her. Minerva was towed to Cap Français on Saint-Domingue, where she was joined shortly afterwards by the captured , which a hurricane had <b>dismasted</b> in late August and which the French frigates Charmante and Dédaigneuse had captured on 1 September.|$|E
5000|$|James & David, Foreman, master, a brig, was sailing from Passages when {{captured}} on 18 May; Surprise put {{the crew of}} Fidelity on her too, and then gave her up to the crews, after first <b>dismasting</b> her; the Revenue Cruiser Beresford towed James and David into Baltimore, County Cork, that same day.|$|R
500|$|As the American ship approached, Broke {{spoke to}} his crew, ending with a {{description}} of his philosophy of gunnery, [...] "Throw no shot away. Aim every one. Keep cool. Work steadily. Fire into her quarters– maindeck to maindeck, quarterdeck to quarterdeck. Don't try to <b>dismast</b> her. Kill the men and the ship is yours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, Oakes," [...] said Bluewater, with {{a sudden}} {{interest}} in such a subject, that he never expected to feel again, [...] "I have heard nothing of the first day's work, in which, through the little I have gleaned, by listening to those around me, I understand you took a two-decker, besides <b>dismasting</b> the French admiral?" ...|$|R
5|$|<b>Dismasted,</b> Defence {{was unable}} to hold any of her various opponents to a {{protracted}} duel, and by 13:00 was threatened by the damaged Républicain moving from the east. Although Républicain later hauled off to join Villaret to the north, Gambier requested support for his ship from the fleet's frigates and was aided by HMS Phaeton under Captain William Bentinck. As Impétueux passed she fired on Phaeton, to which Bentinck responded with several broadsides of his own. Invincible, the only ship of the forward division of the British centre to engage the enemy closely, became embroiled in the confusion surrounding Queen Charlotte. Invincible's guns drove Juste onto the broadside of Queen Charlotte, where {{she was forced to}} surrender to Lieutenant Henry Blackwood in a boat from Invincible. Among the other ships of the division there were only minor casualties, although HMS Impregnable lost several yards and was only brought back into line by the quick reactions of two junior officers, Lieutenant Robert Otway and Midshipman Charles Dashwood.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} {{hour and a half}} the frigates poured shot into one another at close range, until Cooke was struck by grape shot at 01:30 on 1 March, {{replaced}} by his first lieutenant Lucius Hardyman. For another hour the action continued, French fire gradually slackening until it stopped completely at 02:30, by which time only four French guns remained operational. Hardyman hailed to ask whether Forte had surrendered but the French did not reply and he ordered another broadside. A second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair the rigging on Forte. Concerned that the French were attempting to escape, Hardyman concentrated his fire on the masts of Forte, bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03:00 Forte was completely <b>dismasted.</b> With all resistance ended, British merchant prisoners on board Forte emerged from below decks and hailed Sybille, requesting a boat be sent across so that British Lieutenant Nicholas Manger could formally take the surrender of the French ship.|$|E
5|$|Late in the {{afternoon}} of 13 January 1798, Sybille and Fox arrived in Manila Bay, slipping unchallenged past the fortress of Corregidor and then sailing across the bay {{on the morning of}} 14 January, anchoring between Manila and Cavite. From his vantage point Cooke could see the Spanish squadron <b>dismasted</b> and under repair in Cavite, the ships of the line San Pedro, Europa and Montañés and the frigates Maria de la Cabeya and Luisa in dock and unfit for action. To Cooke's disappointment he could also see the Manila galleon, Marquesetta being unloaded at the Cavite docks and another valuable merchant ship Rey Carlos aground in the harbour. The Spanish had learned only shortly before Cooke's arrival that the British frigate HMS Resistance under Captain Edward Pakenham was in Philippine waters and had decided to remove the valuable cargo from the treasure ship rather than risk an attack.|$|E
5000|$|With the {{announcement}} in 1960 {{of the first}} single-handed trans-Atlantic yacht race (from Plymouth, UK to the US East Coast), Lewis decided to enter in a small 25-foot boat. Following a series of accidents, including a <b>dismasting</b> shortly after leaving, he finished third (Francis Chichester came first), as described in his book The Ship Would Not Travel Due West.|$|R
2500|$|D'Iberville, in the Envieux, fired {{upon the}} English frigate Newport, {{under the command}} of Captain Paxen, <b>dismasting</b> her. The prize falling astern, came almost aboard the bow of the Envieux, and lowered her flag. M. D'Iberville left her to be manned by M. de Bonaventure, who gave her to Baptiste {{to take her to the}} river St. John, at which place he almost lost her among the rocks where she run aground.|$|R
25|$|Trying again, Ashbury {{offered a}} best-of-seven match race {{challenge}} for October 1871, which the NYYC accepted provided a defending yacht could be chosen {{on the morning}} of each race. Ashbury's new yacht Livonia (264 tons) was beaten twice in a row by Osgood's new centreboard schooner Columbia (220 tons), which withdrew in the third race after <b>dismasting.</b> The yacht Sappho then stepped in as defender to win the fourth and fifth races, thereby successfully defending the cup.|$|R
