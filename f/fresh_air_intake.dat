Wind data in the experiments covered most local meteorological conditions. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6), used as a tracer gas in the field experiments, was released in a particular fume hood of the laboratory block. In all experiments, the field dilution rates varied from 1 x 10 [to the power of 3] to 1 x 10 [to the power of 6] at different sampling points of roof plane and <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>intakes.</b> One of the main goals {{of this study was}} to evaluate the Pasquill-Gifford formula for concentration field prediction, moreover, the Wilson type of formulas were adopted for minimum dilution rate estimation. Comparisons of field concentration with that calculated from Pasquill-Gifford formula and that of reported wind tunnel results have been performed. The results demonstrated the validity of the modified Pasquill-Gifford formula for concentration field prediction on large plain roof where the predictions and field data were in the same order of magnitude. The concentrations detected at the <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> were in the same range. For the area around a bossed building, the field data detected lower readings than Pasquill-Gifford predictions due to some strong turbulent mixing.

However, {{there is ample evidence}} that biomass combustion emits significant quantities of health damaging pollutants. We investigated the near-source micro-environmental air quality impact of a biomass-fueled combined heat and power system equipped with an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) in Syracuse, NY. Two rooftop sampling stations with PM 2. 5 and CO 2 analyzers were established in such that one could capture the plume while the other one served as the background for comparison depending on the wind direction. Four sonic anemometers were deployed around the stack to quantify spatially and temporally resolved local wind patterns. Fuel-based emission factors were derived based on near-source measurement. The Comprehensive Turbulent Aerosol Dynamics and Gas Chemistry (CTAG) model was then applied to simulate the spatial variations of primary PM 2. 5 without ESP. Our analysis shows that the absence of ESP could lead to an almost 7 times increase in near-source primary PM 2. 5 concentrations with a maximum concentration above 100  μg m− 3 at the building rooftop. The above-ground “hotspots” would pose potential health risks to building occupants since particles could penetrate indoors via infiltration, natural ventilation, and <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> on the rooftop of multiple buildings. Our results demonstrated the importance of emission control for biomass combustion systems in urban area, and the need to take above-ground pollutant “hotspots” into account when permitting distributed generation.

40|$|One of {{the major}} causes of poor indoor air quality in {{buildings}} is exhaust re-ingestion at <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>intakes.</b> The downwash effect of an RTS on plume may lead to significantly increased levels of re-ingestion. The present study aims to quantify the downwash effect of an RTS located upwind of a stack. Wind-tunnel modeling is used to model the flow and dispersion associated with various building/RTS arrangements {{with a focus on}} "micro-scale" urban dispersion; that is, modeling dispersion within a range of 100 m of the building exhaust. Wind-tunnel techniques include flow visualization and tracer gas experiments. The influence of various key parameters, such as building height, RTS crosswind width, stack height, exhaust momentum ratio, stack location, and wind direction is considered. Concentration measurements were obtained at sampling locations downwind of the RTS on the building roof. It was found that the downwash effect of RTS on plumes could increase roof -level concentrations by a factor of 2 to 100. The RTS downwash effect was intensified with an increase in RTS crosswind width and was generally stronger for an oblique wind than for a normal wind. The results also showed that an RTS engulfed inside the building recirculation zone may not {{have a significant effect on}} plume dispersion for winds approximately normal to the building face. The minimum dilution models recommended by ASHRAE (2003, 2007) as well as the ASHRAE Geometric Stack Design Method (AGM) were evaluated. It was found that the ASHRAE models do not account for the downwash effect of the RTS on plumes and result in either overly conservative or un-conservative predictions. Therefore, a new empirical model, which takes into consideration the downwash effect of RTS was proposed. A validation study of the proposed model using results from previous experimental studies showed that the model is more accurate than the ASHRAE dilution models. Thus the proposed model will be very useful to practicing engineers. In addition, some modifications to the ASHRAE (2007) dispersion model and the AGM are also propose...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) {{simulations}} {{are carried}} out to select a better <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> system for a new fire laboratory, designed for experiments with a maximum fire heat release rate of 7 MW. Two different <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> systems are considered: a louver system around the lower perimeter of the building or a chimney system that employs vertical ducts to bring <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> down from the roof to {{the lower part of}} the building. The two systems are investigated with different fire sizes and wind speeds. The results show that the chimney system gives a more stable smoke and temperature stratification inside the building and a higher hot smoke layer above the floor. The louver system, on the other hand, gives rise to unsymmetrical air movements inside the building when the wind speed outside is high. The louver system also yields a lower hot smoke layer that can spill smoke through the louvers to the outside of the building, especially for small fires with low exhaust flow rates. The results, therefore, suggest that an evenly distributed chimney system would provide a more stable ventilation environment for conducting fire experiments and would prevent smoke leakage to the outside of the building.

5000|$|In 1951 GM {{incorporated}} {{several small}} body, mechanical and electrical improvements into the model, {{enough to warrant}} the change once again of the model number to PD-4103. The easiest spotting features of a PD-4103 over the rare PD-4102 are that the later model included a rear luggage bay door {{on the left side}} that did not appear on either the PD-4101 or PD-4102, as well as an improved refrigeration system, using the same Ingersoll-Rand rotary vane compressor as previous models, but with a larger evaporator coil using a better expansion valve and a larger supply fan located over the rear passengers' seats. To further improve air circulation and <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>intake,</b> exhaust fans were incorporated into the soffit at the head of each interior luggage rack, which operated from the same rheostat that controlled the main blower. Also included was a new, higher rated Delco generator and an improved voltage regulator, a redesigned reverse gear solenoid on the transmission, various evolutionary improvements to the 6-71 GM Diesel (tougher alloy exhaust valves and improved S-55 injectors as standard) and other miscellaneous minor improvements, including the addition of a [...] "black light" [...] instrument panel, in which the instruments had radium painted figures, very similar to what Ford introduced on their 1950 Ford passenger cars. Production of this bus totaled 1,501 with Greyhound Lines buying a substantial quantity. Many also operated for Trailways and other operators. Trailways sorely needed the GM Diesels, as the Hall-Scott 190-powered IC41 Brills had notoriously heavy fuel consumption, often achieving only 1.5 to 2 miles per gallon on a route on which a PD-4103 could easily get 7 on cheaper #1 Diesel fuel. The Brills, however, were far more powerful, and much faster than the PD-4103s on the flat. The PD-4103 was the first GM Coach offered with an optional restroom, or with facilities for an optional food buffet, a feature used on many cars ordered by Trailways. The PD-4103 restroom was problematic, as the overhead for the refrigeration unit and engine air intake severely restricted headroom. This problem was rectified in the successor PD-4104, which set the pattern for bus restrooms for all manufacturers for the next 50 years.|$|E

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is a major}} concern in industrialized countries. In dense urban areas, the most common sources of pollutants are the exhaust stacks, ventilators, and cooling towers located on top of buildings. Depending on wind characteristics and flow re-circulations induced by adjacent buildings, effluents can be transported toward <b>fresh</b> <b>air</b> <b>intakes</b> and contaminate indoor air causing health problem to the buildings’ occupants. This particular urban pollution case is known as re-entrainment of pollutants. Unfortunately, the available dispersion models are not adapted to analyse such problems, since they were developed for an isolated building configuration. The present research aims to investigate pollutant aerodynamics and re-entrainment potential for non-isolated building configurations using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. To do so, the steady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach was evaluated and compared with wind tunnel data and ASHRAE- 2011 dispersion model results. The best numerical model possible was defined by performing a sensitivity analysis on the effect of meshing, turbulence model, convergence criteria and turbulent Schmidt number (Sct). For passive scalar transport, it was observed that RANS underestimates dilution when using the standard Sct = 0. 7, perhaps due to the inherent incapacity of RANS in reproducing unsteadiness of flow. However, a sensitivity analysis showed that a better agreement is obtained with Sct = 0. 3, which is within the range of values suggested in the literature. Furthermore, a comparative performance evaluation of steady and unsteady approaches was carried out. Three unsteady modelling techniques were compared: unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS), Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The flow pattern within the wake of a two-building configuration was evaluated and dispersion of pollutants compared against wind tunnel data. The influence of meshing size, time step and inlet boundary conditions was discussed. URANS using the Realizable k-ɛ model, fails to reproduce unsteadiness, and dilution values converge to the same RANS results but DES captures well the unsteadiness of the flow. LES dilution predictions are not satisfactory in all locations, perhaps because the mesh used was not sufficiently refined near the walls. It was concluded that under these specified computing conditions, DES showed results closer to experimental data than all other approaches considered. Finally, RANS was selected to perform a series of simulations for three non-isolated building configurations: a building located upstream of an emitting building, a building located downstream of an emitting building and an emitting building between two tall buildings. After performing a parametric analysis of geometric characteristics of adjacent buildings, a guideline for safe placement of intakes on buildings façades was proposed. In line with the previous results, this thesis provides three relevant contributions. First, in terms of numerical simulation, the thesis contributes with insights concerning computational simulation for pollutant dispersion in urban areas. Second, additional information in terms of normalized dilution values, contours and streamlines for different building configurations (isolated and non-isolated) is given in order to better comprehend the pollutant dispersion in the urban environment. Third, the thesis offers a guideline with practical recommendations regarding safe placement of intakes to avoid pollutants re-ingestion. These results are also a source of data to code and standard writing bodies. ...|$|R
