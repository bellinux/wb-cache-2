Extremities and chest received a dose greater than the prescription dose in many instances (more than 20 % of measurements). Homogeneous dose delivery to the whole body is checked by calculating the mean dose with standard deviation for each fraction.

The integrated setup consists of a THz photomixer which is feeding a quasi-optical double slot antenna structure. Outset is taken in the physical model of a p-i-n diode photomixer implemented in Advanced Design System, Agilent. Several physical properties {{are added to the}} existing p-i-n model.

40|$|Purpose: Radiotherapy (RT) is {{a common}} {{treatment}} of head-and-neck carcinoma. The objective {{of this study was}} to perform a prospective multivariate assessment of the dose-effect relationship between intensity-modulated RT and hearing loss. Methods and Materials: Pure tone audiometry at 0. 250 - 16 kHz was obtained before and after treatment in 101 patients (202 ears). All Patients received full-course intensity-modulated RT (range, 56 - 70 Gy), with a median cochlear dose of 11. 4 Gy (range, 0. 2 - 69. 7). Results: Audiometry was performed 1 week before and a median of 9 weeks (range, 1 - 112) after treatment. The mean hearing deterioration at pure tone average air-conduction 1 - 2 - 4 kHz was small (from 28. 6 dB HL to 30. 1 dB HL). However, individual patients showed clinically significant hearing loss, with 10 -dB threshold shift incidences of 13 % and 18 % at pure tone averages air-conduction 1 - 2 - 4 kHz and 8 - 10 - 12. 5 kHz, respectively. Post-treatment hearing capability was unfavorable in the case of greater inner ear radiation doses (p < 0. 0001), unfavorable baseline hearing capability (p < 0. 0001), green-eyed patients (p < 0. 0001), and older age (p < 0. 0001). Using multivariate analysis, a prediction of individual hearing capabiltity after treatment was made. Conclusion: RT-induced hearing loss in the mean population is modest. However, clinically significant hearing loss was observed in older patients with green eyes and unfavorable pretreatment hearing. In these patients, the <b>intended</b> <b>radiation</b> dose may be adjusted according to the proposed predictive model, aiming to decrease the risk of ototoxicity.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the potential predictive value of histology in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with curatively intended radiotherapy. In a collaborative effort among all the Swedish Oncology Departments, clinical data were collected for 1146 patients with a diagnosed non-small cell lung cancer subjected to curatively intended irradiation (>= 50 Gy) during the years 1990 to 2000. The included patients were identified based on a manual search of all medical and radiation charts at the oncology departments from which the individual patient data were collected. Only patients who did not have a histological diagnosis date and death date/last follow-up date were excluded (n = 141). Among the 1146 patients with non-small cell carcinoma eligible for analysis, 919 were diagnosed with either adenocarcinoma (n = 323) or squamous cell carcinoma (n = 596) and included in this study. The median survival for the 919 patients was 14. 8 months, while the 5 -year survival rate was 9. 5 %. Patients with adenocarcinoma had a significantly better overall survival compared with patients with squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0. 0062, log-rank test). When comparing different stages, this survival benefit was most pronounced for stages IIA-IIB (p< 0. 0001, log-rank test). The difference in survival between the two histological groups was statistically significant in a univariate Cox analysis (p = 0. 0063) as well as in two multivariate Cox analyses including demographic and treatment variables (p = 0. 037 and p = 0. 048, respectively).

40|$|A primary {{objective}} {{for the field}} of vacuum electronics {{is the development of}} devices capable of generating coherent, high power radiation within the sub-mm regime. The electron cyclotron maser instability offers an attractive method of fulfilling such requirements, being a well established mechanism for obtaining coherent, high power radiation within the mm-band. However, operation at high harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency, ωc, proves challenging, given the sensitivity of parasitic modes to the large beam currents required. Previously, particle-in-cell simulations have been presented on the simultaneous operation of a gyrotron cavity at the 2 nd and 4 th harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency[1]. Such a co-harmonic scheme is used to obtain high frequency radiation through the direct excitation of a low harmonic signal. By then trapping the low harmonic within the interaction region, {{through the use of a}} cut-off aperture, pure output of the high harmonic signal can be realised. However, the <b>intended</b> output <b>radiation</b> is dominated by a mode converted 2 nd harmonic signal.

40|$|Electronic components, {{based on}} current {{semiconductor}} technologies and operating in radiation rich environments, suffer degradation of their performance {{as a result of}} radiation exposure. Silicon carbide (SiC) provides an alternate solution as a radiation hard material, because of its wide bandgap and higher atomic displacement energies, for devices <b>intended</b> for <b>radiation</b> environment applications. However, the radiation tolerance and reliability of SiC-based devices needs to be understood by testing devices  under controlled radiation environments. These kinds of studies have been previously performed on diodes and MESFETs, but multilayer devices such as bipolar junction transistors (BJT) have not yet been studied. In this thesis, SiC material, BJTs fabricated from SiC, and various dielectrics for SiC passivation are studied by exposure to high energy ion beams with selected energies and fluences. The studies reveal that the implantation induced crystal damage in SiC material can be partly recovered at relatively low temperatures, for damag elevels much lower than needed for amorphization. The implantation experiments performed on BJTs in the bulk of devices show that the degradation in deviceperformance produced by low dose ion implantations can be recovered at 420 oC, however, higher doses produce more resistant damage. Ion induced damage at the interface of passivation layer and SiC in BJT has also been examined in this thesis. It is found that damaging of the interface by ionizing radiation reduces the current gain as well. However, for this type of damage, annealing at low temperatures further reduces the gain. Silicon dioxide (SiO 2) is today the dielectric material most often used for gate dielectric or passivation layers, also for SiC. However, in this thesis several alternate passivation materials are investigated, such as, AlN, Al 2 O 3 and Ta 2 O 5. These materials are deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) both as single layers and in stacks, combining several different layers. Al 2 O 3 is further investigated with respect to thermalstability and radiation hardness. It is observed that high temperature treatment of Al 2 O 3 can substantially improve the performance of the dielectric film. A radiation hardness study furthermore reveals that Al 2 O 3 is more resistant to ionizing radiation than currently used SiO 2 and it is a suitable candidate for devices in radiation rich applications.

40|$|We thank F. O. Strasser, V. Montaldo, J. Douglas, and J. J. Bommer for the {{interest}} {{they have shown}} in our article (Convertito and Herrero, 2004). Strasser et al. (2006) present a critical comment of our work arguing that the solution proposed by Bommer et al. (2003) is a better solution. Note that the authors are nearly the same in both article and comment, except for V. Montaldo. Because this brief article is a reply, we {{will focus on the}} arguments directly concerning our article. The main objection supported by Strasser et al. (2006) is that the method we proposed is not appropriate to "styleof-faulting" correction. We completely agree with this assertion because it is simply not the scope of our article. We speak about "focal mechanism" <b>intended</b> as <b>radiation</b> pattern and nothing else. This point is clearly stated in the introduction of Convertito and Herrero (2004) : "in this article we consider that the focal mechanism influence is only expressed by radiation pattern changes. In particular we do not consider any tectonic influence, stress drop variation or dynamic effects. " The style-of-faulting parameter, even if its identity is blurred (e. g., Bommer et al., 2003), is an empirical definition of a complex set of physical conditions including the tectonic regime, the medium behavior, rock mechanics, rupture dynamics, and so on. In our opinion, the style of faulting is simply too complex to be used directly in our approach. Because the scope of our article is to show how it is possible to insert inside the main equation of probabilistic seismic-hazard analysis (PSHA; e. g., Cornell, 1968), simple physical parameters of the seismic source, that is, how it is possible to integrate deterministic parameters inside a probabilistic approach, we have chosen a small target, limiting ourselves only to the radiation pattern. We believe that the same approach can be used to insert many other parameters of the seismic source inside PSHA by using only a theoretical approach such as the fault strike (which has already been shown by Convertito, 2004), the directivity and stress drop. The second important argumentation is that a method based on regression (i. e., Bommer et al., 2003) is better than the method we propose. Once again we agree with Strasser et al. (2006) and this is clearly stated in the conclusion of our article: "when an attenuation law, including a faulting style parameter, is available for a given region, the use of this attenuation law gives a more reliable estimate of the hazard than the one obtained using the corrective coefficient we propose in this article. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aim was to}} {{quantify}} severe transient and persisting late term effects in our single institution head neck cancer (HNC) cohort treated with curatively <b>intended</b> intensity modulated <b>radiation</b> therapy (IMRT). Hypothesis was if a 2 -year follow up (FU) is sufficient to estimate the long term tolerance in HNC irradiated in the IMRT era. METHODS: Between 01 / 2002 - 8 / 2012, 707 / 1211 (58 %) consecutively treated IMRT patients met the inclusion criteria of a FU time > 12 months and loco-regional disease control (LRC). 45 % presented with loco-regionally advanced disease; 55 % were referred for curative definitive IMRT (66 Gy- 72 Gy in 30 - 35 fractions), 45 % underwent postoperative IMRT (60 - 66 Gy in 30 - 33 fractions). Systemic concomitant therapy was administered in 85 %. Highly consistent treatment procedures were performed with respect to contouring processes, dose constraints, radiation schedules, {{and the use of}} systemic therapy. Grade 3 / 4 late term effects were prospectively assessed and analyzed with respect to subgroups at particular risk for specific late effects. RESULTS: Mean/median FU of the cohort was 41 / 35 months (15 - 124). 13 % of the patients (92 / 707) experienced any grade 3 / 4 late effects (101 events in 92 / 707 patients), 81 % in the first 12 months after radiation. 4 % of all developed persisting late grade 3 / 4 effects (25 events in 25 / 707 patients). CONCLUSIONS: IMRT led to a high late term tolerance in loco-regionally disease free HNC patients. The onset of any G 3 / 4 effects showed a plateau at 2 years. The question of the cervical vessel tolerance in disease free long time survivors is still open and currently under evaluation at our institution. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Direct Radiation Monitoring Network is {{operated}} by the NRC in cooperation with participating states to provide continuous measurement of the ambient radiation levels around licensed NRC facilities, primarily power reactors. Ambient radiation levels result from naturally occurring radionuclides present in the soil, cosmic radiation constantly bombarding the earth from outer space, and the contribution, if any, from the monitored facilities and other man-made sources. The Network is <b>intended</b> to measure <b>radiation</b> levels during routine facility operations and to establish background radiation levels {{used to assess the}} radiological impact of an unusual condition, such as an accident. This report presents the radiation levels measured around all facilities in the Network for the third quarter of 1995. A complete listing of the site facilities monitored is included. In some instances, two power reactor facilities are monitored by the same set of dosimeters (e. g., Kewaunee and Point Beach). All radiation measurements are made using small, passive detectors called therinoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), which provide a quantitative measurement of the radiation levels in the area in which they are placed. Each site is monitored by arranging approximately 40 to 50 TLD stations in two concentric rings extending to about five miles from the facility. All TLD stations are outside the site boundary of the facility. A complete description of the program can be found in NUREG- 0837, Volume 2, Number 4. A similar description can also be found in the fourth quarter report of each subsequent year. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (formerly the National Bureau of Standards) has performed an independent study of the following characteristics of the NRC dosimetry system; energy response, angular dependence, temperature and humidity sensitivity, fading, light dependence, self-irradiation, and reproducibility...|$|R
40|$|Objective Radiation fears {{following}} Japan’s 2011 Fukushima {{nuclear disaster}} impacted levels {{of physical activity}} in local children. We assessed the post- versus pre-disaster weight status in school children, and evaluated to what extent school restrictions on outdoor activities that were <b>intended</b> to reduce <b>radiation</b> exposure risk affected child weight. Participants We considered children aged 13 – 15 years from {{four of the five}} secondary schools in Soma City (n= 1, 030, 99. 1 % of all children in the city), located in 35 – 50 km from the Fukushima nuclear plant, post- (2012 and 2015) and pre-disaster (2010). Methods Weight status, in terms of body mass index (BMI), percentage of overweight (POW), and incidence of obesity and underweight (defined as a POW ≥ 20 % and ≤ - 20 %, respectively), were examined and compared pre- and post-disaster using regression models. We also constructed models {{to assess the impact of}} school restrictions on outdoor activity on weight status. Results After adjustment for covariates, a slight decrease in mean BMI and POW was detected in females in 2012 (- 0. 37, 95 % CI: - 0. 68 to - 0. 06; and - 1. 97, 95 % CI: - 3. 57 to - 0. 36, respectively). For male children, obesity incidence increased in 2012 (odds ratio for obesity: 1. 45, 95 % CI: 1. 02 to 2. 08). Compared to pre-disaster weight status, no significant weight change was identified in 2015 in either males or females. School restrictions on outdoor activities were not significantly associated with weight status. Conclusions Four years following the disaster, weight status has recovered to the pre-disaster levels for both males and females; however a slight decrease in weight in females, and a slight increased risk of obesity was observed in males one year following the disaster. Our findings could be used to guide actions taken during the early phase of a radiological disaster to manage the post-disaster health risks in adolescent children...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} hard X-ray zone plates <b>intended</b> for focusing <b>radiation</b> at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs). XFELs provide unprecedented brightness and zone plates which are put in the intense X-ray beam {{are at risk of}} being damaged. Therefore, it is crucial to perform damage tests in order to design zone plates which can survive the XFEL beam. Zone plates are diffractive nanofocusing optics and are regularly used at high brightness synchrotron beamlines in the soft and hard X-ray regime. The resolution of a zone plate is proportional to its outermost zonewidth and thus depends on the smallest feature that can be fabricated. State-of-the-art nanofabrication processes developed for zone plates are able to produce zonewidths down to 10 nm. However, for hard X-rays, the zone plates need to be of sufficient thickness to efficiently focus the radiation. Thus, the limit in the fabrication of hard X-ray zone plates lies in the high aspect-ratios. This Thesis describes two processes developed for high aspect-ratio nanostructuring. The first process uses tungsten as diffractive material. Aspect-ratios up to 1 : 15 have been accomplished. Furthermore, a mounting method of a central stop directly on the zone plate is also presented. The other fabrication process uses diamond, in which aspect-ratios of 1 : 30 have been demonstrated. Both processes rely on thin-film deposition techniques, electron-beam lithography, and reactive ion etching. Thanks to the materials’ excellent thermal properties these types of zone plates should be suitable for XFEL applications. Tungsten and diamond diffractive optics have been tested at an XFEL at Stanford (LCLS), and damage investigations were performed {{in order to determine the}} maximum fluence that could be imposed on the optics before degradation occured. The conclusion of these damage tests is that tungsten and diamond diffractive optics can survive the XFEL beam and could potentially be used in beamline experiments relying on nanofocused X-ray beams. Finally in this Thesis, characterization of two zone plates using an interferometer is presented, where it is also shown that the interferometric method can be used to pin-point beamline instabilities.

40|$|The {{concept for}} a novel new antenna design is {{presented}} and investigated for application to {{ground penetrating radar}} (GPR). The proposed new antenna design is called the shielded magnetic bowtie antenna (MBA). As the name suggests, it is predominately constructed from a bowtie-shaped volume of magnetic material that is fed from {{the centre of the}} structure by a small magnetic loop antenna. This thesis develops the magnetic antenna concept and investigates its potential for GPR predominately through numerical modelling. However, {{a significant part of the}} investigation concentrates on validating the numerical modelling technique developed to study the shielded MBA by comparing the results with measurements obtained from a scale model constructed to operate in the watertank antenna test facility, a controlled environment for GPR antenna research. The broadband properties required for GPR antennas are achieved uniquely with the shielded MBA design by a combination of the antenna shape being defined in terms of angles and an inherent magnetic loss mechanism within the antenna material structure. The design also affords an intrinsically placed antenna shield that has the potential for mitigating problems typically experienced with shielding electric dipole antennas. Antenna shielding is an important consideration for GPR antenna designers, especially given the recent US government (FCC) changes that restrict radiated energy emissions within the regulated spectrum used by GPR systems. In addition to providing the <b>intended</b> directional <b>radiation</b> properties, the magnetic antenna shield also provides an elegant solution for a low-loss wideband balun, allowing the antenna to be effectively fed from an unbalanced coaxial transmission line. Other important aspects of the proposed design are discussed in relation to the requirements for GPR antennas. Numerical models of the magnetic antenna concept show encouraging bandwidth results. For example, from a simple comparison with an equivalent sized electric bowtie antenna model, the effective gain bandwidth of the magnetic antenna is found to be at least 3 -octaves compared to approximately 2 -octaves for the electric bowtie. The shielded magnetic antenna achieves a gain of approximately 2 dB, compared to 5 dB for the unshielded electric bowtie antenna. However, it is noted that the magnetic antenna models contain significantly more loss compared to the electric bowtie model. The shielded MBA design emerged from a theoretical investigation of electrically small GPR antennas, given that the initial thesis objective was to investigate ways of improving low frequency GPR antennas. In general, GPR systems are operated with electric dipole antennas, such as the electric bowtie. Interestingly, the electrically small antenna investigation revealed that only the small magnetic loop (i. e., magnetic dipole) antenna can be constructed to approach, arbitrarily closely, the fundamental bandwidth limit for small antennas. This surprising and counter intuitive result is shown to be theoretically achievable with the use of magnetic materials. For the small loop antenna, energy stored within the antenna structure can be avoided by filling the antenna sphere with a perfect magnetic material. This theoretical argument is discussed and supported by numerically modelled results. The electrically small antenna investigation presented in this thesis extends to include the influence that proximity to a lossy dielectric half-space has, on improving the antenna impedance bandwidth. This investigation is of general interest for GPR; it is performed numerically and supported by measurements conducted on an experimental loop antenna situated at various heights above the ground. These results provide support for the hypothesis that a magnetic antenna may experience less influence from near-field changes in the dielectric properties of the ground compared to the equivalent sized electric field antenna...|$|R
