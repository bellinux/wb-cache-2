25|$|The battle {{itself was}} smaller in scale when {{compared}} to the Battle of Ticinus. Although Fabius was not duped by Hannibal’s moves, his blocking force at the pass was. Leonard Cottrell, in his book “Hannibal: Enemy of Rome", wrote that the trick was designed to be recognized by Fabius as a trick. Hannibal had studied the mind of his opponent, and devised a plan to make him <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Hannibal needed him to do. Fabius thought Hannibal was {{trying to get him to}} fight a night action over broken, uneven ground, where Roman infantry would lose their greatest advantages of discipline and teamwork, as their formations would become disorganized. Since Hannibal was choosing the battle ground and the hour, he might have sprung other surprises to gain further advantages on the Romans. Fabius predictably did what Hannibal had anticipated: nothing. The Romans guarding the pass, with no Fabius to keep them in check, thought they were doing their job when they rushed out, preventing a Carthaginian escape. Again, they acted as Hannibal had anticipated, and the Carthaginians took advantage of their actions to escape.|$|E

500|$|After partnering {{for one of}} Kindt's {{previous}} works, , Dark Horse Publisher Mike Richardson asked Kindt {{to pitch}} another book. Kindt sent the proposal for MIND MGMT and was happy when it was accepted because Dark Horse was [...] "the only publisher able to pay me a living wage and also let me <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> I wanted no matter what." [...] The series was initially approved for over 50 issues, but Kindt pruned away excess material and reduced the run to 36 issues. Despite the reduction in length, the final product is still almost {{identical to the original}} pitch. Diana Schutz, editor of 3 Story, was originally slated to work with Kindt again, but the project was handed to newly promoted editor Brendan Wright very early in production.

500|$|Reilly further {{added that}} the renewal was also {{prompted}} by the high risk of trying to replace Fringe with another show with unknown viewership metrics; he commented that they [...] "have a far better shot of sticking with a show that has an audience that [...] think [...] can grow". Prior to {{the onset of the}} fourth season, Reilly reiterated that they do not expect any significant growth in Fringes viewership within that season: [...] "It’s a pretty complex show. If Fringe can <b>do</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> Fringe did last year, we’re going to be very happy. They’re right in the pocket creatively once again." [...] Wyman stated in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter that the Fox network had been [...] "supportive throughout this process", and though the show's viewership [...] "wasn't exactly what they would've hoped for", aspects such as a loyal fan base and supportive critics were enough to take the show forward for another season. Pinkner commented that [...] "there were no creative conditions" [...] on the show's renewal, nor any cuts in the show's budget, though was unsure if the show will be moved to a different time slot. Noble, at the 2011 Comic-Con Fringe panel, reiterated that the fans were responsible for the livelihood of the show, stated, [...] "Seriously, without your efforts, your rabid support, we wouldn’t be here right now. You are the best fans that ever existed". The fourth season premiered on September 23, 2011.|$|E

The song was originally recorded for the Cast of Thousands record but omitted from the final album as the band felt it did not fit; the political lyrics suited the Warchild compilation. In 2009 Elbow contributed their cover of U2's [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] to War Child Presents Heroes. Garvey explained: [...] "When the band first met each other aged 17, Mark and Craig's father Gareth would lend us his Volvo to get our gear around. It seemed that {{for a year and}} a half all that we listened to in that car was Rattle and Hum. I remember the excitement every time a U2 album was released, we just loved them. The first song we ever covered together before we had enough of our own songs to do a performance was 'Running to Stand Still'.
