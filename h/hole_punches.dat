The reason for this was that these artisan produced goods used by the ruling classes as well as offerings to the gods. Michoacán was one of Mesoamerica’s major metal working centers, mastering hammering, metal coating and metal casting by the time the Spanish arrived. Most metal work was in gold, but the Purépecha had developed some copper work. Most of the products were ornaments for the ruling classes but some utilitarian items such as needles, fishhooks and <b>hole</b> <b>punches</b> were made. Luxury goods made with fine feathers was a particularly appreciated by Purépecha society. Goods such as caps, blankets, clothing, headdresses and ornamental staffs adorned with feathers were used only by priests and rulers as symbols of power and dignity. Artisans who made these objects had their own designation, “izquarecucha.” Purépecha stone work includes the working of turquoise and other semi precious stones along with obsidian. Most were used in adornments and offerings but obsidian was also used for agricultural tools of high economic value, weapons and sacrificial knives. Stoneworkers’ graves can be identified by their goods, which included their tools and raw materials.|$|E

Gainsbourg Network Address Translation (NAT) causes {{well-known}} difculties for peer-to-peer (P 2 P) communication, {{since the}} peers involved {{may not be}} reachable at any globally valid IP address. Several NAT traversal techniques are known, but their documentation is slim, and data about their robustness or relative merits is slimmer. This paper documents and analyzes one of the simplest but most ro-bust and practical NAT traversal techniques, commonly known as <b>hole</b> <b>punching.</b> <b>Hole</b> <b>punching</b> is moderately well-understood for UDP communication, but we show {{how it can be}} reliably used to set up peer-to-peer TCP streams as well. After gathering data on the reliability of this technique {{on a wide variety of}} deployed NATs, we nd that about 82 % of the NATs tested support <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> for UDP, and about 64 % support <b>hole</b> <b>punching</b> for TCP streams.

It was created to extend the existing Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) Interchange Code, or BCDIC, which itself was devised as an efficient means of encoding the two zone and number punches on punched cards into 6 bits. The distinct encoding of 's' and 'S' (using position 2 instead of 1) was maintained from punched cards where it was desirable to not have <b>hole</b> <b>punches</b> too close to each other to ensure the integrity of the physical card.|$|E
5000|$|In 1992, a {{young woman}} and {{professional}} paper-craft-artist, Bernadette Chenard, who originally used leather punches and standard <b>hole</b> <b>punches</b> to create shapes from paper, grew tired of {{the sound of the}} hammer pounding to the paper and the difficulty achieving professional results. In search of a solution, Bernadette contacted many die companies in the hope of purchasing some small decorative punches not aware there was none such for home use. Having been repeatedly told that decorative die punches were only used by large manufacturers such as Hallmark, she finally contacted the president of one of the largest die manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and shared her concept and suggestion that making small decorative paper punches available to the general public would prove to be a successful market. A year later the first decorative paper punches appeared on the market and a new generational trend was born.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1950s Rafael {{began work}} on a modern assault rifle in [...]30-’06 Sprg. caliber called the “Fusil de Asaulto.” His design was {{reminiscent}} of the German FG 42 paratroop rifle in that it fired a full-power cartridge and was intended to replace the infantry rifle and submachine gun. However, Mendoza’s assault rifle design was not successful as the Mexican Army later adopted the German G3 series of rifles in 7.62×51mm NATO and produced them at the National Arsenal. The assault rifle was the last firearm design Rafael Mendoza worked on before {{he was diagnosed with}} leukemia. Following a long struggle with this disease, Rafael Mendoza died at age 85 on December 25, 1966.Rafael’s son, Hector Mendoza, began actively working in the company in the 1950s. Following his father’s poor health, Hector took over leadership of the company in 1962. Feeling that military arms were too narrow a base for the company, Hector focused on the commercial market for [...]22 rimfire rifles. Hector designed several models of bolt-action [...]22 rimfire rifles that proved excellent sellers. However, in 1970 the Mexican Government passed new laws severely restricting the private ownership of sporting firearms. Almost immediately Mendoza’s domestic market for rimfire rifles ended, and most of the 500 Mexican gun stores closed their doors. Fortunately, Hector had foreseen that possibility and extended Productos Mendoza’s product lines into office products (compasses, staplers and <b>hole</b> <b>punches)</b> and sporting goods ( [...] knives, bicycles and air rifles). That enabled the company to survive, and today Productos Mendoza continues to offer office products, bicycle parts and air rifles. In fact, the company manufactures 350 air rifles per day for the U.S. market where they are sold by Crosman.|$|E
