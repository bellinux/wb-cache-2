25|$|Too late, Latour-Maubourg finally woke up {{and sent}} two cavalry regiments and four {{infantry}} battalions on a reconnaissance {{to find out what}} was afoot. On the night of the 6th, the French flying column <b>gobbled</b> <b>up</b> a picket of the 13th Light Dragoons. The British lost 52 horsemen captured in this misadventure. General of Brigade Michel Veilande reported that the Allies were across the Guadiana in great strength. Before withdrawing from the area, Latour-Maubourg left General of Brigade Armand Philippon with 3,000 men in Badajoz and 400 soldiers in Olivenza (Olivença). Unaware that Olivenza had such a weak garrison, the Allies laid siege to it on 9 April. The place fell on the 14th after six Portuguese 24-pound cannons blasted a breach in the walls. The same week, Beresford was joined by a Spanish force numbering 3,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry under General Francisco Javier Castaños.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, O'Donnell {{fell upon}} La Bisbal in {{overwhelming}} force. Schwarz had only time {{to send a}} courier with orders to his detachments to concentrate before being engulfed. The troops in La Bisbal withdrew to an old castle which was overlooked by a hill and a church tower. Schwarz held out until evening when he surrendered, after having lost five killed and 19 wounded. While the action in La Bispal was going on, the other outposts were being <b>gobbled</b> <b>up.</b> Fane and Doyle seized Palamós, Colonel Aldea captured Calonge, and Colonel Fleires overran Sant Feliu. Altogether, Schwarz, two colonels, 56 officers, 1,183 men, and 17 guns were captured. The Germans lost approximately 400 killed and wounded. Spanish losses were not reported but were probably light. However, they included O'Donnell who was badly wounded in the foot. He and the prisoners were taken off by Fane's squadron. Schwarz was held in captivity {{until the end of}} the war. He died on 9 October 1826.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the varying}} {{accounts}} and hadiths on {{the collection and}} canonization of the Quran, some scholars debate whether the 'Uthmanic text comprehends the entire body of material that was revealed to Muhammad, or {{if there has been}} material that is missing from the 'Uthmanic text. For example, some Sunni literature contains reports that suggest that some of the revelations had already been lost before the collection of the Quran initiated by Abu Bakr. In one version of a report at the time, 'Umar was once looking for the text of a specific verse of the Quran on stoning as a punishment for adultery, which he remembered. Later, he discovered that the only person who had any record of that verse had been killed in the battle of Yamama and as a result the verse was lost. Later, some of the Companions recalled that same verse, one person being 'A'isha, Muhammad's youngest wife. She is believed to have said that a sheet on which two verses, including the one on stoning, were under her bedding and that after Muhammad died, a domestic animal got into the room and <b>gobbled</b> <b>up</b> the sheet. Experts on hadith literature have rejected this hadith, as all routes of transmission either contain narrators charged with dishonesty in disclosing sources or simply conflict with the majority version of the report, which all have authentic routes of transmission but omit the part about the piece of paper being eaten.|$|E

500|$|... "Enlighten Me", {{released}} in October 1990, {{was the only}} single {{to be released from}} Reverberation. The single fared badly on the UK Singles Chart only reaching number ninety-six, although it reached number eight on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States. The album's release followed in December 1990, and Echo & the Bunnymen immediately went on a seventeen-date tour that focused on the United Kingdom and Ireland. The tour received good reviews, with Melody Maker describing the band as [...] "an object lesson in how to survive and prosper". However, the reviews of the album were not as good. Awarding the album {{two and a half stars}} out of five, Tim DiGravina, who reviewed the album for Allmusic, said, [...] "Echo & the Bunnymen doesn't exist without the distinctive voice of Ian McCulloch". Although he added that the album would have been a [...] "great debut" [...] had the band decided to record under a different name. Bob Mack, reviewing the album for Entertainment Weekly was more forceful in putting the album down. He described the sound of the album as [...] "hopelessly in thrall to the brand of pale pseudo-psychedelia [...] helped popularise during the past decade". He went on to describe Burke and most of the songs as [...] "nondescript". He finished his review by saying [...] "this is a turkey best left to be <b>gobbled</b> <b>up</b> by the band's relatives, close friends, and diehard fans".|$|E

2500|$|A {{string of}} {{favorable}} vintages {{in the late}} 1990s led to an increase of price for Barolos and, in turn, led to increased plantings. Between 1990 and 2004 there was a 47% increase in Nebbiolo plantings in the Barolo zone with [...] under vine. Production subsequently increased from 7 million bottles in the mid-1990s to 10.25 million bottles in the mid-2000s. In the rush to increase plantings some of the less ideal sites previously used by Barbera and Dolcetto were <b>gobbled</b> <b>up.</b> It {{remains to be seen}} if these sites will be able to adequately ripen Nebbiolo enough to produce quality Barolo that justifies the high price of the wine. Some experts are predicting a market correction similar to what was seen in the 1980s when a backlog of vintages caused prices to stabilize.|$|E

[...] In January 1939, the huge Four Year Plan goals combined with a shortage of foreign hard currencies needed to pay for raw materials forced Hitler to order major defense cuts, including a reduction by the Wehrmacht of its allocations by 30% of steel, 47% of aluminum, 25% of cement, 14% of rubber and 20% of copper. On January 30, 1939, Hitler made his [...] "Export or die" [...] speech calling for a German economic offensive ("export battle", to use Hitler's term), to increase German foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such high-grade iron needed for military materials.|$|E
