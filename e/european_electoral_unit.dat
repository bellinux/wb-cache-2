Some larger <b>electoral</b> <b>units,</b> like the cities of Novi Sad, Subotica, Zrenjanin etc., give more (from 2 up to 7). In this case, voters choose between more candidates.

In this case can be interesting to analyze the same phenomenon fixing some a priori relation. First part we are going to present the rationale of these methods. The local analysis aims to eleiminate the effect of geographical position of individuals, represented by a contiguity graph, in an exploratory factorial analysis of spatial data. It will be proved interesting to analyze the electoral results keeping the socio-economic position constant, by means of a similarity graph.
