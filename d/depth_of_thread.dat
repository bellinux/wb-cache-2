The work began with a study of literature focusing on current research within the topic, mainly to create a base of knowledge before the testing was initiated. Studies of scientific articles reveals a lack of research within this area, which makes it difficult to develop standards and calculation models for these joints. The drill holes in the tests have a diameter of 7 mm. The pull-out tests include three <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>threading</b> as well as three fiber directions. Threaded M 8 rods pencilled with glue and without glue are tested, after which the results are compared with each other. Results are indicating a slightly inferior pull-out strength parallel to the grain compared to perpendicular dito. A linear relationship between the pull-out strength and geometry of the joint can be observed, only on rods perpendicular to the grain however. More testing is needed. Prior to the experiments, assumptions were made that most of the glue was scraped off when the rod was screwed in. This appears to be correct since some non glued rods under certain conditions even showed better performance than glued ones. Statistically reliable conclusions can not be made since the quantity oftests in this work is too small. Nevertheless, the results indicates that further testing also on non glued rods is essential...|$|R

Preface In practical production process, machining <b>of</b> internal <b>thread</b> for large diameter can be realized by using lathe tool for internal thread, but this method is difficult to machine internal <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> parts with small diameter, which is usually done by first drilling of base hole <b>of</b> the <b>thread</b> after machining process, and then using tapper to obtain the internal thread manually or with machine. By this traditional method for internal thread processing, the processes are distracted that increases time for handling, loading and unloading.

40|$|High-resolution x-ray {{diffraction}} characterization of pseudomorphic semiconductor device structures is well established, and enables the <b>depth</b> profiling <b>of</b> strain and composition. Recently, metamorphic growth {{has become increasingly}} important for the realization of high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), light-emitting diodes (LEDs), laser diodes, solar cells, and other devices because of the freedom it affords in choosing the compositions and thicknesses of epitaxial layers. However, the traditional methods of {{x-ray diffraction}} (XRD) analysis involving dynamical simulations and curve-fitting to experimental diffraction profiles {{are based on the}} assumption of no dislocations and do not apply to metamorphic structures. The goal of the present work is therefore to extend the high-resolution x-ray analysis to metamorphic structures containing dislocations, using the mosaic crystal model recently developed by our research group. Toward this end, we have analyzed the high-resolution diffraction profiles for a number of metamorphic heterostructures, including step-graded, linearly-graded and S-graded buffers, superlattices, superlattice HEMTs, single quantum wells, and tandem solar cells. We have shown that, in many cases, the widths of primary Bragg peaks or Pendellösung fringes may be used to estimate the threading dislocation densities in these structures. We also show that the diffraction profiles are sensitive to the <b>depth</b> profile <b>of</b> the <b>threading</b> dislocation density, so that in principle {{it should be possible to}} extract the <b>depth</b> profile <b>of</b> <b>threading</b> dislocation density as well as the composition and strain by a curve-fitting procedure.

40|$|AbstractAim of {{this study}} is to examine the {{mechanical}} properties of pedicle screws in titanium alloy obtained by the process of additive manufacturing (Electron Beam Melting, EBM) and compare them with those of screws obtained with traditional techniques. EBM is a methodology able to process metallic powders layer-by-layer. Pedicle screw-produced by the EBM process by the MT Ortho (VS), and commercial screws (VC and VT) were examined. VS screws showed lower resistance to pull-out tests than VC and VT screws. This behavior can be attributed to a lower sharpness and a lower <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread.</b> These features, which may be negative from the point of view of the resistance to pull-out tests, could have positive effects from the point of view of stress concentration on bone. To analyze these effects, fatigue pull-out tests were also carried out and the different screw-bone interface behavior was evaluated using photoelasticity and finite element analysis. The results obtained by numerical simulation confirm what was previously stated, a thread with a geometry less sharpened ensures a better distribution of the loads and reduces the notch effect, allowing a balance of the disadvantage due to the lower primary stabilization. The fatigue limit and fatigue curve were obtained by the thermographic (Risitano) method. Even with a limited number of tests, the thermographic technique allows the prediction of the limit of fatigue and of the whole fatigue curve...|$|E

This research introduces the thread shape factor (TSF) {{as a new}} factor {{for the evaluation of}} TAD mechanical properties. The authors evaluated three TADs for a total of 27 tests: Mini-impianto autoforante (Leone, 1. 75 mm diameter and 8 mm length), Orthoscrew (Leader Ortodonzia, 1. 65 mm diameter and 9 mm length), and MAS (Miniscrew Anchorage System, 1. 3 mm diameter and 11 mm length). For each TAD, the images were acquired via a 20. 00 kV scanning electron microscopy to measure their respective mean <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> (D), pitch (P), and {{the relationship between the two}} (TSF). Subsequently, pullout tests on organic bone analogue were carried out using a testing machine; a crosshead speed of 2 mm/minutes was applied. A two-way analysis of variance was performed to evaluate the interaction between the type of miniscrew and the cortical thickness. A post hoc analysis for single comparisons was subsequently employed. In addition, if homogeneity of variances was not rejected, Scheffè's test was performed, while Tamhane's test was carried out if the homogeneity of variance assumption was not met. Univariate linear regression models were fitted to evaluate the relationship between the outcomes and TSF, D, and P separately. A P value of 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. From univariate linear regression, TSF, D, and P were statistically significant predictors of 'peak load'.

This in vitro experimental study evaluated in 30 different tests with three TADs. Scanning electron microscopy images were acquired for each TAD to measure the TSF; afterwards, the maximum insertion torque (MIT) was evaluated and thereafter pull-out tests on two differently designed organic bone analogs were carried out using a testing machine with a crosshead speed of 2 mm/minute being applied. One-way analysis of variance with group as factor was performed. Post hoc multiple comparisons Bonferroni test was used. Rank-transformed data were used when asymmetry of data was shown. To assess correlation between characteristics, load, and MIT, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was used. A P-value of 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Significant direct correlations were found between TSF and depth and both load and MIT.

40|$|The article {{presents}} an analysis and formalization of existing methods for calculating {{the performance of}} different equipment for mechanical processing of raw materials with screw working body (grinders, mixers, pumps). It is noted that these methods do not consider the presence of counterpressure at the exit, where the reverse flow of the processed raw material is observed. Thus, the calculation of performance (e. g. grinders and pumps) is carried out more simply {{through the use of}} single empirical coefficient linking the design parameters, structural and mechanical properties of raw materials and the value of counterpressure with performance. It is shown that the existing calculation methods are developed for a homogeneous medium using Newtonian isothermal models and that their adjustment to experimental data was carried out by introducing the relevant empirical coefficients. These recommendations are widely used, but they do not allow the calculation of performance based on the counterpressure. The study was conducted mathematically by the method based on the technique of «deployment of the screw channel» {{in the form of a}} rectangle covered by plate (wall of the working cylinder) and moving at a constant speed. The main attention is drawn to the assumption that the screw channel has the form of a rectangle, one side of which is equal to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> and the second side is equal to the pitch of thread. The equation linking volumetric performance with the geometric parameters of the screw, the formula for determining the volumetric performance of the reverse flow and the equation linking the actual performance of the screw with its geometrical parameters, rotation speed, counterpressure and the rheological characteristics of raw materials are developed. The value of performance loss for the screw press is calculated considering reverse flow of meat through the gap. For the first time, a method for calculating the performance of mechanical deboning screw presses is developed allowing to consider the effect of the gaps between the tip of the screw and the chamber, as well as the effect of «sleeve-screw» gaps on the value of the performance loss...|$|E

40|$|Dispensing any fluid {{material}} onto a mixed technology {{printed circuit}} board (PCB) substrate has two basic requirements: applying the material to the exact location required, and dispensing a dot of exact volume. Due to the decreasing pad sizes, and the typical density required in the material pattern, these are major challenges [3]. There are two basic types of dispensing mechanisms that are used for practical production: the Archimedes Metering Valve (AMV) and the Positive Displacement Pump [5]. The performance of the Archimedes Screw in the AMV depends {{a great deal on}} screw design and operating conditions. The principle geometric variables of the Archimedes Screw are the channel depths, i. e., the radial distance between the cylinder surface and root diameter of the screw, the pitch of the screw, the type <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> and the number of channels through which the material can flow. The dimensions of the nozzle, such as the nozzle ID and stand off height, and the rheological properties of the material also influence the parameters required for a consistent dot. Dispensing with an AMV is based on the laws of momentum, fluid dynamics, energy, and mass transport. The amount of material dispensed depends upon the pitch <b>of</b> <b>threads,</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> cut, type <b>of</b> <b>thread,</b> length <b>of</b> screw, the number of starts, and angle of rotation of the screw.
