40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to enumerate various classes of {{cyclically}} colored m-gonal plane cacti, called m-ary cacti. This combinatorial problem is motivated by the topological classification of complex polynomials having at most m critical values, studied by Zvonkin and others. We obtain explicit formulae for both labelled and unlabelled m-ary cacti, according to i) the number of polygons, ii) the vertex-color distribution, iii) the vertex-degree distribution of each color. We also enumerate m-ary cacti according to the order of their automorphism group. Using a generalization of Otter's formula, we express the species of m-ary cacti in terms of rooted and of pointed cacti. A variant of the m-dimensional Lagrange inversion is then used to enumerate these structures. The method of Liskovets for the enumeration of unrooted planar maps can also be adapted to m-ary cacti. 1 Introduction A cactus is a connected simple graph in which each edge lies in exactly one <b>elementary</b> <b>cycle.</b> It [...] ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{flexible}} approach to bus media redundancy in Controller Area Network (CAN) fieldbuses, both {{to improve the}} bandwidth by transmitting different traffic in different channels or to promote redundancy by transmitting the same message {{in more than one}} channel. Specifically the proposed solution is discussed in the context of Flexible Time-Triggered protocol over CAN (FTT-CAN) and inherits the online scheduling flexibility of FTT-CAN, enabling on-the-fly modifications of the traffic conveyed in the replicated buses. Flexible bus media redundancy is useful to fulfill application requirements in terms of additional bandwidth or to react to bus failures leading the system to a degraded operational mode, without compromising safety. The arguments for and against flexible bus media redundancy in the context of FTT-CAN are also discussed in detail. 1 FTT-CAN With Multiple Buses Basis FTT-CAN (Flexible Time-Triggered communication protocol on CAN) [1] has been developed with the main purpose of combining a high level of operational flexibility with timeliness guarantees. It uses the dual-phase <b>elementary</b> <b>cycle</b> concept to isolated time and event-triggered communication. The time-triggered traffic is scheduled online in a particular node called a master, facilitating online admission control of requests, thus being managed in a flexible way, under guaranteed timeliness. The protocol relies on a relaxed master-slave medium access control in which the same master message triggers the transmission of messages in several slaves simultaneously (master/multi-slave). Eventual collisions between slave messages are handled by the native distributed arbitration of CAN. FTT-CAN slots the bus time in consecutive Elementary Cycles (ECs) with fixed duration.

40|$|International audienceWe {{study the}} problem of {{designing}} a survivable WDM network based on covering the communication requests with subnetworks that are protected independently from each other. We consider here the case when the physical network is $T(n) $, a torus of size $n$ by $n$, the subnetworks are cycles and the communication scheme is all-to-all or total exchange (where all pairs of vertices communicate). We will represent the communication requests by a logical graph: a complete graph for the scheme of all-to-all. This problem can be modeled as follows: find a cycle partition or covering of the request edges of $K_{n^ 2 }$, such that for each cycle in the partition, its request edges can be routed in the physical network $T(n) $ {{by a set of}} vertex disjoint paths (equivalently, the routings with the request cycle form an <b>elementary</b> <b>cycle</b> in $T(n) $). Let the load of an edge of the WDM network be the number of paths associated with the requests using the edge. The cost of the network depends on the total load (the cost of transmission) and the maximum load (the cost of equipment). To minimize these costs, we will search for an optimal (or quasi optimal) routing satisfying the following two conditions: (a) each request edge is routed by a shortest path over $T(n) $, and (b) the load of each physical edge resulting from the routing of all cycles of $S$ is uniform or quasi uniform.

The Late Miocene reef complexes from the Mediterranean Basin are characterized by a low diversity with {{the dominance of the}} genus Porites. A coral reef complex dominated by Porites has been recently discovered in the Neogene Messarà Basin (Crete Island, Greece). This basin developed {{as a consequence of the}} extensional tectonics that, starting from the Serravallian, affected the Cretan mobile-belt and gave rise to the formation of the Aegean Basin. The Porites reef complex of the Messarà Basin provides new data to improve the palaeogeographic distribution map of the Mediterranean reefs during the Late Miocene. The coral reef complex of the Neogene Messarà Basin developed in a siliciclastic-dominated depositional system and represents the first occurrence of marine deposits in the Neogene succession of southern Crete. The coral reef complex overlies continental deposits consisting of coarse- and fine-grained alluvial sediments with hydromorphic soils and rests below fine- to medium-grained Late Miocene shelf deposits with molluscs, scaphopods, spicule of sponges, planktonic and benthonic foraminifers. The coral reef complex of the Messarà Basin starts with a reef-building assemblage that consists of subspherical colonies of Siderastrea and Tarbellastraea, together with Porites in massive colonies and some columnar morphs. Above this first bioherm, at least nine low diversity coral reefs have been observed. These latter are mainly characterized by branching Porites colonies and are cyclically separated by coarse-grained fan delta deposits. As a consequence of relative sea-level changes, the coral reef complex of the Messarà Basin developed in a mixed sedimentation system with marked partitioning in the siliciclastic and carbonate deposition. A well-developed cyclicity and a long-term aggradational stacking pattern characterize this coral reef complex. Each <b>elementary</b> <b>cycle</b> starts with coarse-grained delta deposits, which are related to lowstand conditions, and passes upsection to a Porites reef building. The coral reefs grew during relative sea-level rises and highstands, whereas during the subsequent relative sea-level drop the coral reef underwent erosional processes responsible of their truncation. The relative sea-level lowstand condition controls both the genesis of the erosion surface at the top of each cycle and the distribution of the siliciclastic sediments into the basin, advancing the delta front basinwards. In the observed cyclicity of the coral reef complex of the Messarà Basin, lowstand, transgressive and highstand conditions revealed by each cycle show relative proportions that seem to be mainly tectonically controlled. In some cases, the vertical facies distribution within the reef-building assemblages shows higher-frequency cycles (parasequences?) induced by low relative sea-level fluctuation...|$|E

On one hand, Newton's {{law of inertia}} states that every isolated particle has persistent motion, i. e. constant energy and momentum. On the other hand, the wave-particle duality associates a space-time recurrence to the elementary particle energy-momentum. Paraphrasing these two fundamental principles, <b>Elementary</b> <b>Cycles</b> Theory postulates that every isolated elementary constituent of nature (every elementary particle) must be characterized by persistent intrinsic space-time periodicity. Elementary particles are the elementary reference clocks of Nature. The space-time periodicity {{is determined by the}} kinematical state (energy and momentum), so that interactions imply modulations, and every system is decomposable in terms of modulated <b>elementary</b> <b>cycles.</b> Undulatory mechanics is imposed as constraint "overdetermining" relativistic mechanics, similarly to Einstein's proposal of unification. Surprisingly this mathematically proves that the unification of quantum and relativistic physics is fully achieved by imposing an intrinsically cyclic (or compact) nature for relativistic space-time coordinates. In particular the Minkowskian time must be cyclic. The resulting classical mechanics are in fact fully consistent with relativity and reproduces all the fundamental aspects of quantum-relativistic mechanics without explicit quantization. This "overdetermination" just enforces both the local nature of relativistic space-time and the wave-particle duality. It also implies a fully geometrodynamical {{formulation of}} gauge interactions which, similarly to gravity and general relativity, is inferred as modulations of the elementary space-time clocks.
