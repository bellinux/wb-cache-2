5|$|As {{historian}} Dariusz Stola notes, the anti-Jewish campaign combined century-old conspiracy theories, recycled antisemitic {{claims and}} classic communist propaganda. Regarding the tailoring of the Żydokomuna sentiment to communist Poland, Stola suggested: Paradoxically, {{probably the most}} powerful slogan of the communist propaganda in March was the accusation that the Jews were zealous communists. They were blamed for a major part, <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>all,</b> <b>of</b> the crimes and horrors of the Stalinist period. The myth of Judeo-Bolshevism had been well known in Poland since the Russian revolution and the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920, yet its 1968 model deserves interest {{as a tool of}} communist propaganda. This accusation exploited and developed the popular stereotype of Jewish communism to purify communism: the Jews were the dark side of communism; what was wrong in communism was due to them.|$|E

On 1 June 1392, the senate of Dubrovnik decided to send a galley {{to take her to the}} city. Đurađ was captured by the Ottomans in October 1392 and was released only once he agreed to cede Scutari to them. He managed to recapture the town in 1395 but subsequently sold it to the Venetians, together with the surrounding fortresses.|$|E

5|$|To {{ascertain}} {{the meaning of}} the glyphs, Dietrich matched traditional Polynesian names for stars & astronomical bodies with the pictorial representations of rongorongo. This method revealed a high degree of consistency, suggesting that most <b>if</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the glyphs represent astronomical and navigational concepts. Dietrich argues that other researchers have been misled by the literal resemblances of the glyphs, not realizing that they are abstract symbols for the stars (cf. western astronomical symbols). This fits a pattern consistent among many cultures, in which constellations are identified with people, animals, objects, and mythological beings.|$|E
