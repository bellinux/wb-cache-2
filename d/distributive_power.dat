In the MIMO systems, open-loop transmission scheme is used to support mobile stations (MSs) with high mobilities because the base stations (BSs) do not need to track the fast varying channel fading. In this paper, we consider an open-loop network MIMO system with $K$ BSs serving K private MSs and $M^c$ common MS based on a novel partial cooperation overlaying scheme. Exploiting the heterogeneous path gains between the private MSs and the common MSs, each of the $K$ BSs serves a private MS non-cooperatively and the $K$ BSs also serve the $M^c$ common MSs cooperatively. The proposed scheme does not require closed loop instantaneous channel state information feedback, which is highly desirable for high mobility users. Furthermore, we formulate the long-term <b>distributive</b> <b>power</b> allocation problem between the private MSs and the common MSs at each of the $K$ BSs using a partial cooperative game. We show that the long-term power allocation game has a unique Nash Equilibrium (NE) but standard best response update may not always converge to the NE. As a result, we propose a low-complexity distributive long-term power allocation algorithm which only relies on the local long-term channel statistics and has provable convergence property. Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed open-loop SDMA scheme with long-term <b>distributive</b> <b>power</b> allocation can achieve significant performance advantages over the other reference baseline schemes.

In this study, the authors explore equality as a dynamic construct associated with two major processes in mergers of equals: cultural clash and cultural construction. The authors employ a qualitative case study with interviews and analysis of company materials from BroadBand, a wireless Internet access provider, to address the role of culture and equality in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). The results shed light on how and why social actors entering into mergers may enact a culture of equality. First, firms may develop new aspirations and patterns of appreciation and initiate practices and strategies that construct equality {{as an integral part}} of the merger. Second, when distributive equality becomes a liability, it incites change. In the context of equality, this change results in strategic action that transforms the meaning of "a merger of equals" to a more practical, pragmatic, and integrative equality, which takes into account the interests and the needs of the merged firm. Third, contrary to the common skeptical and cynical portrayal of mergers of equals, this study found equality to be a crucial factor during postmerger integration...|$|R

Each mobile has an uplink queue with heterogeneous packet arrivals and delay requirements. We model the problem as an infinite horizon average reward Markov Decision Problem (MDP) where the control actions are functions of the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) {{as well as the}} joint Queue State Information (QSI). To address the distributive requirement and the issue of exponential memory requirement and computational complexity, we approximate the subband allocation Q-factor by the sum of the per-user subband allocation Q-factor and derive a distributive online stochastic learning algorithm to estimate the per-user Q-factor and the Lagrange multipliers (LM) simultaneously and determine the control actions using an auction mechanism. We show that under the proposed auction mechanism, the distributive online learning converges almost surely (with probability 1). For illustration, we apply the proposed distributive stochastic learning framework to an application example with exponential packet size distribution. We show that the delay-optimal power control has the multi-level water-filling structure where the CSI determines the instantaneous power allocation and the QSI determines the water-level. The proposed algorithm has linear signaling overhead and computational complexity O(KN), which is desirable from an implementation perspective.

40|$|Summary. The {{system of}} {{metropolitan}} governance in France {{has undergone a}} series of rather dramatic changes over the past 40 years. Where central cities and their powerful mayors once enjoyed a privileged position over other territorial actors, they now find themselves depending upon these other authorities to fulfil many basic governance tasks. Moreover, a layer of organisations, agencies and networks has formed to co-ordinate the collective action of these actors in areas of mutual concern. The increased importance of co-operation and partnerships in metropolitan governance {{has led to the}} prominence of the concept of functionalist power (interdependency and co-operation) in many of the analyses of metropolitan governance. By contrast, <b>distributive</b> conceptions of <b>power</b> (hierarchy and conflict) have largely been suppressed, weakening the abilities of scholars to account for a key component responsible for shaping the relational space of actors. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a conceptual framework that accounts for both aspects of power, and to use this framework to explain changes in the French governance system. In addition, the paper presents the case of Toulouse to provide a concrete illustration of how local actors have responded to changes in their governance systems...|$|R
40|$|Translating {{knowledge}} of the genome into clinical applications will require the construction of large searchable repositories of phenotypic and genotypic information. These collections of DNA and biological information call for the sustained involvement {{of large numbers of}} research participants, and raise a host of difficult legal and ethical issues. Historically, the commercial value of medical records, bioinformation, and gene patents emerged after the regulatory structures of bioethics came into place. For some bioethicists and policy-makers, the norm of ‘benefit sharing’ has become a necessary corrective for a system seen to facilitate the appropriation of a valuable resource from research participants. While benefit sharing should be applauded insofar as it attempts to submit relations of biocapital to new claims of distributive justice, the project is likely to fail both as a normative and practical matter without greater attention to issues of procedural justice: in particular, the constitution of distributive agency over resources for genomic research. Governance mechanisms in human subjects research are often justified as protections of research subjects from potential harms, but they also tacitly order the <b>power</b> to make <b>distributive</b> decisions over valuable collections of informational, genetic, and social capital. Benefit sharing as a discourse tends to settle political questions of <b>distributive</b> agency—the <b>power</b> to make <b>distributive</b> choices—in ways that exclude research participants from governing the resources they help to create. The notion of ‘partnership governance’ presents a productive avenue for achieving a normative shift from ‘benefit sharing,’ a distributive value, to ‘power sharing,’ a procedural one. If implemented, partnership governance would empower participants to exert a share in distributive decision-making in return for contributing to the economic and social capital of the project. But it would also assign research participants with correlative obligations to other capital partners such as funders and researchers, and duties to uphold the charitable missions of biobanks. Legal principles and forms from within charitable trust law and corporate governance could help achieve ‘partnership governance,’ and address obvious challenges such as agency gaps and collective action problems...|$|R

40|$|Session: Electromagnetic Interaction and CouplingThe Conference program's website {{is located}} at [URL] Presentation: paper no. 430. 3 Summary form only given. The {{intentional}} and unintentional radiations are of great importance to wireless power transfer at the low frequency regime and antenna signal transportation at the higher frequency regime. Due to the rising speed of digital systems and thereby broad bandwidth of signal channels {{at all levels of}} electronic devices, it becomes more essential than ever to quantitively analyze, model, and illustrate how the energy is leaked out and which part is a greater contributor to the wanted or unwanted radiation. However, conventional computational methods seem to be not sufficient to answer these questions. They mostly focused on characterizing port based properties such as matching condition and insertion losses, or gave general efficiency description and radiation patterns. But {{it is not clear how}} the energy is radiated and coupled from different parts of the radiator. For computational electromagnetics algorithms, they blended all physical phenomena together and made the radiation property extraction and analysis not straightforward. In this work, we extend the partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method to distributive radiation analysis so that the radiation and coupling contributions from each segment of the whole radiator can be singled out. Instead of focusing on the conventional circuit modeling method of PEEC, we focus on <b>distributive</b> radiated <b>power</b> and transferred power calculation. To fully stick to the first principle without sacrificing reliability, dynamic Green's function is used throughout the proposed method, not only for the coupling term, but also for the self term. A great significance of this work is that it can help to provide eligible lossy model of antenna structures and meta surfaces more accurately, which avoids approximations and curve fitting methods frequently used in RF and microwave engineering designs to make the circuit model more physical. For example, we can benchmark the idea through the coupling and radiation- mechanism of arbitrarily electrical radiators and magnetic radiators. The radiated power and coupled power between coupled structure will be systematically calculated and analyzed using the proposed method. It gives much more insights than the conventional radiation impedance concept. This work was supported in part by Hong Kong GRF 713011, GRF 712612, and NSFC 61271158. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Currently {{available}} political theories all fail {{to explain}} the nature or justification of territorial claims. My dissertation fills these gaps. In chapter one I distinguish between property and territory, explaining the inapplicability of property theories to territorial claims. Chapter two raises a challenge to egalitarian and cosmopolitan theories of global justice. The central claim of the chapter is that local democracy {{is an essential part}} of global justice, but that cosmopolitan theories cannot give due weight to local democracy. In addition, cosmopolitan theories are not entitled to the conception of equality or distributive justice to which they appeal; their failure in this respect is due to their failure to consider the distribution of land, which scuttles comparability and, with it cosmopolitan distribution principles. In contrast, there is good reason to think that a turn toward effective localized governance would promote democracy and the quality of life of all people. Chapters three, four, and five constitute the core of the dissertation. Chapter three isolates the particular sort of claim I hope to elucidate: prima facie primary rights to territory. Chapter three also defines what I call the "problem of relevance": the problem of finding political principles that could even speak to the issue of connecting peoples to places. Such principles are not forthcoming from mainstream political philosophy. Chapter four solves this problem with a geographically influenced conception of cultures. Chapter five defends the value of cultures so conceived, by arguing that stable cultural membership is an important component of individual freedom, and so merits protection and promotion through political and economic institutions. Finally, chapter six aims to situate the theory of prima facie primary rights to territory within the context of an "internationalist" theory of global justice. Such a theory takes from cosmopolitan theories a sophistication about global institutions and their effects on <b>distributive</b> schemes and <b>power</b> relations. But the theory also takes from culture-based theories an appreciation for the value of communal life and local, grassroots control of the institutions under which we live...|$|R

The economic development of {{a large portion of}} India’s population depends on the success of decentralized energy distribution. This development will help provide the means to eradicate poverty. Ensuring the success of these systems requires {{a closer look at the}} rural energy ladder. One must go beyond just lighting in order to establish a paradigm for integrated sustainable energy independence for India’s rural villages. Whether India decides to power its villages through grid-fed coal power or through decentralized renewable energy systems, this decision has major implications for global climate change. This study assesses the benefits and drawbacks of one such <b>distributive</b> <b>power</b> system: solar home lighting...|$|E

40|$|In biology, economics, and politics, <b>distributive</b> <b>power</b> {{is the key}} for {{understanding}} asymmetrical relationships {{and it can be}} obtained by force (dominance) or trading (leverage). Whenever males cannot use force, they largely depend on females for breeding opportunities and the balance of power tilts in favour of females. Thus, males are expected not only to compete within their sex-class but also to exchange services with the opposite sex. Does this mating market, described for humans and apes, apply also to prosimians, the most ancestral primate group? To answer the question, we studied a scent-oriented and gregarious lemur, Propithecus verreauxi (sifaka), showing female dominance, promiscuous mating, and seasonal breeding. We collected 57 copulations involving 8 males and 4 females in the wild (Berenty Reserve, South Madagascar), and data (all occurrences) on grooming, aggressions, and marking behaviour. We performed the analyses via exact Spearman and matrix correlations. Male mating priority rank correlated with the frequency of male countermarking over female scents but not with the proportion of fights won by males over females. Thus, males competed in an olfactory tournament more than in an arena of aggressive encounters. The copulation frequency correlated neither with the proportion of fights won by males nor with the frequency of male countermarking on female scents. Male-to-female grooming correlated with female-to-male grooming only during premating. Instead, in the mating period male-to-female grooming correlated with the copulation frequency. In short, the biological market underwent seasonal fluctuations, sinc...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In a {{wireless}} network with multihop transmissions and interference-limited link rates, can we balance power {{control in the}} physical layer and congestion control in the transport layer to enhance the overall network performance while maintaining the architectural modularity between the layers? We answer this question by presenting a <b>distributive</b> <b>power</b> control algorithm that couples with existing TCP protocols to increase end-to-end throughput and energy efficiency of the network. Under the rigorous framework of nonlinearly constrained utility maximization, we prove the convergence of this coupled algorithm to the global optimum of joint power control and congestion control, for both synchronized and asynchronous implementations. The rate of convergence is geometric and a desirable modularity between the transport and physical layers is maintained. In particular, when congestion control uses TCP Vegas, a simple utilization in the physical layer of queuing delay information suffices to achieve the joint optimum. Analytic results and simulations illustrate other desirable properties of the proposed algorithm, including robustness to channel outage and to path loss estimation errors, and flexibility in trading-off performance optimality for implementation simplicity. This paper presents a step towards a systematic understanding of ‘layering ’ as ‘optimization decomposition’, where the overall communication network is modelled by a generalized network utility maximization problem, each layer corresponds to a decomposed subproblem, and the interfaces among layers are quantified as the optimization variables coordinating the subproblems. In {{the case of the}} transport and physical layers, link congestion prices {{turn out to be the}} optimal ‘layering prices’...|$|E
