50|$|Bottom Dollar Food was Food Lion's {{discount}} grocery {{model that}} focuses on offering a limited selection of both national brands and private label products. These stores had no bakeries or delis and more items were packaged. Customers bought the bags used to sack their own groceries at Bottom Dollar Food. Stores also used alternative display and stocking techniques such as cut cases on shelves, and using pallets and <b>dump</b> <b>bins</b> to reduce costs. Food Lion opened the first Bottom Dollar Food model in High Point, North Carolina, on September 21, 2005.|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{handling}} harvested {{apples and pears}} changed dramatically between 1955 and 1965 with immersion dumping in packinghouses replacing the picking lug and dry dumping. In immersion <b>dumping,</b> <b>bins</b> of fruit are car-ried into a tank on a chain or track. As the bin submerges, the fruit floats out and onto a packing machine. The empty bins are stacked to one side as {{they come out of}} the tank. Dumping apples in water works well because their specific gravity is much less than 1. 00 (22). Although the specific gravity of pears generally is close to 1. 00, they do not float as desired in water. Early experiences of packers showed it was neces-sary to add salts to the dump tank water to hel...|$|R

40|$|Comparative {{tests of}} 4 systems for {{harvesting}} vineyard pruning residues {{were carried out}} using 1) a square baler; 2) a round baler; 3) a comminuter (or shredder) with drop-down re-usable containers (big bags); 4) a comminuter with built-in <b>dumping</b> <b>bin.</b> All machines were light enough for towing or carrying behind compact vineyard tractors. The machines were tested in Central Italy, on 10 ha of hill vineyard, with slope gradients ranging from 20 to 35 %. The tests included forwarding the processed residue to a central storage place 3 km away. Harvesting-processing productivity ranged from 1. 1 to 1. 7 t per scheduled machine hour (SMH), including all delays. Calculated harvesting-processing costs varied between 19. 7 and 32. 3 € t- 1, but increased from 53. 0 and 105. 2 € t- 1 when forwarding the residues to a central collection point was included. The additional cost of residue management could amount to about 25 € t- 1 (50 € ha- 1 for 2 t ha- 1). The commercial viability of recovering vineyard pruning residue also depends on the eventual redistribution of the savings accrued on residue management. The studied systems offered different products: systems 1 and 2 produced bales, which are easier to store, but are not suited for the feeding of automated furnaces, unless they are further processed into chips. However, systems 3 and 4 produced chips, which {{are more difficult to}} store but can be fed to automated furnaces without any further processing. © 2009 IAgrE...|$|R

30|$|The same {{situation}} applies to Coconut (Cocos Nucifera) which is cultivated in abundance {{along the coast}} line of many countries because it prospers in sandy, saline soil and in tropical climates and {{is a source of}} exchange earnings from export particularly in Nigeria. When coconuts are harvested, the husks are removed, thereby leaving the shell and the copra (meat). These husks are considered as waste materials and are usually <b>dumped</b> into refuse <b>bins.</b> Companies where this copra is used in food processing usually dispose this husk indiscriminately causing environmental nuisance. These materials are then burnt into ashes to produce the coconut husk ash. The coconut husk ash when dried contains cellulose, lignin, pentosans and ash in varying percentage.|$|R

5000|$|Brown bears usually avoid {{areas where}} {{extensive}} development or urbanization has occurred, unlike the smaller, more inoffensive American black bear which can adapt to peri-urban regions. Under many circumstances, extensive human development may cause brown bears {{to alter their}} home ranges. However, bears can easily lose their natural cautiousness upon being attracted to human-created food sources, such as garbage <b>dumps,</b> litter <b>bins,</b> and dumpsters. Brown bears may even venture into human dwellings or barns {{in search of food}} as humans encroach into bear habitats. In different parts of their distribution, brown bears sometimes kill and eat domesticated animals. The saying [...] "a fed bear is a dead bear" [...] has come into use to popularize the idea that allowing bears to scavenge human garbage, such as trash cans and campers' backpacks, pet food, or other food sources that draw the bear into contact with humans, can result in a bear's death. Where attractive bear food and concentrated human settlements overlap, human-bear conflict can create an ecological trap resulting in a lower apparent survival rate for brown bears caught in the trap, as well as attracting additional bears and thereby causing an overall population decline in the area, based on a 20062013 study performed in a southeastern British Columbian valley.|$|R

Sachs never had any of these difficulties. Words and things matched up for him, whereas for me they are constantly breaking apart, flying off in a hundred different directions.

5000|$|In late 2005, Berro was {{identified}} as the bombing perpetrator after years of investigation and speculation into who committed the bombing. According to official Argentine government prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, Hussein's two US-based brothers had testified that he had joined the radical Shia militant group Hezbollah. [...] "The brothers' testimony was substantial, rich in detail and showed {{that he was the}} one who was killed," [...] Nisman added. A U.S. House resolution in July 2004 declared Berro was the suicide bomber, but the identification was not declared positively until November 2005 after Berro's relatives in Detroit identified his photograph. Berro was also recognized with [...] "80 percent certainty" [...] by eyewitness Nicolasa Romero, who saw the driver in the van near the AMIA building. Some Argentine journalists, however, have expressed reservations about these alleged findings; in an op-ed for La Nación, Jorge Urien Berri objected to those who [...] "insist in taken hypotheses as proven when they not", and contested Berro's involvement in the incidents". Berro's two brothers also had denied this version in April 2005 before a US prosecutor, stating that Berro had died on September 9, 1994 during combat in Lebanon. No proper autopsies or DNA tests were done. The police <b>dumped</b> in a <b>bin</b> the head thought to be that of the bomber.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction: - An {{estimated}} number of 40 to 80 new-born babies are being abandoned by their mother in Kampala –Uganda annually. These children are usually <b>dumped</b> into dust <b>bins,</b> on streets, on hospital facilities, in bushes or in pit latrines. Aim:-The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the goals of the organizations/institutions working with child abandonment in Kampala, to find out whom they collaborated with, to examine how the staff working with the organization/institution perceive the women who abandon and issue behind. Furthermore their personal incentives to continue to work with the problem, Method: A qualitative approach was used in this study and face to face semi-structured interview were conducted, since this was the best way to explore feelings, thoughts and attitudes of the respondents who gave answers to complicated questions. Research Questions: What are the main goals of the organizations/institutions and with whom do they collaborate with? What are their major hinders and needs? Do they see any progress? What are their perceptions of the mothers who abandon their new-born babies as well as the issues behind this cruel action? When did the staff became aware of this problem and what are the incentives driving them to continue do this work? Results: The results of the study were consistent with the research namely; the role of the organizations was reported being rescuing of the abandoned babies. First they are taken to the hospital during the first critical hours, thereafter are taken. to children court to get a permission to keep them in the children’s home; or find adoptive parent for these children who can give them love, care and education. Tracing mothers or family members was on the agenda, and in some case eventual re-unification was possible. The hinder which were met by the organization while doing their work were financial resources, misinformation about the organizations in the community, poor flow of information, lack of facilities to accommodate abandoned children, and poor collaboration with the government. Conclusion: The organizations/institutions are doing a good work, but procedures which are used at the moment are unfortunately not enough to reduce the problem. Therefore acute and new even radical approaches are needed to be put into consideration...|$|R
