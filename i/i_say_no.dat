I'm convinced and sure that this war was planned and that the capture of these hostages was just their excuse to start their pre-planned war, but if I had known on July 11 ... that the operation would lead to such a war, would I do it? <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>no,</b> absolutely not." ...|$|E

[...] While Byrnes' colleague, Dianne Butler, said [...] "Sonya's {{wondering how}} long they have to wait before they face the fact there could be something wrong with her. <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> time at all, Sonya. Which explains why she's gardening on her own in those opening credits." [...] When Sonya and Toadie found {{out that they were}} expecting a baby, Claire Crick from All About Soap commented [...] "At last – Sonya and Toadie are having a baby… and we can't think of a soapy couple who deserve such happy news! Not only do we totally love Toadie and Sonya (it's so refreshing seeing a couple who are happy together!), but they're also so clearly desperate to be parents." [...] Crick later praised Sonya for helping Lucas and Vanessa realise their feelings for each other, saying [...] "thank goodness for her meddling ways!" [...] A Newcastle Herald reporter noted that Sonya [...] "has seen more drama than most".|$|E
2500|$|The {{attack on}} the Jesuits was opened on April 17, 1762, by the Jansenist sympathizer the Abbé Chauvelin, who denounced the Constitution of the Society of Jesus, which was {{publicly}} examined and discussed in a hostile press. The Parlement issued its Extraits des assertions assembled from passages from Jesuit theologians and canonists, {{in which they were}} alleged to teach every sort of immorality and error. On August 6, 1762, the final arrêt was proposed to the Parlement by the Advocate General Joly de Fleury, condemning the Society to extinction, but the king's intervention brought eight months' delay and in the meantime a compromise was suggested by the Court. If the French Jesuits would separate from the Society headed by the Jesuit General directly under the pope's authority and come under a French vicar, with French customs, as with the Gallican Church, the Crown would still protect them. The French Jesuits, rejecting Gallicanism, refused to consent. On April 1, 1763, the colleges were closed, and by a further arrêt of March 9, 1764, the Jesuits were required to renounce their vows under pain of banishment. At the end of November 1764, the king signed an edict dissolving the Society throughout his dominions, for they were still protected by some provincial parlements, as in Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Artois. In the draft of the edict, he canceled numerous clauses that implied that the Society was guilty, and writing to Choiseul he concluded: [...] "If I adopt the advice of others for the peace of my realm, you must make the changes I propose, or I will do nothing. <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> more, lest I should say too much." ...|$|E
