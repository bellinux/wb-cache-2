50|$|In 1998, an Alaska Airlines {{mechanic}} named John Liotine, {{who worked}} in the Alaska Airlines maintenance center in Oakland, California, told the Federal Aviation Administration that supervisors were approving records of maintenance that they were not allowed to approve or that <b>indicated</b> <b>work</b> had been completed when the work had not been completed. Liotine began working with federal investigators by secretly audio recording his supervisors. On December 22, 1998, federal authorities raided an Alaska Airlines property and seized its records. In August 1999 Alaska Airlines put Liotine on paid leave, and in 2000 Liotine filed a libel suit against the airline. The crash of AS261 became a part of the federal investigation against Alaska Airlines because in 1997 Liotine had recommended that the jackscrew and gimbal nut of the aircraft involved in the accident be replaced. In December 2001 federal prosecutors stated that {{they were not going to}} file criminal charges against Alaska Airlines. Around that time Alaska Airlines agreed to settle the libel suit by paying about $500,000; as part of the settlement, Liotine resigned.|$|E

50|$|The p-V diagam is a {{simplified}} and idealised {{representation of the}} events involved in a Diesel engine cycle, arranged to illustrate the similarity with a Carnot cycle. Starting at 1, the piston is at bottom dead centre and both valves are closed {{at the start of}} the compression stroke; the cylinder contains air at atmospheric pressure. Between 1 and 2 the air is compressed adiabatically—that is without heat transfer to or from the environment—by the rising piston. (This is only approximately true since there will be some heat exchange with the cylinder walls.) During this compression, the volume is reduced, the pressure and temperature both rise. At or slightly before 2 (TDC) fuel is injected and burns in the compressed hot air. Chemical energy is released and this constitutes an injection of thermal energy (heat) into the compressed gas. Combustion and heating occur between 2 and 3. In this interval the pressure remains constant since the piston descends, and the volume increases; the temperature rises as a consequence of the energy of combustion. At 3 fuel injection and combustion are complete, and the cylinder contains gas at a higher temperature than at 2. Between 3 and 4 this hot gas expands, again approximately adiabatically. Work is done on the system to which the engine is connected. During this expansion phase the volume of the gas rises, and its temperature and pressure both fall. At 4 the exhaust valve opens, and the pressure falls abruptly to atmospheric (approximately). This is unresisted expansion and no useful work is done by it. Ideally the adiabatic expansion should continue, extending the line 3-4 to the right until the pressure falls to that of the surrounding air, but the loss of efficiency caused by this unresisted expansion is justified by the practical difficulties involved in recovering it (the engine would have to be much larger). After the opening of the exhaust valve, the exhaust stroke follows, but this (and the following induction stroke) are not shown on the diagram. If shown, they would be represented by a low-pressure loop at the bottom of the diagram. At 1 it is assumed that the exhaust and induction strokes have been completed, and the cylinder is again filled with air. The piston-cylinder system absorbs energy between 1 and 2—this is the work needed to compress the air in the cylinder, and is provided by mechanical kinetic energy stored in the flywheel of the engine. Work output is done by the piston-cylinder combination between 2 and 4. The difference between these two increments of work is the <b>indicated</b> <b>work</b> output per cycle, and is represented by the area enclosed by the p-V loop. The adiabatic expansion is in a higher pressure range than that of the compression because the gas in the cylinder is hotter during expansion than during compression. It is for this reason that the loop has a finite area, and the net output of work during a cycle is positive.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the main {{geometric}} parameters, operating variables and experimental results of engines with different size and characteristics, as well as simulation predictions at operating conditions for which the working fluid may evidence real gas effects. The concept of dimensionless quasi-static <b>indicated</b> <b>work,</b> introduced previously, is computed assuming both ideal and real gas models. Both values are compared with the Schmidt's model prediction, to evaluate separately how the mechanism simplification and the equation of state affect. The influence of physical gas properties are also analysed regarding the gas circuit performance and mechanical efficiency. Pending of experimental corroboration, some simulations show the possibility of obtaining interesting operating conditions under real gas effects. Semi-empirical equations and experimental correlations are proposed as preliminary design criteria. The ratio between the dimensionless values of the maximum indicated power (a sort of ‘indicated’ Beale number) and the quasi-static <b>indicated</b> <b>work</b> is analysed. The procedure to estimate the maximum indicated power is completed by analysing the characteristic Mach number (dimensionless rotation frequency).

40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that dual-fuel engines at part load inevitably suffer from lower thermal {{efficiency}} and higher emission of carbon monoxide and unburned fuel. A quasi-two-zone com-bustionmodel hasbeendeveloped for studying the second-lawanalysis of adual-fuel (diesel-gas) engine operating under part load conditions. This quasi-two-zone combustion model is able to establish the development of combustion process with time and associated important operat-ing parameters, such as pressure, temperature, heat release rate, and species concentration. The present study is an attempt to investigate the combustion phenomenon from the second law point of view at part load and increasing pilot fuel quantity is considered to improve the above-mentionedproblems. By employingdifferent quantities of pilot fuel, it is found that increasing the pilot fuel quantity increases the work availability and reduces chemical availability of unburned fuels. Also, the results indicate that, compared to the baseline dual-fuel engine, increasing the pilot fuel quantity in about 12 per cent results in an increase of 23 per cent in availability destruc-tion and 29 per cent in the second law efficiency. This enhancement is due to a better combustion progress and increased <b>indicated</b> <b>work</b> when a high amount of pilot fuel quantity is employed...|$|E
