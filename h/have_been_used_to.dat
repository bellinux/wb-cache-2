5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, perhaps, one of {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors that would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E
