We focus {{on the relationship between}} employment growth and migration flows to gauge the strength of the relationship and the stability of the relationship over the business cycle. We find that people move to areas of high employment growth, but that the probability of leaving a region is less strongly related to that region's fortunes. We also find that migration flows to the metropolitan regions of Auckland, Canterbury and Wellington include a higher proportion of international immigrants compared with the rest of New Zealand. employment growth, migration, regional development...|$|R

However, the government of India acknowledged after {{the results of the}} 1991 Census were released that the problems were with quality of services and access. The centralised planning and target-oriented family planning approach had not worked partly because it allowed little innovation or flexibility (Planning Commission 1992). The approach pursued thus far did not stabilise population; quality of health care services suffered and health and contra-ceptive needs of couples remained unmet. Partly as a response, in 1992 the National Development Council set up a committee on population that proposed the formulation of a National Population Policy (NPP). The expert group under the chairman-ship of M S Swaminathan was constituted to draft the populatio...|$|R
40|$|Countries, such as India, {{conduct a}} census {{collection}} every ten years. Currently census in India {{is carried out}} manually with enumerators visiting every household in the country. Being such a vast country (in terms of area) and {{with a population of}} more than 1 billion, manual data collection is a laborious and an expensive process. This thesis proposes a surrogate method for collecting key census metrics using satellite images which help overcome some of the problems such as inconsistency issues, the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) and large temporal acquisition timeframes. Satellite images from the Operational Linescan System (OLS) onboard the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) group of satellites were used for the study. The data processing section of the thesis describes the pre-processing of the census and satellite datasets used in this research and the various data quality issues that were encountered. The next part of the research examines models to propose census metrics from non &ndash; composited fixed gain radiance calibrated images. The next section of the study used the global composite stable light images and brightness images for the year 2001 to propose surrogate census for areas at different spatial scales. Linear regression and multivariate analyses were subsequently performed and models proposed for each of the selected census metrics with results ranging from r 2 of 0. 8 to 0. 9 at the 95 % confidence interval. At Taluks the adjusted r 2 values range from 0. 2 to 0. 8 at the 95 % confidence interval, with the majority of the metrics being moderately correlated (with r 2 between 0. 4 and 0. 7). Generally {{it was found that the}} observed lights and brightness of big rural settlements from DMSP-OLS images have the potential for predicting certain census metrics. Census metrics unavailable at spatial scales lower than districts were also predicted using the proposed models and maps were derived showing the predicted measures. The thesis concludes with a comparative assessment of the models and the utility of the DMSP-OLS night-time images in proposing census. The method proposed in this research will enable prediction of census metrics more frequently and determine the trends of change over the <b>inter-censal</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Various {{studies have}} pointed to the {{persistent}} labour market disadvantage faced by many individuals from minority ethnic groups in Great Britain. Analyses have also shown that minority ethnic groups remain spatially concentrated in particular parts of the urban and regional system, {{and that they are}} over-represented in areas of socioeconomic disadvantage. There has been considerable debate about the skills and spatial dimensions to labour market mismatch, and minority ethnic issues have been given particular prominence {{in the work of the}} Social Exclusion Unit and Policy Action Teams. However, analysts in Great Britain examining the ethnic minority dimension to the problem of labour market mismatch are hampered by a lack of data, including detailed local information on journey-to-work flows disaggregated by ethnic group. This article is concerned with estimating commuting flows by ethnic group in England and Wales, and using these estimates to examine commuting patterns by ethnic group in 1991 in the context of employment change over the preceding <b>inter-censal</b> <b>period,</b> in order to provide some insights into labour market mismatch...|$|E

As part of the action plan the Minister announced that surveys of parental preferences in 44 areas would be undertaken, beginning with five pilot areas in the autumn of 2012. All of the areas to be surveyed under this process fit the following criteria: • Population of between 5, 000 and 20, 000 inhabitants according to the 2011 census • Population has increased by less than 20 % during the <b>inter-censal</b> <b>period</b> 2006 to 2011 Surveys were undertaken on a pilot basis initially in five areas. The surveys were open for a total of three weeks from Monday 22 nd October to Friday 9 th November 2012 inclusive. This report has been prepared for the New Schools Establishment Group regarding the five pilot surveys and the analysis of the outcomes in each area. The report is comprised of this overall summary document and the separate detailed analysis documents in respect of each of the five areas that were surveyed and which are contained in Appendices 1 to 5.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of an exploration into aspects of the residency of the inhabitants of four County Durham mining villages over the period 1851 - 1911. These four villages - Chopwell, High Spen, Blackhall Mill and Victoria Garesfield - were all within a few kilometres of each other and housed the population of a region known, historically, as Chopwell Township. Miners in High Spen and Victoria Garesfield had been working coal {{from the middle of the}} nineteenth century but major developments at Chopwell from 1895 created a new colliery village of over 5000 inhabitants by 1911. This large in-migration created some unusual conditions for this inquiry into residency. The basic data for the analysis was obtained from the on-line versions of seven Censuses (1851 - 1911), supported by parish registers (1890 - 1911) and the 1910 Property Valuation Survey. Generally the ten-year Residential Persistence rates determined for three of the villages are comparable to other published figures, while the ten-year rates of Chopwell differ. It is suggested that the low values found for Chopwell, over the decade 1901 - 1911, were the result of the influx of workers which created a transient period of social ‘churning’ as the migrants adjusted to their new environment. A study of the <b>inter-censal</b> <b>period,</b> 1901 - 1911 for Chopwell and High Spen, revealed frequent short-distance migrations with residents moving between streets. Some of these migrations seem to occur for housing reasons, either up-sizing (for larger families) or down-sizing (for smaller families). A limited examination was also made of the conjecture that the presence of large numbers of children in a household restricted mobility but the results were equivocal. To untangle the web of relationships that develop in communities it was necessary to create Household Histories. This exercise revealed ‘hidden’ illegitimate’ children, frequent re-marriages with surname changes, wider kin networks and some doubtful birthplaces...|$|E
40|$|Intra-urban {{residential}} migrations in le Havre and Rouen, Among the 49. 650. 000 inhabitants {{living within}} the French boundaries in 1968 and considering {{the number of}} deaths which occurred in the meantime, a little more than 21 million inhabitants (i. e. 42. 5 % out of the total population) were no longer living in the same place in 1975. The study of migration levels between communes reveals that only 13 million have moved to another commune and that out of this number 3. 7 million have moved within the same urban area: therfore, during these 7 years, 8 million (i. e. more than 16 % of the 1968 census) have moved within the commune where they had been registered {{at the beginning of the}} <b>inter-censal</b> <b>period.</b> In the very communes belonging to urban areas which count more than 100. 000 inhabitants this proportion nearly reaches 20 % of the 1968 census that is to say 40 % of the national migration. A percentage which should not be underestimated as far as residential migrations are concerned; now, before the study of the 1975 census covering the 1968 - 1975 period, it was almost impossible — at least in France — to analyse these migrations always excepting inquiries which were inevitably punctual or the studying of non-specific data. This period was the first one which it became possible to measure these migrations thoroughly; indeed it shows that in the city of Le Havre more than 30 % of the 1968 residents have moved within the limits of the same commune when less than 50 % had not moved at all, seven years later. For the 1975 - 1982 period, the proportion of intra-urban residential migrants falls slightly, but hardly more than 40 % have not moved at all. For either one of these inter-censal periods, intra-urban migrations have altered the population of the neighbourhoods much more than extra-urban migrations have done it. In Rouen, on account of a different spatial distribution of the urban area and because of its high levels of migration, intra-urban migrations are much more reduced but still, non-migrants are comparatively far less numerous : less than 40 % for the single city of Rouen 43 % for the surrounding communes, between 1968 and 1975. The enumeration of the births which occurred during the <b>inter-censal</b> <b>period</b> — a few of them occurring before the residential migration of the family — the enumeration of the deaths, the reconstitution of the original population: these are some of the restraining statistics which should be overcome at first. Then one should go beyond the literal interpretation of the migration trends, (though it may reveal wide variations) and address to a qualitative study of the migrations: unfortunately when the geographer gets down to the neighbourhoods of the city, the data issued from the census are not easily available which undermines the feasibility of such an inquiry; but still, it would be very interesting to investigate the neighbourhoods where out-migration and in-migration take place so as to determine the role of these migrations upon the observed mutations. Nevertheless, it is possible to determine some of the characteristics of these migrations (their age, their birth and growth rates and when statistics are sufficient, their social status) and to highlight their distinctive features when compared to other categories of migrations. Here we are confronted to an unexplored field of investigation; but still it opens new fields of investigation into the type of residence acquired and into the different processes related to spatial developments in urban areas.

This machine-readable version of John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics {{is the result of}} a collaboration between the Statistical Directorate of the National Assembly for Wales, the History Data Service and the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis at Queen's University Belfast. John Williams' Digest of Welsh Historical Statistics is intended to provide a service for those working on the history of modern Wales. It arises from a belief that the quantitative element is a necessary and important part of the historical record; from an awareness that it was an aspect that was particularly inaccessible for scholars of Welsh history; and from a conviction that some encouragement in the use of quantitative material was necessary. It is modelled on the two volumes dedicated to British historical statistics: Mitchell, B. R. and Deane, P. (1962) Abstract of British historical statistics and Mitchell, B. R. and Jones, H. G. (1971) Second abstract of British historical statistics. Main Topics : The main tables are: Total population and intercensal change by sex by county, 1801 - 1971 Number of females per 1000 males by county, 1801 - 1971 Age and marital condition by sex, 1841 - 1971 Area/acreage by county, 1841 - 1971 Population of Registration Counties as constituted at the time of each Census, 1841 - 1911 Comparative area and population of Registration, Ancient and Administrative Counties, 1891 Parish Register returns of baptisms, burials and marriages, 1700 - 1840 Estimated mid-year population by sex, 1841 - 1974 Estimated mid-year population totals by county, 1903 - 1974 Number of deaths by sex, crude death-rates and infant mortality, 1838 - 1974 Number of births and birth-rates, 1839 - 1974 Number of marriages and rate per 1000 population, 1839 - 1974 Population of towns, 1801 - 1971 Net migration and natural increase, number and per cent for each, <b>inter-censal</b> <b>period,</b> by county, 1841 - 1971 Number born in Wales and living in United States, 1850 - 1970 Number of Welsh speakers by sex, by county and county borough, 1891 - 1971 Welsh speakers as a percentage of total population over three years of age, by county and county borough, 1891 - 1971 Welsh-speaking population by age, 1901 - 1971 Please note: this study does not include information on named individuals and would therefore not be useful for personal family history research. <br...|$|E
