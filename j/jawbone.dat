5|$|On November 12, 2010, {{tourists}} found a <b>jawbone</b> on an Aruban beach {{near the}} Phoenix Hotel and Bubali Swamp. Preliminary examination by a forensic {{expert on the}} island determined that the bone was from a young woman. A part of the bone was sent to The Hague for testing by the Netherlands Forensic Institute. On November 23, 2010, Aruba Solicitor-General Taco Stein announced that—based on dental records—the <b>jawbone</b> was not from Holloway, {{and it was not}} possible to determine whether it had come from a man or woman.|$|E
5|$|When rehearsals {{opened in}} September 1955, Rodgers {{assembled}} {{the cast and}} told them that he was going into the hospital for a minor operation. In fact, Rodgers had been diagnosed with cancer of the <b>jawbone.</b> He spent the weekend before the operation writing one final song for Pipe Dream. The surgery required removal of part of the <b>jawbone</b> and tongue, and some of the lymph nodes. The operation took place on September 21, 1955; within ten days of the operation he was back in the theatre watching rehearsals, though for some time only as a spectator.|$|E

5|$|Diracodon laticeps was {{described}} by Marsh in 1881, from some <b>jawbone</b> fragments. Bakker resurrected D. laticeps in 1986 as a senior synonym of S. stenops, although others note that the material is not diagnostic and is only referable to Stegosaurus sp., making it a nomen dubium.|$|E
5|$|As of 2015, Qapital {{can connect}} {{to more than}} 180 other apps, such as Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Instagram.

The app also allows users to monitor activity among their other financial accounts, such as deposits and withdrawals.|$|E
5|$|Placement of the implant: The implant screw {{is placed}} {{and can be}} self-tapping, {{otherwise}} the prepared site is tapped with an implant analog. It is then screwed into place with a torque controlled wrench at a precise torque {{so as not to}} overload the surrounding bone (overloaded bone can die, a condition called osteonecrosis, which may lead to failure of the implant to fully integrate or bond with the <b>jawbone).</b>|$|E

Several other institutions such as Tokai University and Taiji Whale Museum hold skeletons or skeleton models of Pygmy blue whales, while several churches and buildings in western Japan including Nagasaki Prefecture display the <b>jawbone</b> of captured animals as a gate.|$|E
5|$|The biblical account {{states that}} Samson was a Nazirite, {{and that he}} was given immense {{strength}} to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, including slaying a lion with his bare hands and massacring an entire army of Philistines using only the <b>jawbone</b> of an ass. However, if Samson's long hair was cut, then his Nazirite vow would be violated, and he would lose his strength.|$|E
5|$|The first Devonian {{tetrapod}} identified from Asia {{was recognized}} from a fossil <b>jawbone</b> reported in 2002. The Chinese tetrapod Sinostega pani was discovered among fossilized tropical plants and lobe-finned {{fish in the}} red sandstone sediments of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of northwest China. This finding substantially extended the geographical range of these animals and has raised new questions about the worldwide distribution and great taxonomic diversity they achieved within a relatively short time.|$|E

5|$|The {{lower jaw}} of Dermotherium major {{resembles that of}} living colugos in the {{presence}} of a strong angular process (a projecting piece of bone at the lower side of the back of the <b>jawbone)</b> and a retromolar space (a flat space behind the last molars). The coronoid process (a projecting piece of bone directly behind the molars) rises steeply, with its front wall virtually vertical.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{characteristics of the}} Mérens {{are the result of}} the harsh mountain environment where they live, and they are reminiscent of the horses in the cave drawings at Niaux, made some 13,000 years ago.

Modern digs in Tahiti and the other Society Islands have uncovered few surviving remains of the Tahitian Dog. In 1960, a few canine teeth were uncovered at Ana Paia shelter, on Mo'orea. In 1962, a complete skull, limbs, and vertebrae were discovered at a marae site on Mo'orea along with a <b>jawbone</b> at another site on the same island.|$|E

5|$|The dentary (lower jaw bone) {{itself is}} robust and short. The length {{axis of the}} p4 makes an angle of about 58° with the length axis of the <b>jawbone.</b> The bone is concave on the lingual, but convex on the labial side. There is a {{diastema}} (gap) between the p4 and the incisor {{that would have been}} in front of it, as in the jaw of Sudamerica. Gurovich estimated the length of the diastema as 2.5mm. There is a rounded mental foramen (an opening in the labial side of the <b>jawbone),</b> with a diameter of 0.7mm, located about 0.8mm below the dorsal margin of the bone and 1.5mm in front of the p4. Although the incisor itself is not preserved, its alveolus (the housing of the root) is in part. As in Sudamerica, it extends far into the dentary, passing below p4. The alveolus is 1.5mm wide below the front root of p4 and 1.4mm {{at the back of the}} jaw fragment. Although the height of the alveolus cannot be determined because the lower side is broken away, the incisor must have been quite deep.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower jaw}} was slender {{and had no}} mandibular fenestra, {{a hole in the}} side of the lower <b>jawbone</b> {{commonly}} seen in archosaurs. The teeth were small but sharp, suited for its diet of small vertebrates and possibly other small animals, such as insects. Its frontmost teeth (those on the premaxilla) were unserrated, unlike those further back in the jaw which were flattened and more strongly recurved. Scientists have used these dental characteristics to identify Compsognathus and its closest relatives. Reisdorf and Wuttke (2012) described the taphonomical phenomena of the German specimen of Compsognathus.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is {{long and}} low. The coronoid process, the frontmost of the three main processes (projections) {{at the back of}} the <b>jawbone,</b> is large and about as high as the condyloid process behind it. The angular process, below the condyloid, is fairly short and does not extend further backwards than the condyloid. There is no noticeable capsular process (a raising {{at the back of the}} jaw that houses the root of the lower incisor).|$|E

5|$|The modern {{dromedary}} probably {{evolved in}} the hotter, arid regions of western Asia from the Bactrian camel, which in turn was {{closely related to the}} earliest Old World camels. This hypothesis is supported {{by the fact that the}} dromedary foetus has two humps, while in the adult male an anterior vestigial hump is present. A <b>jawbone</b> of a dromedary that dated from 8,200 BC was found in Saudi Arabia on the southern coast of the Red Sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, a {{complete}} prehistorical skeleton found in Portugal, the Lapedo child, had features of both anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals. Some ancient human skulls with especially large nasal cavities and unusually shaped braincases represent human-Neanderthal hybrids. A 37,000- to 42,000-year-old human <b>jawbone</b> found in Romania's Oase cave contains traces of Neanderthal ancestry from only {{four to six}} generations earlier. All genes from Neanderthals in the current human population are descended from Neanderthal fathers and human mothers. A Neanderthal skull unearthed in Italy in 1957 reveals Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA, which is passed on through only the maternal lineage, but the skull has a chin shape similar to modern humans. It is proposed {{that it was the}} offspring of a Neanderthal mother and a human father.|$|E
5|$|On the mandible, the {{diastema}} is {{very large}} and the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 forward to a point in front of p4, below the mental foramen, {{an opening in the}} <b>jawbone.</b> In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only reaches {{to the level of the}} front root of p4. The mental foramen is very small and opens in the diastema, near the ventral shelf of the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal shelf. Further foramina are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth.|$|E
