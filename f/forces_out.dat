5|$|Bagramyan's {{experience}} in military planning as a {{chief of staff}} allowed him to distinguish himself as a capable commander {{in the early stages}} of the Soviet counter-offensives against Nazi Germany. He was given his first command of a unit in 1942, and in November 1943 received his most prestigious command as the commander of the 1st Baltic Front. As commander of the Baltic Front, he participated in the offensives which pushed German <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of the Baltic republics.|$|E
5|$|By 1944 the Red Army {{had begun}} to push the German <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of Eastern Europe, and the Einsatzgruppen retreated {{alongside}} the Wehrmacht. By late 1944, most Einsatzgruppen personnel had been folded into Waffen-SS combat units or transferred to permanent death camps. Hilberg estimates that between 1941 and 1945 the Einsatzgruppen and related agencies killed {{more than two million}} people, including 1.3 million Jews. The total number of Jews murdered during the war is estimated at 5.5 to six million people.|$|E
5|$|Congolese {{soldiers}} of the Force Publique were involved in fighting with Italian forces during the East African Campaign and were instrumental to forcing Italian <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of Abyssinia, suffering 500 casualties. 13,000 Congolese troops served under British command in Nigeria. Detachments of Congolese soldiers also served in the Middle East and Burma. In total, the Force Publique comprised approximately 40,000 men and was racially segregated meaning that blacks could not become officers. Throughout the war, therefore, it was commanded by white officers.|$|E
50|$|Kashiwado's favoured kimarite or {{techniques}} were migi-yotsu (a left hand outside, right hand inside {{grip on the}} opponents mawashi), yorikiri (<b>force</b> <b>out)</b> and tsukidashi (thrust out). In all, about sixty percent of his wins were by either <b>force</b> <b>out</b> or <b>force</b> <b>out</b> and down (yoritaoshi).|$|R

5|$|In September 1948 Rijadi was {{promoted}} and given control of four battalions {{of soldiers and}} one of student soldiers. Two months later, the Dutch launched a second attack, this time on the nearby city of Yogyakarta (then serving as the nation's capital). Although Rijadi and his troops launched attacks on Dutch forces approaching Solo through Klaten, ultimately the Dutch soldiers entered the city. Applying a divide and conquer policy, Rijadi was able to drive the <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> in four days.|$|E
5|$|On May 4 Peng's forces {{attacked}} {{an isolated}} supply depot in northeast Shaanxi, arrested its commander, and captured food reserves, 40,000 army uniforms, {{and a collection}} of arms that included over a million pieces of artillery. Peng's forces were pushed back to the border of Inner Mongolia, but finally managed to decisively defeat Hu's forces in August, in the Battle of Shajiadian(沙家店战役), saving Mao and other members from the Central committee from being taken prisoner. Peng eventually pushed Kuomintang <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of Shaanxi in February 1948.|$|E
5|$|The JNA intervened {{directly}} against Croatia for {{the first}} time on 3 July 1991, driving Croatian <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of Baranja, north of the city of Osijek, and out of Erdut, Aljmaš and Dalj east of Osijek. The advance was followed by intermittent fighting around Osijek, Vukovar and Vinkovci. At several points, JNA positions approached to within several hundred yards of Osijek city limits.|$|E

50|$|The Official Baseball Rules {{hold that}} if the third out of an inning is a <b>force</b> <b>out</b> of a runner {{advancing}} to any base then, even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that <b>force</b> <b>out</b> is made, his run does not count. But if the third out is not a <b>force</b> <b>out,</b> but a tag out, then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made, his run will count.|$|R
5|$|The brigade was {{deployed}} to the North African Campaign in 1942, participating in Operation Torch, where it conducted its first amphibious assault, and earning the brigade its first campaign streamer for the battle around Algeria and French Morocco. It would continue supporting Allied units as they pushed Axis <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of North Africa during the Tunisia Campaign.|$|E
5|$|While on the Western Front, the 7th Division {{did not see}} {{action at}} full divisional strength, though its {{infantry}} and reconnaissance elements did engage German forces. On 11 October 1918, it first came under shell fire and later, at Saint-Mihiel, came under chemical attack. Elements of the 7th probed up toward Prény near the Moselle River, capturing positions and driving German <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of the region. It was {{at this time that}} the division first received its shoulder sleeve insignia.|$|E
5|$|During {{its time}} in France, the brigade did not {{participate}} as a whole in any engagements, though its infantry and reconnaissance elements did engage German forces. On 11 October 1918 the 13th Brigade and 7th Division first came under shelling attacks. At Saint-Mihiel the units also came under chemical attack. Elements of the 7th probed up toward Prény near the Moselle River, capturing positions and driving German <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of the region. It was around this time that the division first received its shoulder sleeve insignia, which the 13th Brigade wore {{as a part of}} the division.|$|E
50|$|No run may {{score on}} an inning-ending play {{in which the}} third <b>out</b> is a <b>force</b> <b>out</b> or on the batter before he reaches first base. Put in other words, <b>force</b> <b>outs</b> count before runs are scored. It is common that a runner reaches home plate a moment before the third out is made by <b>force</b> <b>out.</b> Such a case is routine; the runner doesn't score but is counted as left on base.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{his great}} height Ōuchiyama {{was known for his}} strong and {{flexible}} legs, and his speed. His most common winning kimarite were yori kiri (<b>force</b> <b>out),</b> yori taoshi (<b>force</b> <b>out</b> and down), kotenage (armlock throw) and uwatenage (overarm throw).|$|R
50|$|Stephen Thompson was {{expected}} to face Besam Yousef at the event. However, Thompson was <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> of the bout {{with a knee injury}} and was replaced by Matthew Riddle. Yousef was then <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> with injury, and replaced by John Maguire.|$|R
5|$|James Garfield {{came into}} Chicago as a Senator-elect from Ohio, who had {{represented}} {{the state in}} the United States House since 1863. In 1859, as a Republican, Garfield was elected to the Ohio Senate. The following year, he was admitted to the Ohio bar. He served as state senator until 1861, when he enlisted in the Union Army {{at the start of the}} Civil War. Garfield was assigned to command the 42nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and had the task of driving Confederate <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of eastern Kentucky. Garfield later led an attack with a number of infantry regiments against a Confederate cavalry at Jenny's Creek on January 6, 1862. The Confederates retreated, and for leading his men to victory, Garfield was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in March 1862.|$|E
5|$|The Germans, too, had {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, {{had lost its}} offensive capabilities after countless attempts to break the U.S. First Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders {{a false sense of}} security, believing that the Wehrmacht did not have the strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to flood the valley below.|$|E
5|$|The JNA intervened {{directly}} against Croatia for {{the first}} time on 3 July, driving Croatian <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of Baranja, north of the city of Osijek, and out of Erdut, Aljmaš and Dalj east of that city. During the summer of 1991, the Croatian Serb military consolidated in the territory under its control. In Banovina, Glina was captured from the ZNG on 26 July. That same day, two Croatian police stations near Hrvatska Kostajnica were captured, isolating the town. The attacks, codenamed Operation Stinger, were carried out by the 7th Banija Division, spearheaded by the Knin special police led by Dragan Vasiljković. In the aftermath of capture of the Kozibrod police station, Serb forces committed the first mass killing, involving the deaths of ten captured policemen and seventeen civilians.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was known}} as [...] "white lightning" [...] because of his {{powerful}} tachi-ai and the speed and ferocity of his bouts.

5|$|The first phase, {{known as}} the ‘orange phase’, was {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} because it provided South Vietnamese units in I Corps with a platform to stop enemy attacks, and even attack them if necessary. To accomplish the objectives of the ‘orange phase’, General Trưởng placed several elite combat units such as the Ranger groups and armoured forces on constant combat alert. The second phase, {{known as the}} ‘green phase’, was designed to delay enemy forces and buy more time for the South Vietnamese to regroup in order to stage a counter-attack, in the scenario that enemy forces managed to overcome the ‘orange phase’. In the final phase, or the ‘blue phases’, require South Vietnamese units to secure their areas of defence, then destroy and push enemy <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of I Corps.|$|E
5|$|As a new recruit in the Brotherhood of Nod, {{the player}} {{initially}} performs tasks for the Brotherhood's second-in-command, a man known as Seth. After Seth attempts to deploy the player in an operation against the United States military without Kane's approval, Kane kills him and thereafter issues commands to the player directly. The player's {{goal is to}} drive GDI <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of North Africa {{through the use of}} both conventional and unconventional warfare. In a ploy to secure victory for Nod, the player is assigned to gain control of GDI's space-based ion cannon, and to establish Nod's Temple in South Africa. The campaign ends with the entire African continent under Nod's control, and with the Brotherhood planning to achieve the same in Europe. The conclusion of the campaign allows the player to choose a historical landmark to destroy with GDI's hijacked ion cannon, in order to shatter GDI's public image. Potential targets include the White House, the British Houses of Parliament, the Eiffel Tower and the Brandenburg Gate.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett's party now {{consisted}} of eight Karluk crew members (himself, engineers John Munro and Robert Williamson, seamen Hugh Williams and Fred Maurer, fireman George Breddy, cook Robert Templeman, and Chafe), three scientists (McKinlay, Mamen and geologist George Malloch), John Hadley, and five Inuit (the {{family of four}} and Kataktovik). Hadley, nearing 60 years of age, {{was one of the}} few, along with Bartlett and the Inuit, with experience of travelling for distances over ice. Bartlett sent his <b>forces</b> <b>out,</b> in groups, to blaze a trail and lay down supply depots on the route to Wrangel Island, thus preparing his inexperienced party for the hazards of ice travel. When he felt they were ready for the main journey he divided them into four teams and sent the first two away on 19 February. Bartlett himself led the last two groups from the camp on 24 February, leaving a note of the party's location in a copper drum in case the camp should drift into an inhabited area. The distance to Wrangel Island was estimated at , but the journey proved to be twice that in length.|$|E
50|$|Kinoarashi favoured yotsu-sumo, or {{grappling}} techniques, {{and used}} a left hand outside, right hand inside (migi-yotsu) grip on his opponent's mawashi. His favourite kimarite or techniques were yori-kiri (<b>force</b> <b>out),</b> yori-taoshi (<b>force</b> <b>out</b> and down) uwate nage (overarm throw), and sukui nage (scoop throw).|$|R

The second baseman throws to the first baseman, with the throw {{arriving}} in time to <b>force</b> <b>out</b> the batter (third out). This {{is an example of}} grounding into a 5-4-3 triple play, per standard baseball positions.|$|R
5|$|Buell quickly {{assigned}} Garfield {{the task}} of driving Confederate <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of eastern Kentucky, giving him the 18th Brigade for the campaign, which, besides his own 42nd, included the 40th Ohio Infantry, two Kentucky infantry regiments and two cavalry units. They departed Catlettsburg, Kentucky, in mid-December, advancing through {{the valley of the}} Big Sandy River. The march was uneventful until Union forces reached Paintsville, Kentucky, on January 6, 1862, where Garfield's cavalry engaged the rebels at Jenny's Creek. Confederate troops under Brigadier General Humphrey Marshall held the town in numbers roughly equal to Garfield's own, but Garfield positioned his troops so as to deceive Marshall into believing that rebel forces were outnumbered. Marshall ordered his troops to withdraw to the forks of Middle Creek, on the road to Virginia; Garfield ordered his troops to pursue the Confederates. They attacked the rebel positions on January 9, 1862, in the Battle of Middle Creek, the only pitched battle Garfield personally commanded. At the end of the fighting, the Confederates withdrew from the field, and Garfield sent his troops to Prestonsburg to reprovision.|$|E
5|$|Egypt's {{commitment}} to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the Six-Day War of June 1967, after which Nasser found {{it increasingly difficult to}} maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of Yemen. The surprising removal of Sallal on November 5 by Yemeni dissidents, supported by republican tribesmen, resulted in an internal shift of power in the capital, while the royalists approached it from the north. The new republic government was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani, Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman, all of which shortly either resigned or fled the country, leaving the disarrayed capital under the control of Prime Minister Hassan Amri. The 1967 siege of Sana'a became the turning point of the war. The remaining republican Prime Minister succeeded in keeping control of Sana'a and by February 1968, the royalists lifted the siege. Clashes continued in parallel with peace talks until 1970, when Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic, and a ceasefire came into effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1783, the Kodavas {{erupted in}} revolt against Tipu and threw their <b>forces</b> <b>out</b> of Coorg. In 1785, he marched into Mercara {{the capital of}} Coorg and {{addressed}} them. He showed racial and religious bias by stating that the Kodavas were guilty of polyandry in a speech before a gathering of Kodavas. He mistook the patrilineal patriarchal Kodavas to be a sub-group of matriarchal Nairs. He threatened {{that he would not}} revile or molest a single individual among them, but instead make Ahmadis (Muslims) out of the whole of them; transplanting them from their homeland in the Coorg to Seringapatam. This inflammatory speech with false accusations of polyandry and an open threat angered the Kodavas who thereafter hated Tipu and again revolted against him. Tipu seized nearly 70,000 Hindus of Coorg along with their king, Dodda Vira-Rajendra, and held them captive at Seringapatam. They were also forcibly converted to Islam and received the same harsh treatment as the Mangalorean Catholics. From 1786 until 1789, even the Nairs of Malabar were captured and deported to Seringapatam.|$|E
50|$|Homasho was a straightforward, unspectacular yotsu-sumo wrestler, rarely {{employing}} throwing moves. His favourite {{grip on his}} opponent's mawashi was a {{left hand}} outside, right hand inside position, or migi-yotsu. Yori-kiri (<b>force</b> <b>out)</b> and yori-taoshi (<b>force</b> <b>out</b> and down) accounted for about 45 percent of his career wins.|$|R
50|$|Kenkō favoured {{techniques}} involving {{grabbing the}} opponent's mawashi, or yotsu-sumo.

His most common winning kimarite was yorikiri, a straightforward <b>force</b> <b>out,</b> followed by uwatenage (overarm throw) and yoritaoshi (<b>force</b> <b>out</b> and down).|$|R
50|$|Kushimaumi {{was one of}} the {{heaviest}} wrestlers ever, weighing over 200 kg at his peak, and his great physical strength was demonstrated by his frequent use of the kimedashi (arm barring <b>force</b> <b>out)</b> technique. He also regularly employed yorikiri (the <b>force</b> <b>out)</b> and kotenage (the arm lock throw).|$|R
