5|$|The First Triumvirate did {{not approve}} {{the use of the}} flag created in Rosario, but Belgrano was {{initially}} unaware of that. He had the flag blessed by the priest Juan Ignacio de Gorriti at Salta, on the second anniversary of the May Revolution. When he found out the flag was not approved, he put it away. When asked, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that he was keeping it for a great victory.|$|E
5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know exactly what <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and {{that he and his wife}} owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E

60|$|Further {{than that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say.</b> <b>He</b> just sat upon {{the edge of}} the jeddak's couch and waited.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{was a sort}} of {{dishonesty}} in his kindness. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not let {{you have}} the bitter truth. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not <b>say</b> <b>he</b> did not love you....|$|R
25|$|When Reish Lakish {{would see}} Jews from the Exile {{gathering}} in the marketplace in the Land of Israel <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to them, 'Scatter yourselves.' He said to them: 'When you ascended you {{did not do so}} as a wall, and here you have come to make a wall.|$|E
25|$|Thomist ethics {{hold that}} it is {{necessary}} to observe both circumstances and intention to determine an action's moral value, and therefore Aquinas cannot be said to be strictly either a deontologicalist or a consequentialist. Rather, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that an action is morally good if it fulfills God's antecedent will.|$|E
25|$|Alex's {{death on}} 6 September 2007, at age 31, {{came as a}} surprise, as the average life span for African grey parrots is sixty years. His last words ("You be good, see you tomorrow.

25|$|Barks {{started taking}} various jobs but had little success in such occupations as a farmer, woodcutter, turner, mule driver, cowboy and printer. From his jobs he learned, he later averred, how eccentric, {{stubborn}} and unpredictable men, animals and machines can be. At {{the same time}} he interacted with colleagues, fellow breadwinners who had satirical disposition towards even their worst troubles. Barks later declared that he was sure that if not for a little humor in their troubled lives, they would certainly go insane. It was an attitude towards life that Barks would adopt. Later <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> it was natural for him to satirize the secret yearnings and desires, the pompous style and the disappointments of his characters. According to Barks, this period of his life would later influence his best known fictional characters: Walt Disney's Donald Duck and his own Scrooge McDuck.|$|E

Retreating to the banks of the Nile for seven years, he secluded himself in an isolated cottage, giving himself up entirely to meditation. He visited his family only on Shabbat. But even at home, he would not utter a word, even to his wife. When it was absolutely necessary for him to say something, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> it in the fewest number of words possible, and then, only in Hebrew.|$|E
500|$|In another {{interview}} he added, [...] "It was exciting {{to work for}} him [...] because he was so interesting when he talked about a scene or talked about people.

She described it as [...] "the best ballad she had ever written" [...] and credited it as the epitome of Butterfly.|$|E
500|$|Justice Harlan {{was very}} close to the law clerks whom he hired, and {{continued}} to take an interest in them after they left his chambers to continue their legal careers. The justice would advise them on their careers, hold annual reunions, and place pictures of their children on his chambers' walls. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> to them of the Warren Court, [...] "We must consider this only temporary," [...] that the Court had gone astray, but would soon right itself.|$|E
2500|$|On August 9, 2007, in an {{interview}} with former CBS News anchor Dan Rather that aired on August 21, Bloomberg categorically stated that he was not running for president, that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be running, and that there were no circumstances in which <b>he</b> <b>would,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "If somebody asks me where I stand, I tell them.

500|$|Aubrey and Sherry Lansing, {{who entered}} the movie {{business}} as a script reader at MGM under Aubrey, were struck by a car while crossing Wilshire Boulevard in the mid-1970s. Both were badly hurt and Lansing had to use crutches {{for a year and}} a half. Aubrey nursed her back to health.

In the end, he was right." ...|$|E
500|$|... "My {{favorite}} thing, honestly, is that [...] {{loved the}} fans. He shot the fans {{the same way}} he shot me: with no pretense. No 'Well, she’s put out records and they haven't.'

500|$|Among his Maryland {{teammates}} and coaches, Turner {{earned a reputation}} as an archetypal [...] "laid-back" [...] Californian and for remaining calm under pressure.
