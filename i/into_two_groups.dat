A group of 12 Calder Trophy-eligible players were split <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of six.

5|$|Individual benzodiazepines {{may have}} {{different}} interactions with certain drugs. Depending on their metabolism pathway, benzodiazepines can be divided roughly <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> The largest group consists of those that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes and possess significant potential for interactions with other drugs. The other group comprises those that are metabolized through glucuronidation, such as lorazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam, and, in general, have few drug interactions.|$|E
5|$|Only one Horsa with {{a platoon}} of {{infantry}} from the Staffords landed near the bridge. Its commander, Lieutenant Withers, divided his men <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> one of which swam across the river and took up position on the opposite bank. Thereafter the bridge was captured following a simultaneous assault from both sides. The Italian defenders from the 120th Coastal Infantry Regiment abandoned their pillboxes on the north bank.|$|E
5|$|Organised <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> the Chindits' first {{operation}} (codenamed Longcloth) {{began on}} 8 February 1943. No. 2 Group, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel S.A.

5|$|The {{candidates}} were divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> - one officially {{supported by the}} party and the 'independents' (broadly following the communist party line but not declared members of the party). The latter would be only considered if over half of the registered voters in the district voted against the official candidates; otherwise all seats from the district (on average between 3 and 6) would be awarded to the official candidates.|$|E
5|$|The first {{cladistic}} {{analysis to}} encompass the interrelationships of Hadrosauridae was conducted by Weishampel and Horner (1990). They found Saurolophinae synonymous with Hadrosaurinae, but only separated the subfamily <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> The first group included Gryposaurus, Aralosaurus, Maiasaura, and Brachylophosaurus. The other contained Edmontosaurus, Saurolophus, Prosaurolophus, Lophorhothon, and Shantungosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} using the 256 {{graphics}} tiles on the NES was handled with special programming techniques. The team streamlined the process by dividing the number of tiles <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of 128 and separating them into enemy characters and protagonists. By further dividing the tiles into four groups of 64, {{they were able to}} reduce graphical processing and switch out tilesets to use as background cogs and floor animations.|$|E
30|$|Another {{factor that}} determines {{the group is}} process. The four samples from the Shaoxing WWTP are divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> samples (Group 2 and Group 3) {{in regard to the}} higher {{abundance}} of Proteobacteria in group 2. This might be ascribed to different processes as the <b>two</b> samples of <b>group</b> 2 were from Shaoxing WWTP-I which adopts AO processes whereas the samples of group 3 were from the carrousel oxidation ditches.|$|R
50|$|The {{competition}} was divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>group</b> stages, with a knockout tournament at the end. Before the tournament, 11 {{of the nations}} were seeded according to their 2001 FIFA ranking, while New Caledonia was placed last by default, as {{it was not a}} FIFA member.|$|R

5|$|Tuberous sundews: These nearly 50 Australian species form an {{underground}} tuber {{to survive the}} extremely dry summers of their habitat, re-emerging in the autumn. These so-called tuberous sundews can be further divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> those that form rosettes and those that form climbing or scrambling stems. Tuberous sundews comprise the subgenus Ergaleium.|$|E

5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, peas and corn. Suitable fruits are divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{subspecies}} have been named, of which 12 were recognised in the Handbook of the Birds of the World. These subspecies are divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups,</b> the Palaearctic P. d. domesticus group, and the Oriental P. d. indicus group. Several Middle Eastern subspecies, including P. d. biblicus, are sometimes considered a third, intermediate group. The subspecies P. d. indicus {{was described as a}} species, and was considered to be distinct by many ornithologists during the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|After the six 735kV wires {{split up}} <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> of three power lines each, the HVDC line follows the eastern group, {{and the western}} set diverges away. The line remains {{overhead}} until it reaches {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence River near Grondines, where the 450kV HVDC line descends into an underwater tunnel traversing the river. The power line surfaces on the south shore near Lotbinière substation. After the river crossing, the line enters into the Nicolet terminal near Sainte-Eulalie, northeast of Drummondville. South of the terminal, the line heads south and after a relatively short distance, it enters the Des Cantons close to Sherbrooke.|$|E

North Korea is divided through the center by the impassable Taebaek Mountains, which separated the UN forces <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> The US Eighth Army advanced north through the western coast of the Korean Peninsula, while the Republic of Korea (ROK) I Corps and the US X Corps advanced north on the eastern coast.|$|E
5|$|Coldrum Long Barrow is {{comparatively}} {{isolated from}} the other Medway Megaliths; in this it is unique, given that the other surviving examples are clustered <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups.</b> It is possible that another chambered tomb was located nearby; a razed, elongated earthen mound with an east–west orientation {{is located in a}} hollow {{at the foot of the}} downs just under a quarter of a mile north of the Coldrum Stones. It may be that this represents the remnants of another such monument which has had its stones removed or buried. Several large sarsens south of the Coldrums might represent the remnants of a further such tomb, since destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{experiments}} with colonies of Cerapachys biroi suggest {{that an individual}} may choose nest roles based on her previous experience. An entire generation of identical workers was divided <b>into</b> <b>two</b> <b>groups</b> whose outcome in food foraging was controlled. One group was continually rewarded with prey, while it was made certain that the other failed. As a result, members of the successful group intensified their foraging attempts while the unsuccessful group ventured out fewer and fewer times. A month later, the successful foragers continued in their role while the others had moved to specialise in brood care.|$|E
