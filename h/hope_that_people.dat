25|$|Powell {{decided to}} return to Surratt's {{boarding}} house to seek help. His clothes were somewhat bloody from the attack at Seward's home, and he'd dropped his hat at the Seward home. During much of the Victorian era, it was considered unseemly for any man (even a menial laborer) to be seen in public without a hat, and Powell would have been viewed with suspicion had he tried to enter the city without one. Ripping the sleeve from his undershirt, Powell placed the sleeve on his head in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> would think it was a stocking cap. To complete his disguise as a common laborer, he then stole a pickaxe from a farmyard. Powell then headed for Surratt's.|$|E

500|$|This {{prompted}} showrunner Glen Mazzara {{to respond}} to such criticism. In his interview with The Daily Beast, he stated: [...] "The producers and writers of The Walking Dead are fully aware that the morning-after pill would not induce an abortion or miscarriage, we exercised our artistic creative license to explore a storyline with one of our characters, not to make any pro-life or pro-choice political statement. We sincerely <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> are not turning to the fictional world of The Walking Dead for accurate medical information." [...] The episode itself does not, in fact, claim the morning after pills will work, as Glenn questions Lori over that fact, to which she replies {{that she does not}} know.|$|E

She states that humanity {{was intended to be}} God's crowning achievement, and was prepared to move on after its creation. However, the constant prayers of people on Earth prevent him from being able to do this. For centuries, God has been sending disasters to Earth in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> will stop believing in Him and let Him pass.

2500|$|In 1920, Courtneidge {{presented}} the non-musical comedy Paddy the Next Best Thing at the Savoy Theatre. The reviewer of The Times expressed the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> in Ireland would not {{hear of the}} show: [...] "Ireland has enough grievances to go on with". Nevertheless, the play was a popular success, and ran for 867 performances. Following this, Courtneidge took a touring company to Australia, presenting a repertory of comedies including The Man from Toronto, Somerset Maugham's Home and Beauty, and a work by an Australian author, Saving Grace. Among the company members was Courtneidge's younger daughter Rosaline. He returned to England {{by way of the}} US, where he presented [...] Paddy the Next Best Thing in New York. Alexander Woollcott in The New York Times was no more laudatory than his critical counterpart in London, but the play ran well.|$|E

2500|$|Boehler himself went as {{a missionary}} to Savannah and South Carolina. As part of Zinzendorf's plans {{to revive the}} Moravian Church, Boehler preached {{the ways of the}} {{religion}} to black slaves and Native Americans, as well as white settlers in the colonies. In 1740, after the Moravians were expelled from Savannah, Boehler led the group of Moravians from Georgia to Pennsylvania. They founded the towns of Nazareth and Bethlehem, both of which are still-thriving populous Moravian communities. Boehler was almost a savior for many of the Moravian people in these communities. During times of crisis, he was accounted as the preacher who could restore the peace and <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> were so desperately looking for. He went back to England to organize a new group of people to send to America. This group of emigrants called the [...] "Sea Congregation" [...] traveled with Boehler and settled in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in 1742.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{the second}} Smashing Pumpkins album {{released}} for free over the Internet, the first being 2000's Machina II/The Friends & Enemies of Modern Music. [...] Teargarden is seeing such a release due to Corgan's reported <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> hear the album before dismissing it, {{on top of his}} interest in [...] "subverting a system that works against holistic thinking when it comes to how art is made and delivered to those who might want to hear it." [...] All of the songs were planned to be released for free as 192-kbps, DRM-free MP3 files, available from direct links on the band's website. Finally, a complete box set release is planned that will contain all of the tracks accompanied by an art film and a making-of documentary. [...] Corgan says he is also considering a single-CD compilation of the best of the forty-four tracks.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Screams of Abel webzine, former Antestor member Morten Mageroy reacted with caution to the proliferation of unblack bands: [...] "I really <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> (who play Christian black metal) {{know what they are}} doing. I know this sounds very rough, but I have seen people being pulled into something they do not know. I am not saying that I know that these musicians are going to mess their lives up, but I have seen it happen to some people and it frightens me very much." [...] Mageroy, however, defends the unblack metal bands' intentions: [...] "A lot of Christian bands have done amazing things being led by God. I know that God is using many types of communication, and it is important that Christians is [...] present in every field, in every genre, privately and in work. God might just as well use heavy metal to bring salvation to people." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{eleventh}} episode of Season 10 {{and the first}} of 2013, [...] "Shabbat Shalom", Ziva's estranged father Eli is killed in a house attack, along with Director Vance's wife Jackie. Glasberg discussed the ramifications that would be shown in the following episode, [...] "Shiva", saying, [...] "There's a part of Ziva that's wounded, and broken, and Tony is there for her — as a friend, and as a coworker ... We end up back in Tony's apartment, and there's some really lovely, emotional stuff that happens." [...] He added, [...] "You'll really see Tony be there for her and support her and emotionally be strong for her. It's all the things I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who enjoy the Tony-Ziva relationship will look for."

2500|$|At {{the heart}} {{of many of the}} new schemes was {{architecture}} of poor quality or poor design, and a poor understanding {{of the effects of the}} new road network. As warned by Buchanan, the detailed implementation of many of these schemes critically affected their success or failure. Subsequent research has shown that more is needed than a pedestrian centre with glass shop fronts and a <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> will come and social life flourish. One of the recommendations, that of integrating low level roads with developments on top, has been largely ignored; the costs and commitments needed for multi-level developments have been prohibitive in old town centres, especially when cheaper alternatives or out of town sites have presented themselves. [...] New developments were often made in a fashionable modernist or brutalist style which rapidly dated, while the planners had not fully considered the social or economic factors that could lead to urban decay. The corridor or distribution roads would often have minimal overpasses or grade separation, with communities severed or blighted by noise and fumes. Drivers would refuse to be neatly compartmentalised into [...] "travelling" [...] along the corridor roads and [...] "living" [...] on the local roads, leading to businesses closing outside the prime sites.|$|E
2500|$|Guadagnino has {{described}} Call Me By Your Name as a family-oriented film {{for the purpose}} of [...] "transmission of knowledge and <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> of different generations come to see the film together." [...] He never saw it as a [...] "gay" [...] movie, but rather calls it a film about the [...] "beauty of the newborn idea of desire, unbiased and uncynical," [...] and reflects his motto of living [...] "with a sense of joie de vivre." [...] The director attempted to avoid the flaws he had seen in most coming-of-age films, in which growth is often portrayed as a result of resolving certain preconceived dilemmas, like choosing between two lovers. He also wanted the story to follow two people in the moment, rather than focus on an antagonist or a tragedy, a specific approach inspired by À Nos Amours (1983), directed by Maurice Pialat. As someone who considers sex in film a representation of the characters' behavior and identity, Guadagnino wasn't interested in including explicit sex scenes in the film, {{in order to keep the}} tone as planned, saying, [...] "I wanted the audience to completely rely on the emotional travel of these people and feel first love [...] It was important to me to create this powerful universality, because the whole idea of the movie is that the other person makes you beautiful — enlightens you, elevates you." ...|$|E
