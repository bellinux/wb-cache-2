5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v.

Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception <b>in</b> <b>hospitals</b> <b>and</b> pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto).

The data indicate the importance of hygiene training for parents and the desirability of a ready to use formula...|$|R
