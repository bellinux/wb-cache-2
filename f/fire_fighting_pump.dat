40|$|The {{vertically}} mounted <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>pump</b> used in {{pump house}} generally subjected to mechanical, structural and hydraulic problems. This generates dynamic load and produces vibrations of high frequencies and stresses which affects the pump performance {{and increases the}} maintenance cost. These problems leading to failure and damage of the costly components of pump houses. In this regard vibration analysis is necessary, to detect and diagnose faults of the fire fighting pumping house, to avoid any failure and efficient operation of pump system. This paper presents, the vibration analysis of different components of pump by actual measurement and performance testing at test rig. The vibrations are measured at no load {{as well as at}} full load condition. The defects in different components are identified and balanced. The balancing of the unbalanced motor fan enhances dynamic performance greatly due to decreased vibrations. The two different case studies of old as well as new pump are discussed here. The study becomes the benchmark for erection, commissioning and provides guidelines for fault diagnose of fire fighting pumps...|$|E

5000|$|In 1947 Leon Wosika and Eric Balje set up {{a second}} design line and {{developed}} a centrifugal-flow system that was much more compact than Solar's previous designs. Originally known as the MPM-45, the unit was delivered as the [...] "Mars". The Navy purchased the Mars to power portable <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>pumps</b> on ships and gave it the designation T41. In 1956 the Navy turned to Solar to provide a slightly larger design to power a small helicopter, the Gyrodyne XRON-1. Solar Aircraft Company responded by developing a slightly larger version of the Mars, the [...] "Titan", which the Navy designated the T62. When the Navy abandoned development of Gyrodyne's XRON helicopter, Solar Aircraft Company adapted the Titan for service as an auxiliary power unit. Deliveries of this auxiliary power unit started in 1962. The Navy also had Solar adapt the Titan into a free-turbine version designated by the Navy as the T66, but this unit was never put into use. Solar Aircraft Company designed other versions of the basic Mars design, including the [...] Spartan, and the [...] Gemini.sdwIn the late 1950s, the Navy once again turned to Solar, this time for a larger [...] unit {{that would be used}} as an engine in a high-speed boat. The result was the axial-flow [...] "Saturn" [...] engine, which entered production in 1960. Solar started marketing the Saturn to industrial users needing a [...] unit for any role, and it {{went on to become the}} world's most widely used industrial gas turbine with some 4800 units in 80 countries. It remains in production today in two uprated and enhanced configurations. In order to make the system more attractive, Solar also started the design of various [...] "front ends" [...] that could be purchased as a complete unit with the Saturn. These included gas compressor sets, pump-drive packages and generator sets. These units, especially the gas compressors, are widely used in the natural gas industry as pumping units on pipelines.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the conceptual design {{model of a}} GIS [Geographic Information system] based Utility Management System for DOS Housing Colony, Vikramnagar, Ahmedabad. The processing capabilities of GIS and the system ability to manipulate geo-referenced data and results in different formats and models make them suitable for planning and operation of all activities of the Construction & Maintenance Group of SAC, Ahmedabad. This is specially designed software for the Civil, Electrical and Horticultural wing of Construction and Maintenance Group, Space Applications Centre (ISRO) in many {{ways to improve the}} Planning, Maintenance and Information standards. In this software, all physical information like Vikramnagar area, all buildings, roads, water supply lines, drainage lines, <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> lines, <b>pump</b> house, wells, bore points, recharge wells, and STP plant, torrent power substations, DG set rooms, LT panels, LT cables, electrical light poles and solar light poles, nursery area and trees are converting into digital forms using GIS by developing different layers. Thus Digital information will be used for identification of each utility and finally, this software will provide information of the entire Vikramnagar housing colony related to Construction & Maintenance Group by providing instant records availability. The Utility system load flow based on GIS presented in the paper is an ideal tool for performing the analysis and viewing the results on a map superimposed with other geographic layers. It allows power system planners to work on the real system by relating the output to the location of load and feeder. Together with the utilization of water supply lines, <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> lines, drainage lines, all buildings, roads, trees and power distribution the System will become an essential tool for utility decision makers and the Occupants of the colony.
