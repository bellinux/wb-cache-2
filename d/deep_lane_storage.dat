40|$|Block {{stacking}} storage guarantees high {{storage density}} for end-of-line warehouses in product flow manufacturing systems, which are mostly diffused in food processing and beverage industry. These storage systems, characterized by high volumes per item and limited inventory mix, are organized through storage deep lanes of homogeneous items. Setting the optimal lane depths for the incoming stock-keeping-units (SKUs) influences the overall {{space and time}} efficiency performances, {{as well as the}} layout of the storage zones, the selection of the proper storage modes and equipment. This paper illustrates an original decision-support model to (1) manage existing block storage warehouses, and (2) to aid the design of new block storage systems from green field. The management of a warehouse (1) deals with the assignment of the incoming product lots to the optimal lane depth, storage mode, and zone in a constrained and capacitated storage environment. The design of a warehouse from green field (2) is aided by identifying the optimal configuration of lane depths and storage modes that minimizes the infrastructural costs. The proposed model is formulated via integer linear programming (ILP) and minimizes mutually the costs generated by space and time inefficiencies. The illustrated results obtained by its application to a real case study from the beverage industry, candidate the model as a tool to aid operative and strategic layout issues in <b>deep</b> <b>lane</b> <b>storage</b> systems...|$|E

5000|$|The author Ralph Wightman, agriculturist, broadcaster, {{and native}} of Dorset, {{described}} the village as [...] "a beautiful place of <b>deep</b> <b>lanes,</b> orchards and old houses, with a church of quiet charm", and, {{in a similar}} vein, Sir Frederick Treves in 1906 considered it [...] "as pretty a village as any in Dorset".|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a parking system for motor vehicles, in which several satellite vehicles (8) for loading and unloading parking places (9) can move in <b>storage</b> <b>lanes</b> (2) through <b>storage</b> aisles. The satellite vehicles can basically travel horizontally in both directions in the <b>storage</b> <b>lanes</b> (2). At each end of a <b>storage</b> <b>lane</b> (2) is a vertical conveyor (10, 11) provided for conveying empty or loaded satellite vehicles (8) from the transfer level to the parking level and vice versa, whereby each vertical conveyor (10, 11) can only transport the satellite vehicles (8) in one direction while the parking system is operating. The movements of the vertical conveyors 10, 11) and the satellite vehicles (8) are simultaneous and independent {{of each other in}} relation to a parking level and a <b>storage</b> <b>lane...</b>|$|R

60|$|I {{remembered how}} I searched among <b>deep</b> <b>lanes,</b> beyond {{rows and rows}} of ancient hedgerow elms, and how I found its little church and {{thatched}} cottages at last, covered with ivy and roses and creepers, all in a white and pink cloud of apple blossoms. Searching for it had been great fun and finding it a delightful experience; why not have the pleasure once more now that it was May again and the apple orchards in blossom? No sooner had I asked myself the question than I was on my bicycle among those same <b>deep</b> <b>lanes,</b> with the unkept hedges and the great hedgerow elms shutting out a view of the country, searching once more for the village of Clyst Hyden. And as on the former occasion, years ago it seemed, I would not enquire my way of anyone. I had found it then for myself and was determined to do so again, although I had set out with the vaguest idea as to the right direction.|$|R
60|$|The {{ride was}} a {{delightful}} one to Leigh. He had only once visited the chateau before, {{and then only}} {{for a day or}} two. The wild country, with its <b>deep</b> <b>lanes,</b> its thick high hedges, its woods and copses, was all new to him; for the country round his English home was, for the most part, bare and open. Some of the peasants carried guns over their shoulders, and looked as if accustomed to use them.|$|R
60|$|At length, after {{stumbling}} {{through a}} labyrinth of dark and <b>deep</b> <b>lanes,</b> and crossing more than one rough and barren heath, we found ourselves {{on the edge of}} a highroad, where a chaise and four awaited, as it appeared, our arrival. To my great relief, we now changed our mode of conveyance; for my dizziness and headache had returned in so strong a degree, that I should otherwise have been totally unable to keep my seat on horseback, even with the support which I received.|$|R

60|$|The nocturnal {{adventures of}} Gurth {{were not yet}} concluded; indeed he himself became partly of that mind, when, after passing one or two straggling houses which stood in the {{outskirts}} of the village, he found himself in a <b>deep</b> <b>lane,</b> running between two banks overgrown with hazel and holly, while here and there a dwarf oak flung its arms altogether across the path. The lane was moreover much rutted and broken up by the carriages which had recently transported articles of various kinds to the tournament; and it was dark, for the banks and bushes intercepted the light of the harvest moon.|$|R
50|$|Coronation Oak green {{today is}} {{all that remains of}} the {{original}} village green at the centre of the village. It was once the crossroads where Linersh-lane, the road from Wonersh, met <b>Deep</b> <b>Lane,</b> the original route from Wintershall, and the first Mill Lane (moved in the 1820s), which started from {{the north side of the}} house now called 'Saddlers', which was previously known as 'Corners' or 'Old Corners'. There is a reference to a moated manor house near the village green, which would probably have dated from the 14th century; it survived to the early 19th century.|$|R

50|$|The {{style of}} hedge used in Devon, Cornwall {{and parts of}} Wales gives us the {{familiar}} <b>deep</b> Devon <b>lanes.</b> However, in reality they are seldom particularly deep - but rather what they do have are high banks, which {{give the impression of}} depth.|$|R
60|$|This {{was in the}} tract {{surrounding}} the Loire, the south of which is now called La Vendee, and was then termed the Bocage, or the Woodland. It is full of low hills and narrow valleys, divided into small fields, enclosed by high thick hedgerows; so that when viewed {{from the top of}} one of the hills, the whole country appears perfectly green, excepting near harvest-time, when small patches of golden corn catch the eye, or where here and there a church tower peeps above the trees, {{in the midst of the}} flat red-tiled roofs of the surrounding village. The roads are <b>deep</b> <b>lanes,</b> often in the winter beds of streams, and in the summer completely roofed by the thick foliage of the trees, whose branches meet overhead.|$|R
60|$|Silence fell, {{broken only}} by the snoring of Smith. Billie was {{thinking}} of Sam, and of what Sam had said to her in the lane yesterday; of his clean-cut face, and the look in his eyes--so vastly superior to any look that ever came into the eyes of Bream Mortimer. She was telling herself that her relations with Sam were an idyll; for, being young and romantic, she enjoyed this freshet of surreptitious meetings which had come to enliven the stream of her life. It was pleasant to go warily into <b>deep</b> <b>lanes</b> where forbidden love lurked. She cast a swift side-glance at her father--the unconscious ogre in her fairy-story. What would he say if he knew? But Mr. Bennett did not know, and consequently continued to meditate peacefully on ham.|$|R
60|$|Before another {{quarter of}} an hour had passed, they were driving through the <b>deep</b> <b>lanes,</b> the long grass thickly laden with morning dew, which beaded the webs of the spiders and rose in clouds of mist under the {{influence}} of the sun's rays. There was stillness in the air at first, then the morning sounds, the labourer going forth, the world wakening to life, the opening houses, the children coming out to school. In spite of the tumult of feeling, Norman could not but be soothed and refreshed by the new and fair morning scene, and both minds quitted the school politics, as Dr. May talked of past enjoyment of walks or drives home in early dawn, the more delicious after a sad watch in a sick-room, and told of the fair sights he had seen at such unwonted hours.|$|R
60|$|Eating a {{piece of}} rye-bread as she went, Eustacie, in her gray cloak, rode under Martin's {{guardianship}} along the <b>deep</b> <b>lanes,</b> just budding with spring, in the chill dewiness before sunrise. She was silent, and just a little sullen, for she had found stout shrewd Martin less easy to talk over than the admiring Blaise, and her spirit was excessively chafed by the tardiness of her retainers. But the sun rose and cleared away all clouds of temper, the cocks crew, the sheep bleated, and fresh morning sounds met her ear, and seemed to cheer and fill her with hope; and in some compunction for her want of graciousness, she thanked Martin, and praised his ass with a pretty cordiality that would have fully compensated for her displeasure, even if the honest man had been sensible of it.|$|R
50|$|The Dartmoor Way is {{a long-distance}} {{footpath}} and cycle route centred on the Dartmoor National Park in southern Devon, England.

50|$|Originally a small fishing town, the {{presence}} of a <b>deep</b> sea <b>lane</b> with year-round minimum depth of 17 meters stretching along the coast of Beilun motivated the Chinese Government to build one of the nation's largest deep sea port here.

60|$|However, an {{occasional}} bugle note, {{clouds of dust}} on the road far below in the valley, and a low, dull tramp warned them to come forward, and station themselves in the hedge above the <b>deep</b> <b>lane</b> where Steadfast had once watched for his brother. Only {{a few of the}} more adventurous village lads were before them now, and when Stead explained that the little wench wanted to watch for her father, they were kind in helping him to perch her in the hollow of a broken old pollard, where she could see, and not be seen. For the poor camp maiden knew the need of caution. She drew Steadfast close to her, and bade him not show himself till she told him, for some of the wilder sort would blaze away their pistols at anything, especially when they had had any good ale, or were out of sorts.|$|R
40|$|An {{optimisation}} {{model for the}} sustainable design of refrigerated automated storage and retrieval systems is proposed, which takes into account specific features of the food supply chain, such as temperature control. Rack configuration as well as surfaces and volumes of the cold cell are conjointly optimised in order to minimise the total yearly cost of the automated storage facility, introducing energy requirements both for refrigeration and picking operations explicitly, other than investment costs. Crane plus satellite systems are modelled in order to enable <b>deep</b> <b>lane</b> solutions and space savings, as suitable for cold storage. The model allows a deep analysis {{of the impact of}} supply chain decision variables, such as the facility location, the storage temperature and the incoming product temperature on costs, energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, so that storage facilities attributes for supply chain design models can be properly assessed to re-optimise the whole cold chain. The design problem is modelled and solved by Constraint Programming in order to easily manage non-linear functions...|$|R

60|$|Indeed, the Vendean {{fidelity}} {{has often}} been tested, and she made full proof of it among the lanes, copses, and homesteads of her own broad lands. The whole country was a network of <b>deep</b> <b>lanes,</b> sunk between impenetrable hedgerows, inclosing small fields, orchards, and thickets, and gently undulating in low hills and shallow valleys, interspersed with tall wasp-waisted windmills airily waving their arms {{on the top of}} lofty masts. It was partitioned into small farms, inhabited by a simple-hearted peasantry, religious and diligent, with a fair amount of rural wealth and comfort. Their love for their lords was loyally warm, and Eustacie monopolized it, from their detestation of her uncle's exactions; they would risk any of the savage punishments with which they were threatened for concealing her; and as one by one it was needful to take them into the secret, so as to disarm suspicion, and she was passed from one farm to another, each proved his faithful attachment, and though himself repaid by her thankful smile and confiding manner.|$|R
60|$|The wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through <b>deep</b> <b>lanes</b> worn by {{centuries of}} wheels, high banks on either side, heavy with {{dripping}} moss and fleshy hart's-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and mottled bramble {{gleamed in the}} light of the sinking sun. Still steadily rising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge, and skirted a noisy stream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray boulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with scrub oak and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of delight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions. To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the country-side, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year. Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation--sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.|$|R
60|$|There was no {{wind that}} day. On the beech-trees were still just enough of coppery leaves {{to look like}} fires lighted high-up to air the eeriness; {{but most of the}} twigs, pearled with water, were {{patterned}} very naked against universal grey. Berries were few, except the pink spindle one, so far the most beautiful, of which there were more than Earth generally vouchsafes. There was no sound in the <b>deep</b> <b>lanes,</b> none of that sweet, overhead sighing of yesterday at the same hour, but there was a quality of silence--a dumb mist murmuration. We passed a tree with a proud pigeon sitting on its top spire, quite too heavy for the twig delicacy below; undisturbed by the mare's hoofs or the creaking of saddle leather, he let us pass, absorbed in his world of tranquil turtledoves. The mist had thickened to a white, infinitesimal rain-dust, and in it the trees began to look strange, as though they had lost one another. The world seemed inhabited only by quick, soundless wraiths as one trotted past.|$|R
60|$|A walk {{was a rare}} {{treat to}} the busy mother, and, {{with a look of}} delight, she consented to leave her mending and her {{children}} to Charlotte. There seldom were two happier beings than that pair, as they wandered slowly, arm-in-arm, in the <b>deep</b> green <b>lanes,</b> in the summer twilight, talking sometimes of the present, sometimes of the future, but with the desultory, vague speculation of those who feared little because they knew how little there was to fear.|$|R
6000|$|Two {{or three}} days later it was rumoured that a strange dog had {{been seen in the}} {{neighbourhood}} of Winterbourne Bishop, in the fields; and women and children going to or coming from outlying cottages and farms had encountered it, sometimes appearing suddenly out of the furze-bushes and staring wildly at them; or they would meet him in some <b>deep</b> <b>lane</b> between hedges, and after standing still a moment eyeing them he would turn and fly in terror from their strange faces. Shepherds began to be alarmed for the safety of their sheep, and there was a good deal of excitement and talk about the strange dog. Two {{or three days}} later Caleb encountered it. He was returning from his flock at the side of a large grass field where four or five women were occupied cutting the thistles, and the dog, which he immediately recognized as the one he had seen at the turnpike, was following one of the women about. She was greatly alarmed, and called to him, [...] "Come here, Caleb, for goodness' sake, and drive this big dog away! He do look so desprit, I'm afeared of he." ...|$|R
