In general, bioinformatics problems are solved by interconnecting several small software pieces to perform complex analyses. This demands certain expertise to create, enact and monitor such tools compositions. In addition bioinformatics is immersed in the big-data territory, facing huge problems to analyse such amount of data. We have addressed these problems by integrating a tools management platform (Galaxy) and a Cloud infrastructure, which prevents moving the big datasets between different locations and allows the dynamic scaling of the computing resources depending on the user needs. The result is a user-friendly platform that facilitates {{the work of the}} end-users while performing their experiments, <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> a <b>Cloud</b> environment that includes authentication, security and big-data transfer mechanisms. To demonstrate the suitability of our approach we have integrated in the infrastructure an existing pairwise and multiple genome comparison tool which comprises the management of huge datasets and high computational demands...|$|R

A new {{architectural}} concept of parallel computing in GRID systems and cloud environment is proposed, which uses FPGA as a high-performance heterogeneous computing resource. FPGA {{is used as}} heterogeneous programmable operating unit for processing data streams, allowing for achievement of optimized performance-related energy consumption. The concept simplifies programming the computational problems for these systems. New approaches to computation scheduling in heterogeneous GRID systems are developed, that allow for optimizing the workload of computing resources, and effectively carry out their monitoring. A new method of resynchronization of synchronous dataflow graphs is proposed, that provides design of pipelined datapaths for FPGAs, which have minimized costs and optimized performance. The CAD tool of parallel computing systems described in VHDL is designed {{which is based on}} this method. The tool is implemented as an application <b>in</b> the <b>cloud</b> environment. The client side of the experimental CAD tool is installed on a Web-browser, and the server side is <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the HP Blade server C 3000, which is placed in NTUU "KPI". The divider, square root, IIR filter core generator is designed, which generates the pipelined IP cores with excellent parameters of speed and hardware volume. The IIR filters are multiplier free, and their structures are found using the filter structure ontology and applied knowledge base. The IP core generators are intended for <b>installing</b> <b>in</b> a <b>cloud</b> environment, or <b>in</b> Web-server. The generated digital filters have minimum hardware costs and maximum sample rate that achieves to 400 MHz. Developed CAD tools helped to design a number of IP cores such as Ethernet controller, Reed- Solomon decoder, pipelined FFT processors, 2 -D DCT processors, microprocessor ARMv. 3 core, i 8051 microcontroller core, which has a performance of 100 mln. instructions per second. ??????????? ????? ????????????? ????????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ????-???????? ? ???????? ????? ? ?????????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ?????????- ??? ????

40|$|Entity Resolution In data {{engineering}} {{refers to}} searching for data records originating {{from the same}} entitles across different data sources. The solutions for Entity Resolution usually employ blocking and learning techniques to distinguish matching records from non-matching records. In this thesis, Density Monotonicity is first introduced to block data. Through clustering candidate data via the density information, most of the non-matches can be correctly detected and blocked. As a result, a more balanced dataset can be acquired. Compared to other blocking approaches that rely heavily on manually designed blocking criteria, the density-driven blocking approach can automatically find a suitable blocking criterion without the supervision of human experts. However, with the big-data era coming, the efficiency of data-intensive algorithms is challenged by large-scale datasets. To overcome the challenge from big data, parallel blocking Is a regular way to enhance blocking efficiency. With {{the fact that the}} density property still preserves in any randomly sampled dataset, the centralized blocking algorithm is upgraded to a distributed blocking algorithm. To improve efficiency, a probabilistic technique Is adopted to balance the speed and the effect of the distributed blocking algorithm. After the blocking process, to further retrieve matches from remaining dataset, active learning techniques are adopted in this thesis. With the density property, a novel approach is provided to initialize the classifier. The density-based approach can initialize a high-quality classifier without the involvement of human experts. Through the experiments on real-world datasets, the efficiency and effectiveness of the density-based approaches Is validated. The density-based matching algorithms can achieve a better blocking and learning performance than other state-of-art approaches. Compared to other measures used to detect duplicates, density Information can be attained more easily and cheaply Throughout this thesis, the discovery of the data property and the proposed techniques have been examined through many experiments on real-world data sets and on a real cloud. The experiments related to big data were run in Hadoop MapReduce and Spark <b>Installed</b> <b>In</b> the <b>cloud.</b> The experiments evidence the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed techniques...|$|R
