50|$|Initially {{starting}} as {{a studio}} project, Crash Worship soon learned {{the power of}} a live audience. During performances, the band's members (or often provocateurs) would manipulate the crowd, involving them more deeply into the show, ultimately eliminating any boundaries between spectator and performer. The musicians would also mobilize their instruments on and off the stage {{into the middle of the}} audience (or outside), lighting <b>explosives</b> and <b>hosing</b> down the crowd with various liquids creating an atmosphere of celebratory abandon and mirth. Strobe lights, nudity, mysterious liquids, sex and smoke filled rooms (at next to zero visibility) were all a part of the average show. The chaos of these events often invited unwanted attention from police who would later forcibly shut down a large percentage of the band's performances.|$|R
5000|$|A ball turret was a Plexiglas sphere {{set into}} the belly of a B-17 or B-24, and {{inhabited}} by two [...]50 caliber machine guns and one man, a short small man. When this gunner tracked with his machine guns a fighter attacking his bomber from below, he revolved with the turret; hunched upside-down in his little sphere, he looked like the fetus in the womb. The fighters which attacked him were armed with cannon firing <b>explosive</b> shells. The <b>hose</b> was a steam hose.|$|R
5000|$|The {{system works}} by firing a single rocket from a {{launcher}} {{mounted on a}} 136 kilogramme trailer which has to be towed {{to the edge of}} the mined area. Attached to the rocket motor 250 mm L9 53 kg is a 228 m long hose packed with 1455 kg of pe6/al <b>explosive.</b> After the <b>hose</b> lands on the ground it detonates and destroys over 90% of mines along its entire length. The 10% that are not destroyed are simply pushed aside to safety. It can be used in tandem to defeat double impulse mines or mines of greater depth. It also contains a 9 kg high explosive substitute at the end with a [...]9 kg booster of pe4.|$|R

50|$|On 25 April, {{the rebels}} started another attack on Army {{positions}} in the Manshiyah District by using an <b>explosive</b> <b>hose.</b> While the rebels failed to take the strategic Al-Arshadiyah Checkpoint, they did capture 12 buildings during the fighting. The next day, heavy artillery shelling and airstrikes reportedly caused heavy casualties among rebel forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimates}} on {{the number}} of participants in the Labour Day celebrations on Taksim Square in 1977 is usually given as 500,000 citizens. Many participants and in particular the Maoist bloc had not even entered the square when shots were heard. Most witnesses stated that they came from the building of the water supply company (Sular İdaresi) and Intercontinental Hotel (now the Marmara Hotel), the tallest building in Istanbul in 1977. Subsequently the security forces intervened with armoured vehicles making much noise with their sirens and <b>explosives.</b> They also <b>hosed</b> the crowd with pressurized water. People tried to escape through Kazancı Yokuşu, the nearest exit from the square, however a track blocked escape route. Most casualties were caused by the panic that police intervention created.|$|R
500|$|Nebe {{decided to}} try experimenting by murdering Soviet mental patients, first with {{explosives}} near Minsk, and then with automobile exhaust at Mogilev. The idea of using gas was partly inspired by an incident in Nebe's past. One night after a party, Nebe had driven home drunk, parked in his garage, and fallen asleep with the engine running, thus nearly dying of carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust fumes. To conduct the experiments, he ordered chemist Albert Widmann, {{a member of the}} criminal-technical institute of the RKPA, to come to Minsk with [...] of <b>explosives</b> and exhaust <b>hoses.</b> The next day Widmann, Nebe, and an explosives expert carried out their first experiment in prepared bunkers in the Minsk area. According to testimony presented at Widmann's postwar trial: ...|$|R
