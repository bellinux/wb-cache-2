40|$|The {{emphasis}} {{of this work}} is to discuss a scheme for modeling the material <b>grading</b> and structures <b>of</b> heterogeneous objects. To model the <b>material</b> <b>grading</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heterogeneous object, a termed 'grading source' is defined. The grading sources are reference features, which specify the type and position <b>of</b> <b>grading,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>material</b> grading function for controlling the material variation within the geometric boundary of the objects. Within the proposed modeling scheme, a concept on representing objects, which are both heterogeneous in material and structure (e. g. composite laminates), will also be elaborated. For downstream layered manufacturing purposes, a contour sub-division algorithm on each layer arising from slicing a heterogeneous object is proposed. Within each slice, the material grading is decomposed into sub-contours according to the different grading variation. A parameter called 'grading step-width' is defined to control the number of sub-contours and resolution <b>of</b> the <b>grading.</b> With such discretization, it is, therefore, possible to build a heterogeneous object on layered manufacturing machines of different fabricating precision specification. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of granular materials {{depends on their}} <b>grading.</b> Crushing <b>of</b> particles under compression or shear modifies the grain size distribution, with a tendency for the percentage of fine material to increase. It follows that the frictional properties of the material and the critical states are modified as <b>a</b> consequence <b>of</b> the changes in grain size distribution and the available range of packing densities. This paper illustrates an extended experimental investigation of the evolution <b>of</b> the <b>grading</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> artificial granular <b>material,</b> consisting of crushed expanded clay pellets under different loading conditions. The changes <b>of</b> <b>grading</b> <b>of</b> the material after isotropic, one-dimensional and constant mean effective stress triaxial compression were described using a single parameter based on {{the ratio of the}} areas under the current and an ultimate cumulative particle size distribution, which were both assumed to be consistent with self similar grading with varying fractal dimension. Relative breakage was related to the total work input for unit of volume. For poorly graded samples, the observed maximum rate of breakage is practically independent of initial uniformity. Further experiments at higher confining stress are required to investigate the mechanics of breakage <b>of</b> better <b>graded</b> sample...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{geometrical}} confinement and viscosity ratio on droplet coalescence in shear flow are experimentally investigated by means <b>of</b> <b>a</b> counter rotating parallel plate device, {{equipped with a}} microscope. The ratio of droplet diameter to gap spacing is varied between 0. 03 and 0. 33 to study both bulk and confined conditions. Three <b>grades</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Newtonian droplet <b>material</b> are combined with a Newtonian matrix, resulting in three different viscosity ratios, namely, 0. 1, 1. 1, and 2. 6. The effects of confinement are qualitatively similar for all three viscosity ratios. For each system, confinement decreases the coalescence angle and renders coalescence possible up to higher capillary numbers and initial offsets. Moreover, for all three viscosity ratios, confinement induces a lower initial offset boundary below which the approaching droplets reverse flow direction without coalescence. However, there are quantitative differences between the systems. With increasing viscosity ratio, the critical capillary number and critical upper and lower offset boundaries decrease. Since the decrease of the upper offset boundary is more predominant, the coalescence efficiency decreases with viscosity ratio. The droplet trajectories of interacting droplets are affected by both the viscosity ratio and geometrical confinement, which clearly has implications on the coalescence behavior...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 121 - 132. Bacterial {{oxidation}} {{is currently}} finding significant application for the oxidative pretreatment of refractory gold-bearing sulphides. Plants processing sulphide concentrates have commonly been operated at solids concentrations of between 18 and 20 per cent (m/v) (Le 180 and 200 kg. m- 3). At higher concentrations, {{a decline in}} the bio-oxidation rate has been observed. Other metallurgical processes, such as chemical leaching and cyanidation, are performed at higher solids concentrations of between 40 and 50 per cent (400 and 500 kg. m- 3), providing an incentive to increase the solids concentration at which bio-oxidation plants are operated. <b>A</b> review <b>of</b> literature indicated the following factors to be potential causes of reduced bio-oxidation rates at high solids concentrations: oxygen and carbon dioxide mass transfer; a low bacteria-to-solids ratio; mechanical damage of the bacte. ria; and the build-up of inhibitory oxidation products. Interaction of these factors in the completely-mixed reactors that are commonly used for biooxidation, has confounded the interpretation of the effects of individual factors. Analysis of literature data revealed a link between the sulphide <b>grade</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular <b>material</b> and the highest solids concentration at which the bacterial oxidation rate was maximal. The oxygen demand is directly proportional to the sulphide concentration in the reactor. Correlations were used to predict the oxygen transfer potential in the experimental reactors and it was found {{that as long as the}} oxygen transfer potential exceeded the oxygen demand, the biooxidation rate was proportional to the solids concentration for <b>a</b> specific <b>material.</b> Wh~n the oxygen demand equalled or exceeded the oxygen transfer potential, then the bacterial oxidation rate was limited by oxygen availability. The sulphide <b>grade</b> is characteristic <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular ore or concentrate and from the data analysis oxygen availabiiity appeared to be the underlying reason why low grade materials could be oxidised at the maximum specific bio-oxidation rate at far higher solids concentrations than high-grade f!laterials. Abstract ii The experiments performed in this study were designed to further investigate the apparent relationship, identified by analysis of literature data, between sulphide grade and the solids concentration at which the bacterial oxidation rate was maximal. The effect of both solids concentration and sulphide grade on the biooxidation rate was investigated and related to the oxygen availability in the reactor...|$|R
40|$|Functionally graded {{materials}} (FGMs) are composites {{that have}} continuously varying material properties, which eliminate undesirable stress concentrations {{that might otherwise}} occur in layered composites. The concept of inhomogeneously varying properties is observed in nature; examples include bones, teeth, shells and timber. Modern engineering applications of FGMs include thermal barrier coatings, wear-resistant coatings, biomedical implants and MEMS devices. Syntactic foams, particle ﬁlled nano-composites are examples of inhomogeneous materials of current interest. Analyses and experiments available in the literature have focused on characterizing the inhomogeneous material modulus and density variations. Common techniques employed are nano-indentation and wave propagation studies. There are a few fracture mechanics analyses and experiments available in the literature; {{most of which are}} devoted to measuring the fracture toughness <b>of</b> <b>graded</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>A</b> few fracture analyses <b>of</b> <b>graded</b> materials are devoted to deriving asymptotic stress, strain and displacement ﬁelds around stationary and steadily growing cracks in inhomogeneous <b>materials.</b> Only <b>a</b> few studies exist that deal with understanding the effect of material property inhomogeneity on the spontaneous crack propagation. In the present thesis the effect of material property inhomogeneity on the dynamic fracture mechanics of cracks in FGMs is described. Numerical analysis of the elastodynamic initial boundary value problem is performed using a spectral scheme. Spectral scheme is a special numerical technique developed to simulate spontaneous, planar crack propagation in <b>a</b> variety <b>of</b> <b>materials.</b> The method is numerically efficient as it can be implemented on parallel machines with ease. The numerical scheme is versatile and can handle any state-and rate-dependent traction-separation laws (cohesive zone models) or frictional laws. Spectral scheme has successfully been used in simulating intersonic crack propagation, earthquake slip dynamics and also direct silicon wafer bonding process used in realizing 3 D MEMS structures. In the present work, the spectral formulation accounts for the inhomogeneous variation in the material wave speeds in the medium. The effect of inhomogeneity on spontaneous crack propagation due to in-plane mixed-mode loading is also addressed here. A parametric study has been performed by varying the inhomogeneity length scales independently in the top and bottom half-spaces. The effect of inhomogeneity in shear wave speed on the dynamic stress intensity factors (SIFs) <b>of</b> <b>a</b> crack propagating in a quasi-steady-state along the interface between the two functionally graded half-spaces is studied. A symmetric hardening FGM offers the maximum fracture resistance, while the fracture resistance is minimum for a symmetric softening FGM. Our simulation shows that increasing the inhomogeneity in the wave speed leads to eliminate the overshoot in the dynamic stress intensity factor. The magnitude of the steady-state (long-time) SIF increases indicating an increase in the fracture resistance. The effect of the inhomogeneous wave speed on the mode- 3 crack propagation characteristics is demonstrated by taking snapshots of the crack opening at a time interval. The magnitude of the crack sliding displacement is found to increase with increase in the inhomogeneity. The effect of the material property inhomogeneity on the mode- 1 crack propagation is simulated to track the crack opening displacements. The inhomogeneity is assumed to be symmetric about the weak-plane. Our spectral scheme developed here for functionally graded material with exponential variation in the material properties is capable of simulating independent bimaterial combinations. When the graded material becomes progressively stiﬀer and denser (hardening), the crack opening displacement in reduced, indicating an increase in the fracture resistance. On the other hand, for the softening FGMs the crack opening displacement increases indicating a reduction in fracture toughness. It is noted that the cohesive fracture resistance on the weak-plane remains same in all the FGMs...|$|R
