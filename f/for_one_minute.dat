5|$|Hero. A {{version of}} the team deathmatch where a hero is {{randomly}} selected on both sides <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute,</b> or until the hero dies. The hero gets a health boost, damage boost, and every weapon in the game (which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute). The key difference between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing the Hero or when the Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total.|$|E
5|$|Late on 7February, {{while still}} {{tracking}} to the east-southeast, Jasmine rapidly intensified, with wind speeds increasing to 185km/h (115mph), sustained <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute.</b> The cyclone developed a ragged eye stretching 40km (25mi) across. Later that day, Jasmine {{reached its peak}} intensity as it passed 280km (175mi) to the north-northeast of New Caledonia, with wind speeds of 215km/h (135mph), equivalent to a Category4 cyclone on both the Australian and Saffir-Simpson hurricane scales (SSHS). Throughout 8February, Jasmine began to show characteristics of an annular hurricane, maintaining a large, asymmetric eye and rather shallow convective features. In addition, multiple eyewall mesovorticies developed within the eye.|$|E
5|$|Halfway {{through the}} day, England fell to 5/119, and captain Yardley came in. He hit Toshack in the air, but Barnes {{was unable to}} {{complete}} the reflex catch at short leg. However, this error did not cost many runs. Yardley lofted Toshack into the on-side and the hands of Johnson at forward square leg to fall for 22 with the score at 6/141. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6. Toshack bowled Dick Pollard late in the innings to finish with 2/75 from 41 overs—including 20 maidens—as England ended with 363. Toshack was unbeaten on zero and was only at the crease <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> as Australia replied with 221. In the second innings, Toshack removed Compton for a duck, caught in the slips by Miller, and ended with 1/26 as the rain-affected match ended in a draw. He also had Washbrook dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson, one of several times that the batsman was reprieved during the innings.|$|E

5|$|However, Jasmine did not {{maintain}} its peak intensity {{for an extended}} period of time. By 9February, the cloud tops surrounding Jasmine began to warm, and thus weakened. In addition, the cyclone began to enter cooler SSTs. Although Jasmine's convective bands continued to thin out, the cyclone maintained a gradually expanding eyewall and remained a compact system. By 10February, the eyewall of Cyclone Jasmine measured 95km (60mi) in diameter. The next day, the subtropical ridge that had been forcing Jasmine toward the southeast had weakened, and as a result the cyclone began to track east-northeast, toward a weakness in the ridge. The storm continued to disorganize, with its eye later becoming cloud–filled. By the end of 11February, Jasmine had already weakened to a cyclone with wind speeds of just 85km/h (50mph), sustained <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute,</b> due to the presence of strong vertical wind shear. The low–level circulation center of Jasmine became partly exposed for a period of time on 12February, before convection redeveloped over the center. As a weakening cyclone, Jasmine only maintained an area of weak convection displaced to its east as it approached Tonga.|$|E

25|$|It is more {{acceptable}} {{for women to}} touch than men in social or friendship settings, possibly because of the inherent dominance of the person touching over the person being touched.

25|$|When a {{blue card}} is issued, it is {{considered}} to be a non-stacking yellow card, and can either result in being sent back to hoops or spend one minute in the penalty box. When a yellow card is issued the player must sit in the penalty box <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute.</b> If the opposing team scores before the minute is up then the player will be allowed to return to the game. He or she is still considered off broom and must tag their teams hoops in order to resume play. If a player receives two yellow cards, then the card will become red. If a player receives a red card, that player must sit in the penalty box for two minutes.|$|E

25|$|When {{scanning}} {{electron microscopy}} is not available, a faster, lower cost technique is potassium permanganate staining. The collected eggs are rinsed with a normal saline solution {{and placed in a}} glass petri dish. The eggs are soaked in a 1% potassium permanganate solution <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> and then dehydrated and mounted onto a slide for observation. These slides can be used with any light microscope with a calibrated eyepiece to compare various morphological features. The most important and useful features for identifying eggs are the size, length, and width of the plastron, as well as the morphology of the plastron in the area around the micropyle. The various measurements and observations when compared to standards for forensically important species are used to determine the species of the egg.|$|E
25|$|By Saturday, March 30, Sheriff Presley and Chief of Police Jack Runnels {{posted a}} $500 reward {{in an effort}} to gain any new {{information}} on the Griffin and Moore case that would lead to the arrest and conviction of the slayer or slayers. Officers stated that all clues found thus far had been fruitless. The results from the blood-stained sand were expected to arrive the day before, but due to delays at the laboratory, the results had not come in. By April 11, the officers were still hard at work on the case. Presley said that his department and other authorities had not relaxed <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> since the discovery of the crime. He also stated that the $500 reward was still being offered and that no tip, no matter how small, was left without a thorough investigation.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{administering}} resveratrol {{in humans}} may be buccal delivery, that is without swallowing, by direct absorption through tissues {{on the inside}} of the mouth. When one milligram of resveratrol in 50 ml 50% alcohol/ water solution was retained in the mouth <b>for</b> <b>one</b> <b>minute</b> before swallowing, 37nbsp&ng/ml of free resveratrol was measured in plasma two minutes later. This level of unchanged resveratrol in blood can only be achieved with 250nbsp&mg of resveratrol taken in a pill form. However, the viability of a buccal delivery method is called into question due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule. For a drug to be absorbed transmucosally it must be in free-form or dissolved. Resveratrol fits the criteria for oral transmucosal dosing, except for this caveat. The low aqueous solubility greatly limits the amount that can be absorbed through the buccal mucosa. Resveratrol that is attempted to be taken buccally was expected to pass through the mucous membrane of the mouth and be absorbed as an oral dose, however, the need to explore buccal delivery in future pharmaceutical formulations was expressed.|$|E
