5|$|The trophy was {{presented}} to Milan captain Paolo Maldini <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Guest</b> of Honour's box, as UEFA President Michel Platini favoured {{a return to the}} past tradition of the winning captain receiving the trophy among the fans. It had become customary in recent years to have the presentation on a hastily constructed podium in the centre of the pitch. This {{was the first time that}} the trophy {{was presented}} to a winning captain by a UEFA president who had actually played against him in the past; during Michel Platini's final seasons with Juventus, the then-teenager Paolo Maldini was making his professional début with Milan.|$|E

50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> {{interviews}} throughout 2016 were concluded by Big Cat asking three questions: if <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> washed their apples, who {{the most}} famous person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest's</b> cell phone was, and a third question tailored to each guest. This third question was often the most provocative or ridiculing one of the interview.|$|R
25|$|The series {{centers on}} three aging {{entertainment}} industry veterans from Los Angeles, Melanie (Valerie Bertinelli), Joy (Jane Leeves), and Victoria (Wendie Malick).

25|$|Police {{took the}} only {{survivor}} at the address, the property's caretaker William Garretson, in for questioning. Garretson lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> {{house that was}} located on the property, but {{a short distance from}} the house, and not immediately visible. As the first suspect, Garretson was questioned and submitted to a polygraph test. Garretson stated that Parent had visited him at approximately 11:30p.m. and left shortly thereafter. Garretson informed police that he had no involvement in the murders and did not know anything that could help the investigation. Police accepted his explanation and he was released.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{so-called}} VRDP protocol used in the VirtualBox virtual machine implementation by Oracle. This protocol is compatible with all RDP clients, such as that provided with Windows but, unlike the original RDP protocol, can be configured to accept unencrypted and password unprotected connections, which {{may be useful in}} secure and trusted networks, such as home or office LANs. By default, Microsoft's RDP server refuses connections to user accounts with empty passwords (but this can be changed with the Group Policy Editor). External and guest authorization options are provided by VRDP as well. It does not matter which operating system is installed as a guest because VRDP is implemented on the virtual machine (host) level, not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> system. The proprietary VirtualBox Extension Pack is required.|$|E

25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering into his eyes and holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E

He offers {{to take them}} into town to get fitted into rubber boots, but they end up spending the money he gave them on drinks. Monty is hurt, though he puts {{it out of his}} mind quickly during a boozy round of poker. Marwood is terrified of what else Monty might try on him and wants to leave immediately. After much argument, Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood keeps trying to evade Monty but he eventually corners him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> bedroom. Monty reveals that Withnail, when arranging to borrow the cottage, had told Monty that Marwood was a closeted homosexual and that he himself had rejected Marwood's advances. Marwood claims that Withnail is the closeted one and {{that the two of them}} have been in a committed relationship for years. He claims that Withnail is only rejecting him because Monty is around, and that this is the first night that they haven't slept together in years. Monty, a romantic, accepts this explanation and apologises for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail and insists that he will pay.|$|E

500|$|The formal {{engagement}} of marriage was announced on 3 January 1878, a day Rosebery forever afterwards regarded as sacred. Writing {{to a friend}} in January 1878, Rosebery described his wife as [...] "very simple, very unspoilt, very clever, very warm-hearted and very shy... I never knew such a beautiful character." [...] The marriage was celebrated in London on 20 March 1878 at the Board Room of Guardians in Mount Street, and also in a Christian ceremony at Christ Church in Down Street, Piccadilly. To show [...] "official" [...] disapproval, no male member of the Rothschild family attended the ceremonies. However, any shortcomings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> list were compensated for by the guest of honour—the Prince of Wales—and Disraeli, who gave the bride away.|$|E

They were taken to the Del Monte Plantation, where they were lodged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> houses, and had breakfast in the clubhouse. MacArthur sent a couple of sharp messages to Brett in Melbourne and Marshall in Washington. On their second day there, a Filipino woman arrived who wanted to speak to MacArthur. Her son was fighting on Luzon, and she had walked [...] {{in the hope that the}} general would have some news about him.

After returning from a hunting trip with Tim Riggins, he finds out {{that his father was}} killed in Iraq. The episode [...] "The Son" [...] shows Matt going through the five stages of grief as he comes to accept the death of his father, a man he claims to hate. This episode garnered much buzz online and resulted in a failed campaign for Zach Gilford to get an Emmy nomination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> actor category; however, the episode did get an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series. After this emotionally charged episode, Matt abruptly moves to Chicago without saying goodbye to his girlfriend or best friend. He returns briefly in the finale and makes amends with both Julie and Landry, who ends up flying back to Chicago with Matt.|$|E

500|$|... "The Final Hours", {{the third}} episode of Son of God, details Jesus's last days alive. Bowen {{claims that the}} Last Supper would have been held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>guest</b> room of a [...] "well-to-do" [...] house in Jerusalem. Writings by Josephus suggest that the Last Supper {{took place in a}} triclinium. As guest of honour, Jesus would have been {{at the end of the}} table with John the Apostle at his side, rather than at the centre, as {{proposed}} by more familiar depictions such as Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Bowen then looks at whether or not Jesus could have sweated blood at Gethsemane. Leaving the Middle East for the first time, he travels to New York City and meets with Frederick Zugibe, a forensic pathologist at Columbia University. Zugibe states that Jesus may have been suffering from hematidrosis, a medical condition brought about by stress from knowing that one is about to die. He also says that he has seen similar symptoms in sailors and in men given death sentences. Zugibe experiments on volunteers in Rutland County, Vermont, by measuring their blood pressure while they are strapped to crosses with their arms outstretched and level with their shoulders. He concludes that the traditional view of Jesus's crucifixion, with the nails of the cross driven through his hands rather than wrists, may have been possible if his feet were supported. The 1968 discovery of the skeleton of Jehohanan, a first-century man who was put to death by crucifixion, also supports this theory. Next, Bowen questions whether the disciple Judas Iscariot truly did double-cross Jesus. William Klassen, an historian at École Biblique in Jerusalem, theorises that the Greek word [...] "paradidomi" [...] was mistranslated, and that Judas simply [...] "handed over" [...] Jesus to the Romans, rather than betrayed him.|$|E
