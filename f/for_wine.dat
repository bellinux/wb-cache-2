5|$|Writing {{about the}} failure of the project, The New York Times and other {{newspapers}} suggested that Copia had failed to clearly define its focus. Potential tourists were left feeling unsure whether they were visiting a museum, a cooking school, or a promotional center <b>for</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cork is {{produced}} from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It is harvested {{from the living}} trees about once every ten years in an environmentally sustainable industry. More than half the world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> bottles. Other uses include floor tiles, bulletin boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.|$|E
5|$|Excavations on Glastonbury Tor, {{undertaken}} {{by a team}} led by Philip Rahtz between 1964 and 1966, revealed evidence of Dark Age occupation during the 5th to 7th centuries around the later medieval church of St. Michael. Finds included postholes, two hearths including a metalworker's forge, two burials oriented north-south (thus unlikely to be Christian), fragments of 6th century Mediterranean amphorae (vases <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> or cooking oil), and a worn hollow bronze head which may have topped a Saxon staff.|$|E

5|$|Facilities <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> {{tourists}} in Oregon are considered underdeveloped compared to wine regions in California, especially premium growing regions like the Napa Valley AVA. Only 5% of overnight leisure trips {{in the state}} involve visits to wineries, a much smaller figure than comparable Californian growing regions, which range from 10% to 25%.|$|E
5|$|In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning (chapter 38), the enthroned {{figure of}} High {{explains}} that Odin gives {{all of the}} food on his table to his wolves Geri and Freki and that Odin requires no food, <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> is to him both meat and drink. High then quotes the above-mentioned stanza from the poem Grímnismál in support. In chapter 75 of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál {{a list of names}} for wargs and wolves is provided that includes both Geri and Freki.|$|E
5|$|Irrigation made it {{possible}} to grow grapes <b>for</b> <b>wine.</b> The first grapes were planted at Hanwood in the spring of 1913 by John James McWilliam and his eldest son Jack who had come to the district from their winery in Junee. Irrigation was by carting of water until the irrigation channels were opened a few months later. The first grapes were picked in 1916 and sent to Junee for processing. Penfolds established their winery in the region in 1919.|$|E
50|$|While {{there are}} no DOC {{restrictions}} on the exact proportions of the blend, the grape varieties used in Trento DOC are limited to Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot blanc. After secondary fermentation, the wines must rest on their lees {{for a minimum of}} 15 months <b>for</b> non-vintage <b>wines,</b> 24 months <b>for</b> vintage <b>wines</b> and 36 months <b>for</b> <b>wines</b> labeled as Riserva. The alcohol level <b>for</b> the finished <b>wines</b> must be a minimum of 11.5% for non-vintage and vintage <b>wines</b> and 12% <b>for</b> Riserva <b>wines.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Champagne {{province}} {{is located}} near the northern limits of the wine world along the 49th parallel. The high altitude and mean annual temperature of 10°C (50°F) creates a difficult environment <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> grapes to fully ripen. Ripening is aided {{by the presence of}} forests which helps to stabilize temperatures and maintain moisture in the soil. The cool temperatures serve to produce high levels of acidity in the resulting grape which is ideal for sparkling wine.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{name for}} the museum was simply the American Center <b>for</b> <b>Wine,</b> Food and the Arts, though before opening it was additionally named after Copia, the Roman goddess of wealth and plenty. According to Joseph Spence in Polymetis (1755), Copia is a name {{used to describe the}} goddess Abundantia in poetry, and was referred to as Bona Copia in Ovid's Metamorphoses.|$|E
5|$|Dennie had health trouble {{throughout}} his life, {{as well as}} a predilection <b>for</b> <b>wine.</b> His father (who had battled mental illness) died on September 28, 1811; Dennie was not able to attend his father's funeral, as he himself was gravely ill at the time, and this caused him great grief. He briefly recovered, but succumbed to cholera morbus four months after his father's death. Dennie died on January 7, 1812, and was interred two days later at St. Peter's Church, Philadelphia. His epitaph was written by John Quincy Adams. The epitaph erroneously gives Lexington, Massachusetts as his birthplace; in fact, Dennie was born in Boston, but his family moved to Lexington shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|In August 1492, Christopher Columbus {{stopped at}} La Gomera in the Canary Islands, <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> and water, {{intending}} to stay only four days. He became romantically {{involved with the}} governor of the island, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, and stayed a month. When he finally sailed, she gave him cuttings of sugarcane, which became the first to reach the New World. The first sugar cane harvest was conducted in Hispaniola in 1501, and many sugar mills had been constructed in Cuba and Jamaica by the 1520s. The Portuguese took sugar cane to Brazil. By 1540, there were 800 cane sugar mills in Santa Catarina Island and another 2,000 on the north coast of Brazil, Demarara, and Surinam.|$|E
5|$|The CIA has {{a branch}} campus in Napa County, California. The primary campus in St. Helena {{is known as}} the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone; the {{satellite}} campus in the city of Napa {{is known as the}} Culinary Institute of America at Copia. The campus runs associate degree programs as well as certificate programs, continuing education courses, custom classes, conferences, and seminars including the Worlds of Flavor International Conference & Festival each year. The Rudd Center for Professional Wine Studies runs wine instruction classes and a certification program <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> professionals.|$|E
5|$|The college's New York campus {{also offers}} {{continuing}} education courses and certificate programs. The California and Texas campuses run several continuing education classes, and the California campus also has programs <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> professionals. A variety {{of programs for}} food enthusiasts are run as well at all the U.S. campuses. The college partnered with Epicurious in running an online cooking school featuring a variety of culinary classes. The CIA also runs a certification program called ProChef, a program to recognize culinary and academic skills, as well as familiarity with business practices.|$|E

50|$|The Bocksbeutel {{is a type}} of {{wine bottle}} with the form of a {{flattened}} ellipsoid.

5|$|The winery {{had been}} founded by both {{his father and}} his {{grandfather}}, Hermann Schnaufer, in 1919, shortly after World War I. Following the death of his grandfather in 1928 the winery was run by his father alone. When his father unexpectedly died in 1940, his mother ran the business until the children took over the winery after World War II. The company then expanded the business and in addition to the winery offered wine imports, sparkling wines, and a distillery <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> and liqueur. The distribution channel worked with agents and sales offices throughout Germany.|$|E
5|$|Land {{transport}} {{utilized the}} advanced system of Roman roads. The in-kind taxes paid by communities included {{the provision of}} personnel, animals, or vehicles for the cursus publicus, the state mail and transport service established by Augustus. Relay stations were located along the roads every seven to twelve Roman miles, and tended to grow into a village or trading post. A mansio (plural mansiones) was a privately run service station franchised by the imperial bureaucracy for the cursus publicus. The support staff at such a facility included muleteers, secretaries, blacksmiths, cartwrights, a veterinarian, and a few military police and couriers. The distance between mansiones was determined by how far a wagon could travel in a day. Mules were the animal most often used for pulling carts, travelling about 4mph. As {{an example of the}} pace of communication, it took a messenger a minimum of nine days to travel to Rome from Mainz in the province of Germania Superior, even on a matter of urgency. In addition to the mansiones, some taverns offered accommodations as well as food and drink; one recorded tab for a stay showed charges <b>for</b> <b>wine,</b> bread, mule feed, and the services of a prostitute.|$|E
25|$|Another {{indication}} {{of the importance of}} wine in ancient Israel is that Hebrew contains numerous terms for various stages and types of vines, grape varieties and words <b>for</b> <b>wine.</b> The word yayin was used both as a generic word <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> and as a term <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> in its first year, once it had undergone sufficient fermentation from the initial stage, when it was called tirosh. The type of wine was determined by the grapes, the time allowed for fermentation, and the age of the wine.|$|E
25|$|The maximum {{allowable}} doses {{depend on the}} sugar content of the wine: the residual sugar is susceptible to attack by microorganisms which would cause a restart of fermentation. In France the dose is limited to 150mg/litre for Vin de Pays (country <b>wines),</b> 185mg/l <b>for</b> Sparkling <b>wines,</b> 200mg/l <b>for</b> Fortified <b>wines,</b> 200mg/l <b>for</b> dry white <b>wines,</b> 250mg/l <b>for</b> white <b>wines</b> with residual sugar greater than 5g/litre (Moelleux <b>wines),</b> and 300mg/l <b>for</b> liquoreux sweet <b>wines.</b>|$|R
