5000|$|The chukar {{partridge}} {{is part of}} {{a confusing}} group of [...] "red-legged partridges". Several plumage variations within the widespread distribution of the chukar partridge have been described and designated as subspecies. In the past the chukar group was included with the rock partridge (also known as the <b>Greek</b> <b>partridge).</b> The species from Turkey and farther east was subsequently separated from A. graeca of Greece and Bulgaria and western Europe.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of D-Loop, {{the source of}} mtDNA replication, in populations from different species of partridges, has proved the existence of differential haplotypes for the Red, <b>Greek</b> and Chuckar <b>partridges.</b> Based on this, {{we have used a}} technique using the mitochondrial D-Loop amplification and sequencing which allows the detection of specific mutations, so that inter-specific crossings in the maternal line can be traced. A total of 1410 partridges divided into 282 groups of 5 individuals have been analysed. Results show that in 87 of these groups, there is genetic introgression of partridge species different from the red in at least one individual...|$|R
