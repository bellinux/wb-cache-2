5000|$|Male Jalmenus evagoras exhibit protandry, usually {{emerging}} before {{females of}} the same species. In {{an effort to find}} mates, they regularly patrol trees containing pupae, taking into account the fact that <b>healthy</b> <b>larvae</b> and pupae are found in areas with attending ants. [...] Only the healthy juvenile butterflies they are seeking live amongst the ants, and learning this cue serves as a way for male butterflies to find suitable females before they even mature, saving them both time and energy. Males are not territorial and will readily leave one host plant to join another mating ball. Males are sexually indiscriminate in mate searching, often resulting in attempted copulations with eclosing males. Female pupae are generally a bit larger than male pupae so size could in fact be used as an indicator of sex to avoid mistaken copulations. However, male Jalmenus evagoras do not depend on size and {{there is no evidence that}} they land on the bigger pupae, just the pupae that are tended to by more attendant ants. This shows the importance of the presence or absence of ants as a major factor in mate selection. In addition, males mate multiple times, and if they are successful, have been observed to mate as many as seven times in their lifetime. The three components of male lifetime mating success is longevity, encounter rate, and mating efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Baculoviruses {{manipulate}} insect larval behaviour by inducing increased {{activity and}} by enhancing {{the movement to}} the top of the host plant. The Spodoptera littoralis nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpliNPV) may have a large impact on larval populations and is currently used as a control method. Dispersal of NPVs is fairly limited since foliage or infected larvae need to be ingested for transmission. S. littoralis is cannibalistic under high population densities or low food availability conditions. We hypothesized that <b>healthy</b> <b>larvae</b> recognize and are attracted to virus-infected cadavers. Dual choice experiments in petri dish arenas, involving infected and uninfected larval cadaver suspensions revealed no significant differences in neonate larval attraction. In contrast, fourth instar larvae fed significantly more on infected larval cadavers than on cadavers of uninfected larvae. Although mortality of larvae that fed on infected cadavers was increased, high mortality in both groups suggests vertical transmission of the virus in this species. Our results show that that virus-killed cadavers increase attraction and feeding by <b>healthy</b> <b>larvae.</b> Consumption of conspecific cadavers increases viral dissemination. Our results suggest that larvae killed by NPV infection emit chemical cues, which make them more attractive to conspecific larvae, thereby promoting in viral transmission...|$|E

In choice tests, parasitoids examined and stung significantly more virus infected than <b>healthy</b> <b>larvae,</b> apparently {{due to a lack}} of defense reaction in virus infected hosts. Parasitoid-mediated virus transmission was observed in 100 % of the female parasitoids that stung a virus infected host in the laboratory. Each female parasitoid transmitted the virus to an average (SE) of 3 : 7 0 : 3 larvae immediately after stinging an infected larva. Caged field experiments supported this result; virus transmission to <b>healthy</b> <b>larvae</b> only occurred in cages containing infected hosts (as inoc-ulum) and parasitoids (as vectors). The virus was highly detrimental to parasitoid development because of premature host death and lethal infection of the developing endoparasitoid. Female parasitoids that emerged from virus infected hosts did not transmit the virus to healthy hosts.

40|$|Shortly {{prior to}} death, {{many species of}} Lepidoptera {{infected}} with nucleopolyhedrovirus climb upwards on the host plant. This results in improved dissemination of viral occlusion bodies over plant foliage and an increased probability of transmission to healthy conspecific larvae. Following applications of Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus for control of Spodoptera exigua on greenhouse-grown sweet pepper crops, necrophagy was observed by healthy S. exigua larvae that fed on virus-killed conspecifics. We examined whether this risky behavior was induced by olfactory or phagostimulant compounds associated with infected cadavers. Laboratory choice tests and olfactometer studies, involving infected and non-infected cadavers placed on spinach leaf discs, revealed no evidence for greater attraction of <b>healthy</b> <b>larvae</b> to virus-killed over non-infected cadavers. Physical contact or feeding on infected cadavers resulted in a very high incidence of transmission (82 - 93 % lethal disease). Observations {{on the behavior of}} S. exigua larvae on pepper plants revealed that infected insects died on the uppermost 10 % of foliage and closer to the plant stem than healthy conspecifics of the same stage, which we considered clear evidence of baculovirus-induced climbing behavior. <b>Healthy</b> <b>larvae</b> that subsequently foraged on the plant were more frequently observed closer to the infected than the non-infected cadaver. <b>Healthy</b> <b>larvae</b> also encountered and fed on infected cadavers significantly more frequently and more rapidly than larvae that fed on non-infected cadavers. Intraspecific necrophagy on infected cadavers invariably resulted in virus transmission and death of the necrophagous insect. We conclude that, in addition to improving the dissemination of virus particles over plant foliage, baculovirus-induced climbing behavior increases the incidence of intraspecific necrophagy in S. exigua, which is the most efficient mechanism of transmission of this lethal pathogen.

Incorporation of a juvenile hormone analogue in the artificial diet increased OB production seven times. The pathogenicity and infectivity of the isolates was compared using neonate P. xylostella. A single Kenyan isolate (PlxyGV- 2. 18) was shown to have a significantly shorter median lethal time to death (LT 50) than the other nine isolates in other geographical populations of P. xylostella. No synergism was observed between the isolates in mixed inoculations of P. xylostella and a slower killing isolate predominated over a faster killing isolate in mixed inoculations.

A total of 186 isolates from the dominant bacterial flora was characterized by Biolog metabolic fingerprinting and identified by comparison to a database of 850 Vibrio type- and reference strains. Representative Vibrio harveyi strains were further genotypically analyzed by AFLP fingerprinting of whole-genomes. An overwhelming predominance of V. alginolyticus and V. harveyi was observed in the larval developmental stages from zoae stage on. The flora associated with larvae is not very stable and is influenced by the bacterial flora of the administered food and by the environment. In the 1995 survey, the bacterial flora of successful P. chinensis larvae productions was mainly dominated by V. alginolyticus and unidentified Gram negative strains, while V. harveyi was absent. The bacterial numbers gradually increased from nauplii stage to post-larval stage, but few vibrios were isolated from nauplii stage. High V. harveyi numbers (up to 10 5 CFU/larva) in the larvae are correlated with weak larvae and mass mortalities.

40|$|During {{the last}} 40 years, Drosophila melanogaster {{has become an}} {{invaluable}} tool in understanding innate immunity. The innate immune system of Drosophila consists of a humoral and a cellular component. While many details are known about the humoral immune system, our knowledge about the cellular immune system is comparatively small. Blood cells or hemocytes constitute the cellular immune system. Three blood types have been described for Drosophila larvae. Plasmatocytes are phagocytes with a plethora of functions. Crystal cells mediate melanization and contribute to wound healing. Plasmatocytes and crystal cells constitute the blood cell repertoire of a <b>healthy</b> <b>larva,</b> whereas lamellocytes are induced in a demand-adapted manner after infection with parasitoid wasp eggs. They {{are involved in the}} melanotic encapsulation response against parasites and form melanotic nodules that are also referred to as tumors. In my thesis, I focused on unraveling the mechanisms of how the immune system orchestrates the cellular immune response. In particular, I was interested in the hematopoiesis of lamellocytes. In Article I, we were able to show that ectopic expression of key components of a number of signaling pathways in blood cells induced the development of lamellocytes, led to a proliferative response of plasmatocytes, or to a combination of lamellocyte activation and plasmatocyte proliferation. In Article II, I combined newly developed fluorescent enhancer-reporter constructs specific for plasmatocytes and lamellocytes and developed a “dual reporter system” that was used in live microscopy of fly larvae. In addition, we established flow cytometry as a tool to count total blood cell numbers and to distinguish between different blood cell types. The “dual reporter system” enabled us to differentiate between six blood cell types and established proliferation as a central feature of the cellular immune response. The combination flow cytometry and live imaging increased our understanding of the tempo-spatial events leading to the cellular immune reaction. In Article III, I developed a genetic modifier screen to find genes involved in the hematopoiesis of lamellocytes. I took advantage of the gain-of-function phenotype of the Tl 10 b mutation characterized by an activated cellular immune system, which induced the formation blood cell tumors. We screened the right arm of chromosome 3 for enhancers and suppressors of this mutation and uncovered ird 1.

Bacterial diversity in the intestinal contents decreased after post infection with BmCPV, whereas the abundance of both Enterococcus and Staphylococcus which belongs to Gram-positive were increased. Therefore, our findings suggested that observed changes in relative abundance was related to the immune response of silkworm to BmCPV infection.

When a Claviger is newly introduced in a L. flavus colony (in this case the beetle is referred to as an alien) it is the target of a high number of gaster flexions, similar to the quantity seen for non-myrmecophilous intruder insects (fruit flies and free-living soil beetles) newly introduced in a nest. When a Claviger has been present for some time in a L. flavus colony (in this case being referred to as a resident), it is the target of a lower number of gaster flexions, similar to the number received by newly decaying corpses. A resident Claviger receives more regurgitations than an alien one. When introduced in a colony, a Claviger, alien or resident, is bitten and transported as much as some live, non-myrmecophilous, intruder insects. However, the latter are rarely, if at all, licked and never receive regurgitations. The study also shows that, in laboratory conditions, a regurgitation-releasing substance appears in insect corpses one hour after death and that the maximum quantity of this substance is produced in cadavers 5 to 7 hours after death. As the Claviger is treated in a similar manner as a few hours old corpse, it benefits from the workers' licking sessions and regurgitations. This behavior, along with dismembering bites, is, in fact, intended for the preparation of the solid food given to the brood. Morphological adaptations allow the beetle to resist the workers' dismembering attempts. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Rifampicin-resistant marker was {{employed}} as a reporter to detect the adherence and colonization of V. harveyi in shrimp larvae. Vibrio harveyi P 1 B and YA 32. 2 were isolated from dead shrimp larvae in Besuki, Northern Coast of East Java, while V. harveyi HB 3, was isolated from pristine sea water in Pacitan, Southern Coast of East Java. Vibrio metschnikovii used as biocontrol agent was isolated from <b>healthy</b> shrimp <b>larvae</b> in Serang, West Java. Spontaneous mutation was conducted to generate V. harveyi P 1 B, YA 32. 2 and HB 3 resistant to rifampicin. These mutants exhibited similar survival ability to their parental (wild type) strains. Significant larval mortality was observed in shrimp larvae inoculated with YA 32. 2 than that of larvae inoculated with P 1 B. Larvae inoculated with HB 3 showed the lowest mortality. Bacterial cell count of Vibrio Rf* in dead larvae were 103 - 104 cells/larvae. Isolates of Vibrio metschnikovii Z and M as biocontrol candidates effectively reduced the growth and adherence ability of YA 32. 2 to shrimp larvae. Larval mortality in rearing water inoculated simultaneously with YA 32. 2 and V. metschnikovii was lower than the one inoculated with YA 32. 2 alone. Therefore, Vibrio metschnikovii Z or M could be developed as an effective probiotic or biocontrol agent for V. harveyi in shrimp hatcheries...|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic {{management}} of aquacultured animals, such as Greenshell™ mussel (GSM) larvae, Perna canaliculus, is undesirable because of health concerns and political pressures; hence, alternatives are needed. Herein, two novel probiotic bacteria {{were identified and}} trialled in a GSM larval rearing hatchery. Sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analysis identified the strains as Alteromonas macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536. Both probiotics were evaluated separately at the Glenhaven Aquaculture Centre hatchery facility during routine larval rearing and when the larvae were challenged with both a high (10 ⁷ and 10 ⁶ CFU ml⁻¹) and low (10 ⁶ and 10 ⁵ CFU ml⁻¹) pathogenic dose of Vibrio sp. DO 1 and V. splendidus respectively. In all experiments, probiotic application improved larval survival significantly when administered prior to pathogen exposure. Across all experiments, larvae that {{were exposed to the}} high and low dosages of pathogens averaged 14 % and 36 % survival respectively on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. The administration of probiotics prior to pathogen challenge resulted in larval survival of 50 % and 66 % respectively. Non-inoculated control larvae and larvae administered the probiotic alone demonstrated 67 % and 79 % survival respectively. Neptunomonas sp. 0536 appeared to suppress naturally occurring vibrios in the culture environment of <b>healthy</b> GSM <b>larvae.</b> This is the first report of A. macleodii and Neptunomonas sp. as probiotic bacteria in a large scale production facility. 7 page(s...|$|R
