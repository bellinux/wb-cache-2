5|$|Yannick LeJacq of Kotaku, {{commenting on}} the 2014 game MouseCraft which {{incorporates}} elements of Lemmings and Tetris, speculated that games like Lemmings would not be very successful in the current gaming market, as {{the pace of the}} game <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> slow to satisfy most players.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests have}} shown that the human eyeball <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} after her sinking, many impractical, {{expensive}} and often physically impossible schemes have been put forward to raise Titanic from her resting place. They have included ideas such as filling the wreck with ping-pong balls, injecting it with 180,000 tons of Vaseline, or using half a million tons of liquid nitrogen to encase it inside a giant iceberg that would float back to the surface. However, the wreck <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> fragile to be raised and is now protected by a UNESCO convention.|$|E

5|$|Homer {{does well}} in his first fights, mainly because he is {{competing}} against opponents almost as out of shape as he is. At every match, he follows Moe's advice and gains widespread attention, eventually becoming the top ranked fighter in the Springfield Hobo Boxing Association. Moe's former boxing manager Lucius Sweet visits Moe and announces that the current Heavyweight Champion Drederick Tatum is being released from prison and is ready for a comeback fight, and Sweet wants Tatum to fight Homer. Lucius hopes that due to Homer's fame as a human punching bag, he will at least be able to endure a few rounds. Moe, despite knowing that Tatum <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> strong for a fighter of Homer's ability, promises Sweet that Homer will last three rounds with Tatum.|$|E
5|$|In his book, German Architecture in China, Warner Torsten {{writes of}} the cathedral: According to residents] the cathedral <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> large for {{the scale of}} Qingdao. Its {{position}} {{on top of a}} hill makes this even more evident. Perhaps the idea was to produce a powerful building to hold its own with the Protestant Church, which for 20 years had been the largest religious building in Qingdao, or perhaps the intention was to outstrip the 46metre-high towers of the Franciscan church in Jinan. The towers of the cathedral in Qingdao were higher than all the other churches in the major cities of Northern China– Tianjin, Beijing, Dalian, or Jinan. They dominate the silhouette of Qingdao; they are particularly impressive from a ship entering the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Rita breaks her hip {{while she}} and Brian are having sex. Peter warns Brian that their {{relationship}} will not last much longer {{now that he}} must run errands for her. Brian goes out to pick up medicine for bedridden Rita, but is distracted {{by the sight of}} a group of young women entering a bar. One of them offers to have sex with Brian in the bathroom, after which he returns with her medicine. Realizing that he still loves Rita, he admits his infidelity. However, Rita decides he <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> young for her and breaks off their engagement. A regretful Brian understands that it is for the best and leaves her.|$|E

5|$|With Central Europe {{now under}} the Empire's dominance, Barbarossa turns his {{attention}} to Italy, namely Milan and the Pope. The rise of the Holy Roman Empire has challenged {{the power of the}} Pope in Europe, hence why Barbarossa must be able to subjugate the Italian realms who plot against him. Once again, Henry the Lion betrays Barbarossa, only this time he is stripped of his titles and forced into exile whilst Barbarossa is able to ascertain his superiority in Italy. The Third Crusade begins in the Middle East, and Barbarossa pledges his Empire's support to the coming campaign. But the Holy Roman Empire's army <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> strong for any Navy to carry, forcing Barbarossa to march his troops through hostile Constantinople and Anatolia, which is crawling with Seljuk Turks. During this march, Barbarossa drowns by the weight of his armour in a river current, leaving his army to continue to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem with their dead Emperor to fulfil his wishes.|$|E
5|$|Galileo is lesser known for, {{yet still}} {{credited}} with, {{being one of}} the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E
25|$|Although modern archaeologists {{realize that}} this {{tripartite}} division of prehistoric society <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> simple to reflect the complexity of change and continuity, terms like ‘Bronze Age’ are still used as a very general way of focusing attention on particular times and places and thus facilitating archaeological discussion.|$|E

Pete lived in Liz's apartment for an extended period while separated from his wife.|$|E
25|$|For example, in 1768, {{when asked}} by the {{authorities}} in Copenhagen whether there still lived old nobility in the districts Senja and Troms in Northern Norway, a Danish-rooted official wrote: ‘Of old nobility I know nothing here in the north, but here <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> much farmer nobility or Benkestok nobility!’ As an immigrant to the region, he was unfamiliar with the strong feeling of pride among the so-called page nobility (see below) and the farmers of aristocratic origin.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, a North Carolina {{woman said}} that DNA testing by the Toronto-based company Accu-Metrics showed that she, her mother, {{and her brother}} have Beothuk DNA. Geneticists have {{challenged}} the company's claim as bogus, both because the database it claimed to have is non-existent, and because previous analyses of the only reference Beothuk DNA available, from Nonosabasut and his wife Demasduit, show that it <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> fragmentary to make such an identification. The company suspended its claims after being challenged by geneticists and news media.|$|E

25|$|The {{discovery}} of additional partial skeletons has verified {{the existence of}} some features found in LB1, such as {{the lack of a}} chin, but Jacob and other research teams argue that these features do not distinguish LB1 from local H.sapiens morphology. Lyras et al. have asserted, based on 3D-morphometrics, that the skull of LB1 differs significantly from all H.sapiens skulls, including those of small-bodied individuals and microcephalics, and is similar to the skull of Homo erectus alone. Ian Tattersall argues that the species is wrongly classified as Homo floresiensis as it <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> archaic to be assigned to the genus Homo.|$|E
25|$|After ridding {{himself of}} the Cartel's {{influence}} in the area, Gus fires Walt and warns him that if Hank gets any closer, he will have Walt's family killed. Walt tries {{to use one of}} Saul's connections to get him and his family relocated, but finds most of his drug money has been used by Skyler to pay off Ted's IRS fines to avoid having their own lives investigated. After arranging for his family's safety under the DEA, Walt resolves to kill Gus, but finds that the kingpin <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> protected. Walt begs for Jesse's help, but Jesse refuses.|$|E
25|$|Doubling and twisting. The silk <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>too</b> fine to be woven, {{so now it}} is doubled {{and twisted}} to make the warp, known as {{organzine}} and the weft, known as tram. In organzine each single is given a few twists per inch (tpi), and combine with several other singles counter twisted hard at 10 to 14 tpi. In tram the two singles are doubled with {{each other with a}} light twist, 3 to 6 tpi. Sewing thread is two tram threads, hard twisted, and machine-twist is made of three hard-twisted tram threads. Tram for the crepe process is twisted at up to 80 tpi to make it 'kick up'.|$|E
