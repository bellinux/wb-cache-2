25|$|I still {{care about}} {{everything}} I care about. But I don't {{know how to}} write another song about a greedy arsehole ruining the planet. I have done it. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> about the damage {{of war and the}} environment, but as you drill down deeper, move closer to the core of the heart, there are so many great stories to be had which aren't literally talking about a problem.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, I {{worked in}} a Jewish school in Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there gave me a trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and {{worked in a}} kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> other travel articles.|$|E
500|$|... 'Don't Forget About Us' was a {{song that}} Jermaine [...] and <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> and didn't finish, and L.A. Reid heard it. He was excited about it and he was like, 'We should re-release the album. I agreed because {{were trying to figure}} out what to do with the song because we loved it so much, and we didn't want to wait until the next album to send it to radio.|$|E

5000|$|.....when <b>I</b> first <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> any {{songs that}} were any good I had already become very much {{involved}} with activism and wanting {{to talk about what}} was happening in the world. But when <b>I</b> first <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> songs, <b>I</b> wasn’t writing political songs..." ...|$|R

500|$|Screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi {{acknowledged}} that Ugo Guerra and Elio Scardamaglia, {{the producers of}} Mario Bava's The Whip and the Body (1963), had [...] "shown me an Italian print of The Pit and the Pendulum before <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> it: [...] 'Give us something like this', they said." [...] When asked if another of his films, The Long Hair of Death (1964), was inspired by Corman's film, Gastaldi replied, [...] "Yes, of course! The Pit and the Pendulum had a big influence on Italian horror films. [...] Everybody borrowed from it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{started playing}} and {{learned a few}} songs by other writers to begin with. [...] <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> originals within a few months. [...] My songs were pretty horrendous to begin with. [...] They kept getting better and better. [...] When I graduated, I started playing at open mics in bars in Boston. [...] Eventually {{discovered}} that there were folk clubs where people were actually listening, and not drinking and carousing while you played. [...] I got involved in that circuit. [...] I think that's why I've become so lyric conscious — because of those listening rooms, where {{you really have to}} rely on words in those situations." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> what I {{felt was}} Bat Out of Hell part 2, {{definitely}} like The Godfather part I and part 2, that's how I saw it. I {{wanted to do}} a continuation and I {{wanted to do a}}n album that went even further and that was more extreme, if possible, which a lot of people felt wasn't possible but I just wanted to see if I could make a record that was even more heroic because that's what I thought of it ... Bat Out of Hell to me was ultimately very heroic though it was funny ... and I wanted to do one that to me would be even more heroic and more epic and a little more operatic and passionate.|$|E
50|$|Normally {{we start}} with a riff from Joe, and then we add drums {{sometimes}} with a machine, then <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>writing</b> lyrics, then we all start jamming on the song. It took us about one year to make so we could make sure it sounded the way we wanted it to sound. Actually, we’re already writing a new record (laughs).|$|R
5000|$|... “That’s hard to {{say because}} the {{research}} is mostly something that is happening while I am writing. There are some cases where I know ahead of time that I’m {{going to have a}} lot of research in a particular area, and <b>I</b> will actually <b>start</b> researching before <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>writing.</b> But with something like Bobby Dollar where it’s set in the contemporary world, yes, there are many things to be researched including things about Heaven and Hell and people’s ideas and the religious writings about them—but most of that I was doing as I was writing. So in a given day, if I’m spending three hours thinking before <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>writing,</b> and two or three hours actually typing, I’m probably going to be spending another hour or so checking things, looking things up, as I go, because I don’t want to try to think too much ahead, I want to be in the scene, in the story… if it takes me six months to write a book, or a year, then I have probably spent a month or two months just doing research.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Meena is a feminist. From {{one of her}} interviews, [...] "Why {{are women}} in the centre? Not the man but the woman. For me, women are in the centre, whether I like it or not. It’s {{possibly}} linked to the feminist perspective that I have always had. Somehow when <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>writing</b> <b>I</b> find that it’s the women who take centre stage, the men are either not very nice guys (laughs) or are incidental." ...|$|R
500|$|The Sea {{contains}} songs {{written before}} and after the death of Rae's husband, all of which she said resonated with her: [...] "The circumstances have cast it all in a different light. It began as a '{{before and after}}' record, but it's become an 'after' record". The ballad [...] "I'd Do It All Again" [...] was written by Rae in January 2008 after an argument with her husband. She told NME that writing the rest of the album helped her handle the different emotions she felt after her husband's death: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> that I was thinking, 'I don't really want this song to go into the world, 'cause it's so naked…' But I had to". [...] "I Would Like to Call it Beauty", she said, was written about finding beauty in the [...] "darkest times", later telling journalist Sean O'Hagan: ...|$|E
500|$|Although Milian was a {{songwriter}} since her teenagers years, she only felt real growth during the production sessions when Dre told her, [...] "there are no rules". Previously, Milian would write songs that followed rules, {{where she would}} have a hook, a verse, and another verse with similar sound and melody. For So Amazin, she wrote with a [...] "no rules theory", which was her biggest obstacle while recording the album. She said, [...] "It was just, you know what? I can change up the melody I can do different things. Sometimes I might get stuck but wait half an hour and it'll come to you and end up being hot. So that's probably my biggest obstacle, just stepping away from doing the usual that I know and stepping into something new. Once I got past all that, it was just easy. With flying colors, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> all the records." ...|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{has written}} songs with and for {{numerous}} artists, including Mick Thomas, Geyer, Kate Ceberano, Vika and Linda Bull, Nick Cave, Nick Barker, Kasey Chambers, Yothu Yindi, Archie Roach, Gyan, Monique Brumby, Kelly Willis, Missy Higgins, and Troy Cassar-Daley. He has described how some songs he writes are suited to other vocal ranges. [...] "Quite often, I'm {{trying to write}} {{a certain kind of}} song and it's more ambitious than what my voice will get to. That's how <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> songs with other people in mind". Kelly and Carmody's [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow" [...] was analysed by Sydney University's Linguistics professor James R Martin. [...] " [...] render the story as a narrative ... with the familiar Orientation, Complication, Evaluation, Resolution and Coda staging". Martin finds that Kelly and Carmody made the point that when people exert their rights with support from friends, they may defeat those with prestige.|$|E
5000|$|Barrett {{relocated}} to the Gold Coast and released an eight-track EP, Simple but Effective, in May 2006 {{on his own}} label, B-Style Entertainment. He described his song writing style [...] "I used to, when <b>I</b> first <b>started,</b> <b>write</b> rhymes {{all over the place}} on bits of paper and then try to match it up with beats later. Now, what I do is get beats from Syllabolix and I listen to the beats first for a few months and I work out the feel of the beats. At the same time I'm dreaming up song titles and subject matter, and things I want to talk about. I match them all up and <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>writing</b> over the beat." [...] He performed at the Rosemount Hotel in Perth at an All Stars gig following the Robert Hunter Cup in October 2014.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with series creator Reki Kawahara, the author noted that the female characters in Sword Art Online were not based on anyone he knew personally, with him stating [...] "I don't usually make a character, setting, or anything before <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>writing.</b> As <b>I</b> write the story, the girls become what they are now. So, somehow, I don't know exactly, but somehow, my subliminal idea or some hidden emotion creates the characters {{to be strong and}} capable." ...|$|R
5000|$|Keen's 1998 album, Walking Distance {{included}} a sequel, [...] "Happy Holidays Y'all". Keen states, [...] "I vowed when <b>I</b> really <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> songs that I'd never write a sequel. But I thought, well, you know, why not." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} {{supposed}} to be released in late 2007, but Carey spoke about reason the album got delayed: [...] "You can't really put records out in December if you want the whole world {{to have a chance to}} actually hear it, [...] my fans all over the world are very important to me", adding that she also wants to put out a pair of singles before the album drops. In a separate interview, she elaborated further: [...] "This happened to me with The Emancipation of Mimi, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> more songs, I was like okay let me get these done, then I wrote four more songs and you know how it goes, so now I'm like 22 songs in and clearly I have to cut some of those down". It was then reported that the album will be released in February 2008. However, the release was later pushed back yet again to April 2008.|$|E
500|$|During the two-month American tour, {{the band}} became {{increasingly}} unhappy, often venting frustrations on each other, leading to several physical confrontations. The band members were homesick; Albarn said, [...] "I {{just started to}} miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> songs which created an English atmosphere." [...] Upon the group's return to Britain, Blur (Albarn in particular) were upset by the success rival group Suede had achieved while they were gone. After a poor performance at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received set by Suede on the same bill, Blur {{were in danger of}} being dropped by Food. By that time, Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana. Although sceptical of Albarn's new manifesto for Blur, Balfe gave assent for the band's choice of Andy Partridge (of XTC) to produce their follow-up to Leisure. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.|$|E
500|$|The {{first song}} she wrote was [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{and in an}} {{interview}} with Faze, she revealed that writing songs in English proved to be challenging for her: [...] "I prayed and asked God to send me a good song today, and I remember <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] After completing [...] "Objection (Tango)", Shakira decided to write ten more songs and began setting up portable recording studios in the rural region of Uruguay. She wrote various songs with a [...] "dictionary {{in one hand and a}} thesaurus in the other." [...] During the songwriting process, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa. She explained that, [...] "If you check the subject of my songs, most of them talk about my own experiences and feelings and what I was actually going through in my life." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "When I am {{in between}} records, {{sometimes}} I doubt myself. I'll be like 'Did I just get lucky, or did I mass-manipulate {{the world into}} thinking that seven songs were worth a number-one position?' And then I {{go back into the}} studio and <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>writing,</b> and the true essential oil of who I am comes bubbling back up and reminds me that it's always been inside of me, that nobody can take this away no matter what comment anyone makes."

500|$|American singer Gloria Estefan, {{whose husband}} Emilio Estefan was {{managing}} Shakira at that time, felt that Shakira {{had the potential}} to crossover into the mainstream pop industry. However, Shakira was initially hesitant to record songs in English as it was not her first language, so Estefan offered to translate [...] "Ojos Así" [...] into English in order to show her that [...] "it could translate well." [...] Shakira then began translating the song herself and showed it to Estefan, who responded [...] "Quite honestly, I can't do this better!." [...] As Shakira wanted to have full control over her recordings, she decided to learn English better to enable her to write her own songs. Wanting to [...] "find a way to express my ideas and my feelings, my day-to-day stories in English", Shakira bought rhyming dictionaries, started analysing the lyrics of songs by Bob Dylan, reading poetry and the work of authors like Leonard Cohen and Walt Whitman and took English lessons from a private tutor. [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] became the first song Shakira wrote in English and in an interview with Faze, she talked about the writing process of the song, saying [...] "I prayed and asked God to send me a good song today, and I remember <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> the song [...] a couple of hours after. I wrote the music and lyrics at the same time, and when that happens it's really magical to me." [...] Shakira also wrote and recorded a Spanish-version of the song entitled [...] "Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)".|$|E
2500|$|Stern recalls that, [...] "CPL {{started out}} as Bob's sale catalog. Bob was drawing the covers and {{including}} little reviews written by some of his customers. By issue #5, {{it turned into a}} small 'zine with a catalog insert, and <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> short articles for it. I eventually became an editor of sorts." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{discovering}} {{they were}} £60,000 in debt, Blur toured the United States in 1992 {{in an attempt}} to recoup their financial losses. During the two-month American tour, Albarn, along with the band, became increasingly unhappy and homesick. [...] "I just started to miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> songs which created an English atmosphere", Albarn revealed.|$|E
5000|$|... "Why did <b>I</b> <b>start</b> <b>writing?</b> The {{price of}} pork and beans made it necessary. I just got hungry enough, {{which is always}} a good thing for beginners. I was in New York and I knew Jeff Hanley, a red haired {{reporter}} on a paper there. I would pound out stuff on the typewriter and Jeff would come home, look my stuff over, say it was rotten, which it was, and make me go ahead doing more of it. Finally, under the stint of his irony I wrote a story and sold it to Frank Munsey." [...] — Talbot Mundy.|$|R
50|$|On his poetry, Mattar said I didn't {{intend to}} make myself a school when <b>I</b> first <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> poetry; <b>I</b> {{just wanted to say}} the truth... and I did. I now can assure you that readers can tell my poetry without my name been {{attached}} to it.|$|R

2500|$|Boyce {{first learned}} to play the guitar as a young man, but he showed no {{particular}} flair for the instrument, nor an actual desire to become a performer. In his own words: [...] " [...] no desire at all to be anything. I had a love of poetry, and eventually started writing songs without any ambition to build a career. It just happened. <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> songs about local things and it evolved." [...] Nevertheless, in time he became competent enough to perform at local eisteddfodau, {{one of the earliest}} known recordings of his work being [...] "", a folk tune in Welsh which he played at the Dyffryn Lliw eisteddfod in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|The US tour resumed in March {{with the}} band playing three sold-out shows at Radio City Music Hall in New York City from March 18 to March 20. Fleets of trucks were hired to {{transport}} the band's equipment, lighting and wardrobe across {{thousands of miles of}} road over the next three months. During the band's time spent commuting across America, Andrew began writing and playing new material with a guitar. In the Official Inside Story of a Band on the road, Andrew said, [...] "Prior to the Kick tour I'd never written on the road – mainly because I didn't have time I guess. But with Kick <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> with a guitar, and I was kind of proud that I'd taught myself to do that". INXS finished up the second leg of the American tour with a hand-full of shows being played in key cities across the California state, including San Francisco, Fresno and San Diego.|$|E
2500|$|Producer and pianist Sergio George {{helped to}} revive salsa's {{commercial}} {{success in the}} 1990s by mixing salsa with contemporary pop styles with Puerto Rican artists like Tito Nieves, La India, and Marc Anthony. George also produced the Japanese salsa band Orquesta de la Luz. Brenda K. Starr, Son By Four, Víctor Manuelle, and the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan enjoyed crossover success within the Anglo-American pop market with their Latin-influenced hits, usually sung in English. More often than not, clave was not a major consideration in the composing or arranging of these hits. Sergio George is up front and unapologetic about his attitude towards clave: [...] "Though clave is considered, {{it is not always}} {{the most important thing in}} my music. The foremost issue in my mind is marketability. If the song hits, that's what matters. When I stopped trying to impress musicians and started getting in touch with what the people on the street were listening to, <b>I</b> <b>started</b> <b>writing</b> hits. Some songs, especially English ones originating in the United States, are at times impossible to place in clave." [...] As Washburne points out however, a lack of clave awareness does not always get a pass: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "You have to {{also get}} out of {{thinking}} that your life is {{the most interesting thing}} you have to write about. I had to write about myself when <b>I</b> <b>started</b> out, it was therapy. But the older I got the more I realized that my life isn't that interesting, so <b>I</b> <b>started</b> to <b>write</b> about other stuff." ...|$|R
60|$|Let me admit, as <b>I</b> <b>start</b> to <b>write,</b> {{that the}} whole thing is my own fault. I should never have come. I knew better. I have known better for years. I have known that it is sheer madness to go and pay visits in other people's houses.|$|R
5000|$|... "Days of No Trust"“Half of {{this song}} {{was written in}} Switzerland after we’d {{finished}} recording the 'VIGILANTE' album at Montreux and that LP was being mixed.
