40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{which is}} the best route of administration for cell therapy in experimental rat model of small-for size syndrome. METHODS: A total of 40 rats underwent partial hepatectomy (70 %) that induces the small-for-size syndrome and were divided into four groups of route administration: intravenous, intraperitoneal, enteral and tracheal. The small-for-size syndrome model was designed with extended partial hepatectomy (70 %). The animals were divided into four <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>routes</b> administration: intravenous (n= 10) - intravenously through the dorsal vein of the penis; intraperitoneal (n= 10) - intraperitoneally in the abdominal cavity; enteral (n= 10) - oroenteral with the placement of a number 4 urethral probe and maintained at third duodenal portion; tracheal (n= 10) - after tracheal intubation. We track the animals and monitor them for 21 days; during this follow-up we evaluated the result of cell therapy application tracking animals using ultrasound, radiography and PET-scan. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism Software(r). Differences were considered significant with the p< 0. 05. Data are presented as the median and variation for continuous variables. Comparisons between groups were made using analysis of the imaging test by the researchers. RESULTS: All four groups underwent partial hepatectomy of 70 % liver tissue targeting the same weight of resected liver. Initially the PET-scan tests showed similarity in administered cells by different routes. However, in few days the route of intravenous administration showed to be the most appropriated to lead cells to the liver followed by enteral. The tracheal and peritoneal routes were not as much successful for this goal. CONCLUSION: The intravenous route is the best one to cell therapy in experimental rat model of small-for size-syndrome...|$|E

5000|$|Rastrillada de los chilenos or Camino de los chilenos (Spanish {{for road}} of the Chileans) were a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>routes</b> in Patagonia used by Mapuches and related araucanized tribes to head cattle stolen during malones from Argentina to Chile across the Andes. Camino de los chilenos ran {{a length of}} about 1000 km from the Buenos Aires Province to the {{mountain}} passes of Neuquén Province. The cattle were traded in Chile for weapons and alcoholic beverages. This trade has been pointed out as {{the single most important}} cause of the war that affected the southern provinces of Argentina during large parts of the 19th century. Therefore, the demand for cattle by Chilean merchants was fueling the conflict in Argentina. To counter the cattle raids a trench called Zanja de Alsina was built by Argentina in the pampas in the 1870s. The use <b>of</b> this trade <b>route</b> effectivelly ended with the Conquest of the Desert (1876-1878) carried out by the Argentine Army.|$|R

50|$|After the Huanggang port began 24/7 service, {{the number}} of {{passengers}} per day quickly increased from 50 thousand to 110 thousand per day, up {{to a maximum of}} 172,000.

To solve this problem, the authorities in Guangdong and Hong Kong agreed to provide a combined service of long and short-term buses.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} development of a surround sound controller prototype application for the Apple iPhone and iPad (iOS) for the users of Apollo Creative’s ‘Ensemble’ system. ‘Ensemble’ is an interactive audio, lighting and video software and hardware package. It allows users to design multi-sensory environments and software instruments reacting to a range of input sensors. The users are primarily music therapists and special needs specialists. The iOS application functionality and user interface is designed primarily to accommodate Ensemble users but the study additionally explores complex functionality for advanced users such as composers and sound designers. Some of the features of the application allow users to: position multiple speakers arbitrarily in a 2 D environment; adjust the volume of a single or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> speakers; <b>route</b> sound source inputs; directly position sound; automate positioning by drawing pan trajectories; play back and manipulate the pan trajectories in a complex way including the use of touch gestures; further automate using multiple path layers. The software incorporates the OpenFrameworks library and communicates wirelessly with a Max/MSP spatialiser, using the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol via control messages. Surround sound panning is controlled using Distance-Based Amplitude Panning to allow arbitrary speaker and listener positions.

PARTICIPANTS: 505 women aged over 18 years with a positive HIV antibody test entered the study between June 1992 and August 1995, with outcome data available for 503 women, and 1208 woman years of follow up to April 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AIDS defining conditions, incidence of AIDS, and death. RESULTS: 120 women (24 %) had AIDS at entry to the study. There were 99 incident AIDS cases and 132 deaths during 1208 woman years of follow up. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was the commonest first AIDS defining condition in white women (31 % of AIDS cases), followed by oesophageal candidiasis (19 %) while tuberculosis was the most common first AIDS defining condition among black African women (24 % of AIDS cases), followed by oesophageal candidiasis (19 %). In multivariate analyses, rate of progression to AIDS was significantly related to CD 4 lymphocyte count at entry and PCP prophylaxis, but not to ethnic <b>group,</b> <b>route</b> <b>of</b> HIV transmission, alcohol, smoking, or oral contraceptive use. Mortality from all causes was not significantly different in women infected through injecting drugs (adjusted ratio 1. 1, 95 % confidence interval 0. 7 - 1. 8) compared with those infected through sexual intercourse, and non-significantly lower in black African women (0. 7, 0. 3 - 1. 2) compared with white women. Survival was not significantly related to smoking, alcohol, or oral contraceptive use.
