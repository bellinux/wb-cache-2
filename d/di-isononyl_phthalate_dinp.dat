40|$|AbstractWhile {{conducting}} an inspection project on counterfeit drugs in 2011, the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (FDA) discovered a probiotic product that was contaminated with the plasticizer di-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). After a thorough investigation, it was {{confirmed that the}} plasticizer had been deliberately added to the clouding agent as a substitute for an emulsifier. The illegal use of DEHP contaminated a broad range of foods and nutraceutical products. Subsequent investigation revealed that another plasticizer, <b>di-isononyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DINP),</b> was also used. Some contaminated food and beverages had already been exported abroad. This caused panic in the public in Taiwan and drew international attention. The government thus initiated emergency response actions for this food safety incident. Actions were undertaken to perform food source control, to strengthen monitoring and surveillance of the production and marketing chain, to adopt a proactive approach in communicating with the public, and to trade in a highly transparent manner. The Act Governing Food Sanitation was also revised to impose harsher penalties on unscrupulous companies and thereby ensure food safety with more consolidated and stricter regulation. The effort has regained the consumer confidence in Taiwanese products...|$|E

40|$|The {{variability}} and {{predictors of}} urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites in preschool-aged children {{have not been}} thoroughly examined. Additionally, the impact of temporal changes in the use and restriction of phthalates in children's products has not been assessed. Our objective was to identify demographic, behavioral, and temporal predictors of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in young children. Between 2004 and 2011, we collected up to five urine samples from each of 296 children participating in a prospective birth cohort during annual study visits at ages 1 - 5 years. We used linear mixed models to calculate intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), a measure of within-individual reproducibility, and identify demographic predictors of urinary phthalate metabolites. We used multivariable linear regression to examine cross-sectional relationships between food packaging or personal care product use and phthalate metabolites measured at age 5 years. Across annual measurements, monoethyl phthalate exhibited the least variation (ICC = 0. 38), while di- 2 -ethylhexyl phthalate (3 DEHP) metabolites exhibited the most variation (ICC = 0. 09). Concentrations changed with age, suggesting age-related changes in phthalate exposure and perhaps metabolism. Our findings suggest that fast food consumption may {{be a source of}} butylbenzyl phthalate and <b>di-isononyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DiNP)</b> exposure, and some personal care products may be sources of diethyl phthalate exposure. Concentrations of 3 DEHP metabolites decreased over the study period; however, concentrations of DiNP metabolites increased. This finding suggests that manufacturer practices and regulations, like the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, may decrease DEHP exposure, but additional work characterizing the nature and toxicity of replacements is critically needed.

It generally is manufactured with an addition of additives such as plasticisers to improve its functionality and facilitate its production process. PVC that can contain up to 50 % by weight of plasticisers (Simoneau et al., 2001). Among plasticisers, 90 % of the most commonly used to soften polymers for toys production are constituted by phthalates, such as diisononyl phthalate (DINP). The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the influence of the relative concentration of percentage of phthalates and nature of phthalates on their release in standard conditions. To obtain a suitable but rapid method of analysis, experiments were performed to study the effects on the modification of a standard operation procedure (SOP) previously validated at the EU level by JRC Ispra. A single extraction with a sufficient large volume of cyclohexane thus could be used instead of two extractions with a smaller volume of cyclohexane and resulted in more rapid yet reliable method. The final method is described in Annex 1 of this report. Samples of soft PVC were industrially produced especially for this study. Standard PVC disks with various percentages of <b>di-isononyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DINP),</b> di-isodecyl phthalate (DIDP), di-ethyl-hexyll phthalate	 (DEHP), benzylbutyl phthalate (BBP) dibutylphthalate (DBP) or a binary mixture DINP/DBP in various proportions were prepared. 30 different types of disk were produced and tested. The disks were analysed for contents, homogeneity and sets were subjected to migration experiments of the various phthalates under dynamic conditions using the previously validated SOP with some modifications. The release from samples with a systematic manufacturing process and containing different phthalates at different concentrations showed correlations to their concentrations. Since previous studies using commercial toys had no showed such specific trends, these results suggest that the production process of toys may be an important issue with respect to release properties. The release of DEHP BBP and DBP tended to show a more linear correlation to the concentration, whereas for DINP, DIDP, DEHP and release the plasticiser showed non linear tendencies and saturation of release for high formulation contents.

MethodsThe plasticizers contained in the MDs used for daily care in the Obstetrics Department of a French University Hospital were extracted from PVC (after contact with a chloroform solution), identified and quantified by gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry analysis. A total of 168 pregnant women hospitalised in the Obstetrics Department with at least one catheter were included in the observational study. The median number of MDs containing plasticizers used and the daily duration of exposure to the MDs were compared in three groups of pregnant women: “Pathology group” (women hospitalised for an obstetric disorder who did not give birth during this hospitalisation; n = 52), “Pathology and delivery group” (hospitalised for an obstetric disorder and who gave birth during this stay; n = 23) and “Delivery group” (admitted for planned or spontaneous delivery without obstetric disorder; n = 93). ResultsDiNP, TOTM and DINCH were the predominant plasticizers contained in the MDs at an amount of 29 to 36 g per 100 g of PVC.

In this study we analyzed 300 urine samples from the years 2007 to 2015 for 21 phthalate metabolites (representing exposure to 11 parent phthalates) and combined the data with two previous retrospective measurement campaigns (1988 to 2003 and 2002 to 2008). The combined dataset comprised 1162 24 -h urine samples spanning the years 1988 to 2015. With this detailed set of human biomonitoring data we describe {{the time course of}} phthalate exposure in Germany over a time frame of 27 years. For the metabolites of the endocrine disrupting phthalates di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP) and butylbenzyl phthalate (BBzP) we observed a roughly ten-fold decline in median metabolite levels from their peak levels in the late 1980 s/early 1990 s compared to most recent levels from 2015. Probably, bans (first enacted in 1999) and classifications/labelings (enacted in 2001 and 2004) in the European Union lead to this drop. A decline in di-isobutyl phthalate (DiBP) metabolite levels set in only quite recently, possibly due to its later classification as a reproductive toxicant in the EU in 2009. In a considerable number of samples collected before 2002 health based guidance values (BE, HBM I) have been exceeded for DnBP (27. 2 %) and DEHP (2. 3 %) but also in recent samples some individual exceedances can still be observed (DEHP 1. 0 %). A decrease in concentration for all low molecular weight phthalates, labelled or not, was seen in the most recent years of sampling. For the high molecular weight phthalates, DEHP seems to have been substituted in part by <b>di-isononyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DiNP),</b> but DiNP metabolite levels have also been declining in the last years. Probably, non-phthalate alternatives increasingly take over for the phthalates in Germany. A comparison with NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) data from the United States covering the years 1999 to 2012 revealed both similarities and differences in phthalate exposure between Germany and the US. Exposure to critical phthalates has decreased in both countries with metabolite levels more and more aligning with each other, but high molecular weight phthalates substituting DEHP (such as DiNP) seem to become more important in the US than in Germany...|$|E

Traditionally, assessment of human exposure to DINP has been done using monoisononyl phthalate (MINP), the hydrolytic metabolite of DINP, as a biomarker.

Oxidative metabolites, including mono(carboxyisooctyl) phthalate (MCIOP), mono(oxoisononyl) phthalate (MOINP), and mono(hydroxyisononyl) phthalate (MHINP) are the major urinary metabolites in DINP-dosed rats. The urinary concentrations of MINP, MCIOP, MOINP, and MHINP were measured in 129 adult anonymous human volunteers with no known exposure to DINP. Although MINP was not present at detectable levels {{in any of the}} samples analyzed, MCIOP, MHINP, and MOINP were detected in 97, 100, and 87 % of the urine samples at geometric mean levels equal to 8. 6, 11. 4, and 1. 2 ng/mL, respectively. The concentrations of all three oxidative metabolites were highly correlated with each other (p < 0. 0001), which confirms a common precursor. MCIOP was excreted predominantly as a free species, whereas MOINP was excreted mostly in its glucuronidated form. The percentage of MHINP excreted either glucuronidated or in its free form was similar. The significantly higher frequency of detection and urinary concentrations of oxidative metabolites than of MINP suggest that these oxidative metabolites are better biomarkers of exposure assessment of DINP than is MINP. Therefore, we concluded that the prevalence of human exposure to DINP is underestimated by using MINP as the sole DINP urinary biomarker...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—It is the {{worldwide}} {{problem that the}} recycled PVB is not recycled and it is wildly stored in landfills. However, PVB has similar chemical properties such as PVC. Moreover, both of these polymers are plasticized. Therefore, the study of thermal properties of plasticized PVC and the recycled PVB obtained by recycling of windshields is carried out. This work has done {{in order to find}} non-degradable processing conditions applicable for both polymers. Tested PVC contained 38 % of plasticizer diisononyl <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DINP)</b> and PVB was plasticized with 28 % of triethylene glycol, bis(2 -ethylhexanoate) (3 GO). The thermal and thermo-oxidative decomposition of both vinyl polymers are compared by calorimetric analysis and by tensile strength analysis.

40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical investigation {{has been made}} into the mechanical behaviour of two poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) polymers – an un-plasticized PVC and a diisononyl <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DINP)</b> -plasticized PVC. Measurements of the compressive stress-strain behaviour of the PVCs at strain rates ranging from 10 − 3 to 103 s− 1 and temperatures from − 60 to 100 ∘C are presented. Dynamic Mechanical Analysis was also performed {{in order to understand}} the material transitions observed in compression testing as the strain rate is increased. This investigation develops a better understanding of the interplay between the temperature dependence and rate dependence of polymers, with a focus on locating the temperature and rate-dependent material transitions that occur during high rate testing...|$|R
40|$|A 2011 {{publication}} by Boberg et al. entitled “Reproductive {{and behavioral}} effects of diisononyl <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DINP)</b> in perinatally exposed rats” [1] reported statistically {{significant changes in}} sperm parameters, testicular histopathology, anogenital distance and retained nipples in developing males. Using the statistical methods as reported by Boberg et al. (2011) [1], we reanalyzed the publically available raw data ([dataset] US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency), 2016) [2]. The output of our reanalysis and the discordances with the data as published in Boberg et al. (2011) [1] are highlighted herein. Further discussion of {{the basis for the}} replication discordances and the insufficiency of the Boberg et al. (2011) [1] response to address them {{can be found in a}} companion letter of correspondence (doi: 10. 1016 /j. reprotox. 2017. 03. 013.; (Morfeld et al., 2011) [3]) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{mechanical}} properties of blends consisting of plasticized poly(vinyl butyral) (PVB) and plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) are studied, {{in order to}} evaluate {{the possibility of using}} recycled PVB waste derived from windshields. PVC was plasticized with 38 % of diisononyl <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DINP),</b> while PVB was plasticized with 28 % of triethylene glycol, bis(2 -ethylhexanoate) (3 GO). The optimal process conditions for the PVB/PVC blend in 1 : 1 ratio were determined. Entropy was used in order to theoretically predict the blends miscibility. The PVB content of each blend composition used was ranging from zero to 100 %. Tensile strength and strain were tested. In addition, a comparison between recycled and original PVB, used as constituents of the blend, was performed.

5000|$|In another {{development}} in 1986, California voters approved an initiative {{to address their}} growing concerns about exposure to toxic chemicals. That initiative became the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known by its original name of Proposition 65. In December 2013 DINP was listed as a chemical [...] "known to the State of California to cause cancer" [...] This means that, starting December 2014, companies with 10 or more employees manufacturing, distributing or selling the product(s) containing diisononyl <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DINP)</b> are required to provide a clear and reasonable warning for that product. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, charged with maintaining the Proposition 65 list and enforcing its provisions, has implemented a [...] "No Significant Risk Level" [...] of 146 ug/day for DINP, as of 1 April 2016.|$|R
50|$|Concerns about {{chemicals}} ingested {{by children}} when chewing plastic toys prompted the European Commission {{to order a}} temporary ban on phthalates in 1999, the decision of {{which is based on}} an opinion by the Commission’s Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (CSTEE). A proposal to make the ban permanent was tabled. Until 2004, EU banned the use of DEHP along with several other <b>phthalates</b> (DBP, BBP, <b>DINP,</b> DIDP and DNOP) in toys for young children. In 2005, the Council and the Parliament compromised to propose a ban on three types of <b>phthalates</b> (<b>DINP,</b> DIDP, and DNOP) “in toys and childcare articles which can be placed in the mouth by children”. Therefore, more products than initially planned will thus be affected by the directive. In 2008, six substances were considered to be of very high concern (SVHCs) and added to the Candidate List including Musk Xylene, MDA, HBCDD, DEHP, BBP, and DBP. In 2011, those six substances have been listed for Authorization in Annex XIV of REACH by Regulation (EU) No 143/2011. According to the regulation, phthalates including DEHP, BBP and DBP will be banned from February 2015.|$|R
40|$|The {{environmental}} analysis of phthalates is established and widespread with most classical methods based on gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Attention has recently {{turned to the}} analysis of di-isononylphthalate (DiNP) and di-isodecylphthalate (DiDP) but their analysis by GC results in an unresolved cluster of peaks that all predominantly fragment to the phthalic anhydride ion at m/z = 149. Consequently, quantification of DiNP and DiDP using the most abundant ion is impossible and the same sensitivity as for the single isomer phthalates cannot be reached. GC combined with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) was used to analyse the high-molecular-weight <b>phthalates.</b> <b>DiNP</b> and DiDP were successfully ionized in proton transfer mode yielding spectra that contained the molecular ion as the base peak. The method was also applied to measure DiNP and DiDP in a sediment extract at relevant levels for environment samples...|$|R
