5|$|Rhodium is a <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> of uranium-235; therefore, each {{kilogram}} of <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> {{contains a}} significant amount of the lighter platinum group metals including rhodium. Used nuclear fuel is a potential source of rhodium. However, the extraction is complex and expensive, and the presence of rhodium radioisotopes requires a period of cooling storage for multiple half-lives of the longest-lived isotope (about 10 years). These factors make the source unattractive and no large-scale extraction has been attempted.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 In {{consideration}} of the potential use of minor actinides in nuclear fuel, the <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> of several minor actinides (²³⁷Np, ²⁴¹Am, ²⁴²[superscript m]Am, ²⁴³Cm, ²⁴⁴Cm, ²⁴⁵Cm, and ²⁴⁶Cm) were evaluated and compared to the <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> of ²³⁵U. Available data from the Evaluated Nuclear Data File and the Nuclear Database were {{used in conjunction with}} Environmental Protection Agency risk estimates and the Radiological Safety Analysis program to estimate several risks from the various <b>fission</b> <b>products.</b> Results show that some minor actinides produce <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> whose estimated risks are greater than the risks from <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> of ²³⁵U in a number of cases...|$|R
50|$|All fission {{reactions}} generate <b>fission</b> <b>products,</b> {{the remains}} of the split atomic nuclei. Many <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> are either highly radioactive (but short-lived) or moderately radioactive (but long-lived), and as such, they are a serious form of radioactive contamination if not fully contained. <b>Fission</b> <b>products</b> are the principal radioactive component of nuclear fallout.|$|R
50|$|About 1.5 {{billion years}} ago in a uranium ore body in Africa, a natural nuclear fission reactor {{operated}} for a few hundred thousand years and produced approximately 5 tonnes of <b>fission</b> <b>products.</b> These <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> were important in providing proof that the natural reactor had occurred.Fission products are produced in nuclear weapon explosions, with the amount {{depending on the type of}} weapon.The largest source of <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> is from nuclear reactors. In current nuclear power reactors, about 3% of the uranium in the fuel is converted into <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> as a by-product of energy generation. Most of these <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> remain in the fuel unless there is fuel element failure or a nuclear accident, or the fuel is reprocessed.|$|R
5|$|As {{also noted}} below, {{the most common}} isotopic {{molybdenum}} application involves molybdenum-99, which is a <b>fission</b> <b>product.</b> It is a parent radioisotope to the short-lived gamma-emitting daughter radioisotope technetium-99m, a nuclear isomer used in various imaging applications in medicine.|$|E

5|$|Since that discovery, {{there have}} been many {{searches}} in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium. In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the Belgian Congo in extremely small quantities (about 0.2ng/kg); there it originates as a spontaneous <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> of uranium-238. The Oklo natural nuclear fission reactor contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium-99 were produced and have since decayed into ruthenium-99.|$|E
50|$|The {{capture of}} {{neutrons}} by short half-life <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> {{is known as}} reactor poisoning; neutron capture by long-lived or stable <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> is called reactor slagging.|$|R

40|$|Argonne National Laboratory is {{developing}} a ceramic waste form to immobilize salt containing <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> and transuranic elements. Preliminary results have been presented for ceramic waste forms containing surrogate <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> such as cesium and the lanthanides. In this work results from scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction are presented in greater detail for ceramic waste forms containing surrogate <b>fission</b> <b>products.</b> Additionally, results for waste forms containing plutonium and surrogate <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> are presented. Most of the surrogate <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> appear to be silicates or aluminosilicates whereas the plutonium is usually found in an oxide form.

5|$|Technetium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Tc and atomic number 43. It is the lightest element whose isotopes are all radioactive; none are stable. Nearly all technetium is produced synthetically, and only minute amounts {{are found in}} the Earth's crust. Naturally occurring technetium is a spontaneous <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> in uranium ore or the product of neutron capture in molybdenum ores. The chemical properties of this silvery gray, crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{possible}} sources for natural promethium: rare decays of natural europium-151 (producing promethium-147), and uranium (various isotopes). Practical applications exist only for chemical compounds of promethium-147, {{which are used}} in luminous paint, atomic batteries and thickness measurement devices, even though promethium-145 is the most stable promethium isotope. Because natural promethium is exceedingly scarce, it is typically synthesized by bombarding uranium-235 (enriched uranium) with thermal neutrons to produce promethium-147 as a <b>fission</b> <b>product.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Working with physicist Alvin Weinberg, Way analyzed {{neutron flux}} data from Enrico Fermi's early nuclear reactor designs to see whether {{it would be possible to}} create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. These calculations were put to use in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Afterwards, she examined the problem of nuclear poisoning of reactors by certain fission products. With physicist Eugene Wigner she developed the Way-Wigner approximation for <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> decay.|$|E
50|$|Nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> are {{the atomic}} {{fragments}} left after a large atomic nucleus undergoes nuclear fission. Typically, a large nucleus {{like that of}} uranium fissions by splitting into two smaller nuclei, {{along with a few}} neutrons, the release of heat energy (kinetic energy of the nuclei), and gamma rays. The two smaller nuclei are the <b>fission</b> <b>products.</b> (See also <b>Fission</b> <b>products</b> (by element)).|$|R
50|$|Other <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> with {{relatively}} high {{absorption cross sections}} include 83Kr, 95Mo, 143Nd, 147Pm. Above this mass, even many even-mass number isotopes have large absorption cross sections, allowing one nucleus to serially absorb multiple neutrons.Fission of heavier actinides produces more of the heavier <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> in the lanthanide range, so the total neutron absorption cross section of <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> is higher.|$|R
50|$|Some {{radioactive}} <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> can {{be converted}} into shorter-lived radioisotopes by transmutation. Transmutation of all <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> with half-life greater than one year is studied in Grenoble, with varying results.|$|R
5|$|In September 1944, Wu was {{contacted}} by the Manhattan District Engineer, Colonel Kenneth Nichols. The newly commissioned B Reactor at the Hanford Site had run into an unexpected problem, starting up and shutting down at regular intervals. John Archibald Wheeler suspected that a <b>fission</b> <b>product,</b> xenon-135, with a half-life of 9.4 hours, was the culprit, and might be a neutron poison. Segrè then remembered the work that Wu had done at Berkeley on the radioactive isotopes of xenon. The paper on the subject was still unpublished, but Wu and Nichols went to her dorm room, and collected the typewritten draft prepared for the Physical Review. Xenon-135 was indeed the culprit; {{it turned out to}} have an unexpectedly large neutron absorption cross-section.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E
5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut down once more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.|$|E
5000|$|Only seven <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> {{have long}} half-lives, {{and these are}} much longer than 30 years, {{in the range of}} 200,000 to 16 million years. These are known as {{long-lived}} <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> (LLFP). Two or three have relatively high yields of about 6%, while the rest appear at much lower yields. (This list of seven excludes isotopes with very slow decay and half-lives longer than the age of the universe, which are effectively stable and already found in nature; as well as a few nuclides like technetium-98 and samarium-146 that are [...] "shadowed" [...] from beta decay and can only occur as direct <b>fission</b> <b>products,</b> not as beta decay products of more neutron-rich initial <b>fission</b> <b>products.</b> The shadowed <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> have yields on the order of one millionth as much as iodine-129.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Fission</b> <b>products</b> have half-lives of 90 years (samarium-151) or less, {{except for}} seven {{long-lived}} <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> that have half lives of 211,100 years (technetium-99) and more. Therefore, the total radioactivity of {{a mixture of}} pure <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> decreases rapidly for the first several hundred years (controlled by the short-lived products) before stabilizing at a low level that changes little {{for hundreds of thousands}} of years (controlled by the seven long-lived products).|$|R
5000|$|Contamination of {{the cooling}} circuit with {{metallic}} <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> (Sr-90, Cs-137) {{due to the}} insufficient retention capabilities of fuel pebbles for metallic <b>fission</b> <b>products.</b> Even modern fuel elements do not sufficiently retain strontium and cesium.|$|R
5|$|Natural {{strontium}} is {{a mixture}} of four stable isotopes: 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr. Their abundance increases with increasing mass number and the heaviest, 88Sr, makes up about 82.6% of all natural strontium, though the abundance varies due to the production of radiogenic 87Sr as the daughter of long-lived beta-decaying 87Rb. Of the unstable isotopes, the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 85Sr is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium, and that of the isotopes heavier than 88Sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium. Of special note are 89Sr and 90Sr. The former has a half-life of 50.6days and is used to treat bone cancer due to strontium's chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium. While 90Sr (half-life 28.90years) has been used similarly, it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its production as a <b>fission</b> <b>product.</b> Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated about 30,000km2 with greater than 10 kBq/m2 with 90Sr, which accounts for 5% of the core inventory of 90Sr.|$|E
5|$|The other iodine radioisotopes {{have much}} shorter half-lives, {{no longer than}} days. Some of them have medical {{applications}} involving the thyroid gland, where the iodine that enters the body is stored and concentrated. Iodine-123 has a half-life of thirteen hours and decays by electron capture to tellurium-123, emitting gamma radiation; it is used in nuclear medicine imaging, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and X-ray computed tomography (X-Ray CT) scans. Iodine-125 has a half-life of fifty-nine days, decaying by electron capture to tellurium-125 and emitting low-energy gamma radiation; the second-longest-lived iodine radioisotope, it has uses in biological assays, nuclear medicine imaging and in radiation therapy as brachytherapy to treat a number of conditions, including prostate cancer, uveal melanomas, and brain tumours. Finally, iodine-131, with a half-life of eight days, beta decays to an excited state of stable xenon-131 that then converts to the ground state by emitting gamma radiation. It is a common <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> and thus is present in high levels in radioactive fallout. It may then be absorbed through contaminated food, and will also accumulate in the thyroid. As it decays, it may cause damage to the thyroid. The primary risk from exposure {{to high levels of}} iodine-131 is the chance occurrence of radiogenic thyroid cancer in later life. Other risks include the possibility of non-cancerous growths and thyroiditis. The usual means of protection against the negative effects of iodine-131 is by saturating the thyroid gland with stable iodine-127 in the form of potassium iodide tablets, taken daily for optimal prophylaxis. However, iodine-131 may also be used for medicinal purposes in radiation therapy for this very reason, when tissue destruction is desired after iodine uptake by the tissue. Iodine-131 is also used as a radioactive tracer.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{short-lived}} <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> is iodine-131, this can also be formed as an activation product by the neutron activation of tellurium.|$|E
25|$|No {{pressure}} buildup from fission. LFTRs are {{not subject}} to pressure buildup of gaseous and volatile <b>fission</b> <b>products.</b> The liquid fuel allows for online removal of gaseous <b>fission</b> <b>products,</b> such as xenon, for processing, thus these decay products would not be spread in a disaster. Further, <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> are chemically bonded to the fluoride-salt, including iodine, cesium, and strontium, capturing the radiation and preventing the spread of radioactive material to the environment.|$|R
50|$|Isotope {{and element}} yields will {{change as the}} <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> undergo beta decay, while chain yields do not change after {{completion}} of neutron emission by a few neutron-rich initial <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> (delayed neutrons), with halflife measured in seconds.|$|R
25|$|Simplified fuel processing. Thorium is {{chemically}} {{similar to}} several <b>fission</b> <b>products,</b> called lanthanides. With thorium {{in a separate}} blanket, thorium is kept isolated from the lanthanides. Without thorium in the core fluid, removal of lanthanide <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> is simplified.|$|R
25|$|Iodine-131 (131I) is an {{important}} radioisotope of iodine discovered by Glenn Seaborg and John Livingood in 1938 at the University of California, Berkeley. It has a radioactive decay half-life of about eight days. It is associated with nuclear energy, medical diagnostic and treatment procedures, and natural gas production. It also {{plays a major role}} as a radioactive isotope present in nuclear fission products, and was a significant contributor to the health hazards from open-air atomic bomb testing in the 1950s, and from the Chernobyl disaster, as well as being a large fraction of the contamination hazard in the first weeks in the Fukushima nuclear crisis. This is because I-131 is a major <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> of uranium and plutonium, comprising nearly 3% of the total products of fission (by weight). See <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> yield for a comparison with other radioactive fission products. I-131 is also a major <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> of uranium-233, produced from thorium.|$|E
25|$|Does not use {{solvents}} containing {{hydrogen and}} carbon, which are neutron moderators creating risk of criticality accidents and can absorb the <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> tritium and the activation product carbon-14 in dilute solutions that cannot be separated later.|$|E
25|$|This {{tendency}} for <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> nuclei to beta-decay {{is the fundamental}} {{cause of the problem}} of radioactive high level waste from nuclear reactors. Fission products tend to be beta emitters, emitting fast-moving electrons to conserve electric charge, as excess neutrons convert to protons in the fission-product atoms. See Fission products (by element) for a description of fission products sorted by element.|$|E
50|$|Enrico Fermi {{described}} an alternative solution: Consume all actinides in fast neutron reactors, leaving only <b>fission</b> <b>products,</b> which require special custody {{for less than}} 300 years. This requires continuous fuel reprocessing. PUREX separates plutonium and uranium, but leaves other actinides with <b>fission</b> <b>products,</b> thereby not addressing the long-term custody problem. Pyroelectric refining, as perfected at EBR-II, separates essentially all actinides from <b>fission</b> <b>products.</b> U.S. DOE Research on pyroelectric refining and fast neutron reactors was stopped in 1994.|$|R
50|$|Fast-neutron {{reactors}} can fission all actinides, {{while the}} thorium fuel cycle produces {{low levels of}} transuranics. Unlike LWRs, in principle these fuel cycles could recycle their plutonium and minor actinides and leave only <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> and activation products as waste. The highly radioactive medium-lived <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> Cs-137 and Sr-90 diminish {{by a factor of}} 10 each century; while the long-lived <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> have relatively low radioactivity, often compared favorably to that of the original uranium ore.|$|R
50|$|The solvent {{stream of}} U, Pu and {{remaining}} <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> then passes {{to the critical}} mixer settler stages where the U and Pu are transferred into the aqueous phase and <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> remains in the aqueous phase. Separation of the U and Pu is achieved by adding a reductant, which causes the Pu, but not the U, to transfer into the solvent phase. Once separated, further removal of <b>fission</b> <b>products</b> is undertaken by more mixer settler units.|$|R
