25|$|Competitors {{criticized the}} realism of Lionel's trains—Cowen had {{been unwilling to}} invest in the {{equipment}} necessary for lithography, so its early offerings were simply painted in solid colors of <b>enamel</b> <b>paint</b> with brass detail parts. Lionel responded by targeting advertising at children, telling them its products were the most realistic toy trains. Additionally, Lionel criticized the durability of competitors' products in ads targeted at parents.|$|E
25|$|In {{all three}} works of The Russian Series {{the details are}} located in the corners or away from the center. The wholeness of the “sandy color, that of soil” is left intact, {{interrupted}} in a discrete manner almost secretively or mistakenly. Yet the dominance of the center overpowers the viewer, returning his gaze to the middle and away from the discrepancies in color. Kabakov would repeat this strategy from 1983-1988 with a second series called Three Green Paintings. In this series, rather than depict objects, he placed texts on the upper left and right hand corners of what is otherwise a field of green <b>enamel</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
500|$|The stress {{fracture}} theory {{was supported by}} the testimony of former crewmen. Former Second Mate Richard Orgel, who served on Fitzgerald in 1972 and 1973, testified that [...] "the ship had a tendency to bend and spring during storms 'like a diving board after somebody has jumped off. Orgel was quoted as saying that the loss of Fitzgerald was caused by hull failure, [...] "pure and simple. I detected undue stress in the side tunnels by examining the white <b>enamel</b> <b>paint,</b> which will crack and splinter when submitted to severe stress." [...] George H. [...] "Red" [...] Burgner, Fitzgeralds steward for ten seasons and winter ship-keeper for seven years, testified in a deposition that a [...] "loose keel" [...] contributed to the vessel's loss. Burgner further testified that [...] "the keel and sister kelsons were only 'tack welded'" [...] and that he had personally observed that many of the welds were broken. Burgner was not asked to testify before the Marine Board of Inquiry.|$|E

50|$|<b>Enamel</b> <b>paints,</b> {{not to be}} {{confused}} with vitreous enamel, are nitro-cellulose based paints originally designed for commercial use, but have also been used in artist's paintings such as Jackson Pollock and Pablo Picasso. <b>Enamel</b> <b>paints</b> are oil, latex, alkyd, and water based. This paint dries rapidly and has a glossy finish once dry.|$|R

2500|$|Sometimes {{container}} factories {{will offer}} {{services such as}} labelling. Several labelling technologies are available. Unique to glass is the Applied Ceramic Labelling process (ACL). This is screen-printing of the decoration onto the container with a vitreous <b>enamel</b> <b>paint,</b> which is then baked on. An {{example of this is}} the original Coca-Cola bottle.

2500|$|Koger and Postuma sanded Clapton's 1964 SG Standard (not, as {{is found}} in various sources, a 1961 model, and not an SG Special) and painted it with {{oil-based}} <b>enamel</b> <b>paint</b> in the [...] "gaudy dayglo colours of the day." [...] As Koger explained, [...] "the single thread running through all of my paintings is nostalgia for paradise." [...] The theme of the SG's design is [...] "good versus evil, heaven versus hell, {{and the power of}} music in the universe to rise above it all as a force of good". The centrepiece on the face is a cherub holding a triangle, surrounded by yellow stars on a celestial blue background ("a Fool hallmark"). The angel's curly hairstyle was inspired by Clapton's hairstyle at the time. Flames come up {{from the bottom of the}} guitar (the bass-bout with the volume and tone controls) and the treble point has rainbow-coloured arcs. The pick guard contains a landscape with mountains and a red sun on the horizon, a [...] "Dutch miniature" [...] representing paradise. On the back, coloured concentric circles are surrounded by coloured waves.|$|E
2500|$|Lieutenant Frederick Woods, the torpedo officer, {{opened the}} test cocks on the tubes. Unfortunately, the test cock on tube number 5 {{was blocked by}} some <b>enamel</b> <b>paint</b> so no water flowed out even though the bow cap was open. Prickers to clear the test cocks had been {{provided}} {{but they were not}} used. This combined with a confusing layout of the bow cap indicators — they were arranged in a vertical line with 5 at the bottom (2,1,4,3,6, and then 5) and the [...] "Shut" [...] position for tube 5 on the dial was the mirror image of tube 6 above it — led to the inner door of the tube being opened. The inrush of water caused the bow of the submarine to sink to the seabed [...] below the surface. How the outer door (bow cap) to Tube 5 became open to the sea is a question that will probably never be answered, Woods maintained that until at least 10 minutes before he opened the tube all the indicators were at [...] "Shut".|$|E

6000|$|One {{feels that}} the thing is being overdone. That family, before another month is gone, {{will be among the}} strongest opponents of <b>enamel</b> <b>paint</b> that the century has produced. <b>Enamel</b> <b>paint</b> will be the ruin of that once happy home. <b>Enamel</b> <b>paint</b> has a cold, glassy, cynical appearance. Its {{presence}} everywhere about the place will begin to irritate the old man {{in the course of a}} week or so. He will call it, [...] "This damn'd sticky stuff!" [...] and will tell the wife that he wonders she didn't paint herself and the children with it while she was about it. She will reply, in an exasperatingly quiet tone of voice, that she does like that. Perhaps he will say next, that she did not warn him against it, and tell him what an idiot he was making of himself, spoiling the whole house with his foolish fads. Each one will persist that it was the other one who first suggested the absurdity, and they will sit up in bed and quarrel about it every night for a month.|$|E
60|$|The eldest daughter's young man, in this {{particular}} case, will, you may depend upon it, choose that exact moment when the baby's life is hovering in the balance, and the cook is waiting for her wages with her box in the hall, and a coal-heaver is {{at the front door}} with a policeman, making a row about the damage to his trousers, to come in, smiling, with a specimen pot of some new high art, squashed-tomato-shade <b>enamel</b> <b>paint,</b> and suggest that they should try it on the old man's pipe.|$|E
6000|$|Too much of {{anything}} is a mistake, as the man said when his wife presented him with four new healthy children in one day. We should practice moderation in all matters. A little <b>enamel</b> <b>paint</b> would have been good. They might have enameled the house inside and out, and have left the furniture alone. Or they might have colored the furniture, and let the house be. But an entirely and completely enameled home--a home, such as enamel-paint manufacturers love to picture on their advertisements, over which the yearning eye wanders in vain, seeking one single square inch of un-enameled matter--is, I am convinced, a mistake. It may be a home that, as the testimonials assure us, will easily wash. It may be an [...] "artistic" [...] home; but the average man is not yet educated up to the appreciation of it. The average man does not care for high art. At a certain point, the average man gets sick of high art.|$|E

5000|$|Typically {{the term}} [...] "enamel paint" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} oil-based covering products, usually with {{a significant amount of}} gloss in them, however recently many latex or water-based paints have adopted the term as well. The term today means [...] "hard surfaced paint" [...] and usually is in reference to paint brands of higher quality, floor coatings of a high gloss finish, or spray <b>paints.</b> Most <b>enamel</b> <b>paints</b> are alkyd resin based. Some <b>enamel</b> <b>paints</b> have been made by adding varnish to oil-based paint.|$|R

6000|$|Before {{the day was}} out {{the whole}} {{enterprise}} was planned. They decided at first that they would call themselves the Naval Mr. O's, a plagiarism, and not perhaps a very good one, from {{the title of the}} well-known troupe of [...] "Scarlet Mr. E's," [...] and Bert rather clung {{to the idea of a}} uniform of bright blue serge, with a lot of gold lace and cord and ornamentation, rather like a naval officer's, but more so. But that had to be abandoned as impracticable, it would have taken too much time and money to prepare. They perceived they must wear some cheaper and more readily prepared costume, and Grubb fell back on white dominoes. They entertained the notion for a time of selecting the two worst machines from the hiring-stock, painting them over with crimson <b>enamel</b> <b>paint,</b> replacing the bells by the loudest sort of motor-horn, and doing a ride about to begin and end the entertainment. They doubted the advisability of this step.|$|E
6000|$|There is {{somewhat}} too much electricity, for my taste, in these worlds to come. One is reminded of those pictorial enamel-paint advertisements that one sees about so often now, {{in which all}} the members of an extensive household are represented as gathered together in one room, spreading enamel-paint over everything they can lay their hands upon. The old man is on a step-ladder, daubing the walls and ceiling with [...] "cuckoo's-egg green," [...] while the parlor-maid and the cook are on their knees, painting the floor with [...] "sealing-wax red." [...] The old lady is doing the picture frames in [...] "terra cotta." [...] The eldest daughter and her young man are making sly love in a corner over a pot of [...] "high art yellow," [...] with which, so soon as they have finished wasting their time, they will, it is manifest, proceed to elevate the piano. Younger brothers and sisters are busy freshening up the chairs and tables with [...] "strawberry-jam pink" [...] and [...] "jubilee magenta." [...] Every blessed thing in that room is being coated with <b>enamel</b> <b>paint,</b> from the sofa to the fire-irons, from the sideboard to the eight-day clock. If there is any paint left over, it will be used up for the family Bible and the canary.|$|E
60|$|For a swift {{season of}} merrymaking the money of his prizes ran through Stephen's fingers. Great parcels of {{groceries}} and delicacies and dried fruits {{arrived from the}} city. Every day he drew up a bill of fare for the family and every night led a party {{of three or four}} to the theatre to see INGOMAR or THE LADY OF LYONS. In his coat pockets he carried squares of Vienna chocolate for his guests while his trousers' pocket bulged with masses of silver and copper coins. He bought presents for everyone, overhauled his room, wrote out resolutions, marshalled his books up and down their shelves, pored upon all kinds of price lists, drew up a form of commonwealth for the household by which every member of it held some office, opened a loan bank for his family and pressed loans on willing borrowers so that he might have the pleasure of making out receipts and reckoning the interests on the sums lent. When he could do no more he drove up and down the city in trams. Then the season of pleasure came to an end. The pot of pink <b>enamel</b> <b>paint</b> gave out and the wainscot of his bedroom remained with its unfinished and ill-plastered coat.|$|E
