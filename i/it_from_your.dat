500|$|Bennion commended the writing, {{saying that}} Pemberton and Shearsmith {{were able to}} subvert {{expectations}} of séances several times; [...] "just as you're smugly congratulating yourself for working out every twist and turn, they pull <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> grasp". Owen praised the writing and subversion of expectations, and, though he found some of the twists predictable and felt that the ending needed more groundwork, felt that the final sequence [...] "was worth it for another brown-trouser moment". Bennion felt that the [...] "genius" [...] of the episode was the way that tension was [...] "undercut" [...] with humour, but felt that the humour actually served to raise the tension. He highlighted the joke involving blue paint as particularly funny. Patrick Mulkern, of Radio Times, also praised the mix of humour and horror.|$|E
500|$|Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture {{wrote that}} [...] "the song veers toward Stefani's more mellifluous, sentimental fare," [...] {{calling it a}} [...] "heartrending track". Amanda Dykan of AltWire praised the track, stating: [...] " [...] reaches through, wraps its acrylic-nailed fingers around your {{pulsating}} heart, rips <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> chest, throws it on the floor, and stomps all over it." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media claimed that [...] "Stefani – now 20 years wiser – flips it"; she continued with: [...] "It’s a rare moment on the album where you can pick out Stefani from a sea of other pop singers." [...] Mapes concluded by claiming that [...] "Used to Love You" [...] was her greatest song since [...] "Don't Speak", comparing its effect to Madonna's 1989 single [...] "Like a Prayer". Sean Fitz-Gerald of Vulture warned that when listening to this [...] "heartending track" [...] that [...] "tissues are a must". Consequence of Sound critic Adam Kivel enjoyed the track, calling it a [...] "recognizable moment in heartbreak delivered in a charming falsetto burble". Nate Jackson from OC Weekly appreciated the [...] "somber" [...] of the track, while Marcus Floyd from Renowned for Sound awarded it 4.5 out of 5 stars, claiming that [...] "every lyric and every note are sung with heart and chorus just gets you". Michael Smith from the same website acknowledged [...] "Used to Love You" [...] {{as one of the}} strongest songs on This Is What the Truth Feels Like, calling it [...] "unexpectedly heartfelt".|$|E

[...] He replied, [...] "I love my family very, very much and will do anything for them.... The best thing I can say is kind of, 'Leave my family alone, just like I'll leave your family alone.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|When he was 14, the Spanish tennis {{federation}} {{requested that}} he leave Mallorca {{and move to}} Barcelona to continue his tennis training. Nadal's family turned down this request, partly because they feared it would hurt his education, but also because Toni said that [...] "I don't {{want to believe that}} {{you have to go to}} America, or other places to be a good athlete. You can do <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> home." [...] The decision to stay home meant that Nadal received less financial support from the federation; instead, Nadal's father covered the costs. In May 2001, he defeated former Grand Slam tournament champion Pat Cash in a clay-court exhibition match.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Bjelland {{moved from}} Portland to Minneapolis, where she formed Babes in Toyland. She met Lori Barbero at a {{barbecue}} {{not long after}} moving to Minneapolis in the mid-1980s, and convinced her to become a drummer– something that Lori became talented at. The pair joined with bassist Michelle Leon, and Babes in Toyland was formed. Bjelland has said she intentionally sought out bandmates who had no instrumental experience: [...] "Lori didn't {{know how to play}} when I met her. Michelle didn't know how to play. I was self-taught. Hopefully, from being technically inexperienced, you can use your imagination, and play the drums like an instrument instead of just being a beat-keeper. And play the bass like you feel <b>it,</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> gut, instead of saying, 'Here's my scales.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} is about the mental state of dealing with {{different}} stages of a failed relationship. Similarly to Not Without a Fight, which dealt with the divorces suffered by Gilbert and Pundik, Radiosurgery was inspired by one band member almost [...] "losing their mind." [...] due to a [...] "severe" [...] separation. It was later revealed {{that it was in}} fact bassist Ian Grushka's divorce in October 2010 that inspired the record. Grushka's nine-year marriage, including two children, reached a bitter conclusion with Grushka reflecting, [...] "It's crazy how quickly love can turn to hate. Basically, this last year, I've lost my mind completely. It takes time, it's been hard." [...] The bassist turned to Klein for support, often writing notes and calling his bandmate over the phone to discuss his feelings. The album's lyrics are directly about the different emotions Grushka went through after the divorce, including sadness, regret, and feeling on the verge of insanity. In an interview with NME magazine, the guitarist pointed out, [...] "If you're in a long-term relationship and it came to an end, you go through stages of regret, then you're sad, angry. Then you kind of lose your mind and want to go out with your friends, have a good time [...] get into trouble. Then you just want to forget this person. Our idea is that after going through all these stages, you can't get the past out of your head, so you could surgically remove <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>your</b> mind." [...] The single [...] "Radiosurgery" [...] was one of the final songs written for the album and was chosen as the title track in order [...] "to encompass the whole record, like the complete thought. Its concept is much like the film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, according to guitarist Steve Klein. The song also contains the lyric [...] "it makes my brain hurt", a direct homage to the Screeching Weasel song [...] "My Brain Hurts", while portraying a person suffering from auditory hallucination. Meanwhile, [...] "Anthem for the Unwanted" [...] is a song about [...] "the point in a relationship where you pretty much are getting kicked out. It's pretty much the beginning of the end." [...] While [...] "I'm Not the One" [...] is specifically themed around a one night stand, which Gilbert describes as [...] "going out and doing something that you know you shouldn't be doing – and still going through with it. Because, that's life. People make mistakes." ...|$|E
