50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> is the <b>right</b> to {{fly over}} a foreign country without landing. It grants the {{privilege}} {{to fly over}} the territory of a treaty country without landing. Member states of the International Air Services Transit Agreement grant this freedom (as well as the second freedom) to other member states, subject to the transiting aircraft using designated air routes. As of the summer of 2007, 129 countries were parties to this treaty, including such large ones as the United States of America, India, and Australia. However, Brazil, Russia, Indonesia, and China never joined, and Canada left the treaty in 1988. These large and strategically located non-IASTA-member states prefer to maintain tighter control over foreign airlines' overflight of their airspace, and negotiate transit agreements with other countries on a case-by-case basis. Since {{the end of the}} Cold War, <b>first</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> are almost completely universal. Most countries require prior notification before an overflight, and may charge substantial fees for the privilege.|$|R

FIRE stated that [...] "if simply offending others and causing an 'outpouring' of criticism and consternation were sufficient to overcome a faculty member's <b>First</b> Amendment <b>rights,</b> <b>freedom</b> of expression on campus would be reduced to a nullity." ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>first</b> {{and second}} <b>freedoms</b> grant <b>rights</b> {{to pass through}} a country without {{carrying}} traffic that originates or terminates there and are known as 'transit rights'. The Chicago Convention drew up a multilateral agreement in which the <b>first</b> two <b>freedoms,</b> known as the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA) or [...] "Two Freedoms Agreement", were open to all signatories. As of mid-2007, the treaty was accepted by 129 countries.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights,</b> {{the nature of the}} rights to human dignity, to life, and not to be discriminated against, or the right to a fair trial, does not permit them to be waived: “Unlike the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights,</b> these rights cannot be exercised negatively.” The <b>right</b> to <b>freedom</b> of expression, for example, can be exercised by keeping quiet, but the right to dignity cannot be exercised by being abused. One cannot therefore assume that the right is exercised when it is waived (as one can, subject to the above considerations, with the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights).</b>|$|R
50|$|Beyond rights {{allow the}} {{carriage}} of traffic between (and sometimes within) {{countries that are}} foreign to the airlines that operate them. Today, the most controversial of these are fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Less controversial but still restricted at times, though relatively more common are sixth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} degrees of {{accessibility}} to public records between states, with some making it {{fairly easy to}} request and receive documents, and others with many exemptions and restricted categories of documents. One state that is fairly responsive to public records requests is New York, which utilizes the Committee on Open Government to assist citizens with their requests. A state that is fairly restrictive in how they respond to public records requests is Pennsylvania, where the law currently presumes that all documents are exempt from disclosure, unless they can be proven otherwise. The California Public Records Act (California Government Code §§6250-6276.48) covers the arrest and booking records of inmates in the State of California jails and prisons, which {{are not covered by}} <b>First</b> Amendment <b>rights</b> (<b>freedom</b> of speech and of the press). Public access to arrest and booking records is seen as a critical safeguard of liberty.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{demonstrates}} that socioeconomic development, emancipative cultural change and democratization constitute a coherent syndrome of social progress – a syndrome whose common focus {{has not been}} properly specified by classical modernization theory. We specify this syndrome as ‘human development’, arguing that its three components have a common focus on broadening human choice. Socioeconomic development gives people the objective means of choice by increasing individual resources; rising emancipative values strengthen people’s subjective orientation towards choice; and democratization provides legal guarantees of choice by institutionalizing <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Analysis of data from the World Values Surveys {{demonstrates that}} the linkage between individual resources, emancipative values and <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> is universal in its presence across nations, regions and cultural zones; that this human development syndrome is shaped by a causal effect of individual resources and emancipative values on freedom rights; and that this effect operates through its impact on elite integrity, as the factor which makes <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> effective...|$|R
