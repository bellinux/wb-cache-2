5|$|The {{musical score}} was {{composed}} by Vishal–Shekhar, and the lyrics for the film's six songs {{were written by}} Vishal Dadlani, Anvita Dutt and Sandeep Srivastava. Several of R. D. Burman's Hindi and Bengali compositions {{were used in the}} background. An album of the music was released on 22 February 2012 and subsequently on the <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> platform Apple iTunes India since its inception from mid-2012.|$|E
5|$|The {{music has}} been {{compared}} to the tone of alternative rock bands Radiohead, TheFlamingLips, and R.E.M.'s 1998 album Up. Furthermore, Barry Walters of Spin has compared the music to former Eno collaborators U2 and several reviewers have compared the musicality to PaulSimon—especially his 2006 Eno collaboration Surprise. The vocals have been declared similar to NeilYoung; and the arrangement {{has been compared to}} TheBeachBoys. Although the music was informed by gospel and <b>digital</b> <b>music,</b> comparisons have been made with genres as diverse as country due to the vocal delivery and oldschoolhiphop. One weakness addressed by several reviewers is the unoriginality of the music, especially in comparison to the duo's previous collaborations.|$|E

5|$|In {{a dispute}} {{illustrating}} {{the nature of}} claims, defenses, and counterclaims for patent infringement based on arguments of prior art and first to file, rival <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> player maker Creative Technology sued Apple in May 2006 for Apple's alleged infringement of Creative's Zen patent claiming Apple infringed Creative's patent for the menuing structures on an MP3 player. Creative claimed it began using its menuing method on its Nomad players in September 2000, approximately a year prior to Apple's first iPod release in October 2001. Creative, a Singapore-based consumer electronics group, also filed a trade complaint with the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) against Apple. Creative asked for a court injunction to block the import and sale of Apple's iPod and iPod nano in the United States and for money damages for past sales. Apple filed a countersuit against Creative on similar grounds.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead {{ruled out}} an internet-only {{distribution}} {{for fear that}} some fans would not have internet access. In Rainbows was released on CD and vinyl in Japan by BMG on 26 December 2007, in Australia on 29 December 2007 by Remote Control Records, and in the United States and Canada on 1 January 2008 by ATO imprint TBD Records and MapleMusic/Fontana respectively. Elsewhere, the album was released on 31 December 2007 by independent record label XL Recordings. The CD release came in a cardboard package containing the CD, lyric booklet, and several stickers that could {{be placed on the}} blank jewel case to create cover art. In Rainbows was the first Radiohead album available for download in several <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> stores, such as the iTunes Store and Amazon MP3. On 10 June 2016, it was added to the free streaming service Spotify.|$|E
25|$|The macOS {{version of}} iTunes can also {{synchronize}} {{with a small}} number of discontinued <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> players, while the Windows version supports only the iPod. The synchronization is limited, however, in that the iPod is the only <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> player compatible with Apple's proprietary FairPlay digital rights management technology, and thus most music purchased through the iTunes Store (before the introduction of iTunes Plus) can only be played on an iPod. The remaining ability to synchronize with a limited number of legacy <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> players is likely a remnant of Apple's history in the music industry: iTunes was released in January 2001, nine months prior to the iPod's unveiling, and slightly more than two years before the introduction of the iTunes Music Store. When iTunes was released, compatibility with other music players was critical. Since iPod has now become the dominant <b>digital</b> <b>music</b> player, Apple no longer considers that compatibility to be a necessity.|$|E
