25|$|As {{noted in}} the {{preceding}} section, between 1990–1999, {{there was a large}} reduction in the emissions of the EITs. The reduction in the EITs is largely responsible for the total (aggregate) reduction (excluding LULUCF) <b>in</b> <b>emissions</b> of the Annex I countries, excluding the US. Emissions of the Annex II countries (Annex I minus the EIT countries) have experienced a limited increase <b>in</b> <b>emissions</b> from 1990–2006, followed by stabilization and a more marked decrease from 2007 onwards.

25|$|A study {{performed}} by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI) in 1997 sought to discover whether the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from increased natural gas (predominantly methane) use would be offset by a possible increased level of methane emissions from sources such as leaks and emissions. The study concluded that the reduction <b>in</b> <b>emissions</b> from increased natural gas use outweighs the detrimental effects of increased methane emissions. More recent peer-reviewed studies have challenged {{the findings of this}} study, with researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reconfirming findings of high rates of methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas fields.|$|E
