40|$|<b>Dibutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> is (<b>DBP)</b> the top {{priority}} toxicant responsible for carcinogenicity, teratogenicity and endocrine disruption. This study demonstrates the DBP degradation capability of the two newly isolated bacteria from municipal solid waste leachate samples. The isolated bacteria were designated as Pseudomonas sp. V 21 b and Comamonas sp. 51 F after scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Gram-staining, antibiotic sensitivity tests, biochemical characterization, 16 S-rRNA gene identification and phylogenetic studies. They were able to grow on <b>DBP,</b> benzyl butyl <b>phthalate,</b> monobutyl phthalate, diisodecyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, and protocatechuate. It was observed that Pseudomonas sp. V 21 b was more efficient in DBP degradation when compared with Comamonas sp. 51 F. It degraded 57 % and 76 % of the initial DBP in minimal salt medium and in DBP contaminated samples respectively. Kinetics {{for the effects of}} DBP concentration on Pseudomonas sp. V 21 b and Comamonas sp. 51 F growth was also evaluated. Stoichiometry for DBP degradation and biomass formation were compared for both the isolates. Two major metabolites diethyl phthalate and monobutyl phthalates were identified using GC–MS in the extracts. Key genes were amplified from the genomes of Pseudomonas sp.

50|$|Polymer clay {{safety is}} the subject of concern {{specifically}} regarding the long-term effects of exposure to certain phthalate plasticizers that have been classified as endocrine disruptors. It should not contain more than 0.1% of any of the six phthalates restricted or banned by the safety regulatory boards. These six phthalates are: DEHP (Di-2-ethylhexyl <b>phthalate),</b> <b>DBP</b> (<b>Dibutyl</b> <b>phthalate),</b> BBP (Benzyl butyl phthalate), DINP (Di-isononyl phthalate), DIDP (Di-isodecyl phthalate), and DnOP (Di-n-octyl phthalate.If the instructions on the package are followed (i.e. low temperatures and brief baking times) one will not burn the clay. If the clay does burn because of a mistake or if the oven malfunctions, a small amount of hydrogen chloride gas could be released, which may cause odor and some eye or nose irritation. The amount of hydrogen chloride gas released from the clay could cause a health problem.|$|R
5000|$|In February 2009, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act imposed {{regulations}} of several substances and banned the manufacture for sale, distribution in commerce, or import any children's toy or childcare article that contains [...] "concentrations {{of more than}} 0.1 percent of" [...] di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), <b>dibutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DBP),</b> or benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP). Michael Kamrin, who was on ACSH's Board of Scientific and Policy Advisors, published a critical review in 2009 in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, saying that phthalates were safe. ACSH's advocacy on the issue extends back to 1999, when it worked with former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to advocate for the ingredient used in many soft plastics.|$|E
50|$|Fragrance {{chemicals}} {{are found in}} most cleaning products, perfumes, and personal care products. More than 3000 {{chemicals are}} used in these fragrance mixtures. The synthetic musks used in detergents accumulate in the environment and are harmful to aquatic organisms. Certain musks are possible endocrine disruptors that interfere with hormone functioning. Phthalates are a common ingredient in these fragrance mixtures found in laundry detergents and fabric softeners. These phthalates are suspected endocrine disrupters that affect reproduction rates including reduced sperm count in males. Certain glass cleaners and floor polishes contain <b>dibutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DBP).</b> The European Union classifies DBP as very toxic to aquatic organisms, posing a huge danger as these cleaners, especially the floor polishes are often rinsed down the drain and into aquatic environments.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dibutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DBP)</b> {{is used in}} some nail enamels and hardeners. DBP is a {{plasticizer}} that is {{used because}} of its flexibility and film forming properties, making it an ideal ingredient in nail polishes. When a polish is applied, it dries to the nail {{as some of the}} other chemicals volatilize. DBP is a chemical that remains on the nail, making the polish less brittle and apt to crack. The chemical may not only be absorbed through the nail, but through the skin as well. When nail-polished hands are washed, small amounts of DBP can leach out of the polish and come into contact with the skin. The application of nail polish can also provide an opportunity for skin absorption.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{run up to}} {{the trial}} of those accused, the court ordered that fresh tests be carried out on the samples {{recovered}} from the trains and on remains of explosive recovered from different sites connected to the bombings. These tests were carried out by specialists appointed from the security services, the defence and other parties to the accusation. The judges ordered that video and audio recordings be made of these tests. The results of these testswere also inconclusive concerning the samples taken from the explosion sites. Nitroglycerine was detected {{in one of these}} samples, and the presence of dinitrotoluene (DNT) was also detected. This has led to claims that the explosive used could have been Titadine. However, also detected in the same sample was <b>dibutyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (<b>DBP),</b> which is a component of Goma 2 ECO but not of titadine. [...] Several other samples from the explosion sites also revealed the joint presence of DNT and DBP. Tests were carried out on a sample of Titadine.
