Simulations with the Isotope-incorporated Global Spectral Model (IsoGSM) revealed an amplifying influence of post-condensation exchanges (i. e., raindrop evaporation and vapor equilibration) on interannual δ 18 Op variations throughout the western U. <b>S.</b> <b>Mid-latitude</b> and subtropical vapor tagging simulations showed that the influence of moisture advection on δ 18 Op was relatively strong in the Pacific Northwest, but weak over the rest of the western U.

However, vertical-tagging simulations revealed a strong influence of condensation height on δ 18 Op in California. In the interior of the western U. S., a strong temperature effect was found only after annual mean temperatures were weighted by monthly precipitation totals. These multiple influences on δ 18 Op complicate interpretations of western U. S. climate proxies that are derived from isotopes in precipitation...|$|R

40|$|Volume {{mixing ratio}} water vapour {{profiles}} have been retrieved from IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) spectra {{by using the}} MUSICA (MUlti-platform remote Sensing of Isotopologues for investigating the Cycle of Atmospheric water) processor. The retrievals are made for IASI observations that coincide with Vaisala RS 92 radiosonde measurements performed {{in the framework of}} the GCOS (Global Climate Observing System) Reference Upper-Air Network (GRUAN) in three different climate zones: the tropics (Manus Island, 2 ° <b>S),</b> <b>mid-latitudes</b> (Lindenberg, 52 ° N) and polar regions (Sodankylä, 67 ° N). The retrievals show good sensitivity with respect to the vertical H 2 O distribution between 1 – 2  km above ground and the upper troposphere. Typical DOFS (degree of freedom for signal) values are about 5. 5 for the tropics, 5. 0 for summertime midlatitudes, 4. 0 for wintertime mid-latitudes, and 4. 5 for summertime polar regions. The errors of the IASI water vapour profiles have been theoretically estimated considering the contribution {{of a large number of}} uncertainty sources. For all three climate regions unrecognized cirrus clouds and uncertainties in atmospheric temperature have been identified as the most important error sources, whereby the total errors are estimated to be typically 25  %. The IASI water vapour profiles have been compared to 100 individual coinciding GRUAN water vapour profiles. The systematic difference between the IASI and GRUAN data is within 12  % at all altitudes. The scatter is largest close to the surface and close to the tropopause, but does never exceed 30  %. The study documents that the MUSICA MetOp/IASI retrieval processor provides H 2 O profiles with good accuracy and captures the variations in H 2 O volume mixing ratio profiles from 1 – 2  km above ground up to altitudes close to the tropopause with a precision that is in accordance to the theoretical error assessment...|$|R

40|$|Within a {{particular}} induction region the geomagnetic response function possesses a {{dependence on the}} wavenumber of the inducing field. To investigate possible relationships between response function and wave­ number, the local time dependence of the magnetic variation fields {{used to determine the}} response function can be retained. Such an analysis has been carried out at five UK sites using single-station transfer function analysis in the period range from 2000 to 40 s. To allow a level of significance to be established the local time estimates are compared with the time-averaged determinations. At periods greater than 500 s there is no significant local time variation of the transfer function estimates. At periods less than 500 <b>s,</b> corresponding to <b>mid-latitude</b> pulsation fields, significant local time variations are observed. At four of the five sites studied, the diurnal character in the transfer function estimate consists of a maximum response on the dayside and a corresponding nightside minimum.

This article is an exposition of four loosely related remarks on the geometry of Finsler manifolds with constant positive flag curvature.

40|$|A spacelike surface S⊂S^ 4 _ 1 is {{marginally}} trapped if its {{mean curvature}} vector is lightlike.

We show that these invariants plus an additional quadratic differential δ are related by a differential equation and determine the geometry of S up to ambient isometries of S^ 4 _ 1.

40|$|The Earth 2 ̆ 7 s {{atmosphere}} is typically characterized by its temperature structure, which naturally divides the atmosphere into several discrete regions. They {{are in order}} of increasing altitude the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. The first layer and {{a large portion of}} the second layer of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s atmosphere are routinely measured via weather balloons that are launched twice daily around the globe. Satellites and their development have motivated the study of the thermosphere. It is the middle region of the Earth atmosphere, which is mainly composed of the mesosphere that lacks routine in situ measurements. Routine observations are therefore carried out via remote sensing. Ground-based instruments typically provide high resolution measurements of the atmosphere over a single point on the globe and space-based instrument capture a global picture at lower resolution. A Rayleigh-scatter lidar has been in operation at Utah State University (41. 7 °N III. 8 °N) starting in September 1993. Observations have continued from that point until the present when funding and observing conditions have permitted. Under normal observational conditions the backscattered photons are proportional to the atmospheric density. These relative density profiles can be used to derive absolute temperature profiles over much of the middle atmosphere. The resulting II years of temperature profiles have been combined into a single composite year which contains - 900 nights and - 5000 hours of observations.

40|$|As will be {{described}} elsewhere in this conference by Mercereau, when a superconducting film ring of appropriate geometry {{is placed in}} a time varying magnetic field, {{there will be a}} quantized Faraday induction signal in the ring which will be periodic in the applied flux with a period ϕ 0 = h/ 2 e = 2. 07 × 10 - 7 gauss. cm 2. Experimentally the induced emf is detected by inductively coupling the ring to a tank circuit resonant at radio frequencies (1 - 30 MHz) which has a Q factor of 200 to 1, 000. At a pump frequency of 30 MHz, for optimum coupling of the ring device to the tank circuit, the amplitude of the detected voltage across the tank circuit is of the order of 10 to 50 microvolts. The periodic behavior of this detected voltage with applied magnetic flux has been used to make a number of very sensitive and accurate magnetometers. For the measurement of very small magnetic fluxes (Δϕ ≲ ϕ 0), the tank circuit containing the ring device is connected to a feedback or mulling circuit. A small amplitude modulation field at frequency ωmod (ωmod ϕ 0) can be accomplished by making use of the periodic response of the devices to ambient fields. A small amplitude modulation field at frequency ωmod is again applied to the device and the detected signals across the tank circuit to which the device is coupled at the fundamental frequency ωmod and the harmonic frequency 2 ωmod are detected and processed by suitable logic circuits to produce an output which indicates digitally the change in the magnetic flux in units of ϕ 0 / 4 as well as the sign of the field change. The maximum counting rate of such a circuit is limited by the maximum modulation frequency that can be used which must satisfy the 2 ωmod ≲ ω pump/Q/ 2. For a 30 MHz and Q = 300 the maximum counting rate achieved was about 104 per s. For a 1 mm diameter device, this circuit can track magnetic field changes as fast as 0. 06 <b>gauss</b> per <b>s</b> digitally in units of 6 × 10 - 6 gauss. Much higher counting rate should be achieved by increasing the pump frequency to microwave frequencies. For example, for 1010 Hz, and Q = 1, 000, modulation frequencies as high as 107 Hz can be used and thus, counting rates approaching this value should be realized assuming an adequate signal to noise ratio for this bandwidth can be obtained. Although these devices are intrinsically sensitive to changes in the ambient magnetic flux, it is possible to modify either of the above configurations to determine absolute flux. If the device can be rotated exactly 180 ° about an axis normal to the axis of the cylinder on which the film ring is deposited, the absolute value of the magnetic field is obtained by appropriate averaging of the output readings of the circuits for the 0 and 180 ° orientations of the device...|$|R
40|$|The Montreal Protocol is working. Concentrations {{of major}} ozone-depleting {{substances}} {{in the atmosphere}} are now decreasing, and the decline in total column amounts seen in the 1980 s and 1990 <b>s</b> at <b>mid-latitudes</b> has not continued. In polar regions, there is much greater natural variability. Each spring, large ozone holes continue to occur in Antarctica and less severe regions of depleted ozone continue {{to occur in the}} Arctic. There is evidence that some of these changes are driven by changes in atmospheric circulation rather than being solely attributable to reductions in ozone-depleting substances, which may indicate a linkage to climate change. Global ozone is still lower than in the 1970 s and a return to that state is not expected for several decades. As changes in ozone impinge directly on UV radiation, elevated UV radiation due to reduced ozone is expected to continue over that period. Long-term changes in UV-B due to ozone depletion are difﬁcult to verify through direct measurement, but there is strong evidence that UV-B irradiance increased over the period of ozone depletion. At unpolluted sites in the southern hemisphere, {{there is some evidence that}} UV-B irradiance has diminished since the late 1990 s. The availability and temporal extent of UV data have improved, and we are now able to evaluate the changes in recent times compared with those estimated since the late 1920 s, when ozone measurements ﬁrst became available. The increases in UV-B irradiance over the latter part of the 20 th century have been larger than the natural variability. There is increased evidence that aerosols have a larger effect on surface UV-B radiation than previously thought. At some sites in the Northern Hemisphere, UV-B irradiance may continue to increase because of continuing reductions in aerosol extinctions since the 1990 s. Interactions between ozone depletion and climate change are complex and can be mediated through changes in chemistry, radiation, and atmospheric circulation patterns. The changes can be in both directions: ozone changes can affect climate, and climate change can affect ozone. The observational evidence suggests that stratospheric ozone (and therefore UV-B) has responded relatively quickly to changes in ozone-depleting substances, implying that climate interactions have not delayed this process. Model calculations predict that at mid-latitudes a return of ozone to pre- 1980 levels is expected by the mid 21 st century. However, it may take a decade or two longer in polar regions. Climate change can also affect UV radiation through changes in cloudiness and albedo, without involving ozone and since temperature changes over the 21 st century are likely to be about 5 times greater than in the past century. This is likely to have signiﬁcant effects on future cloud, aerosol and surface reﬂectivity. Consequently, unless strong mitigation measures are undertaken with respect to climate change, profound effects on the biosphere and on the solar UV radiation received at the Earth’s surface can be anticipated. The future remains uncertain. Ozone is expected to increase slowly over the decades ahead, but it is not known whether ozone will return to higher levels, or lower levels, than those present prior to the onset of ozone depletion in the 1970 s. There is even greater uncertainty about future UV radiation, since it will be additionally inﬂuenced by changes in aerosols and clouds...|$|R
40|$|By surface we mean (if the {{contrary}} is not stipulated) a two dimensional Riemannian manifold. It {{is well known}} that a coordinate system on a surface is called Chebyshev if the first fundamental form of the surface has the form ds 2 = du 2 + 2 cosθ(u, v) dudv + dv 2. In the other words, all coordinate lines are parameterized by arc length and θ(u, v) is the angle between coordinate lines. The Hazzidakis formula (see, for instance [H], Lemma 2. 3 of section??) shows that Chebyshev coordinates may not exist on a complete simply connected surface with | ∫ ∫ KdS |> 2 π. Here K is <b>Gauss</b> curvature and <b>S</b> is surface area. Our purpose is to find necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of Chebyshev coordinates. We consider not only Riemannian manifolds but also more general Alexandrov surfaces (which are called “ 2 -dimensional manifolds of bounded curvature ” as well). This class includes 2 -manifolds equipped with Riemannian or polyhedral metrics and their uniform limits under condition that integral curvatures are uniformly bounded and limit does not destroy topology; see details in [AZ] or [Resh]. P. L. Chebyshev proved local existence of his coordinates (he did that under traditional for that time analyticity assumption). The first nonlocal result belongs to I. Bakelman. He proved existence of Chebyshev coordinates in any sector bounded by two orthogonal geodesics on an Alexandrov surface under condition that positive and negative integral curvatures both are less than π 2. It is easily to see that for sector, this result can not be improved. Much later, a similar result but only for C ∞-smooth Riemannian manifolds was proved by S. L. Samelson and W. P. Dayawansa [SD]: under the same curvature restriction, they proved existence of a global Chebyshev net on every complete simply connected C ∞-smooth surface. Their proof is basically analytical. It is known that the existence problem of Chebyshev coordinates can be reduced to the problem of existence of a solution for some hyperbolic PDE system of the second order. In [SD], this system is solved by the method of the paper [LSh]. Remark. Formally, the I. Bakelman theorem does not imply the result of [SD] because in the case of smooth surfaces, Chebyshev coordinates he got ar...|$|R
