40|$|To {{assess the}} {{antihypertensive}} effects of <b>fenquizone</b> {{as compared with}} chlorthalidone, twenty out-patients with mild to moderate hypertension were treated, with the two study drugs, in a randomized, double blind, cross-over trial. All patients were given a complete chemical and biological examination before inclusion in the study. Both drugs significantly lowered diastolic blood pressure both in supine and standing position. However, {{a comparison of the}} effects of the two diuretics on systolic blood pressure was precluded by a persisting drugs’ activity long after the first course of the therapy was completed, and by an inadeguate matching of blood pressure levels in the groups studied. With both drugs, we observed an increase in heart rate in the standing position only. Both diuretics showed no side effects or determined alterations in the patients’ laboratory values. <b>Fenquizone</b> as chlorthalidone provides effective control of mild to moderate hypertension while being free of major side effects...|$|E
