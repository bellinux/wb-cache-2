40|$|The {{functional}} properties and enzymatic digestibility of cationic and cross-linked cationic ae, wx, and normal maize starches were studied. Cationization reduced the <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> temperatures (T(o), T(p), and T(c)), however, it increased peak viscosity, swelling power, solubility, clarity, and digestibility {{of all the}} starches compared to the corresponding native starch. After cationization, the enthalpy of waxy and normal starches was little changed but ae starch showed a decrease. For gel texture, cationization increased the hardness, adhesiveness, and springiness of all the starches, except for the hardness and adhesiveness of normal starch which showed a decrease, and the springiness of waxy starch did not show much change compared to the corresponding control starch. Cross-linking of cationic starch increased the <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> temperatures, as well as peak viscosity.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is the elucidation of two <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> at 74 and 90 degreesC, respectively, {{observed}} during differential scanning calorimetry of glassy itraconazole. Modulated temperature DSC (MTDSC), hot-stage microscopy (HSM), HPLC and high temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-X ray) were used to examine the thermal properties of glassy itraconazole. It was found that the preparation mode of the glass does not seem to influence the appearance of both <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> since they were present during heating of glassy itraconazole which was prepared by cooling the melt or by rapid solvent evaporation of an itraconazole solution. These observations suggest that the appearance of the two <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> require the liquid state prior to glass formation. The transitions are not due to impurities in the starting material, nor are they caused by thermal decomposition. This was further confirmed by HPLC-analysis. HSM showed structure formation following cooling of the melt, at approximately 87 degreesC; cooling the product further showed a second change in optical contrast. HT-X ray confirmed and identified the formation of a nematic mesophase. The appearance of the two endothermic signals during scanning of glassy itraconazole points to the formation of a mesophase. Due to the nature of itraconazole, it appears as a chiral nematic phase of which the mobility is frozen into a glass upon cooling below 59 degreesC thereby impeding further crystallization. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs) have drawn {{considerable}} interest {{from both the}} scientific community and the industry due to: a) a high energy conversion efficiency; b) a low environmental impact; and c) the possibility of applications ranging from portable electronics to the automotive sector. The heart of a PEMFC is its proton exchange membrane (PEM). The most widely used PEMs consist of perfluorinated polymer electrolytes such as Nafion. These systems have drawbacks such as their low proton conductivity at temperatures higher than 90 °C and at low relative humidity which severely limits their large-scale commerciol use. In order to overcome these limitations, PEMs composed of perfluorinated ionomers doped with proton-conducting ionic liquids (PCILs) were recently proposed due to their high conductivity under anhydrous conditions, large electrochemical stability window and good thermal stability. Here, we report the investigation of triethylammonium-methanesulfonate (MST) and triethylammonium-perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBuT) PCILs by techniques such as Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Broadband Electric Spectroscopy (BES). These measurements allow us to investigate {{the relationship between the}} thermal behaviour and the proton conduction mechanism of this type of ionic liquid. The TGA/DSC results indicated that: a) ILs are thermally stable up to 200 °C; b) MST shows a glass transition at - 17 °C and two <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> at 20 and 38 °C; and c) PFBuT shows a glass transition at - 20 °C and two <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> at 17 and 61 °C.

Over the temperature range 0 – 90 °C, fully hydrated C 16 : 0 -LacCer shows complex thermal transitions characteristic of polymorphic behavior of exclusively bilayer phases. On heating at 5 °C/min, hydrated C 16 : 0 -LacCer undergoes a complex two-peak <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> with maxima at 69 °C and 74 °C and a total enthalpy of 14. 6 kcal/mol C 16 : 0 -LacCer. At a slower heating rate (1. 5 °C/min), two endothermic transitions are observed at 66 °C and 78 °C. After cooling to 0 °C, the subsequent heating run shows three overlapping endothermic transitions at 66 °C, 69 °C, and 71. 5 °C, followed by a chain-melting <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> at 78 °C. Two thermal protocols were used to completely convert C 16 : 0 -LacCer to its stable, high melting temperature (78 °C) form. As revealed by x-ray diffraction, over the temperature range 20 – 78 °C this stable phase exhibits a bilayer structure, periodicity d ≈ 65 Å with an ordered chain packing mode. At the phase transition (78 °C) chain melting occurs, and C 16 : 0 -LacCer converts to a liquid crystalline bilayer (Lα) phase of reduced periodicity d ≈ 59 Å.

DSC of hydrated (70 wt% water) NSGS shows an <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> at 85 degrees C (delta H = 18. 0 kcal/mol NSGS) and a broad exothermic transition at 40 - 60 degrees C, the latter being dependent upon the previous cooling rate. X-Ray diffraction patterns recorded at 21, 61, and 86 degrees C provide evidence for interconversions between metastable and stable crystalline NSGS bilayer phases. The properties of the unsaturated-chain cerebrosides are more complex. Hydrated NOGS shows a single <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> at 44. 8 degrees C (delta H = 11. 5 kcal/mol NOGS). However, incubation of NOGS at 49 degrees C for 24 h results in a second transition at 55. 5 degrees C. By cycling NOGS between 0 and 49 degrees C complete conversion into this higher melting phase (delta H = 12. 1 kcal/mol NOGS) is achieved. X-ray diffraction confirms a bilayer phase at all temperatures and delineates the conversions between a crystalline phase at 21 degrees C (bilayer period d = 56. 5 A), a second crystalline phase at 47 degrees C (d = 69. 9 A), and a liquid crystalline phase at 59 degrees C (d = 52. 0 A). The more unsaturated NLnGS shows two transitions, a sharp transition at 28 degrees C (delta H = 8. 0 kcal/mol NLGS) and a broad, low-enthalpy transition at 42 degrees C (delta H = 0. 4 kcal/mol NLGS). Again, incubation between the two transitions leads to a single transition at 44 degrees C (delta H = 9. 3 kcal/mol NLGS). X-ray diffraction demonstrates conversions between two crystalline bilayer phases (d = 55. 2 A and d = 68. 4 A), and a liquid crystalline bilayer phase (d = 51. 8 A).

The calorimetric transition correlates with the temperature dependent increase of viscosity and static light scattering as well as with changes observed by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The SANS results provide clear evidence for a distinct structural change occurring at the transition temperature, which is interpreted as a sphere-to-rod transition of the detergent micelles.

40|$|The thermal {{behaviors}} of cetyl (C 16 OH) and stearyl (C 18 OH) alcohols, {{alone or in}} mixture (C 16 / 18 OH), or flooded with water in the absence or presence of cetyl trimetyl ammonium chloride (CTAC), have been investigated using differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray scattering. Additional endothermic temperature transitions were observed at 16. 9, 58. 8, and 70. 7 A degrees C and also an unusual exothermic transition at 63. 5 A degrees C, when C 16 / 18 OH is {{in the presence of}} CTAC. The two first transitions at 16. 9 and 58. 8 A degrees C seems to be, respectively, linked to the hydration mechanism and the melting of long-chain alcohols, while the exothermic one at 63. 5 A degrees C is corresponding to the crystallization of a swollen lamellar phase L (beta). The crystallized swollen lamellar phase L (beta) melts at 70. 7 A degrees C into a L (alpha) swollen liquid lamellar mesomorph phase, inducing an <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition.</b> This L (beta) -> L (alpha) transition is reversible upon cooling and reheating. Those data are key information to control the dispersion state of swollen lamellar crystals of long-chain alcohols...|$|E
40|$|The 7 S/ 11 S {{glycinin}} equilibrium {{as found}} in Lakemond et al. (J. Agric. Food Chem. 2000, 48, xxxx-xxxx) at ambient temperatures influences heat denaturation. It is found that the 7 S form of glycinin denatures at a lower temperature than the 11 S form, as demonstrated {{by a combination of}} calorimetric (DSC) and circular dichroism (CD) experiments. At pH 7. 6, at which glycinin is mainly present in the 11 S form, the disulfide bridge linking the acidic and the basic polypeptides is broken during heat denaturation. At pH 3. 8, at which glycinin has dissociated partly into the 7 S form, and at pH 5. 2 this disruption does not take place, as demonstrated by solubility and gel electrophoretic experiments. A larger exposure of the acidic polypeptides (Lakemond et al., 2000) possibly correlates with a higher <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> temperature and with the appearance of an exothermic transition as observed with DSC. Denaturation/aggregation (studied by DSC) and changes in secondary structure (studied by far-UV CD) take place simultaneously. Generally, changes in tertiary structure (studied by near-UV CD) occur at lower temperatures than changes in secondary structure...|$|E
40|$|Rhodopsin is a kinetically stable protein constituting > 90 % of rod outer segment disk {{membrane}} protein. To {{investigate the}} bilayer contribution to rhodopsin kinetic stability, disk membranes were systematically disrupted by octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside. Rhodopsin kinetic stability was examined under subsolubilizing (rhodopsin in a bilayer environment perturbed by octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) and under fully solubilizing conditions (rhodopsin in a micelle with cosolubilized phospholipids). As determined by DSC, rhodopsin exhibited a scan-rate-dependent irreversible <b>endothermic</b> <b>transition</b> at {{all stages of}} solubilization. The transition temperature (Tm) decreased in the subsolubilizing stage. However, once the rhodopsin was in a micelle environment there was little change of the Tm as the phospholipid/rhodopsin ratio in the mixed micelles decreased during the fully solubilized stage. Rhodopsin thermal denaturation {{is consistent with the}} two-state irreversible model at all stages of solubilization. The activation energy of denaturation (Eact) was calculated from the scan rate dependence of the Tm and from the rate of rhodopsin thermal bleaching at all stages of solubilization. The Eact as determined by both techniques decreased in the subsolubilizing stage, but remained constant once fully solubilized. These results indicate the bilayer structure increases the Eact to rhodopsin denaturation...|$|E
40|$|Muscles and {{different}} proteins obtained from scallops (Chlamys tehuelchus and Zygochlamys patagonica) were analyzed. In both species of scallop, the thermograms of striated and smooth muscles showed two <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions.</b> The T max values corresponding to striated and smooth muscles from C. tehuelchus were 53. 2, 79. 0 °C and 52. 7, 78. 0 °C, respectively. The T max corresponding to striated and smooth muscles of Z. patagonica were 55. 0, 79. 2 °C and 54. 7, 78. 7 °C, respectively. No {{significant differences were}} observed between the thermal transitions of myofibrils and actomyosin of both types of muscles from both species of scallop. Irrespective of the species, the thermal stability decreased when the pH of the muscles was increased. The increase in ionic strength greatly affected T max, the ΔH total and the ΔH of the first transition. A significant decrease in ΔH total and ΔH corresponding to both transitions was observed, particularly in the striated muscles of Zygochlamys patagonica. These results indicate a major sensitivity of the adductor muscles of Zygochlamys {{to changes in the}} chemical environment...|$|R
40|$|There is circumstantial {{evidence}} that protein denaturation occurs in cells during heat shock at hyperthermic temperatures and that denatured or damaged protein {{is the primary}} inducer of the heat shock response. However, {{there is no direct}} evidence regarding the extent of denaturation of normal cellular proteins during heat shock. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is the most direct method of monitoring protein denaturation or unfolding. Due to the fundamental parameter measured, heat flow, DSC can be used to detect and quantitate <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> in complex structures such as isolated organelles and even intact cells. DSC profiles with common features are obtained for isolated rat hepatocytes, liver homogenate, and Chinese hamster lung V 79 fibroblasts. Five main transitions (A-E), several of which are resolvable into subcomponents, are observed with transition temperatures (Tm) of 45 - 98 degrees C. The onset temperature is approximately 40 degrees C, but some transitions may extend as low as 37 - 38 degrees C. In addition to acting as the primary signal for heat shock protein synthesis, the inactivation of critical proteins may lead to cell death. Critical target analysis implies that the rate limiting step of cell killing for V 79 cells is the inactivation of a protein with Tm = 46 degrees C within the A transition. Isolated microsomal membranes, mitochondria, nuclei, and a cytosolic fraction from rat liver have distinct DSC profiles that contribute to different peaks in the profile for intact hepatocytes. Thus, the DSC profiles for intact cells appears to be the sum of the profiles of all subcellular organelles and components. The presence of <b>endothermic</b> <b>transitions</b> in the isolated organelles is strong evidence that they are due to protein denaturation. Each isolated organelle has an onset for denaturation near 40 degrees C and contains thermolabile proteins denaturing at the predicted Tm (46 degrees C) for the critical target. The extent of denaturation at any temperature can be approximately by the fractional calorimetric enthalpy. After scanning to 45 degrees C at 1 degree C/min and immediately cooling, a relatively mild heat shock, an estimated fraction denaturation of 4 - 7 % is found in hepatocytes, V 79 cells, and the isolated organelles other than nuclei, which undergo only 1 % denaturation because of the high thermostability of chromatin. Thus, thermolabile proteins appear to be present in all cellular organelles and components, and protein denaturation is widespread and extensive after even mild heat shock...|$|R
