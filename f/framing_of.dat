5|$|Goffman was the 73rd {{president}} of the American Sociological Association. His best-known contribution to social theory is his study of symbolic interaction. This {{took the form of}} dramaturgical analysis, beginning with his 1956 book, The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life. Goffman's other major works include Asylums (1961), Stigma (1963), Interaction Ritual (1967), Frame Analysis (1974), and Forms of Talk (1981). His major areas of study included the sociology of everyday life, social interaction, the social construction of self, social organization (<b>framing)</b> <b>of</b> experience, and particular elements of social life such as total institutions and stigmas.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, William Baziotes, David Hare, Robert Motherwell and Mark Rothko {{founded the}} Subjects of the Artist School, which held artists' discussions in a loft at 35 East Eighth Street, Manhattan {{which came to}} be known as Studio 35. A closed panel {{symposium}} took place from April 21 to 23, 1950. It was organised by Robert Goodnough and moderated by Richard Lippold, Robert Motherwell and Alfred H. Barr, Jr. director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). The purpose was the <b>framing</b> <b>of</b> an art movement.|$|E

Because of his work on the State Building act, Laybourne Smith sat on the Board of Referees responsible for adjudicating disputes, and his position on the Architects Board of South Australia was a direct result of his involvement {{in the creation of the}} Architects Act.|$|E

5|$|Kiarostami's {{style is}} notable {{for the use}} of long shots, such as in the closing {{sequences}} of Life, and Nothing More... and Through the Olive Trees, where the audience is intentionally distanced physically from the characters to invite reflection on their fate. Taste of Cherry is punctuated throughout by shots of this kind, including distant overhead shots of the suicidal Badii's car moving across the hills, usually while he is in conversation with a passenger. The physical distancing techniques stand in juxtaposition to the dialogue, which always remains in the foreground. Like the coexistence of private and public space, or the frequent <b>framing</b> <b>of</b> landscapes through car windows, this fusion of distance with proximity has been seen as a way of generating suspense in the most mundane of moments.|$|E
5|$|The British comedy film Monty Python and the Holy Grail — {{a parody}} of the legends of King Arthur by the Monty Python team — was filmed on {{location}} in Scotland in 1974. The film's producers had gained permission from the National Trust for Scotland to film scenes at several of their Scottish castles, {{as well as the}} permission of Lord Moray to film at Doune Castle. However, the National Trust later withdrew their permission, leaving the producers with little time to find new locations. Instead, they decided to use different parts of Doune Castle to depict the various fictional castles in the film, relying on tight <b>framing</b> <b>of</b> shots to maintain the illusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{adoption}} {{of an official}} language for the Indian Republic was a hotly debated issue during the <b>framing</b> <b>of</b> the Indian Constitution after India's independence from the United Kingdom. After an exhaustive and divisive debate, Hindi was adopted as the official language of India with English continuing as an associate official language {{for a period of}} fifteen years, after which Hindi would become the sole official language. The new Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950. Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi the sole official language after 1965 were not acceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, who wanted the continued use of English. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi. To allay their fears, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru enacted the Official Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did not satisfy the DMK and increased their skepticism that his assurances might not be honoured by future administrations.|$|E
5|$|On October 12, 1957, {{during the}} peak of the Cold War, a number of parishes of the Armenian Apostolic Church in America, which were unaffiliated since 1933, came {{together}} under the Holy See of Cilicia with the headquarters in Lebanon, close to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. After the World War II, Archbishop Tiran Nersoyan led the church through a second founding, which saw the <b>framing</b> <b>of</b> by-laws to govern the diocese, the creation of a nationwide youth organization. the initiation of a project to build an Armenian cathedral in Manhattan and the entry of the Armenian Church into the ecumenical movement. The middle 1950s saw an uptick in immigration and a building boom of Armenian churches, with new communities proliferating across the US. A generation of leaders born in America also began to exert itself. The first American-born Armenian priest was ordained in 1956. In 1961, St. Nersess Armenian Seminary was established in Illinois (later, it would move to New York). A spirit of renewed vigor was embodied by Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, who governed the diocese as primate from 1966 to 1990. The period saw a large influx of Armenian immigrants. These developments refocused the priorities of the Armenian Church in America. The need for humanitarian relief to the Armenian homeland, as well as outreach to refugees settling throughout the US (concentrated in New York and Los Angeles), {{led to the creation of}} the Fund for Armenian Relief—through which the church delivers material and medical aid to Armenia.|$|E

40|$|One {{approach}} {{to ease the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> is to first construct local components and then build a global frame from these.

We introduce this new notion and prove that it provides us with the link we need. It will also turn out that <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces behave as a generalization <b>of</b> <b>frames.</b> In particular, we can define an analysis, a synthesis and a frame operator for a <b>frame</b> <b>of</b> subspaces, which even yield a reconstruction formula. Also concepts such as completeness, minimality, and exactness are introduced and investigated. We further study several constructions <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces, and also <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> and Riesz frames using the theory <b>of</b> <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces. An important special case are harmonic <b>frames</b> <b>of</b> subspaces which generalize harmonic frames. We show that wavelet subspaces coming from multiresolution analysis belong to this class.
