2500|$|If {{the coolant}} {{temperature}} {{is too close}} to its boiling point, cavitation can occur in the pumps and their operation can become erratic or even stop entirely. The feedwater temperature is dependent on the steam production; the steam phase portion is led to the turbines and condensers and returns significantly cooler (...) than the water returning directly from the steam separator (284Â°C). At low reactor power, therefore, the inlet temperature may become dangerously high. The water is kept below the saturation temperature to prevent <b>film</b> <b>boiling</b> and the associated drop in heat transfer rate.|$|E
50|$|The Leidenfrost {{temperature}} is {{the property of}} a given set of solid-liquid pair. The temperature of the solid surface beyond which the liquid undergoes Leidenfrost phenomenon is termed as Leidenfrost temperature. The calculation of Leidenfrost temperature involves the calculation of minimum <b>film</b> <b>boiling</b> temperature of a fluid. Berenson obtained a relation for the minimum <b>film</b> <b>boiling</b> temperature from minimum heat flux arguments. While the equation for the minimum <b>film</b> <b>boiling</b> temperature, {{which can be found}} in the reference above, is quite complex, the features of it can be understood from a physical perspective. One critical parameter to consider is the surface tension. The proportional relationship between the minimum <b>film</b> <b>boiling</b> temperature and surface tension is to be expected since fluids with higher surface tension need higher quantities of heat flux for the onset of nucleate boiling. Since <b>film</b> <b>boiling</b> occurs after nucleate boiling, the minimum temperature for <b>film</b> <b>boiling</b> should have a proportional dependence on the surface tension.|$|E

5000|$|DNB is {{also known}} as Transition boiling, {{unstable}} <b>film</b> <b>boiling,</b> and partial <b>film</b> <b>boiling.</b> For water boiling as shown on the graph, transition boiling occurs when the temperature difference between the surface and the boiling water is approximately [...] to [...] above the TS.

50|$|If {{a surface}} heating the liquid is {{significantly}} hotter than the liquid then <b>film</b> <b>boiling</b> will occur, where {{a thin layer}} of vapor, which has low thermal conductivity, insulates the surface.

50|$|Henry {{developed}} {{a model for}} Leidenfrost phenomenon which includes transient wetting and microlayer evaporation.

While the Leidenfrost temperature is not directly related to the surface tension of the fluid, it is indirectly dependent on it through the <b>film</b> <b>boiling</b> temperature.
