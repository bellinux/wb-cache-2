25|$|A similar {{process known}} as {{hibernation}} occurs naturally in many mammals and also in toads, but not in mice. (Mice can fall into a state called clinical torpor when food shortage occurs). If the -induced hibernation {{can be made to}} work in humans, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in the emergency management of severely injured patients, and in the conservation of donated organs. In 2008, hypothermia induced by hydrogen sulfide for 48 hours was shown to reduce the extent of brain damage caused by experimental stroke in rats.|$|E
25|$|Other {{possible}} {{fractures in}} this area, {{occurring in the}} cuboid, calcaneus, and fibula, can be associated or can {{be mistaken for a}} toddler's fracture. In some cases, an internal oblique radiography and radionuclide imaging can add information to anterior-posterior and lateral views. However, since treatment can also be initiated in the absence of abnormalities, this appears to have little value in most cases. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in special cases such as children with fever, those without a clear trauma or those in which the diagnosis remains unclear. Recently, ultrasound has been suggested as a helpful diagnostic tool.|$|E

25|$|Tarebia granifera {{have been}} {{associated}} with the disappearance of two indigenous benthic gastropod species from rivers in Puerto Rico and have displaced the vegetation-associated pulmonate Biomphalaria glabrata from streams and ponds on several Caribbean islands. Although the responsible mechanism is not understood, this has led to suggestions that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> as a biocontrol agent in snail control operations within integrated schistosomiasis control programmes. They probably also compete for space and resources (e.g. food) with indigenous infaunal and epifaunal invertebrates, especially where its densities are high. Under such conditions it is likely to alter the structure and biodiversity of the entire benthic communities of invaded habitats and perhaps the vegetation-associated communities as well.|$|E
500|$|The Northover Projector {{was issued}} to both Home Guard and regular British Army units, and by August, 1941 over 8,000 Northover Projectors were in service. This number had {{increased}} to 18,919 {{by the beginning}} of 1943. Initial reactions to the Northover Projector were varied, with a number of Home Guard volunteers uncertain about the weapon's unusual design, and some officers never accepted that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b> However, most Home Guard units came to accept the weapon and have confidence in it, aided by large amounts of what Mackenzie terms [...] "War Office propaganda" [...] which cited the positive qualities of the weapon, such as its simplicity of use, ease of manufacture and low maintenance requirements. It was, as one Home Guard volunteer put it, [...] "something to be accepted gratefully until something better arrived." [...] Like many of the obsolete weapons designed for the Home Guard, the Northover Projector was only taken out of service when it could be replaced with [...] "marginally less ineffective" [...] weapons provided by the Army, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E
2500|$|The {{compound}} 13-cis {{retinoic acid}} was first {{studied in the}} 1960s at Roche Laboratories in Switzerland by Werner Bollag {{as a treatment for}} skin cancer. [...] Experiments completed in 1971 showed that the compound was likely to be ineffective for cancer and, surprisingly, that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> to treat acne. [...] However, they also showed that the compound was likely to cause birth defects, so in light of the events around [...] thalidomide, Roche abandoned the product. In 1975, Gary Peck and Frank Yoder independently rediscovered the drug's use as a treatment of cystic acne while studying it as a treatment for lamellar ichthyosis, and published that work. [...] Roche resumed work on the drug. In clinical trials, subjects were carefully screened to avoid including women who were or might become pregnant. [...] Roche's New Drug Application for isotretinoin for the treatment of acne included data showing that the drug caused birth defects in rabbits. The FDA approved the application in 1982.|$|E

2500|$|While {{not finding}} his own {{experiences}} with MDMA particularly powerful, Shulgin {{was impressed with}} the drug's disinhibiting effects and thought <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful</b> in therapy. Believing MDMA allowed users to strip away habits and perceive the world clearly, Shulgin called the drug [...] "window". Shulgin occasionally used MDMA for relaxation, referring to it as [...] "my low-calorie martini", and gave the drug to friends, researchers, and others who he thought could benefit from it. One such person was Leo Zeff, a psychotherapist who had been known to use psychedelic substances in his practice. When he tried the drug in 1977, Zeff {{was impressed with the}} effects of MDMA and came out of his semi-retirement to promote its use in therapy. Over the following years, Zeff traveled around the US and occasionally to Europe, eventually training an estimated four thousand psychotherapists in the therapeutic use of MDMA. Zeff named the drug [...] "Adam", believing it put users in a state of primordial innocence.|$|E
2500|$|She was {{a friend}} of Princess Hedvig Elizabeth Charlotte, who {{described}} her as a truly good friend, witty and cleverly critical in the presence of friends, but also as distant to the world, indifferent to her appearance and often poorly dressed: [...] "Countess Klinckowström is amiable, agreeable, talented and educated, with a reliable character and a friend of her friends. She is otherwise distant to the outside world and observe its foolishness with an inner calm, especially everything which concerns the court. Her observation of events is actually quite satirical, but she is very careful and share her observations only to them whom she has given her confidence. It was with discontent she accepted the position of lady in waiting to the Queen, and only to please her consort, as it was his belief that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful,</b> as he is quite economical and could almost be called stingy. She is most certainly not very entertained by a position, which must trouble her, as she can find no pleasure in dressing herself up; in that aspect she is in fact quite careless." ...|$|E

Comprehending, from the various hints of his friend Touchwood, that the matter was of the last consequence, his own humanity, as well as inexperience, {{dictated}} his sending for skilful assistance. His man-servant was accordingly dispatched on horseback to the Well for Dr. Quackleben; while, upon the suggestion {{of one of his}} maids, [...] "that Mrs. Dods was an uncommon skeely body about a sick-bed," [...] the wench was dismissed to supplicate the assistance of the gudewife of the Cleikum, which she was not, indeed, wont to refuse whenever <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>useful.</b> The male emissary proved, in Scottish phrase, a [...] "corbie messenger;"[II-G] for either he did not find the doctor, or he found him better engaged than to attend the sick-bed of a pauper, at a request which promised such slight remuneration as that of a parish minister. But the female ambassador was more successful; for, though she found our friend Luckie Dods preparing for bed at an hour unusually late, in consequence of some anxiety on account of Mr. Touchwood's unexpected absence, the good old dame only growled a little about the minister's fancies in taking puir bodies into his own house; and then, instantly donning cloak, hood, and pattens, marched down the gate with all the speed of the good Samaritan, one maid bearing the lantern before her, while the other remained to keep the house, and to attend to the wants of Mr. Tyrrel, who engaged willingly to sit up to receive Mr. Touchwood.|$|E
