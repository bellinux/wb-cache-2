Unlike, T.tabacinus however, B.pisciodorus has spores that are hyaline in mass, and dark {{yellowish}} brown rather than hyaline when viewed with a light microscope. Further, B.pisciodorus has a fishy odor that <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> both fresh and dried specimens.|$|E

5|$|Although chest {{radiography}} {{is an important}} part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of sixhours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48hours. When a pulmonary contusion <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} Shaman King, Takei, {{an assistant}} of Nobuhiro Watsuki's Rurouni Kenshin, exchanged {{ideas about the}} series with the other assistants. As a colleague of Watsuki, he worked primarily as a manga assistant, only focusing on his own projects during his days off. He was influenced by street art from hip-hop and rap culture, which <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> his manga artwork. For drawing, he used calligraphy inks and pen nibs. When illustrating, he used Copic brand color markers.|$|E

5|$|Léal Souvenir {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} surviving examples of secular portraiture in medieval European art and one of {{the earliest}} extant unidealised representations. This <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> its realism and acute observation of the details of the man's everyday appearance. Van Eyck worked in the early Renaissance tradition and pioneered the manipulation of oil paint. Oil allowed smooth translucent surfaces, could be applied across a range of thicknesses and was manipulable while wet, which allowed far more subtle detail than available to previous generations of painters.|$|E
5|$|Although {{freshwater}} invertebrates inhabiting and comprising {{algae and}} periphyton make {{the foundation of}} food webs {{in the middle and}} lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding {{on the bottom of the}} river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. Mayport is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 8th {{century as}} {{architectural}} styles evolved, new elements were added as is evident in kasuga-zukuri (Kasuga Shrine and Hakusandō/Kasugadō at Enjō-ji), the flowing roof or nagare-zukuri (Shimogamo Shrine), hachiman-zukuri (Usa Shrine) and hiyoshi-zukuri (Hiyoshi Taisha). The nagare-zukuri continues to be the more popular style, followed by the kasuga-zukuri. The honden of Ujigami Shrine dates to this period. At {{the end of the}} Heian period torii and fences were commonly replaced with two-storied gates and grand colonnades copied from temple architecture. The influence of the residential shinden-zukuri style of palaces and mansions <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> shrines such as Itsukushima Shrine.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, when {{financial}} circumstances forced Manning {{to leave}} school at sixteen, {{she worked as}} a typist, and spent some time as a junior in a beauty salon. A talented artist, she took evening classes at the Portsmouth Municipal School of Art, where a fellow student described her as intellectual and aloof. In May 1928, she had a painting selected for an exhibition at Southsea, and was subsequently offered a one-woman show of her works. Manning seemed to be poised for a career as an artist, but she had meanwhile continued her interest in literature, and at the age of twenty determined instead to be a writer. Her artist's eye <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> her later intense descriptions of landscapes.|$|E
5|$|Modern Yunnan {{in southwestern}} China was annexed into the Han Empire after the {{establishment}} of a Chinese prefecture in 109 BC. Cultural assimilation of the Baiyue tribes was implemented through the teaching of Chinese ethics was supported under the reign of Qin Shi Huang. The growing influence of Chinese culture <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> excavated Dian artifacts, and coins, ceramics, mirrors, and bronzes have been discovered in Dian manufactured with Han stylistic elements. Dian art adopted the aesthetics of Han imports and by 100, the indigenous Dian culture had largely disappeared. Northern Chinese culture had become largely ingrained in the south. The expansion of China from the North China Plain to the south, a process that began in the Qin dynasty, had reached its height under the Han.|$|E
5|$|The {{defensive}} play of Taylor, Oliver, and Johnson greatly {{affected the}} course of the game and <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> Georgia's time of possession and average starting position in each of the quarters. During the first and second quarters, Georgia had average starting positions on their own 19and26-yard lines, respectively. Their first-quarter time of possession was just 5:41, and their second-quarter possession time was 6:34. During the third and fourth quarters, when all four Virginia Tech turnovers took place, Georgia's time of possession jumped to 10:41 and 7:47, respectively. In the third quarter, their average starting possession gained tenyards to the Georgia 36, and during the final quarter, their average starting position was the Virginia Tech 36-yard line. This fact allowed Georgia to capitalize on the Virginia Tech turnovers, turning them into points on the scoreboard.|$|E

5|$|This change <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> the {{writings}} of the Hoysala court poets, some of who are noted for pioneering works in native metres. The Veerashiava poet Harihara, {{one of the most prominent}} poets of the medieval era, established the ragale tradition with his biography of Basavanna (Basavaraja Devara ragale, 1160), the earliest available biography of the social reformer and of the Kannada language as well. His nephew Raghavanka established the shatpadi metre in his unique and original narration of the story of King Harishchandra called Harishchandra Kavya (1200). Sisumayana is credited with introducing a new composition called sangatya (1232) in his allegorical poems Tripuradahana ("Burning of the triple fortress") and Anjanacharita. Some Jain authors continued the champu tradition, such as Janna, immortalised by his writing Yashodhara Charite (1207), a unique set of stories in 310 verses dealing with sadomasochism and transmigration of the soul. The earliest well-known Brahmin writers also emerged during the late 12th century and wrote on themes ranging from Vaishnava faith (Rudrabhatta's Jagannatha Vijaya, 1185) to secular treatises on poetics (Kavi Kama's Sringara Ratnakara, on poetic sentiment and flavor).|$|E

25|$|Acceptance of {{the erotic}} <b>is</b> <b>apparent</b> <b>in</b> {{the work and}} {{behavior}} of some artists, for example Picasso was also famous for having a series of model/muse/mistresses through his life: Marie-Thérèse Walter, Fernande Olivier, Dora Maar, and Françoise Gilot. The painter John Currin, whose work is often erotic, combines images from popular culture and references to his wife, Rachel Feinstein.|$|E
