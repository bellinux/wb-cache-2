40|$|High {{fidelity}} three-dimensional simulations {{are employed}} {{to examine the}} effect of distortion on an injection strat-egy for supersonic combustion at a Mach 6 flight. Two types of streamline-traced inlets, denoted “Scoop ” and “Jaws”, are connected to a common combustor. Steady and unsteady simulations are described with the full Reynolds Aver-aged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations supplemented with the k − ω model for turbulence. The new results, which factor the distortion associated with the inlets, are compared to cases in which the inflow to the combustor was as-sumed to be uniform. In addition to examining the flow structures created by inlet distortion, the performance is also characterized by quantitative values of fuel-air mixing efficiency, pressure losses and thrust ratios. Overall, the effect of distortion depends on the inlet design. For Jaws, the increased pressure loss associated with distortion is mitigated slightly by improved mixing efficiency and better thrust performance.

40|$|AbstractIn {{patients}} with isomeric atrial appendages, regurgitation of atrioventricular valves is recognized clinically {{as one of}} the risk factors that militate against successful achievement of definitive repairs. To determine whether this reflected anatomic features, we investigated 91 specimens with atrioventricular septal defect that had a common atrioventricular valve and biventricular atrioventricular connections. Of these specimens, 35 had isomeric right appendages, 23 showed isomeric left appendages, and 33 had usual atrial arrangement. We measured either the size or location of the supporting papillary muscles and the circumference of the mural leaflet within the morphologically systemic ventricle, as well as the length of outlet, <b>inlet,</b> and so-called <b>scooped</b> dimensions of the muscular ventricular septum. Presence of a solitary papillary muscle, or deviation of the attachments of the papillary muscles, was more frequent in hearts with isomeric right appendages. Values for the diameter and lengths of the papillary muscles were significantly smaller in hearts with isomeric right appendages compared with those with usual atrial arrangement (p < 0. 001), as were the distances between the papillary muscles (p < 0. 002) and the circumference of the mural leaflet (p < 0. 001). The proportional length of ventricular outlet was longer in the setting of isomeric right appendages than in the other groups (p < 0. 001), whereas the extent of septal scooping showed no differences among these three groups.

40|$|To {{advance the}} design of {{hypersonic}} vehicles, high-fidelity multi-physics CFD is used to characterize 3 -D scramjet flow-fields in two novel streamline traced configurations. The two <b>inlets,</b> Jaws and <b>Scoop,</b> are analyzed and compared to a traditional rectangular inlet used as a baseline for on/off-design conditions. The flight trajectory conditions selected are Mach 6 and a dynamic pressure of 1, 500 psf (71. 82 kPa). Analysis of these hypersonic inlets is performed to investigate distortion effects downstream with multiple single cavity combustors acting as flame holders, and several fuel injection strategies. The best integrated scramjet inlet/combustor design is identified. The flow physics is investigated and the integrated performance impact of the two innovative scramjet inlet designs is quantified. Frozen and finite rate chemistry is simulated with 13 gaseous species and 20 reactions for an Ethylene/air finite-rate chemical model. In addition, URANS and LES modeling are compared to explore overall flow structure and to contrast individual numerical methods. The flow distortion in Jaws and Scoop is similar {{to some of the}} distortion in the traditional rectangular inlet, despite design differences. The baseline and Jaws performance attributes are stronger than Scoop, but Jaws accomplishes this while eradicating the cowl lip interaction, and lessening the total drag and spillage penalties. The innovative inlets work best on-design, whereas for off-design, the traditional inlet is best. Early pressure losses and flow distortions in the isolator aid the mixing of air and fuel, and improve the overall efficiency of the system. Although the trends observed with and without chemical reactions are similar, the former yields roughly 10 % higher mixing efficiency and upstream reactions are present. These show a significant impact on downstream development. Unsteadiness in the combustor increases the mixing efficiency, varying the flame anchoring and combustion pressure effects upstream of the step. Ph. D. Committee Chair: Dr. Stephen M.

40|$|Competitive {{performance}} of an F 1 race car relies upon a well designed and highly developed aerodynamic system. In {{order to achieve}} this, total understanding of the downstream wake of exposed rotating wheels is essential. Components such as bargeboards and indeed much of the front wing are developed to provide pressure gradients and vortex structures to influence the wheel wake, ensuring high energy mass-flow to the sensitive {{leading edge of the}} underfloor and eventually the rear wing. Wind tunnel testing of model-scale deformable tyres has become a common occurrence in F 1 in recent years although there is a significant lack of available literature, academic or otherwise, as to their use. This work has studied in detail the aerodynamic consequences which occur from the varying sidewall bulge and contact patch region making use of several techniques. These include scanning rotating tyre profiles under load, static contact patch size measurements, five-hole pressure probe wake measurements, particle image velocimetry (PIV) and load-cell drag measurements. CFD simulations utilising two industrial codes have also been performed to support the experimental work. Coordinates representing tyre profiles under a range of on-track conditions are available for other researchers to use as a basis for CFD studies. The work presented here includes a full range of representative on-track axle heights which far exceed the more conservative range usually tested in an industrial setting for longevity reasons. The most sensitive parameters for aerodynamic testing of wheels have been identified. For development of a full car, in decreasing order of priority, the following must be correctly matched to the realistic scenario: axle height, yaw condition (without glycerol - often used to reduce friction at the expense of a compromised tyre profile), camber angle, detailed internals, high inflation pressure, through-hub flow rate and least significantly the rotation of the internal brake rotor. The study of through-hub flows revealed that the external aerodynamic effect of the brake <b>scoop</b> <b>inlet</b> varies significantly with the amount of internal restriction. The pumping effect of the brake rotor was measured to be negligible compared to the restrictive effect of its internal passages and that leads to an effect known as inlet spillage with a negative cooling drag trend, whereby the drag of the wheel assembly decreases with increased through-hub flow...|$|R
40|$|The JAS 39 Gripen {{currently}} has a static air inlet designed for cooling the engine bay. This inlet {{has been developed}} {{over the years and}} has consisted of several different solutions. In this master’s thesis an investigation of past and current designs has been conducted in order to develop new concepts with a variable solution. Since the static inlet is designed for a worst case scenario, long duration of flight at low altitudes and high atmospheric temperatures, the cooling produced is not always needed and instead causes an unnecessary amount of drag. Developing concepts with variable solutions would alter the caption area depending on flight case and thereby decrease drag accordingly. Both aerodynamic and airworthiness properties are important to consider when developing concepts of an air inlet. Initially a concept generation was conducted in order to create possible concepts for implementation. 14 concepts were generated, evaluated and analyzed resulting in two concepts chosen based on their superior aerodynamic and airworthiness properties. Screening was done with both a Pugh matrix as well as a scoring matrix. One of the selected concepts has a similar design to the current <b>scoop</b> <b>inlet,</b> but with a variable solution. The second is a variable NACA duct design. An alternative solution briefly discussed was that of a static design, with different caption areas, attached to the service door depending on location of operation and flight conditions but is only theoretical at this point. The advantage of implementing the NACA concept would be the decrease in drag since it is a flush inlet. The weight and radar cross section (RCS) are both considered to be low when compared to the scoop concept. Shortcomings of the NACA concept would include the uncertainty in performance concerning cooling and producing sufficient mass flow, as well as the uncertainty in case of bird strike. The scoop concept is similar to the current design and therefore is a verified design with satisfactory bird strike properties as well as having a high probability of producing sufficient mass flow. When compared to the NACA duct it has disadvantages concerning drag, weight, RCS and foreign object damage...|$|R
