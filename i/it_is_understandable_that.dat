5|$|Thomas Hall {{crossed his}} Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was {{satisfied}} with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, Soviet {{citizens}} endured the brunt of two world wars, two revolutions (1905 & 1917), a devastating Civil War, and a number of famines. In addition, there was some severe political repression, notably the Great Purge in the 1930s, which led to many people being sent to the Gulag. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> under such circumstances, a team sport such as rugby could not flourish and was low on the list of people's priorities. Only with the less repressive regime of the post-Stalin period did Soviet rugby begin to establish a firm base.|$|E
25|$|Also {{important}} was the growth of urban centers, {{the vast majority of}} which were Muslim. Cities that were founded at the time, such as Sarajevo and Mostar, grew rapidly with a specifically Islamic character and advanced living standards. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> many Christians in the outlying rural regions would convert to Islam {{to be part of the}} superior conditions in such places. Further, slaves who converted to Islam could petition for their freedom, and many of the Christians enslaved during the wars with Habsburg Austria, Hungary, and the Republic of Venice converted to Islam in order to secure their release. Many of these newly freed converts settled in the growing cities, further contributing to their growth and development.|$|E
50|$|The Boyds were {{considered}} among the most prominent families of Hawaii, and their residence in Maunawili was often frequented by Hawaiian royalty, visiting foreign dignitaries, and world-famous writers and artists. Boyd's father made his fortune as a merchant and cattle rancher and served many political posts in the Kingdom's legislature, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> James would follow in his footsteps.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, touring, {{for so long}} a pilgrimage for the Devil's Nite faithful, was {{starting}} to slow down for the band. August has said, [...] "some members of the band {{felt that they had}} earned the right to play for more national acts, and as a result, some local shows actually started getting turned down; in retrospect, and although in a sense <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>understandable,</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> probably the beginning of the writing appearing on the wall".|$|R
30|$|However, {{this study}} found that {{risk-taking}} {{was not a significant}} factor that affected entrepreneurial intention. The finding supported Robinson and Stubberud (2014) and Ekpe and Mat (2012) but was dissimilar to Yurtkoru et al. (2014), Bolton and Lane (2012) and Kropp et al. (2008). Entrepreneurship is a process which requires the entrepreneurs to assume risk. Thus, low risk-taking ability would definitely hinder the individuals from taking up entrepreneurial activities. Furthermore, students were lacking of the necessary resources in becoming entrepreneurs; thus, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> their risk-taking ability did not drive them towards entrepreneurship.|$|R
25|$|Women are {{becoming}} more confident {{in the workplace and}} are trying harder to step up in their career. More and more of these women want to fit into the management level by trying to emulate men via fashion and outward appearance to appear more masculine and powerful. Most of the higher position in the work field were occupied by man at that time, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> how womenswear is influenced by man’s figure and body feature to mock the general existing powerful image at that time. Hence, they would want garments that empower them and make them look more masculine in shape, thus making the woman appear to be more capable of higher level tasks and seem more professional by fitting in with the male majority. This would be accomplished with attributes such as wider shoulders with the aid of padding and larger sleeves.|$|E
25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the reign of}} two emperors bent on supporting the Church and stamping out paganism, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> pagans simply did not embrace Julian's idea of proclaiming their devotion to polytheism and their rejection of Christianity. Many chose to adopt a practical approach and not support Julian's public reforms actively for fear of a Christian revival. However, this apathetic attitude forced the emperor to shift central aspects of pagan worship. Julian’s attempts to reinvigorate the people shifted the focus of paganism from a system of tradition to a religion {{with some of the}} same characteristics that he opposed in Christianity. For example, Julian attempted to introduce a tighter organization for the priesthood, with greater qualifications of character and service. Classical paganism simply did not accept this idea of priests as model citizens. Priests were elites with social prestige and financial power who organized festivals and helped pay for them. Yet Julian’s attempt to impose moral strictness on the civic position of priesthood only made paganism more in tune with Christian morality, drawing it further from paganism’s system of tradition.|$|E

50|$|Once {{again the}} German Foreign Ministry sent Ludwig Weissauer to Finland May 5, {{this time to}} clarify that war between Germany and the Soviet Union would not be {{launched}} before spring 1942. Ryti and Witting believed that, at least officially, and forwarded the message to Swedish Foreign Minister Günther, who was visiting Finland May 6-9. Witting also sent the information to Finnish-ambassador-to-London Gripenberg. When the war broke out {{only a couple of}} weeks later, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> both Swedish and British governments felt that the Finns had lied to them.|$|R

They stopped the trucks -- they didn't stop the truck, they slowed down a little bit, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just like response, the guys got up, including the lieutenants, and just blew all the kids away. There were {{about five or six}} kids blown away, and then the truck just continued down the hill." ...|$|R
50|$|Criticism {{leveled against}} Raja for allying with English East India Company during his wars with Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan is not {{rational}} {{in light of}} an analysis of contemporary South Indian history. Raja allied with Company initially {{not because he was}} a vassal of British, but because Mysore was enemy of both. Before 1792, Malabar suffered from rapacity of Mysore rule and British were only a merchant power who had not yet harmed people of Malabar. So <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> many leader of Malabar - Pazhassi Raja included - allied with British to fight Mysore rulers like Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan.|$|R
500|$|The Sages of the Talmud {{stated that}} anyone who prays at the Temple in Jerusalem, [...] "it is {{as if he has}} prayed before the throne of glory because the gate of heaven is {{situated}} there and it is open to hear prayer." [...] Jewish Law stipulates that the Silent Prayer should be recited facing towards Jerusalem, the Temple and ultimately the Holy of Holies, as God's bounty and blessing emanates from that spot. It is generally believed that prayer by the Western Wall is particularly beneficial since it was that wall which was situated closest to the Holy of Holies. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger writes [...] "since the gate of heaven is near the Western Wall, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> all Israel's prayers ascend on high there... {{as one of the great}} ancient kabbalists Rabbi Joseph Gikatilla said, when the Jews send their prayers from the Diaspora in the direction of Jerusalem, from there they ascend by way of the Western Wall." [...] A well-known segula (efficacious remedy) for finding one's soulmate is to pray for 40 consecutive days at the Western Wall, a practice apparently conceived by Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher.|$|E
500|$|Soap opera {{commentator}} Jenn Bishop {{said she}} {{found it difficult to}} explain Todd's popularity, and that if she is perplexed about her feelings regarding him, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> others would be as well. [...] "If I were to give a surface level assessment of Todd, I'd say he's an abhorrent character with little to no redeeming qualities," [...] she said. [...] "His actions, which span from the immoral to criminal, can be downright heinous. I wouldn't want to know Todd, let alone be around him in real life. Nor would I want any woman to have any sort of relationship with him." [...] Instead of seeing Todd as an antihero, she saw him as more of [...] "an anti-anti-hero" [...] and stated that what added to his appeal was that his rape storyline was authentic. [...] "While Todd is not the first (or the last) soap character to have committed this crime, the realness of this particular storyline didn't leave {{a lot of room for}} rewrites," [...] Bishop commented. [...] "For example, Luke's rape of Laura on General Hospital was rewritten and for years was referred to as a 'seduction.' There was no 'grey area'. This [...] could not be dismissed as simply the behavior of a romantic rogue." [...] To Bishop, the end result of this aspect, and that the writers had Todd generally pay for his crimes, [...] "was the development of a dynamic, unpredictable, multi-faceted character with many traits that conflict with one another" [...] and [...] "ll this makes for one messed up guy, intriguing to the viewers and one I can't help but like".|$|E

30|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{intuitively}} <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> {{the presence}} of a layer reduces the available density of states for given energy, or equivalently increases the Fermi energy for a given density of electrons.

5000|$|After such {{a flurry}} of excitement, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> perhaps <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> the players regrouped in the {{following}} game, which was a short 27 move draw.

40|$|So far, a {{critique}} has been forwarded toward the legal education systemin Indonesia which produced many law scholars but having no grasp {{in terms of}} sociological perspective. The writer contends that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> no longer justified to let this situation goes as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> since {{there are so many}} complexities, unfairness and indiscrimination staying in our legal body but too little effort to revise them by those legal practitioners. To understand this, the writer asks to look back to situation of where Indonesia was still occupied by the Dutch. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> the colonial government had interests in seeing Indonesian’s law scholars who were skillful in applying the law made by the colonial government rather than being critical to those.

50|$|At the {{orchestra}}l rehearsals, Lyatoshinsky {{noted that}} ‘members {{of the orchestra}} were divided’‹see Lyatoshinsky's letter, in M.

Lyatoshinsky replied that he was surprised of such a reception and {{could not believe that}} ‘musicians from Moscow could allow such a rude unethical attack’ towards him. He admitted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> there would <b>be</b> different opinions about his composition, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a work of a formalist. ‘I have written it sincerely’, carried on Lyatoshinsky, ‘using my own characteristic musical language’. After his speech, the orchestra musicians ‘were shouting so much as if someone was physically attacked’ and ‘emotions <b>were</b> high’. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> unfortunate for Lyatoshinsky that a representative from the newspaper Musica, D.

Lyatoshinsky recalled that he had ‘never heard such destructive criticism’ in all his life.|$|R
50|$|The {{physical}} {{environment in which}} the Yahgan people lived was relatively poor in land resources, and historically they spent little time in the interior. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>understandable,</b> then, <b>that</b> the vocabulary reflects this.

40|$|This {{article will}} argue that the United States had no convincing reason for not joining the {{international}} consensus to create an effective ICC. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>understandable</b> <b>that</b> a state would not normally wish its personnel to be subject to an external body's jurisdiction, there were enough safeguards in the Statute against its abusive and/or political use. In this sense, the concern was not reasonable or defensible. To eliminate any risk of its military personnel being prosecuted under the Statute, the United States isolated itself at a time when its engagement and leadership were crucial to the prevention of crimes that shocked the human conscience. Its decision not to ratify the Statute was therefore ill conceived and could be seen as a bid to exist above the community of states or the rule of law in total disregard for the formidable consensus on this issue. It could find that this self-imposed isolation on such an important principle could be contrary to its best interest once the ICC became fully operational. 17 page(s...|$|R
