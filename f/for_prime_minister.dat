5|$|The Conservatives {{began the}} {{campaign}} period with a policy-per-day strategy, {{contrary to the}} Liberal plan of holding off major announcements until after the Christmas holidays, so Harper dominated media coverage for the first weeks of the election. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal numbers, which had always significantly trailed those of his party, began to rise. In response, the Liberals launched negative ads targeting Harper, similar to their attacks in the 2004 election. However, their tactics were not sufficient to erode the Conservative's advantage, although they did manage to close {{what had been a}} ten-point advantage in public opinion. As Harper's personal numbers rose, polls found he was now considered not only more trustworthy, but a better choice <b>for</b> <b>prime</b> <b>minister</b> than Martin.|$|E
5|$|The LPF {{decided to}} {{maintain}} Fortuyn's candidacy, and delayed naming {{a new leader}} until after the election. The 2002 general election proved a great success for the LPF, yielding 17% of the votes and 26 seats in the House of Representatives—by far {{a record number of}} seats in the Netherlands for a new party—to become the second largest party. LN also made it into Parliament, with two seats. The Labour Party (PvdA) and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) saw their largest-ever losses, while the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) won large gains. CDA leader Jan Peter Balkenende had earlier announced that his party would follow a tougher line towards asylum seekers, and he later agreed with much of Fortuyn's criticism of the purple coalition and Holland's multicultural society. As leader of the strongest party, Balkenende became the leading candidate <b>for</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister.</b>|$|E
5|$|By noon, the Lithuanians {{received}} a reply from Moscow stating that Raštikis {{was not a}} suitable candidate <b>for</b> <b>Prime</b> <b>Minister.</b> The selection of another candidate would be supervised by Molotov's deputy Vladimir Dekanozov. Merkys continued to act as Prime Minister. Smetona, who continued to disagree {{with the majority of}} his government, decided to leave the country in protest and appointed Merkys as acting President. By late evening on June 15, Smetona and Minister of Defense Kazys Musteikis reached Kybartai and crossed the border into Germany, where they were granted temporary asylum. The Lithuanian guards did not allow them to pass; thus, Smetona had to wade across the shallow Liepona rivulet. Smetona′s departure worked to the Soviets′ advantage; its indignity opened him to ridicule {{and they were able to}} exploit the sentiments against him without fearing that he would be seen as a martyr. By fleeing, Smetona escaped the fate of Latvian President Kārlis Ulmanis and Estonian President Konstantin Päts, who were manipulated by the Soviets and later arrested. Under the Lithuanian constitution, Merkys became acting president.|$|E
