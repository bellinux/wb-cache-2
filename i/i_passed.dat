25|$|The first {{substantial}} Jewish {{population in}} England arrived after the Norman Conquest, reportedly migrating from Rouen in Normandy. By the mid-12th century, there were Jewish communities {{in most of}} England's major cities. Although there were violent anti-Jewish massacres and riots in several cities, Jews were theoretically {{under the protection of}} the Crown because of the their financial importance. However, in 1275, King Edward <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> the Statute of Jewry, which compelled Jews to be identified by a yellow badge and outlawed usury, the lending of money for interest, which was the main source of income for many Jewish families. Following increasing state persecution and attempts to force conversion to Christianity, Edward finally expelled all Jews from England in 1290.|$|E

25|$|Markets and fairs were a {{key element}} in the town's economy in medieval times. The Market Square came to {{prominence}} in 1235 when Henry III ordered that the selling of goods in the churchyard of All Saint's should be relocated to the Market Square. Street names in the town give an indication of trades and market centres; Corn Hill, Malt Hill, Mercer Row, Gold Street, Sheep Street and Horse Market. Cloth and wool were very important but these industries declined. In the 13th century, Northampton had a large Jewish population centred on Gold Street. In 1277two years after Edward <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> the Statute of the Jewrysome Jewish residents were executed while the remainder were driven out of town. Archaeological sites include a medieval Jewish cemetery and the Northampton Medieval Synagogue.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Tomarken asked Larson why {{he decided}} not to pass his {{remaining}} spins before he did, considering the lead he rapidly gained over Litras and Long.

Daley was elected to his first party office as a delegate to the 1969 Illinois Constitutional Convention.|$|E

On the day that King Edward <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> through Newcastle in December 1299 the brethren each {{received}} three shillings and four pence (3s. 4d). In 1306, the King also granted the monastery additional lands to enlarge the burial ground. Richard II directed the bailiffs of the city to issue a proclamation against dumping waste near the site. Apparently some local people threw [...] "excrements, filth, and garbage, in a certain way that led near to the house of the Austin Friars, to their great annoyance and peril." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about his}} pass on Räikkönen {{in the closing}} laps, Massa said that [...] "it was {{the best time for}} me in the race, I was quite strong and then I caught him and <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> him." [...] Since the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix, where Barrichello ceded the lead to Michael Schumacher, team orders have been banned in Formula One. Räikkönen {{appeared}} unbothered when asked about Massa's pass: [...] "I mean we know what we want as a team and that's what we did it. It is normal in these situations." [...] No investigation was undertaken by the stewards at the race. GrandPrix.com played down the incident, saying [...] "Anyone who understands racing understood {{what was going on and}} only the silly people objected." ...|$|E
500|$|To Soyer, {{near the}} time of departure, Florence Nightingale {{acknowledged}} favourable views of Seacole, consistent with their one known meeting in Scutari. Soyer's remarks—he knew both women—show pleasantness on both sides. Seacole told him of her encounter with Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital: [...] "You must know, M Soyer, that Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> through Scutari, she very kindly gave me board and lodging." [...] When he related Seacole's inquiries to Nightingale, she replied [...] "with a smile: 'I should {{like to see her}} before she leaves, as I hear she has done a deal of good for the poor soldiers.'" [...] Nightingale, however, did not want her nurses associating with Seacole, as she wrote to her brother-in-law.|$|E

500|$|On 15 June 1910, Bogdan Žerajić {{attempted}} {{to kill the}} iron-fisted Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, General Marijan Varešanin. Žerajić was a 22-year-old Orthodox Serb from Nevesinje, Herzegovina, who {{was a student at}} the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb and made frequent trips to Belgrade. (General Verešanin went on to crush the last Bosnian peasant uprising {{in the second half of}} 1910.) The five bullets Žerajić fired at Varešanin and the fatal bullet he put in his own brain made Žerajić an inspiration to future assassins, including Princip and Princip's accomplice Čabrinović. Princip said that Žerajić [...] "was my first model. When I was seventeen <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> whole nights at his grave, reflecting on our wretched condition and thinking of him. It is there that I made up my mind sooner or later to perpetrate an outrage." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{positive}} towards the song. In the Entertainment Weekly {{review of the}} album, critic David Browne wrote: [...] "Songs like 'In My Place' and 'Warning Sign' marry lyrics imbued with deep regret and mistakes (...You were an island / And <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> you by in the touching latter song) with lyrical melodies and guitar hooks that twinkle and sparkle." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "When the shimmering, pretty lead-off single 'In My Place' represents the album's weakest moment, you know you've got something extraordinary. Currently storming the charts a la 'Yellow', 'In My Place' is another surprisingly simple song, carried by Jonny Buckland's chiming guitar and Chris Martin’s heartfelt vocals. It really shouldn't amount to much, but Coldplay make it work very well. When Martin sings, [...] "Please, please, please/Come back and sing to me," [...] he totally sells it, and you buy it. And why not? The song's lovely.|$|E
500|$|In a 2003 interview, Jordison {{explained}} {{that despite the}} initial problems more than enough material was written for the album and added that [...] "it's better to have stuff to pick from than to settle for shit", in contrast to how Slipknot settled too soon with fewer songs on previous albums. Band members were divided over their experience of working with producer Rubin; some doubted his commitment to Slipknot as he split his time between many artists at once. Lead vocalist Corey Taylor admitted {{in an interview that}} he drank heavily throughout their time in the mansion, saying [...] "I would drink from the moment I got up until the moment <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> out." [...] He {{explained that}}; [...] "everything I did while I was drinking sounded like shit", while expressing how unhappy he was with the choice of vocal takes which ended up on the album. During this time, percussionist Crahan worked on , a video documenting the creation process of the album and the touring which would follow.|$|E

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>Pass</b> for Humans {{independent}} {{release and}} distribution has left its audience limited. Reviews have been mixed. Mainstream critics, {{in this case}} from Variety Magazine and Joblo Media, were impressed by the films special effects and acting but felt the narrative was wanting. Independent reviewers such as DVD Verdict were more supportive, declaring <b>I</b> <b>Pass</b> for Human [...] "works quite nicely".|$|R
500|$|The Russian {{characters}} {{from the start}} of the episode came from a [...] "great" [...] Russian acting community in Vancouver, British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union. Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12–14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed between his lips to give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it. Show tunes come to mind, but I also remember this one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me. <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> the test." ...|$|E
500|$|Part of the {{enduring}} folklore of the Titanic sinking {{is that the}} musicians played the hymn [...] "Nearer, My God, to Thee" [...] as the ship sank, but {{this appears to be}} dubious. The claim surfaced among the earliest reports of the sinking, and the hymn became so closely associated with the Titanic disaster that its opening bars were carved on the grave monument of Titanics bandmaster, Wallace Hartley, one of those who perished. Violet Jessop said in her 1934 account of the disaster that she had heard the hymn being played. In contrast, Archibald Gracie emphatically denied it in his own account, written soon after the sinking, and Radio Operator Harold Bride said that he had heard the band playing ragtime, then [...] "Autumn", by which he may have meant Archibald Joyce's then-popular waltz [...] "Songe d'Automne" [...] (Autumn Dream). George Orrell, the bandmaster of the rescue ship, Carpathia, who spoke with survivors, related: [...] "The ship's band in any emergency is expected to play to calm the passengers. After Titanic struck the iceberg the band began to play bright music, dance music, comic songs– anything that would prevent the passengers from becoming panic-stricken... various awe-stricken passengers began to think of the death that faced them and asked the bandmaster to play hymns. The one which appealed to all was 'Nearer My God to Thee'." [...] According to Gracie, who was near the band until that section of deck went under, the tunes played by the band were [...] "cheerful" [...] but he didn't recognise any of them, claiming that if they had played 'Nearer, My God, to Thee' as claimed in the newspaper [...] "I assuredly should have noticed it and regarded it as a tactless warning of immediate death to us all and one likely to create panic." [...] Several survivors who were among the last to leave the ship claimed that the band continued playing until the slope of the deck became too steep for them to stand, Gracie claimed that the band stopped playing at least 30 minutes before the vessel sank. Several witnesses support this account including A. H. Barkworth, a first-class passenger who testified: [...] "I do not wish to detract from the bravery of anybody, but I might mention that when I first came on deck the band was playing a waltz. The next time <b>I</b> <b>passed</b> where the band was stationed, the members had thrown down their instruments and were not to be seen." ...|$|E
