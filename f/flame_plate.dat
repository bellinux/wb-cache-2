40|$|The role of {{turbulence}} in {{pollutant formation}} was investigated both experimentally and analytically {{with the objective}} of understanding the important mechanisms of a fairly basic level. Preliminary measurements of the cold-flow turbulence characteristics downstream of three perforated <b>plate</b> <b>flame</b> holders, of varying solidity ratio, were made. In the combustion experiment, measurements of the concentration distributions of CO, NO(x), HC, and CO 2, downstream of the same flame holders, were made. The combustor configuration was tubular and constant-area, and the fuel was premixed, prevaporized propane. The experimental results were modeled by a one-dimensional analysis in which transport phenomena were neglected, and more successfully, by a quasi-one-dimensional analysis containing recirculation zones and turbulent transport effects...|$|R

The strain rate of the burnt gases can be calculated knowing the velocity profile. This strain rate is an important parameter which affects the heat flux from the <b>flame</b> to the <b>plate</b> a lot. Both non-viscous and viscous gas flows are discussed. An expression for the heat flux is derived by implementing the expression for the velocity in the energy equation for the burnt gases close to the plate. The results of the analytical approximations are compared to calculations performed with Fluent. The outcome of the numerical calculations show good agreement with the analytical results...|$|R

50|$|Experimental {{preparation}} {{requires that}} the trough and barriers be thoroughly cleaned by a solvent such as ethanol to remove any residual organics. The liquid subphase is added to a height such that the meniscus just touches the barriers. Often {{it is necessary to}} aspirate the surface of the liquid in order to remove any last remaining impurities. The amphiphilic molecules dissolved in solvent are slowly dropped onto the liquid surface using a microsyringe, with care being taken to spread it uniformly across the surface. Some time must be taken to allow for evaporation of the solvent, and the spreading of the amphiphile. The Wilhelmy plate to be used must be absolutely clean. A platinum plate must stripped of any organics with a solvent or heated by a <b>flame.</b> The Wilhelmy <b>plate</b> is then mounted on the electrobalance such that it is immersed perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} liquid and a uniform meniscus is achieved.

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} {{techniques to}} characterize the response of premixed methane-air flames to acoustic waves are discussed and applied to a multi-slit Bunsen burner. The steady flame shape, flame front kinematics and flow field of acoustically exited flames, {{as well as the}} flame transfer function and matrix are computed. The numerical results are compared with experiments. The influence of changes in the mean flow velocity, mixture equivalence ratio, slit width and distance between the slits on the transfer function is studied, both numerically and experimentally. Good agreement is found which indicates the suitability of both the experimental and numerical approach and shows the importance of predicting the influence of the flow on the flame and vice versa. On the basis of the results obtained, the role and physical nature of convective flow structures, heat transfer between the <b>flame</b> and burner <b>plate</b> and interaction between adjacent flames are discussed.

40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the heat transfer and CO/NOX emissions of a premixed LPG/air circular flame jet impinging upwards normally to a flat rectangular plate. Temperatures of the impingement plate were controlled by cooling water at 38 °C, 58 °C and 78 °C which was circulating at its back {{in order to create}} different plate temperatures. Under each plate temperature, the effects of Reynolds number (Re), equivalence ratio (Ф) and nozzle-to-plate distance (H) on the heat transfer and CO/NOX emissions were examined. The Re was selected to be 500, 1000 and 1500 to ensure laminar flame jets. The values of Фwere chosen to cover fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich conditions. The H varied from 3 dto 7 d with an interval of 1 d. The flame-side temperature of the impingement plate is enhanced when the cooling water temperature increases, but the temperature difference across the impingement plate is reduced. Heat transfer from the <b>flame</b> to the <b>plate</b> is suppressed at higher cooling water temperature. The heat transfer rate is the highest when the cooling water temperature is at 38 °C and the lowest heat flux is obtained at 78 °C. At the highest cooling water temperature of 78 °C, the CO emission is reduced whereas the NOX emission is enhanced. However, this trend is reversed at the lowest cooling water temperature of 38 °C.

40|$|Experimental {{studies were}} carried out to {{investigate}} the flame shape and the heat transfer and wall pressure characteristics of a pair of laminar premixed butane/air flame jets impinging vertically upon a horizontal water-cooled flat plate at jet Reynolds numbers of 800, 1000 and 1200, respectively. Equivalence ratio of the butane/air mixture was maintained constantly at unity. The flame shape, the pressure distribution on the impingement plate and the heat transfer from the <b>flame</b> to the <b>plate</b> were greatly influenced by the interference occurred between the two flame jets. This interference caused a sharp pressure peak at the between-jet midpoint and the positive pressures at the between-jet area, which led to the separation of the wall jet from the impingement plate after collision. Such interference became more significant when the non-dimensional jet-to-jet spacing (S/d) and the nozzle-to-plate distance (H/d) were reduced. Heat transfer in the interaction zone between the jets was at the lowest rate due to this interference at the smallest S/d ratio of 2. 6, resulting from the separation of the high-temperature inner reaction zone of the flame from the impingement plate. On the other hand, the interference enhanced the heat transfer in the interaction zone between the jets when the S/d ratio was greater than 5, by enhancing the heat transfer coefficient. The average heat flux of the impingement plate was found to increase significantly with the increasing H/d ratio until H/d= 6. The present study provided detailed information on flame shape and the heat transfer and wall pressure characteristics of a twin laminar pre-mixed impinging circular flame jets, which has rarely been reported in previous studies.

40|$|As NASA's mission evolves, new {{spacecraft}} {{and habitat}} environments necessitate expanded study of materials flammability. Most of the upward burning tests to date, including the NASA standard material screening method NASA-STD- 6001, {{have been conducted}} in small chambers where the flame often terminates before a steady state flame is established. In real environments, the same limitations may not be present. The use of long fuel samples would allow the flames to proceed in an unhindered manner. In order to explore sample size and chamber size effects, two large chambers were developed at NASA GRC under the Flame Prevention, Detection and Suppression (FPDS) project. The first was an existing vacuum facility, VF- 13, located at NASA John Glenn Research Center. This 6350 liter chamber could accommodate fuels sample lengths up to 2 m. However, operational costs and restricted accessibility limited the test program, so a second laboratory scale facility was developed in parallel. By stacking additional two chambers {{on top of an}} existing combustion chamber facility, this 81 liter Stacked-chamber facility could accommodate a 1. 5 m sample length. The larger volume, more ideal environment of VF- 13 was used to obtain baseline data for comparison with the stacked chamber facility. In this way, the stacked chamber facility was intended for long term testing, with VF- 13 as the proving ground. Four different solid fuels (adding machine paper, poster paper, PMMA plates, and Nomex fabric) were tested with fuel sample lengths up to 2 m. For thin samples (papers) with widths up to 5 cm, the flame reached a steady state length, which demonstrates that flame length may be stabilized even when the edge effects are reduced. For the thick PMMA <b>plates,</b> <b>flames</b> reached lengths up to 70 cm but were highly energetic and restricted by oxygen depletion. Tests with the Nomex fabric confirmed that the cyclic flame phenomena, observed in small facility tests, continued over longer sample. New features were also observed at the higher oxygen/pressure conditions available in the large chamber. Comparison of flame behavior between the two facilities under identical conditions revealed disparities, both qualitative and quantitative. This suggests that, in certain ranges of controlling parameters, chamber size and shape {{could be one of the}} parameters that affect the material flammability. If this proves to be true, it may limit the applicability of existing flammability data...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} use of electric fields as one mechanism for controlling combustion as flames are partially extinguished when impinging on nearby surfaces. Electrical aspects of flames, specifically, the production of chemi-ions in hydrocarbon flames and {{the use of}} convective flows driven by these ions, have been investigated {{in a wide range of}} applications in prior work but despite this fairly comprehensive effort to study electrical aspects of combustion, relatively little research has focused on electrical phenomena near flame extinguishment, nor for flames near impingement surfaces. Electrical impinging flames have complex properties under global influences of ion-driven winds and flow field disturbances from the impingement surface. Challenges of measurements when an electric field is applied in the system have limited an understanding of changes to the flame behavior and species concentrations caused by the field. This research initially characterizes the ability of high voltage power supplies to respond on sufficiently short time scales to permit real time electrical flame actuation. The study then characterizes the influence of an electric field on the impinging flame shape, ion current and flow field of the thermal plume associated with the flame. The more significant further examinations can be separated into two parts: 1) the potential for using electric fields to control the release of carbon monoxide (CO) from surface-impinging flames, and 2) an investigation of controlling electrically the heat transfer to a plate on which the flame impinges. Carbon monoxide (CO) results from the incomplete oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels and, while CO can be desirable in some syngas processes, it is usually a dangerous emission from forest fires, gas heaters, gas stoves, or furnaces where insufficient oxygen in the core reaction does not fully oxidize the fuel to carbon dioxide and water. Determining how carbon monoxide is released and how heat transfer from the <b>flame</b> to the <b>plate</b> can be controlled using the electric field are the two main goals of this research. Multiple diagnostic techniques are employed such as OH chemiluminescence to identify the reaction zone, OH PLIF to characterize the location of this radical species, CO released from the flame, IR imaging and OH PLIF thermometry to understand the surface and gas temperature distribution, respectively. The principal finding is that carbon monoxide release from an impinging diffusion flame results from the escape of carbon monoxide created on the fuel side of the flame along the boundary layer near the surface where it avoids oxidation by OH, which sits to the air side of the reaction sheet interface. In addition, the plate proximity to the flame has a stronger influence on the emission of toxic carbon monoxide than does the electric field strength. There is, however, a narrow region of burner to surface distance where the electric field is most effective. The results also show that heat transfer can be spatially concentrated effectively using an electric field driven ion wind, particularly at some burner to surface distances...|$|R
40|$|Klason木質素顏色，微波加熱為深黑色而傳統加熱法則為棕色並不相同，究其原因為微波加熱直接對樣品本身加熱，而非加熱容器，如此將可很快使全部溶傳統Klason 法定量木材內木質素方法基於，在 15 - 20 ℃下以 72 % H 2 SO 4 膠化處理試樣 2 - 4 hrs，再經 3 % H 2 SO 4 煮沸 4 hrs小時後過濾，取殘渣量做為其定量依據。當我們用此方法測定時，需花費相當長的時間，一個樣品約需 8 - 10 hrs之久。本研究測定Klason木質素時，採微波加熱器之熱源，對台灣肖楠、相思樹、台灣杉及銀合歡於 3 % H 2 SO 4 階段溶液加熱，只需 10 - 20 min即可得到與傳統法加熱 4 hrs之相近似定量值。由掃描式電子顯微鏡圖觀察Klason 木質素粉末所得之微波處理者具較膨鬆之細胞壁及較低之密度(與傳統法相較) ，可知微波之高能量加熱法較傳統加熱法對細胞壁的作用更為劇烈。此外，由於高能量微波較傳統加熱對 3 % H 2 SO 4 溶液中之分子穿透力較高，故二者之氣相圖及紅外線光譜圖並不相同。不同加熱處理法定量出之液達沸騰溫度。利用元素分析二種方法所得木質素之C、H、O及S組成差異不大來看，知微波加熱效果與傳統加熱無異。 當然，吾人無意以微波加熱法取代現今慣用已久之TAPPI T 222 om- 98 Klason木質素定量方法；吾人所提供主要的方向，為節省時間之經濟考量。The {{classical}} {{method for}} the quantitative determination of wood lignin {{is based on}} Klason's technique involving hydrolysis with 72 % H 2 SO 4 for 2 - 4 hours at 15 - 20 0 C and then followed by condensing the dissolved lignin with 3 % H 2 SO 4 at boiling temperature for 4 hours. In this procedure lignin is left as an insoluble residue and is recovered by filtration and gravimetrically determined. While this method works satisfactorily for most woods, it requires modification to save the long testing time i. e., 8 - 10 hours for one test. Based on the similar klason-lignin contents, the use of microwave method, the decomposition of carbohydrates from Calocedrus formosana, Acacia confusa, Leucaena leucocephala and Taiwania cryptomerioides Hay with 3 % H 2 SO 4 can be accomplished in 10 - 20 minutes when compared with conventional methods using a <b>flame</b> or hot <b>plate</b> for 4 hours. By comparing the scanning electron micrographs and the densities of the klason lignin powders, there were more splittings outside the cell wall and lower density for the microwave treated samples due to its high energy {{than that of the}} conventional treated ones. In addition, the difference in infrared spectra and gas chromatographs of the two methods is due to the different mechanism by which energy is transferred to the molecules of the 3 % H 2 SO 4 solution. The color difference for the two Klason lignin samples, i. e., dark black for microwave treated one and brown for conventional one might be due to the microwave energy is directly transferred to all of the samples of the solution simultaneously without heating the vessel. Thus, boiling temperature is reached throughout the entire solution very quickly. However, no discernible differences in C, H, O, S contents between the two samples by elemental analysis can be found. Of course, we are not intended to replace the current Klason lignin determination method as specified in Tappi T 222 om- 98 with the microwave-aided method, our proposal will focus on the larger economic gains which result from significant savings in time. 第 1 章 緒論 [...] - 1 1. 1. 前言 [...] 1 1. 2. 文獻回顧 [...] 2 1. 2. 1. 木質素之構造 [...] 3 1. 2. 2. 微波加熱之能量傳導方式 [...] - 7 1. 2. 3. 微波加熱與傳統加熱法之比較 [...] - 10 第 2 章 實驗材料與方法 [...] 12 2. 1. 實驗材料 [...] 12 2. 2. 試驗方法 [...] - 13 2. 2. 1. 木質素之分離 [...] 13 2. 2. 2. 微波處理之應用 [...] 16 第 3 章 木質素之定量 [...] 18 3. 1. 醇苯抽出 [...] 18 3. 2. 傳統不溶於酸Klason 木質素定量法 [...] 19 3. 3. 傳統木質素定量法之第一階段膠化溫度對於 Klason 木質素定量之影響 [...] - 20 3. 4. 不同膠化時間對Klason 木質素定量之影響- 22 3. 5. 3 % H 2 SO 4 加熱時間對Klason 木質素定量之 影響 [...] - 24 3. 6. 微波加熱時間對Klason 木質素定量之影響- 26 3. 7. 傳統加熱法與微波加熱定量Klason木質素法 比較 [...] 28 第 4 章 定性分析 [...] 31 4. 1. 不同加熱處理法之Klason 木質素過濾液之紫 外光光譜吸收波圖 [...] 31 4. 2. 傳統加熱法和微波輔助加熱法定量 Klason木質素之元素分析 [...] 35 4. 3. 傳統加熱法與微波輔助加熱定量Klason 木質 素之外觀 [...] - 38 4. 4. 比較不同加熱處理木質素之顏色值 [...] 43 4. 5. 利用氣相色層分析術區別傳統及微波法定量 Klason木質素之異同 [...] - 45 4. 6. 利用紅外線吸收光譜區別傳統及微波定量 Klason木質素方法之異同 [...] - 48 第 5 章 結論 [...] - 50 參考文獻 附錄： TAPPI T 222 om- 98 木材及漿料中Klason 木質素之定量...|$|R
