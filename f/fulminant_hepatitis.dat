25|$|<b>Fulminant</b> <b>hepatitis,</b> or massive hepatic cell death, is a {{rare and}} {{life-threatening}} complication of acute hepatitis that can occur in cases of hepatitis B, D, and E, in addition to drug-induced and autoimmune hepatitis. The complication more frequently occurs in instances of hepatitis B and D co-infection {{at a rate of}} 2–20% and in pregnant women with hepatitis E at rate of 15–20% of cases. In addition to the signs of acute hepatitis, people can also demonstrate signs of coagulopathy (abnormal coagulation studies with easy bruising and bleeding) and encephalopathy (confusion, disorientation, and sleepiness). Mortality due to <b>fulminant</b> <b>hepatitis</b> is typically the result of various complications including cerebral edema, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, respiratory failure, or kidney failure.|$|E
25|$|Cases of drug-induced {{hepatotoxicity}} {{have been}} reported in the first month, but can occur at any time during treatment with diclofenac. Postmarketing surveillance has reported cases of severe hepatic reactions, including liver necrosis, jaundice, <b>fulminant</b> <b>hepatitis</b> with and without jaundice, and liver failure. Some of these reported cases resulted in fatalities or liver transplantation.|$|E

25|$|The {{hepatitis}} D virus causes chronic and <b>fulminant</b> <b>hepatitis</b> in {{the context}} of co-infection with the hepatitis B virus. It is primarily transmitted via non-sexual contact and via needles. Susceptibility to hepatitis D differs by geographic region. In the United States and Northern Europe, populations at risk are intravenous drug users and individuals who receive multiple transfusions. In the Mediterranean, hepatitis D is predominant among hepatitis B virus co-infected individuals.|$|E
25|$|Similar to Hepatitis A, {{hepatitis}} E manifests {{as large}} outbreaks and epidemics associated with fecal contamination of water sources. It {{accounts for more}} than 55,000 deaths annually with approximately 20 million people worldwide thought to be infected with the virus. It affects predominantly young adults, causing acute hepatitis. In infected pregnant women, Hepatitis E infection can lead to <b>fulminant</b> <b>hepatitis</b> with third trimester mortality rates as high as 30%. Individuals with weakened immune systems, such as organ transplant recipients, are also susceptible. Infection is rare in the United States but rates are high in the developing world (Africa, Asia, Central America, Middle East). Many genotypes exist and are differentially distributed around the world. There is some evidence of hepatitis E infection of animals, serving as a reservoir for human infection.|$|E
500|$|Acute [...] {{infection}} {{does not}} usually require treatment and most adults clear the infection spontaneously. Early antiviral treatment {{may be required}} in fewer than 1% of people, whose infection takes a very aggressive course (<b>fulminant</b> <b>hepatitis)</b> or who are immunocompromised. On the other hand, treatment of chronic infection {{may be necessary to}} reduce the risk of cirrhosis and liver cancer. Chronically infected individuals with persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, a marker of liver damage, and HBV DNA levels are candidates for therapy. Treatment lasts from six months to a year, depending on medication and genotype. Treatment duration when medication is taken by mouth, however, is more variable and usually longer than one year.|$|E

40|$|Histopathological {{findings}} of tropical acute liver {{diseases such as}} eclampsia, <b>fulminant</b> viral <b>hepatitis,</b> yellow fever, and aflatoxicosis are characteristic. In eclampsia, edema of liver tissue, sinusoidal dilatation and inflammatory exudate with Kupffer cell mobilization were seen. Liver cell cords were atrophic and showed irregular structures and pleomorphism of liver cell nuclei. Complicated and irregular pattern of degenerative or necrotic liver parenchyma in intermediate and outer zones of hepatic lobules were observed, while centrilobular areas were intact. <b>Fulminant</b> viral <b>hepatitis</b> showed irregular necrosis of liver parenchyma with inflammatory exudate and periportal bile duct proliferation. In contrast to other three diseases, lobular regenerative arrangements of remaining liver cell cords surrounded by necrotic or collapsed parenchyma were distinctive feature. Yellow fever showed zonal necrosis in intermediate zones of hepatic lobules. Centrilobular areas were relatively intact. Scattered acidophilic bodies of unicellular necrosis of liver cell were also seen in inconspicuous sinusoids. Inflammatory reaction of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was relatively slight. In aflatoxicosis, centrilobular necrotic changes of liver cells were prominent. Inflammatory exudate was slight.

40|$|Background. Infection with {{transfusion}} transmitted virus, a {{new member}} of the Parvoviridae family, {{has been found in}} patients both with chronic and <b>fulminant</b> post-transfusion cryptogenic <b>hepatitis.</b> Aim. To evaluate the prevalence and clinical Impact of transfusion transmitted virus infection In Italy. Patients and Methods. Studies were carried out on 256 patients and control subjects from three centres from Northern, Central and Southern Italy (92 nonA-nonC chronic hepatitis, 10 acute non <b>fulminant</b> cryptogenic <b>hepatitis,</b> 41 hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis and 113 blood donors). Serum transfusion transmitted virus was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction using two overlapping sets of primers. Results. A total of 52 of the 92 patients [54. 3 %] with chronic cryptogenic liver disease and 17 of the 41 hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis patients (41. 4 %) were transfusion transmitted virus-DNA positive. Transfusion transmitted virus co-infection in hepatitis C virus patients was not associated with either a higher severity of liver histology or higher alanine transaminase levels or signs of cholestasis. transfusion transmitted virus was found In 48 out of 113 (42. 4 %) blood donors. In the majority of samples, transfusion transmitted virus DNA was detected with only one of the two sets of primers used. Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis performed on 21 randomly selected viral isolates showed the presence of both type 1 and type 2 transfusion transmitted virus and allowed identification of two Isolates with high homology to genotype 6, described, so far mostly in Japan. Conclusions. Transfusion transmitted virus type I and 2 infection is common among blood donors and patients with liver disease in Italy. The pathogenic potential of transfusion transmitted virus type I and 2 In nonA-nonC hepatitis patients Is unlikely but further studies are needed to evaluate the epidemiological and clinical impact of other transfusion transmitted virus subtypes...|$|R

40|$|Viral {{infection}} is a common, life-threatening complication after allogeneic {{bone marrow transplantation}} (BMT), particularly {{in the presence of}} graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Using cytomegalovirus (CMV) as the prototypic pathogen, we have delineated the mechanisms responsible for the inability to mount protective antiviral responses in this setting. Although CMV infection was self-limiting after syngeneic BMT, in the presence of GVHD after allogeneic BMT, CMV induced a striking cytopathy resulting in universal mortality in conjunction with a <b>fulminant</b> necrotizing <b>hepatitis.</b> Critically, GVHD induced a profound dendritic cell (DC) defect that led to a failure in the generation of CMV-specific CD 8 (+) T-cell responses. This was accompanied by a defect in antiviral CD 8 (+) T cells. In combination, these defects dramatically limited antiviral T-cell responses. The transfer of virus-specific cells circumvented the DC defects and provided protective immunity, despite concurrent GVHD. These data demonstrate the importance of avoiding GVHD when reconstructing antiviral immunity after BMT, and highlight the mechanisms by which the adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells overcome the endogenous defects in priming invoked by GVHD...|$|R
