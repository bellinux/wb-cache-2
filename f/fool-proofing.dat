40|$|The {{issue of}} land {{intensification}} impacts on Below-Ground BioDiversity (BGBD) erosion is often addressed by linking soil micro-, meso- and macro-fauna quantity with land cover. However, {{it is also}} possible to adopt a deductive approach by drawing the geography and the dynamics of farming practices- related to Soil Organic Matter (SOM) management- with a direct bearing on BGBD. This integrative approach is based on an analysis of the socioeconomics of land cover, e. g. determinants of farming practices. It helps building scenarii on future evolution of soil fertility. This paper presents the outcomes of two fieldworks in the Taita Hills and their surrounding semi-arid plains, South-East Kenya. Small-scale farmers adopt various strategies to cope with increasing land scarcity. Some strategies are particularly outstanding, e. g. the intensification of the farming practices in the more humid highlands or the agrarian colonisation of the semi-arid foothills and lowlands. This study required a multidisciplinary and systemic approach. Based on an extensive data collection on a 52 square km area, in-depth interviews and <b>fool-proofing</b> process, involvin...|$|E
40|$|Many {{innovative}} designs {{only serve}} the needs of those who are rich and who already dominate a large share of resources. Few designs consider the needs of the deprived. The design team at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University conducted an applied research project in Nepal to design a new filter container (Filtainer) to {{serve the needs}} of the deprived. The project was conducted in collaboration with the research team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which had invented a filtration method for removing arsenic from water. The new container maintains the effective filtration of MIT’s original invention, while improving the degree of userfitness and minimizing the cost of production. This paper introduces the background, objectives, and research methods of the project. By presenting the research findings and illustrating the design, the paper emphasizes the importance of conducting in-depth research into users’ needs so that the design of products meets these needs and takes into account users’ daily practices. The paper presents the detailed design of the filter and discusses how it achieves a high degree of <b>fool-proofing</b> to provide clean and safe water for the deprived. School of Desig...|$|E
