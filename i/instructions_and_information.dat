UN Women, the agency designated to implement UN Gender Policy, however, continues to assert, including on its web site, that affirmative action for women remain in effect, {{and continues to be}} list it as applicable law. [...] The Secretary General has also affirmed to the general assembly, as noted above, that Gender A/I, remains in effect.

The number of publications related to user <b>instruction</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> literacy, like the field itself, show phenomenal growth during the past three decades as demonstrated by the fact that in 1973 twenty-eight publications were reviewed, and in 2002 more than 300 publications dealing with the topic of information literacywill be issued.

This paper presents an evaluation of supervised learning techniques applied to one such use case, namely that of labeling emotions, <b>instructions</b> <b>and</b> <b>information</b> in suicide notes. We train a collection of one-versus-all binary support vector machine classifiers, using cost-sensitive learning to deal with class imbalance. The features investigated range from simple bag-of-words and n-grams over stems, to information drawn from syntactic dependency analysis and WordNet synonym sets. The experimental results are complemented by an analysis of systematic errors in both the output of our system and the gold-standard annotations. ...|$|E

The G 400 PA expanded analysis simulates the dynamics of all conventional rotors, blade pendulum vibration absorbers, and the higher harmonic excitations resulting from prescribed vibratory hub motions and higher harmonic blade pitch control. The methodology for modeling the unsteady stalled airloads of two dimensional airfoils is discussed. Formulations for calculating the rotor impedance matrix appropriate to the higher harmonic blade excitations are outlined. This impedance matrix, and the associated vibratory hub loads, are the rotor dynamic characteristic elements {{for use in the}} simplified coupled rotor/fuselage vibration analysis (SIMVIB).
