40|$|Abstract. In most cases, {{recycled}} plastics include lots of impurities {{that can}} not be separated in operation steps of separation and washing. Normally, these impurities should be filtrated in extrusion process with filter plate and single or twin screw extruder. In extrusion process, it is easily for impurities to block the holes of filter plate. So how to improve the performance of self-cleaning can be regarded as a very important requirement for design of filter equipment. Based on FEM simulation, this paper discusses mechanism of filter plate’s blocking, the pressure distribution and deformation of two direct <b>flow</b> <b>filtrations.</b> Specially, a side stream filtration including how to clean itself has been introduced...|$|R

50|$|In {{chemical}} engineering, {{biochemical engineering}} and protein purification, crossflow filtration (also known as tangential <b>flow</b> <b>filtration)</b> {{is a type}} of filtration (a particular unit operation). Crossflow filtration is different from dead-end filtration in which the feed is passed through a membrane or bed, the solids being trapped in the filter and the filtrate being released at the other end. Cross-flow filtration gets its name because the majority of the feed flow travels tangentially {{across the surface of the}} filter, rather than into the filter. The principal advantage of this is that the filter cake (which can blind the filter) is substantially washed away during the filtration process, increasing the length of time that a filter unit can be operational. It can be a continuous process, unlike batch-wise dead-end filtration.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Data {{on blood}} <b>flow</b> regulation, renal <b>filtration,</b> and urine output in salt-sensitive Dahl S rats fed on high-salt (hypertensive) and low-salt (prehypertensive) diets and salt-resistant Dahl R rats fed on high-salt diets were {{analyzed}} using a mathematical model of renal blood <b>flow</b> regulation, glomerular <b>filtration,</b> and solute transport in a nephron. Results The mechanism of pressure-diuresis and pressure-natriuresis that emerges from simulation of the integrated systems is that relatively small increases in glomerular filtration that follow from increases in renal arterial pressure cause relatively large increases in urine and sodium output. Furthermore, analysis reveals the minimal differences between the experimental cases necessary to explain the observed data. It is determined that differences in renal afferent and efferent arterial resistances are able to explain all of the qualitative differences in observed <b>flows,</b> <b>filtration</b> rates, and glomerular pressure {{as well as the}} differences in the pressure-natriuresis and pressure-diuresis relationships in the three groups. The model is able to satisfactorily explain data from all three groups without varying parameters associated with glomerular filtration or solute transport in the nephron component of the model. Conclusions Thus the differences between the experimental groups are explained solely in terms of difference in blood flow regulation. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that, if a shift in the pressure-natriuresis relationship is the primary cause of elevated arterial pressure in the Dahl S rat, then alternation in how renal afferent and efferent arterial resistances are regulated represents the primary cause of chronic hypertension in the Dahl S rat. </p...|$|R

The city of Logan, Utah, proposes that the algae used from the 460 -acre wastewater pond could potentially {{be used for the}} production of biofuel that could serve as transportation fuel for the City solid waste vehicles. Separating the algae from the Logan Lagoon wastewater is the most expensive portion of the biodiesel process and the application of chemical flocculation can significantly increase costs and potentially interfere with biodiesel production. Cross <b>flow</b> <b>filtration</b> has been identified for algae harvesting, and experiments were conducted to evaluate materials and operating conditions for separating and harvesting algae from the Logan Lagoon system. Two cross flow filtrations units were used to conduct experiments. A pilot-scale cross <b>flow</b> <b>filtration</b> unit provided by WesTech, Inc., Engineering (Salt Lake City) with a 0. 2 -micron nylon membrane mesh was used for mixed-culture algae harvesting. In addition, a bench scale cross <b>flow</b> <b>filtration</b> unit was provided, and tests were conducted to further examine the effectiveness of cross <b>flow</b> <b>filtration</b> on pure-culture algae harvesting. A 1 -micron nylon, 5 -micron nylon and 5 -micron polyester mesh were used with this system. The WesTech, Inc., Pilot Scale System demonstrated that the type of membrane used was critical for effective algae harvesting. Test results showed that the algal cake that developed on the membrane and that the amount of algae harvested decreased with flux. The bench scale unit demonstrated that more algal cells were collected when a membrane of a larger pore size was used. The 1 -micron nylon mesh proved to be the most effective at concentration algae. The 5 -micron polyester mesh was shown to be more effective than the 5 -micron nylon mesh.
