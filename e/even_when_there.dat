5|$|Horses have an {{advanced}} sense of taste, which {{allows them to}} sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat, and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is adequate healthy food.|$|E
5|$|In {{most cases}} the {{electrons}} are close enough to thermal equilibrium that their temperature is relatively well-defined, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is a significant deviation from a Maxwellian energy distribution function, for example, due to UV radiation, energetic particles, or strong electric fields. Because of the large difference in mass, the electrons come to thermodynamic equilibrium amongst themselves much faster than they come into equilibrium with the ions or neutral atoms. For this reason, the ion temperature may {{be very different from}} (usually lower than) the electron temperature. This is especially common in weakly ionised technological plasmas, where the ions are often near the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may {{compete with}} striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may {{give way to}} hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's {{stronger}} jaws can easily tear open flesh that is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is no food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and hyenas may steal foxes from traps.|$|E

50|$|Five bus city lines, {{operated}} by Metrobus and Putco, {{pass through the}} airport twice a day. The buses are accessible {{in the morning and}} the <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> are many passengers departing and arriving. There are also private bus lines operating express buses to the CBD of Johannesburg, as well as other locations.|$|R
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge the morality of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the kakapo's {{breeding}} system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
5|$|Where spotted hyenas and lions {{occupy the}} same {{geographic}} area, {{the two species}} occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.|$|E
6000|$|McMurdo {{had laid}} down the paper, and was {{lighting}} his pipe with a hand which was shaky from {{the excesses of the}} previous <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was a knock outside, and his landlady brought to him a note which had just been handed in by a lad.

60|$|But it did {{not look}} as if the {{engagement}} was broken off. Not at any rate on this raw November <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was a dense fog outside, but a bright, cheery fire and plenty {{of light in the}} little sitting room at the Langham, and Luke sat on the sofa beside Louisa, and plain Louisa--in last autumn's gown--looking at him with her candid, luminous eyes.|$|R

50|$|California Tonalism was art {{movement}} {{that existed in}} California from circa 1890 to 1920. Tonalist are usually intimate works, painted with a limited palette. Tonalist paintings are softly expressive, suggestive rather than detailed, often depicting the landscape at twilight or <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is an absence of contrast. Tonalist paintings could also be figurative, but in them, the figure was usually out of doors or in an interior in a low-key setting with little detail.|$|R
60|$|He was busily {{engaged in}} this {{employment}} upon the Wednesday <b>evening</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was a tap {{at the door and}} Farintosh walked in, accompanied by Burt and Williams. Girdlestone glanced up at them, and greeted them briefly. He was not surprised at their visit, for they had come together several times before to report progress or make arrangements. Farintosh bowed as he entered the room, Burt nodded, and Williams rubbed his hands together and looked amiably bilious.|$|R

25|$|Noise: Amplifiers {{generate}} random voltage at {{the output}} <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is no signal applied. This can {{be due to}} thermal noise and flicker noise of the devices. For applications with high gain or high bandwidth, noise becomes a very important consideration.|$|E
25|$|From about 130BC onwards, Parthia {{suffered}} numerous incursions {{by various}} nomadic tribes, including the Sakas, the Yueh-chi, and the Massagetae. Each time, the Arsacid dynasts responded personally, doing so <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> were more severe threats from Seleucids or Romans looming {{on the western}} borders of their empire (as {{was the case for}} Mithridates I). Defending the empire against the nomads cost Phraates II and Artabanus I their lives.|$|E
5000|$|Music and {{entertainment}} was also provided at the Singing Theatre, where plays were performed by {{workers from the}} estate, and poetry recitals given. A band was provided on Sunday afternoons during summer. Thousands of Vauxhall lights, hanging glass lamps lit by candles, illuminated the gardens in the <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was open-air dancing. The night that Thomas Hardy danced with Pitt River's daughter Agnes in 1895 he described the gardens as [...] "Quite the prettiest sight I ever saw in my life".|$|R
60|$|Halborough assured Mrs. Fellmer that {{he would}} {{certainly}} bear the message; but as to her coming he was not so sure. The real truth was, however, that the matter would be decided by him, Rosa having an almost filial respect for his wishes.

50|$|Traditionally an oath (from Anglo-Saxon , {{also called}} plight) {{is either a}} {{statement}} of fact or a promise with wording relating to something considered sacred {{as a sign of}} verity. A common legal substitute for those who conscientiously object to making sacred oaths is to give an affirmation instead. Nowadays, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there's</b> no notion of sanctity involved, certain promises said out loud in ceremonial or juridical purpose are referred to as oaths. To swear is a verb used to describe the taking of an oath, to making a solemn vow.|$|R
25|$|When the {{surfaces}} are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes {{a very poor}} approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is no normal force, or a negative normal force). In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite {{the complexity of the}} fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.|$|E
25|$|One legend says that, {{during the}} Edo period, on it stood a pine tree which shook <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was no wind, {{producing}} an extremely pleasant {{sound as if}} a celestial creature was playing an instrument. According to another, {{the founder of the}} shrine, who was a Kamakura period samurai called Sasaki Moritsuna, saw the pine tree move very slightly and emit sounds like those of a koto, so he gave the cape its name.|$|E
25|$|The {{dynamics}} of New Brunswick politics {{are different from}} those of other Canadian provinces. The lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province. In addition, the presence of a large Francophone minority dictates that consensus politics is necessary, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is a majority government present. In this manner, {{the ebb and flow of}} New Brunswick provincial politics parallels the federal stage.|$|E

25|$|The US Army Field Manual advises against {{drinking}} urine for survival. These guides {{explain that}} drinking urine tends to worsen rather than relieve dehydration {{due to the}} salts in it, and that urine should not be consumed in a survival situation, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is no other fluid available. In hot weather survival situations where other sources of water are not available, soaking cloth (a shirt for example) in urine and putting it on the head can help cool the body.|$|E
25|$|Racial {{segregation}} is {{the separation}} of humans into socially-constructed racial groups in daily life. It may apply to activities such as eating in a restaurant, drinking from a water fountain, using a bath room, attending school, going to the movies, or in the rental or purchase of a home. Segregation is generally outlawed, but may exist through social norms, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is no strong individual preference for it, as suggested by Thomas Schelling's models of segregation and subsequent work.|$|E
25|$|The {{manner in}} which the bolas is swung differ between the three genera. Mastophora holds the bolas {{stationary}} with a front leg until a moth approaches, and then cocks the leg and swings the bolas towards the prey with a rapid pendulum-like stroke. Ordgarius begins to whirl the bolas rapidly when detecting an incoming moth. Cladomelea akermani whirls the bolas immediately after it is prepared for about 15 minutes, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> is no moth present. Ordgarius sometimes has smaller droplets above the terminal one, whereas the other genera produce only one terminal globule.|$|E
60|$|One <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was a {{dance and}} every one was busy down stairs, Jerry took {{a walk on the}} roof, and being sleepy, looked about for a cosey bed to take a nap in. Two {{brothers}} occupied one of these rooms, and both were Jerry's good friends, especially the younger. Georgie was fast asleep, as his dancing days had not yet begun, and Charlie was waltzing away down stairs; so Jerry crept into bed and nestled down beside his playmate, who was too sleepy to do anything but roll over, thinking the big brother had come to bed.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the release}} of the MHRC report, Matas accused MHRC vice-chairwoman Yvonne Peters of taking a {{contradictory}} position, stating that: [...] "So what they're saying is that a full investigation is warranted <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>there's</b> no evidence, as long as the accusation is within the jurisdiction of the board. There's a lot of problems with this. What basically happened is that Siddiqui heard a rumour. She makes a complaint, as a result of which the commission goes on a five-year fishing expedition. They don't find anything. We're co-operating with them. And then they dismiss the complaint. That's not a proper procedure, in my view." ...|$|R
60|$|Late in the <b>evening,</b> <b>when</b> <b>there</b> was {{a chance}} of finding the street deserted, she ran {{out as far as}} the presbytery.

Elsa had tied one of her mother's dark-coloured {{handkerchiefs}} over her head and put her darkest-coloured petticoat on the top of all the others. She had also wrapped her mother's dark shawl round her shoulders, and thus muffled up she was able to flit unperceived down the street, a swift little dark figure undistinguishable from the surrounding darkness of the night.|$|R
