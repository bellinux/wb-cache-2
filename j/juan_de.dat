5|$|Apolinario de la Cruz {{was born}} on July 22, 1815 in Barrio Pandác {{in the town of}} Lucban in Tayabas {{province}} (now Quezon Province) back when the Philippines was a colony of the Spanish Empire. His parents—Pablo de la Cruz and Juana Andres—were peasants and devout Catholics. Dela Cruz was literate, but stated that he had no formal education. Despite that, it is very likely that he received primary religious instruction and attended the local public primary school in Lucban. In 1829, he decided to become a priest and tried to join the Order of Preachers in Manila. During those times, Roman Catholic religious orders barred indios (native people of the Philippines) from joining, thus de la Cruz's application was rejected for the sole reason of his race. He then decided to work as a donado (lay brother) at the San <b>Juan</b> <b>de</b> Dios Hospital where he was admitted to the Cofradía de San <b>Juan</b> <b>de</b> Dios, a brotherhood affiliated with the hospital and was open to indios. During this time, he improved his public speaking and studied the Bible along with other religious writings.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Peninsular War in 1808, San Martín was named adjutant of Francisco María Solano Ortiz de Rosas. Rosas, suspected of being an afrancesado, was killed by a popular uprising which overran the barracks and dragged his corpse in the streets. San Martín was appointed to the armies of Andalucía, and led a battalion of volunteers. In June 1808 his unit became incorporated into a guerrilla force led by <b>Juan</b> <b>de</b> la Cruz Mourgeón. He was nearly killed during the battle of Arjonilla, but was saved by Sergeant <b>Juan</b> <b>de</b> Dios. On 19 July 1808, Spanish and French forces engaged in the battle of Bailén, a Spanish victory that allowed the Army of Andalusia to attack and seize Madrid. For his actions during this battle, San Martín was awarded a gold medal, and his rank raised to lieutenant colonel. On 16 May 1811, he fought in the battle of Albuera under the command of general William Carr Beresford. By this time, the French armies held most of the Iberian Peninsula under their control, except for Cádiz.|$|E
