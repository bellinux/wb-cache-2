40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze and compare the {{attitude}} of managers to the market position <b>of</b> independent <b>companies</b> in comparison to the companies that are members <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> in Croatia. In addition, research included an analysis of their attitudes toward current and future internal market trends with respect to the number and the value of transactions conducted within Croatian <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies.</b> Methodology: Relevant secondary and primary dana was used in the research. In secondary research, relevant scientific and professional literature was analyzed. Primary research was done by using a questionnaire on an intentional sample of experts, including 127 managers working for <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> in Croatia. Findings: Two main hypotheses were tested: H 1 – The internal market <b>of</b> Croatian <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies,</b> measured by the number of transactions, will grow in the future; H 2 – The internal market <b>of</b> Croatian <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies,</b> measured by transaction value, will grow in the future. Both hypotheses were accepted. Implications: Research results imply a further strengthening of the financial and economic importance <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> in Croatia, and a weakening <b>of</b> the <b>companies</b> that are not members <b>of</b> such <b>groups.</b> This implies a tendency toward certain monopoly development in some economic sectors. The development and continuous growth of the internal market compels countries to implement control and regulatory practices with regard to the use of transfer pricing, a path Croatia will have to follow...|$|R

5|$|FutureSex/LoveSounds is {{the second}} studio album by American singer and {{songwriter}} Justin Timberlake. It was released on September 8, 2006 by Jive Records and its affiliated label of the Zomba <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>Companies.</b> During a two-year hiatus, Timberlake resolved his feelings on being unable to record any new material, and as he returned to record some new music, he began collaborating with his longtime record producer Timbaland, alongside the latter's colleague Danja. The album's contents were produced at Timbaland's Thomas Crown Studios. The album shares some lyrical themes with Timberlake's debut album Justified (2002), although FutureSex/LoveSounds has more diversity in music genres. It infuses R and pop with techno, funk, and elements of rock. The reprises and interludes interspersed on the album's tracks were created by the production team {{with the goal of}} channeling Timberlake's influences; including David Bowie and Prince.|$|E

In the early 1930s {{a series of}} board disagreements within Charles Churchill & Co led to Arthur Chamberlain resigning as chairman of that company. He remained chairman of The Churchill Machine Tool Co, and the {{two companies}} diverged. Charles Churchill & Co changed from a sales organisation to become a manufacturer. Thereafter, both companies manufactured machine tooling, and Charles Churchill & Co became a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies.</b> By the 1960s significant rationalisation took place in British manufacturing, with companies merging or being taken over {{in an attempt to}} achieve benefits from economies of scale and pooled resources. The Churchill Machine Tool Co was taken over by the Birmingham Small Arms Company, which merged with Alfred Herbert Ltd, with production moving to Coventry.

40|$|The {{accounting}} {{regulations are}} more and more interested in <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies.</b> In some cases, these regulations require for preparing the consolidated financial statements.

These are applied in the case <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> with a complex structure. Their goal is to elaborate the consolidated financial statements using a set of methods and empirical skills. In this article we synthetize and apply the consolidation techniques in the view of Romanian accounting regulations. The Romanian practice has revealed, especially, two techniques: one based on direct consolidation and another one based on multiple levels (phased consolidation). Therefore, this work regards only the technical side of consolidated accounting, accounting records being evaded. Furthermore, we focus only on the preparation of the consolidated balance sheet in the case <b>of</b> some hypothetical <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

This is a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> and interested parties which together have the overall responsibility for the scheme, including Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd, J.

It was sold to the New England Consortium in 1997. An initial planning application, including a new Sainsbury's supermarket, was rejected by the council in November 1997; the rejection was subsequently upheld on appeal in September 1998. URBED were then asked to develop a new master plan for the site. This design statement was published in July 2001, and was granted planning permission by Brighton & Hove City Council at the end of 2002. Construction work on the site began on 19 July 2004.|$|E

The Guney family embarked on a programme of building links with London's mosques to encourage new burials in the cemetery. Guney began a slow programme of clearing the overgrown sections of the cemetery and restoring significant memorials. The Guney family's efforts to attract new custom have been successful, {{to the extent that}} some of the lands sold off in the 1970s have now been repurchased by the cemetery. In June 1989 the cemetery was designated a Conservation Area, and was subsequently declared a Site of Special Scientific Interest. In 1992 the Brookwood Cemetery Society was formed to improve awareness of the cemetery; the Society holds open days, guided walks and other events, restores damaged memorials, and maintains and improves the signage within the cemetery.It is with these intentions that Woking Borough Council agreed at a Special Council Meeting on 24 November 2014 that it should secure the Cemetery by establishing Woking Necropolis and Mausoleum Limited, as a subsidiary within its Thameswey <b>Group</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies.</b>|$|E

Khoo immediately took keen interest in the military treatise and began to learn and apply Sun Tzu's teachings into his work. Throughout his professional career, Sun Tzu's Art of War was his indispensable guide. Khoo married Judy, a former Taiwanese singer in early 1982. In 1983, he moved to Kuala Lumpur as sales and marketing manager. When Asian sugar baron Robert Kuok was invited to turn around the ailing Multi-Purpose <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>companies</b> in 1987, Khoo joined them as administration manager at Magnum Corporation. In 1989, he left Magnum to head the personnel and administration department of Metroplex Holdings Berhad, where he later became the general manager within just four months, managing The Mall shopping complex. Khoo initiated a series of management and sales policies that enabled The Mall to secure the 'Best Shopping Mall' award {{for two years in}} a row. In the same year, he began writing his first best-seller; War at Work – Applying Sun Tzu's Art of War in Today's Business World, which was a collection of memoranda based on Sun Tzu's Art of War he wrote to his managers at The Mall.|$|E
