5|$|<b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> were {{discouraged}} from {{working outside the}} home prior to World War II, even more than other American women. During World War II, the broad changes {{in the role of}} women caused by a need for labor on the home front affected the role of <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women,</b> who worked as secretaries and nurses, helped build airplanes, made ammunition in factories, and worked in shipyards.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> are {{now more}} highly {{represented}} among enlisted women in the Marine Corps than the other services. <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> are reaching the top echelons of the Marine Corps both in the enlistment and officer ranks. On August 13, 2004, MGySgt. Abigail D. Olmos became the first female Master Gunnery Sergeant {{in the history of}} the Marine Corps. and on August 2, 2006, Brigadier General Angela Salinas, made history when she became the first Hispanic female to obtain a general rank in the Marines. To date servicewomen are still restricted from serving in the following positions: Infantry regiments, artillery battalions, all armored units, combat engineer battalions, reconnaissance units, riverine assault craft units, low altitude air defense units, and fleet anti-terrorism security teams. In Operation Iraqi Freedom female Marines have played a prominent role guarding checkpoints and searching Iraqi women and children. This in turn has exposed many of them to dangerous situations which in some cases could cost them their lives. Two Hispanic female Marines died in said conflict: Lance Corporal Juana Navarro, assigned to 9th Engineer Support Battalion, 3rd Marine Logistics Group, III Marine Expeditionary Force, and Corporal Ramona M. Valdez.|$|E

5|$|Prior to World War II, {{traditional}} Hispanic {{cultural values}} expected {{women to be}} homemakers, thus they rarely left the home to earn an income. As such, women were discouraged from joining the military. Only {{a small number of}} <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> joined the military before World War II. However, with the outbreak of World War II, cultural prohibitions began to change. With the creation of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC), predecessor of the Women's Army Corps (WAC), and the U.S. Navy Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES), women could attend to certain administrative duties left open by the men who were reassigned to combat zones. While most women who served in the military joined the WAACs, a smaller number of women served in the Naval Women's Reserve (the WAVES). One of the first <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> to serve in the USAAF was Staff Sergeant Eva Romero Jacques. Romero Jacques, who spoke Spanish and English and had three years of college spent two years in the Pacific Theater, 1944 in New Guinea and 1945 in the Philippines, as an administrative aide. She survived a plane disaster when the craft in which she was on crashed in the jungles of New Guinea.|$|E

25|$|The {{results of}} Arizona State University study were {{somewhat}} different from Pager’s study, {{but the main}} finding was expected: Incarceration decreased the chances of getting employed. For females submitting applications online and in-person, regardless of criminal history, white women received the most amount of callbacks, roughly 40%. <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> followed up with a 34% callback rate. Black women had the lowest rate at 27%. The effects of incarceration on female applicants in general were that females with a prison record {{were less likely to}} receive a callback compared to females without a prison record. The significant exceptions are white women applying in person and <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> with a community college degree applying online.|$|E

25|$|Immigrant {{status in}} the United States is a {{predictor}} for breastfeeding adherence. In particular, the Hispanic paradox {{plays a role in}} the high breastfeeding rates observed among Hispanic/Latina women in the United States. Breastfeeding initiation rates among this population are higher for less acculturated immigrants; <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> {{who have been in the}} United States for longer are less likely to breastfeed. This disparity does not depend on age, income level, or education level; more acculturated Hispanics are likely to cite the same reasons for bottle-feeding as native-born white women do. In many cases, the connection that <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> feel to their culture and its values can strongly influence their decision regarding breastfeeding.|$|E

25|$|Health {{differentials}} amongst races {{can also}} serve as determining factors for other facets of life, including income and marital status. AIDS-affected <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> hold smaller salaries than average women, are part of poorer families, {{and are more likely}} to head households.

25|$|In {{the aspect}} of childbirth, men are {{required}} to {{wait until after the}} mother has had birth and dressed in a decent manner to visit his wife and newborn child.

25|$|According to {{a report}} by the Congressional Research Service, {{decreased}} progressiveness in capital gains taxes was the largest contributor to the increase in overall income inequality in the US from 1996 to 2006.

25|$|Women {{make up a}} disproportionately {{large or}} rising share of {{converts}} to Islam in numerous Western countries. According to researchers based at Swansea University, of the approximately 100,000 people who entered the Muslim faith in the United Kingdom between 2001 and 2011, 75% were women. In the United States, more <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> convert to Islam than Hispanic men; the share of overall female converts to Islam in the US rose from 32% in 2000 to 41% in 2011. Young females constitute an estimated 80% of converts to Islam in Lithuania. According to Susanne Leuenberger of the Institute of Advanced Study in the Humanities and the Social Sciences at the University of Bern, females make up around 60-70% of conversions to Islam in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} {{of how a}} woman perceives her behavior should not be underestimated. Many women perceived sex as a chore {{as opposed to a}} pleasurable experience, and they tend to consider themselves sexually inadequate, which in turn does not motivate them to engage in sexual activity. Several factors influence a women's perception of her sexual life. These can include: race, her gender, ethnicity, educational background, socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, financial resources, culture, and religion. Cultural differences are also present in how women view menopause and its impact on health, self-image, and sexuality. A study has found that African American women are the most optimistic about menopausal life; Caucasian women are the most anxious, Asian women are the most inhibited about their symptoms, and <b>Hispanic</b> <b>women</b> are the most stoic.|$|E
