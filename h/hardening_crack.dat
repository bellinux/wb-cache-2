40|$|AbstractA fibrous {{composite}} beam {{with an edge}} crack is submitted to a cyclic bending moment and the crack bridging actions due to the fibers. Assuming a general elastic-linearly <b>hardening</b> <b>crack</b> bridging model for the fibers and a linear-elastic law for the matrix, the statically indeterminate bridging actions are obtained from compatibility conditions. The elastic and plastic shake-down phenomena are examined in terms of generalised cross-sectional quantities and, by employing a fatigue crack growth law, the mechanical behaviour up to failure is captured. Within {{the framework of the}} proposed fracture mechanics-based model, the cyclic crack bridging due to debonding at fiber–matrix interface of short fibers is analysed in depth. By means of some simplifying assumptions, such a phenomenon can be described by a linear isotropic tensile softening/compressive hardening law. Finally, numerical examples are presented for fibrous {{composite beam}}s with randomly distributed short fibers...|$|E

Different approaches utilizing the second term T-stress of the linear-elastic crack tip stress field, a higher term A(2) of the power-law <b>hardening</b> <b>crack</b> tip stress field, a hydrostatic correction term Q for a reference stress field or the local triaxiality parameter h are compared. Experimental results for a pressure vessel steel 22 Ni-MoCr 3 - 7 are investigated by means of the different approaches regarding their capability of constraint characterization for enhanced transferability.

40|$|Object of {{the paper}} is the {{simulation}} of reinforced concrete bars behaviour, accounting for crack opening and concrete-rebar slippage. A macro beam element with a single uniform reinforcement is studied in details in the uniaxial case. Distinct constitutive hypotheses are formulated for the materials. The CEB-FIP Model Code 90 rules the behaviour of the materials interface that is assumed to be fully dissipative. Steel is supposed to behave elastoplastically with <b>hardening.</b> <b>Crack</b> opening in the concrete matrix is introduced by means of a strong discontinuity approach (SDA). All the relevant equations of the problem are variationally derived from a mixed energy functional. Two enhancements of the enriched kinematics, based on polynomial or exponential shape functions, respectively, are compared with the usual SDA enhancement. As an alternative approach, high-order interpolation of the displacement field based on B-splines, both for steel and concrete, is proposed. These functions appear to be adequate in reproducing rapidly varying fields, like the stress gradients occurring in the shear lag problem near the boundaries or where slips and/or cracks occur. Their use allow to use few macro-element instead of the very dense meshing required in those areas by the traditional FE interpolations...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{the use of a}} laser-beam, in order to carburize the surface of DIN 15 CrNi 6 low-alloy, case-hardening steel. The surface of the material was coated with graphite prior to laser irradiation. Two different kinds of coatings were used: (i) a dilute commercial graphite spray; and (ii) a slurry of graphite powder in ethanol. A CO, laser-beam was used as the heat source, in order to activate the introduction of carbon in the steel surface. Carburizing was achieved by two distinct mechanisms: (a) the surface alloying mechanism, which incorporates melting of the substrate and dissolution of the graphite in the liquid phase; and (b) the solid-state diffusion mechanism, which incorporates austenitization of the substrate and carbon diffusion in austenite. A variety of microstructures and microhardness profiles were produced, depending mainly on the type of graphite coating used, as well as on processing parameters. In general, the carburized layer was accompanied by a heat-affected zone, which was also significantly hardened, mainly due to secondary <b>hardening.</b> <b>Cracking</b> and porosity was observed in some specimens carburized by the surface alloying mechanism, as a result of carbon enrichment and high solidification rates. Finally, an effort was made to investigate the possibility for solid-state diffusion of carbon in austenite, under the short heating times imposed by laser treatment, with the use of computational kinetics simulation.

40|$|The {{fatigue crack}} growth {{behavior}} under constant amplitude and under single overload of 2024 aluminum alloy in {{sheet and plate}} product form has been investigated. Constant amplitude fatigue crack growth tests showed superior crack growth resistance of the plate attributed to a pronounced roughness induced crack closure {{as a result of}} the coarse and elongated grain structure. Crack growth tests with single overload showed that the retardation effect caused by the overload is not primarily influenced by roughness crack closure at the crack path. In this case, the sheet material with lower yield strength revealed a higher retardation effect than the plate material. The observed crack growth behavior has been simulated with the LTSM-F model, which accounts for retardation of crack growth after an overload due to material strain <b>hardening</b> at the <b>crack</b> front.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{hydrogen}} on the mechanical behaviour is twofold: It affects the local yield stress and it accelerates material damage.

This requires a coupled model of deformation, damage and diffusion. The deformation behaviour is described by von Mises plasticity with pure isotropic <b>hardening,</b> and <b>crack</b> extension is simulated by a cohesive zone model.

In this study, two types of fibers namely steel (ST) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibres are used in mono as well as in ST-PVA hybrid form, with a total volume fraction of 2 %. The deflection hardening behaviour of newly developed DFRGC is also compared with that of conventional ductile fibre reinforced cementitious composites (DFRCC). The effects of two different sizes of sand (1. 18 mm, and 0. 6 mm) and sand/binder ratios of 0. 5 and 0. 75 on the deflection <b>hardening</b> and multiple <b>cracking</b> behaviour of both DFRGC and DFRCC are also evaluated. Results revel that the deflection <b>hardening</b> and multiple <b>cracking</b> behaviour is achieved in geopolymer based DFRGC similar to that of cement based system. For a given sand size and sand content, comparable deflection hardening behaviour, ultimate flexural strength and the deflection at peak load are observed in both cement and geo-polymer based composites irrespective of fibre types and combination. The deflection hardening behaviour of DFRGC is also confirmed by the calculated toughness index values of I 20 > 20. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) study shows no degradation of PVA and steel fibres in the geopolymer matrix. However, the bond of PVA fibre with geopolymer matrix is found to be higher than that with cement matrix as evidenced in the SEM pictures. An opposite trend is observed with steel fibre. The proposed development exhibit a significant benefit for the use of geopolymer based DFRGC over cement based system as the former one is green in terms of no cement use...|$|R
