500|$|According to Antony Polonsky, General Stefan Grot-Rowecki, the Home Army's commander, made {{it clear}} in an order of 10 November 1942 that the Home Army did not regard the Jews as [...] "part of our nation", and that action {{was not to be}} taken to defend them if it {{endangered}} other Home Army objectives. Joshua D. Zimmerman disputes such a description of Rowecki, noting {{that he was willing to}} provide the Jews with aid and resources when it contributed to the greater war effort, but that he had concluded that providing large supplies of arms to the Jews would be ineffectual. Zimmerman writes that Rowecki was [...] "clearly sympathetic to the Jews and eager to help", and that his reasoning was the norm among the Western Allies, whose reaction to news of the Holocaust was that only regular military action against Nazi Germany could halt it. Zimmerman further writes that, while Polonsky was right that at that time Rowecki did not see the Jews as part of the Polish nation, and that his support for them was limited, his (and the Home Army's) attitude would shift substantially <b>in</b> <b>coming</b> <b>months</b> as the brutal reality of the Holocaust became more apparent, and Polish public opinion's support for the Jewish resistance would increase.|$|E
