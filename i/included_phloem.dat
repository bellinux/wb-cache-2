The principal salivary gland is multilobed whereas the accessory gland is tubular. 1 -D electrophoresis revealed proteins of approximately 58 and 64 kDa in the salivary gland extracts and proteins of similar molecular weights in the extracted plant exudates, <b>including</b> <b>phloem,</b> from infested leaves and tender shoots of E. globulus. Proteins that could fall within this range include, but are not limited to, glucosemethanol- choline-oxidoreductase (53 - 66 kDa), Zn-binding dehydrogenase (67 kDa) and esterase (65 - 96 kDa), in addition to cytochrome P- 450 (50 - 55 kDa), trehalase (56 kDa), amylase (50 - 75 kDa) and lipase (48 - 52 kDa). Previous studies indicate that glucose-methanol-cholineoxidoreductase, Zn-binding dehydrogenase, cytochrome P- 450 and trehalase suppress plantdefence mechanisms, whereas the cell-degrading enzymes such as amylase, lipase and esterase have a possible role in enabling C. eucalypti to insert its stylet into leaf and shoot tissues of E. globulus...|$|R
30|$|In {{the mature}} leaves of 1 -month-old plants, OsAP 77 ::GUS was {{expressed}} in the vascular tissues, but not in other tissues (Additional file 3 B), {{which is why it}} was under the detection level by northern blot analysis, but was expressed 10 -folds higher by microarray analysis after PBZ treatment (Shimono et al. [2003]). In the roots, OsAP 77 ::GUS expression was restricted to the vascular tissues of the primary and lateral roots (maturation zone). The plant vascular system <b>includes</b> <b>phloem</b> tissues that transport organic materials and xylem cells that transport water and soil derived nutrients. The detection of cis-elements of promoters distinct for vascular tissues may provide a functional approach to illuminate these mechanisms (Yin et al. [1997]). The GATA motifs, ASL box (GCATC) and box-II (CCCCT) are present in many promoter regions and described as vascular tissue-specific elements (Yin et al. [1997]; Hatton et al. [1995]). These cis-acting regulatory elements responding to vascular tissue specific expression (VTREs) were also found in the 5 ′-flanking region of OsAP 77.

These transformed cells acquire distinct transfer cell features, such as cell wall ingrowths and an elongated shape. In addition, they express a number of MRP- 1 target genes presumably involved in defense. We also show that the expression of MRP- 1 is needed to maintain the transfer cell phenotype. Later in development, an observed reduction in the ectopic expression of MRP- 1 was followed by the reversion of the transformed cells, which then acquire aleurone cell features...|$|R

40|$|The Russian {{wheat aphid}} (RWA, (Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko) and the Bird cherry-oat aphid (BCA, (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) cause severe damage to grain crops, {{including}} barley. An {{investigation of the}} effects of these aphids on a susceptible cultivar revealed that BCA-infested barley plants remained healthy-looking for two weeks after feeding commenced. In contrast, signs of stress and damage, including chlorosis and leaf necrosis were evident in RWA infested plants. Our study suggests that damage to the vascular tissue due to sustained feeding by BCA, was not as extensive as that caused by RWA. In addition, there is a marked difference in the salivary secretion pattern within xylem elements punctured by aphids tapping the xylem for water. RWA deposit electron-dense, amorphous to smooth saliva, which completely encases the inner walls of affected elements, and saliva encases pit membranes between xylem elements, and between xylem vessels and xylem parenchyma. Xylem tapped by BCA, contained more granular saliva, which apparently does not occlude vessel wall apertures or the pit membranes to the same extent as was observed with RWA. Damage to <b>phloem</b> tissue, <b>including</b> <b>phloem</b> parenchyma elements, sieve tube-companion cell (CC-ST) complexes as well as thick-walled sieve tubes, was extensive. Plasmodesmata between phloem parenchyma elements as well as pore-plasmodesmata between the CC-ST were occluded by callose.

In woody vines, certain {{segments of the}} interfascicular cambium produce secondary parenchyma whereas a fascicular cambium produces typical proportions of xylem and phloem, as in Aristolochia (Aristolochiaceae) (Beck 2011). The xylem is furrowed by arcs or wedges of phloem derived from portions of the cambium that produce less xylem and more phloem (Angyalossy et al. 2015). However, furrowed xylem may develop from phloem wedges or secondary parenchyma proliferation. Carlquist (1991) defined rays as having very wide, thin-walled cells with limited subdivision during secondary growth. Wide rays develop in Piperaceae, and during secondary growth, the rays do not subdivide very much. Indeed, there may be little difference between them. Wider rays in lianas allow the stems to experience torsion without sustaining damage to vessels and contribute to liana stem flexibility (Putz and Holbrook 1991). The functional significance of wider rays in these seven Piper species needs to be checked.|$|E

In another experiment, confocal {{laser scanning microscopy}} was used to visualize the penetration into, and the subsequent cellular distribution of, an nC 24 agricultural mineral oil in C. trifoliata L. seedlings. Oil droplets penetrated or diffused into plants via both stomata and the cuticle of leaves and stems, and then moved within intercellular spaces and into various cells <b>including</b> <b>phloem</b> and xylem.

We also determine the cardinal and vertical (within-tree) and horizontal (between-tree) spatial distribution of borers. Fewer than 10 % of P. solida attacks were recorded from the pure species (Corymbia citriodora subsp. variegate (Hook)), and this taxon also showed the highest survival, phloem thickness, relative growth rate, and bark:wood area. For the two most susceptible taxa, borer severity was negatively correlated with moisture content, and positively related to phloem density. Borers were nonrandomly and nonuniformly distributed within trees, and were statistically aggregated in 32 % of plots. More attacks were situated on the northern side of the tree than the other aspects, and most larvae fed within the lower 50 cm of the bole, with attack height positively correlated with severity. Trees with borers had more dead neighbors, and more bored neighbors, than trees without borers, while within plots, borer incidence and severity were positively correlated. Because the more susceptible taxa overlapped with less susceptible taxa for several physical tree factors, the role of primary and secondary chemistries in determining host suitability needs to be investigated. Nevertheless, taxon, moisture content, phloem density, tree size, and mortality of neighboring trees appeared the most important physical characteristics influencing host suitability for P. solida at this site...|$|R

The wood anatomy of the neotropical part of this pantropical family supports the subdivision into two groups: the subfamily Memecyloideae (the genus Mouriri) and the subfamily Melastomatoideae (all other genera). A relationship of Mouriri with other representatives of the family is {{not supported by the}} wood anatomical characters, because of differences in fibre type, vessel distribution, and the fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the presence of <b>included</b> <b>phloem</b> in Mouriri. The subfamily Melastomatoideae is a fairly homogeneous group. Although some characters are very pronounced in some tribes and scarce or absent in other tribes, most tribes show a wide overlap in their wood anatomical features.

40|$|Cambial {{variants}} {{represent a}} form of secondary growth that creates great stem anatomical diversity in lianas. Despite the importance of cambial variants, nothing {{is known about the}} developmental mechanisms that may have led to the current diversity seen in these stems. Here, a thorough anatomical analysis of all genera along the phylogeny of Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) was carried out in order to detect when in their ontogeny and phylogeny there were shifts leading to different stem anatomical patterns. We found that all species depart from a common developmental basis, with a continuous, regularly growing cambium. Initial development is then followed by the modification of four equidistant portions of the cambium that reduce the production of xylem and increase the production of phloem, the former with much larger sieve tubes and an extended lifespan. In most species, the formerly continuous cambium becomes disjunct, with cambial portions within phloem wedges and cambial portions between them. Other anatomical modifications such as the formation of multiples of four phloem wedges, multiple-dissected phloem wedges, and <b>included</b> <b>phloem</b> wedges take place thereafter. The fact that each novel trait raised on the ontogenetic trajectory appeared in subsequently more recent ancestors on the phylogeny suggests a recapitulatory history. This recapitulation is, however, caused by the terminal addition of evolutionary novelties rather than a truly heterochronic process. Truly heterochronic processes were only found in shrubby species, which resemble juveniles of their ancestors, {{as a result of a}} decelerated phloem formation by the variant cambia. In addition, the modular evolution of phloem and xylem in Bignonieae seems to indicate that stem anatomical modifications in this group occurred at the level of cambial initials.

40|$|The wood {{anatomy of}} the palaeotropical Melastomataceae is {{described}} in detail {{on the basis of}} 134 samples of 107 species from 36 genera. On the wood anatomy, three subfamilies are recognized, Memecyloideae, Melastomatoideae, and Crypteronioideae. The Memecyloideae stand out through their fibre-tracheids, the deviating fibre length/vessel member length ratio, and the scanty paratracheal to aliform parenchyma. The Melastomatoideae are characterised by libriform fibres showing fibre dimorphism and rays composed of erect, square, and weakly procumbent cells (also in Memecyloideae p. p.). The subfamily Astronioideae is abolished; Pternandra is transferred to Memecyloideae, the Astronieae fit perfectly in the Melastomatoideae. Within Melastomatoideae the tribes are not easy to separate. The subtribe Dissochaetineae (all climbers) of the Dissochaeteae stands out because of its multiseriate rays, subtribe Medinillineae has scalariform inter-vessel pits; Astronieae have longest vessel members of the palaeotropical Melastomataceae, uniseriate rays, and bands of deviating fibres in which axial parenchyma is scarcely present: in the Osbeckieae apotracheal parenchyma bands (probably originated through fibre dimorphism) characterise the wood of Dichaetanthera; it is proposed to combine Oxysporeae and Sonerileae to one tribe Sonerileae; {{on the basis of the}} inter-vessel pitting two subtribes are recognized, different in delimitation from the two original tribes. The family Crypteroniaceae s. s. (Axinandra, Crypteronia and Dactylocladus) is incorporated in Melastomataceae as a separate subfamily. The scalariform inter-vessel pits, present in palaeotropical Melastomataceae only, must be interpreted as a specialization from the alternate pattern. Raphides are present in one species of Bredia, B. tuberculata. Clustered crystals are observed in the axial parenchyma and rays of Dichaetanthera. Large elongate crystals are present in the parenchyma of the strands of axially <b>included</b> <b>phloem</b> of the Memecyloideae. Variation in quantitative characters (vessel member length, vessel diameter and frequency) can partly be explained from the ecological preference of the species concerned. Wood anatomical differences between lianas and erect relatives are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} to explain the phloem mobility of certain systemic xenobiotics that are not weak acids. It is shown {{that there is a}} theoretically optimum permeability that permits optimum circulation through the symplasm and apoplast (<b>including</b> the <b>phloem</b> and xylem) of Solanum tuberosum plants. The optimum permeability is large enough to permit substantial passive permeation into sieve cells in the source leaf and yet is small enough to permit phloem transport with some retention. The optimum permeability {{is a function of the}} velocity of sap flow in sieve tubes, the radius of the sieve tube, the over-all length of the plant, and the length of the carbohydrate and xenobiotic sources. It is argued that the nematicide, oxamyl, is near the optimum permeability under some experimental conditions. It is shown that depending on the strength of the carbohydrate sink in roots or growth points and depending on the permeability of the xenobiotic, there can be passive accumulation of xenobiotics in the sieve tubes in the carbohydrate sink regions...|$|R
2500|$|In {{plants with}} {{secondary}} growth, the vascular cambium, originating between the xylem and the phloem, forms a cylinder of tissue along the stem and root.

40|$|Abstract The phloem is an {{important}} conduit for the transport of signaling molecules <b>including</b> RNA. <b>Phloem</b> sap {{has served as a}} source of RNA to proWle uncontami-nated phloem transcriptomes but its collection is diYcult in many species. Laser capture microdissection techniques oVer a valuable alternative for isolating RNA from speciWc vascular cells. In potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), there are seven BEL 1 -like transcription factors expressed throughout the plant with diverse functions. The RNA of one of these, StBEL 5, moves through the phloem from the leaf to stolon tips to regulate tuber formation. In this study, the presence of several BEL RNAs and one Knotted 1 -like RNA was determined in phloem cells collected by laser microdissec-tion coupled to laser pressure catapulting (LMPC). Three Wxatives were compared for their eVect on cell morphology and RNA quality in transverse sections of stems of potato. For optimum tissue integrity and quality of RNA from potato stem sections, the best results were achieved using ethanol acetate as the Wxative. In addition, the RT-PCR results demonstrated the presence of six out of seven of the StBEL RNAs and a potato Knox RNA in phloem cells...|$|R
40|$|Chemical elicitors and {{mechanical}} treatments simulating real insect herbivory have been increasingly {{used to study}} induced defensive responses in woody plants. However, simultaneous quantitative comparisons of plant chemical defences elicited by real and simulated herbivory have received little attention. In this paper we compared the effects of real herbivory, simulated herbivory using two chemical elicitors, {{and mechanical}} damage treatments on the quantitative secondary chemistry of Pinus pinaster juveniles (namely on non-volatile resin in the stem and total phenolics in the needles). The real herbivory involved phloem wounding by Hylobius abietis and defoliation by Brachyderes lusitanicus (two pine weevils); the chemical elicitors to simulate herbivory induction were 40 mM methyl jasmonate (MJ) and 20 μM benzothiadiazole (BTH); and the mechanical treatments <b>included</b> <b>phloem</b> wounding and needle clipping. We also performed an additional experiment for assessing at what extent insect extracts could increase plant responses over mechanical damage. Chemical induction with MJ, mechanical wounding and real phloem herbivory by H. abietis all produced quantitatively similar results, increasing the concentration of resin in the stem and total phenolics in the needles by equivalent magnitudes. Exogenous application of BTH increased the concentration of phenolic compounds in pine needles, but did not show {{the same effect on}} stem resin. Contrastingly, we did not find significant changes in the concentration of resin in the stem or phenolics in the needles after needle clipping and B. lusitanicus feeding. Mechanical damage followed by the application of extracts from the insects B. lusitanicus and H. abietis on the injured tissues did not increase the responses in comparison to mechanical damage alone. The fact that strong induced responses elicited by phloem wounding insects are equally elicited by phloem injuries suggests that defences in pine trees are raised with low specificity regarding biotic enemies. Results from this paper support future methodological approaches using chemical elicitors and mechanical damage as simulated herbivory treatments for the experimental induction of conifer defences. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|Heat {{girdling}} is {{a method}} to estimate the relative contribution of phloem vs xylem water flow to fruit growth. The heat girdling process is assumed to destroy all living tissues, <b>including</b> the <b>phloem,</b> without affecting xylem conductivity. However, to date, the assumption that xylem is not affected by heat girdling remains unproven. * In this study, we used in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) velocimetry to test if heat girdling can cause xylem vessels to embolize or affect xylem water flow characteristics in the peduncle of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv Dirk). * Anatomical and MRI data indicated that, {{at the site of}} girdling, all living tissues were disrupted, but that the functionality of the xylem remained unchanged. MRI velocimetry showed that the volume flow through the secondary xylem was not impeded by heat girdling in either the short or the long term (up to 91  h after girdling). * This study provides support for the hypothesis that in the tomato peduncle the integrity and functionality of the xylem remain unaffected by heat girdling. It therefore confirms the validity of the heat girdling technique as a means to estimate relative contributions of xylem and phloem water flow to fruit growth...|$|R
30|$|Fe {{transport}} from root {{to shoot}} and grain {{is essential for}} normal plant growth. In rice, Fe can be transported in various forms through the xylem and <b>phloem,</b> <b>including</b> Fe-citrate, DMA–Fe(III), and NA–Fe(II). The knockout of the rice citrate transporter osfrdl 1 results in chlorotic plants {{with low levels of}} Fe in the leaves and Fe precipitation in the root stele. Such mutants also show a reduced concentration of citrate and ferric iron in the xylem sap compared to WT rice. OsFRDL 1 expression was first identified in cells involved in long-distance transport as well as in reproductive organs, and, unlike other Fe transporters, OsFRDL 1 expression is not regulated by Fe availability (Inoue et al. 2004). These results suggest a role for OsFRDL 1 in Fe homeostasis through the xylem.|$|R
40|$|Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass {{spectrometry}} (MALDI-MS) {{was developed for}} spatial profiling of phytochemicals and secondary metabolites in integrated herbal tissue without solvent extraction. Abundant alkaloid ions, including (+) -menisperine (m/z 356), magnoflorine (m/z 342), stepharanine (m/z 324), protonated sinomenine (m/z 330), protonated sinomendine (m/z 338), and a metabolite at m/z 314, could be directly desorbed from α-cyano- 4 - hydroxycinnamic acid- (CHCA-) coated stem tissue of Sinomenium acutum upon N 2 laser (337 nm) ablation, while the ion signals desorbed from sinapinic acid- (SA-) coated and 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid- (DHB-) coated stem tissue were at least 10 times weaker. Solvent composition in the matrix solution could have significant effects on the ion intensity of the metabolites. Under optimized conditions that maximize the ion intensity and form homogeneous matrix crystals on the tissue surface, spatial distributions of the metabolites localized in different tissue regions, <b>including</b> cortex, <b>phloem,</b> xylem, rim, and pith, and their relative abundances could be semiquantitatively determined. The three metabolites detected at m/z 356, 342, and 314 showed specific distributions in the herbal samples collected from different growing areas, while others were not. By applying principal component analysis (PCA), the characteristic metabolites in specific tissue regions could be easily determined, allowing unambiguous differentiation of the herbal samples from different geographic locations. © 2007 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|Higuchi et al. (2001 a) {{produced}} {{transgenic rice}} expressing HvNAS 1 {{under the control}} of the cauliflower mosaic virus constitutive CaMV 35 S promoter. NA concentration in plant shoot increased 3 -fold in this transgenic rice. Based on these results, we hypothesized that enhancing the expression of NAS could increase the NA concentration within the plant body and, as a consequence, increase the Fe concentration in seeds. Therefore, we produced transgenic rice overexpressing HvNAS 1 {{under the control of}} the OsActin 1 promoter or 35 S promoter (Masuda et al. 2009). HvNAS 1 -overexpressing transgenic rice showed increased HvNAS 1 expression and increased endogenous NA levels in the shoots and seeds by 5 to 10 -fold (Masuda et al. 2009). The Fe and Zn concentrations in the T 1 polished seeds from the transgenic plants increased more than 3 -fold and 2 -fold, respectively. The Fe concentrations also increased 2 -fold in the T 2 polished seeds (Table  1). Lee et al. (2009 c) and Johnson et al. (2011) showed that NAS overexpression increased the Fe concentration in polished rice seeds by 3 – 4 -fold (Table  1). Thus, Fe transport within the plant body, <b>including</b> the <b>phloem,</b> may be improved by NAS overexpression (Masuda et al. 2009; Lee et al. 2009 c; Johnson et al. 2011). Moreover, Lee et al. (2009 c) reported that Fe-biofortified rice overexpressing OsNAS 3 by virtue of an enhancer tag mitigated Fe-deficiency anemia in mice to a greater degree than non-transgenic rice seeds.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) are a {{class of}} small, non-coding RNAs that play an {{important}} role in development and environmental responses. Hundreds of plant miRNAs have been identified to date, mainly from the model species for which there are available genome sequences. The current challenge is to characterise miRNAs from plant species with agricultural and horticultural importance, to aid our understanding of important regulatory mechanisms in crop species and enable improvement of crops and rootstocks. Results Based on the knowledge that many miRNAs occur in large gene families and are highly conserved among distantly related species, we analysed expression of twenty-one miRNA sequences in different tissues of apple (Malus x domestica 'Royal Gala'). We identified eighteen sequences that are expressed in at least one of the tissues tested. Some, but not all, miRNAs expressed in apple tissues <b>including</b> the <b>phloem</b> tissue were also detected in the phloem sap sample derived from the stylets of woolly apple aphids. Most of the miRNAs detected in apple phloem sap were also abundant in the phloem sap of herbaceous species. Potential targets for apple miRNAs were identified that encode putative proteins shown to be targets of corresponding miRNAs in a number of plant species. Expression patterns of potential targets were analysed and correlated with expression of corresponding miRNAs. Conclusions This study validated tissue-specific expression of apple miRNAs that target genes responsible for plant growth, development, and stress response. A subset of characterised miRNAs was also present in the apple phloem translocation stream. A comparative analysis of phloem miRNAs in herbaceous species and woody perennials will aid our understanding of non-cell autonomous roles of miRNAs in plants. </p...|$|R
