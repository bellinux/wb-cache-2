30|$|HPC-forest {{is one of}} {{the last}} {{rainforest}} remnants below ~ 350  m a.s.l. in Thừa Thiên-Huế Province. Tree species assemblages in this hillside forest were transient between lowland and colline/sub-montane rainforest. As this fragment was connected to a much larger forest only a few years ago, few signs of fragmentation-induced plant community degradation were as yet evident, but rare species (and a few common species) were already disproportionately under-represented by seedlings. Furthermore, on-going extraction of certain types of timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs, especially rattan) by villagers probably explained the rarity/absence of certain commercially important species. The decreasing value of the forest for villagers (due to resource over-uses and changing economic activities/livelihoods) currently coincides with a boom in <b>industrial</b> <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry.</b> This caused the forest fragment to contract by half its size in between 2010 and 2015. One may expect that HPC-forest will be replaced entirely by plantations within coming years, but it may not yet be too late to safeguard parts of a larger fragment located nearby to the north.|$|E

Despite many publications documenting benefits demonstrated in research studies, and despite continuing calls {{from a wide}} range of advocates for mixed-species plantations, polyculture remains the exception rather than the rule in <b>industrial</b> <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry.</b> The following observations are drawn from a recent workshop: - innovative experiment designs and analytical techniques are available to examine species interactions; - despite the enthusiasm for polycultures, relatively few robust experiments have been established, and even fewer have been maintained long enough to allow rotation-length consequences to be evaluated; - commercial polyculture plantations are even more scarce than experiments, and rarely offer data to support publication of financial analyses; - small landholders appear to be the main innovators in establishing and demonstrating polyculture plantations.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the current research}} void on local community views of changes in ecosystem services associated with rapid land use transformation {{in the context of}} plantation-based forestry. This interview-based study, conducted in southern China, aims at assessing the perspectives of local communities of: 1) the effects of Eucalyptus <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations</b> on selected ecosystem services and on local development; and 2) opportunities for future community livelihood development, based on the relations with the government and with forest industry operating locally. We analysed data from semi-structured interviews with 70 villagers for their views on changes in ecosystem services after the establishment of plantations, and their future expectations on the local livelihood development. Most interviewees mentioned some negative development on environmental quality after the establishment of the <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations,</b> especially on soil and water. Furthermore, the reduced productivity of cropland surrounding <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations,</b> coupled with other financial drivers, induced several villagers to switch from agricultural crops to household plantations. In the absence of destructive typhoons, household plantations can provide owners more free time, higher income, while <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations</b> provided some employment opportunities. Interviewees' expectations for the future included receiving financial support and capacity building for household plantations and crops, support to local roads and schools, and higher employment opportunities. Some interviewees suggested that solutions should be implemented for improving degraded water quality, while others suggested reducing forestry operations. Even though being highly context-specific, our findings open up the discussion about the further community development opportunities in the context of <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry.</b> In particular, the potential of value sharing mechanisms between the private sector and the local communities should be further studied.

At face value, <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> has much to offer {{in the search for}} happy endings.

This paper is not so much concerned with evaluating successes and failures with <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> so far, as it is with an analysis of the conditions under which the potential contribution of <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> to social vitality may be realised. It is argued {{that there is a need}} for better understanding of the social context for the challenges facing rural Australia (in particular, the relationships between economic restructuring, community well-being and environmental sustainability). Then, opportunities can be identified for enhancing the benefits of <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> and mitigating negative social outcomes including resource-use conflict. To realise these opportunities, strategies need to be developed that simultaneously regenerate social, natural and economic capital such as, for example, farm and catchment planning, localised value-adding and participatory decision-making. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{total amount}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations</b> {{around the world is}} still small {{compared}} with the total are of global forests, but <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> in the tropics is expected to increase quickly because of growing demand for timber and the depletion of wood from natural forests. <b>Forestry</b> <b>plantations</b> in the tropics have a comparative advantage over temperate plantations in terms of potentially higher yields. Tropical countries are trying to encourage greater private-sector investment in <b>forestry</b> <b>plantations</b> and downstream wood industries. In many countries, however, land ownership and access is disputed by a variety of stakeholders. A major challenge for plantation companies is to reach agreements with these stakeholders to ensure a supply of raw material. Agreements between plantation companies and communities or other stakeholders offer a means of meeting the different objectives of various groups. Yet, in actual forest planning decisions, some stakeholders have more power than the others. This is especially true when large international companies are dealing with local communities whose residents may have little understanding of what an agreement entails. In such a context whether agreements are sustainable is questionable. CIFOR's Plantation Programme is engaged in research to develop tools and methods for assessing and monitoring the viability of such agreements between plantation companies and other stakeholders...|$|R
40|$|Many factors {{influence}} {{adoption of}} <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> {{as part of}} the farm enterprise. This paper reviews earlier work, and reports the results of a study of these factors in North East Tasmania. Before landholders are likely to adopt <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry,</b> they must be motivated to consider adoption of a new enterprise, and be able to access adequate information on farm forestry. Information commonly sought by landholders when deciding whether or not to adopt includes that on the biophysical requirements for commercial tree crops, the opportunity costs incurred, and the infrastructure available for farm forestry. Evaluation of this information is influenced by the socioeconomic status, attitudes and values of the landholder. <b>Plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> may only be adopted if all of the above factors combine {{in such a way that}} this form of farm forestry is considered the optimal utilisation of an area of land being considered by the landholder for establishment under a new agricultural enterprise. Promoting the uptake of <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> on farms therefore requires development of adequate markets for the products of farm forestry, links between growers and those markets, credible information on economic returns, supportive regulatory environments and adequate information dissemination on farm forestry...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Plantation forests {{the world}} over have been {{established}} in order to supply industrial mills with wood. It is estimated that by 2050, {{over half of the}} world’s requirements for industrial timber could be supplied from plantations, thus reducing the pressure on natural forests. Ensuring that the plantation, with its many stands, different planted species, terrains, etc., delivers the correct volume of timber over time is a complex problem. Although many forest harvest models and systems have been described in the literature, not many have been described from a computer science or information systems perspective. In this paper, the <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> domain (based on South African experience) is described using formal models (Z notation), augmented by semi-formal (conceptual) models. Since plantations are generally planted to provide wood to mills, the forest-to-mill supply chain is described.

40|$|Private sector {{investment}} {{has become increasingly}} central to development in the global south, {{and in recent years}} these interventions have taken a ‘green’ turn. This is demonstrated via investment in economic activities associated with environmental claims, including <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> and carbon trading initiatives. Many of these green initiatives represent market-based responses to climate change that rely upon the implementation of mitigation strategies in the global south to offset industrial and polluting activities in the global north. In this paper we explore the activities of Green Resources, the largest <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> operator on the African continent. Through an examination of the activities of Green Resources in Uganda, this paper argues that while private sector international investment in <b>plantation</b> <b>forestry</b> for carbon offsetting is widely supported as responding to the nation 2 ̆ 7 s environmental crisis, {{it is part of a}} carbon colonialism and neoliberal land grab.

40|$|The rising {{demand for}} {{vegetable}} oil is inducing {{an expansion of}} oil palm cultivation in the tropics. In southern Cameroon oil palm smallholdings have been growing fast since the mid- 1990 s. Now, <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations</b> and smallholdings exist side by side. The current technical advice given to smallholders originates from agroindustrial practices. However, <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations</b> were created by planting on previous forest cover with no food intercrops, whereas for smallholdings food crops are a common previous cover and an intercrop during the juvenile phase. Technical advice used for <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations</b> may therefore not apply to smallholdings. Huge yield differences are observed in oil palm smallholdings, ranging from 2 to 14 t·ha- 1 of fresh fruit bunches, while in <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations</b> yields average 14 - 16 t·ha- 1. As no agronomic evaluation to date had explained those variations, we carried out a regional agronomic diagnosis of N and K nutrition on smallholder plots planted with selected oil palms. To prepare leaf samples and determine mineral contents, we used the same standardised method and the same laboratory as the regional <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations.</b> We compared smallholder leaf N and K contents with reference models of critical mineral contents, previously built with data from the high-yielding <b>industrial</b> <b>plantations.</b> Statistical links were also established between nutritional status and practices. Our results showed two groups of oil palm plantations: a group with N deficiencies ranging between 80 and 90 % of the reference and K deficiencies ranging from 45 to 90 % of the reference, and another group with satisfactory N and K status. The N deficiency was statistically linked to food cropping as the previous cover or as an intercrop, whilst K deficiency was qualitatively linked to an absence of K fertilisation.

This globally significant inland expansion has been poorly studied, if at all. No publications exist on this Suzano pulp project. Empirically, this article provides a baseline study on the political economic dynamics. The case is highly relevant for conflict theory. Generally, <b>industrial</b> tree <b>plantation</b> expansion has boosted grievances, but the resistance and conflicts have varied depending on the social actors' agency. In comparison to the high-intensity conflicts between the rural social movements such as the Brazilian Landless Movement (MST) and the pulp companies in most other new investments, there has been a rare absence of conflict in this case, as no movement has seized on local grievances. Conflicts cannot be studied in-depth by focusing only on conflict cases. Absence-cases open up an opportunity to revisit the question why conflicts arise. An analysis of this case allows an empirically rooted theoretical discussion on conflict causalities, which can answer several vexing questions in the study of conflicts. A new and generally applicable typology of different types of grievances is offered, and the grievances' causal relation to conflicts is examined. The importance of political dynamics and inter-personal relations in investment conflicts is emphasized. The way culture influences conflict dynamics is pondered upon by ethnography of the Brazilian conflict culture, where personal relations are more relevant in explaining conflict escalation than in the political systems with a stronger (impersonal) rule of law. The role of third parties such as other industries in the investment area is discussed. A qualitative comparative analysis of the major pulp project conflicts and their causes in Latin America is offered. Mobilization and thus conflict causality is explainable only when taking into account the types of grievances and the local, inter-personal, and organizational (state–business–movement) relations by which these are remediated and negotiated...|$|R
