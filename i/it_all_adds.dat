2500|$|David Wilson, {{editor and}} co-creator of the website Wilson & Alroys' Record Reviews, stated that [...] "By 2009, reggaeton had largely run its course, and Vico C wisely retrenched toward the minimalist Latin-ized hip hop of the Xplosión era (title track, with melodramatic but {{effective}} synth strings). There's nothing shockingly innovative like his first successes, {{but by now}} he's experienced enough {{to work with a}} limited palette while still giving each track an individual affect ('Prueba De Farmacia', which somehow manages not to be sappy; the salsified 'Aqui La Que Fallo Fue Usted'). Another of Vico C's strengths is his ability to vary vocal tone and timbre to suit a song: playfully prickly on 'Payasito'; tender on 'Moriré'; commanding on the upbraiding 'Polvora'. He still has an unfortunate tendency to moralize ('El Corazón Se Pone Bruto'; 'Angelina'), but his skills are equally undimmed by time, and though no one tune is a socks-rocker, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>adds</b> up to a satisfying whole." [...] Wilson gave the album 3 stars out of 5.|$|E

According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount Pictures for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company Disney wants for its own theme parks. In December, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.
