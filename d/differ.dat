5|$|A second {{species of}} Voalavo, eastern voalavo, was named in 2005 from central Madagascar. Morphological {{differences}} between the two are subtle but consistent, and the cytochrome b sequences of the two species <b>differ</b> by about 10%. In mammals, closely related species regularly <b>differ</b> by less than 5% in their cytochrome b sequences, and a divergence of more than 5% within a single species suggests the presence of cryptic species.|$|E

40|$|The {{concepts}} of well-being {{and quality of}} life concern evaluative judgements. There is insufficient understanding in current literature that these judgements are made variously due to not only use of <b>differing</b> values and <b>differing</b> research instruments but also <b>differing</b> standpoints, <b>differing</b> purposes, and <b>differing</b> theoretical views and ontological presuppositions. The paper elucidates these sources of differences and how they underlie the wide diversity of current conceptions...|$|R

5|$|Historiographical {{studies of}} the May Revolution do not face many doubts or unknown details. Most of the {{information}} was properly recorded {{at the time and}} was made available to the public by the Primera Junta as patriotic propaganda. Because of this, historical views on the topic <b>differ</b> in their interpretations of the meanings, causes and consequences of the events, rather than in the accuracy of their depiction of the events themselves. The modern version of events does not <b>differ</b> significantly from the contemporary one.|$|E

Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> from Eodromaeus based on features of the jaw bone, skull, cheek bones, and because it has much larger teeth in the premaxilla. Daemonosaurus <b>differs</b> from Eoraptor lunensis based {{on the presence of}} much larger premaxillary and anterior maxillary teeth and a much more restricted antorbital fossa on the maxilla.

5|$|The legal {{elements}} and {{features of the}} major federal public corruption offenses <b>differ.</b> The various jurisdictional elements of the offenses require that the prosecution prove, alternatively: that the payee was a federal official; that the payee organization received $10,000 in federal funds; that the corrupt communications involved {{the use of the}} mail or interstate wires; that the corruption affected interstate commerce or interstate travel. The mens rea elements <b>differ</b> in whether they require a quid pro quo; a mere nexus is an easier element to prove; more difficult elements to prove include the intent to be influenced and inducement. The offenses also <b>differ</b> in whether the act to be procured from the public official must be an official, a violation of an official duty, a fraud on the United States, or an official transaction. The offenses also <b>differ</b> in whether the payor may be prosecuted in addition to the public official. Finally, the offenses <b>differ</b> in whether they are predicates for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and money laundering prosecutions, and in the maximum authorized prison sentence that may be imposed upon conviction.|$|E

Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. The half-lives of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion are roughly 23–43hours and 24–50hours respectively.|$|E

Tracer diffusion and chemical diffusion <b>differ</b> {{in the level}} of adsorbate coverage at the surface, while intrinsic diffusion and mass transfer diffusion <b>differ</b> {{in the nature of the}} diffusion environment. Tracer diffusion and intrinsic diffusion both refer to systems where adparticles experience a relatively homogeneous environment, whereas in chemical and mass transfer diffusion adparticles are more strongly affected by their surroundings.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between this set and Mohanam set shown above it, is that the 3rd note <b>differs</b> between E and D# (reference note purpose only).

5|$|Weather fronts are {{boundaries}} between two masses of air of different densities, or different temperature and moisture properties, which normally are convergence zones {{in the wind}} field and are the principal cause of significant weather.
