A lease to the Fourth Avenue subway was given to the New York Municipal Railway Corporation, a subsidiary of the BMT, for forty-nine years as part of Contract 4. The Dual Contracts were signed on March 19, 1913. In 1912, during the <b>Dual</b> <b>System</b> negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway was recommended as part of the <b>Dual</b> <b>System,</b> and this recommendation was approved by the Board of Estimate on February 15, 1912. The PSC directed its Chief Engineer to create plans on June 14, 1912, and the contracts for the extension, Route 11B, was awarded on September 16, 1912. Later on, the plan for the extension was modified to include a connection with the Sea Beach Railroad between 64th and 65th Streets.|$|E

25|$|The {{change in}} {{subsidies}} {{is intended to}} be completed by 2011, but individual governments have some freedom to decide how the new scheme will be introduced. The UK government has decided to run a <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> of subsidies in England, each year transferring a larger proportion of the total payment to the new scheme. Payments under the old scheme were frozen at their levels averaged over 2002–2003 and reduce each subsequent year. This allows farmers in England a period where their income is maintained, but which they can use to change farm practices to accord with the new regime. Other governments have chosen to wait, and change the system in one go at the latest possible time. Governments also have limited discretion to continue to direct a small proportion of the total subsidy to support specific crops. Alterations to the qualifying rules meant that many small landowners became eligible to apply for grants and the Rural Payments Agency in England received double the previous number of applications (110,000).|$|E

They {{started their}} reigns as minors {{under the control}} of {{religious}} and civil regents and rarely exercised authority in their own names. For further continuity, the concept of multiple reincarnation of the first Zhabdrung—in the form of either his body, his speech, or his mind—was invoked by the Je Khenpo and the Druk Desi, both of whom wanted to retain the power they had accrued through the <b>dual</b> <b>system</b> of government. The last person recognized as the bodily reincarnation of Ngawang Namgyal died in the mid-18th century, but speech and mind reincarnations, embodied by individuals who acceded to the position of Zhabdrung Rinpoche, were recognized into the early 20th century. The power of the state religion also increased with a new monastic code that remained in effect in the early 1990s. The compulsory admission to monastic life of at least one son from any family having three or more sons was instituted in the late 17th century.
