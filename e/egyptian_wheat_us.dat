Screening of this wheat collection showed that the three alleles Xgwm 261 - 165, Xgwm 261 - 174 and Xgwm 261 - 192 bp were the most frequent.

40|$|In {{response}} to slow {{growth in the}} agricultural sector {{and as part of}} a general shift towards a more market-oriented economy, the Government of Egypt started liberalizing the agricultural sector in 1987. Controls over wheat production and marketing were eliminated and wheat producer prices were brought closer to international levels. As a result, there has been remarkable increases in wheat crop area and yields, causing wheat production to triple from 1986 to 1998. This study analyzes the results of a survey of 800 <b>Egyptian</b> <b>wheat</b> farmers in order to address three issues that are of interest to agricultural reform policy in Egypt. First, what are the patterns in wheat production and marketing that have emerged following the economic reforms? Second, why is the government unable to purchase more than a small portion of national wheat production? Third, how does wheat supply and input demand respond to wheat and input prices? The survey indicates that <b>Egyptian</b> <b>wheat</b> production is based on small-scale farms, yet these farms are highly commercialized and the use of inputs such as labor, fertilizer and irrigation, is intensive. The government has problems reaching its wheat procurement target because most of the wheat produced is consumed in the rural areas and farmers prefer to sell to traders because of better prices and location. Econometric analysis of the survey data suggests that wheat farmers respond significantly to crop and input prices. The estimated own-price supply elasticity is 0. 3, implying that the use of price policy alone to pursue wheat self-sufficiency would be costly and ill-advised.

40|$|Grain {{samples of}} 14 <b>Egyptian</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars were tested for seed-borne fungi. The deep {{freezing}} method was used.

A. flavus, A. niger and F. moniliforme were the most prevalent fungal species. Their incidence ranged from 21. 0 - 53. 5 %, 16. 0 - 37. 5 %, and 12. 0 - 31. 0 %, respectively. The antifungal potential of water extracts from aerial parts of five wild medicinal plants (Asclepias sinaica, Farsetia aegyptia, Hypericum sinaicum, Phagnalon sinaicum, and Salvia aegyptiaca) were collected from the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. The antifungal potential of water extracts from the aerial parts of these five plants were tested in the laboratory against the dominant fungi isolated from the wheat cultivars. All the aqueous plant extracts significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) reduced the incidence of the tested seed-borne fungi. But the extract of Asclepias sinaica exhibited the most antifungal activity on tested fungi at all concentrations used when compared with other plant extracts. Maximum infested grain germination was observed in Giza 168 and minimum in Bani Suef 5. Treating grains with plant extract of A. sinaica (10 %) enhanced the percentage of grain germination of all cultivars in both laboratory and pot experiments. Maximum root and shoot length of seedlings was recorded in Bani Suef 4 during fungal infestation or treatment by plant extract. For one hour before sowing or storage, the aqueous extract of A. sinaica {{can be used to}} treat wheat grains, to reduce the fungal incidence.

40|$|ABSTRACT Powdery mildew {{of wheat}} (Triticum spp.) caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (DC) E. O. Speer Em. Marchal {{is one of}} the most {{important}} bread wheat diseases in Egypt. All the <b>Egyptian</b> common bread <b>wheat</b> cultivars are susceptible to that disease at seedling and adult stages. Breeding of resistant cultivars is the most economical and environmentally safe method to eliminate the disease and reduce crop losses. Combinations of two or more effective resistance genes may lead to better, more durable resistance to that disease. Eight Pm genes i. e. Pm 2, Pm 6, Pm 12, Pm 16, Pm 24, Pm 35, Pm 36 and Pm 37 out of 21 powdery mildew monogenic wheat lines (Pm) were resistant to 42 individual isolates of powdery mildew collected from different governorates in the Nile Delta area, Egypt, at seedling and adult stages. Only four DNA specific SSR markers (Xgwm 337, Xcfd 7 linked to Pm 24, Pm 35 and Xgwm 332, Xwmc 790) linked to Pm 37 resistance genes were selected to detect these genes in 13 <b>Egyptian</b> common bread <b>wheat</b> cultivars.

The peculiar small-eared and small-grained wheat, already alluded to, was the commonest kind during the Stone period; it lasted down to the Helvetico-Roman age, and then became extinct. A second kind was rare at first, but afterwards became more frequent. A third, the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>wheat</b> (T. turgidum), does not agree exactly with any existing variety, and was rare during the Stone period. A fourth kind (T. dicoccum) differs from all known varieties of this form. A fifth kind (T. monococcum) {{is known to have}} existed during the Stone period only by the presence of a single ear. A sixth kind, the common T. spelta, was not introduced into Switzerland until the Bronze age. Of barley, besides the short-eared and small-grained kind, two others were cultivated, one of which was very scarce, and resembled our present common H. distichum. During the Bronze age rye and oats were introduced; the oat- grains being somewhat smaller than those produced by our existing varieties. The poppy was largely cultivated during the Stone period, probably for its oil; but the variety which then existed is not now known. A peculiar pea with small seeds lasted from the Stone to the Bronze age, and then became extinct; whilst a peculiar bean, likewise having small seeds, came in at the Bronze period and lasted to the time of the Romans. These details sound like the descriptions given by palaeontologists of the first appearance, the increasing rarity, and final extinction or modification of fossil species, embedded in the successive stages of a geological formation.|$|R
