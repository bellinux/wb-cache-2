50|$|The {{block was}} made of cast iron (with the {{exception}} of some made of aluminium alloy for racing engines), with the crankcase split on the centreline of the seven-bearing crankshaft. The crankshaft {{was made of}} EN16 steel, heat treated prior to machining. An innovation was the fitting of a proprietary Metalastik vibration damper on {{the nose of the}} crankshaft to eliminate damaging crankshaft resonances. The design and materials of the bottom end of the engine hardly changed throughout its life, apart from the changes dictated by the respaced cylinders of the 4.2-litre version (also used by the 'new 3.4' litre version). The oil pump was changed {{after a couple of years}} from a relatively inefficient <b>gear-type</b> <b>pump</b> to a Hobourn-Eaton eccentric-lobe unit.|$|E
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} brake system {{consists of a}} hydraulic pump (usually a <b>gear-type</b> <b>pump),</b> a fluid reservoir, and piping between the two parts. Inserted in the piping is an adjustable valve, and between the pump and the valve is a gauge or other means of measuring hydraulic pressure. In simplest terms, the engine is brought up to the desired RPM and the valve is incrementally closed. As the pumps outlet is restricted, the load increases and the throttle is simply opened until at the desired throttle opening. Unlike most other systems, power is calculated by factoring flow volume (calculated from pump design specifications), hydraulic pressure, and RPM. Brake HP, whether figured with pressure, volume, and RPM, or with a different load cell-type brake dyno, should produce essentially identical power figures. Hydraulic dynos are renowned for having the quickest load change ability, just slightly surpassing eddy current absorbers. The downside is that they require large quantities of hot oil under high pressure and an oil reservoir.|$|E

40|$|The {{service life}} of a <b>gear-type</b> oil <b>pump</b> with {{variable}} displacement {{is affected by the}} reliability of its drive system. To analyse the reliability of the drive system and improve the service life of the oil pump, a virtual prototype model was established based on real conditions and multi-body dynamic theory. The model was validated according to bench test results. And simulation results were in good agreement with test results. A numerical method was used to simulate the dynamics model and the dynamic meshing forces of gear pairs were obtained. A reliability evaluation model of the drive system was built. The reliability of each part and the entire drive system were calculated. And system reliability was analysed and discussed when 45 steel or 40 Cr was utilised as the material for the drive system. The results provided a foundation for the reliability design and the dynamic optimisation of a <b>gear-type</b> oil <b>pump</b> with variable displacement...|$|R
40|$|There {{are tens of}} {{thousands}} of flooded mines in Europe, which of majority has unknown areas that cannot be searched by divers. A robot must be developed in order to examine the mines and decide about reopening them. This robot has to be autonomous, and able to navigate through the narrow tunnels and shafts. Its propulsion system is a crucial part of exploring the mines. The robot being a submarine, it should also be able to adjust its buoyancy. These two systems allow for the vertical movement of the submarine, propul-sion system being the only means to move horizontally. This thesis is focused on the vertical control systems, and the challenges the required very small size will create. It is worth mentioning that a similar robotic submarine has not been developed earlier, which makes the project interesting. In this thesis, first, some basic principles of submarine diving and its depth control methods are explained and different ballast system operating principles are compared and explained. The propulsion system is tested, its performance is evaluated and differ-ent methods for usage of thrusters is studied. The submarine should have four thrusters on both sides in a manifold that is integrated to the hull, in order to maintain spherical shape. Two horizontal ones on each side, for dependability, and two vertical ones as well. The energy efficient way is to move slowly and avoid active braking. The buoyancy control system is the more complex of the two vertical control systems. Considering many different options, the most suitable system for this robot shall have a small brushless electric motor, micro-hydraulic pump, shutoff valve and ballast cylinders that are used to control the weight of the submarine. The system will use oil as the me-dia instead of water, because of issues with availability and size of water hydraulic components. The power consumption of these two systems was measured in case of thrusters and simulated in case of buoyancy control and a guideline when to use one or the other was formed. The buoyancy control is less energy-efficient than it could, mostly because of the low efficiency of the small <b>gear-type</b> <b>pump.</b> The system would be greatly improved if the pump could be replaced with a more efficient one...|$|E
