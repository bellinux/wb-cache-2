O experimento foi conduzido nas instalaÃÃes do Setor de Cunicultura do Departamento de Zootecnia/UFC. O Ãndice de conforto tÃrmico dentro da instalaÃÃo foi calculado de acordo com a fÃrmula do ITU, modificada para coelhos. Foram utilizados 20 coelhos da raÃa Nova ZelÃndia Branca, criados em sistema flat-deck, alimentados com raÃÃo comercial. Os ejaculados foram coletados duas vezes por semana (outubro/ 2009 a setembro/ 2010), utilizando-se uma vagina artificial. Em seguida, os ejaculados foram avaliados quanto ao volume, cor, aspecto, vigor, motilidade e concentraÃÃo espermÃtica, apÃs foram centrifugados e o PS (plasma seminal) foi removido e acondicionado em tubos eppendorfs a - 18 oC. Para realizaÃÃo das anÃlises bioquÃmicas foi feito um pool mensal de PS de cada animal, onde foram avaliadas as concentraÃÃes de glicose, frutose, colesterol total e proteÃnas totais. Neste estudo, os parÃmetros seminais foram influenciados significativamente (p< 0, 05) pelo mÃs de coleta, independente da existÃncia de estresse pelo calor. Na avaliaÃÃo dos parÃmetros seminais pela cor foi verificado que os ejaculados de cor branca perolada foram representativos da boa qualidade do sÃmen. Quanto ao aspecto, os melhores resultados foram encontrados nos ejaculados com aspecto cremo-leitoso. No que se refere Ãs caracterÃsticas bioquÃmicas, o aspecto do ejaculado influenciou significativamente (p< 0, 05) somente as concentraÃÃes de frutose e glicose. Foram constatadas diferenÃas significativas das concentraÃÃes de frutose entre os diferentes meses do ano. A glicose foi identificada como um constituinte, comumente encontrada no PS. A concentraÃÃo de colesterol total no PS de coelhos no presente experimento foi mais baixa que o encontrado por outros autores. O estudo das correlaÃÃes de Pearson demonstrou associaÃÃes significativas (baixas e moderadas), positivas e negativas entre os parÃmetros seminais e os bioquÃmicos. Os parÃmetros bioquÃmicos apresentaram correlaÃÃes entre si. Nesse estudo foi encontrada correlaÃÃo negativa da concentraÃÃo espermÃtica com a frutose. Os resultados permitiram concluir demonstram que os coelhos criados no nordeste do Brasil sÃo perfeitamente adaptados, pois apresentam caracterÃsticas seminais e bioquÃmicas normais, apesar da existÃncia de estresse tÃrmico. This {{study was}} carried out to {{characterize}} the biochemical composition of seminal plasma and semen parameters of rabbits reared in Northeast Brazil, also identifying the changes that occur throughout the year. The experiment was conducted at the Sector of the Rabbit Department of Animal Science / UFC. The index of thermal comfort inside the facility was constructed according to the formula of the THI, modified for rabbits. The ejaculates were obtained twice a week from 20 New Zealand White rabbits, reared in <b>flat-deck</b> <b>system</b> (October/ 2009 to September/ 2010). After collection, the semen was measured and evaluated for volume, color, appearance, vigor, sperm concentration and motility. To obtain the SP, the semen was centrifuged and then stored at - 18 ÂC. To perform the biochemical analysis was made a monthly pool of PS of each animal. The samples were tested according to the concentrations of fructose, glucose, total cholesterol and total protein. In this study, semen parameters were affected significantly (p < 0. 05) by sampling month, {{despite the presence of}} heat stress. In the evaluation of semen parameters was found that the color of the ejaculates was pearly white representative of good semen quality. Regarding the aspect, the best results were found in ejaculates with cream-milky appearance. With regard to biochemical characteristics, the aspect of the ejaculate significantly (p < 0. 05) only the concentrations of fructose and glucose. Significant differences in concentrations of fructose among the different months of the year. Glucose was identified as a constituent, usually found in the PS. Significant differences in concentrations of fructose among the different months of the year. Glucose was identified as a constituent, usually found in the PS. The study of the Pearson correlations showed significant associations (low and moderate) positive and negative differences between the semen parameters and biochemical. In this study we found a negative correlation with sperm concentration of fructose. The results showed that rabbits show created in Northeastern Brazil are perfectly adapted, as seminal and biochemical characteristics have normal, despite the existence of heat stress...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Egg shell {{damage was}} {{evaluated}} {{in different parts}} of production and processing systems in various locations in the state of Indiana. Eggs were sampled and hand candled to determine damage at the cage or at the first access point in <b>flat-deck</b> <b>systems,</b> on the transfer belt for in-line systems; on flats if eggs were cased and shipped to the processing plant; ahead of the washer; after washing and candling; and in the carton. These locations were chosen because they represent potential damage sites. Damage ranged from a low of 0. 0 % at some locations to a high of 35 % at others. The percent of cracked eggs tended to increase the further the eggs traveled in the processing procedure. Point of lay damage was found to average 3. 5 %, which was also the same as damage in the carton. By using surveys such as this combined with employee training programs, steps can be taken to minimize breakage. POULTRY SCIENCE 55 : 758 - 761, 1976 CRACKED eggs cost money. U. S. pro-ducers and processors are losing millions of dollars per year to cracked or broken eggs. Damaged egg loss is frequently considered as part of the production cost. When held to a minimum this is acceptable; however, if damage begins to increase and the actual loss figure is never analyzed, the cost to the producer or processor may exceed what is considered as normal in cost of production or operation. Based on estimates of U. S. egg production, as reported by U. S. D. A., being approxi-mately 184 million cases in 1974, the annual loss to the industry could then be almost 2 million cases for each 1 % of broken eggs. With breakage frequently between 3 and 5 %, this loss figure is sizable. In times of slim margins a small producer may experience losses which mean the difference in a profit or loss. It was because these losses often go almost unnoticed or uncorrected that this survey was conducted. The objectives of the study were to evalu-ate the problem of cracked or broken eggs in laying houses and egg processing plants...|$|R
