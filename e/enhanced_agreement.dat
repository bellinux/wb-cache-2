40|$|The paper {{conducts a}} {{critical}} analysis of the potential legal basis {{and scope of the}} future European Union (EU) -Ukraine <b>enhanced</b> <b>agreement.</b> Accepting that the most probable and most beneficial possibility for Ukraine is to conclude an association agreement with the EU on the basis of Article 310 EC Treaty (EC), it is argued that the objectives of the enhanced co-operation between the EU and Ukraine - as expected and desired by the Ukrainian political élite - could be achieved by a partnership agreement concluded on the basis of Article 181 a EC. Furthermore, if the new enhanced EU-Ukraine agreement were concluded as a partnership agreement, it might be better suited for the solving of certain political and legal challenges in contemporary EU-Ukraine relations. First, a new <b>enhanced</b> <b>agreement</b> concluded on the basis of Article 181 a EC would not entail unjustified political expectations - on the part of Ukraine - of obtaining the perspective of full EU-membership in the near future. Second, a future EU-Ukraine partnership agreement would be the best option for a “transitional” <b>enhanced</b> <b>agreement</b> before the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force. Third, a future partnership agreement between the EU and Ukraine will not undermine the fundamentals of the evolving strategic partnership between the EU and Russia...|$|E

Indications are that dimethyl sulfide production rates must be adjusted for latitude dependence to match recent compilations. This may reflect the need for phytoplankton to conserve nitrogen by favoring sulfurous osmolytes.

Using a stylized model, we show that adaptive measures can be used strategically and that their inclusion in environmental <b>agreements</b> <b>enhances</b> <b>agreement</b> stability and can even lead to full cooperation. However, adaptation does not help cooperation in mitigation policies.

40|$|A {{large number}} of delegates from {{different}} institutional levels within the EU have achieved a remarkable consensus on a draft constitution. Has this consensus been made possible because the nationally predominant left-right divide was only weakly present during the deliberations of the delegates? Left-right differences have been analysed {{by means of a}} content analysis on submitted documents during the European Convention. The data analysis confirms our assumption that the left-right distinction was relevant, although not very dominant. The draft constitution did not take a mean position on left and right issues, but in fact puts more emphasis on substantial goals related to both left and right, giving an equal weight to both anti-poles. However, if we exclude the Charter of Human Rights, the draft constitution appears to be strongly tilted to the right. The analysis also shows that party family differences did affect the process of coalition building during the Convention, since {{more than half of all}} documents have been submitted together with at least one member of the same party family and/or with one family member close by. Our analysis also indicates that the process of consensus building was enhanced by the absence of many extremist and new parties during the Convention. This may have <b>enhanced</b> <b>agreement</b> on the Constitution, but later it became problematic for the domestic democratic process and for the acceptance of the Constitution in some countries, such as France and the Netherlands, especially since some of the excluded parties have actively and successfully mobilised voters to vote against the Constitution. © 2008 The Authors...|$|E
40|$|Experimental results {{obtained}} {{as part of}} a series of experiments on dendritic growth in microgravity, the isothermal dendritic growth experiment (IDGE), indicate that Ivantsov's transport solution to the dendrite problem is valid to "rst order. The data reveal a PeH clet (Pe) number vs. supercooling relationship that is both systematically lower than expected, and exhibits larger scatter than is accounted for by the uncertainties of the individual data points. A range of explanations have been o!ered, including residual convection, far-"eld chamber e!ects, and dendrite self-interaction. Although some of these explain certain features of the experimental data, quantitative evidence remains lacking concerning the cause of the two issues mentioned above. This investigation examines the dendritic growth data in the context of how the actual shape of the dendrite tip and its trailing side-branch structure may a!ect the transport process. The method of moving heat sources is used to describe the di!usive thermal transport processes around a crystalline body of revolution growing into its quiescent melt at a constant rate. Results indicate that when Ivantsov's assumed paraboloidal tip shape is modi"ed to better re#ect the actual observed tip shape, <b>enhanced</b> <b>agreement</b> can be obtained between the model and the experimental data. Additionally, these results support earlier work by Schaefer (J. Crystal Growth 43 (1978) 17) in predicting that under the conditions of the IDGE experiment, the side-branch region of a dendrite can contribute signi"cantly to the thermal "eld at the tip. This suggests that the scatter in the IDGE data can be explained by stochasti...|$|E

40|$|Multichannel intraluminal {{impedance}} (MII) detects bolus {{flow through}} a healthy pharynx. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine whether the technique detects bolus flow and retention in patients with pharyngeal dysphagia; develop appropriate impedance-based criteria for assessing patients and to provide some preliminary insights into the clinical utility of the technique. Pharyngo-oesophageal pressure and impedance were recorded simultaneously with videofluoroscopy (VF) during swallows in six patients with dysphagia. Agreement, as to the presence or absence of bolus material, between the VF and MII was expressed using the Cohen's Kappa statistic. To test whether the impedance criteria for the detection of bolus passage in dysphagia could be improved, a Kappa statistic was calculated in an iterative process for a range of impedance values (100 %- 0 %) defining bolus head entry and bolus tail clearance from the pharynx. Bolus presence according to the MII criteria previously derived by us in healthy controls demonstrated a modest correlation with VF when applied to this dysphagia population [0. 37, 0. 5 and 0. 58 in the hypopharynx, upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS) and proximal oesophagus respectively]. In the patient population, the optimal impedance criteria were 50 % for bolus head entry and 20 % for bolus tail clearance. Adopting these criteria demonstrated <b>enhanced</b> <b>agreement</b> between VF and impedance; yielding Kappa coefficients of 0. 42 in the hypopharynx, 0. 54 in the UOS and 0. 62 in the proximal oesophagus. With the adoption of appropriate criteria, pharyngeal impedance measurement can accurately detect bolus passage and failed or impaired clearance during swallowing in patients with dysphagia. M. M.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of a progressive collapse of structures using computer {{has a very}} actual apprehension for structural engineers due to their interest in structures veracity estimation. This simulation helps engineers to develop methods for increasing or decreasing the progressive failure. Finite Element Method (FEM) is the most computer simulation analysis currently used to perform a structural vulnerability assessment. Unfortunately, FEM {{is not able to}} automatically analyze a structure after element separation and collision which has a great effect on a structure’s performance during collapse. For instances, a bombing load can cause damage to a main supporting column in a structure, which will cause debris flying at a very high velocity from the damaged column. This debris can cause another local failure in another column upon impact and lead to the progressive collapse of the whole structure. A new simulation technique, which was developed in 1995 as part of Tagel-Din’s doctoral research, called Applied Element Method (AEM) can simulate the structure’s behaviour from zero loading until collapse, through the elastic phase, opening and propagation of cracks, yielding of reinforcement bars and separation and collision of elements. This method is used in Extreme Loading for Structures software (ELS) by Applied Science International (ASI). In the current paper, {{a brief description of the}} AEM is given. Also, numerical modelling based on two experimental studies available in the literature conducted by Ahmadi et al. and Yi et al. are generated using ELS. These models are used to confirm the capability of AEM in simulation the progressive collapse behaviour of structures. Also, the models are utilized to examine and measure the structural resisting mechanisms of reinforced concrete structures against progressive collapse. The obtained numerical results indicated that, ELS can accurately model all structural behaviour stages up to collapse. A better agreement between the experimental and numerical results is observed. Moreover, the results obtained with ELS indicated an <b>enhanced</b> <b>agreement</b> with other software packages such as; OpenSees, Ansys, Abacus, and MSC Marc...|$|E
40|$|Foreword The Max Weber post-doctoral Programme is {{a unique}} programme. In 2007 – 2008, there were forty Fellows on the Programme, {{covering}} {{a wide range of}} research interests within the Social Sciences and Humanities, and representing twenty-three nationalities. Among the different activities of the academic year, the conference on “European integration without membership: models, experiences, perspectives” {{is a good example of}} Fellows’ initiative and their concern for relevant issues. Encouraged by Professor Marise Cremona of the Law Department of the EUI, three Max Weber Fellows, Francesco Maiani, Roman Petrov and Ekaterina Mouliarova, took the initiative to organize the conference, invite the participants, actively participate in its development and, finally, act as editors of the proceedings which follow. The Max Weber Programme, in collaboration with the Law Department, fully supported their initiative, but the credit is theirs and that of the participants who contributed to the conference. Since its foundation more than thirty years ago, “European Integration” has been a recurrent theme in the research agenda of the European University Institute – specially within the Law Department. The conference built on this long tradition, but also took from the new perspectives that young postdoctoral Fellows, with different national experiences, can bring to the discussion, a discussion that brings forward new issues, when the EU 27 must reassess its relationships with neighbouring countries that form part of the broader European area without aiming at becoming EU members in the years to come. A fruitful discussion on this relevant issue needs academic reflection, as well as practical legal and political experience, it needs understanding of the EU perspective, as well as that of neighbouring countries. It is again to the credit of the organizers that in the panels of the conference all these perspectives were present in open discussion. The proceedings that follow bring together the papers presented in this conference that took place at our beloved Villa La Fonte on May 23 - 24, 2008. Ramon Marimon Director of the Max Weber ProgrammeAt the beginning of the 1990 s, the concept of “European integration” could still be said to be fairly unambiguous. Nowadays, it has become plural and complex almost to the point of unintelligibility. This is due, of course, to the internal differentiation of EU membership, with several Member States pulling out of key integrative projects such as establishing an area without frontiers, the “Schengen” area, and a common currency. But this is also due to the differentiated extension of key integrative projects to European non-EU countries – Schengen is again a case in point. Such processes of “integration without membership”, the focus of the present publication, are acquiring an ever-growing topicality both in the political arena and in academia. International relations between the EU and its neighbouring countries are crucial for both, and their development through new agreements features prominently on the continent’s political agenda. Over and above this aspect, the dissemination of EU values and standards beyond the Union’s borders raises a whole host of theoretical and methodological questions, unsettling in some cases traditional conceptions of the autonomy and separation of national legal orders. This publication brings together the papers presented at the Integration without EU Membership workshop held in May 2008 at the EUI (Max Weber Programme and Department of Law). It aims to compare different models and experiences of integration between the EU, on the one hand, and those European countries that do not currently have an accession perspective on the other hand. In delimiting the geographical scope of the inquiry, so as to scale it down to manageable proportions, the guiding principles have been to include both the “Eastern” and “Western” neighbours of the EU, and to examine both structured frameworks of cooperation, such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the European Economic Area, and bilateral relations developing on a more ad hoc basis. These principles are reflected in the arrangement of the papers, which consider in turn the positions of Ukraine, Russia, Norway, and Switzerland in European integration – current standing, perspectives for evolution, consequences in terms of the EU-ization of their respective legal orders 1. These subjects are examined from several perspectives. We had the privilege of receiving contributions from leading practitioners and scholars from the countries concerned, from EU highranking officials, from prominent specialists in EU external relations law, and from young and talented researchers. We wish to thank them all here for their invaluable insights. We are moreover deeply indebted to Marise Cremona (EUI, Law Department, EUI) for her inspiring advice and encouragement, as well as to Ramon Marimon, Karin Tilmans, Lotte Holm, Alyson Price and Susan Garvin (Max Weber Programme, EUI) for their unflinching support throughout this project. A word is perhaps needed on the propriety and usefulness of the research concept embodied in this publication. Does it make sense to compare the integration models and experiences of countries as different as Norway, Russia, Switzerland, and Ukraine? Needless to say, this list of four evokes a staggering diversity of political, social, cultural, and economic conditions, and at least as great a diversity of approaches to European integration. Still, we would argue that such diversity only makes comparisons more meaningful. Indeed, while the particularities and idiosyncratic elements of each “model” of integration are fully displayed in the present volume, common themes and preoccupations run through the pages of every contribution: the difficulty in conceptualizing the finalité and essence of integration, which is evident in the EU today but which is greatly amplified for non-EU countries; the asymmetries and tradeoffs between integration and autonomy that are inherent in any attempt to participate in European integration from outside; the alteration of deeply seated legal concepts, and concepts about the law, that are already observable in the most integrated of the non-EU countries concerned. These issues are not transient or coincidental: they are inextricably bound up with the integration of non-EU countries in the EU project. By publishing this collection, we make no claim to have dealt with them in an exhaustive, still less in a definitive manner. Our ambition is more modest: to highlight the relevance of these themes, to place them more firmly on the scientific agenda, and to provide a stimulating basis for future research and reflection.
