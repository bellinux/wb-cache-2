40|$|Thermal management, {{multifunctional}} structuresThe multifunctional {{support structure}} (MFSS) technology is promising {{a reduction of}} overall mass and packing volume for spacecraft (S/C) electronic components. This technology eliminates the electronic box chassis and the cabling between the boxes by integrating the electronics, thermal control and the structural support into one single element. The ultimate goal of the MFSS technology is to reduce size, weight, power consumption, cost and production time for future spacecraft components. The paper focus on the main challenges and solutions related to the thermal management within the MFSS technology based on the selected charge regulator (CR) application.

We suggest a model that considers the fibre geometry and appearance. It is based on a two-dimensional shot-noise process. The model is fit by minimizing a weighted least squares distance between the model-based and estimated covariance functions and this provides estimates of the fibre size, intensity and the non-uniform distribution of the fibre orientation. The model is applied to simulated and real data. Copyright 2005 Board of the Foundation of the Scandinavian Journal of Statistics [...] ...|$|R
40|$|PETTITT (1950) erected {{the species}} Cretirhynchia magna for a rhynchonellide brachiopod {{collected}} from the Upper Chalk of Trimingham, Norfolk, England. On the basis of specimens of this species {{made available to the}} authors, serial transverse sections and SEM examination of the shell microstructure were performed. Macro-morphological characters observed assign this material to the genus Septatoechia LOBATSCHEVA & TITOVA, 1977. The early Maastrichtian Cyclothyris elegans (VON HANSTEIN, 1879) collected from Ciply (Hainaut, Belgium) is reappraised and its generic allocation is also changed due to the macromorphological characteristics fitting the genus Septatoechia. The shell microstructure pattern of the secondary shell layer of both species is ‘fine fibrous’ (leptinoid). The discrepancy in the shell microstructure patterns between western representatives (S. magna and S. elegans) and the eastern representatives (S. inflate and S. amudariensis) stimulated revision of previous published information. Careful re-examination of unpublished results revealed problems with the original description of the shell microstructure of S. inflate and S. amudariensis due to the use of oblique lateral sections of the <b>fibres.</b> Emended <b>description</b> of the shell microstructure of S. inflate and S. amudariensis is herein provided.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{systematic}} fibre bundle formulation of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The {{new form of}} the theory {{is equivalent to the}} usual one but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and potentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a (Hilbert) fibre bundle. It's evolution is determined through the bundle (analogue of the) Schrödinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this work. The present fourth part of this series is devoted mainly to the <b>fibre</b> bundle <b>description</b> of mixed quantum states. We show that to the conventional density operator there corresponds a unique density morphism (along paths) for which the corresponding equations of motion are derived. It is also investigated the bundle description of mixed quantum states in the different pictures of motion. We calculate the curvature of the evolution transport and prove that it is curvature free iff the values of the Hamiltonian operator at different moments commute.

40|$|A small-mass {{system has}} been {{developed}} for monitoring the flux of neutrons with energy up to 1 MeV at the new time-of-flight facility at CERN, n_TOF. The monitor {{is based on a}} thin Mylar foil with a Li- 6 deposit, placed in the neutron beam, and an array of Silicon detectors, placed outside the beam, for detecting the products of the Li- 6 (n, alpha) H- 3 reaction. The small amount of material on the beam ensures a minimal perturbation of the flux and minimizes the background related to scattered neutrons. Moreover, a further reduction of the gamma-ray background has been obtained by constructing the scattering chamber hosting the device in carbon <b>fibre.</b> A detailed <b>description</b> of the flux monitor is here presented, together with the characteristics of the device, in terms of efficiency, resolution and induced background.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal, Applied Ergonomics [© Elsevier], which is available online at: [URL] thermal insulation of clothing {{is one of the}} most important parameters used in the thermal comfort model adopted by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) (ISO 7730, 2005) and by ASHRAE (ASHRAE- 55, 2005). To date, thermal insulation values of mainly Western clothing have been published with only minimal data being available for non-Western clothing. Thus, the objective of the present study is to measure and present the thermal insulation (clo) values of a number of Arabian Gulf garments as worn by males and females. The clothing ensembles and garments of Arabian Gulf males and females presented in this study are representative of those typically worn in the region during both summer and winter seasons. Measurements of total thermal insulation values (clo) were obtained using a male and a female shape thermal manikin in accordance with the definition of insulation as given in ISO 9920. In addition, the clothing area factors (ƒcl) determined in two different ways were compared. The first method used a photographic technique and the second a regression equation as proposed in ISO 9920, based on the insulation values of Arabian Gulf male and female garments and ensembles as they were determined in this study. In addition, <b>fibre</b> content, <b>descriptions</b> and weights of Arabian Gulf clothing have been recorded and tabulated in this study. The findings of this study are presented as additions to the existing knowledge base of clothing insulation, and provide for the first time data for Arabian Gulf clothing. The analysis showed that for these non-Western clothing designs, the most widely-used regression calculation of cl f is not valid. However, despite the very large errors in cl f made with the regression method, the errors this causes in the intrinsic clothing insulation value, cl I, are limited...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the {{connection}} responsible for any abelian or non abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect with n parallel “magnetic ” flux lines in R 3, lies in a trivial G-principal bundle P → M, i. e. P is isomorphic to the product M × G, where G is any path connected topological group; in particular a connected Lie group. We also show that two other bundles are involved: the universal covering space ˜ M → M, where path integrals are computed, and the associated bundle P ×G C m → M, where the wave function and its covariant derivative are sections. Key words: Aharonov-Bohm effect; fibre bundle theory; gauge invariance. As is well known, the magnetic Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) effect 1, 2 is a gauge invariant, non local quantum phenomenon, with gauge group U(1), which {{takes place in a}} non simply connected space. It involves a magnetic field in a region where an electrically charged particle obeying the Schroedinger equation cannot enter, i. e. the ordinary 3 -dimensional space minus the space occupied by the solenoid producing the field; in the ideal mathematical limit, the solenoid is replaced by a flux line. Locally, the particle couples to the magnetic potential A but not to the magnetic field B; however, the effect is gauge invariant since it only depends on the flux of B inside the solenoid. The <b>fibre</b> bundle theoretic <b>description</b> of this kind of phenomena has proved to be very useful to obtai...|$|R
40|$|Carding is an {{essential}} pre-spinning process whereby masses of dirty tufted fibres are cleaned, disentangled and refined into a smooth coherent web. Research and development in this `low-technology' industry have hitherto depended on empirical evidence. In collaboration with the School of Textile Industries at the University of Leeds, a mathematical theory has been developed that describes the passage of fibres through the carding machine. The fibre dynamics in the carding machine are posed, modelled and simulated by three distinct physical problems: the journey of a single fibre, the extraction of fibres from a tuft or tufts and many interconnecting, entangled <b>fibres.</b> A <b>description</b> {{of the life of}} a single fibre is given as it is transported through the carding machine. Many fibres are sparsely distributed across machine surfaces, therefore interactions with other neighbouring fibres, either hydrodynamically or by frictional contact points, can be neglected. The aerodynamic forces overwhelm the fibre's ability to retain its crimp or natural curvature, and so the fibre is treated as an inextensible string. Two machine topologies are studied in detail, thin annular regions with hooked surfaces and the nip region between two rotating drums. The theoretical simulations suggest that fibres do not transfer between carding surfaces in annular machine geometries. In contrast to current carding theories, which are speculative, a novel explanation is developed for fibre transfer between the rotating drums. The mathematical simulations describe two distinct mechanisms: strong transferral forces between the taker-in and cylinder and a weaker mechanism between cylinder and doffer. Most fibres enter the carding machine connected to and entangled with other fibres. Fibres are teased from their neighbours and in the case where their neighbours form a tuft, which is a cohesive and resistive fibre structure, a model has been developed to understand how a tuft is opened and broken down during the carding process. Hook-fibre-tuft competitions are modelled in detail: a single fibre extracted from a tuft by a hook and diverging hook-entrained tufts with many interconnecting fibres. Consequently, for each scenario once fibres have been completely or partially extracted, estimates can be made as to {{the degree to which a}} tuft has been opened-up. Finally, a continuum approach is used to simulate many interconnected, entangled fibre-tuft populations, focusing in particular on their deformations. A novel approach describes this medium by density, velocity, directionality, alignment and entanglement. The materials responds to stress as an isotropic or transversely isotropic medium dependent on the degree of alignment. Additionally, the material's response to stress is a function of the degree of entanglement which we describe by using braid theory. Analytical solutions are found for elongational and shearing flows, and these compare very well with experiments for certain parameter regimes...|$|R
