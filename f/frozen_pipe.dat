5000|$|... 2015-2016: A <b>frozen</b> <b>pipe</b> burst on February 17, 2015, in {{the lower}} level of the West Branch, filling it with 5 ft of water. After a year's worth of renovations, the branch re-opened {{to the public in}} May 2016 after a {{significant}} remodel. Renovations totaled close to a half a million dollars worth in materials, shelves and furnishings, elevator, walls, doors, a heating/cooling system, and windows.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, when FM {{emerged as the}} leading {{technology}} for music, WEDO gradually dropped its music for the program-oriented format that it originally had in its formative years. As McKeesport's downtown economy continued to deteriorate, so did tenant business in Midtown Plaza Mall, {{as many of the}} stores went out of business or relocated into the suburbs. With few tenants left in the building, the property's managers turned off heat to several areas of the mall in an effort to reduce operating costs. A heating problem one day in 2000 resulted in a <b>frozen</b> <b>pipe</b> bursting in the mall and leaving the radio station in about two inches of standing water. According to a former employee, it was the second time that such an incident occurred.|$|E
5000|$|Conditions within blizzards {{often include}} large {{quantities}} of blowing snow and strong winds which may significantly reduce visibility. Reduced viability of personnel on foot may result in extended exposure to the blizzard and increase the chance of becoming lost. The strong winds associated with blizzards create wind chill that can result in frostbites and hypothermia. The strong winds present in blizzards are capable of damaging plants and may cause power outrages, <b>frozen</b> <b>pipes,</b> and cut off fuel lines ...|$|R
50|$|Severn Trent Water, which {{provides}} water to central England {{and parts of}} Wales, said it had drafted in extra staff as ruptured and <b>frozen</b> <b>pipes</b> began to thaw. Many pipes had ruptured in the Welsh Marches and a sewerage pipe had become blocked in outer Birmingham. The company's senior operations manager, Fraser Pithie, said the firm had been called out to more than 470 burst and ruptured pipes since the 10th and their call centre staff had taken more than 10,000 calls.|$|R
50|$|The {{visit of}} Newcastle United on 18 December was a late {{postponement}} because of heavy snowfall, and the away game at Everton was called off on Boxing Day morning when <b>frozen</b> <b>pipes</b> within Goodison Park burst. In Birmingham's last match of 2010, Manchester United scored {{after an hour}} through Dimitar Berbatov, but in the 89th minute, Žigić appeared to foul Rio Ferdinand as he controlled Johnson's cross with his arm, touching it on to Bowyer who equalised from an arguably offside position.|$|R
50|$|On 30 November, JAXA {{announced}} that control and communication with Hayabusa had been restored, but a problem remained with the craft's reaction control system, perhaps involving a <b>frozen</b> <b>pipe.</b> Mission control was working {{to resolve the}} problem before the craft's upcoming launch window for return to Earth. On December 6, Hayabusa was 550 km from Itokawa. JAXA {{held a press conference}} about the situation so far. On 27 November, the probe experienced a power outage when trying altitude correction, probably due to a fuel leakage. On 2 December, an altitude correction was attempted, but the thruster did not generate enough force. On 3 December, the probe's Z-axis was found to be 20 to 30 degrees from the Sun direction and increasing. On 4 December, as an emergency measure, xenon propellant from the ion engines was blown to correct the spin, and it was confirmed successful. Altitude control was commanded using the xenon gas. On 5 December, altitude was corrected enough to regain communication through the medium gain antenna. Telemetry was obtained and analyzed. As the result of telemetry analysis, it was found that there was a strong possibility that the sampler projectile had not penetrated when it landed on 25 November. Due to the power outage, the telemetry log data was faulty. On 8 December, a sudden altitude change was observed, and communication with Hayabusa was lost. It was thought likely that the turbulence was caused by evaporation of 8 or 10cc of leaked fuel. This forced a wait of a month or two for Hayabusa to stabilize by conversion of precession to pure rotation, after which the rotation axis needed to be directed toward the Sun and Earth within a specific angular range. The probability of achieving this was estimated at 60% by December 2006, 70% by spring 2007.|$|E
40|$|Pipe {{freezing}} {{has become}} well established in {{industry as a}} method of short-term isolation in order to carry out maintenance or repairs. A temporary plug is formed by freezing the contents of the pipe (usually water although other fluids, including glycols and hydrocarbons, are possible) over a short length. A review of related research and theory showed that there was little published work on pipe freezing and so a 3 phase experimental investigation was developed to with the aim of increasing knowledge in this field. Phase 1 was to investigate the possibility of using the pipe freezing technique to form an ice plug within a polymer (PVDF) pipe. One side of the plug would then be pressurised to test if the ice plug could be used as temporary pipe isolation. Upon completion, it was found that a pressure retaining ice plug could be formed within the section of pipe and that the pipe showed no obvious signs of damage. Phase 2 was to investigate if a solid ice plug could be formed in a selection of polymer pipes using liquid nitrogen as the coolant, without causing permanent deformation or other damage to the pipes. Secondary objectives of the experiments were to determine, the time taken for ice plugs to form and if the ice plugs could support a 10 bar differential pressure. During these experiments, the method of plug formation within the pipe was observed and the inner and outer pipe wall temperatures recorded with the aim of explaining fully the processes involved in the formation of ice plugs within polymer pipes. On completion of the experiments, it was found that, in most cases it was possible to form ice plugs without apparent damage to the pipes. Phase 3 was to investigate the mechanisms by which the ice plug is retained within the pipe and quantify the force needed to remove a fully formed ice core from a <b>frozen</b> <b>pipe</b> section. Upon completion, {{it was found that the}} interaction of the differing rates of contraction between the ice, metallic pipe and the polymer pipes and the adhesive properties between the ice core and pipe wall were extremely difficult to quantify...|$|E

50|$|On Wednesday, {{authorities}} in Juárez announced that convoys would be traveling out to remote regions and slum areas {{to ensure that}} citizens are warm and have the supplies {{they need to get}} through the next few days. On Thursday, Mexican officials suspended energy exports to Texas, citing cold weather damage at five power stations across Mexico that resulted in a total loss of 1,000 megawatts of electricity in Northern Mexico. Power stations in Mexico were able to meet the resulting energy demands in Northern Mexico, but could not spare additional electricity to aid Texas. In Juarez, overnight temperatures in the single digits left 90% of the city without water service due to <b>frozen</b> <b>pipes,</b> and the failure of thermoelectric generators at a power station in Samalayuca, 30 miles south of Juarez, left citizens without power for roughly five hours.|$|R
50|$|For {{two decades}} Tantalus {{produced}} hundreds of experiments {{and was a}} testing ground for many synchrotron techniques still in use. Current synchrotron facilities can be very large, while Tantalus was not, and its small building, even after the 1972 expansion, was crowded with equipment and researchers. Users worked in very close quarters and the close proximity combined with the relative isolation of the facility, made cross fertilization of ideas unavoidable. The atmosphere was open, friendly, and informal, although not particularly comfortable physically, The heating system in one washroom did not work, so, to avoid <b>frozen</b> <b>pipes,</b> users just left the door wide open. After someone posted a sign alerting users to the policy, an international contest began, with each person translating the message into theirown language. A copy of this sign was included {{as part of an}} NSF funding request as evidence of Tantalus's growing international impact.|$|R
50|$|The Uptown Theatre {{has been}} closed to regular events since the winter of 1981 when, due to the owner -- Plitt Theatres -- having turned off the heat, a <b>frozen</b> water <b>pipe</b> burst and caused {{extensive}} damage to the interior.

5000|$|Lee Dae-ho (Kim Sang-kyung) is {{a single}} father and manager of the 120 story luxurious {{landmark}} building complex, Tower Sky in Yeouido, Seoul. He is an earnest employee liked by his colleagues and is secretly in love and secretly even wanted to marry with Seo Yoon-hee (Son Ye-jin), a restaurant manager. The owner of the complex, Mr. Jo decides to hold a [...] "White Christmas" [...] party for tenants and VIPs on Christmas Eve, with helicopters circling above with huge lights attached below them, sprinkling snow onto the party. Dae-ho has promised {{to spend the day}} at an amusement park with his daughter Ha-na, but had to cancel when he is needed at the party. However, the building has faulty water sprinklers due to <b>frozen</b> <b>pipes,</b> but Mr. Cha, the Tower Skys safety section head, is more concerned for the party than any possible architectural errors within the building, despite warnings from his fellow employers about these errors. (One example of their warnings is when cook Young-cheol (Jeon Bae-soo) accidentally leaves a stove on for too long and causes a minor fire.) Young-cheo is in love with a receptionist within the building named Min-jung, and even sneaks out of the kitchen while on duty to make her an ice cream. Meanwhile, Lee Seon-woo (Do Ji-han) is a rookie fireman entering the Yeouido Fire Station. When he gets accepted, he learns that many of the firefighters get more breaks than actual firefighting. In a prank to fool Seon-woo, the other firefighters ring the fire alarm for the squad to assemble while he takes a shower, causing him to appear in front of his entire team naked, much to the other firefighters and even his own pleasure as they put his helmet on him for the first time.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, {{the first}} year of pipelaying, Alyeska set a goal of {{completing}} 45 percent of the 800-mile route. This would not be laid in a straight line, since it was expected that river crossings would take longer to complete than portions of the pipeline on dry land. Work on the pumping stations and the Valdez Marine Terminal, which had begun in the fall of 1974, also was expected to take longer than laying pipe. Conversely, work on those two projects could proceed during the winter, when pipelaying could not take place due to the <b>frozen</b> ground.Laying <b>pipe</b> took several stages. First, the right of way had to be cleared with chainsaws, bulldozers, and scrapers who followed the rough route laid out by the initial surveyors. These crews were followed by another group of surveyors and engineers who determined whether the pipeline could be laid in the planned spot, or if it had to be moved because of permafrost, soft ground, or other considerations. State and federal surveillance officers, working with the engineers, could give the OK to move the path of the pipeline as much as 200 feet to the right or left in order to avoid obstacles.|$|R
5000|$|Less {{likely to}} burst from freezing. The general {{position}} is that PEX plastic materials are slower to burst than copper or PVC pipes, but that they will burst eventually since freezing causes water to expand. One account suggested that PEX water-filled <b>pipes,</b> <b>frozen</b> over time, will swell and tear; in contrast, copper pipe [...] "rips" [...] and PVC [...] "shatters". Home expert Steve Maxwell suggested in 2007 that PEX water-filled pipes could endure [...] "five or six freeze-thaw cycles without splitting" [...] while copper would split apart promptly on the first freeze. In new unheated seasonal homes, it is still recommended to drain pipes during an unheated cold season or take other measures to prevent pipes from bursting because of the cold. In new construction, {{it is recommended that}} all water pipes be sloped slightly to permit drainage, if necessary.|$|R
40|$|Wind washing is {{a general}} term {{referring}} to diminished thermal control caused by air movement over or through a thermal barrier. The primary focus {{of this paper is}} towards a specific type of wind washing where wind can push attic air into the floor cavity between first and second stories of the home through ineffective (or missing) air barriers separating attic space from the floor cavity. A second type of wind washing studied in this project involved insulation batts on knee walls where space between the batts and the wall board allowed air movement against the gypsum wall board. During hot weather, the first type of wind washing pushes hot air into the floor cavity (between the first and second stories) thereby heating ceiling, floor, and interior wall surfaces (see Figures 1 and 2). Condensation may occur on cold supply duct surfaces within the floor cavity resulting in ceiling moisture damage. In cold climates, cold air from wind washing can chill surfaces within the interior floor space and result in <b>frozen</b> water <b>pipes.</b> Through the summer of 2009, a field study tested thirty-two two-story homes and found significant wind washing potential in 40 % of the homes. Part I of this paper will highlight the evaluation methods used and the extent of wind washing found in this study. Repairs and energy monitoring were completed in six of these homes to evaluate retrofit methods and cost effectiveness of retrofit solutions. These results are discussed in Part II of this paper.
