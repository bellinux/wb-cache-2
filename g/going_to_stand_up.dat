500|$|Beginning in August, several {{professional}} athletes {{have participated in}} the 2016 U.S. national anthem protests. The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. During a post-game interview he explained his position stating, [...] "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder," [...] a protest widely interpreted as in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests have generated mixed reactions, and have since spread to other U.S. sports leagues.|$|E
500|$|I'm {{proud of}} my service to this country. If you love your country, you serve her. During a time of war, {{during a time of}} {{economic}} hardship, when asked to serve your country in a sensitive position where you can actually bring a background to help your nation, I'm the kind of person who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> and do it, and I'll take that philosophy to my grave... In terms of the stimulus you talked about, it was failed. [...] And {{let me tell you what}} I talked about with respect to the stimulus. I talked about the need for more tax cuts in the stimulus... We had done historic tax cuts. We created a flat tax in the state of Utah, exactly what needs to happen in this country. We got the economy moving. We became the number-one job creator in this nation and the best managed state. That's exactly what needs to happen in this nation. I am running on my record, and I am proud to run on my record.|$|E
500|$|The {{redesign}} of the obverse {{has led to}} an enduring myth that the breast was covered up out of prudishness, or in response to public outcry. [...] Breen stated that [...] "through their Society for the Suppression of Vice, the guardians of prudery at once began exerting political pressure on the Treasury Department to revoke authorization for these 'immoral' coins". [...] Ron Guth and Jeff Garrett, in their book on US coins by type, aver that the covering up of Liberty was [...] "a change never authorized by MacNeil". [...] Numismatic historian David Lange concedes that {{there is no evidence of}} outcry from the public, but suggests that the decision to change the coin was [...] "more likely prompted by objections from the Treasury Department". Numismatist Ray Young, in his 1979 article in Coins magazine about the quarter, suggested that the redesign [...] "came from the symbolism. [...] If Liberty was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> to her foes, she should do so protected—not 'naked to her enemies.' Thus the war probably had much more to do with the change than any alleged 'public indignation.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Parks moved, but {{toward the}} window seat; she did not get up {{to move to the}} redesignated colored section. Parks later said about being asked to move {{to the rear of the}} bus, [...] "I thought of Emmett Till and I just couldn't go back." [...] Blake said, [...] "Why don't you stand up?" [...] Parks responded, [...] "I don't think I should have to stand up." [...] Blake called the police to arrest Parks. When recalling the {{incident}} for Eyes on the Prize, a 1987 public television series on the Civil Rights Movement, Parks said, [...] "When he saw me still sitting, he asked if I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up,</b> and I said, 'No, I'm not.' And he said, 'Well, if you don't stand up, I'm going to have to call the police and have you arrested.' I said, 'You may do that.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Djali Zwan, an {{acoustic}} incarnation of Zwan, which also featured cellist Ana Lenchantin, was to film {{and record the}} making of a new album in the studio in the fall of 2003, with an album and DVD to be issued in early 2004. Corgan spoke with Rolling Stone about his plans: [...] "We're going to do it Let It Be-style," [...] Corgan said, referring to the documentary about the 1970 Beatles album. [...] "The album would be recorded live, with the cameras rolling. When you get the DVD, you can watch the takes on the album being done." [...] He described the songs he'd written for Djali Zwan as [...] "more folk-driven, rooted in traditional music. I don't want to compromise veins of material to fit into an electric band, which I often did in the Pumpkins. With Djali Zwan, I can write {{an acoustic}} song and not worry how it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> against some rock epic." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2008, Empire of the Sun issued {{their debut}} single, [...] "Walking on a Dream", which peaked at No.10 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The second single, [...] "We Are the People", {{followed}} in September with the parent album released in October. The album reached No.6 on the ARIA Albums Chart. In February 2009, Littlemore told Linda McGee of Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) that Empire of the Sun planned to tour in August {{but not as}} a group [...] "this is not a band project. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> there with guitar, bass, drums and a keyboard player and just play our songs out in a merry Indie kind of way". He described a more theatrical presentation, [...] "I've just finished {{the first draft of}} the script and it's going {{to be more of a}} play, for want of a better term. So at the moment we've got people working in China building inflatable sets and all kinds of things and we're working with some theatre directors in London". However, from April to September that year, Steele could not contact Littlemore. From September Empire of the Sun, without Littlemore, performed live tours of Australia.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2012, after Republican {{presidential nominee}} Mitt Romney lost the presidential {{election}} to Barack Obama, Nuxoll called upon states that supported Romney [...] "to refuse {{to participate in the}} Electoral College" [...] in an bid to reverse the election result and have Romney become president. The notion, which originated in a blog post by Tea Party Nation founder Judson Phillips, was viewed as highly unlikely. [...] Constitutional scholar David Adler of Boise State University said that the idea was [...] "really a strange and bizarre fantasy" [...] and was based on a misreading of the Twelfth Amendment. Nuxoll dismissed the criticism, accused Obama of [...] "depriving us of our freedoms by all the agencies," [...] and stated [...] "what I'm thinking is the states are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> for our individual rights and for our collective rights." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Mike Minerva, a Tallahassee {{public defender}} {{and member of}} the defense team, a pre-trial plea bargain was {{negotiated}} in which Bundy would plead guilty to killing Levy, Bowman and Leach in exchange for a firm 75-year prison sentence. Prosecutors were amenable to a deal, by one account, because [...] "prospects of losing at trial were very good." [...] Bundy, on the other hand, saw the plea deal not only as a means of avoiding the death penalty, but also as a [...] "tactical move": he could enter his plea, then wait a few years for evidence to disintegrate or become lost and for witnesses to die, move on, or retract their testimony. Once the case against him had deteriorated beyond repair, he could file a post-conviction motion to set aside the plea and secure an acquittal. At the last minute, however, Bundy refused the deal. [...] "It made him realize he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> {{in front of the whole}} world and say he was guilty", Minerva said. [...] "He just couldn't do it." ...|$|R
5000|$|After Packard {{witnesses}} Keri kissing Jake, he kidnaps {{her from}} the burger joint and beats and kicks Billy {{when he tries to}} intervene. When Packard tells her they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> California, Keri <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> him and says she will never love him. Just as he {{gets out of the car}} and draws his flick knife, the Turbo arrives and Packard takes up the challenge, only to be killed too. Sheriff Loomis calls off the hunt for the mysterious driver, observing, [...] "You can't stop something that can't be stopped”.|$|R

60|$|By {{the time}} they had taken off their upper {{garments}} a crowd had assembled. The news that a hawker was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> against Black Jim circulated rapidly, and caused intense excitement. To the astonishment of the spectators, the bully from the first had not a shadow of a chance, {{and at the end of}} the third round was carried away senseless, while the hawker had not received a scratch. A few days later Mark, who, on the strength of his prowess, had had two or three hints that he could be put up to a good thing if he was inclined to join, was going down to Westminster when two men stopped and looked after him.|$|E
5000|$|Larry made an {{appearance}} in Season 1 of Static Shock {{in the first}} episode, [...] "Shock to the System". He is only called Wade instead of Larry Wade. Wade attempted to get Virgil to join his gang. Giving him a gun and telling him to join at the city docks, Wade was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> help Virgil <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his problems with Francis [...] "F-Stop" [...] Stone who became 'Hotstreak'.

[...] "He just couldn't do it."At trial, crucial testimony came from Chi Omega sorority members Connie Hastings, who placed Bundy in the vicinity of the Chi Omega House that evening, and Nita Neary, who saw him leaving the sorority house clutching the oak murder weapon. Incriminating physical evidence included impressions of the bite wounds Bundy had inflicted on Lisa Levy's left buttock, which forensic odontologists Richard Souviron and Lowell Levine matched to castings of Bundy's teeth. The jury deliberated for less than seven hours before convicting him on July 24, 1979 of the Bowman and Levy murders, three counts of attempted first degree murder (for the assaults on Kleiner, Chandler and Thomas) and two counts of burglary. Trial judge Edward Cowart imposed death sentences for the murder convictions.|$|R
60|$|The Lancashire Brigade {{advanced}} {{on a wide}} front. Norcott's Riflemen {{were already}} prolonging their line to the right. The Boer fire was dispersed along the whole front of attack, instead of converging on one narrow column. The assault was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> succeed. We <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> on our rocks. Bayonets began to glitter on the distant slope. The moving lines increased their pace. The heads of the Boers bobbing {{up and down in}} their trenches grew fewer and fewer. They knew the tide was running too strongly. Death and flight were thinning their ranks. Then the sky-line of Railway Hill bristled with men, who dropped on their knees forthwith and fired in particular haste at something that was running away down the other side. There was the sound of cheering. Railway Hill was ours. I looked to the left.|$|R
6000|$|Such is the humiliating Situation {{in which}} I am forced to appear while riding in her Ladyship's Coach--I dare not be impertinent, as my Mother is always admonishing {{me to be}} humble and patient if I wish to make my way in the world. She insists on my {{accepting}} every invitation of Lady Greville, or you may be certain that I would never enter either her House, or her Coach with the disagreable certainty I always have of being abused for my Poverty while I am in them.--When we arrived at Ashburnham, it was nearly ten o'clock, which was {{an hour and a}} half later than we were desired to be there; but Lady Greville is too fashionable (or fancies herself to be so) to be punctual. The Dancing however was not begun as they waited for Miss Greville. I had not been long in the room before I was engaged to dance by Mr Bernard, but just as we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up,</b> he recollected that his Servant had got his white Gloves, and immediately ran out to fetch them. In the mean time the Dancing began and Lady Greville in passing to another room went exactly before me--She saw me and instantly stopping, said to me though there were several people close to us, ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{we arrived}} {{it was already}} time for dinner so we went downstairs to it at once. The dining-room was {{underground}} in the basement. It was very crowded and stuffy, {{and there was a}} great clatter of dishes and a heavy smell of food. Most of the people were already seated, but there was an empty place at the head of one of the tables and Uncle William moved straight towards that. Uncle was wearing, as I said, his frock coat and his celluloid collar and he walked into the room with quite an air, in something of the way that he used to come into the great hall of the Neues Palais at Potsdam, only that in these clothes it looked different. As Uncle entered the room he waved his hand and said, [...] "Let no one rise!" [...] I remember that when Uncle said this at the big naval dinner at Kiel it made a great sensation as an example of his ready tact. He realised that if they had once risen there would have been great difficulty in their order of procedure for sitting down again. He was afraid that the same difficulty might have been felt here in the boarding house. But I don't think it would, and I don't think that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up,</b> anyway. They just went on eating. I noticed one cheap-looking young man watching Uncle with a sort of half smile as he moved towards his seat. I heard him say to his neighbour, [...] "Some scout, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll catch it!" [...] {{she said}} impressively. But here her brother's {{nervousness}} broke {{out into a}} weak, impotent fury. It was evident, too, {{that in spite of}} its apparent spontaneous irritation its intent was studied. Catch it! Would he? Oh, yes! Well, she'd see WHO'D catch it! Not him. No, he'd had enough of this meanness, and wanted it ended! He wasn't a woman to be treated like his sister,--like their mother--like their brother, if it came to that, for he knew how he was to be brought back to take Bijah's place in the spring; he'd heard the whole story. No, he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> for his rights,--he was going to be treated as the son {{of a man who was}} worth half a million ought to be treated! He wasn't going to be skimped, while his father was wallowing in money that he didn't know what to do with,--money that by rights ought to have been given to their mother and their sister. Why, even the law wouldn't permit such meanness--if he was dead. No, he'd come back with Lottie, his wife, to show his father that there was one of the family that couldn't be fooled and bullied, and wouldn't put up with it any longer. There was going to be a fair division of the property, and his sister Annie's property, and hers--Zuleika's--too, if she'd have the pluck to speak up for herself. All this and much more he said. Yet even while his small fury was genuine and characteristic, there was such an evident incongruity between himself and his speech that it seemed to fit him loosely, and in a measure flapped in his gestures like another's garment. Zuleika, who had exhibited neither disgust nor sympathy with his rebellion, but had rather appeared to enjoy it as a novel domestic performance, the morality of which devolved solely upon the performer, retained her curious smile. And then a knock at the door startled them.|$|E

She goes out into the jungle and retrieves the serum, but Sayid and Sawyer have followed her, and they want answers. Juliet tells them there is no time, and realizing they are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> budge, she <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them and says she finds it interesting {{that they are the}} camp's moral police, considering their violent pasts. She takes the serum back to the beach and gives it to Jack. He warns her that if anything happens to Claire, he {{will not be able to}} protect her against the will of the survivors any longer and she would be alone, to which Juliet states that she already is. At the camp, Claire wakes up. She is feeling and looking much better. Juliet is now on the path to being trusted by the survivors. Jack brings her supplies to set up her tent area and tells her eventually everyone will need answers. Juliet asks why Jack trusts her and does not ask for answers. He says because when the submarine exploded, he saw in her eyes that she wanted to get off this island more than anything. That makes her [...] "one of us." ...|$|R
