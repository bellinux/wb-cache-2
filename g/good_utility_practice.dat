An extensive literature review was conducted to determine the underground <b>utility</b> <b>practices,</b> locating technologies, data management practice, as well as education and outreach programs. This literature review synthesized the practices form other industries. The practices from water and wastewater utilities were determined by the help of participation utilities to the WATERiD Database. Case studies in locating technology applications and locating practice application was written to capture these practices. These case studies were also supplemented by phone interviews with various utilities. Comparison between the literature and <b>utility</b> <b>practice</b> indicated various gaps in the <b>utility</b> <b>practice.</b> Recommendations are offered to fill these gaps for an effective use of underground <b>utility</b> <b>practices</b> by water and wastewater utilities. These recommendation include adaptation and implementation of specific best practices of transportation industry by the water and wastewater utilities. Specifically, adaptations of; standards, decision support tools for data quality levels and locating technologies, data standardization and integration, as well as participation on education and outreach programs are discussed...|$|R
