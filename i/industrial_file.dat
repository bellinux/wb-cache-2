Conducted effective structure analysis model according to international basic-class <b>industrial</b> <b>file</b> and se-lect targeted information data. The angle and prospectiveness of model analysis {{can be developed}} continuously so that an-ti-seismic and collapse-resistance ability of building structure can be strengthened constantly. Relevant sub-model trans-fers various information data {{in order to improve}} accuracy of model data analysis. Finite Element Analysis Software and Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation positively promote constructing {{information model}}; at the same time, they actively strengthen digital construction of model, reasonability and systematicness of information data analysis. Wish this study can provide useful data and theory support for further exploring work. Hope building information model can be applied more in enhancing anti-seismic and collapse-resistance ability of building structure...|$|E
40|$|While {{there is}} a general {{impression}} expressed by many in the media and among policy makers that the economy is becoming more globalized and internationally competitive, these claims are not agreed upon among economists. This dissertation attempts to clarify the validity of these crucial claims through empirical research. ^ This dissertation focusses on one aspect of economic internationalization and integration [...] the behavior of U. S. multinational manufacturing corporations and their foreign direct investment activities. The research presented here attempts to test two main hypotheses; first, that the extent of internationalization within U. S. manufacturing firms has grown in the recent past and, second, that production abroad by U. S. manufacturers substitutes for production in the domestic U. S. economy by these firms. ^ Using industry data from the Department of Commerce Surveys of U. S. Direct Investment Abroad, this dissertation supports the view of growing globalization by U. S. manufacturing multinational firms in the period from the late 1970 s through the 1980 s as measured by a range of measures. In particular, the data show that slow or non-existent domestic production growth combined with steady growth in foreign production to result in increased internationalization for these firms. The Department of Commerce data is also consistent with the claim that U. S. multinational manufacturing firms are increasingly substituting away from their domestic production base towards production in foreign countries in response to lower factor costs abroad. ^ Next, merging the Compustat <b>Industrial</b> <b>File</b> and the Compustat Geographic Segment File allowed the construction of a unique cross-section, time-series data set of 123 U. S. manufacturing multinational firms. Employing this firm level data, regression analysis is used to test if foreign production growth by U. S. manufacturing firms represents a substitution away from domestic production. Results of the analysis suggest that whether increased internationalization will displace domestic growth for a U. S. manufacturing firm is dependent on the degree of indebtedness of the firm and the concentration of its foreign operations in low wage areas of the world. For the high debt firms in the sample, the substitution effect of foreign growth on domestic growth outweighs the stimulating effect, while the opposite is true for less indebted firms. Regression analysis also shows a tendency for foreign affiliate growth to substitute for domestic growth when the firm 2 ̆ 7 s foreign operations are concentrated in developing countries, a result consistent with the analysis of the Department of Commerce data described above. ...|$|E

In order to get full acoustic images by preventing the false alarm, we use the projection algorithm and achieved good results. Finally we do the bottom wave and defect wave detection on the acoustic image, and realize the recognition of defect automatically.

40|$|This study evaluates 2 ̆ 2 {{environmental}} equity 2 ̆ 2 in {{the residential}} distribution of commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities (TSDFs). Because of claims that TSDFs are disproportionately sited in poor and black neighborhoods, this area of research has become important to scholars, policymakers and community activists. Indeed, claims have generated significant changes in U. S. environmental policy, including the Environmental Protection Agency 2 ̆ 7 s (EPA 2 ̆ 7 s) establishment of the Office of Environmental Justice, several remedial Congressional bills and an Executive Order from President Clinton mandating Federal Agencies consider environmental justice issues. Yet empirical analyses are limited. ^ Beyond a comprehensive literature review and a theoretical summary, this study contributes two broad analyses. First is a comprehensive cross-sectional analysis of the current distribution of TSDFs. Efforts are directed toward uncovering systematic differences between the demographic composition of neighborhoods with and without TSDFs. Importantly, proxy measures for zoning and market forces in addition to proxy measures of TSDF activity are employed. Second is a longitudinal analysis of TSDF siting focused on whether the composition of neighborhoods is systematically related to site selection decisions {{at the time of}} siting. Further analyses aim to find out if TSDFs significantly impact the demographic composition of host neighborhoods over time. ^ Several data resources are employed. TSDF data were primarily compiled from the Environmental Services Directory, validated through the EPA 2 ̆ 7 s RCRIS data resource and a telephone survey. Neighborhood data come from the 1970, 1980 and 1990 tract-level Census files. Proxy measures of zoning and TSDF activity come from Dunn and Bradstreet <b>industrial</b> firm <b>files</b> and EPA 2 ̆ 7 s 1992 Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), respectively. ^ Analyses reveal no stark evidence of environmental inequity in either the current distribution of TSDFs or longitudinally. Findings suggest TSDF neighborhoods are generally white, working-class, industrial neighborhoods [...] a finding consistent with some theories of urban structure and some previous research. More active TSDFs appear to be located in neighborhoods with smaller percentages of minority and poor persons. Simple conclusions are complicated by evidence suggesting TSDF neighborhoods are surrounded by poor and minority neighborhoods and other methodological obstacles, however. Implications for policy and research are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|A Knowledge-Based System (KBS) is {{essentially}} an intelligent computer system which explicitly or tacitly possesses a knowledge repository that helps the system solve problems. Researches focusing on building KBSs for industrial applications to improve design quality and shorten research cycle are increasingly attracting interests. For the early models, explanability is considered {{as one of the}} major benefits of using KBSs since that most of them are generally rule-based systems and the explanation can be generated based on the rule traces of the reasoning behaviors. With the development of KBS, the definition of knowledge base is becoming much more general than just using rules, and the techniques used to solve problems in KBS are far more than just rule-based reasoning. Many Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques are introduced, such as neural network, genetic algorithm, etc. The effectiveness and efficiency of KBS are thus improved. However, as a trade-off, the explanability of KBS is weakened. More and more KBSs are conceived as black-box systems that do not run transparently to users, resulting in loss of trusts for the KBSs. Developing an explanation model for modern KBSs has a positive impact on user acceptance of the KBSs and the advices they provided. This thesis proposes a novel computational framework for explanation generation in KBS. Different with existing models which are usually built inside a KBS and generate explanations based on the actual decision making process, the explanation model in our framework stands outside the KBS and attempts to generate explanations through the production of an alternative justification that is unrelated to the actual decision making process used by the system. In this case, the knowledge and reasoning approaches in the explanation model can be optimized specially for explanation generation. The quality of explanation is thus improved. Another contribution in this study is that the system aims to cover three types of explanations (where most of the existing models only focus on the first two) : 1) decision explanation, which helps users understand how a KBS reached its conclusion; 2) domain explanation, which provides detailed descriptions of the concepts and relationships within the domain; 3) software diagnostic, which diagnoses user observations of unexpected behaviors of the system or some relevant domain phenomena. The framework is demonstrated with a case of Automated Feature Recognition (AFR). The resulting explanatory system uses Semantic Web languages to implement an individual knowledge base only for explanatory purpose, and integrates a novel reasoning approach for generating explanations. The system is tested with an <b>industrial</b> STEP <b>file,</b> and delivers good quality explanations for user queries about how a certain feature is recognized...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Business Structure Database (BSD) contains {{a small number of}} variables for almost all business organisations in the UK. The BSD is derived primarily from the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR), which is a live register of data collected by HM Revenue and Customs via VAT and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records. The IDBR data are complimented with data from ONS business surveys. If a business is liable for VAT (turnover exceeds the VAT threshold) and/or has at least one member of staff registered for the PAYE tax collection system, then the business will appear on the IDBR (and hence in the BSD). In 2004 it was estimated that the businesses listed on the IDBR accounted for almost 99 per cent of economic activity in the UK. Only very small businesses, such as the self-employed were not found on the IDBR. The IDBR is frequently updated, and contains confidential information that cannot be accessed by non-civil servants without special permission. However, the ONS Virtual Micro-data Laboratory (VML) created and developed the BSD, which is a 'snapshot' in time of the IDBR, in order to provide a version of the IDBR for research use, taking full account of changes in ownership and restructuring of businesses. The 'snapshot' is taken around April, and the captured point-in-time data are supplied to the VML by the following September. The reporting period is generally the financial year. For example, the 2000 BSD file is produced in September 2000, using data captured from the IDBR in April 2000. The data will reflect the financial year of April 1999 to March 2000. However, the ONS may, during this time, update the IDBR with data on companies from its own business surveys, such as the Annual Business Survey (SN 7451). The Business Structure Database Longitudinal, 1997 - 2013 was compiled by Michael Anyadike-Danes, Aston Business School, with support from Economic and Social Research Council funding. Researchers are advised to read the documentation accompanying the main BSD collection held by the UK Data Archive under SN 6697 before applying for or using the longitudinal data. Linking to other business studies These data contain IDBR reference numbers. These are anonymous but unique reference numbers assigned to business organisations. Their inclusion allows researchers to combine different business survey sources together. Researchers may consider applying for other business data to assist their research.
