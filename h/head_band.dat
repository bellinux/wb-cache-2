25|$|Soon after, the tyrannical {{power of}} the foreign King in Italy spurred a revolt, {{especially}} around Catania and southern Sicily, which his German soldiers led by Markward of Annweiler and Henry of Kalden suppressed mercilessly. The rebels even sought to make Count Jordan of Bovino king in Henry's place. Even Queen Constance, provoked by the neglect of Henry and pitying her countrymen, joined the revolts against him and besieged him in a castle, forcing him into a treaty. In the midst of preparations Henry fell ill with chills while hunting near Fiumedinisi and on 28 September died, possibly of malaria, in Messina, although it is also widely believed that he was poisoned. His wife Constance had him buried at Messina, his mortal remains were transferred to Palermo Cathedral in 1198. Various items were removed from Henry VI's grave in the mid nineteenth century, some of which {{made their way to}} the British Museum in London.

[...] The Norway House Band (Kinosao Sipi Cree Nation) agreed to settle at Fisher River. [...] Norway House Band was a Western Woods Cree community of the Algonquian (Central) language group. [...] The Sandy Bar group wanted also a reserve in the Grassey Narrows area. [...] Their settlement area was on {{the northern edge of}} New Iceland. The Sandy Bar saulteaux/Cree of the Algonquian (Central) language group may have been a portion of the Peguis-St. Peters Band. [...] This group was almost entirely decimated during the smallpox epidemic, those who were left were re-located. [...] The Island band requested a reserve on Big Island (later renamed Hecla Island). [...] This band settled at Hollow Water River and renounced the traditional lands at Big Island. [...] Blood Vein River, Big Island, Sandy Bar, Thickfoot and Jack-Fish Head bands met with Messrs.

2500|$|Shield Jaguar was {{a central}} figure in {{directing}} the course of Yaxchilan. [...] Shield Jaguar ascended to power in AD 681 and died in AD 742. There are numerous documented references to him on artifacts {{at the end of}} Stage V at Yaxchilan. In Lintel 24, he is depicted holding a torch above his first wife, Lady Xoc. The king is wearing his hair back with quetzal feathers indicating that he will also let blood in this ceremony. [...] Attached to his <b>head</b> <b>band</b> is {{what appears to be a}} representation of the Jester Mask. The jester mask is considered analogous to the glyph for kingship, ajaw, and is named so for the vegetation often depicted coming from the crown of it. Since the rest of the costume is depicted without much abstraction, it is suggested that Maya kings may have literally attached a shrunken head to their <b>head</b> <b>band</b> as a representation of power. He is shown wearing a pectoral with a representation of the sun god depicted. [...] It is strung from a jade bead necklace that is counterbalanced by a long strand of jade beads and what are probably carved shells going down his back. The artist was careful to show such minute details as the strings that are tied to hold on the wrist cuffs worn by both royals, and the pattern woven on Shield Jaguar’s beautiful cape.|$|E

Blood scrolls can be seen on her face. [...] The queen also wears an elaborate headdress. There are flower tassels on the main part of the <b>head</b> <b>band</b> and a mosaic depiction of Tlaloc sprouting quetzal feathers. Her elaborately carved huipil is trimmed with fringe and pearls. Her necklace also appears to have a pectoral depiction of the sun god. [...] It is probably made of shell or jade plaques, as are her wrist cuffs.|$|E
2500|$|The game {{marked the}} debuts of Amy Rose and Metal Sonic, both {{designed}} by artist Kazuyuki Hoshino. Although the final in-game Amy graphics {{were created by}} Hoshino, many staff members contributed ideas to her design. Her <b>head</b> <b>band</b> and trainer shoes reflected Oshshima's tastes while her mannerisms reflected the traits Hoshino looked for in women at the time. Metal Sonic was designed in response to Ohshima wanting a strong rival to Sonic. Hoshino had a clear image of the character in his mind {{from the moment he}} was briefed, and Metal Sonic's design emerged after only a few sketches. The character graphics were created using Sega's own proprietary graphics system for the Genesis called the [...] "Sega Digitizer MK-III". The suite featured a bitmap and animation editor. The prevalent computers they used at the time were Macintosh IIci. Graphics data was stored on 3.5-inch floppy disks which were handed off to the programmer to work into the game.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sound of}} the Moog [...] reached the mass market with Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends in 1968 and The Beatles' Abbey Road the {{following}} year; hundreds of other popular recordings subsequently used synthesizers, most famously the portable Minimoog. [...] Electronic music albums by Beaver and Krause, Tonto's Expanding <b>Head</b> <b>Band,</b> The United States of America, and White Noise reached a sizable cult audience and progressive rock musicians such as Richard Wright of Pink Floyd and Rick Wakeman of Yes were soon using the new portable synthesizers extensively. Stevie Wonder and Herbie Hancock [...] also played a [...] major role in popularising synthesizers in Black American music. Other early users included Emerson, Lake & Palmer's Keith Emerson, Tony Banks of Genesis, Todd Rundgren, Pete Townshend, and The Crazy World of Arthur Brown's Vincent Crane.

2500|$|In his {{appraisal}} of Harrison's solo career for Mojo in 2011, John Harris described the album as [...] "Fabdom's answer to Metal Machine Music", adding: [...] "Not exactly music, though you could conceivably assume the endless whooshes and random notes were {{the work of}} admirably out-there Krautrockers." [...] In his article on the Moog for the same magazine, in 1997, John McCready wrote that the album conveyed [...] "caveman confusion" [...] on Harrison's part, but he grouped it with experimental releases by Jean-Jacques Perrey, Dick Hyman, the Hellers, Mort Garson and TONTO's Expanding <b>Head</b> <b>Band,</b> saying: [...] "It says something about the compelling-even-when-crap nature of the Moog {{that it is possible}} to own and enjoy all these records." [...] Luke Turner of The Quietus includes it among his favourite electronic-music albums. He says that Harrison's fascination with the Moog typified the interest the new instrument received from top rock musicians at the time, and he adds: [...] "Luckily for us he decided to release it (with a great cover painting by a small child) ..." [...] Writing for New York Observer, Ron Hart considers it to be one of Harrison's unjustly overlooked works and he says that while it was tainted by the controversy with Krause, the project stands as an [...] "oddly visionary testament to the Zapple label and its unsung promise to bring the avant-garde to the pop crowd".|$|E
