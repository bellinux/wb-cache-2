A <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> projected normally therefrom, and a second subassembly is adapted to be pivotally mounted on an upwardly facing surface of a tractor.

5000|$|The {{front axle}} is rigid type, with forged beam and {{drop in the}} middle. The <b>king</b> <b>pins</b> are with slide bearing bushings. The axles were {{produced}} by Kirkstall. The suspension consists of 2½" [...] wide and 1 200 mm long half-elliptic leaf springs, with additional auxiliary springs on the rear axle, and telescopic hydraulic double-acting shock absorbers. The wheel size is 7.50 - 16".|$|E
50|$|Drivers {{generally}} found handling on Seddon RUs vague, {{and steering}} imprecise. Geoffrey Hillditch refers to 'a most peculiar feeling' when driving one. Steering bushes, axle thrust pads and <b>king</b> <b>pins</b> were less durable {{than they should}} have been, adding to steering troubles, whilst unbalanced front wheels could cause the steering wheel to wobble. Weight was biased too much toward the rear and this exacerbated handling problems. The polyurethane bushes wore 'alarmingly' and were replaced by traditional (regularly) greased chromium-plated brass units. Springs were not substantial enough.|$|E
50|$|Milkwood was {{the brainchild}} of Louis McKelvey (born on October 31, 1943, in Killorglin, County Kerry, Republic of Ireland), who formed a {{tentative}} line up after he left Montreal group, Influence in late 1968. Through his previous band, McKelvey had befriended former King Curtis sideman, drummer Ron Frankel (born in April 1947 in Montreal), who had previously played in The Soul Mates (and with his wife Mary Lou Gauthier) in the lounge band, Five of a Kind before joining King Curtis & The <b>King</b> <b>Pins</b> in early 1968.|$|E

50|$|Dual-pivot {{steering}} geometry (also known as virtual pivot) is a geometric arrangement of linkages in the steering {{of a car}} designed to reduce or eliminate scrub radius by moving the pivot point of the <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> outboard, {{in order to improve}} steering precision and straight line stability.|$|R
50|$|Longboard {{specific}} {{trucks are}} {{a more recent}} development. A longboard truck has the <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> laid at a more obtuse angle (usually between 38 and 50 degrees) to the deck, giving {{a greater degree of}} turning for the same tilt of the deck. Many longboard specific trucks also have a reverse kingpin arrangement with the kingpins facing outward.|$|R
5000|$|One main {{criticism}} of these drug laws were {{that they put}} young minority males and females behind bars for carrying small amounts of drugs on them.

5000|$|The first Dana 70 {{front axle}} {{was used in}} 1958 by Dodge in the W300, in both 4.88 and 5.87 ratios. International started using Dana 70 front axles in the late 1960s. Both {{companies}} used Dana 70 front axles until the mid-1970s (Dodge W300 pickup up until 1978, discontinued in 1979). All of these Dana 70 front axles were closed knuckle, with <b>king</b> <b>pins</b> and had a GAWR of 6000 lbs. Like the rear Dana 70 axles, the Dana 70 front axle started out with 23 spline axle shafts {{and then went to}} 35 spline axle shafts. While these axles were being manufactured, Dana offered a [...] "Power-Lok" [...] limited slip differential for some of these axles.|$|E
50|$|Harper {{was born}} in Guildford, Surrey, England, but {{relocated}} with his parents to Perth, Western Australia {{at the age of}} 10. In the late 1970s he played in a brass band learning to play the euphonium and trumpet. Further inspired by Stevie Wonder's harmonica playing, Harper was self-taught on the instrument and played in clubs before securing his first recording contract. He had also performed with bands including the <b>King</b> <b>Pins,</b> the Magnificent Seven, West of the Wall, the Flirts, the Mods, and Good Horse before, in the early 1990s, forming Blue Devil. They performed for several years prior to recording their debut album, Tears of Ice, which was released by Newmarket Records. Yesterday Is Over (Shock Records, 1996) followed before Harper parted company with Blue Devil.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{they are}} largely obsolete, kingpin {{suspensions}} {{have the advantage}} of being able to carry much heavier weights, which is why they are still featured on some heavy trucks. Dana produced the <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> version of the D60 axle until 1991. (The functionally analogous, similar looking and very robust joint between the chassis and boom on a backhoe is however referred to as a king post.) ...|$|R
50|$|In the Marvel 1602 {{universe}} (Earth-311), Bull's Eye {{appears as}} an assassin/first mate for the villainous Captain Wilson Fiske (The <b>King's</b> <b>Pin).</b> He is heavily tattooed around {{the face and}} arms, and possesses the mainstream Bullseye's abilities. He is sent by his captain with orders to kill Peter Parquagh aka the 1602 version of Spider-Man. He is attacked by the 1602 version of the Lizard and presumably perishes.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1986 Nick Caramandi {{was arrested}} by the FBI on {{extortion}} charges. He {{was placed in the}} Philadelphia Detention Center, which housed Martorano and his son, George [...] "Cowboy" [...] Martorano. The younger Martorano had built a drug empire believed to be worth $75 million before he was convicted in 1984. Under what was called [...] "the Federal drug <b>king</b> <b>pin</b> statute" [...] he was sentenced to life in prison.|$|R
50|$|Articulated {{steering}} is {{a system}} by which a four-wheel vehicle is split into front and rear halves which are connected by a vertical hinge. The front and rear halves are connected {{with one or more}} hydraulic cylinders that change the angle between the halves, including the front and rear axles and wheels, thus steering the vehicle. This system does not use steering arms, <b>king</b> <b>pins,</b> tie rods, etc. as does four-wheel steering. If the vertical hinge is placed equidistant between the two axles, it also eliminates the need for a central differential, as both front and rear axles will follow the same path, and thus rotate at the same speed. Long road trains, articulated buses, and internal transport trolley trains use articulated steering to achieve smaller turning circles, comparable to those of shorter conventional vehicles. Articulated haulers have very good off-road performance.|$|E
5000|$|The 1941, Nash 600 was {{the first}} mass-produced unibody {{construction}} automobile made in the United States. Its lighter weight compared to body-on-frame automobiles and lower air drag helped it to achieve excellent fuel economy for its day. The [...] "600" [...] model designation {{is said to have}} been derived from overdrive-equipped examples of this car's ability to travel 600 mi on a 20 gal tank of gasoline. In other words, it would achieve 30 mpg. The 600 models used an unusual steering/front suspension system with extremely long <b>king</b> <b>pins.</b> Inadequate lubrication became a problem for these systems, commonly resulting in premature failures. The design of the cars was improved by new front ends, upholstery, and chrome trim from 1942 to 1948. The larger Ambassador models shared the same bodies with the 600 but placed this unibody structure on top of a conventional frame, resulting in an extremely strong car.|$|E
5000|$|The {{equipment}} {{may have}} varied, but an example sold in 1969 was mechanically {{similar to the}} Morgan +4 of the same year. It had the straight 4 pushrod engine of a Triumph TR4A, giving [...] The transmission was 4 speed with synchromesh on 2nd, 3rd and 4th. It also shared the suspension with the +4. In front, it had sliding <b>king</b> <b>pins</b> tilted 17 degrees from the vertical, a development of a 1910 design. This was lubricated by grease and by engine oil released by a button under the clutch pedal. It had coil springs (very hard) and bottoming coils instead of rubber pads. The rear had conventional leaf springs with solid rear axle. There was no perceptible body lean, even when cornering very hard. It had disc brakes in front, drums in the rear, hard pedal pressure with no power assist. The frame was Z section steel rails with structural plywood floor, extended by steel tubes in front.|$|E
