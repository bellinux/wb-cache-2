25|$|The <b>isobutane</b> feed to an {{alkylation}} unit can {{be either}} low or high purity. Low purity makeup <b>isobutane</b> feedstock (typically < 70% vol <b>isobutane)</b> usually originates from the refinery (mainly from the reformer) {{and need to be}} processed in the deisobutanizer (DIB). High purity feedstock (> 95% vol <b>isobutane)</b> normally originates from an external De-isobutanizer (DIB) tower and is fed directly to the alkylation unit reaction zone. Such <b>isobutane</b> feed does not normally contain any significant level of contaminants.|$|E
25|$|The common {{source of}} the C3 alkenes for the {{alkylation}} is made available from the gas recovery unit processing the effluents of the Fluid catalytic cracking Unit. <b>Isobutane</b> is partly made available from the Catalytic reforming and from the Atmospheric distillation, although {{the proportion of the}} <b>isobutane</b> produced in a refinery is rarely sufficient to run the unit at full capacity and additional <b>isobutane</b> needs therefore to be brought to the refinery. The economics of the international and local market of gasolines dictates the spread that a buyer need to pay for <b>isobutane</b> compared to standard commercial butane.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the unit is to react an olefin feed with <b>isobutane</b> in the {{reaction}} section {{in the presence of}} the HF acting as catalyst to produce alkylate. Prior to entering the reaction section, the olefin and <b>isobutane</b> feed are treated in a coalescer to remove water, sulfur and other contaminants.|$|E
25|$|In a {{standard}} oil refinery {{process known as}} alkylation, <b>isobutane</b> is alkylated with low-molecular-weight alkenes (primarily a mixture of propylene and butylene) {{in the presence of}} the strong acid catalyst derived from hydrofluoric acid. The catalyst protonates the alkenes (propylene, butylene) to produce reactive carbocations, which alkylate <b>isobutane.</b> The reaction is carried out at mild temperatures (0 and 30°C) in a two-phase reaction.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} promote the desired {{alkylation}} reactions, which are those involving <b>isobutane</b> and olefins, {{it is necessary to}} maintain a high concentration of <b>isobutane</b> in the reaction zone. Low isobutane-olefin ratios increase the likelihood of olefin-olefi polymerization that will result in lower octane. Polymerization reactions also have a higher rate of production of acid soluble oils, resulting in higher acid consumption.|$|E
25|$|The {{catalyst}} protonates the Alkenes (Propene, Butene) {{to produce}} reactive carbocations, which Alkylate <b>Isobutane.</b> The reaction {{is carried out}} at mild temperatures (0 and 30nbsp&°C) in a two-phase reaction. Because the reaction is exothermic, cooling is needed: SAAU plants require lower temperatures so the cooling medium needs to be chilled, for HFAU normal refinery cooling water will suffice. It {{is important to keep}} a high ratio of <b>Isobutane</b> to Alkene at the point of reaction to prevent side reactions which produces a lower octane product, so the plants have a high recycle of <b>Isobutane</b> back to feed. The phases separate spontaneously, so the acid phase is vigorously mixed with the hydrocarbon phase to create sufficient contact surface.|$|E
25|$|More recent {{refrigerators}} use R600A {{which is}} <b>isobutane,</b> {{and does not}} deplete the ozone and is less harmful to the environment. Dimethyl ether (DME) has also gained in popularity as a refrigerant.|$|E
25|$|Heavier gaseous hydrocarbons: ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), normal butane (n-C4H10), <b>isobutane</b> (i-C4H10), pentanes {{and even}} higher {{molecular}} weight hydrocarbons. When processed and purified into finished by-products, {{all of these}} are collectively referred to as Natural Gas Liquids or NGL.|$|E
25|$|In the {{reaction}} section the reacting hydrocarbons (olefin feed with both fresh and recycled <b>isobutane)</b> are brought {{into contact with}} sulfuric acid catalyst under controlled conditions and at a temperature of 15.6nbsp&°C (60nbsp&°F). The feeds are treated to remove impurities, especially water {{in order to reduce}} corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Normal butane can be {{used for}} {{gasoline}} blending, as a fuel gas, fragrance extraction solvent, either alone or in a mixture with propane, and as a feedstock for the manufacture of ethylene and butadiene, a key ingredient of synthetic rubber. <b>Isobutane</b> is primarily used by refineries to enhance (increase) the octane number of motor gasoline.|$|E
25|$|In the {{fractionation}} section, alkylate {{is separated}} from excess isobutene and acid catalyst through distillation. Unreacted <b>isobutane</b> is recovered and recycled back to the reaction section to mix with the olefin feed. Propane is a major product of the distillation process. Some amount of n-butane that has entered with the feed is also withdrawn as a side product.|$|E
25|$|Research in {{the area}} of a solid {{catalyst}} for alkylation has been ongoing for many years. Numerous patents exist for different catalysts, catalyst supports, and processes. Lewis acids will catalyze the alkylation reaction (alkylation of <b>isobutane</b> with olefins was discovered using aluminum chloride promoted with HCl). Several of the current preferred solid catalysts use a salt of HF: either boron trifluoride (BF3) or antimony pentafluoride (SbF5).|$|E
25|$|The {{gasoline}} {{produced in}} the FCC unit has an elevated octane rating but is less chemically stable compared to other gasoline components due to its olefinic profile. Olefins in gasoline {{are responsible for the}} formation of polymeric deposits in storage tanks, fuel ducts and injectors. The FCC LPG is an important source of C3-C4 olefins and <b>isobutane</b> that are essential feeds for the alkylation process and the production of polymers such as polypropylene.|$|E
25|$|An Alkylation unit {{is one of}} the {{conversion}} processes used in petroleum refineries. It is used to convert <b>isobutane</b> and low-molecular-weight alkenes (primarily a mixture of propene and butene) into alkylate, a high octane gasoline component. The process occurs {{in the presence of a}} strong acting acid such as sulfuric acid or hydrofluoric acid (HF) as catalyst. Depending on the acid used, the unit takes the name of SAAU (Sulphuric Acid Alkylation Unit) or HFAU (Hydrofluoric Acid Alkylation Unit).|$|E
25|$|Polymerization {{results from}} the {{addition}} of a second olefin to the C8 carbocation formed in the primary reaction. The resulting C12 carbocation can continue to react with an olefin to form a larger carbocation. As with the previously described mechanisms, the heavy carbocations may at some point undergo a hydride transfer from <b>isobutane</b> to yield a C12 – C16 isoparaffin and a t-butyl cation. These heavy molecules tend to lower the octane and raise the boiling end point of the alkylate effluent.|$|E
25|$|The {{product of}} the unit, the alkylate, is {{composed}} of a mixture of high-octane, branched-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons (mostly isoheptane and isooctane). Alkylate is a premium gasoline blending stock because it has exceptional antiknock properties and is clean burning. The octane number of the alkylate depends mainly upon the kind of alkenes used and upon operating conditions. For example, isooctane results from combining butylene with <b>isobutane</b> and has an octane rating of 100 by definition. There are other products in the alkylate effluent, however, so the octane rating will vary accordingly.|$|E
25|$|The {{sulfuric acid}} {{present in the}} {{reaction}} zone serves as a catalyst to the alkylation reaction. Theoretically, a catalyst promotes a chemical reaction without being changed {{as a result of}} that reaction. In reality, however, the acid is diluted as a result of the side reactions and feed contaminants. To maintain the desired spent acid strength, a small amount of fresh acid is continuously charged to the acid recycle line from the acid settler to the reactor and an equivalent amount of spent acid is withdrawn from the acid settler. In the fractionation section the unreacted <b>isobutane</b> is recovered for recycle to the reaction section and remaining hydrocarbons are separated into the desired products.|$|E
2500|$|Very pure {{forms of}} butane, {{especially}} <b>isobutane,</b> {{can be used}} as refrigerants and have largely replaced the ozone-layer-depleting halomethanes, for instance in household refrigerators and freezers. The system operating pressure for butane is lower than for the halomethanes, such as R-12, so R-12 systems such as in automotive air conditioning systems, when converted to pure butane will not function optimally and therefore a mix of <b>isobutane</b> and propane is used to give cooling system performance comparable to R-12.|$|E

2500|$|A {{straight-chain}} alkane {{will have}} a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare <b>isobutane</b> (2-methylpropane) and n-butane (butane), which boil at −12 and 0°C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58°C, respectively. For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can [...] "lock" [...] into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfuric acid is {{used for}} a variety of other {{purposes}} in the chemical industry.

Much [...] is used in petroleum refining, for example as a catalyst for the reaction of <b>isobutane</b> with isobutylene to give isooctane, a compound that raises the octane rating of gasoline (petrol). Sulfuric acid is also often used as a dehydrating or oxidising agent in industrial reactions, such as the dehydration of various sugars to form solid carbon.|$|E
2500|$|Butane (...) is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula C4H10 {{that is an}} [...] alkane with four carbon atoms. Butane is a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.

50|$|As a refrigerant, <b>isobutane</b> has an {{explosion}} risk {{in addition to}} the hazards associated with non-flammable CFC refrigerants. Reports surfaced in late 2009 suggesting the use of <b>isobutane</b> as a refrigerant in domestic refrigerators was potentially dangerous.
