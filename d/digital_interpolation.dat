50|$|Movies (shot at 24 frames per second) are {{converted}} to television (roughly 50 or 60 fields per second). To convert a 24 frame/sec movie to 60 field/sec television, for example, alternate movie frames are shown 2 and 3 times, respectively. For 50 Hz {{systems such as}} PAL each frame is shown twice. Since 50 is not exactly 2×24, the movie will run 50/48 = 4% faster, and the audio pitch will be 4% higher, an effect known as PAL speed-up. This is often accepted for simplicity, but more complex methods are possible that preserve the running time and pitch.

Most line doublers use <b>digital</b> <b>interpolation</b> to recreate the missing lines in an interlaced signal, and the resulting quality depends on the technique used. Generally a line doubler will only interpolate within a single field, rather than merging information from adjacent fields, to preserve the smoothness of motion, resulting in a frame rate equal to the field rate (i.e. a 60i signal would be converted to 60p.) Some line doublers are capable of using the former technique in moving areas and the latter in static areas (to avoid bob effect), which improves overall sharpness. It is worth noting that even if a line doubler employs the merging method it cannot be considered an inverse telecine device if a frame rate of 60p other than the original 24p is obtained. From this aspect of view some hyped progressive scan technologies (including Pioneer's PureCinema Progressive Scan) bearing an inverse telecine insignia are thus overstated.|$|E

Hence, the input digital source is normally upsampled to a higher frequency. It was also proved that converting uniform samples to natural samples will decrease the harmonic distortion. Thus, in this paper, we examine a new approach that combines upsampling, <b>digital</b> <b>interpolation</b> and natural sampling conversion.
