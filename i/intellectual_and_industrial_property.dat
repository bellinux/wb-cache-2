" This thesis reflects on Protection of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Property</b> {{as a part of a}} modern legal system which is getting more and more important in legal systems of all states. Protection of <b>intellectual</b> rights <b>and</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> became an integral part of the legal system in every developed country. In my work, I describe a wide range of Czech legislation governing the creative work in the field of <b>industrial</b> <b>property.</b> Very intense development in science and technology during the last decade caused growing importance of <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> rights. Protection of <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> is a very important framework of innovation stimulating research and development investment and transfer of knowledge from laboratory to the marketplace. It is clear that this course of economic life has received much attention not only in domestic law but also in international law. The protection of <b>Industrial</b> <b>property</b> rights is important for economical development at home as well as on an international level which led to establishing legislative protection in legal systems of individual countries as well as international treaties and agreements.

The thesis begins with defining the industrial rights as a term {{and its relation to}} the broader area of intellectual property rights. The main international classifications of <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> rights are introduced along with the basic principles of their international protection. The thesis subsequently approaches the historical introduction to the examined issues beginning in antiquity and progressing until the great industrial revolution of the nineteenth century which has led to the adoption of The Paris Convention for the Protection of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Property.</b> The general provisions of The Paris Convention and The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights are dealt with in a separate chapter, including the historical basis of both treaties, their main principles and contribution to the international protection of <b>intellectual</b> <b>property</b> generally, <b>and</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> specifically.

These changes in economic policy are related to Turkey 2 ̆ 7 s desire to foster closer economic links with the European Union (“EU” or “Community”). Relations between Turkey and the European Union take place within the framework of an Association Agreement (“Ankara Agreement”). The Ankara Agreement was signed on September 12, 1963, and became effective on January 1, 1973.

We use a case study to examine different aspects of franchisee websites that can damage concept uniformity. This study involves Intercaves, a French franchise network in the wine and alcohol sector.

It highlights how the Commission’s Guidance Paper included an incipient model of more effects-based competition law that departs from the static market structure focus on exclusionary abuse and focuses on harm and efficiencies. It also covers recent cases on the misuse of <b>intellectual</b> <b>and</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> rights, including unified standards and smaller businesses, and explains the thin borderline between free and fair competition based on open markets and public policy, with innovation balancing respectively.

It consists in the development of an IP questionnaire, based on the adaptation of the marketing and sales AIDA model, allowing classifying IP practices and uses within a progressive scale. In order to get rapid understanding from companies, graphics that can be easily analyzed have been introduced.

40|$|Resumé - English {{language}} The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{the protection of}} industrial property and international law. The aim of the thesis is to {{provide an overview of}} the international treaties governing the law of intellectual property. The focus of the thesis also includes the current issues within this area of law. The introduction focuses on current dynamic development of the society and technology and the need for flexible legal framework in relation to protection of the industrial property, capable of addressing such dynamic development and changes. The first chapter includes definitions of terms concerning <b>intellectual</b> <b>and</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>property,</b> brief history and the philosophical origins of intellectual property. The second chapter describes important international organizations active in the area of industrial property and their mutual relations. This chapter also describes more in detail the two historically most important international documents - Paris Convention and the TRIPS Agreement and their most important principles. The end of the chapter deals with the status of the European Union and its legal norms in the area of industrial property. Chapters 3 - 7 gradually focus on individual objects of industrial property law protection. Firstly I deal with patent protection, its particular [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Italian Law 12 / 12 / 2002, n. 273 [0] as {{implemented}} {{through the}} Legislative Decree 168 / 2003 [1] has created "specialized sections" for IP-related {{matters in the}} courts (both first and second level) of Bari, Bologna, Catania, Firenze, Genova, Milano, Napoli, Palermo, Roma, Torino, Trieste and Venezia. These sections "deal with cases of national and communitarian trademarks, patents for inventions and new plant varieties, utility models, pictures and models, author rights and all cases of unfair competition when these cases interfere with the protection of industrial and intellectual property". This paper discusses the different positions of Italian law scholars and lawyers {{as to whether the}} list of subjects, on which the specialized sections are competent as written in the law, is intensive or extensive - in other words, whether the specialized sections should take care *only* of the matters that the law clearly specifies, or whether they should take care of everything "related to" <b>intellectual</b> <b>and</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>property.</b> In this paper several justifications are made for giving full responsibility to IP sections over all law cases dealing with intellectual property (extensive interpretation), together with a rebuttal of the most relevant positions advocating an intensive interpretation of the law...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate the accuracy and/or reliability of alternative methods of forecasting property valuations of non-residential real commercial <b>and</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> in El Paso to improve municipal revenue forecasting. This study seeks to identify and evaluate four econometric and statistical alternatives to present forecasting practices for nonresidential property valuation forecasts: (1) a traditional income elasticity method, (2) a regional structural econometric model, (3) a statistical ARIMA method, and (4) trend analysis. In order to evaluate the four models, ex ante forecast simulations are created for each modeling approach and then compared to random walk and random walk with drift models for both commercial <b>and</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>property</b> values.
