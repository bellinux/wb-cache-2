5000|$|On 10 September 2007, Makov {{entered a}} guilty plea to one {{information}} count of conspiracy. He {{agreed to pay}} a $10 million penalty and provided new details on those involved. Makov gave a brief explanation on the workings of BLIPS, or Bond Linked <b>Issue</b> <b>Premium</b> Structure, which he said he helped create. In previous hearings, Judge Kaplan had chastised prosecutors for failing to explain clearly how BLIPS worked. According to Makov's testimony, the BLIPS shelters were created to generate artificial losses that were then used by wealthy investors to offset gains in legitimate income. The shelter involved a purported investment component as well as banks, extending purported loans to investors. According to prosecutors, BLIPS were marketed and sold around 1999 and 2000 to at least 186 wealthy investors and generated at least $5.1 billion in phony tax losses. The Presidio entities that Makov formed, owned, and operated with co-defendants Robert Pfaff and John Larson, both former KPMG employees, made at least $134 million selling BLIPS. The IRS regards a tax shelter as abusive if it has no legitimate business purpose or genuine economic substance, in contrast to real loans, with money at risk, or real investments. According to Makov, although BLIPS were created on paper to look like seven-year investments, they involved neither real loans nor real investment components. [...] "There was no economic substance," [...] Makov testified. [...] "Instead, we created the appearance of economic substance, rather than the reality." [...] Makov claimed that although he initially thought that BLIPS were legitimate, [...] "as part of the deception" [...] he was eventually [...] "asked by representatives of Bank A," [...] among others, [...] "to {{come up with an}} investment rationale." [...] He added that he was [...] "clearly told by Bank A, KPMG" [...] and others [...] "that the loan was not at risk." [...] According to The New York Times, people close to the case have identified “Bank A” as Deutsche Bank AG. The bank has not been charged, but is expected to reach a settlement with the government. A graduate of the Harvard Business School and a one-time employee of Long-Term Capital Management, prior to founding Presidio around 1999, Makov worked at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, an investment banking arm of Deutsche Bank AG. Makov was originally charged with dozens of counts of fraud, tax evasion and conspiracy, with each count carrying five years in jail. Prosecutors are expected to drop all of the other charges if he cooperates throughout the trial.|$|E

40|$|When a {{convertible}} debt instrument {{is converted to}} equity securities, sometimes the terms of conversion provide that any accrued but unpaid interest at the date of conversion is forfeited by the former debt holder. This occurs either because the conversion date falls between interest payment dates or {{because there are no}} interest payment dates (a zero coupon convertible instrument). The issues are (1) whether interest expense should be accrued or imputed to the date of conversion when such forfeiture occurs and (2) if interest is accrued through the date of conversion, how the forfeited interest should be recorded upon conversion of the debt instrument. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that interest should be accrued or imputed to the date of conversion of the debt instrument. Accrued interest from the last interest payment date, if applicable, to the date of conversion, net of related income tax effects, if any, should be charged to interest expense and credited to capital as part of the cost of securities issued. Thus, the accrued interest is accounted for {{in the same way as}} the principal amount of the debt converted and any unamortized <b>issue</b> <b>premium</b> or discount; the net carrying amount of the debt, including any unamortized premium or discount and the related accrual for interest to the date of conversion, net of any related income tax effects, is a credit to the capital of the enterprise...|$|E
40|$|Though Supreme Court upheld {{most parts}} of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Congress’ goals in {{enacting}} it could still be frustrated by non-implementation. During his campaign for president, Governor Romney promised “to issue Obamacare waivers to all fifty states. ” While such blanket waivers would likely violate the Constitution’s Take Care Clause, the ACA does permit other waivers. To be lawful, however, they must meet certain requirements designed to enhance access and lower cost. A president who opposes the ACA might be able to limit its implementation by refusing to <b>issue</b> <b>premium</b> subsidies in federally operated insurance exchanges, and this might be deemed a reasonable interpretation of the ACA because of a drafting error Congress made. Additionally, a president who opposes the individual mandate might be able to limit its effectiveness by directing the IRS not to make collecting the mandate’s tax penalty a high priority, and it is unclear whether the courts would accept the constitutionality of such an approach. Although President Obama won the election, Congress could choose not to fund key parts of the ACA, but it lacks the votes to repeal the Act. Many parts of the ACA, including the health insurance exchanges and high-risk pools for people with pre-existing conditions, were directly funded and, therefore, would require an act of Congress to de-fund. Other components, however, including many relating to health workforce expansion, quality improvement, and some prevention programs were not directly funded, so they could be starved of money through Congressional inaction...|$|E
40|$|Background: What is the <b>issue?</b> <b>Premium</b> honeys from Australia and New Zealand, in {{particular}} honey {{derived from the}} Leptospermum species Manuka and Jellybush, retail for high prices on the international and domestic market due to their high bioactivity. However, these honeys are increasingly being counterfeited or substituted with cheaper imitations. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop robust analytical protocols for authenticating the floral source of honeys. This will provide market protection for the beekeepers and the consumers. Research questions? Can chromatographic profiles of phenolic and volatile compounds in Australian and New Zealand honeys be used to authenticate the floral source? Do the phenolic compounds in honey contribute to the biological properties, including anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory? Which honey types and phenolic compounds within the honey have the greatest bioactivity? Methods: How was research performed? Volatile and phenolic compounds are currently being chemically fingerprinted using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Preparative chromatography of the phenolic extract has commenced to isolate compounds from honeys. The anti-bacterial activity of the purified phenolic extracts in the honeys is currently being investigated, using a well diffusion assay against Staphylococcus aureus. The anti-inflammatory properties of the purified phenolic extracts in the honeys will be investigated, {{in particular}} the inhibition of the pro-inflammatory enzyme 5 -lipoxygenase and leukotriene B 4. Research findings: Unique biomarker compounds are currently being identified {{for a range of}} honey samples that have been analysed. Mislabelled commercial honeys have been identified. All of the phenolic extracts from the honey samples inhibited Staphylococcus aureus. All honeys and the fractioned compound methyl syringate, common to all of the analysed honeys, have shown inhibition of the pro-inflammatory 5 -LOX enzyme, indicating potential anti-inflammatory activity.

40|$|This {{series of}} paper studies {{convertible}} bond financing {{from the perspective}} of both issuers and investors. Based on an empirical study, convertible bond financing seems to be overused: it would appear that convertible bond financing should be dominated by sequential issues of straight bonds followed by new equity issues sometime thereafter. A new model is introduced to demonstrate that managers of all types of firms, irrespective of quality would choose convertible bonds in their financing plans when facing uncertainties about the timing of the project. Convertible bond issuance can be optimal for firms that do not have an established record of strong historical performance but have opportunity sets that include good projects subject to timing uncertainties. The first part of this study focuses on the investor perspective and investigates the returns of holding convertibles/underlying stocks, as well as the returns of convertible hedging strategies. Naked long position of convertible bonds from issuance date and hedging based on the characteristics of convertibles can derive good returns. Consequently, investors can benefit from both the upside expectation of convertible issuing firms and the structured terms of convertibles. Next, convertible bonds are studied {{from the perspective of}} issuer. Here, liquidity risk, firm risk, and <b>issue</b> risk <b>premium</b> factors are identified as determinants of abnormal returns around the convertible bond issue dates. The market responds favorably to firm volatility risk, but negatively to the liquidity risk and <b>issue</b> risk <b>premium</b> factors. The cumulative effects of these risks determine the abnormal returns of convertible bond...|$|R
