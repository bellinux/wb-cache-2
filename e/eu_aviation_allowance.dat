EEX has offered trading of emission allowances {{on the basis}} of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) since 2005. EEX currently runs a secondary market for continuous trading on a Spot and Derivatives basis for EU ETS allowances (EUA, EUAA) and Kyoto credits (CER, ERU). As of March 26, 2008, it is possible to trade CER Futures on the EEX (Certified Emission Reductions), global emission credits in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol. On 14 April 2008 EEX and Eurex launched trading of options on EUA Futures. Since January 2010 EEX AG runs the auctioning of the Emission Allowances issued by the Federal Ministry of the Environment. All trading participants admitted to trading in emission allowances on EEX are able to take part in the auction without any further preconditions regarding licensing. From the very beginning, this also included all trading participants taking part in the existing Eurex cooperation on the Derivatives Market. In addition, EEX also carries out the EUA auctions for further countries (Poland, Hungary). The European Energy Exchange (EEX) has won the tendering procedure for the transitory auctioning platform for the EUA auctioned off by Germany for the third emissions trading period in February 2012 and it was chosen as cooperation exchange for the NER30 program of the European Investment Bank (EIB). As of 30 April 2012, emission <b>allowances</b> for the <b>aviation</b> industry (<b>EU</b> <b>Aviation</b> <b>Allowances</b> - EUAA) will also be offered for trading. Furthermore, Futures on Emission Reduction Units (ERU) will be launched at the end of April. In March, EEX extended the futures on Certified Emission Reductions (CER) for all maturities of the third trading period.|$|R

40|$|Part Three. Mobility in a {{low-carbon}} societyAs of January 2012 aviation will {{be included}} in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. In a Directive adopted in 2008, the European Commission decided to make all flights to or from airports located in any of the 27 EU Member States subject to the scheme. Aviation will thus join the emerging global carbon economy. The sector accounted for some 4 % of total carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion in the EU in 2008, and 13 % of CO 2 emissions from all transport sources, but its emissions could increase by an average 2. 5 % a year in the medium term due to strong growth trends in air traffic. The aviation sector has identified several ways of decoupling its emissions from traffic growth, ranging from improved fuel use efficiency to the development of sustainable alternative jet fuels. Its inclusion in an emissions trading scheme is likely to further stimulate its emissions reduction efforts. This chapter highlights the main facts, figures and trends related to aviation greenhouse gas emissions. It then describes the principles for the inclusion of aviation in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and assesses emissions projections and anticipated demand for <b>aviation</b> <b>allowances</b> up to 2020. Finally, it reviews the range of existing and future options for reducing CO 2 emissions in the aviation sector based on three main levies: an active air transport demand management policy, an increased efficiency of fuel use through technology, operations, or infrastructure improvements, and a lower carbon content of jet fuels...|$|R

On the one hand, the capital intensive, large-scale and complex airport investments need a detailed, long/medium-term planning of airport infrastructure. Such planning requires at least predictable traffic volumes (and traffic composition) within the planning horizon. On the other hand, airline route networks are increasingly dynamic structures that frequently show discontinuous changes. As a consequence, {{the much more}} volatile airport traffic restricts the value of detailed traffic forecasts. Volatility of airport traffic and its composition requires flexibility of airport strategies and planning processes. The book explores this dilemma through a detailed study of airline network development, airport connectivity and airport planning in the deregulated EU air transport market. The questions the book seeks to answer are: - How have airlines responded to the regime changes in <b>EU</b> <b>aviation</b> {{with respect to the}} configuration of their route networks? - What has been the impact of the reconfiguration of airline network configurations for the connectivity of EU airports? - How can airport planners and airport authorities deal with the increasingly uncertain airline network behaviour in Europe...|$|R

The choice of the EU legislator to include foreign air carriers and their CO 2 emissions that occurred beyond EU airspace infuriated third countries, while {{the fact that the}} directive applies the same treatment to all airline operators whatever their nationality met vivid criticism from developing countries, in particular China and India. This paper investigates the reasons why the environmental objective pursued by the <b>EU</b> <b>Aviation</b> ETS does not seem sufficient to render its unilateral adoption acceptable to the international community, despite staging multilateral negotiations and despite the flourishing national transplants of the ETS system in other jurisdictions. Thereby it provides a preliminary assessment of what the current row implies for the global governance of climate change. Devoting particular attention to the positions of the EU and China in this dispute, it argues that the opposition to EU endeavour finds its roots in the normative frictions between the climate change regime and the international aviation regime, while the lack of process legitimacy of EU unilateralism provoked third countries’ claims to the infringement of their national sovereignty. Thus, it concludes that in the current international system, the harmonization of regimes’ normative goals and principles must result from a political choice, the absence of which can effectively frustrate the achievement of multilateral cooperation goals. Moreover, in such context, the unilateral imposition of an alternative path involving the other regime members against their consent, to palliate multilateral norm-making, is likely to meet increasingly strong opposition from an increasing number of powerful countries. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|International air {{transport}} is at a crossroads. The aviation industry’s {{center of gravity}} has moved toward the East, with main hubs in the Gulf region and ever-increasing passenger markets located in Asia. Long-haul inter-continental low-cost-carriers have emerged. Global alliances and their effects on competition have come into question. These outcomes {{have led to a}} reignited interest in the issue of liberalization in aviation: European regulators now need to balance concerns about fair competition with their own decades-long push for the multilateral liberalization of the aviation industry. The European Union has {{been at the forefront of}} market liberalization in international {{air transport}} for the last few decades, relaxing the conditions of market access such as airline designation, fare setting, and flight frequencies. After deregulating its domestic market in the 1990 s, in 2005 the EU began exporting its open market policies to its neighbors and key strategic partners through comprehensive aviation liberalization packages. With this pioneering approach, individual countries handed over the economic regulation of their international air markets to regional bodies like the EU.

40|$|Problem: An {{analysis}} of the compatibility of global airline alliances with EC- competition policy including merger policy and EC-competition law. Is the Commission’s current approach to prohibit certain restrictive global alliances the optimal {{solution to the problem}} of certain alliances’ anti-competitive effects? Can other conclusions be drawn by taking an approach based on efficiency arguments that recommend a trade-off between the efficiency gains and the inevitable anti-competitive effects of the alliances? Will the results of the latter approach be in the public interest and does it conform to EC- competitionpolicy including merger policy and EC-competition law? Purpose: There are three aims of this paper; two intermediate aims, which are to introduce the complex nature of global airline alliances to legal practitioners, in particular the alliances’ impact on competition in the <b>EU</b> <b>aviation</b> market, and to illustrate the Commission’s assessment of the relevant market and its proposed measures to deal with the restriction of competition. Then my intention is to develop an alternative approach – “the efficiency policy” – and investigate its conformity to EC-competition policy including merger policy and legislation. Limitation: The question on what effects global airline alliances have on competition is naturally a global question, which is dealt with by competition authorities in many countries. In this paper no attempt is made to compare the opinions of and the measures taken by authorities throughout the world; instead the intention is to analyse the current EC-competition policy and merger policy on the subject. Method: In the descriptive part I will take a strictly positive approach and conduct an ordinary empirical research, i. e., to collect and present relevant legal and economic material that explain the legal as well as the economic aspects of global airline alliances. In the analytical part my intention is to analyze the Commission’s current approach towards Global airline alliances and to show how this has effected its decisions. I will then discuss the pros and cons of this approach with respect to the different interests that are to be protected by EC-competition law. Finally, I will develop an alternative approach"the efficiency policy"and discuss whether it conforms to EC- competition policy including merger policy and EC-competition law. Results: Global airline alliances bring efficiency gains, which can be distributed to consumers, communities and other parts of society. Nevertheless, the formation of global airline alliances will distort competition in some of the relevantmarkets. The Commission, which appears to have assessed the relevant market correctly, will not allow competition to be distorted. However, the remedies of the Commission seem to be inadequate. The reason appears to be a conflict between the goal of upholding"workable competition"and facilitating the efficiency gains that global airline alliances bring to society. This problem may be solved by applying another competition policy based on efficiency, which would allow airlines to defend decreased competition in terms of efficiency. However, due to the structure of Article 81 of the EC- Treaty, an"efficiency defence"cannot be allowed under that Article. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that it can be allowed under the Merger Regulation...|$|R
30|$|The EU has a {{comprehensive}} GHG reduction strategy [4]. The EU emission trading system (ETS) {{is the key}} tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from large-scale facilities of the power production and industrial sectors, {{as well as the}} aviation sector. The ETS covers about 45 % of the EU’s GHG emissions. Non-ETS sectors account for some 55 % of total EU emissions. These include housing, non-ETS energy, agriculture, waste, and transport (excluding <b>aviation).</b> <b>EU</b> countries have taken on binding annual targets to 2020 to cut emissions in these sectors (as compared to 2005) according to the Effort Sharing Decision [5] and draft binding targets for 2030. It is thought that with early action, the EU can get comparative advantages with other countries that start the implementation process later [6]. Modeling results show that the influence of reaching EU 2030 (as well as 2050) targets may be limited regarding GDP and positive employment levels [7]. A new investigation shows that the influence of anthropogenic GHG emissions may be significantly greater than previously estimated [8]. If these results are confirmed, an additional urgent global action might be necessary. Bioenergy will pay a substantial role in reaching EU climate—energy targets [9, 10].|$|R

In addition, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO) {{have not been able to}} agree on any action to ensure effective implementation of mitigation policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation and shipping. However, both ICAO and IMO are investigating several policy options. These options may have implications for monitoring and reporting requirements as well as for the allocation of responsibility for international climate emissions from both sectors. It is for this reason that the present report focuses broadly on all these issues. Against this background, the Netherlands Research Programme on Climate Change (NRP-CC) asked CE Delft and its partners to provide an assessment of the latest policy developments and scientific findings on the following issues: Development of greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation and shipping. Impacts on climate; for aviation an update of scientific findings since the 1999 IPCC Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere. Allocation options. Development of mitigation policies at global and <b>EU</b> levels for <b>aviation</b> and shipping. Data availability and data requirements. The primary aim of this report is to inform representatives of Ministries of Transport and Environment of the EU- 25 and other stakeholders on the latest scientific findings and policy developments with regard to the aforementioned issues. This may facilitate further policy discussions in the UNFCCC, within ICAO, IMO and the EU with respect to monitoring and allocation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from international aviation and shipping and possible policies to mitigate those emissions...|$|R
