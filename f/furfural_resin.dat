40|$|Abstract: A {{composite}} coating {{based on}} furfural matrix resin and Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles was {{prepared by the}} ultrasonic mixing of furfural with Fe 2 O 3 nanoparticles. Coatings obtained from this mixture exhibited improved photo-heat transition properties. The composition, structure and properties of the composite coating were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and spectrophotometry. The TEM {{results indicated that the}} size of resulting Fe 2 O 3 particles were in the range of 50 to 100 nm. The initial decomposition temperature of the composite coating was 250 C. The solar absorptivity (s) of the composite coatings was as high as 90 %, and its emission rate (n) was reduced to 56 %, while the relative eff iciency of light-heat transition (s/n) was about 1. 6. The nanocomposite coatings exhibited excellent abrasion resistance, weatherability and water resistance due to the formation of a three-dimensional network structure during the thermal curing process. The results indicate that the nanocomposite material {{could be used as a}} solar light–heat transition coating that could be employed in solar hot-water collection.

40|$|Modern {{techniques}} of castings production, including moulding sands production, require a strict technological regime and high quality materials. In {{the case of}} self-hardening moulding sands with synthetic binders those requirements apply mainly to sand, which adds to more than 98 % of the whole moulding sand mixture. The factors that {{affect the quality of}} the moulding sands are both chemical (SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3 and carbonates content) and physical. Among these factors somewhat less attention is paid to the granulometric composition of the sands. As a part of this study, the effect of sand quality on bending strength Rgu and thermal deformation of self-hardening moulding sands with furfural and alkyd resin was assessed. Moulding sands with <b>furfural</b> <b>resin</b> are known [1] to be the most susceptible to the sand quality. A negative effect on its properties has, among others, high content of clay binder and so-called subgrains (fraction smaller than 0, 1 mm), which can lead to neutralization of acidic hardeners (in the case of moulding sands with furfuryl resin) and also increase the specific surface, what forces greater amount of binding agents. The research used 5 different quartz sands originating from different sources and characterized with different grain composition and different clay binder content...|$|E
30|$|The {{samples were}} {{prepared}} by a two-step method. For a typical preparation, 3.0 -g urea {{was added to}} 4.1  g formaldehyde solution and stirred for 0.5  h, then {{a certain amount of}} furfuralcohol (furfuralcohol/urea at a weight of 0, 1, 1.5, and 2) was added to the solution and stirred for 1  h, and then polymerized at 373  K for 24  h. The obtained <b>furfural</b> <b>resin</b> (UFF) was carbonized at 873  K for 4  h under a N 2 flow of 50  ml min− 1. The carbonized sample (denoted as UFFC) was chemically activated with KOH (KOH/UFFC at a weight ratio of 1 to 4) at several temperatures in the range of 500 – 800 [*]°C with a ramping rate of 5 [*]°C min− 1 under N 2 flow of 50  ml min− 1 and maintained for 1  h. The obtained material was washed with excess amounts of 1  M HCl aqueous solution followed by deionized water till a neutral pH. Finally, the samples were dried in air at 100 [*]°C for 12  h. The activated carbon was denoted as UFFAa-x-y, where a represents the furfuralcohol/urea weight ratio and be omitted when furfuralcohol/urea weight ratio is 1.5, and x and y represent the KOH/UFFC weight ratio and activation temperature, respectively.|$|E
40|$|The {{reactions}} between naphthol and formaldehyde {{as well as}} furfural {{were carried}} out in different solutions. The pH medium of the reaction mixture was varied in preparation of Naphthol Aldehyde (NA) resin to study their influence on the structure and Fluorescence of the NA resin. The spectrofluorometry {{was found to be}} a successful and informative analytical tool to study individual naphthol and aldehyde resins. Naphthol, naphthol formaldehyde and naphthol <b>furfural</b> <b>resins</b> were prepared by the addition of formaldehyde or furfural to naphthol either in basic medium of 10 % NaOH, or in acidic medium. The physical properties of prepared compounds were already assigned in previous studies. Fluorescence spectra for the prepared compounds as well as formaldehyde and naphthol were investigated. Excitation and emission wave lengths for each compound were nearly identical but they showed a transfer toward ultraviolet region for basic formaldehyde resin at nearly 474 - 475 nm due to the increasing the aliphatic groups –(-CH 2 OH). While those for basic naphthol <b>furfural</b> <b>resins</b> were transferred toward the visible region at nearly 680 nm due to the increasing resonance in the aromatic groups...|$|R
30|$|Quite {{similar results}} were {{observed}} in the oxidation of furfural {{in the presence of}} redox metal salt catalysts [32]. It was shown that copper acetate and iron sulfate enabled respectively 18.6 and 12.1 % yields in the expected maleic acid. On the other hand, the catalysts based on other metal sources such as Mn(OAc) 2, RuCl 3 and NiCl 2 are substantially much less efficient for maleic acid formation. Interestingly, a Pd(OAc) 2 catalyst showed a 15.9 % yield to furoic acid, while only traces of this compound were observed over other metal catalysts. However, the major competitive process for the selective oxidation is the polymerization of <b>furfural</b> to generate <b>resins</b> under the oxidative conditions. The authors observed that in some experiments {{in the absence of a}} catalyst, the conversion of furfural was 56.3 % with only a 7.2 % yield of maleic acid. These results were explained by the polymerization of <b>furfural</b> to <b>resins.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The present work {{deals with}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of novolac polymers from renewable resource. This resin system was developed with cardanol and <b>furfural.</b> Cardanol-based novolac <b>resins</b> were synthesized with four different mole ratios viz. 1. 0 : 0. 3, 1. 0 : 0. 4, 1. 0 : 0. 5 and 1. 0 : 0. 6 of cardanol to furfural using dicarboxylic acid catalyst such as succinic acid. The resins were cured by using the most suitable curing agent, hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) technique was used to investigate the curing behavior of the prepared samples. The prepared cardanol resin {{has the potential to}} minimize the use of phenol resin based on petrochemical derivative. ...|$|R
30|$|Besides {{the effect}} of {{nitrogen}} incorporation, the presence of ultramicropores {{is considered to be}} another decisive factor. Recently, Presser et al. [19] studied the CO 2 uptake on microporous carbon in relation to the pore size and found that the micropores smaller than 1  nm are responsible for high CO 2 adsorption at 1  bar. Jaroniec and Wickramaratne [20, 21] obtained phenolic resin-based carbon with unprecedented amount of CO 2 (4.6  mmol g− 1 at 23  °C), and their study also showed that a higher capacity resulted from a higher pore volume of fine micropores (< 0.8  nm). Zhao et al. [22] prepared N-doped carbon material using p-diaminobenzene as precursor and found that furfuralcohol can improve the adsorption effectively, but the mechanism is not elaborated clearly. From our point of view, we are trying to find a method for the fabrication of N-doped carbon material with high CO 2 capture capacity from widely provided low-cost raw chemicals. In our previous work, we found that urea formaldehyde resin had good ability to produce carbon material with high CO 2 capture capacity [23]. Then, we expanded our strategy to urea <b>furfural</b> <b>resin</b> polymerized from urea and furfural, which also showed high CO 2 adsorption capacity [24]. However, the carbon source of furfural is not very widely provided as formaldehyde. Here, in this study, for the purpose of further improving the CO 2 adsorption capacity, furfuralcohol was chosen to form a copolymer with urea and formaldehyde and treated by the same carbonization-activation process to make porous carbon. The samples co-polymerized with furfuralcohol showed remarkable improvement of CO 2 adsorption capacity mainly due to the development of fine micropores, even though they possess comparable specific surface area (about 1000  m 2 /g) and lower nitrogen content, suggesting that the fine micropores, especially ultramicropores, play a more important role in enhancing the CO 2 adsorption capacity of adsorbents.|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{extraordinary}} resistance against acids, bases, solvents and chemical products, furane resins cannot {{be replaced by}} other reaction resins in certain fields of application in acid protection. These <b>resins</b> contain toxic <b>furfural</b> as reactive thinner. The development project aimed at substituting this material to realize {{a contribution to the}} humanization of working life. Benzaldehyde, furfuryl alcohol and cinnamaldehyde were selected first from a great variety of potential substitution products. Furane resin cements with good resistance against acids and bases were obtained, when using cinnamaldehyde as reactive thinner. Properties comparable with those of the <b>furfural</b> containing furane <b>resin</b> systems were obtained with a mixture of furfuryl alcohol and trioxan. The new furane resin products offer a diminished risk to health and a reduced nasal nuisance during production and working. (orig.)

30|$|For {{the oil and}} gas industry, CO 2 EOR {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} as a feasible technology to improve oil recovery. The EOR mechanisms include interfacial tension (IFT) reduction, CO 2 dissolution into oil to reduce its viscosity and swell oil, permeability improvements as the reaction of carbonic acid (due to CO 2 dissolution in water) with the limestone/dolomite, and wettability alteration due to asphaltene precipitation. It is notable that CO 2 and oil may become miscible when the reservoir pressure exceeds the minimum miscible pressure (MMP) which can greatly reduce the residual oil saturation and improve oil recovery (Li et al. 2015). However, viscous fingering (due to the viscosity contrast of CO 2 and oil) and gravity segregation (due to the lower density of CO 2) can develop quickly and lead to lower macroscopic sweep efficiency during the process of CO 2 injection. Reservoir heterogeneity leads to more severe early breakthrough of CO 2 in production wells (Hamouda et al. 2009; Hou and Yue 2010; Enick et al. 2012). Early breakthrough of CO 2 at production wells can reduce the sweep efficiency and undermine the oil recovery factor (Chakravarthy et al. 2006; Nezhad et al. 2006). A key issue of CO 2 flooding is to mitigate the problem of gas channeling, especially for the reservoirs associated with high-permeability zones (thief zones) (Xing et al. 2010). Different techniques have been developed for blocking channels with high permeability and controlling the mobility of CO 2, such as the water-alternating-gas (WAG) process (Christensen et al. 2001; Luo et al. 2013; Majidaie et al. 2015), injection of CO 2 foam (Khalil and Asghari 2006; Yu et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2013 a), and use of CO 2 thickener (Enick et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2011; Mclendon et al. 2012). However, the technologies mentioned above have their own limitations, for example technical feasibility, economy, environmental friendliness, and safety. Gel polymer systems have been applied successfully in oil and gas wells to control unwanted water production in recent years. A gel system consists of polymer, crosslinker, water as the solvent, and some additive materials. The polymers used in gel systems mainly include polyacrylamides (PAM), partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamides (PHPA), xanthan gum, carboxymethylcellulose, <b>furfural</b> alcohol, acrylic/epoxy <b>resins,</b> silicate based gels, and block copolymers. Meanwhile, the crosslinker can be classified into two groups: organic (such as phenol, formaldehyde, and polyethyleneimine (PEI)) and inorganic (such as Cr 3 +, Al 3 +, Zr 3 +) (Dalrymple et al. 1994; Prada 1998; Niu et al. 2013). For inorganically crosslinked gels, nanotechnology was used to extend the gelation time of PHPA/Cr 3 + systems (Cordova et al. 2008). The particles based on PEI and dextran sulfate (DS) can sequester Cr 3 +. In addition, PHPA/Cr 3 + system assisted by foam was evaluated to block deep wormholes (Asghari et al. 2005). Copolymers of PAM were also studied for crosslinking with Cr 3 + (Prada et al. 2000). Colloidal dispersion gels (CDGs) were investigated for blocking of “thief zones” in heterogeneous formations (Chang et al. 2006). With respect to the organically crosslinked gels, a system was designed by the PDVSA Research and Development Center that can exhibit blocking performance at temperature up to 160  °C. The PAtBA (PAM tert-butyl acrylate)/PEI system was developed for near-wellbore treatments, and it also can tolerate temperature up to 160  °C in fields. In order to enhance the strength of gels, materials were also added into the PAtBA/PEI system like cement, silica flour, and rigid-setting materials (RSMs). For the deep modification of injection profiles, two gel systems were identified: microspheres using PAM monomers crosslinked with N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide and microspheres produced by crosslinking 2 -acrylamido- 2 -methylpropane sulfonic acid (AMPS) with diacrylamides and methacrylamides of diamines (El-Karsani et al. 2014). Polymer microsphere emulsion attracts considerable attention for water shutoff material with relatively low viscosity that can be injected continuously and prepared using formation water produced from oilfields (Guo et al. 2014). Preformed particle gels (PPGs) were also used to overcome different drawbacks, which include the uncertainty of gelling due to shear degradation and gelant composition changes caused by dilution by formation water and chromatographic fractionation, inevitable in situ gelation systems (Elsharafi and Bai 2016). Although generally gel treatment is performed with waterflooding for conformance control, several laboratory experiments and field applications have been conducted to divert CO 2 (Martin and Kovarik 1987; Martin et al. 1988; Seright 1995; Hughes et al. 1999; Karaoguz et al. 2007; Hou and Yue 2010; Pipes and Schoeling 2014). However, gelation time limits the application of this technology mentioned above. In matrix treatments, it must be long enough so that the gel can penetrate into the reservoir to ensure sufficiently deep placement. It is difficult to control the gelation time with various factors affecting it, such as temperature, salinity of mixing water, and concentration of polymer. Hence, new types of gel systems need to be developed for blocking the gas channeling during the CO 2 injection process with more reliable operation.|$|R
