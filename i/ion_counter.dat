Whilst the random mesh phase is found in the ammonium homologue, the extensive correlated mesh phase seems to be a result of the hydrophobic nature of the tetramethylammonium (TMA) <b>counter</b> <b>ion.</b> In order to explore the reasons for the occurrence of these mesh phases and the effects of hydrophobic <b>counter</b> <b>ions</b> on phase structure the <b>counter</b> <b>ion</b> has been substituted by a series of increasing hydrophobicity namely butyltrimethylammonium (BTMA), dibutyldimethylammonium (DBDMA), and methyltributylphosphonium (MTBP).
