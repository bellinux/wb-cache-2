500|$|In August 2012, Marvel signed Joss Whedon to an {{exclusive}} contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon would [...] "contribute creatively" [...] on Phase Two of the MCU {{and develop the}} first television series set in the universe. In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, [...] "I understand what Kevin [...] is going for and where he's heading, and I read the scripts and watch cuts {{and talk to the}} directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful." [...] Whedon later elaborated that [...] "Since the story has already been approved and <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> we're doing with Avengers 2, we can really lay it out. It's not like anyone's saying [...] "well I don't know, what if I need that?" [...] It's like [...] "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will actually help us." ... You want to honor {{the events of the last}} movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see Avengers who did not see any of the movies in between or even Avengers 1." [...] He also found working in television and script doctoring to be [...] "great training ground for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Associated Press, Butt stated [...] "I do not want to comment on The News of the World because <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> kind of paper it is. Everybody knows about its reputation across the world." [...] He also stated that he was linked to Mazhar Majeed as a player agent but not in any spot-fixing. He also stated that the video can easily be edited and modified and manipulated. One day before the hearing, Butt continued to state his innocence. The tribunal announced that a verdict on the decision had been deferred to 5 February 2011 and that the ICC also stated that the tribunal would rule on charges pertaining to the third Test match between England and Pakistan. Butt was the only player before the tribunal to face these additional charges.|$|E
6000|$|But she didn't whisper (these {{children}} {{never did}} anything they were told): she said, quite loud, [...] "Of course not! <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> Dotty wants!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Eugene: [...] "Aw, come on, man. You <b>know</b> <b>what's</b> happening. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what's</b> happening. I've been, as they say, 'tampered with.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 100. I {{have assumed}} {{throughout}} these papers, that <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> Fiction meant; as Mr. Mill assumed in his Political Economy, that <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> wealth meant. The assumption was convenient to Mr. Mill, and persisted in: but, {{for my own}} part, I am not {{in the habit of}} talking, even so long as I have done in this instance, without making sure that the reader <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> I am talking about; and it is high time that we should be agreed upon the primary notion of what Fiction is.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah,' she said, in {{the middle}} of that agonised glide, 'you may depend upon it that if <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what,</b> I <b>know,</b> they'd all be on the other side of the ship.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; nominally. But {{of course}} <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> was meant. Upon my word there is twice more jealousy among men than among women. Is there not, Madame Goesler?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh! {{a younger}} brother here is--you know--in fine, <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> {{a younger brother}} is," [...] said my lord, and shrugged his {{shoulders}} and looked his guest in the face.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor can I--except the one. I {{suppose you}} know {{yourself}} {{what you mean}} to do about your cousin. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> you ought to do after the disgraceful {{things that have been}} put into all the newspapers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> Blome {{wanted and}} had intended, this {{question}} of Steele's seemed strange on one hand. An' yet on the other, now that the Ranger stood there, {{it struck me as}} natural enough.|$|R
5000|$|Firstly, {{the space}} {{occupied}} by the Monument is the former site of a bridge that was an important navigational and cultural landmark.3 Local people used {{to take pictures of}} the bridge and <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> you were taking about when you mentioned 'the bridge.' However, the bridge was torn down after it became a safety hazard, leaving a spatial vacuum of cultural significance that the Miners’ Memorial now occupies. 3 ...|$|R
5000|$|Artist Jon Knoles did {{the visual}} {{designs for the}} characters, while Harrison Fong drew the backgrounds. Fong recounted that he did very little concept drawing before {{rendering}} the characters on the computer [...] "because <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the Star Wars characters looked like." [...] Originally, the game design was planned to give the characters a dark black outline around their bodies. However, this idea was abandoned, as it was thought to make the characters too cartoonish-looking.|$|R
60|$|TANNER. [impatiently] Oh, tell him, tell him. We {{shall never}} be able to keep the secret unless <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> it is. Mr Malone: if you go to Nice with Violet, you go with another man's wife. She is married.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Much!' said Ralph, with a sneer. 'Why, <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> easy {{things to}} {{understand}} and to control, women are. But come, it's very nearly {{time for you to}} be made happy. You'll pay the bond now, I suppose, to save us trouble afterwards.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I WANT my {{photograph}} taken," [...] I said. The photographer {{looked at}} me without enthusiasm. He was a drooping man in a gray suit, with the dim eye of a natural scientist. But {{there is no need}} to describe him. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> a photographer is like.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes: to <b>everybody</b> we <b>know.</b> <b>What</b> {{is the use}} of {{straining}} {{after an}} amiable view of things, Marian, when a cynical view is most likely to be the true one." ...|$|R
2500|$|Each episode {{includes}} Tim's own Binford-sponsored {{home improvement}} show, called Tool Time, a [...] "meta-program," [...] or show-within-a-show. In hosting this show, Tim {{is joined by}} his friend and mild-mannered assistant Al Borland (Richard Karn), and a [...] "Tool Time girl" [...] — first Lisa (Pamela Anderson) and later Heidi (Debbe Dunning) — whose main duty is to introduce the pair {{at the beginning of}} the show with the line [...] "Does <b>everybody</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> time it is?" [...] The Tool Time girl also assists Tim and Al during the show by bringing them tools.|$|R
6000|$|Of {{course you}} are free to show this note to Mr. Boucicault, and I suppose you will do so; let me throw out this {{suggestion}} to him and you. Might it not ease the way with the Lord Chamberlain's office, and still more with the audience, when there are Manchester champions in it, if instead of [...] "Manchester" [...] you used a fictitious name? When I did [...] "Hard Times" [...] I called the scene Coketown. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was meant, but every cotton-spinning town {{said it was the}} other cotton-spinning town.|$|R
60|$|<b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> {{goes on in}} the Chapel, {{after the}} fight and {{scramble}} are over. The rustle and buzz, the music, the oratory and the poem, during which the men cheer and the girls simper; the professors yawn, and the poet's friends pronounce him a second Longfellow. Then the closing flourishes, the grand crush, and general scattering.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord bless you, Mabel! {{there is}} no more need of your talking in favor of my {{shooting}} on this frontier, than of your talking about the water in the lake or the sun in the heavens. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> I can do in that way, and your words would be thrown away, as much as French would be thrown away on an American bear." ...|$|E
60|$|THE INCA. I repeat, grossly overrated. Strictly between ourselves, I do {{not believe}} all this about Providence entrusting the care of sixty million human beings to the {{abilities}} of Chips and the Piffler and Jack Johnson. I believe in individual genius. That is the Inca's secret. It must be. Why, hang it all, madam, {{if it were a}} mere family matter, the Inca's uncle would have been as great a man as the Inca. And--well, <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> the Inca's uncle was.|$|E
60|$|The eldest brother, when {{he heard}} it, said to the other, 'I think I will spend some of my money in trying to build that ship, as I should {{like to have the}} king for my father-in-law.' So he called {{together}} all the shipbuilders in the land, and gave them orders to begin the ship without delay. And trees were cut down, and great preparations made, and in a few days <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> it was all for; and there was a crowd of old people pressing round the gates of the yard, where the young man spent the most of his day.|$|R
6000|$|... "What shall I go as?" [...] was the {{universal}} cry. Garrets {{were taken by}} storm, cherished relics were teased out of old ladies' lavendered chests (happy she who saw them again!), hats were made into boots, gowns into doublets, cloaks into hose, Sunday bonnets despoiled of their plumage, silken cauliflowers sown broadcast over the land, and cocked-up caps erected in every style of architecture, while [...] "Tag, Rag, and Bobtail" [...] drove a smashing business, and <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>everybody</b> else was going to be, and solemnly vowed they didn't--which transparent falsehood was the best joke of the whole.|$|R
60|$|Meantime Miss Trotter {{attended}} {{regularly to}} her duties, with the difference, perhaps, that she became daily more socially popular and perhaps less severe in her {{reception of the}} attentions of the masculine guests. It was finally whispered that the great Judge Boompointer was a serious rival of Judge Fletcher for her hand. When, three months later, some excitement {{was caused by the}} intelligence that Mr. Bilson was returning to take charge of his hotel, owing to the resignation of Miss Trotter, who needed a complete change, <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> that meant. A few were ready to name the day when she would become Mrs. Boompointer; others had seen the engagement ring of Judge Fletcher on her slim finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} it is better. He could not make me more unhappy than I am. Unhappy is no word for it. What can I do, shut up in such a house as that by myself from nine o'clock in the morning till six in the evening? <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> he is, so that nobody will come to see me. I tell you fairly, mamma, I will not stand it. If you cannot help me, I will look for help elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And de Gineral, {{he knows}} what cookin' is," [...] said Aunt Chloe, drawing herself up with an air. [...] "Bery nice man, de Gineral! He comes of one of de bery fustest {{families}} in Old Virginny! He knows what's what, now, as well as I do--de Gineral. Ye see, there's pints in all pies, Mas'r George; but tan't <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> they is, or as orter be. But the Gineral, he knows; I knew by his 'marks he made. Yes, {{he knows what}} de pints is!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> a Christmas dinner is, {{so we need}} waste {{no words}} in {{describing}} this one, but hasten at once to tell {{what happened at the}} end of it. The end, by the way, was so long in coming that the gas was lighted before dessert was over, for a snow flurry had come on and the wintry daylight faded fast. But that only made it all the jollier in the warm, bright rooms, full of happy souls. Everyone was very merry, but Archie seemed particularly uplifted so much so, that Charlie confided to Rose that he was afraid the Chief had been at the decanters.|$|E
6000|$|A little gleam {{crept into}} Saxton's eyes. [...] "Now, {{it seems to}} me that Devine has struck it rich, or he wouldn't be so {{concerned}} particular. It's quite plain that he doesn't want <b>everybody</b> to <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he's getting out of the Canopus. It's only a mine that's paying folks think of jumping." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not you. You told Mr. Brocklehurst I {{had a bad}} character, a {{deceitful}} disposition; and I'll let <b>everybody</b> at Lowood <b>know</b> <b>what</b> you are, {{and what}} you have done." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{the local}} merchants {{the results were}} less satisfying. Bob West put in a card {{advertising}} his hardware business and Nib Corkins cautiously invested a half dollar to promote his drug store and stock of tarnished cheap jewelry; but Sam Cotting said <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> he had for sale and advertising wouldn't help him any. Arthur drove to Huntingdon with Louise and while the society editor picked up items her husband interviewed the merchants. The Huntingdon people {{were more interested in}} the new paper than the Millville folk, and Arthur quoted such low prices that several advertisements were secured. Two bright boys of this thriving village were also employed to ride over to Millville each morning, get a supply of Tribunes and distribute a sample copy to every house in the neighborhood.|$|R
6000|$|... "Same solicitors, I suppose? I'll {{take the}} other things to them {{so as not to}} bother you more than I can help. Good-afternoon; I'm downright glad that they didn't convict you, and as for old Bell, he's as mad as a hatter, though of course <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> the jury meant--the judge was pretty {{straight}} about it, wasn't he?--he chooses to think that it amounts to calling him a liar. Well, now I come to think of it, there are one or two things--so perhaps he is. Good-afternoon, doctor. Let's see, you have the original and I will take the duplicate," [...] and he vanished.|$|E
60|$|Not {{many years}} ago the hovellers were notorious smugglers. Many a bold deed and wild {{reckless}} venture was made on Deal beach in days of old by these fellows, {{in their efforts to}} supply the country with French lace, and brandy, and tobacco, at a low price! Most of the old houses in Deal are full of mysterious cellars, and invisible places of concealment in walls, and beams, and chimneys; showing the extent to which contraband trade was carried on in the days of our fathers. Rumour says that there is a considerable amount of business done in that way even in our own days; but <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> a story-teller Rumour is.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lands, {{what can}} you expect when <b>everybody</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> her mother was? And if these {{traveling}} salesmen would let her alone she would be all right, though I certainly don't believe {{she ought to be}} allowed to think she can pull the wool over our eyes. The sooner she's sent to the school for incorrigible girls down at Sauk Centre, the better for all and----Won't you just have a cup of coffee, Carol dearie, I'm sure you won't mind old Aunty Bogart calling you by your first name when you think how long I've known Will, and I was such a friend of his dear lovely mother when she lived here and--was that fur cap expensive? But----Don't you think it's awful, the way folks talk in this town?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1990, {{over a dozen}} {{newspapers}} were launched, in either Kinyarwanda or French methodically exploited ethnic tensions. In December 1990, the newspaper Kangura printed the Hutu Ten Commandments of which four dealt specifically with women. On 29 January 1992, Kangura accused Tutsi women of having a monopoly on employment in both {{the private and public}} sectors, saying that they would hire their [...] "Tutsi sisters {{on the basis of their}} thin noses" [...] (a stereotypical 'Tutsi feature'). Kangura requested that all Hutu be vigilant against the Tutsi, who they called Inyenzi (cockroaches), as well as those considered accomplices. In an interview with Human Rights Watch one Hutu woman stated, [...] "According to the propaganda, the Tutsi were hiding the enemy. And their beautiful women were being used to do it. So, <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> that meant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} is. <b>Everybody</b> <b>knows</b> that. <b>What</b> the deuce {{was the good}} then of our going down there? I couldn't do anything, and I knew he wouldn't. The truth is, Mistletoe, a man now-a-days may do just what he pleases. You ain't in that line and it won't do you any good knowing it, but since we did away with pistols {{everybody}} may do just what he likes." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the door was open, and we entered. Mr. Mayor had issued orders {{we should all be}} shown into the parlour, where I rather think, from what {{subsequently}} passed, he intended to cut up Guert a little more than common, by exposing him before the eyes of a particular person. At all events, the reader can judge of my horror, at finding that the party whose supper I had just helped to demolish, consisted, in addition to three or four sons and daughters of the house, of Herman Mordaunt, Mary Wallace, and Anneke! Of course, <b>everybody</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> had been done; but, until we entered the room, Mr. Mayor alone knew who had done it. Of Mr. Worden and myself even, he knew no more than he had learned from Dootje's account of the matter; and the cook, quite naturally, had represented us as rogues feigning our divinity.|$|R
