500|$|According to Sánchez, on Friday, November 6, 2009, she {{and three}} others were taken in her own {{neighborhood}} by men working for the Cuban government. She {{said that she was}} heading to an anti-violence demonstration and was forcefully put into a car along with another Cuban blogger, Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo (she stated that the other two were placed into another car). She characterizes the event on her blog, Generation Y, as a [...] "kidnapping" [...] and describes the event in detail. [...] Sánchez said that when she was accosted on the street, [...] "The curious crowded around and <b>I</b> <b>shouted,</b> 'Help, these men want to kidnap us,' but they stopped those who wanted to intervene with a shout that revealed the whole ideological background of the operation, 'Don’t mess with it, these are counterrevolutionaries.'" [...] Sánchez said that she was put into the backseat of the car and received blows to her head, legs and buttocks as she was pinned down. [...] The incident was condemned by the U.S. administration and by Human Rights Watch.|$|E
500|$|Lonsdale Force's sector {{covered the}} {{southern}} end of the eastern perimeter, and Cain was one of three Majors defending this sector of the line. [...] As the battle progressed he became determined to destroy as much enemy armour as possible and sited himself in a laundry's garden, much to the chagrin of the Dutch owner. [...] Over the coming days Cain was everywhere, dealing with armour and snipers and encouraging his men. On the afternoon of Thursday 21st two tanks approached Cain's position. Guided by a colleague in a building above him, Cain waited in a trench until the first tank—actually a StuG III self-propelled gun (SPG)—was close enough to engage. The SPG fired at the building, killing Cain's colleague and showering him with masonry but despite this, Cain kept his position. [...] Staff Sergeant Richard Long of the Glider Pilot Regiment remembered that through the clouds of dust, Cain fired round after round from his PIAT until the SPG was disabled, but whilst engaging the second tank a round exploded in the PIAT with a bright flash and Cain was thrown backwards. Cain recalled thinking he was blind and [...] "shouting like a hooligan. <b>I</b> <b>shouted</b> to somebody to get onto the PIAT because there was another tank behind. I blubbered and yelled and used some very colourful language. They dragged me off to the aid post." [...] The British brought forward one of the Light Regiment's 75mm guns which blew the tank apart.|$|E
2500|$|....The Cayuga still {{led the way}} up {{the river}} and at {{daylight}} we discovered a regiment of infantry encamped on shore. As we were very close in, <b>I</b> <b>shouted</b> to them to come on board and deliver up their arms, or we would blow them all to pieces. It seemed rather odd for a regiment on shore to be surrendering to a ship! They hauled down their colors, and the Colonel and command came on board and gave themselves up as prisoners of war. The regiment was called the Chalmette Regiment, and has been quite a famous one. The officers were released on parole and allowed to retain their sidearms, all except one Captain, who I discovered was from New Hampshire." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{the king}} of the Franks [...] was on the hill with that band, they made a {{formidable}} charge against the Muslims facing them, so that they drove them back to my father [...] I looked towards him and he was overcome by grief and his complexion pale.

[...] But the Franks rallied and charged again like the first time and drove the Muslims back to my father. He acted as he had done on the first occasion and the Muslims turned upon the Franks and drove them back to the hill. I again shouted, [...] "We have beaten them!" [...] but my father rounded on me and said, [...] "Be quiet! We have not beaten them until that tent [...] falls." [...] As he was speaking to me, the tent fell. The sultan dismounted, prostrated himself in thanks to God Almighty and wept for joy.|$|E
