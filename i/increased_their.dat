5|$|Following the Manchester United board's {{search for}} new investors, the Glazers {{purchased}} their first tranche of Manchester United shares on 2 March 2003, spending around £9million on a 2.9% stake, which they purchased through a holding company called Red Football. On 26 September 2003, {{it was reported that}} they had <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> share to 3.17%, taking their shareholding above the 3% threshold that required them to inform the club's management. There had already been considerable speculation {{about the possibility of a}} takeover of the club, either by the Glazers or by one of several other interested parties. By 20 October, they had <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> shareholding to 8.93%, and on 29 November it was reported that they owned around 15% of the club and had met David Gill, its chief executive, to discuss their intentions. On 12 February 2004, the Glazers <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> stake in the club to 16.31% and the following day's Financial Times reported that they had instructed Commerzbank to explore a takeover bid. The club's share price increased by 5% that day, valuing the club at a total of £741million. The Glazers <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> shareholding to over 19% the following June, although they were still not the largest shareholders. Their shareholding continued to increase, nearing 30% by October 2004. Upon reaching 30%, they would have to launch a formal takeover bid.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to describe the students‘ perspective and to know which strategy is more preferred by the students and to know some benefits after implementing the two strategies. The subjects of the research were nineteen students of master degree program of State University of Semarang in the second semester. The instruments of the research were interview guidance, field notes and questionnaire. The data of the research were collected by doing observation, conducting interview, and giving questionnaire. The data were analyzed by using the triangulation technique. The result showed that there are 37 % students who prefer lecturer presentation, 37 % students who prefer students presentation and 26 % students who prefer both of lecturer and students presentation. This research also found that the students got some benefits in <b>increasing</b> <b>their</b> motivation in learning English independently, <b>increasing</b> <b>their</b> knowledge, <b>increasing</b> <b>their</b> vocabulary mastery.

5|$|A 48-yard {{pass from}} Roethlisberger to Santonio Holmes and a 48-yard field goal from Jeff Reed on the team's second drive {{of the second}} half brought the score to 10–0. The Browns' Phil Dawson {{converted}} two consecutive field goals, to pull Cleveland within four points with 3:21remaining. After a fourth down stop, Cleveland's offense took over with 26seconds remaining, but failed to gain yardage as time expired. With the win, the Steelers <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> win streak over the Browns to 10consecutive games—the longest current winning streak over a single opponent in the NFL. With the win the Steelers improved to 2–0 and led the AFC North by 1/2 a game ahead of the Ravens.|$|E
5|$|A wake low, or wake depression, is a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has <b>increased</b> <b>their</b> detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
5|$|After the race, Häkkinen {{remained}} in the Drivers' Championship lead with 74 points. Michael Schumacher was second with 68 points, seven points ahead of Coulthard and nineteen ahead of Barrichello.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how debt affects firms following failed takeovers. Using {{a sample of}} 573 unsuccessful takeovers, we find that, on average, targets significantly <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> debt levels. Targets that <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> debt levels more than the median amount reduce their levels of capital expenditures, sell off assets, reduce employment, increase focus and <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> operating cash flows. These leverage-increasing targets also realize superior stock price performance over the five years following the failed takeover. In contrast, those firms that <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> leverage the least show insignificant changes in their level of investment and their operating cash flows and realize stock price performance that {{is no different than}} their benchmarks. Those failed targets that <b>increase</b> <b>their</b> leverage the least, and fail to get taken over in the future, realize significant negative stock returns following their initial failed takeovers. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that debt helps firms remain independent not because it entrenches managers, but because it commits the manager to making the improvements that would be made by potential raiders. ...|$|R
