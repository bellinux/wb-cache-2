40|$|The {{kinetics}} <b>of</b> the <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> 1 -hexene using Re 2 O 7 /-Al_ 2 O_ 3 as {{the catalyst}} were investigated under {{a variety of}} conditions. The experiments were carried out under high vacuum conditions. The product solutions were characterised by gas liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The initial kinetics <b>of</b> the <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> 1 -hexene showed that the reaction was first order in the weight of the catalyst and second order in the concentration of 1 -hexene. A kinetic scheme which correlated the experimental data with the metallocarbene chain mechanism postulated by Herisson and Chauvin and the kinetics of the reaction was explained using a model based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood theory. The low conversion of 1 -hexene to its products is due to termination reactions which most likely occur by the decomposition of the metallocyclobutane intermediate to produce a cyclopropane derivative and an inactive centre. The optimum temperature for the <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> 1 -hexene over Re_ 2 O_ 7 /-Al 2 O 3 is 45 oC and above this temperature, the rate <b>of</b> <b>metathesis</b> decreases rapidly. Co-catalysts alter the active sites for metathesis so that the catalyst is more selective to the <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> 1 -hexene. However, the regeneration <b>of</b> <b>metathesis</b> activity is much worse for promoted catalysts than for the unpromoted. The synthesis and <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> 4, 4 -dimethyl- 2 -allowbreak (9 -decenyl) - 1, 3 -oxazoline and 4, 4 -dimethyl- 2 -allowbreak (3 -pentenyl) - 1, 3 -oxazoline was attempted and the products were analysed by thin layer chromatography, infra-red, 13 C and 1 H nmr and mass spectroscopy. Obtaining the oxazolines in a good yield with high purity was difficult and consequently <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> the impure products did not occur...|$|R

40|$|Although {{strained}} cyclic olefins undergo facile ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) catalyzed by {{transition metal}} alkylidene or carbene complexes, {{there are few}} examples of living ROMP systems because {{the rate of the}} polymerization is much faster than that of the initiation. The phosphines reversibly bind to both the initial and the propagating tungsten or molybdenum alkylidene complexes, thus altering the rates of both initiation and the propagation. Due to the steric bulk difference of the propagating species and the initiating complexes, phosphines bind more strongly to the propagating alkylidene than to the initial alkylidene, which reduces the rate of propagation much more than that of the initiation and results in a living system. The kinetics and mechanism for both initiation and propagation have been studied. By using this living system, linear and near monodispersed polybutadiene and polyethylene can be synthesized. Block copolymers of both practical and theoretical interests can be prepared. <b>Metathesis</b> <b>of</b> functionalized olefins using a molybdenum alkylidene complex was conducted. The <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> functionalized olefins is controlled by a fine balance between the coordination of olefins and that of the heteroatoms. The formation of chelated alkylidene complexes during the <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> alkyl- 3 -alkenoate slows down the rate <b>of</b> productive <b>metathesis.</b> The formation <b>of</b> a stable chelated metallacyclobutane complex during the <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> N,N-dimethyl alkenamide prevent its productive <b>metathesis.</b> Reactions <b>of</b> the late transition metal ruthenium carbene complexes with strained acyclic olefins and functionalized olefins are explored. Several [alpha]-hetero substituted carbene complexes and active ruthenium carbenes are synthesized through the <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> functionalized olefins and strained acyclic olefins, respectively. The mechanism for the rearrangement of alkoxy substituted ruthenium carbenes is determined by deuterium and 13 C labeling studies. Perfect rubber (cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene) is synthesized by ROMP of 1 -methylcyclobutene using a molybdenum alkylidene complex. New living polymerization systems of both bicyclo[3. 2. 0]heptene and bicyclo[4. 2. 0]octene are discovered using a ruthenium carbene complex. Narrow dispersed and regioselective alternating copolymers are synthesized through the ROMP of 3 -methylcyclobutene and 3, 3 -dimethylcyclobutene...|$|R

It revealed that a successful <b>metathesis</b> <b>of</b> hydrofluoroethenes is hampered by a high preference for a non-productive catalytic cycle proceeding through a ruthenacyclobutane intermediate bearing fluorines in positions 2 and 4. Moreover, the calculations showed that the cross-metathesis of perfluoro- or perhaloalkenes should be a feasible process and that the metathesis is not very sensitive to stereochemical issues...|$|R
