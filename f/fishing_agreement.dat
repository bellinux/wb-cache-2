50|$|Up to 2006, all EU {{funds to}} Greenland (then €42.8 {{million per year}}) went via the EU-Greenland <b>fishing</b> <b>agreement.</b> Between 2007 and 2013, the EU {{provided}} €25 million per year outside of fishing. It has been given aid since it {{pulled out of the}} EU (see below) in 1985 to roughly the same amount it was previously receiving in EU structural funds (which it lost the right to receive due to its secession). This amounted to about 7% of Greenland's budget. The amount paid via the <b>fishing</b> <b>agreement</b> was in return for EU vessels fishing in Greenland's waters and to help restructure Greenland's fishing fleet. However, this deal was struck down by the European Court of Auditors, who felt the amount the EU was paying was too high for the quantity of fish caught.|$|E

40|$|Many African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) {{countries}} sell {{fishing licenses}} to distant water fleets. <b>Fishing</b> <b>agreements</b> {{have the potential}} to improve the performance of local fishing sectors. They create income that can be reinvested into domestic industries and often go along with partnerships in management and enforcement. However, many <b>fishing</b> <b>agreements</b> run a serious risk of undermining sustainable resource management. The present study critically reviews trends in distant water fishing as well as identifies those tropical host countries most dependent on <b>fishing</b> <b>agreements.</b> It is shown that traditional, more responsible distant water fleets (DWFs) are being displaced by less responsible, low-cost DWFs and that the most vulnerable host countries are small coastal states with large exclusive economic zones that lack the ability to benefit from value adding processes associated with fishing. The results suggest that the once-promising concept of <b>fishing</b> <b>agreements</b> is gradually posing a threat to both economic development and environmental sustainability of ACP countries...|$|R

50|$|Developed {{countries}} are exploiting the fishing stocks of developing countries. In West Africa, <b>fishing</b> <b>agreements</b> {{are made with}} European, American, and Asian fleets because money is needed to build basic infrastructure like schools and hospitals.

50|$|The EU legal opinions, though {{arguing that}} rules of {{international}} law should be respected also by the EC when exercising its powers in place of its member states, enact a very narrow reading {{of the right of}} the people of Western Sahara and of the corresponding obligations of third parties, identifying Morocco as the main bearer of obligations towards the Western Sahara people and stating that it cannot be presumed that Morocco will not comply with them. According to Milano, since fishing is carried out by European vessels and since the Community has an active role in allowing this economic activity, by directly asking Morocco the issuance of licenses, the EU is directly bound to respect its international obligations owed to the people of that territory, when entering into a <b>fishing</b> <b>agreement</b> extending to a NSGT.|$|E

The Egyptian government continued to try to cover up the base by alleging that a new port was being constructed at Berenice with a road being constructed from there to Aswan, although through treacherously difficult terrain. This new road would allow produce from the area to travel to Aswan and also allow for pilgrims to travel from Egypt to Saudi Arabia. These claims by the Egyptian government were later proven incorrect following international investigation.

In 1762, Cook's exceptional work as a surveyor had been noted by the Governor of Newfoundland, Thomas Graves.

40|$|Abstract Co-management agreements, whereby {{community}} {{rules for the}} management of local floodplain lake fisheries are legalised and enforced by the government, have become common in the lower Amazon. Agreements are intended to limit exploitation, in particular by commercial boats, to raise stock abundance and fisheries productivity for the benefit of local subsistence-oriented fishers and for conservation. A spatially replicated observational study was carried out to evaluate the performance of <b>fishing</b> <b>agreements</b> in terms of perceived rule compliance and actual impacts on fishing activities, catch and catch per unit of effort (CPUE, a measure of fisheries productivity and proxy for stock abundance). Perceived rule compliance was high, and this was cor-roborated by observed changes in fishing practices. Catch per unit of effort was significantly higher (by 48 % on average) in areas subject to <b>fishing</b> <b>agreements</b> than in control areas without. Most likely this effect was attrib-utable to the effective exclusion of mobile commercial fishing boats. Household fishing effort and catch in local communities were not significantly affected by the agreements, although a tendency towards slightly higher catches at lower effort was noticeable. In conclusion, the co-management agreements have led to greater local control over resources and brought significant productivity and conservation benefits...|$|R
50|$|In the West African {{nations of}} Guinea-Bissau, Senegal and Mauritania, fishing was {{historically}} {{central to the}} economy. Beginning in 1979, the European Union began negotiating contracts with governments for fisheries {{off the coast of}} West Africa.

This violates the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas, which recognizes the importance of fishing to local communities and insists that government <b>fishing</b> <b>agreements</b> with foreign companies should target only surplus stocks.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we model effects on Norwegian {{industry}} and trade patterns of the recently implemented trade reforms - the WTO-agreement, the EEA-treaty, the OECD ship building reform and the EFTA <b>fishing</b> <b>agreement</b> - through changes in tariffs, NTBs, government procurement and subsidy policy as well as shifts in foreign prices and demand. We employ a highly disaggregated CGE model to simulate {{the difference between an}} economy adapted to the mentioned reforms and an economy based on a multilateral maintenance of the pre-reform trade system. Exports and import shares are modelled differently depending on commodity characteristics. Labour supply and national wealth are exogenously determined in order to focus on the gains from reallocations of given resources. The results indicate strong effects on the patterns of industry and trade. Specifically, we observe an increase in the production of services and highly processed goods, and a decrease in the production of raw materials and less processed commodities.

40|$|The {{pirarucu}} counting {{method is}} a simplified stock assessment {{that has been}} used as the main parameter for establishing the annual fishing quotas in the management system of the Mamirauá and Amanã Reserves. In spite of the method’s directness, considering the recent expansion of managed fisheries, we cannot confirm that the counters thoroughly obey the original methodology. There is a concern of a technical nature, as the results of the counts directly influence the fishing quotas, and the lack of technical supervision or the inadequate application of the method are factors that can compromise the management system as a whole. This study aims to assess the counts that took place in six fishing environments of the Jarauá Sector, Mamirauá Reserve, and in four fishing environments of the area of the Pantaleão <b>Fishing</b> <b>Agreement</b> Complex, Amanã Reserve.
