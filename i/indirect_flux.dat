Using a streamfunction in temperature-depth coordinates, cells are identified by {{whether they are}} thermally direct (flux heat upward) or <b>indirect</b> (<b>flux</b> heat downward). These cells are then projected into geographical and other thermodynamic coordinates. Three cells are identified in the model: a thermally direct cell coincident with Antarctic Bottom Water, a thermally indirect deep cell coincident with the upper limb of the meridional overturning circulation, and a thermally direct shallow cell coincident with the subtropical gyres at the surface. The mechanisms maintaining the thermally indirect deep cell are investigated. Sinking water within the deep cell is more saline than that which upwells, because of the coupling between the upper limb and the subtropical gyres in a broader thermohaline circulation. Despite the higher salinity of its sinking water, the deep cell transports buoyancy downward, requiring a source of mechanical energy. Experiments run to steady state with increasing Southern Hemisphere westerlies show an increasing thermally indirect circulation. These results suggest that heat can be pumped downward by the upper limb of the meridional overturning circulation {{through a combination of}} salinity gain in the subtropics and the mechanical forcing provided by Southern Hemisphere westerly winds...|$|E

Single pixel intensity events are converted into proton incident energy flux using modeled energy deposition curves for angles of incidence 60 deg in four EIT spatial areas with different proton stopping power. The extracted proton flux is corrected for both the loss of one-pixel events {{in the range of}} angles of incidence {{as well as for the}} contribution to the single pixel events resulting from scattered middle-energy protons (low-energy or high-energy particles are stopped by the EIT components or pass through them, accordingly). A simple geometrical approach was found and applied to correct for a non-unique relation between the proton-associated CCD output signal and the incident proton energy. With this geometrical approximation four unique proton incident energy ranges were determined as 45 [...] 49, 145 [...] 154, 297 [...] 335, and 390 [...] 440 MeV.

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the position-sensor less direct {{torque and}} <b>indirect</b> <b>flux</b> control of {{brushless}} dc (BLDC) motor with non sinusoidal {{back electromotive force}} (EMF) has been extensively investigated. In the literature, several methods have been proposed for BLDC motor drives to obtain optimum current and torque control with minimum torque pulsations. Most methods are complicated and do not consider the stator flux linkage control, therefore, possible high-speed operations are not feasible. In this study, a novel and simple approach to achieve a low-frequency torque ripple-free direct torque control (DTC) with maximum efficiency based on dq reference frame is presented. The proposed sensor less method closely resembles the conventional DTC scheme used for sinusoidal ac motors such that it controls the torque directly and stator flux amplitude indirectly using d-axis current. This method does not require pulse width modulation and proportional plus integral regulators and also permits the regulation of varying signals. Furthermore, to eliminate the low-frequency torque oscillations, two actual and easily available line-to-line back EMF constants (kba and kca) according to electrical rotor position are obtained offline and converted to the dq frame equivalents using the new line-to-line park transformation. Then, they are {{set up in the}} look-up table for torque estimation. The validity and practical applications of the proposed sensor less three-phase conduction DTC of BLDC motor drive scheme are verified through simulations and experimental results.

Molecular simulation methods, in particular molecular dynamics (MD), only allow the simulation of relatively small nanoscale systems. Continuum methods, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), are applicable at macroscopic scales but cease to be valid for nanoscales. This thesis is focused on hybrid MD-CFD methods with geometrical decomposition that seek {{to bridge the gap between}} molecular and continuum modelling. The hybrid solution interface (HSI) establishes the coupling between the molecular and the continuum domain. In this work, different realisation approaches for the HSI, flux and state coupling, are discussed and compared. A detailed investigation on MD flux boundary conditions, the most crucial part of a flux based HSI, is carried out. Different schemes for the imposition of mass, momentum and energy fluxes through convective and viscous transport are presented: direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>flux</b> imposition for convective fluxes; the imposition of momentum fluxes through reflective walls, external forces and the reverse velocity scheme; and imposition of energy fluxes through external forces and an energy transfer scheme. Different combinations of these schemes are compared for standard flow situations. The momentum and energy transfer by an external force creates a relaxation zone at the MD boundary. The characteristics of this zone is investigated in detail and a theoretical model for the density profile has been derived. The reverse velocity scheme has been created as part of this work to avoid the problems encountered when using the external force for the momentum transfer. It is shown that indirect convective flux imposition in conjunction with the reverse velocity scheme gives the best results for the standard flow situations.

(orig.) It is the {{objective}} of this paper to develop a methodology for the technical, ecological and economic analysis of solar thermal power towers, in order to supply a tool for the further development of this type of power plant. The investigation focuses on the heliostar field, as {{a large portion of the}} investment and operational costs of a power tower are related to it. To model the power plant, first the main characteristics of the heliostats (reflectivity, optical quality, tracking accuracy) are experimentally determined. For this task an <b>indirect</b> <b>flux</b> measurement system is used. Based on the characteristics of the single heliostats, the complete heliostat field is modelled using a simulation software which allows for all major loss mechanisms. The software tool is based on methods of statistical optics and Fourier analysis. The remainder of the energy conversion chain from the receiver to the generator is modelled in a simplified way using the respective efficiencies. For the application of the methodology a PHOEBUS-type power tower is assumed. The PHOEBUS plant can be operated in solar-only mode and - e. g. at times when there is not enough solar irradiation - with natural gas co-firing. This operation mode using two energy carriers is called hybrid mode. As different heliostat technologies are in use or under development at present, three modern heliostats of different size and type are investigated in the analysis. Based on the technical characteristics determined before, the respective heliostat fields for a 30 MW PHOEBUS power tower are designed for a direct comparison. In the frame of the technical analysis, ultimately the electric energy supplied during the life of the power plant is calculated. (orig.)

Coastal zones {{have been}} shown to provide a massive source of new aerosol {{particles}} in the atmospheric boundary layer with concentrations exceeding 1, 000, 000 cm- 3 during nucleation bursts sustained over many hours [O’Dowd, 2000].

First of all, the classical direct torque control of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) with sinusoidal back-EMF {{is discussed in}} detail. Secondly, the proposed two-phase conduction mode for DTC of BLDC motors is introduced in the constant torque region. In this control scheme, only two phases conduct at any instant of time using a six-switch inverter. By properly selecting the inverter voltage space vectors of the two-phase conduction mode from a simple look-up table the desired quasi-square wave current is obtained. Therefore, {{it is possible to}} achieve DTC of a BLDC motor drive with faster torque response while the stator flux linkage amplitude is deliberately kept almost constant by ignoring the flux control in the constant torque region. Third, the avarege current controlled boost power factor correction (PFC) method is applied to the previously discussed proposed DTC of BLDC motor drive in the constant torque region. The test results verify that the proposed PFC for DTC of BLDC motor drive improves the power factor from 0. 77 to about 0. 9997 irrespective of the load. Fourth, the DTC technique for BLDC motor using four-switch inverter in the constant torque region is studied. For effective torque control in two phase conduction mode, a novel switching pattern incorporating the voltage vector look-up table is designed and implemented for four-switch inverter to produce the desired torque characteristics.

This paper presents a scheme for the estimation of rotor resistance using a neural networks (NN) block. In this system the flux and torque have been estimated by using stator voltages and currents. A back-propagation NN receives the flux and torque errors and a supposed rotor resistance at the input and estimates the actual rotor resistance at the output, which {{is used in the}} control of an indirect vector-controlled drive system.

A finite element analysis based model explores the performance of the proposed method. Finally the use of the fixture to characterize an actual sample is demonstrated. ...|$|R
40|$|A two-moving-layer {{diagnostic}} {{model with}} a variable depth mixed layer on top {{is applied to the}} annual mean climatology of the North Atlantic. Estimates of the annual mean mass flux from the mixed layer into the upper thermocline (called mixed layer pumping) and subsurface heating rates are obtained on the basin scale from hydrographic data alone. No independent measures of wind stress or other surface forcings are required. In addition, it is shown that the nonlinear terms in the vorticity equation are critical to balance the subsurface heat flux in the Gulf Stream and over most of the subtropical gyre. Evidence is presented for the existence of interior, southeastern, northeastern, and recirculation regimes in the North Atlantic. These regimes are distinguished by the behavior of the characteristic trajectories of the system and by whether the flow is a direct cell (interfacial flux and vertical velocity have the same sign) or <b>indirect</b> cell (interfacial <b>flux</b> and vertical velocity have the opposite sign). It is demonstrated here that one can make use of analytic approaches in the analysis of historical data sets to yield relatively simple solutions that give a direct link between theory and observations. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} the direct dark matter detection spin-independent and proton spin-dependent cross-sections for a semi-realistic intersecting D 6 -brane model. The cross-sections are {{compared to the}} latest constraints of the current dark matter direct detection experiments, {{as well as the}} projected results of future dark matter experiments. The allowed parameter space of the intersecting D 6 -brane model is shown with all current experimental constraints, including those regions satisfying the WMAP and Supercritical String Cosmology (SSC) limits on the dark matter density in the universe. Additionally, we compute the <b>indirect</b> detection gamma-ray <b>flux</b> resulting from neutralino annihilation for the D 6 -brane model and compare the flux to the projected sensitivity of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Finally, we compute the direct and indirect detection cross-sections as well as the gamma-ray flux resulting from WIMP annihilations for the one-parameter model for comparison, where the one-parameter model is a highly constrained subset of the mSUGRA parameter space such that the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are functions of the common gaugino mass, which is common to many string compactifications.

40|$|A non-universal scalar mass supergravity type {{of model}} is {{explored}} {{where the first}} two generation of scalars and the third generation of sleptons may be very massive. Lighter or vanishing third generation of squarks as well as Higgs scalars at the unification scale cause the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking constraint to be less prohibitive. Thus, both FCNC/CP-violation problems {{as well as the}} naturalness problem are within control. We identify a large slepton mass effect in the RGE of m_H_D^ 2 (for the down type of Higgs) that may turn the later negative at the electroweak scale even for a small tanβ. A hyperbolic branch/focus point like effect is found for m_A^ 2 that may result in very light Higgs spectra. The lightest stable particle is dominantly a bino that pair annihilates via Higgs exchange, giving rise to a WMAP satisfied relic density region for all tanβ. Detection prospects of such LSPs in the upcoming dark matter experiments both of direct and <b>indirect</b> types (photon <b>flux)</b> are interesting. The Higgs bosons and the third generation of squarks are light in this scenario and these may be easily probed besides charginos and neutralinos in the early runs of LHC.

40|$|Dark matter {{could be}} {{captured}} in the Sun and self-annihilate, giving rise to an observable neutrino <b>flux.</b> <b>Indirect</b> searches for dark matter looking for this signal with neutrino telescopes have resulted in tight constraints on the interaction cross-section of dark matter with ordinary matter. We investigate how robust limits are against astro-physical uncertainties. We study {{the effect of the}} velocity distribution of dark matter in our Galaxy on capture rates in the Sun. We investigate four sources of uncertainties: orbital speed of the Sun, escape velocity of dark matter from the halo, dark matter velocity distribution functions and existence of a dark disc. We find that even extreme cases currently discussed do not decrease the sensitivity of indirect detection significantly because the capture is achieved over a broad range of the velocity distribution by integration over the velocity distribution. The effect of the uncertainty in the high-velocity tail of dark matter halo is very marginal as the capture process is rather inefficient at this region. The difference in capture rate in the Sun for various scenarios is compared to the expected change in event rates for direct detection. The possibility of co-rotating structure with the Sun can largely boost the signal and hence makes the interpretation of indirect detection conservative compared to direct detection.
