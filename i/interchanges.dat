5|$|Caltrans {{has plans}} to improve merging {{distances}} by constructing auxiliary lanes between the <b>interchanges,</b> and to add new <b>interchanges</b> at Lammers Road and Paradise Road.|$|E
5|$|Eleven <b>interchanges</b> {{were built}} along the turnpike, {{most of which}} were trumpet <b>interchanges</b> where all ramps merge at the toll booths; only the New Stanton, Carlisle and Middlesex <b>interchanges</b> did not follow this design. Lighting was {{installed}} approaching <b>interchanges,</b> along with acceleration and deceleration lanes. The road also featured guardrails, consisting of steel panels attached to I-beams. Large exit signs were used, and road signs had cat's-eye reflectors to increase visibility at night; billboards were prohibited. In September 1940, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission ruled that trucks and buses would be allowed to use the highway.|$|E
5|$|The A3 {{motorway}} {{consists of}} two traffic lanes and an emergency lane in each driving direction along its entire length. As of September 2010, the motorway has 21 <b>interchanges,</b> providing access to numerous towns and cities and the Croatian state road network. Almost all of the existing <b>interchanges</b> are trumpet <b>interchanges,</b> except for Lučko, which is a stack interchange, and Jankomir, Kosnica, Ivanja Reka and Sredanci, which are cloverleaf <b>interchanges.</b> The motorway follows Pan-European Corridor X, and forms junctions with Pan-European Corridors Vb and Vc within Croatia.|$|E

Currently the section between Nijō Shikaka <b>Interchange</b> and Minamihata Taniguchi <b>Interchange,</b> Yamashiro Kubara <b>Interchange</b> and Imabuku <b>Interchange,</b> and Saza <b>Interchange</b> and Sasebo Daitō <b>Interchange</b> operates according to this principle.|$|R
