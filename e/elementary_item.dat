40|$|In psychometrics, Item Response Theory (or latent trait theory) is a {{mathematical}} model for the design, the analysis, and the scoring of tests measuring abilities or attitudes. Since the last thirty years, it has replaced the classical test theory for the preparation of tests with important consequences for the test taker. The impact of Item Response Theory on psychometrics, educational measurements, entrance examinations and job interviews has been enormous. Despite of this, routine testing in secondary education is still based on classical methods. The most plausible reason is that even an <b>elementary</b> <b>Item</b> Response Theory analysis of a test needs some non-trivial numerical effort which can be done only by means of some computer. Until few years ago, this was a problem. However, {{with the advent of}} fast processors, these operations can be easily performed at home by means of a personal computer. To be concrete, we illustrate one example of application of the Item Response Theory in case of a typical test for pupils at the college. We analyze the score results of a F 3 Prototype MBO Rekentoets test, taken in two 3 rd-year WVO classes at the Sondevick College of Veldhoven. The test consists of seventeen free response items dichotomously scored, namely 1 for a correct answer and 0 otherwise. The item characteristic curves and the examinees'ability scores are calculated numerically by means of the maximum likelihood estimation. Through the description of the item information functions, the nature of each item is elucidated and a statistical profile of the pupils' skills can be outlined. The analysis presented in this work, can be of some utility for the interested teacher who wants to see IRT at work without addressing the extensive specialized literature on the subject. Moreover, our analysis supports the idea that item response theory could be adopted on a regular basis at school...|$|E

40|$|The {{relational}} model, {{as proposed}} by Codd, contained the concept of relations as tables composed of tuples of single valued attributes taken from a domain. In most of the early literature this domain was assumed to consist of <b>elementary</b> <b>items</b> such as simple (atomic) values, defined complex data types or arbitrary length binary objects. Subsequently the nested relational or non-first normal form model allowing set-valued or relation-valued attributes was proposed. Within this model an attribute could takemultiple values or complete relations as values. This paper presents a further extension to the relational model which allows domains to {{be defined as a}} hierarchy (specifically a lattice) of concepts, shows how differenttypes of imperfect knowledge can be represented in attributes defined over such domains, and demonstrates how lattices allow the accommodation of some forms of inductive queries. While our model is applied to flat relations, many of the results given are applicable also to nested relations. Necessary extensions to the relational algebra and the query language SQL are also discussed.

40|$|In {{empirical}} economic research, individual {{prices are}} often aggregated into average prices of sub-aggregates. Then, these average prices are aggregated {{to produce the}} average price of the total aggregate. Often, such two stage procedures help to illuminate the underlying forces driving the overall result. Since price data are usually published as price changes, this two stage aggregation is typically based on some price index formula. In this paper, various screening devices are introduced which help to differentiate between suitable and unsuitable formulas. It is argued that testing for weak consistency in aggregation is a particularly important screening device. If a price index formula fails the weak consistency test and, nevertheless, this formula is used for a multi stage price index computation, then the measured overall price change depends on the number of computational stages and also on the precise manner in which the <b>elementary</b> <b>items</b> are partitioned into Subaggregates. In other words, the findings are not robust and cannot be considered as particularly reliable. Based on these screening devices, it is examined which price index formulas can be expected to produce consistent results. Price index, aggregation, test, consistency...|$|R

To meet this requirement specific activities concerning music listening are applied in the framework of receptive music teaching. The dissertation proposes a so called dynamic model to function as an ideal solution to didactic transformation of music. The model enables to set up such classroom conditions in which pupils find it easier to observe <b>elementary</b> <b>items</b> and structures of music and thus comprehend music speech as a whole. Naturally then, a presentation of a particular piece of music via this model depends on teacher's abilities and skills. Nonetheless, the achieving of success in receptive music teaching is determined primarily by pupils' profundity and intensity of reception. Teaching pupils to listen to music in an active way represents teaching them to handle music through the use of creative musical activities and simple cognitive processes. In other words, {{on the basis of their}} own activities pupils penetrate into basic essentials of music i. e. they analyze music, identify its functional elements, detect structural constituents of music and thus decode its message. Consequently, they are able to employ acquired knowledge and experience in an analogical musical [...] ...|$|R

The sensory system is steadily confronted with a massive information ow that arrives via di erent channels. In vision, spatio-temporal pattern arrangements that signal coherent surface arrangements must be somehow reliably detected and grouped into <b>elementary</b> <b>items</b> even in changing situations and under variable environmental conditions. Such a grouping enables the segregation of gural components from cluttered background {{as well as the}} adaptive focussing of processing capacities while suppressing parts of the scene that are less relevant to support the behavioral goal or task ([4, 8]). Grouping and segregation requires the interaction of several representations and activity distributions generated by di erent processing streams. Here we focus on the detection of contour features such as smooth boundary patterns as well as corner and junction con gurations by adaptive neural mechanisms. A characteristic feature of cortical architecture is that the majority of visual cortical areas are linked bidirectionally by feedforward and feedback bre projections to form cortico-cortical loops. So far, the precise computational role of the descending feedback pathways at di erent processing stages remains largely unknown. Empirical evidence suggests that top-down projections primarily serve tomodulate the responsiveness of cells at previous stages of the processing hierarchy (e. g. [7]).

40|$|Issues {{associated}} with virtual reconstruction are first dealt within this paper. Visualizing of no longer existent (architecture-) objects and their surroundings practically {{amounts to a}} “virtual comeback”. Furthermore, special attention {{is given to the}} description of the working procedure for a case study of reconstruction sounding out the potentials of QuickTime VR. The paper ends up with a set of conclusions, taking {{a close look at the}} “pros” and “cons” of this type of re-construction. 1 Introduction Irreversible destruction having removed identity-establishing buildings from the urban surface for all times is the principal cause for the attempt of renewed “imaginating. ” When dealing with such reconstruction first the problem of reliability concerning the existing basic material has to be tackled. Due to their two-dimensional recording photographs only supply us with restricted information content of the object under consideration. Thus the missing part has to be supplemented or substituted by additional sources. Within the process of assembling and overlaying of differing data sets the way of dealing with such fragmentations becomes of major importance. Priority is given to the choice of information. One of the most <b>elementary</b> <b>items</b> of information regarding perception of three-dimensional objects surely is the effect that color and material furnishes. It seems to suggest itself that black-and-white shots hardly will prove valid in this respect. The three-dimensional object doubtlessly provides us with a by far greater variety of possibilities in the following working process than the “cardboard model with pasted-on facade photography”. Only the completely designed model structure makes for visualizing the plastic representation form of architecture in a sustainable manner. Furthermore, a virtual model can be dismantled into part models without amounting to a destruction process thereof. Apart therefrom the virtual model permits the generation of differing reconstruction variants regarding color and material. Moreover, architecture models of a physical nature are inherently connected to locality as such...|$|R

40|$|BRIEF: Read chapter 7. 3 "Methodik" on page 82 - 84. This is the quintessence of this thesis. Another {{aspect of}} it is the {{appliance}} of semiotics as a tool for analysing principle solution sketches, as it is done in chapter 6 (page 59 - 70) and culminates in the definition of symbols for embodiment design on page 77. ABSTRACT: The Methodology of Incremental Embodiment Design states that the single steps of the design process, especially the step of embodiment design, are limited by the cognitive capability of human thinking. These limitations are contrasted with the ability of pattern recognition, that allows efficient judgment of complex situations and directed choice of options for action within a vast number of given possibilities. From the confession of limited mental ressources follows, that additional external means not only enhance but are mandatory for engineering design. One premise is, that this means cause preferably little cognitive load to leave more resources to the problem solving processes. Therefore the methodology has a need for native ways to represent archieved outcomes of its intermediate steps. Sketches of principle solutions, as a kind of effordless created line drawings, are an appropriate tool to represent aspects of a technical concept while developing it. To externalise partly embodied results is an act of communication of the designer with either himself or another person. This communication is an exchange of informations that are coded with signs. To achieve a precise information exchange this signs and their multilayered use have to be distinguishable and interpretable. For this purpose the knowledge of the instruments of semiotics is useful. The course of the methodology is a cascaded procedure, with the designer to define its pace and speed. Within a higher cycle of an opportunistic approach, readily identifiable sub-solutions of the embodiment design task are deteced. This allows the influence of expert knowledge and intuition and leads to an efficient convergence of the specific problem areas at hand. Not directly apparent problems are covered within an underlying systematic cycle by breaking them apart into their <b>elementary</b> <b>items.</b> The systematic cycle consists of steps of fast analysing and synthesising, that are passed multiple times and which are based uppon the elementary design model of working surface pairs and channel and support structures. The continuous change of the perception is the core of this systematic approach. While analysing, working surface pairs or their connecting channel and support structure are of main interest, and while synthesising a single working surface together with its adherent structure is focussed. The generation or variation of working surfaces utilizes the methods of systematic engineering design, which are founded in the basic rules and priciples for embodiment design. This task-tailored and highly structured approach fosters the quick passing of the single steps and avoids mental blocks caused by too high complexity and too many possibilities...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} be able to deal with the {{discrete}} nature of images in a continuous way, one can use results of the mathematical field of 'distribution theory'. Under almost trivial assumptions, like 'we know nothing', one ends up with convolving the image with a Gaussian filter. In this manner scale is introduced by means of the filter's width. The ensemble of the image and its convolved versions at al scales is called a 'Gaussian scale space image'. The filter's main property is that the scale derivative equals the Laplacean of the spatial variables: it is the Greens function of the so-called Heat, or Diffusion, Equation. The investigation of the image all scales simultaneously is called 'deep structure'. In this thesis I focus on the behaviour of the <b>elementary</b> topological <b>items</b> 'spatial critical points' and 'iso-intensity manifolds'. The spatial critical points are traced over scale. Generically they are annihilated and sometimes created pair wise, involving extrema and saddles. The locations of these so-called 'catastrophe events' are calculated with sub-pixel precision. Regarded in the scale space image, these spatial critical points form one-dimensional manifolds, the so-called critical curves. A second type of critical points is formed by the scale space saddles. They are the only possible critical points in the scale space image. At these points the iso-intensity manifolds exhibit special behaviour: they consist of two touching parts, of which one intersects an extremum that is part of the critical curve containing the scale space saddle. This part of the manifold uniquely assigns an area in scale space to this extremum. The remaining part uniquely assigns it to 'other structure'. Since this can be repeated, automatically an algorithm is obtained that reveals the 'hidden' structure present in the scale space image. This topological structure can be hierarchically presented as a binary tree, enabling one to (de-) select parts of it, sweeping out parts, simplify, etc. This structure can easily be projected to the initial image resulting in an uncommitted 'pre-segmentation': a segmentation of the image based on the topological properties without any user-defined parameters or whatsoever. Investigation of non-generic catastrophes shows that symmetries can easily be dealt with. Furthermore, the appearance of creations is shown to be nothing but (instable) protuberances at critical curves. There is also biological inspiration for using a Gaussian scale space, since the visual system seems to use Gaussian-like filters: we are able of seeing and interpreting multi-scale...|$|R
