50|$|As in most post-communist Central European countries, {{the fixed}} line market in Slovakia was liberalised only recently. Slovak Telecom Inc. (former Slovenské Telekomunikácie, a.s.) was privatised on 18 July 2000. <b>The</b> 51% package <b>of</b> shares was {{purchased}} by the German Deutsche Telecom AG for 1 bln. EUR (more than 44 bln.

40|$|AbstractDue to springback, {{deviations}} {{compared to}} the designed ideal modal occur during pipe bending processes.

As addressed within this contribution, with integrating optical 3 D measuring systems into the bending process, the actual state can be detected continuously. This enables to give feedback to the bending device for automatically readjust of bending parameters and thus prevent producing defective components. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>digitalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual contour allows a parametric correction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> designed CAD model, whereby the functional behaviour can be closer to reality within simulation models...|$|R

After this is digitalised in the laboratory, DDP add-on software is used to virtually design the full dental implants and mill monolithic test implants. These can be tested for aesthetics, function and phonetics in the third session. The testing phase can also be skipped on request. In the last session, the final dental implants are fitted for the patient.

Zbirka sadrži i zapise djela iz hrvatskog glazbenog stvaralaštva 19. i početka 20. stoljeća. Digitalizacija zbirke mehaničkih glazbenih automata prilog je osmišljavanju projekata digitalnog očuvanja hrvatske zvučne baštine, koji su zbog nedostatka nacionalne strategije malobrojni i sporadični. The Ivan Gerersdorfer Collection of Mechanical Musical Automata is a {{national}} cultural item of extreme importance and is a very worthwhile asset in the European context as well. In terms <b>of</b> cultural history, <b>the</b> collection encompasses <b>the</b> century <b>of</b> <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanisation, automation, recording and reproduction of music (18141914), which was, in fact, the century in which <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> mechanical music flourished, was perfected from an engineering point of view, and {{was taken to a}} higher level <b>of</b> acceptability. <b>The</b> collection <b>digitalisation</b> project covered systematic investigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collection and the documentation, <b>the</b> computer processing <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> objects, <b>the</b> <b>digitalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> Ivan Gerersdorfer’s bibliography, and design for the concept, data and function of Internet pages. This paper, in addition to providing a review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history and content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collection and an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>digitalisation</b> project, also conveys <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> new research. <b>The</b> unique collection <b>of</b> media for <b>the</b> music programmes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automata, which documents <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recording and reproduction <b>of</b> sound from <b>the</b> 1880 s to the 1920 s, has been systematically researched, computer processed, described in metadata and thus prepared for conversion to digital audio files. The collection also contains files <b>of</b> works from <b>the</b> traditional music <b>of</b> Croatia or from <b>the</b> pens <b>of</b> Croatian composers. <b>The</b> appendices contain a Gerersdorfer bibliography, a catalogue <b>of</b> <b>the</b> works from <b>the</b> musical repertoire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gerersdorfer Collection and a catalogue <b>of</b> Gerersdorfer’s discography. <b>The</b> <b>digitalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collection <b>of</b> mechanical musical automata is a contribution to <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> projects for <b>the</b> digital preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Croatian sound heritage which, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> any national strategy, are but few and sporadic. Mechanical music, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> technical problems related to <b>the</b> maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automata, is a highly endangered segment of sound heritage, which only digitalisation can both preserve for posterity and communicate to the public...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the referral pattern after {{the transition to}} full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in a population-based breast cancer screening programme. METHODS: Preceding <b>the</b> nationwide <b>digitalisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch screening programme, an FFDM feasibility study was conducted. Detection and referral rates for FFDM and screen-film mammography (SFM) were compared for first and subsequent screens. Furthermore, radiological characteristics of referrals in digital screening were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 312, 414 screening mammograms were performed (43, 913 digital and 268, 501 conventional), with 4, 473 consecutive referrals (966 following FFDM). Initially the FFDM referral rate peaked, and many false-positive results were noted {{as a consequence of}} pseudolesions and increased detection of (benign) microcalcifications. A higher overall referral rate was observed in FFDM screening in both first and subsequent examinations (p <. 001), with a significant increase in cancer detection (p =. 010). CONCLUSION: As a result of initial inexperience with digital screening images implementing FFDM in a population-based breast cancer screening programme may lead to a strong, but temporary increase in referral. Dedicated training in digital screening for radiographers and screening radiologists is therefore recommended. Referral rates decrease and stabilise (learning curve effect) at a higher level than in conventional screening, yet with significantly enhanced cancer detection...|$|R
