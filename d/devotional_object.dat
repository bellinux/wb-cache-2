5000|$|Jūbei (Nossori)A lowly, tactless {{and obscure}} carpenter, given the {{nickname}} “Nossori, Slowpoke by his colleagues” (27). He aspires {{to build the}} five-storied pagoda even though it goes against the wishes of his master, {{his wife and his}} collogues. When the Abott lets Jūbei and Genta decide who builds the pagoda, he experiences an internal struggle because although he cannot think of another purpose for his life other than building that pagoda, he is going against Genta, his master and the man to whom he is eternally indebted. He demonstrates the craftsman Katagi quite strongly when he refuses to work on the project with Genta and insists on building the pagoda alone, and, when he is injured after being attacked by Seikichi, he insists on going to the construction site the next day despite Onami’s protest. That action gains him the workers respect and speeds up the building of the pagoda. His obsession with building the pagoda to perfection alone is another sign that illustrates the craftsman Katagi.The introduction of Pagoda, Skull and Samurai describes him as someone who is “often lauded as a champion of modern individualism for refusing all compromises, or a ruthless social climber. But the crucial keys to his character are the nature of a pagoda and the religious implications of pagoda constructions. In Buddhist scriptures, especially the Lotus Sutra (virtually the sore <b>devotional</b> <b>object</b> in the Nichiren sect), the pagoda, or stupa, is identified with a variety of religious concepts: Buddha’s body; testimony to the truth of the Lotus teachings; the universe itself, in which the ancient Buddha (the symbolic moon) and the present Buddha (the sun) dwell side by side; and the Western Pure Land (whence the ancient Buddha returns to save mankind and whither the present Buddha will lead it). The construction of a pagoda is deemed equal to the preaching of the Lotus gospel in its ultimate religious merit.” (Pagoda, Skull and Samurai: Three Stories by Kōda Rohan, 16) Genta of KawagoeThe strict master carpenter possessing both skill and status. Both in his mien and his looks, {{he is a man of}} masculine charm who inspires anyone’s admiration (41). He rebuilt the Kanno temple and did such an impressive job that he was considered for the building pagoda. He admires Jūbei’s dedication and skill, and after hearing the story from the Abott he suggests they work on the pagoda together as chief and assistant, and upon Jūbei’s refusal Genta offers to take the role of the assistant himself. Genta’s suggestion stems from the fact that he is an Edoite scrupulous in performing his social obligations yet susceptible to sentiment, and is as unbending in his principles as he is unsparing in his kindness (57). After meeting with the Abbot a second time, he agrees to let Jūbei build the pagoda. When Jūbei refuses to use Genta’s estimates and plans for the pagoda, the latter vows to be watchful of the pagoda so as to punish Jūbei if a single nail falls out, and literally circles the pagoda during the storm, waiting for that to happen. His sense of honor plays a major role in the decision he makes, which plays up his honorable man Katagi. He gives up the pagoda project for no reason other than honor. Abbot Rōen of Uda“A priest so esteemed that at the mere mention of his name even a three-year-old would fold his palms in veneration. In his youth he pursued rigorous training and religious studies at Mt. Minobu, the headquarters of Nichiren Buddhism, and in his middle years he traveled throughout sixty provinces as a mendicant practicing austerity and asceticism. He had sharpened the sword of tranquil wisdom through contemplation of Samsara, this world, and Dharma, the Law. He intoned the sacred gospel of salvation in four dialects of Sanskrit. Now a septuagenarian, the Abott was as lean as a crane, the result of abstinence from unclean food -meat, fish, and ill-smelling vegetables. His eyes were always half closed so that he might transcend the turmoil of the human sphere. Having learned the Principle of Emptiness, he no longer kindled the flames of desire in his heart. Having comprehended the truth of Nirvna, he was free from the taint of worldly attachment” (Pagoda, Skull and Samurai 29).The Abbot views Jūbei through the lens of compassion and sees in him the good that everyone else overlooks because of his low status. He agrees to meet with Jūbei after his servants attempt to throw the carpenter out, and takes pity on him when he begs for the pagoda contract, and admires his skill after he sees the model he built.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} a {{major shift}} in French Gothic sculpture of {{the second half of the}} thirteenth century, as exemplified by the Sainte-Chapelle Virgin and Child. During this period there was a new emphasis on elegance in art works, giving rise to a new style called Rayonnant, a style paralleled by a new emphasis on the humanity of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The scale and patronage of the Sainte-Chapelle Virgin and Child demonstrate the changing purpose of sculpture from a ceremonial role in church life to a private <b>devotional</b> <b>object</b> for the French elite, in particular king of France Louis IX, for whom the work was made. The changing style and function of this sculpture is explored in light of earlier treatments of the Virgin and Child in Byzantine and Romanesque art and in the context of the rise of the cult of the Virgin and of a new emphasis on internal (as opposed to external) religious experiences. In this way, the paper provides a case study of the intersection of style and iconography with patronage and function...|$|E
40|$|Ostensibly John Lydgate’s verse Life of St Edmund is a characteristic, if lengthy, {{example of}} late-medieval hagiography. The Life was {{commissioned}} by Abbot Curteys of Bury St Edmunds, where Lydgate was a monk, to mark King Henry VI’s lengthy sojourn at the abbey between Christmas 1433 until Easter 1434. However, in addition to praising Edmund’s sanctity, Lydgate places considerable emphasis upon the temporal elements of his identity. It {{has been suggested that}} this emphasis upon Edmund’s exemplary kingship is due to Lydgate’s intention that the Life should function as a ‘mirror for princes’ for the young king Henry. This distinction is particularly apparent when the accompanying picture cycle is read alongside the text: the images form a unique visual parallel to the text and it is likely that Lydgate was involved in their design. This article will therefore illustrate how the notion of ‘devotional literature’ can be complicated by circumstances: in this case the audience for whom it was intended. By writing the reader into the text Lydgate transforms the Life from simply a <b>devotional</b> <b>object</b> into one that is simultaneously sacred and secular. It also demonstrates the importance of the context in which a text is read and received. In a poem intended to instruct the young king and influence him in both his temporal and devotional activities, Henry VI as anticipated audience exercises considerable influence over the text, demonstrating the subtle interplay between circumstance, author and audience. ...|$|E

40|$|This project excavates a discursive {{history of}} the relic in order to contextualize its {{deployment}} as a poetic construct in medieval romance narrative. Although historians have devoted much attention to this artifact of medieval Christianity, the relic has surprisingly remained {{on the margins of}} literary criticism despite its frequent appearance in French romance. Discussions of the literary implications of the relic in this field are both rare and cursory, evincing little interest in the complex web of figurative relationships subtending the cors saint. Such analyses instead privilege the cultural significance of the relic as a religious <b>devotional</b> <b>object</b> over its semiotic potential as a poetic figure, thereby overlooking the hermeneutic value of the relic in its own right. I examine how romance appropriates the relic as a literary symbol through a careful exploitation of certain key properties of its material life: the probative dimension of oaths and ordeals in Béroul 2 ̆ 7 s Tristan and Chrétien de Troyes 2 ̆ 7 Le chevalier de la Charrette; the healing power of song in the anonymous prosimetric Aucassin et Nicolette; and, finally, the representational poetics of the relic itself in Jean de Meun 2 ̆ 7 s continuation of the Roman de la Rose. While epic and hagiographic literature posit the relic as a site of political sovereignty or saintly power, romance instead explicitly links this sacred icon to the erotic body of the amie, transforming the beloved into a feminized relic, a true cors sainte. This strategic reframing in turn allows for a series of transformative linguistic disruptions in romance narrative, whereby the relic advances and legitimizes the idiosyncratic concerns of courtly desire at play in these texts. In this sense, the relic becomes an ideal candidate for literary appropriation precisely because it already mediates between, indeed embodies, different allegorical registers of somatic expressivity in medieval religious culture. In representing its own narrative of past fragmentation and future reconstitution, the relic proposes a hermeneutic model which bridges the gap between writing and reading, between allegory and allegoresis. ...|$|E
