5|$|The 1300s saw {{the arrival}} and {{eventual}} spread of <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> the Philippine archipelago. In 1380, Karim ul' Makdum and Shari'ful Hashem Syed Abu Bakr, an Arab trader born in Johore, arrived in Sulu from Malacca and established the Sultanate of Sulu by converting Sulu's rajah, Rajah Baguinda Ali and marrying his daughter. At {{the end of}} the 15th century, Shariff Mohammed Kabungsuwan of Johor introduced <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> the island of Mindanao and established the Sultanate of Maguindanao. The sultanate form of government extended further into Lanao.|$|E

5|$|<b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> Japan is {{estimated}} to constitute, about 80–90%, of foreign born migrants and their children, primarily from Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Iran. Much of the ethnic Japanese Muslims are those who convert upon marrying immigrant Muslims. The Pew Research Center estimated that there were 185,000 Muslims in Japan in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{predominance}} of orthodox <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> Palestine, the region contained numerous domed structures dedicated to Muslim patron saints, among which was the Mosque of al-Khidr in Deir al-Balah. In March 2016, the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities in the Gaza Strip began {{the restoration of the}} Mosque of al-Khidr with financial support from UNESCO and the Nawa Foundation. The project aims to convert the mosque-tomb into a children's cultural library.|$|E
5|$|Sarumpaet became {{interested}} in <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> her teenage years, but only converted around 1974 after marrying Achmad Fahmy Alhady, an Arab-Indonesian.

5|$|The colonial {{administration}} opposed {{efforts by}} the CMS to convert the Bari people of Mongalla.

5|$|The forced {{conversions}} of Muslims in Spain were enacted {{through a}} series of edicts outlawing <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> the lands of Spain. This effort was overseen by three Spanish monarchies during the early 16th century: the Crown of Castile in 1500–1502, followed by Navarre in 1515–1516, and lastly the Crown of Aragon in 1523–1526.|$|E
5|$|According to Fred Guweddeko, a {{researcher}} at Makerere University, Amin {{was the son of}} Andreas Nyabire (1889–1976). Nyabire, a member of the Kakwa ethnic group, converted from Roman Catholicism to <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> 1910 and changed his name to Amin Dada. He named his first-born son after himself. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Idi Amin grew up with his mother's family in a rural farming town in north-western Uganda. Guweddeko states that Amin's mother was Assa Aatte (1904–1970), an ethnic Lugbara and a traditional herbalist who treated members of Buganda royalty, among others.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>Islam,</b> {{marriage}} {{is essentially a}} contract. However, the distinction between sacred and secular was never explicit <b>in</b> <b>Islam.</b> Any action or transaction <b>in</b> <b>Islam</b> has religious implications. It is not quite accurate, therefore, to designate marriage <b>in</b> <b>Islam</b> simply as a secular contract.|$|R
5|$|Although Islam is the {{official}} religion of the federation, Sarawak has no official state religion. However, during the chieftainship of Abdul Rahman Ya'kub, the Constitution of Sarawak was amended to make the Yang di-Pertuan Agong {{as the head of}} <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> Sarawak and empower the state assembly to pass laws regarding Islamic affairs. With such provisions, Islamic policies can be formulated in Sarawak and the establishment of Islamic state agencies is possible. The 1978 Majlis Islam Bill enabled the setting up of Syariah Courts in Sarawak with jurisdictions over matrimonial, child custody, betrothal, inheritance, and criminal cases in the state. An appeals court and Courts of Kadi were also formed.|$|E
5|$|Brenton came up {{with the}} idea to show an episode dealing with a Muslim hero set out to stop a group of Islamic terrorists. Brenton and the {{producers}} researched elements of <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> order to provide a balanced view towards the religion, as well as the nature of the plot and to show Muslims in the episode who oppose the extremists among their religion. Although much of the episode was set in Birmingham, it was filmed entirely in London. The episode sees the introduction of regular character Ruth Evershed (Nicola Walker), and the return of Christine Dale (Megan Dodds), who first appeared in the first episode and returned so that the character's role can be expanded.|$|E
5|$|By 681 {{the armies}} of the Umayyad Caliphate had {{expanded}} from their original homeland of Arabia to conquer North Africa, the Middle East and large parts of West Asia, bringing <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> their wake and converting local peoples to the new religion. The Berbers of North Africa, called Moors by the Christians, thereby became Muslims. The Strait of Gibraltar became the frontier between Muslim North Africa and Christian Hispania and thus gained a new strategic significance. Hispania descended into {{civil war in the}} 8th century as rival Visigothic factions fought for control of the throne. This gave the Moors the opportunity to invade Hispania and pursue a course of dividing-and-conquering the Christian factions.|$|E

5|$|By August 1980 Umboh had {{recovered}} enough strength to direct his next film, Disini Cinta Pertama Kali Bersemi (Here Love Bloomed for the First Time), {{based on the}} novel by Mira W. Shortly before directing Putri Seorang Jenderal (A General's Daughter; an adaptation of Motinggo Busye's novel of the same name) in 1981, Umboh divorced Roemokoy. Umboh converted to <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> 1983 and changed his name to Ahmad Salim. On 24 August of the following year Umboh married Inne Ermina Chomid, a police officer's daughter of Sundanese descent 28 years his junior. As his health was improving, Umboh continued to make films, including Kabut Perkawinan (The Fog of Wedlock; 1984). Umboh and Chomid had a son, William Umboh Ikhsan Salim, in 1986.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the Muslim {{world had}} {{developed}} four major Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence (or fiqh), {{each with its}} own interpretations of Sharia: Hanbali, Maliki, Shafi and Hanafi. In Arabia, a preference for the Hanbali school was advocated by the Wahhabi movement, founded in the 18th century. Wahhabism, a strict form of Sunni Islam, was supported by the Saudi royal family (the Al Saud) and is now dominant in Saudi Arabia. From the 18th century, the Hanbali school therefore predominated in Nejd and central Arabia, the heartland of Wahhabi <b>Islam.</b> <b>In</b> the more cosmopolitan Hejaz, in the west of the peninsula, both the Hanafi and Shafi schools were followed.|$|E
5|$|By {{the third}} century AD, Palmyra was a prosperous {{regional}} center reaching the apex of its power in the 260s, when Palmyrene King Odaenathus defeated Persian Emperor Shapur I. The king was succeeded by regent Queen Zenobia, who rebelled against Rome and established the Palmyrene Empire. In 273, Roman emperor Aurelian destroyed the city, which was later restored by Diocletian at a reduced size. The Palmyrenes converted to Christianity during the fourth century and to <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> the centuries following the conquest by the Rashidun Caliphate, after which the Palmyrene and Greek languages were replaced by Arabic.|$|E

5|$|Holland {{suggests}} {{that under the}} reign of Arab Emperor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, even though {{only a small percentage}} of the inhabitants of the Empire was Muslim, Mecca was intentionally yet erroneously portrayed as Muhammad's home and the birthplace of <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> order to provide the religion with Arabian origins. Holland argues that in doing so, the faith was dissociated from the Jewish or Christian heritage that would have been self evident at a location in the Negev.|$|E
5|$|In Yemen and Hadramaut, {{much of the}} {{population}} adhered to Shia <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> its Zaydi form. The inhabitants of Upper Mesopotamia were made up of Sunni Muslim Kurds and Turks, {{although there was a}} significant Yazidi minority in that region as well. Jews were spread throughout the Islamic world and most Ayyubid cities had Jewish communities due to the important roles Jews played in trade, manufacture, finance, and medicine. In Yemen and some parts of Syria, Jews also lived in rural towns. The Ayyubid emir of Yemen in 1197–1202, al-Malik Mu'izz Isma'il, attempted to forcibly convert the Jews of Aden, but this process ceased after his death in 1202. Within the Jewish community, particularly in Egypt and Palestine, there existed a minority of Karaites.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Great War, the Roman Catholic Church encountered great difficulties in the region. There was insufficient staffing, the cost of living was rising, and the harsh climate began to wear on the buildings. In 1920, the diocese had, in addition to Carabane, thirteen churches and approximately thirty-five chapels. The thirteen churches were located in Dakar, Saint-Louis, Gorée, Rufisque, Thiès, Ngazobil, Joal, Fadiouth, Foundiougne, Kaolack, Ziguinchor, Bignona and Banjul. In 1922, the Governor decreed which buildings were authorized to practise Catholicism. While the Carabane church was one of the buildings selected, some members blamed the colonial administration for having facilitated the expansion of <b>Islam</b> <b>in</b> the country.|$|E
40|$|As <b>Islam’s</b> {{visibility}} <b>in</b> {{global society}} increases, Muslim populations grow, and Muslim countries compete {{to take up}} positions {{at the heart of}} global sport, the interplay between sport and Islam becomes ever more illuminating. Sport <b>in</b> <b>Islam</b> and <b>in</b> Muslim Communities is the first book to analyse this relationship through a pluralist lens, exploring the questions it raises about contemporary Islam, globalisation, and the challenges faced by (in particular young) Muslims in negotiating their place in global society. With contributions from Muslim and non-Muslim authors, the book approaches an array of contemporary issues, from the role of sport in gender, youth and political identities <b>in</b> <b>Islam</b> and Muslim societies to sport policy in Muslim countries, sport’s role among Muslim minorities and sport marketing’s relationship to Muslim cultures. Drawing on sociology, anthropology, political science, Islamic studies and sport studies, Sport <b>in</b> <b>Islam</b> and <b>in</b> Muslim Communities not only examines the significance of sport <b>in</b> <b>Islam,</b> but helps to draw wider conclusions on religious identity in sporting settings and the interplay between sport, gender, political ideology and consumer culture...|$|R
