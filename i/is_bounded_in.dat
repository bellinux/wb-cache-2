Since the 2008 election, the western and southern boundary followed Main North Road, Marshland Road, North Parade, Dudley Creek, the Avon River, Keyes Road and Pages Road, before cutting though the Bromley wastewater treatment plant to Cuthberts Road.

The proatlas, an atrophied vertebra positioned {{in front of the}} atlas, <b>is</b> <b>bounded</b> <b>in</b> front by top sides of the foramen magnum. While it is difficult to say much about the atlas itself due to damage, the immediately following axis has a relatively short centrum, which is slightly compressed on its sides and bottom. Overall, the remainder of the cervical vertebrae are relatively short, being only 2.5 to 3 times {{as long as they are}} tall; they become increasingly shorter towards the back of the neck, like Lufengosaurus. Other basal sauropodomorphs, including Jingshanosaurus, have cervical vertebrae that are generally 3 to 4 times as long as they are tall. On the bottom of the centra of cervical vertebrae 4-9, there is a prominent keel as in Lufengosaurus, Jingshanosaurus, and other basal sauropodomorphs. Near the back of the neck, the neural spines become somewhat table-like.|$|E

The town is effectively divided into north and south parts by the railway line. The north is predominantly residential, with the southern part containing the main shopping area. Further south it becomes predominantly residential again.
