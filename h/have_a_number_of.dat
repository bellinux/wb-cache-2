5|$|Most Nahuatl {{varieties}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> ways {{to alter}} the valency of a verb. Classical Nahuatl had a passive voice (also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice), {{but this is not}} found in most modern varieties. However the applicative and causative voices are found in many modern dialects. Many Nahuatl varieties also allow forming verbal compounds with two or more verbal roots.|$|E

5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E
5|$|ASL signs <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> phonemic components, {{including}} {{movement of}} the face and torso {{as well as the}} hands. ASL is not a form of pantomime, but iconicity does play a larger role in ASL than in spoken languages. English loan words are often borrowed through fingerspelling, although ASL grammar is unrelated to that of English. ASL has verbal agreement and aspectual marking and has a productive system of forming agglutinative classifiers. Many linguists believe ASL to be a subject–verb–object (SVO) language, but there are several alternative proposals to account for ASL word order.|$|E

5|$|Each {{of these}} priests, either as secular clergy, or as previously, {{members of a}} {{religious}} order, is obligated to say the “Holy Office” every day. To this end, cathedrals normally <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> small chapels used for private devotion or for small groups. In England {{there is a strong}} tradition that each chapel should face the east. For this reason the transepts of English cathedrals are longer than those in most other countries, and there is often a second transept, as at Salisbury. This arrangement permits a greater number of eastward-facing chapels. That part of the main interior which is furthest to the east and reserved for the prayers of the clergy is the presbytery.|$|E
5|$|Global {{warming is}} {{expected}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> negative long-term ecological impacts on the region, including drought, increased forest fires, forest degradation to drought and disease, and less healthy or nonexistent salmon runs. The distribution and survival of plant species, especially those that inhabit alpine environments, as well as animals that are specifically adapted to those environments, will also be adversely affected. Glaciers are also expected to recede due to a decreased buildup of snowpack and higher overall temperatures.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the lungs also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> other functions. They are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure {{as part of the}} renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by expelling carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{physiological}} and anatomical features {{to overcome the}} unique challenges associated with aquatic living. Some of these features are very species specific. Marine mammals have developed a number of features for efficient locomotion such as torpedo shaped bodies to reduce drag; modified limbs for propulsion and steering; tail flukes and dorsal fins for propulsion and balance. Marine mammals are adept at thermoregulation using dense fur or blubber, circulatory adjustments (counter-current heat exchangers); torpedo shaped bodies, reduced appendages, and large size to prevent heat loss.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the film}} would not feature any songs, the {{directors}} hired James Newton Howard to compose the score. Approaching it as a live-action film, Howard {{decided to have}} different musical themes for the cultures of the surface world and Atlantis. In the case of Atlantis, Howard chose an Indonesian orchestral sound incorporating chimes, bells, and gongs. The directors told Howard that the film would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> key scenes without dialogue; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was seeing on screen.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species have}} paired {{cerebral}} organs, sacs whose only openings {{are to the}} outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs {{on the front of}} their heads. Some have slits {{along the side of the}} head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be chemoreceptors, and the cerebral organs may also aiding osmoregulation. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors. On their head some species <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pigment-cup ocelli, which can detect light but not form an image. Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some have hundreds. A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have statocysts, which sense balance.|$|E
5|$|The {{demise of}} the last of the steam {{locomotives}} in Victoria commenced in the 1960s, with the Australian Railway Historical Society and Association of Railway Enthusiasts working with the Victorian Railways to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> locomotives preserved for the future. In 1962 the Australian Railway Historical Society Museum was established at Williamstown North to house static exhibits, and Steamrail Victoria was formed in 1965 to assist in the restoration of locomotives and carriages for use on special trains.|$|E

5|$|Certain areas did {{not report}} their income to the Exchequer, so they do not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, unless the lands were in the king's custody through a vacancy. These {{included}} the palatinates of Durham and Chester. The county of Cornwall also did not usually appear in the Pipe rolls, {{but it was not}} a palatinate. Another problem with using the Pipe rolls for historical study is the fact that the chronological limits for the financial year varied from roll to roll. In theory, they only recorded revenues from the previous Easter to Michaelmas of that financial year. However, the Pipe rolls often record payments made past Michaelmas, often up until the date the roll was actually compiled. Also, a few debts were not audited annually, but would instead <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> consecutive years be investigated in one sitting and thus several years of payments would be recorded in one Pipe roll.|$|E
5|$|La Rose and La Marguerite are rival {{societies}} that commemorate the Anglo-French {{heritage of the}} island; the factions represent the warring colonial powers, between whose hands Saint Lucia changed fourteen times. La Rose is held on August 30 while La Margurite is held on October 17. The societies {{date back to the}} early 19th century, when each village was home to competing organizations of the Roman Catholic Church. Both societies draw on English royalty traditions and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> positions, including the King, Queen, Prince, Princess and various lower titles like the Chief of Police and nurse. La Rose and La Marguerite meet once weekly except during Lent. At these meetings, which are on Saturday for La Rose and Sunday for La Marguerite, members sing or play instruments and dance. La Marguerite meetings feature the membership in a seat chorus with a leader, the chantwèl, standing, while La Rose meetings include instruments like the tanbouwen (tambourine), baha (wooden trumpet), chakchak (rattles), guitar and gwaj (scraper).|$|E
5|$|Most {{worker and}} soldier {{termites}} are completely blind {{as they do}} not have a pair of eyes. However, some species, such as Hodotermes mossambicus, have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates have eyes along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped labrum and a clypeus; the clypeus is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape, a pedicel (typically shorter than the scape), and the flagellum (all segments beyond the scape and pedicel). The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling.|$|E
