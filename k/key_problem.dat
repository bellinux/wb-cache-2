5|$|Responsibility for the {{development}} and testing of the critical detonators was shared between Lauritsen's group at Caltech and Robert Henderson's group at Los Alamos. By mid-1945, the object was to produce 1,000 detonators each week. Meeting this target proved challenging. Reliability was the <b>key</b> <b>problem,</b> with initial batches containing unacceptably high numbers of failures. In May 1945, a box of detonators manufactured by Raytheon fell from a truck and tumbled down a mountain side, but were found to still be in working order.|$|E
5|$|Control {{systems have}} a need for {{smoothing}} filters in their feedback loops with criteria to maximise the speed of movement of a mechanical system to the prescribed mark {{and at the same}} time minimise overshoot and noise induced motions. A <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> here is the extraction of Gaussian signals from a noisy background. An early paper on this was published during WWII by Norbert Wiener with the specific application to anti-aircraft fire control analogue computers. Rudy Kalman (Kalman filter) later reformulated this in terms of state-space smoothing and prediction where it is known as the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem. Kalman started an interest in state-space solutions, but according to Darlington this approach can also be found in the work of Heaviside and earlier.|$|E

25|$|Hominization, in both {{science and}} religion, {{involves}} the process or {{the purpose of}} becoming human. The process and means by which hominization occurs is a <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> in theistic evolutionary thought, {{at least for the}} Abrahamic religions, which hold as a core belief that animals do not have immortal souls but that humans do.

25|$|What {{remained}} now was {{the development}} of a suitable system for delaying the signal on demand, thereby allowing the direction of the beam to be scanned. The <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> was to change the speed of the signal on demand so the phase could be adjusted. After several concepts, the team finally settled on a wave-guide consisting of two parallel plates with overlapping barriers on the vertical sides (the front and back of the wave-guide). By mechanically varying the spacing between the two plates, the speed of propagation along the waveguide changed, and steering was achieved.|$|E

A <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> was the position of Georgia's many ethnic minorities (making up 30% of the population). Although minority groups had participated actively in Georgia's return to democracy, they were underrepresented in {{the results of the}} October 1990 elections with only nine of 245 deputies being non-Georgians. Even before Georgia's independence, the position of national minorities was contentious and led to outbreaks of serious inter-ethnic violence in Abkhazia during 1989.|$|E
25|$|Park51 {{would have}} {{replaced}} an existing 1850s building of Italianate style that was damaged in the September 11 attacks. The original design included a 500-seat auditorium, theater, performing arts center, fitness center, swimming pool, basketball court, childcare area, bookstore, culinary school, art studio, food court, and {{memorial to the}} victims of the September 11 attacks. It also included a prayer space for the Muslim community to accommodate 1,000–2,000 people. Park51 was designed by the Principal of SOMA, Michel Abboud, who wrestled for months with a <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> to make the building fit naturally into its surrounds in lower Manhattan: on the one hand, it should have a contemporary design, and, at the same time, it should look Islamic.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{problems}} with the Embedded SQL approach. Like the different varieties of SQL, the Embedded SQLs that used them varied widely, not only from platform to platform, but even across languages on one platform – a system that allowed calls into IBM's DB2 would look very different from one that called into their own SQL/DS. Another <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> to the Embedded SQL concept was that the SQL code could only be changed in the program's source code, so that even small changes to the query required considerable programmer effort to modify. The SQL market referred to this as static SQL, versus dynamic SQL which could be changed at any time, like the command-line interfaces that shipped with almost all SQL systems, or a programming interface that left the SQL as plain text until it was called. Dynamic SQL systems became a major focus for SQL vendors during the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of leaving King's College for Birkbeck College, Franklin was asked by John Randall {{to give up her}} work on DNA. When it became clear to Wilkins and the {{supervisors}} of Watson and Crick that Franklin was going to the new job, and that Linus Pauling was working on the structure of DNA, they were willing to share Franklin's data with Watson and Crick, in the hope that they could find a good model of DNA before Pauling was able. Franklin's X-ray diffraction data for DNA and her systematic analysis of DNA's structural features was useful to Watson and Crick in guiding them towards a correct molecular model. The <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> for Watson and Crick, which could not be resolved by the data from King's College, was to guess how the nucleotide bases pack into the core of the DNA double helix.|$|E
25|$|FCC proponents {{argue that}} {{menstruation}} became a <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> because it potentially creates {{conflicts between the}} females and conflicts between males. Menstruation has little social impact among chimpanzees or bonobos, since visible oestrus swellings {{are the focus of}} male attention. But once external signs of ovulation had been phased out in the human lineage, according to FCC, menstruation became salient as the one remaining external promise of fertility. Potentially, dominant males might exploit such information, repeatedly targeting newly cycling females at the expense of pregnant or nursing mothers (figure e). Those who might lose male investment needed to take control. According to FCC, older and more experienced females did this by initiating newly cycling females into their kin-based coalitions (figures f, g). Red ochre pigments allowed women to take conscious control over their signals, resisting any dominant male strategy of picking and choosing between them on biological grounds. It is argued that because precise, sustained menstrual synchrony is difficult to achieve, painting up with blood-red pigments was the next best thing, enabling the benefits of artificial, ritually constructed synchrony.|$|E
25|$|Accelerator-based light-ion fusion is a {{technique}} using particle accelerators to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce light-ion fusion reactions. Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and {{can be done in}} an efficient manner—requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting bremsstrahlung radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube neutron generators are particularly relevant to this discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves.|$|E

500|$|The {{coalfield}} had {{a relatively}} low population density {{and did not have}} a major coal-consuming industry nearby. Transporting coal to market was a <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> for the coalfield's development. In the pre-turnpike era, the roads serving the coalfield were unsuited to moving coal. Bulley notes [...] "The problem... was rendered far worse by the state of the roads in Somerset, which were notorious down {{to the middle of the}} 18th century. Parishes in the area sometimes neglected or refused to repair those roads which were heavily used by coal carts. Thus in 1617 the inhabitants of Stoke St Michael... complained that [...] "of late by reason of many coalmines... the highways there are much in decay and grown very founderous".|$|E
500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} by Kurt's storyline in {{the episode}} [...] "Never Been Kissed".

Leah Anthony Libresco of the Huffington Post called the episode [...] "extraordinarily counterproductive", and disapproved of Will treating Kurt's upset as the <b>key</b> <b>problem,</b> rather than the unchecked bullying provoking it. She found Blaine's advice to Kurt [...] "misleading and dangerous", especially the suggestion that targeted children should {{be held responsible for}} confronting their attackers and putting themselves at risk of further injury, rather than for protecting themselves. Poniewozik noted that the storyline was inherently flawed, as the show had previously treated bullying in a light-hearted rather than serious manner, but said that its saving grace was the focus it placed on Colfer: [...] "probably the strongest actor with the most interesting character among the Glee kids".|$|E
500|$|At 00:45, {{lifeboat}} No. 7 was rowed {{away from}} Titanic with 28passengers on board (despite {{a capacity of}} 65). Lifeboat No. 6, on the port side, was the next to be lowered at 00:55.

Lightoller realised {{there was only one}} seaman on board (Quartermaster Robert Hichens) and called for volunteers. Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club stepped forward and climbed down a rope into the lifeboat; he was the only male passenger whom Lightoller allowed to board during the port side evacuation. Peuchen's role highlighted a <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> during the evacuation: there were hardly any seamen to man the boats. Some had been sent below to open gangway doors to allow more passengers to be evacuated, but they never returned. They were presumably trapped and drowned by the rising water below decks.|$|E
40|$|Algorithmic {{research}} {{strives to}} develop fast algorithms for fundamental problems. Despite its many successes, however, many problems {{still do not}} have very efficient algorithms. For years researchers have explained the hardness for <b>key</b> <b>problems</b> by proving NP-hardness, utilizing polynomial time reductions to base the hardness of <b>key</b> <b>problems</b> on the famous conjecture P != NP. For problems that already have polynomial time algorithms, however, {{it does not seem}} that one can show any sort of hardness based on P != NP. Nevertheless, we would like to provide evidence that a problem $A$ with a running time O(n^k) that has not been improved in decades, also requires n^{k-o(1) } time, thus explaining the lack of progress on the problem. Such unconditional time lower bounds seem very difficult to obtain, unfortunately. Recent work has concentrated on an approach mimicking NP-hardness: (1) select a few <b>key</b> <b>problems</b> that are conjectured to require T(n) time to solve, (2) use special, fine-grained reductions to prove time lower bounds for many diverse problems in P based on the conjectured hardness of the <b>key</b> <b>problems.</b> In this abstract we outline the approach, give some examples of hardness results based on the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis, and present an overview of some of the recent work on the topic...|$|R

500|$|Raiden's {{replacement}} of fan favorite Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid 2 proved controversial, and GamesRadar considered the event {{a reason to}} dislike the series overall. The same site criticized his role in Metal Gear Solid 2 several times, and called his inclusion {{one of the worst}} aspects of the game. In 2004, GameAxis Unwired published a fake interview in which Hideo Kojima expressed regret for creating the character. While calling Metal Gear Solid 2 one of the biggest disappointments in video-game history, UGO Networks' Marissa Meli cited Raiden's debut as a <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> with the game. Meli also commented on Raiden's design, placing him 12th in a list of the most androgynous video game characters. The book Playing with Videogames states that Raiden's inclusion was to surprise Metal Gear fans who, instead of playing as Snake, played as his opposite. Writer James Newman commented that fans' reactions were highly negative, as though their expectations had been [...] "betray" [...] by Kojima. He compared Raiden to the controversial Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks. Trailers for Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater (in which Raiden is mocked) were considered by Newman to be Konami's comic response to fans' disapproval. Raiden proved to be more popular in Japan, with Yoji Shinkawa commenting it was because he matched the stereotype of manga hero. In 2012, manga artist Hiro Mashima drew an illustration of Raiden in anticipation of the series' following games. He mentioned having had difficulties illustrating the character.|$|E
500|$|Due to [...] "protective and {{occasionally}} nervous" [...] fans, Kripke meant for Bela {{to be introduced}} in [...] "small doses". He wanted fans to know the show would always be just about Sam and Dean Winchester, and stated, [...] " [...] there for important plot elements, but it's not the Ruby and Bela show, nor {{is it about the}} four of them cruising around in the Impala together. It's about the guys." [...] However, he felt the writers pushed it too far in the episode [...] "Red Sky at Morning", stating his opinion that it [...] "was by far the least successful episode this year because it really kind of became the Bela show". The writers also did not take the time to consider how to tie her into the Winchesters' storylines. As Kripke pointed out, [...] "It's a road show and we're in a different town every week, so if you're going to run into the same character over and over again, you better have a damn good reason..." [...] They were eventually [...] "crushed {{under the weight of the}} absurdity of it" [...] because it became more difficult to justify her reappearances within the narrative. Another <b>key</b> <b>problem</b> stemmed from their conceptualization of her as an antagonistic character rather than a potential love interest for the brothers. The writers, [...] "so taken with a woman who could screw the boys over at every turn", ended up making Bela too antagonistic without establishing a balance. Any chance for a [...] "funny effervescent episode where they all work together" [...] was lost after the character attempts to have the Winchesters killed on multiple occasions. They eventually decided to drop the character from the series, opting to [...] "send her off in an appropriate and dramatic way" [...] which would [...] "show a couple of cards [...] been holding onto all season" [...] by revealing her backstory [...] "in a way that will surprise the audience and kind of tie her into the story." ...|$|E
