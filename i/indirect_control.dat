When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944.

40|$|This study investigates how nation-level {{cultural}} values (‘individualism’ and ‘collectivism’) and intra-organizational task control mechanisms influence {{the level of}} organizations’ use of formal telework practices. Employing a multi-level analysis on survey data (2009 / 10), including 1577 organizations within 18 nations, we found that ‘high use of formal telework practices in organizations’ was more likely when: (1) organizations operated in nations characterized by strong national values; and when they employed (2) ‘hard’ <b>indirect</b> <b>controls</b> (i. e. individual performance-related pay and 360 º performance-evaluations). High telework use was less likely when organizations employed direct controls (i. e. higher proportions of managers) and ‘soft’ <b>indirect</b> <b>controls</b> (i. e. higher proportions of professionals). ‘Low use of formal telework practices’ was more likely when organizations employed ‘soft’ <b>indirect</b> <b>controls.</b> Our findings suggest that national {{cultural values}} can function as ‘soft’ <b>indirect</b> <b>controls</b> to mitigate the ‘telework risk’ of high levels of telework practices. Internal ‘soft’ task controls only sufficed for managing low levels of telework practices. We discuss the smart and dark sides of telework and how these relate to the management of telework practice.

40|$|This study investigates {{a hybrid}} {{adaptive}} flight control method as a design possibility {{for a flight}} control system that can enable an effective adaptation strategy to deal with off-nominal flight conditions. The hybrid adaptive control blends both direct and <b>indirect</b> adaptive <b>control</b> in a model inversion flight control architecture. The blending of both direct and <b>indirect</b> adaptive <b>control</b> provides a much more flexible and effective adaptive flight control architecture than that with either direct or <b>indirect</b> adaptive <b>control</b> alone. The <b>indirect</b> adaptive <b>control</b> is used to update the model inversion controller by an on-line parameter estimation of uncertain plant dynamics based on two methods. The first parameter estimation method is an indirect adaptive law based on the Lyapunov theory, and the second method is a recursive least-squares indirect adaptive law. The model inversion controller is therefore made to adapt {{to changes in the}} plant dynamics due to uncertainty. As a result, the modeling error is reduced that directly leads to a decrease in the tracking error. In conjunction with the <b>indirect</b> adaptive <b>control</b> that updates the model inversion controller, a direct adaptive control is implemented as an augmented command to further reduce any residual tracking error that is not entirely eliminated by the <b>indirect</b> adaptive <b>control...</b>|$|R

Many schemes {{have been proposed}} for the speed control of induction motor drives, among which the <b>indirect</b> vector <b>control</b> is most effective method. An <b>indirect</b> vector <b>controlled</b> induction motor drive performance is poor with two-level inverter. To overcome these problems three-level cascade inverter is used. Space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) method is employed to control three-level cascade inverter. Conventional <b>indirect</b> vector <b>control</b> of induction motor drive uses hysteresis current controller, which causes variable switching frequency of the inverter.

Drawing inspiration from the literature on eliciting behavior change in organizations, this identifies that the shift from direct controls (deterrents and incentives) to <b>indirect</b> <b>controls</b> (which engender a commitment to individual self-governance) can be scaled up to the societallevel to elicit behavior change in relation to undeclared work. To shift towards the pursuit of individual self-governance as a means of achieving collective self-governance, a multi-pronged approach is called for which seeks to change both the codified laws and regulations of formal institutions and the norms, values and beliefs that constitute the informal institutions of a society in order to create symmetry between them. The paper concludes by discussing the various ways of combining and sequencing direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>controls</b> in a manner that foregrounds the centrality of individual self-governance to the achievement of collective self-governance...|$|R

Rockefeller finally gave up his dream of controlling all the world's oil refining, he admitted later, [...] "We realized that public sentiment would be against us if we actually refined all the oil." [...] Over time foreign competition and new finds abroad eroded his dominance. In the early 1880s, Rockefeller created one of his most important innovations. Rather than try to influence the price of crude oil directly, Standard Oil had been exercising <b>indirect</b> <b>control</b> by altering oil storage charges to suit market conditions. Rockefeller then ordered the issuance of certificates against oil stored in its pipelines.
