5|$|Historically {{influenced}} by Chinese law, the Japanese legal system developed independently during the Edo period through texts such as Kujikata Osadamegaki. However, {{since the late}} 19th century the judicial system has been largely based on the civil law of Europe, notably Germany. For example, in 1896, the Japanese government established a civil code based on {{a draft of the}} German Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch; with the code remaining in <b>effect</b> <b>with</b> post–World War II modifications. Statutory law originates in Japan's legislature and has the rubber stamp of the Emperor. Japan's court system is divided into four basic tiers: the Supreme Court and three levels of lower courts. The main body of Japanese statutory law is called the Six Codes.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the storms}} {{originated}} from the intertropical convergence zone. In late December into early January, tropical storms Bentha and Christelle persisted {{to the east}} of Madagascar, undergoing the Fujiwhara <b>effect</b> <b>with</b> each other. Later in January, Dorina became the second of three intense tropical cyclones, but weakened before passing near Rodrigues. Tropical Depression Eliceca and Tropical Storm Fodah both formed in the Mozambique Channel toward the end of January, bringing gusty winds and rainfall to the region. In February, Gail produced gusty winds on Rodrigues, and Tropical Storm Heida entered the basin from Australian region. Later in the month, Ingrid brought strong winds to Mauritius. Tropical storms Josta and Kylie developed toward the beginning of March from the same overall system, affecting Madagascar and Réunion, respectively. After they dissipated, Tropical Depression Lidy caused flooding and damage on Rodrigues due to heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual <b>effect,</b> <b>with</b> indicator lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the gunpowder would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated gunpowder, of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated gunpowder would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon <b>effect,</b> <b>with</b> the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of gunpowder, had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E

5|$|While near peak intensity, Typhoon Fengshen {{underwent}} the Fujiwhara <b>effect</b> <b>with</b> Typhoon Fung-wong, {{causing the}} latter storm to loop to its south. Fengshen gradually weakened while approaching Japan, and it {{crossed over the}} country's Ōsumi Islands on July25 as a severe tropical storm. The typhoon washed a freighter ashore, killing four people and forcing the other 15crew members to be rescued. In the country, Fengshen dropped heavy rainfall that caused mudslides and left $4million (¥475million 2002JPY), in crop damage. There was an additional death in the country. After affecting Japan, Fengshen weakened in the Yellow Sea to a tropical depression, before moving across China's Shandong Peninsula and dissipating on July28.|$|E
5|$|A {{small area}} of {{convection}} not associated from the ITCZ became Tropical Disturbance 10 on April1, about 215km (350mi) west-northwest of the Cocos Islands in the Australian region. It moved west-southwestward, entering the south-west Indian Ocean on April2, {{and on the}} same date the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. The thunderstorms organized into a small central dense overcast, and there was evidence of an eye feature, suggesting the system could have been much stronger. Although satellite imagery had difficulty in tracking the low-level circulation, a nearby ship on April3 confirmed {{the presence of a}} circulation. Operationally the system was only classified as a tropical depression. However, data from QuikSCAT helped upgrade the system to moderate tropical storm status in a post-season analysis, with peak winds of 65km/h (40mph) on April3; as a result, it was not named. After previously moving to the west-southwest, the small storm turned back to the west due to a strengthening ridge to the south. Wind shear increased on April4, which rapidly dwindled the convection and thereby leaving behind an exposed circulation. It underwent the Fujiwhara <b>effect</b> <b>with</b> a larger disturbance to the east, causing the system to turn back to the north and dissipate on April5.|$|E

5|$|After the shakyōjo {{closed at}} the end of the 8th century, the {{imperial}} family and leading aristocrats continued to sponsor sutra copying. Because of an enhanced belief in the powers of the Lotus Sutra, more Heian period copies of this sutra exist than of all other sutras combined. Starting in the early Heian period, styles became flowery and ornate with lavish decorations as sutras were not used only in recitation but for dedication and sacrifice. Devotional sutra copying was more often undertaken by the initiator than in the Nara period. New forms of decoration came in fashion by the early-11th century including placing each character in the outline of a stupa, on lotus pedestals or next to depictions of Boddhisattvas. Sutras were increasingly furnished with frontispieces starting in the 11th century. Calligraphy shifted from Chinese to Japanese style. Sutra copying continued into the Kamakura and subsequent periods, but only rarely to comparable artistic <b>effect.</b> <b>With</b> the import of printed Song editions in the Kamakura period, hand-copying of the complete scriptures died out and sutra copying was only practiced for its devotional aspect. Forty-six sutras or sets of sutras from the 6th century Western Wei to 14th century Nanboku-chō period have been designated National Treasures. Some of the oldest items in this list originated in China.|$|E
5|$|Although Fausto headed {{generally}} northwest while {{a tropical}} cyclone, it curved west-northwest after degenerating into a remnant low. Passing several hundred {{miles north of}} Hawaii, deep convection began to re-develop as the remnants of Fausto interacted with a tropical upper tropospheric trough. By 1800 UTC on August28, the low had enough deep convection to be reclassified as a tropical depression while located roughly 635mi (1020km) north of Oahu. No further re-intensification occurred for almost 48 hours, and then Fausto became a tropical storm again at 1800 UTC September1. This regeneration at high latitude was attributed to a temperature anomaly with waters 3.4°F (2°C) above normal and a favorable upper-level atmospheric pattern. Although sea surface temperature anomalies are usually attributed {{to the development of}} an El Niño, the El Niño had no <b>effect</b> <b>with</b> atmospheric conditions. A mid-latitude cyclone approached Tropical Storm Fausto and caused the system to accelerate northward. The mid-latitude cyclone eventually absorbed Fausto, and the combined system reached the Aleutian Islands of Alaska shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but they no longer had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little <b>effect,</b> <b>with</b> only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E
