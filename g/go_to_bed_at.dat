25|$|The film is grandiose, horrible, showing monstrous crimes...regrettably, {{the film}} {{people here are}} putting me under {{pressure}} to finish {{the whole thing in}} ten days even though the film is barely finished. I hope I can get it all together.

50|$|As {{circadian}} rhythm {{is independent of}} the number of hours of sleep a person needs, Roenneberg calculates the rhythm based on the midpoint of the sleep period. A person who <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> midnight and rises at 8 thus has the same chronotype as a person who <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> 1 a.m. and rises at 7; the midpoint of sleep is 4 a.m. for both of these individuals.|$|R

He would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> 12:30 am after saying a prayer. [...] "Quite a good prayer, unselfish too", he told the Sunday Times. [...] "It is a sort of {{acknowledgment}} of God, just in case there happens to be one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burns went on {{to repeat}} his [...] "taxicab driver" [...] analogy several times {{over the next few}} days. On August 27, 2006 in Butte, Burns said: [...] "This {{campaign}} is about the next generation; it is if we have a safe world and a secure world where our kids can <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> night and not worry about a guy that drives a taxicab in the daytime and kills at night." ...|$|E
2500|$|The BBC {{announced}} Paxman's {{departure from}} Newsnight {{at the end}} of April 2014.

60|$|Having {{made this}} {{contribution}} to the general cheerfulness, Clovis <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>At</b> long intervals the {{various members of the}} house-party followed his example.|$|R
60|$|He <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> eleven o'clock, and at {{a quarter}} past, clad all too lightly for the job, sped rapidly downstairs to admit his wife.|$|R

2500|$|The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch {{told how}} some Jews emulate Jacob's action in [...] by {{sleeping}} with a stone under their head on Tisha B'Av, the annual fast day {{to commemorate the}} destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch taught that on Tisha B'Av, people should make themselves uncomfortable when they <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> night. If they are used to sleeping with two pillows, on Tisha B'Av, they should sleep on one. The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch reported that some thus have the custom on the night of Tisha B'Av of sleeping on the ground with a stone under their head as a reminder of what [...] says of Jacob: [...] "He took from the stones of the place." [...] The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch told that on that night, Jacob had a vision of {{the destruction of the}} Temple and said (in the words of [...] ), [...] "How awesome is this place." ...|$|E

So turn off the TV set, put the video game away. Buy a little desk or put that child by the kitchen table. Watch them do their homework. If they don't know how to do it, give them help. If you don't know how to do it, call the teacher. Make them <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> a {{reasonable}} time. Keep them off the streets. Give 'em some breakfast... I also know that if folks letting our children drink eight sodas a day, which some parents do, or, you know, eat a bag of potato chips for lunch, or Popeyes for breakfast [...] You can't do that. Children have to have proper nutrition. That affects also how they study, how they learn in school." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him anxiously. 'I think you had better <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> once,' she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am all right. I {{spent the}} evening in my rooms and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> eleven o'clock. Who's lunching with you? I see {{the table is}} laid for two." ...|$|R
60|$|When the bagpiper had thus {{concluded}} {{his business}} he <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> his inn. And {{for the first}} time during three months the people of Hamel slept quietly through the night.|$|R
60|$|That {{night they}} all <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> nine, except Carl, {{who was already}} keeping vigil on the tombstone. Una slipped in to bid him good night. Her tender heart was wrung with sympathy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Without his supper, I say," [...] {{repeated}} Judith inexorably. [...] "Lionel Hezekiah, go up-stairs to {{the south}} room, and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> once." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He wouldn't <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> all. I {{guess he}} sat up all night in the public parlor. He wasn't in bed at twelve o'clock: I know that." ...|$|E
60|$|Lionel Hezekiah went up-stairs, and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> once. He {{was never}} sulky or disobedient. Salome {{listened to him}} as he stumped patiently up-stairs with a sob at every step, and her own eyes filled with tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "No luck, sir," [...] he announced. [...] "I {{spent the}} whole of last night <b>at</b> it, too--never <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> all. I've tried it with thirty-one codes. Then I've taken the first line or two and tried every {{possible}} change." ...|$|R

60|$|She <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> last {{with the}} babies, {{and with their}} soft, warm little bodies {{touching}} her side fell asleep, pondering, suffering as only a mother and wife can suffer when distrust and doubt of her husband supplant confidence and adoration.|$|R

60|$|Later, {{when all}} had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> the mill, George and I sat {{together}} {{on opposite sides}} of the fire, smoking, saying little. He was casting up the total of discrepancies, and now and again he ejaculated one of his thoughts.|$|R

60|$|Harris said {{he thought}} it would be humpy. He said he knew the sort of place I meant; where {{everybody}} <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> eight o’clock, and you couldn’t get a Referee for love or money, and had to walk ten miles to get your baccy.|$|R
6000|$|... "'What can I do? What can I do?' Mrs. 'Gator {{kept saying}} over and over. 'However can I keep them warm when Mr. Sun <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> <b>at</b> night? Oh, dear! Oh, dear! My {{beautiful}} eggs never, never {{will turn to}} darling babies! What can I do?' ...|$|R
