5000|$|... 45 has a {{relatively}} close statistical relationship with Codex Washingtonianus in Mark, however, {{and to a}} lesser extent Family 13. Citing Larry <b>Hurtado's</b> study, Text-Critical Methodology and the Pre-Caesarean Text: Codex W in the Gospel of Mark, Eldon Jay Epp has agreed that there is no connection to a Caesarean or pre-Caesarean text in Mark. There is also not a strong connection to the Neutral text of Codex Vaticanus, the Western text of Codex Bezae, and the Byzantine text of the textus receptus. Another hypothesis is that 45 comes from the Alexandrian tradition, but has many readings intended to [...] "improve" [...] the text stylistically, and a number of harmonizations. While still difficult to place historically in a category of texts, most scholars today agree that the text is not Caesarean, contrary to Kenyon.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hurtado's</b> view {{might be}} {{interpreted}} as urging that, {{at this stage of}} the development of the Church's understanding, it could be said that God is a person (the Father), and one being; and that Jesus is distinct from the Father, was pre-existent with God, and also originating from God without becoming a being separate from him, so that he is God (the Son). This view of a binitarian pattern of devotion would posit a unity of God's being, and a oneness of the object of worship, which is sympathetic to its predecessor view in Judaism; and it also displays a plurality of simultaneous identities which is sympathetic to its successor in trinitarianism. It is a development of understanding of Christ, in other words, from which arose several understandings in the course of development, that eventually came into conflict with one another.|$|R
