25|$|I didn't {{play that}} well in {{stages of the}} tour and other players {{deserved}} a game. But we got to halfway through the tour and (captain) Greg Chappell {{came to me and}} said there was trouble at the top of the order and asked if I would like to open the batting in the county games. I did that and I was quite successful. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> the end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
500|$|At Paleyfest {{in early}} 2007, Steve Carell later {{recalled}} that {{he enjoyed the}} episode [...] "because it spoke {{to the fact that}} Michael is not a homophobe; he just doesn't understand the world. They are two very different things. It's not that he's intrinsically racist or homophobic or sexist, he just doesn't have a frame of reference. He's not capable of understanding. And once he does glean some understanding he misinterprets it into something altogether. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> least the way I feel about the character is he's a decent heart, a decent person and he's just trying his best." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} on 13 November, Angus Young stated that the band had experienced problems with Rudd {{earlier in the year}} when recording Rock or Bust, and that his situation had taken the band by surprise. Rudd had also missed video and photo shoots, and with reference to Rudd's future in the band, Young added, [...] "So, at this stage, it's a pretty tough call for us." [...] He also said the band would continue: [...] "He's got to sort himself out <b>I</b> <b>think...</b> <b>At</b> this point it's kind of a question mark. But if we're touring, there will be a drummer in place, put it that way." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} restarted in 2005, {{there was}} a more budget-conscious approach to filming The Fountain, whose original budget was mostly intended for visual effects. Libatique reflected, [...] "Visual effects [...] {{a lot of the}} budget in the original conception. The popcorn moments were in there to justify the budget and bring target audiences into the theater. Ultimately, I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to the core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> the end of the day, the theme of the film will be easier to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Fear of Scientology's {{litigiousness}} rendered American networks {{unwilling to}} license any {{material to the}} filmmakers, which Gibney found [...] "astounding". He commented that he [...] "found it interesting that universally this subject — {{more than any other}} — provoked all the networks to decline to license. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> the end of the day, that tells you more about Scientology than it does about the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism." [...] The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: [...] "Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody’s house." ...|$|E

500|$|The win marked Liverpool's third {{consecutive}} victory against Manchester United, but despite this, manager Houllier refused to get carried away: [...] "At the moment I am worried because the team which {{has won the}} Charity Shield {{in recent years has}} not won the title, I don't think you can draw conclusions from this match." [...] Man of the match Sander Westerveld echoed similar sentiments: [...] "It doesn't say too much about the season. Last year Chelsea beat them 2-0 and had high expectations. We played well and it's a good result but it doesn't say anything about the Championship." [...] Questions were asked about the exclusion of striker Robbie Fowler from the match-day squad, with Houllier confirming the striker had been left out after a training ground bust-up with assistant manager Phil Thompson: [...] "It is a regrettable moment for the team and the club but I'm sure at some stage common sense will prevail. I am leaving it to him. I brokered a get-together between Phil and Robbie, which I attended at the beginning. Then I left the two Scousers together. But so far it has been unsuccessful." [...] Houllier added that he had tried to resolve the issue {{before the start of the}} match: [...] "I waited until the Sunday lunchtime before the Charity Shield game. I again insisted yesterday. I took them together again. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> some stage it will be solved. I am a patient man." ...|$|E

2500|$|The City Council was {{considering}} whether to remove the stone {{in order to try}} and stop the bad luck which had struck the city. However Kevin Carlyon, the self-titled [...] "high priest of the British white witches" [...] proclaimed that such actions would give the curse more power. He commented that: [...] "A curse can only work if people believe in it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> the moment the sculpture is a nice piece of history, but if the council destroys it, they would be showing their belief in the curse." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his primary defeat, Mfume was {{believed}} to be considering running for mayor of Baltimore in 2007, though he had not publicly expressed interest in such a run. On November 13, 2006, Mfume told a Baltimore-area radio station that [...] "I don't have any plans to run for mayor. She 's worked for and deserves an opportunity to lead. ... I want her to succeed. I want the city to be united. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> this point we owe her at least the opportunity to try to lead it."

2500|$|After {{ten years}} of living, recording, and touring together, Europe {{decided to take a}} break {{at the end of the}} 1992 tour. [...] "I {{remember}} in the tour bus afterwards we were talking about where the whole thing was going and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> the time the consensus of the band was we really felt ready for a break," [...] Tempest said, [...] "We felt that it was time to put some roots down and I was really into the idea of making my own solo album." [...] In that time, Tempest and Marcello released solo albums whilst the other members participated in several different projects and bands. In return, Europe was dropped from Epic Records.|$|E
2500|$|Evanescence paused their tour to {{take part}} in the Carnival of Madness Tour {{alongside}} Halestorm, Cavo, New Medicine and Chevelle. This tour began on July 31, 2012, in Springfield, Illinois, and ran through September 2, 2012, ending in Buffalo, New York. The Evanescence Tour resumed in October 2012 with stops in South America, Costa Rica and Panama. The tour wrapped with a series of shows in England, ending on November 9, 2012, in London's Wembley Arena. Lee stated the band plans to take an extended break after the tour, saying, [...] "At the end of any really long tour you need to get your head in order. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> the end of the run we'll go on a break for a while and figure things out." ...|$|E

2500|$|Antonin Scalia {{followed}} up by asking if the dealers were lulled by Schmuck regularly passing good title. [...] "hat's been the point <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> which the government's case breaks down," [...] Steinberg told him. [...] "There's nothing about title registration which reassures you the odometer hasn't been tampered with." [...] When Scalia pressed the lawyer on whether Schmuck would be culpable {{if he had}} had to mail the applications himself, Steinberg stood firm. The success of the title applications, he maintained, did {{not depend on the}} odometer readings, although Schmuck might have been committing mail fraud if he had mailed the original odometer slips himself. Scalia said he was contradicting his earlier argument that the mail was utterly irrelevant to the scheme, to which Steinberg said [...] "ou {{have to be able to}} point out how the mailing contributed to the success of the scheme." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Dr. John Lane, {{director}} of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in 1997, although Van Vliet's work has associations with mainstream abstract expressionist painting, more importantly he was a self-taught artist and his painting [...] "has {{that same kind of}} edge the music has". [...] Curator David Breuer asserts that in contrast to the busied, bohemian urban lives of the New York abstract expressionists, the rural desert environment Van Vliet was influenced by is a distinctly naturalistic one, making him a distinguished figure in contemporary art, whose work will survive in canon. Van Vliet stated of his own work, [...] "I'm trying to turn myself inside out on the canvas. I'm trying to completely bare what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> that moment" [...] and that, [...] "I paint {{for the simple reason that}} I have to. I feel a sense of relief after I do." [...] When asked about his artistic influences he stated that there were none. [...] "I just paint like I paint and that's enough influence." [...] He did however state his admiration of Georg Baselitz, the De Stijl artist Piet Mondrian, and Vincent van Gogh; after seeing van Gogh's paintings in person, Van Vliet quoted himself as saying that, [...] "The sun disappoints me so." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} of her life she also was distant from her family, as she had married without their consent. According to Loveless, [...] "...I think my father thought I had lost my mind. This music is going to just ruin your life... it ruined your life... But it was a music that I learned from again... You wouldn't believe the people that would come to this club. They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean there was all walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times I felt myself {{becoming}} one of those people too. There was some hard times for us both, my ex-husband and I. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>at</b> the time, it caused us to be torn apart, and we lost respect for each other. And {{it got to the point}} that we didn't know each other..." [...] A low point of her life was in October 1979, when her father, whom she idolized, died near Louisville while Loveless was in North Carolina.|$|E
