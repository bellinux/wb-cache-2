This study involved the solution of three dimensional partial differential equations {{for the conservation of}} mass, momentum, energy, turbulent energy and its dissipation rate. The finite volume method and the standard (k-ε) turbulence model were employed to solve the governing equations numerically. A modified version of a three dimensional computer program FLUENT (6. 3. 26) was used to simulate the complex flow inside the room. The present computational program was validated by comparing the numerical results with experimental data of other study, This comparison show a good agreement. Two main cases were studied with respect to the number of heat sources which were:- 1. Case I: Includes ventilated room with single heat source and one person. 2. Case II: Includes ventilated room with double heat sources and two persons. The effect of ventilation rate corresponding to supply velocities (0. 25 – 0. 35 m/s) which is recommended by ASHRAE 2007, supply air temperatures (17 & 19 oC) and <b>exhaust</b> <b>grille</b> location on the thermal comfort were investigated based on air distribution performance index (ADPI) in the room. For case I with a heat source of (50 W/m 2) heat rejected, the ventilation rate is equal to (6. 84 ACH), and supply air temperature of (19 oC) is needed to give better thermal comfort with ADPI equal to 83. 6 %. For case II with double heat sources each with (50 W/m 2) heat rejected, (8. 30 ACH) ventilation rate and supply air temperature of (19 oC) were needed to get ADPI equal to 83. 6 %...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, using a newly defined {{cooling coil}} load {{calculation}} method for stratified air distribution (STRAD) systems, {{the effects of}} separate location of the return and <b>exhaust</b> <b>grilles</b> on thermal comfort and energy saving are experimentally investigated. The results clearly demonstrated the extra energy saving potentials for STRAD systems with separate locations of return and <b>exhaust</b> <b>grilles.</b> After using the experimental results to validate our CFD method, numerical investigation is carried out for an office setting. Decreasing the height of return <b>grille</b> will increase <b>exhaust</b> air temperature and significantly reduce the cooling coil load. However, the risk of poor thermal comfort caused by too large temperature difference between the head and foot levels also increased, when the return inlet is located close to the floor level. Locating the <b>exhaust</b> <b>grilles</b> at ceiling level and close to external wall while locating the return grilles at the upper boundary of the occupied zone are recommended in practice. It is demonstrated that the purpose to simultaneously achieve satisfied thermal comfort and prominent energy saving can be attained with a STRAD system via deliberate locations of supply outlets and return and <b>exhaust</b> <b>grilles</b> {{in relation to the}} heat source locations.

50|$|Air {{terminals}} are {{the supply}} air outlets and return or exhaust air inlets. For supply, diffusers are most common, but grilles, and for very small HVAC systems (such as in residences) registers {{are also used}} widely. Return or <b>exhaust</b> <b>grilles</b> are used primarily for appearance reasons, but some also incorporate an air filter and are known as filter returns.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the vehicle was completed in 1983, with a prototype being delivered to the South Korean government in the same year. As mentioned above, however, the AVCR-1790 used for the design was replaced by MTU MB Ka-501 just prior to mass production, {{which resulted in the}} K1's engine deck and <b>exhaust</b> <b>grilles</b> becoming cosmetically similar to the Leopard 2's.|$|R
5000|$|The {{displacement}} outlets {{are usually}} located {{at or near}} the floor with the air supply designed so the air flows smoothly across the floor. Where there is a heat source (such as people, lighting, computers, electrical equipment, etc.) the air will rise, pulling the cool supply air up with it and moving contaminants and heat from the occupied zone to the return or <b>exhaust</b> <b>grilles</b> above. By doing so, the air quality in the occupied zone is generally superior to that achieved with mixing room air distribution.|$|R
40|$|Complaints on {{thermal comfort}} and confusions on cooling load {{calculation}} are still two main {{issues for the}} design of stratified air distribution (STRAD) system. This paper investigated these two issues for STRAD systems applied in a large space lecture theatre. The simulation results revealed that best satisfied thermal environment was obtained when supplied air from floor level, terrace and desk-edge mounted grilles simultaneously. A new method for the calculation of the occupied zone cooling load, which is based on CFD (computational fluid dynamics) simulation was proposed and tried. The effective cooling load factor concept was further clarified, which can be conveniently used to calculate the occupied zone cooling load and then determine the supply airflow rate. The concepts of occupied zone cooling load reduction and the associated but different cooling coil load reduction were differentiated, and it was illustrated that cooling coil load reduction up to 16. 5 % of the space cooling load can be achieved with split location of return and <b>exhaust</b> <b>grilles.</b> These simulation works provide a good basis for full-scale experimental validation of the key energy saving features of a well-designed stratified air distribution system.

5000|$|A common {{piece of}} {{misinformation}} about the preceding PD-4102 model {{is that it}} had the same restyled front end as the later PD-4103 (and 1950 PD-3704) while retaining the old, transit style rear end of the PD-4101. This was given life due to a single (and often photographed) rebuilt PD-4101, owned by Colorado Southern/Burlington Trailways, that had suffered front end damage in a serious wreck. This single coach was rebuilt using a GM Truck and Coach-provided [...] "kit" [...] that gave it the PD-4103 front end. No such combination of PD-4101 rear end and PD-4103 front end was ever released by the GM Truck and Coach factory in Pontiac, MI. The reality was that the PD-4102 and PD-4103 models were virtually indistinguishable from each other except to the trained eye, which would look for the left side rear baggage door, or the <b>exhaust</b> fan <b>grilles</b> on the front interior of the latter model. On the front sides, there were two air exhaust [...] "slots" [...] {{on either side of}} the PD-4102, while the PD-4103 had five. In place of the <b>exhaust</b> fan <b>grilles</b> on the later model, the PD-4012 had a series of small holes punched into the sheet metal that made up the luggage rack soffit.|$|R
50|$|The Apal 1200 Saloon was an {{attractive}} car based on Volkswagen beetle floorplan. It had a thrust-forward nose with a divided front bumper and a well-sloped curved one-piece windshield. The rear-mounted engine was air-cooled, with cooling air <b>exhausting</b> through a <b>grille</b> in the rounded tail, which also sported a divided rear bumper.|$|R
5000|$|The CTS-V Coupe debuted at the 2010 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, {{and entered}} {{production}} in summer 2010 as a 2011 model. [...] It {{has the same}} [...] engine and transmission choices as the CTS-V sedan. The CTS-V Coupe features unique centered twin <b>exhausts,</b> a larger <b>grille</b> for air intake, and an optional [...] "saffron" [...] interior trim color. Like the CTS-V sedan, it comes standard with 19-inch aluminum wheels, Brembo brakes, and Magnetic Ride Control.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a three-dimensional analysis for thermal comfort in a library. The room model includes library layout, equipment and peripheral positions {{as well as}} the positions of inlet and outlet air for IAQ controls. Cold clean air is supplied to the room through ceiling-mounted air <b>grilles</b> and <b>exhausted</b> through air <b>grilles</b> situated on the same ceiling. A commercial CFD package was used in this study to achieve solutions of the distribution of airflow velocity and temperature. Using high quality meshes is vital to the overall accuracy of the results. Simulation results show a good agreement with experimental data from the literature. This study has thoroughly analysed the indoor thermal conditions and airflow characteristics of the building. In addition, verification of the CFD program with experimental data showed that the program can provide reasonable and reliable predictions on thermal comfort performance with the help of precise boundary conditions...|$|R
40|$|Under-Floor Air Distribution (UFAD) {{systems have}} {{potential}} advantages of energy saving and {{indoor air quality}} improvement over conventional well-mixed systems. As a ventilation strategy for buildings, a UFAD system provides conditioned air to occupied rooms through diffusers in raised floors and the air is <b>exhausted</b> through return <b>grilles</b> at the ceiling level. Many previous researches {{have focused on the}} energy saving and air quality improvement by UFAD systems because of their high supply air temperature and room air stratification. However, few of them paid attention to the effects of the heat transfer through floor slabs on the energy performance of buildings. The heat transfer across floor slabs increases the supply air temperature during the cooling mode and decreases it during the heating mode which may lead to energy loss. This thesis is to study the influence of the heat transfer through a floor slab between the under-floor plenum of a given occupied room and the downstairs return plenum on the energy performance of a typical office building. The impact of the non-uniform flow in the floor plenum was also analyzed since it affected the energy flow in the floor plenum. These factors were taken into account as well as the thermal stratification for a more rigorous and accurate energy assessment of UFAD systems. Year-round energy simulations of an office building with a UFAD system in Philadelphia were performed and compared to that with a well-mixed system. ...|$|R
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave <b>exhaust</b> tips and <b>grilles</b> and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|R
