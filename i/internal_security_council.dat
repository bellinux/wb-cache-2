The talks broke down as Marshall did not agree to the British Government's proposal for the casting vote on a proposed Defence Council to be held by the British High Commissioner to Singapore, who would only exercise it in an emergency. Marshall resigned as Chief Minister in June 1956, {{and was replaced by}} Lim Yew Hock. The following year, Lim led another delegation to the UK for further talks on self-government. This time, agreement was reached on the composition of an <b>Internal</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council.</b> Other constitutional arrangements were swiftly settled in 1958, and on 1 August the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the State of Singapore Act 1958, granting the colony full internal self-government. Under Singapore's new constitution which came into force on 3 June 1959, the Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State), who had power to appoint as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Legislative Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. The Constitution also created the post of the British High Commissioner, who was entitled to receive the agenda of each Cabinet meeting and to see all Cabinet papers. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party (PAP) swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. Nine other Ministers were appointed to the Cabinet.|$|E

While the meeting of Lim Chin Siong and Azahari reinforced the Singapore Special Branch's belief in an imminent communist subversion, The Earl of Selkirk still had his reservations about making the arrests. However, Sandys, the Colonial and Common Wealth Secretary pressured Selkirk to [...] "take advantage of the Barisan's declaration {{of support for the}} Indonesian-sponsored insurrection in Brunei. Selkirk was to push through the arrest under the cover of the Brunei emergency.‚Äù The arrests were approved by the British Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, on 12 December 1962 and the <b>Internal</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> promptly reconvened on 13 December to firm up details of the arrests.|$|E

5000|$|Operation Coldstore (...) , {{sometimes}} spelled Operation Cold Store, was {{the code}} {{name for a}} covert security operation carried out in Singapore on 2 February 1963 {{which led to the}} arrest of over 100 people, who were detained without trial under the Preservation of Public Service Security Ordinance (PSSO). In official accounts, the operation was a security operation [...] "aimed at crippling the Communist open front organisation," [...] which threatened Singapore's internal security. The operation was authorised by the <b>Internal</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> which was composed of representatives from the British, Singapore and Malayan Federal governments.|$|E
5000|$|Lim's {{meeting with}} Azahari on 6 December 1962 {{would change the}} British's minds. Azahari was a leading Brunei leftist who would {{eventually}} be accused of masterminding a rebellion in Brunei two days later. After that meeting, the British approved the swoop, and within a day the <b>Internal</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> approved a round of arrests. The operation was given the codename [...] "Coldstore". But the operation was delayed by almost two months as Lee and the Tunku negotiated over the list of people to be arrested. A list of 169 people was eventually finalised, with Lim's name {{at the top of}} the list.|$|E
5000|$|By 1962, it {{was clear}} that the Malayan {{government}} considered the arrests of Singapore's left-wing groups, which they perceived as communist breeding grounds, as one of the two pre-conditions for the creation of Malaysia. The debates over the specific of the arrests resulted in a power struggle in 1961 between the British, Singapore and Malayan leaders. In February 1962, the Malayans insisted on the apprehension of opposition leaders in Singapore and warned that they would pull out from the <b>Internal</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> if their requests were ignored. However, the British officials in Singapore opposed such oppressive measures and argued that evidence had to be presented before arrests could be made. Observing that the Malayans were pushing for an arrest programme, Lee Kuan Yew jumped onto the bandwagon in March 1962. The Malayans' call for arrests could revive Lee's earlier attempts in 1960 to remove [...] "certain communists close to Lim Chin Siong" [...] by invoking the PSSO.|$|E

Israel is the only liberal-democracy in the world where military intelligence is charged with assessing the intelligence map on a national, military, and state levels, and there have been repeated calls to transfer some of these roles from the Research Department to a civilian body, such as the National <b>Security</b> <b>Council,</b> {{as is the case in}} the United States.

[...] Among those arrested from the political sphere were 24 members from the Barisan Sosialis. The arrests were defended by invoking the PSSO with claims that the arrestees had [...] "the long-term aim of the Malayan Communist Party to infiltrate and take over left-wing political parties, workers' associations and trade unions in the colony in order to foment violent unrest.‚Äù A representative from the People's Action Party, S. Rajaratnam, justified the operation by stating that [...] "action was taken not because they are Communists but because the danger of subversion and violence by communist in aid of these alien interventions." [...] The <b>Internal</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Council</b> report stated that those arrested were [...] "hard core organisers and their collaborators of the Communist conspiracy in Singapore believed that the armed struggle remains a weapon to be employed whenever the opportunity arises." ...|$|E
