5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E
25|$|On August 30, 1940, Germany and Fascist Italy {{pressured}} Romania into {{signing the}} Second Vienna Award, which assigned Northern Transylvania to Hungary (which also brought the German military presence {{within hours of}} the oil fields in Prahova County).

500|$|When, {{several years}} after its passage, the 1873 law became a {{political}} issue, some {{of those involved in}} enacting it, including Sherman and Linderman, stated that there had been no intent to end bimetallism in the elimination of the authority for private citizens to have silver bullion coined into dollars. They argued that the 1853 legislation had ended the practice of having bullion struck into smaller-denomination coins; the 1873 act simply rectified an omission and eliminated a coin with a low mintage that did not circulate. They were not always consistent in their denials: Boutwell wrote in his memoirs that [...] "in 1873 <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> believe that it was wise for every nation to recognize, establish, and maintain the gold standard... hence it was that I determined to abandon the idea of a double [...] standard.|$|E

500|$|Lancashire's final role {{under her}} ITV {{contract}} was Gertrude Morel in {{an adaptation of}} D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal–her first of a mother with adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she {{had been unable to}} appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: [...] "whatever the reason I do what I do, I felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a point where I could stop searching after this". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire [...] "steals the show" [...] with a [...] "performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress." [...] Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that [...] "Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all", purely because she had [...] "long since proved herself a formidable actress".|$|E

"I capitulated {{to it at}} once, and a {{few years}} later was the author of a series of reports of the {{sessions}} of a mythical Bellamy club, in a Chicago illustrated paper, of which I myself was editor, articles which afford me amusing reading today, you may believe.

2500|$|Informed {{about his}} death, M.N. Roy wrote: [...] "I could {{not forget the}} {{injunction}} of the only man I ever obeyed almost blindly JatinDa's heroic death [...] must be avenged. Only a year had passed since then. But in the meantime <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> realise that I admired JatinDa because he personified, perhaps without himself knowing it, the best of mankind. The corollary to that realisation was that Jatinda's death would be avenged if I worked for the ideal of establishing a social order in which the best in man could be manifest." ...|$|E

2500|$|Williams married four times. She met {{her first}} husband Leonard Kovner while {{attending}} Los Angeles City College. She later wrote in her autobiography The Million Dollar Mermaid that [...] "he was smart, handsome, dependable...and dull. I respected his intelligence, and his dedication to a future career in medicine. He loved me, or so he said, and even asked me to marry him." [...] They were married in the San Francisco suburb of Los Altos on June 27, 1940. On their split she said [...] "I found, much to my relief, that all I needed for my emotional and personal security was my own resolve and determination. I didn't need a marriage and a ring. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> realize all too quickly that Leonard Kovner {{was not a man}} I could ever really love." [...] They divorced on September 12, 1944.|$|E
