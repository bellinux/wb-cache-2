5|$|An {{individual}} {{currency devaluation}} has to involve a corresponding {{rise in value}} {{for at least one}} other currency. The corresponding rise will generally be spread across all other currencies and so unless the devaluing country has a huge economy and is substantially devaluing, the offsetting rise for any individual currency will tend to be small or even negligible. In normal times other countries are often content to accept a small rise in the value of their own currency or at worst be indifferent to it. However, if much of the world is suffering from a recession, from low growth or are pursuing strategies which depend on a favourable balance of payments, then nations can begin competing with each other to devalue. In such conditions, once a small number of countries begin intervening this can trigger corresponding interventions from others as they strive to prevent further deterioration in their <b>export</b> <b>competitiveness.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain growth {{performance}} in Portugal in the last decades through a multi-equation system with cumulative growth characteristics. The model uses a demand-orientated approach to determine the main relationships which explain growth through a virtuous cycle. The idea is to identify the driving forces of growth with causal linkages and feedback tendencies that turn the process self-sustained. The multi-equation growth model is estimated by 3 SLS to capture more efficiently the interrelations between the main growth forces and to control for the endogeneity of the regressors. Our evidence shows that the proposed model can successfully be used to explain the Portuguese growth performance, highlighting the importance of <b>exports</b> <b>competitiveness</b> as the key factor in this process. The cumulative growth process can be interrupted at some points mainly due to the incapacity of transferring productivity gains into domestic prices and to turn the economy more competitive. Capital accumulation is also shown not to affect productivity growth and domestic prices not to improve <b>exports</b> <b>competitiveness.</b> These are the main drawbacks of the Portuguese economy that could explain the failure to achieve higher growth rates in the last decades.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to see the impacts of economic reforms and trade liberalisation policies on agricultural export performance of Pakistan. The major purpose is to examine the effects of both domestic supply-side factors and world demand on agricultural export performance. Four indicators of economic reforms and trade liberalisation policies are considered namely competitiveness, diversification, openness and world demand for agricultural products; these indicators capture the effects of both domestic supply-side policy reforms and world market potential. The effects are analysed in dynamic term both in the long-run and shortrun, using co integration and vector error correction (VECM) methods. The empirical results suggest that agricultural export performance is more sensitive to the domestic supply-side conditions, which change due to the policies, discussed. These findings support the importance of domestic policies designed to improve domestic supply conditions aimed at promoting agricultural exports. The empirical conclusions also indicate that there exists a unique long-run or equilibrium relationship among real value of agricultural <b>exports,</b> <b>competitiveness,</b> diversification, openness and world demand for agricultural products.

40|$|In general discussion, {{the concept}} of country's {{international}} competitiveness is frequently used for analysing its macroeconomic performance and is usually associated with price competitiveness, often measured by real effective exchange rate. In spite of its usefulness, this indicator has several drawbacks, stemming from its strong assumptions.

The {{results show that the}} appreciation of Czech real effective exchange rate, which occured between 1998 and 2008, was transfered into higher export prices in a very muted form and the improvements in quality of Czech exports were more than capable of compensating for this increase.

The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate the determinants of the Greek wine exports and to assess its competitiveness in the European market. Primary data regarding wine trade has been collected for the period of 2004 - 2011, referring to four main European producer countries, namely Greece, France, Germany and Bulgaria.

The results offer a clear picture of the wine trade dynamics in the EU market, indicating as key determinants for its competitiveness the size of each country's economy, the geographical distance from other EU countries, the presence of common borders or common language among trading nations as well as the size of per capita wine consumption to the European wine markets...|$|R
