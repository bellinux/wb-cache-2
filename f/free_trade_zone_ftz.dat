40|$|This article {{examines}} the consequences of changes in final and intermediate good tariffs on structural adjustment, urban unemployment, and the real exchange rate {{in the presence of}} a <b>free</b> <b>trade</b> <b>zone</b> (<b>FTZ)</b> and foreign capital in the host country. The location of the FTZ and the disaggregation of the economy allows us to examine the consequences of a tariff change on regional incomes. It is shown that as a consequence of a tariff change the urban and rural incomes need not necessarily move in the same direction (hence the potential for rural and urban conflict in policy making). It is also shown that an increase in the tariff on an immediate good may result in both export promotion and an increase in welfare. Such expansion is a nonconventional result, since raising barriers to trade normally leads to a contradiction in the volume of the trade. The interconnection between the real exchange rate and intermediate good tariff is also explored in this article. It is shown that a policy of imposing tariffs on these goods may result in the appreciation of the real exchange rate.

Our analysis shows that in the short run, if skilled labour is a substitute for the imported input and foreign capital in the FTZ, then production incentives to the FTZ through reduction in tariff rate on the imported input used by this zone (while maintaining the rate {{for the rest of the}} economy) reduce the level of outstanding debt. In the long run, however, the effect of giving additional incentives to the FTZ on the level of outstanding debt crucially depends upon one additional factor namely, the responsiveness of fiscal deficit to the level of outstanding debt.

40|$|This thesis aims to gain {{a deeper}} {{understanding}} of relationships and sexuality of women at risk of social exclusion in Sri Lanka and the risk of violations of their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) that they might face. Individual qualitative interviews with migrant women workers (n= 18) and men (n= 18) in the <b>Free</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Zone</b> (<b>FTZ),</b> women facing single motherhood (n= 28) and women formerly involved in prostitution (n= 15) were conducted. Conceptual approaches included gender, social navigation and SRHR. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis, qualitative content analysis and discourse analysis. Findings revealed that the migrant women workers negotiated norms of respectability in a society that highly stigmatizes FTZ women workers, while the men identified conflicting constructions of masculinity existing in the FTZ. The women facing single motherhood navigated oppressive and stigmatizing social forces, and the women in prostitution constructed themselves as respectable in opposition to their societal disvalue and marginalization. In order to retain an image of sexual innocence, unmarried women are likely to refrain from demanding or demonstrating SRHR knowledge and accessing services. Furthermore, gender power imbalances leave the women vulnerable to sexual persuasion, coercion and violence. Once pregnant, social, legal, and knowledge barriers hinder or delay them in accessing abortion services. Unmarried pregnant women are thus left with the alternatives of adoption, infanticide, and suicide or become stigmatized single mothers with risks of health and social exclusion for mother and child. Extreme marginalization and limited power make women in prostitution vulnerable to unsafe sex, rape and violence. In conclusion, these women are likely to face numerous and serious SRHR hazards. The complexity of gendered social circumstances and the SRHR implications demonstrated in this thesis, add to the SRHR knowledge in Sri Lanka, and should inform politicians and policy makers about the need to improve the situation of all women in Sri Lanka...|$|E
