40|$|Background The {{lack of an}} {{effective}} diagnostic tool for Carrion’s disease leads to misdiagnosis, wrong treatments and perpetuation of asymptomatic carriers living in endemic areas. Conventional PCR approaches have been reported as a diagnostic technique. However, the detection limit of these techniques is not clear as well as if its usefulness in low bacteriemia cases. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the detection limit of 3 PCR approaches. Methodology/Principal Findings We determined the detection limit of 3 different PCR approaches: Bartonella-specific 16 S rRNA, fla and its genes. We also evaluated the viability of <b>dry</b> <b>blood</b> spots to be used as a sample transport system. Our results show that 16 S rRNA PCR is the approach with a lowest detection limit, 5 CFU/μL, and thus, the best diagnostic PCR tool studied. <b>Dry</b> <b>blood</b> spots diminish the sensitivity of the assay.

40|$|Summary: The {{quantification}} of α-foetoprotein in <b>dry</b> <b>blood</b> spots from {{pregnant women}} was evaluated, using a conventional radioimmunoassay (RIA) with a monospecific antibody. The stability of α-foetoprotein in <b>dry</b> <b>blood</b> spots on filter paper was evaluated {{with respect to}} mailing, distances travelled, {{and the existence of}} high summer temperatures in our region. The results obtained show that the blood α-foetoprotein is stable on dry filter spots sent by mail and is stable for up to four weeks at 4, 25 and 37 °C. The analytical method used has a minimal detectable concentration of 10 + 1. 9 international kilo-units/I. Both inter- and intra-assay variabilities are smaller than 10 % and this method can provide results comparable with those of conventional serum assays. Results from <b>dry</b> <b>blood</b> spots and serum samples (the latter analysed by both RIA and two-site enzyme immunoassay) exhibited a good correlation (r = 0. 98 and r = 0. 97, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Summary: Immunometric assays were {{developed}} for thyrotropin arid thyroglobulin using time-resolved fluor-escence äs the measurement signal. The assays were suitable for measurements in serum/plasma or in <b>dry</b> <b>blood</b> spots (3 mm diameter). Both assays have acceptable coefficients of Variation for <b>dry</b> <b>blood</b> spots (intra-assay median CV < 10 %, inter-assay CV < 15 %) in the concentration ränge of interest (thyrotropin 3 — 250 mU/ 1, thyroglobulin 10 — 500 g/l). The relatively high CV values {{are not only}} due to the assay design {{but also to the}} inhomogeneity of the samples used. For serum samples the median intra-assay CV was < 3 % for thyrotropin in the ränge 0. 1 — 50 mU/ 1 and for thyroglo-bulin between 2 and 500 g/l. The corresponding inter-assay CV were less than 5 %.
