5|$|A {{victory over}} San Francisco gave the Browns 10 wins {{in a row}} to start the regular season. The game was eagerly {{anticipated}} by both sides: San Francisco had started the season with 10 victories, while the Browns had won their first nine games. The 49ers relied heavily on their offense, which featured quarterback Frankie Albert and end Alyn Beals. The team came into the matchup with the Browns averaging 35.9 points per game. The Browns, meanwhile, were more proficient than the 49ers on defense and in placekicking: the team ranked first in the AAFC in fewest points allowed, and Groza held the league record for the longest field goal. The game began with a San Francisco fumble of Cleveland's opening kickoff that was recovered by Lou Saban. Several plays later, Graham ran 14 yards for a touchdown, giving the Browns their first points. San Francisco responded later in the period with a rushing touchdown by Joe Perry to tie the score. Cleveland struck back with an Edgar Jones touchdown in the third quarter, however, and held {{on to win the}} game 14–7. Ara Parseghian was a standout on both offense and defense, batting down several of Albert's passes. The crowd of 82,769 set a professional football record. While Cleveland won, several key players suffered injuries. Speedie had a separated shoulder, while linebacker Bill Willis was kicked in the face and Tommy James hurt his ankle. Graham <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> stepped on, and guard Weldon Humble suffered a chin injury.|$|E
5|$|On 19 July, {{security}} forces {{carried out a}} controlled explosion on a bomb left at Ealing Broadway station and public transport was disrupted when the Metropolitan Police closed Victoria and Paddington train stations and halted services on the London Underground. On 21 September a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the MI6 headquarters using an RPG-22 rocket launcher, which generated headlines around the world. On 21 February 2001 a bomb disguised as a torch (flashlight) left outside a Territorial Army base in Shepherd's Bush seriously injured a 14-year-old cadet, who was blinded and <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> blown off. A second attack in Shepherd's Bush, the 4 March BBC bombing, injured a civilian outside the BBC Television Centre. The explosion was captured by a BBC cameraman, and the footage was broadcast on TV stations worldwide, and gained mass publicity for the group. On 14 April a bomb exploded at a postal sorting office in Hendon, causing minor damage but no injuries. Three weeks later on 6 May a second bomb exploded at the same building, causing slight injuries to a passer-by. The 3 August Ealing bombing injured seven people, and on 3 November a car bomb containing 60lb of home-made explosives was planted in the centre of Birmingham. The bomb did not fully detonate {{and no one was}} injured.|$|E

Despite the accident, construction officials still estimated the time of completion at January 1.|$|E
25|$|India's {{ambassador}} to Afghanistan, Jayant Prasad, stated that, {{after reviewing the}} scene, the main target of the attack {{was believed to be}} the Indian embassy building. He also added that, considering the huge amount of explosives used in the attack, it was clear that target was not top Indian diplomatic officials but the embassy itself. Bomb scene review further revealed that the embassy guard killed in the attack <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on the closed gates. The ambassador stated that {{it is likely that the}} guard did not open the gate because he saw a suspicious car driving behind an embassy vehicle. The suicide attacker then might have decided to explode his device near the gate rather than inside the embassy's compound. According to investigating officials, much of the impact was taken up by the sand filled blast barriers. These barriers, which were built across the embassy for added protection just one week before the blast, saved it from structural damage.|$|E

[...] El Glaoui collaborated intimately with the French authorities and used his formal power over Marrakesh to acquire vast properties {{in the city and}} region, accumulating a personal fortune reportedly greater than the sultan's own. [...] El Glaoui's notorious corruption - he received a cut from practically every business in Marrakesh, including prostitution and drug-trafficking - was tolerated and almost even encouraged by the residents-general, for so long as <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> in the till, El Glaoui had every incentive to maintain and prolong the state of affairs, making him a dependable client of the French authorities.|$|E
2500|$|After Big Cass was {{attacked}} backstage on the June 5 episode of Raw, Big Show would {{fill in for}} him as Enzo Amore's tag team partner to defeat Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. Big Show also appeared a week later, aiding Enzo after Big Cass was once again attacked backstage and forced to face Gallows and Anderson on his own. On the June 19 episode of Raw, Big Show seemingly quit the brand after Raw General Manager Kurt Angle {{asked if he was}} responsible for the sneak attack on Big Cass and Enzo during the past month of Raw, stating that [...] "he wouldn't attack people from behind, he'd rather attack them from the front". On the July 10 episode of Raw, Big Show returned and attacked Big Cass after he gloated over his attack on Enzo. Cass gained the advantage over Show in brawls in the two following weeks and again in a match when Enzo attacked Cass. On the August 7 episode of Raw, Big Show and Enzo lost to Gallows and Anderson. A week later, Big Show {{was attacked}} by The Club when confronting Cass. Big Show [...] later <b>had</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> squashed in the shark cage by the trio.
