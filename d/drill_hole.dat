30|$|An aqueous {{solution}} of phenolic resin was impregnated through <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> in wood, and we manufactured compressed wood with the deformation fixed by the phenolic resin. The methods of impregnation {{used in this}} study were an in-liquid platen-pressing method and a vacuum treatment. The effect of the <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> on solution retention was examined. Moreover, the control of solution retention was examined under the application of compression drying. The impregnation of resin into the specimens without <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> was insufficient, and the deformation could not be fixed. On the other hand, sufficient impregnation was possible in the specimen with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes,</b> and the deformation fixation was observed. At the stage of compression when the solution was squeezed out of the specimen, the solution retention of each specimen was accurately controlled in the specimens with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes.</b> At the stage of compressive deformation and deformation fixation using a hot press, the specimens without <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> could not be processed normally because swelling occurred. However, swelling did not occur in the specimens with <b>drilled</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|R
60|$|VIII. In Plate XII. fig. 1 I {{have given}} a most {{singular}} instance both of rude execution and defied symmetry, in the little pillar and spandril from a panel decoration under the pulpit of St. Mark's at Venice. The imperfection (not merely simplicity, but actual rudeness and ugliness) of the leaf ornament will strike the eye at once: this is general in works of the time, {{but it is not}} so common to find a capital which has been so carelessly cut; its imperfect volutes being pushed up one side far higher than on the other, and contracted on that side, an additional <b>drill</b> <b>hole</b> being put in to fill the space; besides this, the member a, of the mouldings, is a roll where it follows the arch, and a flat fillet at a; the one being slurred into the other at the angle b, and finally stopped short altogether at the other side by the most uncourteous and remorseless interference of the outer moulding: and in spite of all this, the grace, proportion, and feeling of the whole arrangement are so great, that, in its place, it leaves nothing to be desired; all the science and symmetry in the world could not beat it. In fig. 4 I have endeavored to give some idea of the execution of the subordinate portions of a much higher work, the pulpit of St. Andrea at Pistoja, by Nicolo Pisano. It is covered with figure sculptures, executed with great care and delicacy; but when the sculptor came to the simple arch mouldings, he did not choose to draw the eye to them by over precision of work or over sharpness of shadow. The section adopted, k, m, is peculiarly simple, and so slight and obtuse in its recessions as never to produce a sharp line; and it is worked with what at first appears slovenliness, but it is in fact sculptural sketching; exactly correspondent to a painter's light execution of a background: the lines appear and disappear again, are sometimes deep, sometimes shallow, sometimes quite broken off; and the recession of the cusp joins that of the external arch at n, in the most fearless defiance of all mathematical laws of curvilinear contact.|$|E

Delaying the crack initiation is important for the maintenance of machine elements {{as well as for the}} detection of crack initiation.

The experiment was carried out by using tensile test to obtain maximum applied load to the specimen while the finite element analysis was analyzed by using ALGOR V 22 software to obtain the stress of the specimen. The experimental results and the finite element analysis results show that the crack initiation life of the specimen was longer when the diameter of the stop <b>drilled</b> <b>holes</b> increased.
