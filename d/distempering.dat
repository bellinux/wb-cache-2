50|$|He was {{the eldest}} son of Dr. James Dixon, a {{distinguished}} Wesleyan preacher, by Mary, only daughter of the Rev. Richard Watson. In the biography he wrote of his father, Dixon describes his mother as 'an excellent Latin and Greek scholar, a perfect French and a sufficient Italian linguist, and an exquisite musician;' and of his grandmother, Mrs. Watson, who made a home with her daughter, he retained an affectionate recollection as of a very good and clever woman. Both the Watsons and Dixons belonged to the early school of Methodists, who did not renounce their membership in the church of England, {{so that there was}} no feeling that Dixon had been disloyal to their communion when he prepared for orders in the church. He was born on 5 May 1833 at Islington, and educated, under Dr. Gifford, at King Edward's School, Birmingham, where he had for school friends Edwin Hatch and Edward Burne-Jones. In June 1851, he matriculated at Pembroke College, Oxford, and when in the Christmas term of the same year Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris came up to Exeter College, they, with Fulford, Faulkner, Cormell Price, and a few more, formed a close brotherhood. An excellent account of these Oxford days was contributed by Dixon to Mr. J. W. Mackail's Life of Morris. He says ‘Jones and Morris were both meant for holy orders, and the same may be said {{of the rest of us}} except Faulkner; but the bond of alliance was poetry and indefinite artistic and literary aspirations. We all had the notion of doing great things for men according to our own will and bent.’ With Morris, Dixon projected the ‘Oxford and Cambridge Magazine,’ and had a hand, under Rossetti's direction, in the amateur <b>distempering</b> of the walls of Woodward's new debating hall at the Oxford Union with frescoes from the Arthurian Romances, now almost completely obliterated. Dixon did not in after life pursue painting as a study—a single canvas, a wedding-scene from Chaucer, is, it is believed, the only picture of his that survives —but he always retained his interest, and a visit to the old masters in the National Gallery was a regular incident of any visit to London. At Oxford Dixon read for the ordinary classical schools, and graduated B.A. in 1857. The next year he won the Arnold historical prize for an essay on ‘The Close of the Tenth Century of the Christian Era,’ and in 1863 Oxford's Sacred Poem Prize, the subject being ‘St. John in Patmos.’ The poem is in the heroic couplet, and is a very dignified and impressive piece of writing. His first published volume of poems, called ‘Christ's Company,’ had already appeared in 1861, and a second, ‘Historical Odes,’ followed in 1863. These early poems of Dixon were distinguished by not a little of the colour and imagination, and also by something of the eccentricity, that marked the early efforts of the Pre-Raphaelite school. The poems of the first volume, though largely upon religious subjects, are not strictly religious poetry; they are works of picturesque imagination rather than of devotional feeling. The ‘Historical Odes’ show an advance in simplicity, and a power, that Dixon afterwards carried further, of ode construction. The odes upon Wellington and Marlborough contain much good writing, and deserve more attention than they have received. After leaving Oxford, Dixon lodged for a time with Morris and Burne-Jones in Red Lion Square. In 1858, he was ordained to the curacy of St. Mary-the-Less, Lambeth, Mr. Gregory, the present dean of St. Paul's, giving him his title. In 1861, he moved to the curacy of St. Mary, Newington Butts.From 1863 to 1868 he was second master at Carlisle High School, and from 1868 to 1875 minor canon and honorary librarian of Carlisle Cathedral. After that he was for eight years vicar of Hayton, in Cumberland, and was then presented by the bishop of Carlisle to the vicarage of Warkworth in Northumberland, which he held till his death. Besides these small livings, Dixon received no preferment in the church, although the best years of his life were devoted to writing a church history, which took rank from the first moment of its appearance as a standard authority. His friends would have greatly valued for him the increase of leisure and opportunities for study which a cathedral stall would have afforded; but it was not to be. The distinctions which he received after the appearance of the first volume of his history, in 1877, were such as to reduce the already scanty leisure of a hardworked parish clergyman.|$|E

40|$|Within {{the scope}} of this thesis the {{development}} of the present knowledge about Canine <b>Distemper</b> throughout history is described. Different opinions of practitioners, scientists and amateurs during the single eras as well as the problems and errors while coping {{with one of the most}} dangerous diseases of dog are explained. One can trace early occurrence of Canine <b>Distemper</b> up to the age of Aristoteles. Since 1761 Canine <b>Distemper</b> spread through europe. At this time numerous presumptions exist regarding the etiology of the disease, and corresponding to this the methods of treatment were quite adventurous. In 1809 Jenner was probably one of the first who gave a more reliable description of Canine <b>Distemper.</b> Also the first attempts to develop a vaccination took place in this period. At the end of the 19 th century Canine <b>Distemper</b> was described as the probably most frequent disease of dog. Up to this time various bacteriological findings failed to proove associations with Canine <b>Distemper.</b> The diagnosis was set up exclusively by clinical symptoms which were described well at this time. However, the prognosis ever was formulated. The situation about 1900 was characterized by an intensive search for the infectious agent of Canine <b>Distemper,</b> for possibilities of therapy and prophylaxis. In 1905 Carre succeded to reproduce the disease in susceptable dogs with germ-free nasal mucus of infected dogs. By this experiment the virus etiology was prooved basically and confirmed finally in 1926 by Duncin and Landlow who established the ferret as an adequate test animal in the <b>Distemper</b> research. In the middle of the 20 th century the germ of Canine <b>Distemper</b> was recognized as a virus of the morbilli genus in the paramyxo virus family. In this period one succeeded also in adapting the virus to embryonated eggs and in cultivating it in culture tissues. These to milesteps met the requirements for developing a vaccine. Due to immunoprophylaxis and antibiotic treatment the classical clinical appearance of Canine <b>Distemper</b> changed. Modern methods of virology and molecular biology lead to new insights in the nature of this RNA virus. The disease transfer to man resp. ist contribution to other diseases was discussed, but could not be confirmed until now. All Canidae, Procyonidae and Mustelidae are considered to be susceptible. Despite vaccination Canine <b>Distemper</b> is next to Canine Parvovirosis still the most important viral disease of dog with worldwide importance attributable to ocasional epidemics. The dog is the main reservoir of the virus. There is a need for more investigations concerning the importance of wild species as virus reservoir. From the present status of knowledge a causal therapy of Cannine <b>Distemper</b> is impossible. Prophylaxis by vaccination is still the most important disease prevention. Conclusively, Canine <b>Distemper</b> still has to be considered as a disease with an uncertain prognosis...|$|R
40|$|Canine <b>distemper</b> {{virus is}} the {{etiological}} agent of a severe disease in dogs {{and many other}} carnivores. Clinical diagnosis of canine <b>distemper</b> is difficult due to the broad spectrum of signs that may be confounded with other respiratory and enteric diseases of dogs. Accordingly, a laboratory confirmation is required for suspected cases. In this study a real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for detection and quantitation of canine <b>distemper</b> virus. The assay exhibited high specificity as all the negative controls (no-template-controls and samples from healthy sero-negative dogs) and other canine pathogens were not misdetected. Up to 1 x 10 (2) copies of RNA were detected by the TaqMan assay, thus revealing a high sensitivity. Quantitative TaqMan was validated on clinical samples, including various tissues and organs collected from dogs naturally infected by canine <b>distemper</b> virus.

40|$|Abstract. The {{proliferation}} of footpad keratinocytes of canine <b>distemper</b> virus (CDV) –infected dogs was investigated. Footpads of 19 dogs inoculated experimentally with a virulent <b>distemper</b> strain (A 75 / 17) and of two noninoculated control dogs were collected at necropsy. Dogs {{were divided into}} four groups according to results of the postmortem examination: dogs with severe <b>distemper</b> (group 1), dogs with mild <b>distemper</b> (group 2), inoculated dogs without <b>distemper</b> (group 3) and noninoculated dogs (group 4). There was no distinct difference of epidermal thickness among the four groups. Infection of the footpad epidermis with CDV was demonstrated using immunohistochemistry for viral nucleoprotein and in situ hybridization for nucleoprotein messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). Only group 1 dogs had viral antigen and mRNA in the footpad epidermis with the same distribution. Footpad epidermis of group 1 dogs had more mitotic figures in the basal layer, and significantly more basal keratinocytes were positive for the proliferation markers Ki- 67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Double-staining for Ki- 67 and viral nucleoprotein identified rare double-labeled basal kerati-nocytes. These {{findings suggest that the}} presence of CDV particles in the footpad epidermis is associated with keratinocyte proliferation.

40|$|<b>Distemper</b> {{virus is}} very similar antigenically to measles virus, and the disease {{produced}} in ferrets by <b>distemper</b> is a systemic illness quite similar to measles infection in humans.

Transformation of circulating lymphocytes to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and pokeweed mitogen was suppressed on day 5, reached a nadir by days 8 to 11, and returned toward normal by days 23 to 30 after viral inoculation.
