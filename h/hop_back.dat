5|$|McCool was rested for {{the second}} tour match against Leicestershire, which Australia won by an innings. The next match against Yorkshireon a damp pitch {{favourable}} to slower bowlingwas the closest Australia came to defeat for the whole tour. McCool made three in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. After the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 5/20 in pursuit of 60 for victory when McCool arrived at the crease. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively only had four wickets in hand and faced the prospect of losing to an English county {{for the first time}} since 1912. McCool scored five before hitting a long <b>hop</b> <b>back</b> to left-arm spinner Johnny Wardle to leave Australia at 6/31. However, Australia lost no further batsmen and scraped home by four wickets. McCool’s leg spin was used as Keith Miller and Bill Johnston bowled almost unchanged for the entire match.|$|E

So I tried to return to that age when you're so strong and self-confident, while acknowledging there's also a part of being a teenager when you're sometimes very insecure and feel very fragile." ...|$|E

60|$|Concealing {{the bird}} by holding {{it against her}} breast with a hand supersensitive to its warm little feathers, she walked till she found a deserted {{tenement}} doorway.

60|$|So {{it was a}} {{premature}} sentiment {{on the part of}} Miss Theo--that little tender flutter of the bosom which we have acknowledged she felt on first beholding the Virginian, so handsome, pale, and bleeding. This was not the great passion which she knew her heart could feel. Like the birds, it had wakened and begun to sing at a false dawn. <b>Hop</b> <b>back</b> to thy perch, and cover thy head with thy wing, thou tremulous little fluttering creature! It is not yet light, and roosting is as yet better than singing. Anon will come morning, and the whole sky will redden, and you shall soar up into it and salute the sun with your music.|$|E
60|$|One huge wave catches {{me up and}} chucks me in {{a sitting}} posture, as hard as ever it can, down on to a rock which has been put there for me. And, before I’ve said “Oh! Ugh!” and found out what has gone, the wave comes back and carries me out to mid-ocean. I begin to strike out frantically for the shore, and wonder if I shall ever see home and friends again, and wish I’d been kinder to my little sister when a boy (when I was a boy, I mean). Just when I have given up all hope, a wave retires and leaves me {{sprawling}} like a star-fish on the sand, and I get up and look back and find that I’ve been swimming for my life in two feet of water. I <b>hop</b> <b>back</b> and dress, and crawl home, where I have to pretend I liked it.|$|E
60|$|I cannot {{tell whether}} I were more pleased or mortified to observe, in those solitary walks, that the smaller birds {{did not appear}} to be at all afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard’s distance, looking for worms and other food, with as much {{indifference}} and security as if no creature at all were near them. I remember, a thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand, with his bill, a of cake that Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast. When I attempted to catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavouring to peck my fingers, which I durst not venture within their reach; and then they would <b>hop</b> <b>back</b> unconcerned, to hunt for worms or snails, as they did before. But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my strength so luckily, at a linnet, that I knocked him down, and seizing him by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse. However, the bird, who had only been stunned, recovering himself gave me so many boxes with his wings, on both sides of my head and body, though I held him at arm’s-length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I was twenty times thinking to let him go. But I was soon relieved by one of our servants, who wrung off the bird’s neck, and I had him next day for dinner, by the queen’s command. This linnet, as near as I can remember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an English swan.|$|E

5000|$|A light jig is the second-fastest {{of all the}} jigs. The performer's feet rarely {{leave the}} ground for long, as the step is fast, {{typically}} performed at a speed around 116 at feiseanna. There are several light jig steps, varying with each dance school, but one step is almost standard in all light jigs. This step {{is known as the}} rising step, or the rise and grind. This is the right side version of it: Put your weight on your left foot and lift your right foot off the ground. Hop on your left foot once. Hop on your left foot again, bringing your right foot back behind your left foot and then shift your weight onto your right foot, leaving your left foot in the air. Dancers use the phrase [...] "hop, hop back" [...] for these three movements, and there is a slight pause between the hop, and <b>hop</b> <b>back.</b> The next movement is a hop on your right foot. Then you shift your weight on your feet, left-right-left-right. The phrase for this whole movement is: [...] "hop, <b>hop</b> <b>back,</b> <b>hop</b> <b>back</b> 2-3-4." [...] To do the step on the left foot, reverse the left and right directions.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{undesirable}} high-frequency free-layer switching in magnetic multilayer systems, {{referred to as}} <b>back</b> <b>hopping,</b> is investigated {{by means of the}} spin-diffusion model. A possible origin of the back-hopping effect is found to be the destabilization of the pinned layer which leads to perpetual switching of both layers. The influence of different material parameters on the critical switching currents for the free and pinned layer is obtained by micromagnetic simulations. It is found that the choice of a free-layer material with low polarization β and saturation magnetization M_s, and a pinned-layer material with high β and M_s leads to a low free-layer critical current and a high pinned-layer critical current and hence reduces the likelihood of <b>back</b> <b>hopping.</b> While <b>back</b> <b>hopping</b> was observed in various types of devices, there are only few experiments that exhibit this effect in perpendicularly magnetized systems. However, our simulations suggest, that this is likely to change due to loss of pinned-layer anisotropy when decreasing device sizes...|$|R
