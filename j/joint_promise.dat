60|$|Lady Lufton had not {{sent for}} Dr. Robarts {{all the way}} from Exeter for nothing. The living of Framley was in the gift of the Lufton family, and the next {{presentation}} would be in Lady Lufton's hands, if it should fall vacant before the young lord was twenty-five years of ago, and in the young lord's hands if it should fall afterwards. But the mother and the heir consented to give a <b>joint</b> <b>promise</b> to Dr. Robarts. Now, as the present incumbent was over seventy, and as the living was worth £900 a year, there could be no doubt as to the eligibility of the clerical profession. And I must further say, that the dowager and the doctor were justified in their choice by the life and principles of the young man--as far as any father can be justified in choosing such a profession for his son, and as far as any lay impropriator can be justified in making such a promise. Had Lady Lufton had a second son, that second son would probably have had the living, and no one would have thought it wrong;--certainly not if that second son had been such a one as Mark Robarts.|$|E
40|$|I {{propose a}} general {{promissory}} account of agreements {{according to which}} an agreement is an instance of joint intentional action, something the parties do together as a group. What agreement parties do together as a group is promise. Specifically, each party promises the other to do her part of the agreement, neither more nor less. Two promises count as a <b>joint</b> <b>promise</b> just when they {{can be said to}} interdepend in an explanatorily important way. The interdependence of agreement-promises is primarily a matter of the causal-motivational role each party’s belief about the relation between her own promise and that of the other plays in the giving of her own promise. When you and I open our umbrellas as it starts raining, we open our umbrellas together; when we dance the tango, we tango together as a group. One of the things you and I can do together, as a group, is enter into an agreement. Presumably, we can also carry out the agreement together as a group. However, to explain agreements is to explain the entering into agreements. My general hypothesis is that, whenever you and I enter into an agreement, we do something together, as a group, in the same intuitive sense we do something together, as a group, whenever we tango...|$|E
40|$|Mobility {{will be a}} key {{aspect of}} future {{planetary}} surface missions. A rover with several segments connected by rotary <b>joints</b> <b>promises</b> much capability in terrain traversal, but is not well understood. In this thesis, a computer model was built to simulate the movements of a passively articulated, segmented-body rover. Its main components are a linearized soil-wheel interaction model, a Newton-Euler based dynamic model, and a PD control module to regulate steering and handle disturbances. The simulation outputs were compared against results from past research on fixed-chassis vehicles. Next, the simulation was used to investigate the driving and turning behavior of articulated vehicles, and their controllability using a simple control system. It {{was found that the}} vehicle is relatively stable, and that simple control is possible...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{variable}} stiffness actuation (VSA) for robotic <b>joints</b> <b>promises</b> advantages regarding robustness, energy efficiency, and task adaptability. The VS joints developed at DLR show very low intrinsic damping for efficient energy storage and retrieval whereas the desired damping behavior for task execution {{needs to be}} implemented in control. Robotic arms with multiple VS joints, as for example the DLR Hand Arm System, ask for advanced control algorithms which can cope with the elastic joints and the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system properties of the mechanical setup. We propose a MIMO controller for flexible joint robots based upon an eigenmode decoupling approach. For robustness reasons, the controller is designed to modify the intrinsic plant properties {{as little as possible}} while attaining the desired damping. A gain design algorithm is proposed. The controller is validated in simulations and experiments...|$|R
50|$|Joint Operations: Typhoon Rising is a 2004 first-person shooter {{computer}} game from Novalogic that focuses {{almost entirely on}} its expansive online multiplayer mode. Set in Indonesia in the near future, Joint Operations takes the player to a country {{on the verge of}} disintegration. Regional independence movements have acquired advanced weaponry as the nation's military splits into competing factions. Escalating violence threatens innocent civilians and Western economic interests. Developed using the Black Hawk Down engine, <b>Joint</b> Operations <b>promises</b> superior rendering technology and an enhanced 3rd generation multiplayer experience.|$|R
60|$|He {{spoke and}} looked {{so much in}} earnest, that Anne was not {{surprised}} to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself. Her countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise of the fine mind {{did not appear to}} excite a thought in her sister. The lady could not but yield to such <b>joint</b> entreaties, and <b>promise</b> to stay.|$|R
2500|$|Despite U.S.-Russia {{relations}} becoming strained {{during the}} Bush administration, Russian president Dmitry Medvedev (president from May 2008 until May 2012, with Vladimir Putin {{as head of}} government) and U.S. president Barack Obama struck a warm tone at the 2009 G20 summit in London and released a <b>joint</b> statement that <b>promised</b> a [...] "fresh start" [...] in Russia-United States relations. The statement also called on Iran to abandon its nuclear program and to permit foreign inspectors into the country.|$|R
30|$|The second {{scenario}} considered {{involves an}} S-band satellite network for mobile applications. In fact, such networks are typically bandwidth limited and {{the usage of}} <b>joint</b> multibeam processing <b>promises</b> to increase overall system capacity by exploiting the full frequency reuse while mitigating the challenging interbeam interference limitation requirements within the overall system concept. More aggressive reuse of the available spectrum reuse is consequently possible through smaller beams with no requirements on co-channel isolation leading to potentially increased overall system capacity. The RL is analyzed in this context hereafter.|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{represents an}} historic national Agreement between Government, employers and school workforce unions to help schools, teachers {{and support staff}} meet the challenges that lie ahead. It <b>promises</b> <b>joint</b> action, designed to help every school {{across the country to}} raise standards and tackle workload issues. Action will take place across England and Wales and will take account of the different circumstances from school to school. Proposals in this Agreement for changes to the School Teachers’ Pay and Conditions Document will apply equally to teachers in England and Wales. " - introduction...|$|R
5000|$|Following the election, IdV formed its own {{groups in}} the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, instead of joining the Democrats in a <b>joint</b> group as <b>promised,</b> and started a {{competition}} with its main ally. In October 2008 Veltroni, who distanced from Di Pietro many times, declared that [...] "on some issues he Pietro is distant from the democratic language of the centre-left", however the PD decided to support Carlo Costantini (IdV) in the 2008 regional election in Abruzzo. Costantini was defeated, but in the event IdV came close to the PD (15.0% versus 19.6%).|$|R
40|$|Bringing {{mechanically}} compliant joints to robots is in {{the focus}} of interest world wide, especially in the humanoid robotics community. Variable Stiffness <b>Joints</b> (VSJ) <b>promise</b> to gain a high performing and robust robotic system. The presented DLR Floating Spring Joint (FSJ) is a VSJ module designed for the first 4 axes of the anthropomorphic DLR Hand Arm System. The DLR Hand Arm System aims to match the skills of its natural archetype. For this purpose, the joints have to be extremely compact {{to fit into the}} arm. At the same time they require a high power density in order to approximate the human arm skills. The new DLR FSJ is designed completely from an energy based point of view. This addresses not only energy efficient components and low friction design, but also that the potential energy of the spring is used as good as possible. A demonstration of robustness is given by the investigation of a blunt impact to the tip of the arm...|$|R
50|$|Zhou Nan was {{promoted}} {{to the office of}} Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1984. His primary task was to spearhead the Chinese delegation to negotiate the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong with the British Foreign Ministry. Replacing his former superior Yao Guang, whose lack of progress the PRC government had become disenchanted with, Zhou remained in constant talks with the British delegation for 13 years until the official handover of Hong Kong in 1997. On September 26, 1984, Zhou Nan and British delegation head Sir Richard Evans initialed the important Sino-British Joint Declaration (中英联合声明) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. It was later formally signed by the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and the Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang again in the Great Hall of the People on 19 December 1984. The <b>Joint</b> Declaration <b>promised</b> Hong Kong's status as a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China after 1997, and allowed Hong Kong citizens to retain their rights and freedoms enjoyed under British rule.|$|R
40|$|Molecular or {{biochemical}} biomarkers of <b>joint</b> metabolism offer <b>promise</b> {{in helping}} us understand joint pathology, its detection and treatment. But they {{have often been}} studied alone and in only one body fluid. Although the synovial joint is usually the focus of most arthritis pathology, it is often difficult, {{for a variety of}} reasons, to obtain synovial fluid that should best reflect changes in biomarkers related to pathology. It is therefore very important to see whether analyses of more readily obtainable sera and urine also reflect changes in synovial fluid. Catterall and colleagues, in a paper in Arthritis Research & Therapy that examines very early biomarker changes following joint injury, provide us with some insights into these important questions. As the study was very small and examined very early changes following joint injury, prior to onset of any recognisable pathology, we look forward to future larger biomarker studies of this kind in patients with clinically defined arthritic changes to which we can relate biomarker data...|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the main}} {{concerns}} centred around the noise levels expected from the new trains, which environmentalists said would be [...] "equivalent to a continuous stream of jets taking off", and would be heard five kilometres away. This is likely an exaggeration (see Examples of sound pressure), although the 1989 progress report indicated that NSW planning limitations for peak noise of 80dBA would only be met {{at a distance of}} 150m from the line. The Joint Venture's solution to this was to plan for the line to pass no closer than 200m to existing dwellings without noise abatement measures. Some raised concerns that this would severely restrict future development along the noise corridor. Public opposition also led the <b>Joint</b> Venture to <b>promise</b> that the VFT would be restricted to 80 km/h {{on the part of the}} alignment passing through the Wolli Creek Valley residential area; if additional speed restrictions were demanded in other residential areas, travel times would begin to be severely affected, damaging the project's profitability.|$|R
40|$|In this work, an all-bonded out-of-autoclave (OoA) curved {{longitudinal}} composite joint concept, {{intended for}} use in the next generation of composite heavy lift launch vehicles, was evaluated and verified through finite element (FE) analysis, fabrication, testing, and post-test inspection. The joint was used to connect two curved, segmented, honeycomb sandwich panels representative of a Space Launch System (SLS) fairing design. The overall size of the resultant panel was 1. 37 m by 0. 74 m (54 in by 29 in), of which the joint comprised a 10. 2 cm (4 in) wide longitudinal strip at the center. NASTRAN and ABAQUS were used to perform linear and non-linear analyses of the buckling and strength performance of the jointed panel. Geometric non-uniformities (i. e., surface contour imperfections) were measured and incorporated into the FE model and analysis. In addition, a sensitivity study of the specimens end condition showed that bonding face-sheet doublers to the panel's end, coupled with some stress relief features at corner-edges, can significantly reduce the stress concentrations near the load application points. Ultimately, the jointed panel was subjected to a compressive load. Load application was interrupted at the onset of buckling (at 356 kN 80 kips). A post-test non-destructive evaluation (NDE) showed that, as designed, buckling occurred without introducing any damage into the panel or the joint. The jointed panel was further capable of tolerating an impact damage to the same buckling load with no evidence of damage propagation. The OoA cured all-composite <b>joint</b> shows <b>promise</b> as a low mass factory joint for segmented barrels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Aluminum alloys {{are used}} in many {{applications}} in which the combination of high strength and low weight is attractive; ship building, air frame, transportation industry etc. are some areas in which the low weight can be significant value. Friction stir welding (FSW) is a new welding technique particularly well suited to aluminum alloys though this technique is also used for other materials. Friction stir welding <b>promises</b> <b>joints</b> with low porosity, fine microstructures, minimum phase transformation and low oxidation compared to conventional welding techniques. It is capable of joining combinations of alloys not amenable to conventional welding. Experiments for tensile and deflection tests were carried out and reported in this research paper. The base material used for friction stir welding was AA 6351 –T 4 Aluminum alloy. Tensile strength and breaking loads were increased with increase of rotational speed of the tool but it drops after attaining marginal speed. Deflections of friction stir welded specimens and base materials were compared and they exhibited almost similar trends at different load conditions and deflections of all the specimens were increased with increment of load...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{materials}} are comprised {{of a small}} number of types of discrete physical building blocks, which assemble to form constructions that meet the versatility and scalability of digital computation and communication systems. This work seeks to demonstrate the applicability of a digital material approach in designing new cellular materials and methods for assembly of structures with static reconfigurability. The science of cellular solids has enabled the widespread use of lightweight materials to meet important engineering needs, such as passive energy absorption, but they are not in widespread use for structural applications, perhaps due to a large gap between the strength and stiffness to weight ratios of popular classical solids, and the performance of known lightweight cellular materials that are produced from the same constituent material. The engineering of fiber reinforced composite materials has enabled structures with large reductions in weight for given strength and stiffness targets, but at very high design and processing costs, and many challenges producing mechanical interfaces (<b>joints).</b> Digital materials <b>promise</b> scalable methods of producing functional things with reconfigurable sets of discrete and compatible parts, but the presence of many reversible connections raises questions about the performance of the end result. Digital Cellular Solids are cellular solids that exhibit improvements in relative stiffness and strength compared to relative density, over current practices for producing lightweight materials. This is accomplished by assembling lattice geometries that perform better than any that we know how to make with traditional methods. When implemented with fiber composites, the result is not only stiffer and stronger than any previously known ultra-light material, but it presents a new scalable and flexible workflow for applying fiber composites to engineering problems. by Kenneth C.
