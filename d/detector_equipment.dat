40|$|The LHCb hostcard USB {{interface}} (HUSBi) card is a High Speed USB 2. 0 {{communication card}} used for data interchange and control in high voltage distribution systems for particle detectors at CERN, {{and particularly in}} the LHCb experiment.

The HUSBi card is used to link the controllers with host PCs, permitting individual control of all the channels used to supply the detector. The project includes the development of a Linux kernel device driver for the HUSBi communication card. This driver includes a security level that protects the hardware from manipulation that could damage the expensive <b>detector</b> <b>equipment</b> if the high voltage is incorrectly applied.

The signal of each PMT is digitized by an electronic channel. The Monitoring and Calibration Web System (MCWS) supports the data quality analysis of the electronic channels. This application was developed to assess the detector status and verify its performance. It can provide to the user the list of TileCal known problematic channels, that is stored in the ATLAS condition database (COOL DB). The bad channels list guides the data quality validator in identifying new problematic channels and is used in data reconstruction and the system allows to update the channels list directly in the COOL database.

These techniques are fairly complex and expensive. Therefore, for analysis of arsenic speciation in our studies on thermophilic iron and arsenic oxidation, we developed a simple (and inexpensive) method based on anionic ion exclusion chromatography using sulfuric acid as mobile phase, followed by UV detection. The detection limit was 0. 1 ¿mg¿L- 1 of arsenite (As 3 +) and 0. 1 ¿mg¿L- 1 of arsenate (As 5 +).

40|$|International audienceTwo-time-step laser-induced {{incandescence}} (LII) imaging {{was performed}} in Diesel engine-relevant combustion to investigate its applicability for spatially-resolved measurements of soot primary particle sizes. The method is based on evaluating gated LII signals acquired with two cameras consecutively after the laser pulse and using LII modeling to deduce the particle size from the ratio of local signals. Based on a theoretical analysis, optimized detection times and durations were chosen to minimize measurement uncertainties. Experiments were conducted in a high-temperature high-pressure constant-volume pre-combustion vessel under the Engine Combustion Network's (ECN) "Spray A" conditions at 61 – 68 bar with additional parametric variations of injection pressure, gas temperature, and composition. The LII measurements were supported by pyrometric imaging measurements of particle heat-up temperatures. The results were compared to particle-size and size-dispersion measurements from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of soot thermophoretically sampled at multiple axial distances from the injector. The discrepancies between the two measurement techniques are discussed to analyze uncertainties and related error sources of the two diagnostics. It is found that in such environment where particles are small and pressure is high, LII signal decay times are such that LII with standard nanosecond laser and <b>detector</b> <b>equipment</b> suffers from a strong bias towards large particles...|$|E

The {{running of the}} Large Hadron Collider will expose the ATLAS detector to radiation. Therefore, CERN must follow specific regulations from both the French and Swiss authorities for equipment removal, transport, repair, and disposal. GLANCE Traceability, implemented in C++ and Java/Java 3 D, has been developed to fulfill the requirements. The system registers and associates each equipment part to either a functional position in the detector or a zone outside the underground area through a 3 D graphical user interface. Radiation control of the equipment is performed using a radiation monitor connected to the system: the local background gets stored and the threshold is automatically calculated. The system classifies the equipment as non radioactive if its radiation dose does not exceed that limit value. History for both location traceability and radiation measurements is ensured, as well as simultaneous management of multiples equipment.

Through the system, it is also possible to update the channels list directly in the COOL database.
