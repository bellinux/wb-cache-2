50|$|The News America FSI {{was formed}} when News Corporation {{purchased}} the marketing divisions of two Free Standing <b>Insert</b> (<b>FSI)</b> business competitors: Quad/Marketing Inc. and Product Movers Inc., in 1988. In 1997, News America purchased Actmedia, an In-Store marketing and promotions company that operated out of Connecticut, {{and the company}} {{changed its name to}} News America Marketing.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the free {{standing}} insert has been intensely used since {{it seems to be}} an alternative media in communicating firms’sales promotion to customers. It is preferred by the manufacturers and by the intermediate firms because communication of this media to consumers is relatively easier and cheaper compared to other advertising tools. In this study, the concepts of "sales promotion, price discount and free standing in- sert" are described and a research is conducted to determine the decision of hyper/su- permarket customers about the free standing insert.

Worth, TX markets via the use of SUR (Seemingly Unrelated Regression) technique. As well, impacts of featuring, display, and <b>free-standing</b> <b>inserts</b> on movement of spaghetti sauces at the store level were obtained. Dynamics in item movement also were captured. Within a particular market for a given brand, coefficients of factors affecting movement of spaghetti sauce were different across stores. Agribusiness,...|$|R

50|$|The Milwaukee Sentinel, {{begun in}} 1837 as a weekly {{published}} by city co-founder Solomon Juneau, {{passed through the}} hands of several owners before being sold to the Hearst Corporation in 1924. Hearst operated the Sentinel until 1962, when, following a long and costly strike, it abruptly announced {{the closing of the}} paper. Although Hearst claimed that the paper had lost money for years, The Journal Company, concerned about the loss of an important voice (and facing questions about its own dominance of the Milwaukee media market), agreed to buy the Sentinel name, subscription lists, and goodwill associated with the name. In 1995 the Journal and Sentinel were consolidated. The new Journal Sentinel then became a seven-day morning paper. In 1964, Journal Communications bought a part interest in Perry Printing, a commercial printer specializing in printing magazines, catalogs and <b>free-standing</b> <b>inserts</b> for publications. A decade later, in 1974, it purchased the remaining shares of the company. In 1995, it sold the operation (which by then had about 1000 employees and sales of $123 million) to the Milhous Group of California. In 1968, the Midwestern Relay cable transmission division of the Journal Company was developed out of broadcast-related expertise; in 1991, Midwestern Relay acquired Norlight, a fiber-optic private carrier, and adopted the Norlight name. On February 26, 2007 Journal Communications sold the regional telecommunications provider to privately held Q-Comm Corp of Delaware. Upon closing the transaction, Q-Comm terminated Jim Ditter, who had been president of Norlight since 1995, and chief financial officer Mike Garvey. What is now known as the Journal Community Publishing Group began in Waupaca, Wisconsin in 1972 as a publishing and printing company called Add Inc. A majority interest was purchased by Journal Communications in 1981, and the remainder in 1986. In June 2007, Journal Communications sold off its JCP interests in Louisiana, Ohio, Connecticut and Vermont. The sales brought in a combined $30 million.|$|R
5000|$|Cooking in an 1823 {{house would}} have {{involved}} using {{the fireplace and}} in the case of the Schencks a 10 plate stove and pipe. A [...] "5 plate stove" [...] or German Jamb stove was a cast-iron free-standing stove developed in German speaking regions in the 1550s A.D.. However, it was used for heating the sleeping and sitting areas of the first floor of the house. The kitchen was heated by the kitchen fireplace. Once in America German immigrants developed a 6 plate Six Plate stove (history) or closed stove which was cooked on by the 1740s. Benjamin Franklin is also an inventor of a coal burning stove in 1741, Franklin stove. However, it was not <b>free-standing</b> and was <b>inserted</b> into the fireplace.|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} approach {{to improving the}} performance of the Li-S battery is presented, based on applying high energy ball milling to create a porous sulfur-carbon composite, insertion of a free-standing layer, and adoption of a new charging method. Surface area analysis and field emission scanning electron microscope imaging show that the ball-milled sulfur powder has a porous structure and very high specific surface area. A vacuum-filtrated single-walled carbon nanotube <b>free-standing</b> layer is <b>inserted</b> in between the sulfur cathode and the separator. It is believed that high-surface-area porous sulfur will help to increase the conductivity of the elemental sulfur due to better adhesion between the conducting carbon and the sulfur, while the free-standing layer will sequester longer chain polysulfides, which are responsible for the well-known shuttling phenomenon. By the combination of these methods, we have achieved excellent capacity and cycle life. Finally, a new charging method which will largely prevent the formation of longer chain polysulfides is also applied to increase the capacity retention. It is believed that with the combination of ball milling, the free-standing layer, and the new charging method, it is possible to commercialize the Li-S battery with better capacity and cycle life...|$|R
40|$|Inteins are genetic elements, {{inserted}} in-frame into protein-coding genes, whose products catalyze their {{removal from}} the protein precursor via a protein-splicing reaction. Intein domains can be {{split into two}} fragments and still ligate their flanks by a trans-protein-splicing reaction. A bioinformatic analysis of environmental metagenomic data revealed 26 different loci with a novel genomic arrangement. In each locus, a conserved enzyme coding region is broken in two by a split intein, with a <b>free-standing</b> endonuclease gene <b>inserted</b> in between. Eight types of DNA synthesis and repair enzymes have this ‘fractured’ organization. The new types of naturally split-inteins were analyzed in comparison to known split-inteins. Some loci include apparent gene control elements brought in with the endonuclease gene. A newly predicted homing endonuclease family, related to very-short patch repair (Vsr) endonucleases, was found in half of the loci. These putative homing endonucleases also appear in group-I introns, and as stand-alone inserts {{in the absence of}} surrounding intervening sequences. The new fractured genes organization appears to be present mainly in phage, shows how endonucleases can integrate into inteins, and may represent a missing link in the evolution of gene breaking in general, and in the creation of split-inteins in particular...|$|R
40|$|Lithium sulfide (Li 2 S), {{which has}} a {{theoretical}} capacity of 1166 mA h/g, is considered as a promising cathode material for the Li-S battery. The electrochemical performance of microsized Li 2 S is impaired, however, by its low electrical conductivity as well as first cycle high activation potential problem. In this work, microsized Li 2 S powder had been ball-milled with different carbon sources to synthesize Li 2 S-C composites {{as well as to}} find the suitable carbon sources, which were then capillary-deposited in three-dimensional multi-layered Ni foam from a dioxolane-containing mixture to fabricate a binder-free Li 2 S-C composite cathode. A large amount of active material (∼ 5 mg/cm 2) was loaded in each cathode with the help of conventional capillary deposition method. Scanning electron micrographs show that the Li 2 S-C composite successfully fills the pores in the Ni foam through capillary action and maintains the integrity of the structure before and after cycling performance. Electrochemical performance testing shows that the capillary-deposited binder-free Li 2 S-C composite showed excellent cycling performance along with superior rate capability. For further improvement of electrochemical performance, a single-walled carbon nanotube <b>free-standing</b> layer was <b>inserted</b> in between the cathode and the separator which minimized polysulfides shuttle phenomenon thus improved the discharge capacity and the capacity retention...|$|R
