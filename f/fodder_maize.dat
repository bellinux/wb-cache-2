Blood urea concentrations in the buffaloes were measured and related to the feeding management. Six different concentrate mixtures commonly prepared on the farms were identified.

This together with feeding of the concentrate at a flat rate without considering milk yield resulted in overfeeding of protein to low producers {{and at the same time}} caused inadequate nutrition of high producing buffaloes. Buffaloes producing 4 to 6 liters of milk/day received 200 to 1400 g crude protein above requirements, while those yielding 10 - 12 liters of milk suffered from deficiency of both protein and energy. Plasma urea levels varied due to farms (P< 0. 05) and fodder seasons (P< 0. 05) and varied from 36. 15 to 39. 09 mg/ 100 ml during berseem and from 21. 74 to 28. 01 mg/ 100 ml during <b>maize</b> <b>fodder</b> season.

The WP values for the main crops were computed using the SWAP simulated water balance components, i. e. transpiration T, evapotranspiration ET, irrigation 1, and the marketable yield Y-M in terms in terms of YMT- 1, YMET- 1 and YMI- 1. The average WP, expressed as $ T- 1 (US $ m(- 3)) was 0. 19 for wheat, 0. 5 for <b>fodder</b> <b>maize,</b> 0. 06 for sunflower and 0. 38 for sugar beet. This indicated that <b>fodder</b> <b>maize</b> provides the highest economic benefit in the Borkhar irrigation district.

II) calves and fed concentrate mixture and <b>maize</b> <b>fodder.</b> The concentrate mixture was consumed by all the animals. DM intake (kg/d) through green <b>maize</b> <b>fodder</b> was 4. 99 + 0. 11 and 5. 1 + 0. 13 in female and male animals. Average total DMI per 100 kg body weight was 1. 90 + 0. 10 and 2. 23 + 0. 06 kg which was higher in case of male animals. DMD was 59. 93 + 1. 92 and 57. 7 + 2. 50 {{in the two groups}}, hence total digestible nutrients intake was 3. 04 + 30. 09 and 2. 99 + 0. 14 kg/day in the two groups which corresponds to 9. 93 + 0. 30 and 9. 77 + 0. 47 M Cal of metabolisable energy consumption by the animals. Total methane produced (g/d) was 79. 99 + 6. 75 and 93. 22 + 4. 58 in the two groups, when expressed on the basis of per kg body weight of the animal the values were 306. 00 + 34. 25 and 409. 00 + 35. 14 mg. One kg dry matter intake resulted in 15. 9 + 1. 26 g of methane in female calves and 18. 34 + 1. 31 g in male calves while one kg of digestible dry matter intake produced 26. 70 + 2. 03 and 32. 17 + 3. 22 g by the two groups.

40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the metabolizable protein (MP) content of common indigenous feedstuffs used in ruminant nutrition using in situ method. Materials and Methods: Nine ruminant feeds such as maize grain (MG), groundnut cake (GNC), mustard oilcake (MOC), cottonseed cake (CSC), deoiled rice bran (DORB), wheat bran (WB), berseem <b>fodder</b> (BF), <b>maize</b> <b>fodder</b> (MF) and sorghum fodder (SF) {{were included in}} this study. Each test feed was dried, ground and chemically analysed for proximate principles (DM, CP, EE, OM, Total ash), fiber fractions (NDF, ADF, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin), NDICP and ADICP. Two adult fistulated bulls were used for evaluating the protein degradation characteristics of each test feed using the nylon bag method. Metabolizable energy (ME) content of the test feeds were predicted from their chemical composition data using summative approach of NRC (2001) model. The equations of AFRC (1992) were used to predict the rumen degradable protein (RDP), digestible microbial protein (DMP), digestible undegraded feed protein (DUP) and MP content of test feeds. Results: The MP content of MG, GNC, MOC, CSC, DORB, WB, BF, MF and SF {{was found to be}} 95. 26, 156. 41, 135. 21, 125. 06, 101. 68, 107. 11, 136. 81, 72. 01 and 76. 65 g/kg DM, respectively. The corresponding ME (MJ/kg DM) content of the test feeds was 13. 66, 13. 12, 13. 65, 10. 68, 9. 08, 11. 56, 9. 64, 8. 33 and 8. 03, respectively. Among the test feeds, GNC contained the highest and MF contained the lowest MP per kg DM. Conclusion: It was concluded that the degradability of crude protein (CP) of the test feeds can be used in MP determination and diet formulation. Feed CP content is not available as such at intestinal level in ruminants as a definite part of it undergoes extensive microbial degradation in rumen. The pattern and extent of such degradation do influence the amount of protein presented to lower digestive tract (MP) for absorption and utilization in ruminants. It was also found that the MP content of a feed is not constant as that of its CP content as it entirely depends on the degradation characteristics in a given animal...|$|R
