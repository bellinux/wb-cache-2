40|$|<b>Irritants</b> – in {{this article}} to be {{understood}} as being chemical <b>irritants</b> – are substances that may cause injuries to the skin, the eyes or the airways after a single exposure. These injuries may range from small, initially invisible injuries after exposure to weak <b>irritants</b> up to chemical burns after exposure to very strong <b>irritants</b> (i. e. corrosive substances). Prolonged or repeated exposure to weak <b>irritants</b> or a single exposure to stronger <b>irritants</b> may result in lasting health effects such as (irritative) eczema or asthma. <b>Irritants</b> are present in very many sectors and occupations. <b>Irritants</b> and the products containing them may be identified by means of their classification and labelling Labelling of chemicals as well as by using various existing lists. Prevention should include combinations of measures at source, technical and organisational measures, personal protection and hygiene, and early warning...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Irritants.</b> These are {{chemicals}} that cause an inflammatory effect on living tissue by chemical {{action at the}} site of contact. The resulting effect of <b>irritants</b> is an increase in the volume of cells due to a change in size (hypertrophy) or {{an increase in the number}} of cells (hyperplasia). Examples of <b>irritants</b> are benzaldehyde, acrolein, zinc sulphate and chlorine.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen the gastric mucosa {{is exposed}} to various <b>irritants,</b> {{apoptosis}} and subsequent gastric mucosal lesion can result in vivo. We here show that gastric <b>irritants</b> induced apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells in primary culture and examined its molecular mechanism. Ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and hydrochloric acid all induced, in a dose-dependent manner, cell death, apoptotic DNA fragmentation, and chromatin condensation, suggesting {{that each of these}} gastric <b>irritants</b> induced apoptosis in vitro. Since each of these <b>irritants</b> decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential and stimulated the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, gastric irritant-induced apoptosis seems to be mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction. Caspase- 3, caspase- 8, and caspase- 9 -like activities were all activated simultaneously by each of these <b>irritants</b> and the activation was concomitantly with cell death and apoptotic DNA fragmentation. Furthermore, pre-treatment of gastric mucosal cells with an inhibitor of caspase- 8 suppressed the onset of cell death as well as the stimulation of caspase- 3 - and caspase- 9 -like activities caused by each of these gastric <b>irritants.</b> Based on these results, we consider that caspase- 8, an initiator caspase, {{plays an important role in}} gastric irritant-induced apoptosis...|$|R
5|$|Niobium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role. While niobium dust is an eye and skin <b>irritant</b> {{and a potential}} fire hazard, elemental niobium {{on a larger scale}} is physiologically inert (and thus hypoallergenic) and harmless. It is frequently used in jewelry and has been tested for use in some medical implants.|$|E
5|$|Numerous insects utilize {{defensive}} regurgitation. The eastern {{tent caterpillar}} regurgitates a droplet of digestive fluid to repel attacking ants. Similarly, larvae of the noctuid moth regurgitate when disturbed by ants. The vomit of noctuid moths has repellent and <b>irritant</b> properties {{that help to}} deter predator attacks.|$|E

5|$|An unusual type of {{predator}} deterrence {{is observed}} in the Malaysian exploding ant. Social hymenoptera rely on altruism to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony. When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied submandibular glands, expelling corrosive <b>irritant</b> compounds and adhesives onto the predator. These prevent predation {{and serve as a}} signal to other enemy ants to stop predation {{of the rest of the}} colony.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone <b>irritant,</b> 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a tincture from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E

40|$|Individuals {{may develop}} {{symptoms}} {{in response to}} inhaled odors, chemicals, and <b>irritants.</b> This may affect their quality of life. Little {{is known about the}} prevalence and severity of symptoms that result from exposure to odors, chemicals and <b>irritants.</b> This study demonstrates {{the development of a new}} respiratory questionnaire to detect the prevalence and severity of symptoms experienced upon exposure to chemicals, odors, and <b>irritants,</b> and relates these symptoms to quality of life. This questionnaire was submitted to 96 volunteers at the University of South Florida College of Public Health who responded to items regarding symptoms developed in response to exposure to automobile exhaust, cigarette smoke, strong smells, cologne, perfumes or scented candles, or fresh paint vapors or fumes. Health-related quality of life was assessed using a subscale included with the questionnaire. The number and severity of symptoms developed in response to exposure to odors, chemicals, and <b>irritants</b> showed a strong negative correlation with health-related quality of life, consistent with intuitive estimates of the direction of this relationship. Also, it was shown that in normal populations, males and females develop statistically similar prevalence and severity of symptoms in response to exposure to odors, chemicals, and <b>irritants...</b>|$|R

5|$|Cluj-Napoca and the {{surrounding}} area (Cluj County) had a rate of 268 criminal convictions per 100,000 inhabitants during 2006, just above the national average. After the revolution in 1989, the criminal conviction rate in the county entered a phase of sustained growth, reaching a historic high of 429 in 1998, when it began to fall. Although the overall crime rate is reassuringly low, petty crime can be an <b>irritant</b> for foreigners, as in other large cities of Romania. During the 1990s, two large financial institutions, Banca Dacia Felix and Caritas, went bankrupt due to large-scale fraud and embezzlement.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 {{a series}} of {{revolutions}} struck Europe: the July Revolution in France, the Belgian Revolution and smaller revolts in Italy threatened to overthrow the framework of European politics established at the Congress of Vienna. As the Russian tsars were among the strongest advocates of that status quo, the uprising in Poland and the ousting of the tsar as the king of Poland by the Sejm and Senate of Poland on 25 January 1831 were considered a serious <b>irritant.</b> Russia could not send its armies to Belgium or France before the rebellion in Poland was quelled. For that reason the capture of Warsaw was Russia's main target in the war {{from the start of}} hostilities.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{ytterbium}} is {{a mixture}} of seven stable isotopes, which altogether are present at concentrations of 3 parts per million. This element is mined in China, the United States, Brazil, and India in form of the minerals monazite, euxenite, and xenotime. The ytterbium concentration is low because it is found only among many other rare earth elements; moreover, it is among the least abundant.

5|$|Freshly cut onions often cause a {{stinging}} sensation {{in the eyes}} of people nearby, and often uncontrollable tears. This is caused by the release of a volatile gas, syn-propanethial-S-oxide, which stimulates nerves in the eye creating {{a stinging}} sensation. This gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism: chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases. These break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the lacrimatory factor synthase, producing the syn-propanethial-S-oxide. This gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. Lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the <b>irritant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen cyanide, {{discovered}} in the late 18th century, {{was used in the}} 1880s for the fumigation of citrus trees in California. Its use spread to other countries for the fumigation of silos, goods wagons, ships, and mills. Its light weight and rapid dispersal meant its application had to take place under tents or in enclosed areas. Research by Fritz Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry led to the founding in 1919 of Deutsche Gesellschaft für Schädlingsbekämpfung mbH (Degesch), a state-controlled consortium formed to investigate military use of the chemical. Chemists at Degesch added a cautionary eye <b>irritant</b> to a less volatile cyanide compound which reacted with water in the presence of heat to become hydrogen cyanide. The new product was marketed as the pesticide Zyklon (cyclone). As a similar formula had been used as a weapon by the Germans during World War I, Zyklon was soon banned.|$|E
5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that spiders' coloration is camouflage that helps them to evade their major predators, birds and parasitic wasps, {{both of which have}} good color vision. Many spider species are colored so as to merge with their most common backgrounds, and some have disruptive coloration, stripes and blotches that break up their outlines. In a few species, such as the Hawaiian happy-face spider, Theridion grallator, several coloration schemes are present in a ratio that appears to remain constant, and this may {{make it more difficult for}} predators to recognize the species. Most spiders are insufficiently dangerous or unpleasant-tasting for warning coloration to offer much benefit. However, a few species with powerful venoms, large jaws or <b>irritant</b> hairs have patches of warning colors, and some actively display these colors when threatened.|$|E
