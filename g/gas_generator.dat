25|$|In recent years, {{the rocket}} pack has become popular among enthusiasts, {{and some have}} built them for themselves.

25|$|In March 2009, however, {{outgoing}} CEO of GM Rick Wagoner {{said the}} biggest mistake he ever made as chief executive was killing the EV1 car and failing to direct more resources to electrics and hybrids after such an early lead in this technology.

25|$|Pyrophoric flares {{work on the}} {{principle}} of ejecting a special pyrophoric material out of an airtight cartridge, usually using a <b>gas</b> <b>generator,</b> e.g. a small pyrotechnic charge or pressurized gas. The material then self-ignites in contact with air. The materials can be solid, e.g. iron platelets coated with ultrafine aluminium, or liquid, often organometallic compounds; e.g. alkyl aluminium compounds, e.g. triethylaluminium. Pyrophoric flares may have reduced effectiveness at high altitudes, due to lower air temperature and lower availability of oxygen; however oxygen can be co-ejected with the pyrophoric fuel.|$|E
25|$|By 1 October 1861, {{the first}} balloon, the Union, {{was ready for}} action. Though it lacked a {{portable}} <b>gas</b> <b>generator,</b> it was called into immediate service. It was gassed up in Washington and towed overnight to Lewinsville via Chain Bridge. The fully covered and trellised bridge required that the towing handlers crawl over the bridge beams and stringers to cross the upper Potomac River into Fairfax County. The balloon and crew arrived by daylight, exhausted from the nine-hour overnight ordeal, when a gale-force wind took the balloon away. It was later recovered, but not before Lowe, who was humiliated by the incident, went on a tirade about the delays in providing proper equipment.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen's low {{viscosity}} and high thermal conductivity {{make it the}} most powerful working gas, primarily because the engine can run faster than with other gases. However, because of hydrogen absorption, and given the high diffusion rate associated with this low molecular weight gas, particularly at high temperatures, H2 leaks through the solid metal of the heater. Diffusion through carbon steel is too high to be practical, but may be acceptably low for metals such as aluminum, or even stainless steel. Certain ceramics also greatly reduce diffusion. Hermetic pressure vessel seals are necessary to maintain pressure inside the engine without replacement of lost gas. For high temperature differential (HTD) engines, auxiliary systems {{may need to be}} added to maintain high pressure working fluid. These systems can be a gas storage bottle or a <b>gas</b> <b>generator.</b> Hydrogen can be generated by electrolysis of water, the action of steam on red hot carbon-based fuel, by gasification of hydrocarbon fuel, or by the reaction of acid on metal. Hydrogen can also cause the embrittlement of metals. Hydrogen is a flammable gas, which is a safety concern if released from the engine.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{his most}} {{significant}} engineering failure, {{as noted by}} division chief Yuri Demyanko, was his insistence that hydrogen was unsuitable {{for use as a}} rocket fuel. As a result, the Soviet space program was still discussing the use of hydrogen-fueled engines while the Americans were assembling the Saturn V launcher. Also, Glushko's design bureau consistently failed at building a rocket engine powered by LOX/Kerosene with a large combustion chamber to rival the American F1 used on the Saturn V; instead, his solution was the RD-270, a single large combustion-chamber engine powered by hypergolic fuels which had almost the same thrust and better specific impulse as compared to the US F-1 rocket engine in addition to using the very advanced full-flow staged combustion concept as opposed to the simple <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> cycle used by the F-1 rocket engine. This was a primary reason for the failure of the N1, which was forced to rely on a multitude of smaller engines for propulsion because Sergei Korolev, its chief designer, insisted on using the LOX/Kerosene combination, which Glushko felt would take much more time and money to design. Glushko never did overcome the combustion instability problems of large rocket motors using kerosene propellants; his eventual solution for this is seen on the RD-170 which is basically four smaller combustion chamber/nozzle assemblies sharing common fuel delivery systems. This solution and engine gave the Soviets the large thrust propulsion needed to build the Energia superbooster, and is probably the finest technical example of Glushko's abilities when he was at his best. The fact that he never developed this solution until the firing of Vasily Mishin and his gaining ultimate control of the entire Soviet space program {{is a testament to the}} paralyzing intrigue and in-fighting that went on within the Soviet effort to reach the Moon.|$|E

500|$|Both the Russians and the Germans later used weapons {{described}} as fougasse flame throwers or flame thrower mines. They {{worked on a}} different principle to the flame fougasse. Fougasse flame throwers comprised a cylinder containing a few gallons of gasoline and oil; this would be hidden, typically by being buried. On being triggered electrically, either by an operator or by a booby trap mechanism, a <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> is ignited. The pressure ruptures a thin metal seal and the liquid is forced up a central pipe and out through one or more nozzles. A squib is automatically fired to ignite the fuel. The range of the flame varied considerably, generally just a few tens of yards and lasted only one to two seconds. The German weapons, the Abwehrflammenwerfer 42, had an [...] fuel tank and were wired back to a control point from {{where they could be}} fired individually or together.|$|E
500|$|Each ten foot {{diameter}} balloon {{was filled}} with one-third oxygen and two-thirds hydrogen. To do this, the empty balloon was {{spread out on the}} ground with plenty of room around it. It was then attached to a hose to start filling with oxygen gas. The other end of the hose went to a retort that {{was filled with}} chlorinate of potassium and a small amount of manganese oxide. The retort was heated to a high temperature through a gasoline burner. Oxygen gas, generated at 600 cubic feet per hour, went through a lime-water wash and from there to fill the balloon. The balloon was filled up one third of the way. The hose was then connected to the hydrogen <b>gas</b> <b>generator</b> and filled up the remaining two-thirds of the way. The oxygen and hydrogen balloon was referred to as an [...] "oxy-hydrogen" [...] balloon. Each gas had an electric fuse detonator inside, which made it a type of [...] "bomb" [...] when triggered electrically. Wires were used that led from the ground to the balloon and when an electrical charge was made by a dynamo, it passed through the wires to set off the detonator causing an explosion that was brighter than the sun. This caused the oxygen and hydrogen to react, creating water (H2O). This man-made water then acted as a nucleus for making rain out of the atmosphere.|$|E
