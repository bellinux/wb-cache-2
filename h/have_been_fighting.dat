5|$|In 1934, Abbe {{moved to}} Kyoto {{with his mother}} and his sister Toyoka so that he could attend Busen, {{training}} in both the judo and kendo programmes. Abbe learned kendo under the direction of Busen's head sword instructor, Kinnosuke Ogawa, a master who held the rank of 10th dan. He recalled that his instructor, at the age of 75 years, was so skilled that he could not be touched by any of the students or younger instructors. Every Saturday afternoon at Busen, following tradition, judo tournaments were held. Abbe fought five opponents in succession with each contest lasting five minutes, and he won all or almost all of these matches. In his first year at Busen, he was promoted to 4th dan in judo. In the autumn of his second year there, he was promoted to 5th dan, by which time he was reported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> 20 opponents in succession.|$|E

25|$|Merchants in the United States <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> {{what they}} {{consider}} to be unfairly high fees charged by credit card companies in a series of lawsuits that started in 2005. Merchants charged that the two main credit card processing companies, MasterCard and Visa, used their monopoly power to levy excessive fees in a class-action lawsuit involving the National Retail Federation and major retailers such as Wal-Mart. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a $5.7 billion settlement in the case that offered payouts to merchants who had paid credit card fees, the largest antitrust settlement in U.S. history. Some large retailers, such as Wal-Mart and Amazon, chose to not participate in this settlement, however, and have continued their legal fight against the credit card companies.|$|E
25|$|This is what McDonald thinks, {{but other}} historians such as Seán Duffy {{have taken it}} to refer to Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the {{progenitor}} of Clan Donald. Alex Woolf argued that Donnchadh was probably too old at this stage to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> in Ireland, and suggests that the probable identity of this man was Ruaídhrí mac Raghnaill. Sellar also believes that Donnchadh {{would have been too}} old, and also suggests identifying this man with Ruaidhrí mac Raghnaill. Donnchadh appeared in Scottish sources in 1237, and again, for the last time, in 1244, as one of the magnates whose names were attached to a letter from Alexander II to the Pope. His son Eóghan appears to have been fully in charge of the lordship by 1249, probably indicating that Donnchadh was dead by this point.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, the Central Park Conservancy, the United States Department of Agriculture, and several {{city and state}} {{agencies}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> an infestation of the Asian long-horned beetle, which {{has been reported in}} Long Island and Manhattan, including some parts of Central Park. The beetle, which likely was accidentally shipped from its native China in an untreated shipping crate, has no natural predators in the United States, and the fight to contain its infestation has been very expensive. The beetle infests trees by boring a hole in them to deposit its eggs, at which point the only way to end the infestation is to destroy the tree. Several thousand trees were infected in the city and later removed, including 2 trees that were removed from Central Park.|$|E
25|$|Park Row, {{historically}} a major artery {{linking the}} Financial District to Chinatown and the Bowery, {{has been closed}} to civilian traffic since 2001. The NYPD asserts that this is necessary to protect its headquarters from a truck bomb attack. Chinatown residents are increasingly frustrated at the disruption caused by {{the closure of the}} thoroughfare, especially nearby residents. People who live nearby argue that the police department has placed a chokehold on an entire neighborhood and that if One Police Plaza is such an obvious terrorist target, perhaps it should be moved from a residential area. Members of the Civic Center Residents Coalition <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> the security perimeter around the building for years. Park Row reopened for use only by foot traffic and MTA buses in 2005, and those restrictions remain in place today.|$|E
25|$|Insurgents of the Rohingya ethnic {{minority}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> local government forces and other insurgent groups in northern Rakhine State since 1948, with ongoing religious violence between the predominantly Muslim Rohingyas and Buddhist Rakhines fueling the conflict. The {{legal and political}} rights of the Rohingya people have been an underlying issue in the conflict, with spontaneous bouts of violence such as the 2012 Rakhine State riots and 2013 Myanmar anti-Muslim riots periodically occurring as a result. Despite making up {{a majority of the}} population in the three northern townships of Rakhine State, Rohingyas are often targets of religiously motivated attacks. Because the government does not recognise the Rohingya people as an official ethnic group in Myanmar, Rohingyas cannot apply for citizenship and few laws exist to protect their rights.|$|E

John Schlight, in his A War Too Long, said of the PAVN's logistical apparatus:"This sustained effort, requiring the full-time activities {{of tens of thousands}} of soldiers, who might otherwise <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> in South Vietnam, seems proof positive that the bombing of the Ho Chi Minh Trail had disrupted the North Vietnamese war effort." ...|$|E
500|$|From {{the text}} itself, the ending is ambiguous: {{according}} to one view, Batman breaks the Joker's neck out of panel, causing the laughter to stop abruptly. Some people theorise that the title, [...] "The Killing Joke" [...] is {{in reference to the}} ending scene, in which The Joker and Batman laugh, over a joke, thus triggering Batman to kill The Joker. According to another view, Batman and the Joker, who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> for years, end all of their disputes by having a good laugh about it all. Still another theory maintains that the first and last panels of the book are both purposely of rain falling on the ground, which symbolizes that nothing has changed except for the two parties' respect for each other.|$|E
500|$|Tahil's casting was {{considered}} to be controversial, and was slammed by British Asian actors who said the part should have been given to a UK actor, referring to it as [...] "disgraceful". Actors Albert Moses and Renu Setna complained that home-grown talent was being overlooked, with Moses saying, [...] "British Asian actors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fighting</b> {{for the last five years}} to persuade the BBC to bring an Asian family into EastEnders and when at last it happens it goes to Bollywood. It is a disgrace and an insult to British Asian actors. This is a terrible thing for the BBC to do. It should be ashamed." [...] Setna said: [...] "I have heard that for this storyline the BBC has brought over a Bollywood star to play the father. Why, when we have excellent Asian actors of our own?" [...] British immigration laws state that nationals from outside the European Union should not replace resident actors capable of doing the same work. A spokesperson for the BBC responded: [...] "After due consideration, Dalip was deemed to be the most appropriate actor for the job." [...] Additionally, it was suggested that Madhur Jaffrey was miscast in the role of Dan's wife Pushpa.|$|E
