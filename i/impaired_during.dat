5|$|Born in Clayton, New Mexico, to {{a working-class}} family, Anderson was left {{visually}} <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> childhood. His family regularly moved around within the United States during his early years, with Anderson claiming that encounters with Mexican, Hawaiian, and Haitian migrants led to him gaining an early {{understanding of these}} various cultures' magical practices. The family eventually settled in Oregon, and Anderson later claimed that {{it was here that}} he was initiated into a tradition of witchcraft by an African woman. He later claimed that, in 1932, he joined a magico-religious group known as the Harpy Coven which was based in Ashland and which dissolved in the 1940s. According to his description, the group was devoted to a god and goddess, Setan and Lilith, and were influenced by both American folk magic and Huna.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the items}} on the Alcohol Dependence scale most {{positively}} related to their prenatal alcohol exposure includes [...] "blacking out". [...] Blackouts are alcohol-related amnesia, occurring when long term memory creation is <b>impaired</b> <b>during</b> a drinking episode, resulting in an inability to remember. The frequency of blackouts in young adults while drinking is strongly related to prenatal alcohol exposure; those exposed to alcohol as a fetus are more vulnerable to experiencing blackouts as an adult.Prenatal alcohol exposure can also lead to decreased problem solving skills and/or attention deficits. Attention deficits result in an inability to maintain focus on one task for a length of time, and being prone to distraction.|$|E

40|$|ABCA 1, {{a member}} of the ATP-binding {{cassette}} family of transporters, lipidates ApoE (apolipoprotein A) and is essential for the generation of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) -like particles in the CNS (central nervous system).

We hypothesized that deletion of only one copy of Abca 1 in APP 23 (where APP is amyloid precursor protein) AD model mice will aggravate memory deficits in these mice. Using the Morris Water Maze, we demonstrate that 2 -year-old Abca 1 heterozygous APP 23 mice (referred to as APP 23 /het) have <b>impaired</b> learning <b>during</b> acquisition, and <b>impaired</b> memory retention <b>during</b> the probe trial when compared with agematched wild-type mice (referred to as APP 23 /wt).

Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in sepsis and associated with a worse outcome. We used a mouse model of pneumonia-derived sepsis caused by the human pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae to study the role of platelets in host response to sepsis. Platelet counts were reduced to < 1 % or to 1 - 9 % by administration of a depleting antibody in mice infected with Klebsiella via the airways. Thrombocytopenia was associated with a strongly <b>impaired</b> survival <b>during</b> pneumonia-derived sepsis proportional to the extent of platelet depletion. Thrombocytopenic mice demonstrated platelet count dependent enhanced bacterial growth in lungs, blood and distant organs. Severe thrombocytopenia resulted in hemorrhage at the primary site of infection, but not in distant organs...|$|R

40|$|Purpose of {{the present}} work is to {{investigate}} the mutagenic effects of ionizing radiations (gamma rays) on Brassica campestris L. accession no - IC 363713. Homogeneous seeds of Brassica were irradiated at four doses of gamma rays i. e. 150 Gy, 300 Gy, 450 Gy and 600 Gy by the gamma-chamber type 60 Co at the dose rate of 2 second/Gy. During microsporogenesis, meiotic analysis of young floral buds {{was carried out in}} irradiated as well as non-irradiated plant materials. Meiotic study clearly revealed the meiotic malfunctioning of pollen mother cells (PMCs) that had shared copious count of cytological abnormalities namely unorientation, stickiness, precocious movement or fragmentation, secondary association of bivalents, asynchronous division, laggards, tripolarity and chromatin bridge. These aberrations were found to be distributed in all the phases of male meiosis. However, this <b>impairing</b> <b>during</b> meiosis has found to be collinearly associated with doses i. e. inclining tendency of abnormality percentage alongwith increasing doses were registered. Perhaps aforementioned chromosomal aberrations may be introduced by asymmetrical distribution of chromatin material in PMCs, had definitely compromised with pollen fertility, resulting the increased frequency of pollen sterility.
