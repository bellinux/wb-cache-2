5|$|France {{declared}} war on Britain in February 1793, and Gibraltar was recommissioned under Captain Thomas Mackenzie in May 1793. In September she was refitted {{at a cost of}} £17,485 before joining the Channel Fleet under Richard Lord Howe. As part of this fleet, Gibraltar, on 2May 1794, accompanied the East and West India and Newfoundland convoys along the Channel as far as Lizard Point. Howe then divided his force, sending eight ships-of-the-line and four or five frigates to escort the convoys further. The remaining 26 ships-of-the-line, including Gibraltar, set off to search for a large <b>Franco-American</b> grain convoy known to be heading to France.|$|E
5|$|The French fleet {{arrived at}} Delaware Bay on 8 July 1778, under Admiral d'Estaing, with whom General Washington planned to attack Newport, Rhode Island, {{the other major}} British base in the north. Lafayette and General Greene were sent with a 3,000-man force to {{participate}} in the attack. Lafayette wanted to control a joint <b>Franco-American</b> force but was rebuffed by the admiral. On 9 August, the American land force attacked the British without consulting d'Estaing. When the Americans asked the admiral to place his ships in Narragansett Bay, d'Estaing refused and, at sea, sought to defeat the British fleet. The fighting was inconclusive as a storm scattered and damaged both fleets.|$|E

5|$|British {{naval forces}} in North America and the West Indies were weaker than the {{combined}} fleets of France and Spain, and, after much indecision by British naval commanders, the French fleet gained control over Chesapeake Bay, landing forces near Yorktown. The Royal Navy attempted to dispute this {{control in the}} key Battle of the Chesapeake on 5 September but Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves was defeated. Protected from the sea by French ships, <b>Franco-American</b> forces surrounded, besieged and forced the surrender of British forces commanded by General Cornwallis, concluding major operations in North America. When the news reached London, the government of Lord Frederick North fell, and the following Rockingham ministry entered into peace negotiations. These culminated in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, in which King George III recognised {{the independence of the}} United States of America.|$|E

In the first <b>Franco-American</b> campaign, a French fleet {{commanded}} by Vice-Admiral Comte Charles Henri Hector d'Estaing attempted landings in New York and Newport, but due to a combination of poor co-ordination and bad weather, d'Estaing and Vice-Admiral Lord Richard Howe naval forces did not engage during 1778. After the French fleet departed, the British turned their attention to the south. In 1779, the French fleet returned to assist American forces attempting to recapture Savannah from British forces.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, {{the treaty}} pushed American {{diplomatic}} relations away from France and towards Great Britain, as the French government {{concluded that it}} violated the <b>Franco-American</b> treaty of 1778, and that the U.S. government had accepted the treaty against the overwhelming public sentiment against it. This set {{up a series of}} diplomatic and political conflicts over the ensuing four years, culminating in {{what became known as the}} Quasi-War.

5|$|The Battle of the Chesapeake, {{also known}} as the Battle of the Virginia Capes or simply the Battle of the Capes, was a crucial naval battle in the American Revolutionary War that took place near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay on 5 September 1781. The combatants were a British fleet led by Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves and a French fleet led by Rear Admiral Francois Joseph Paul, the Comte de Grasse. The battle was {{strategically}} decisive, in that it prevented the Royal Navy from reinforcing or evacuating the forces of Lieutenant General Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia. The French were able to achieve control of the sea lanes against the British, allowing them to provide the <b>Franco-American</b> army with siege artillery and French reinforcements—all of which proved decisive in the Siege of Yorktown, effectively securing independence for the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E
5|$|By 1875, France {{was enjoying}} {{improved}} political stability and a recovering postwar economy. Growing {{interest in the}} upcoming Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide {{it was time to}} seek public support. In September 1875, he announced the project and the formation of the <b>Franco-American</b> Union as its fundraising arm. With the announcement, the statue was given a name, Liberty Enlightening the World. The French would finance the statue; Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal. The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France, though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia. French monarchists opposed the statue, {{if for no other reason}} than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye, who had recently been elected a senator for life. Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful, including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25, 1876, that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod. The piece was titled La Liberté éclairant le monde, the French version of the statue's announced name.|$|E

Among the American guns there were three twenty-four pounders, three {{eighteen}} pounders, two eight-inch (203mm) howitzers and six mortars, totaling fourteen guns. At 3:00pm, the French guns opened the barrage and drove the British frigate, HMS Guadeloupe across the York River, where she was scuttled to prevent capture. At 5:00pm the Americans opened fire. Washington fired the first gun; {{legend has it that}} this shot smashed into a table where British officers were eating. The <b>Franco-American</b> guns began to tear apart the British defenses. Washington ordered that the guns fire all night so that the British could not make repairs. All of the British guns on the left were soon silenced.

Some British ships were also damaged by cannonballs that flew across the town into the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Vigilant was {{generally}} inactive while the British occupied Philadelphia, but she sailed to New York City when the British evacuated {{the city in}} June 1778.

The ship accompanied the British squadron to Newport, Rhode Island as it attempted to lift the <b>Franco-American</b> siege, but Vigilant was badly damaged when a storm interrupted the planned battle on 13 August. Despite the damage, she supported British troops on 29–30 August as they pursued the retreating Americans who had abandoned the siege after the French ships sailed to Boston for repairs. A few days later, on 4 September, the ship collided with the sloop-of-war Raven during the British raid on New London, Connecticut and had her bow stove in by the other ship. Vigilant was quickly repaired in New York and participated in the attack on Little Egg Harbor River in October.|$|E

40|$|This project {{undertakes}} {{the study}} {{of a collection of}} French-Canadian folk songs arising from the experience of the emigration of French-Canadians to the United States in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The primary methodological tools employed in this study stem generally from the field of the history of religions, and specifically from the work of Charles H. Long. Religion here is understood as a mode of orientation that locates an individual or group meaningfully in the world in relation to ultimate reality. Religion can arise from situations of cultural contact and, therefore, is fundamentally important to issues of community and identity. As such, these songs articulate a mode of negotiating modernity that recognizes the homogenizing and silencing character of its discourse while simultaneously suggesting an understanding of human communities based on the recognition of the exchange of matter that served as the locus of the identity of <b>Franco-Americans...</b>|$|R

40|$|Approximately {{1 million}} French-Canadians {{moved to the}} United States, mainly between 1865 and 1930, and most settled in {{neighboring}} New England. In 1900 almost a fifth of all persons born in French Canada lived in the U. S. These migrants exerted considerable efforts to maintain their language and to replicate their home country institutions, most notably the schooling system, in their new country. For decades, this resistance to assimilation generated considerable attention and concern in the U. S. The concerns are strikingly similar to those often invoked today in discussions of immigration from Hispanic countries, notably Mexico. Mexicans may not be assimilating into mainstream America as European immigrants did. We look at the convergence in the educational attainment of French Canadian immigrants across generations relative to native English-speaking New Englanders and to European Roman Catholic immigrants. The educational attainment of <b>Franco-Americans</b> lagged that of their fellow citizens {{over a long period}} of time. By the time of the 2000 Census, they appear to have largely achieved parity. The effects of World War II, especially military service, were very important in speeding up the assimilation process through a variety of related channels: educational attainment, language assimilation, marrying outside the ethnic group, and moving out of New England. Economic assimilation was very gradual because of the persistence of ethnic enclaves. ...|$|R
40|$|Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) {{results from}} {{mutations}} in HEXA that cause Hex A deficiency. Heterozygote-screening {{programs have been}} applied in groups with an increased TSD incidence, such as Ashkenazi Jews and French Canadians in Quebec. These programs are complicated by benign mutations that cause apparent Hex A deficiency but not TSD. Benign mutations account for only approximately 2 % of Jewish and approximately 36 % of non-Jewish enzyme-defined carriers. A carrier frequency of 1 / 53 (n = 1, 434) was found in an ongoing prospective analysis of persons of French Canadian background living in New England by using an enzyme-based assay. DNA from enzyme-defined carriers from this population was analyzed to determine the molecular basis of Hex A deficiency. Samples (36) were tested for common mutations, and samples that were negative for these were screened for uncommon or novel mutations by using SSCP analysis. Exons showing mobility shifts were sequenced, and most mutations were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion. Known disease-causing mutations were found in nine samples (four had a 7. 6 -kb deletion found in 80 % of French Canadian TSD alleles), and known benign mutations were found in four samples. Seven novel changes were identified, including G 748 A in four samples. The molecular basis of Hex A deficiency in this carrier population {{differs from that of}} French Canadian TSD patients.

50|$|In 1917, {{the first}} Old Catholic parish {{was built by}} Bishop Franciszek Hodur of the Polish National Catholic Church which {{was a member of}} the Union of Utrecht until 2003. Parishes were also {{constructed}} in Woonsocket and in the neighboring, Fall River, Massachusetts. Bishop Vilatte of the American Catholic Church was a colleague of his Polish counterparts and visited the communities in Rhode Island and Fall River. Many of these churches are still active today. In the April 1928 issue of the American Catholic Church newsletter, The Antiochean, Dr. Casmir Durand, is consecrated Bishop of the French-speaking churches and successor of Joseph Rene Vilatte. In May, Henri Perdriau of Rhode Island gave him his support and invited the <b>Franco-Americans</b> to join the church. He published under Bishop Durand's Imprimatur, and with his collaboration, the brochure called Fiat Lux- Le bon sens et la logique (common sense and logic). It was written after Rome had excommunicated the 56 leaders of a movement that was opposing the Roman Catholic Bishop W. Hickey of Providence, under the auspices of the newspaper La Sentinelle of Woonsocket, where Perdriau was a journalist. Bishop Hickey was forcing the French-speaking parishes of his diocese to fund English schools only, through compulsory taxes. Perdriau was also the master of Guido Nincheri who produced the famous stained glass and frescos found in St. Ann's Church in Woonsocket. Members of this new parish came from St. Ann's Church and Precious Blood Church.|$|R

New England was industrializing, approximately 900,000 French-Canadians who lived in Quebec (Some were of other French origins e.g. Acadian) left Quebec to go and find a job in the United States. Only around 50% of the migrants reported returning to Canada. The French-Canadians and other Frenchmen who stayed got together to form communities known as [...] "Little Canadas". A vast number of Americans with French ancestry trace it back to Quebec. Other <b>Franco-Americans,</b> particularly the ones from the South, were originally from Acadia - the Cajuns - and there were a few from France directly. Up until the year 1849, the Catholic Church was not allowed to purchase any additional land, or found any parishes in the Eastern Townships due to English Protestant laws and control. By orders of Father Bernard O'Reilley, an Association des Townships was founded in 1848 to promote settlement in the area of Canada. In the 1850s, the association bought lands which were then given to young families of farmers to prevent them from leaving for the United States where it was believed they would ultimately be assimilated.|$|R
50|$|Goguen became {{interested}} in politics early in life. At the age of 29 {{he was elected to}} the Leominster City Council. In 1928 he campaigned for Democratic presidential candidate Al Smith in both English and French. From 1932 to 1934, Goguen was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. During the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Goguen received a federal appointment as the deputy collector of internal revenue for Massachusetts. On May 17, 1939, Roosevelt nominated Goguen for the position of United States Marshal for the District of Massachusetts. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 12 and was sworn in on July 1. He was appointed to a second four-year term in 1943, but did not seek a third term in 1947. From 1946-1974, Goguen was the President General of Union Saint-Jean-Baptiste, a national fraternal order and social club for <b>Franco-Americans.</b> Goguen was named acting Secretary of the Commonwealth on December 1, 1958 following the death of Edward J.

40|$|Using U. S. and Canadian {{census data}} I exploit the massive out {{migration}} of approximately 1 million French-Canadians who moved mainly to New England between 1865 and 1930 {{to look at}} how the educational attainment and enrollment patterns of their descendants compare with those of same aged French-speaking Quebeckers. Data from the 1971 (1970) Canadian (U. S.) censuses reveal that New England born residents who had French as their mother tongue enjoyed a considerable advantage in terms of educational attainment. I attribute this large discrepancy to their exposure to the U. S. public school system which had no equivalent in Quebec until the late sixties. This result is even more remarkable given the alleged negative selection out of Quebec and the fact that <b>Franco-Americans</b> were fairly successful in replicating the same educational institutions as the ones existing in Quebec. Turning to the 2001 (2000) Canadian (U. S.) censuses, I find strong signs that the gap has subsided for the younger aged individuals. In fact, contrary to 30 years earlier, young Quebeckers in 2001 had roughly the same number of years of schooling and were at least as likely to have some post-secondary education. However, they still trail when it comes to having at least a B. A. degree. This partial reversal reects the impact of the "reverse treatment" by which Quebec made profound changes to its educational institutions, particularly in the post-secondary system, in the mid-to-late 60 's. Given the speed at which this partial catch-up occurred, {{it would appear that the}} magnitude of the intergenerational externalities that can be associated with education is at best fairly modest.
