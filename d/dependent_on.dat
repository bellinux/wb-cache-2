5|$|The {{biology of}} life {{operates}} {{within a certain}} range of temperatures. Heat {{is a form of}} energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and primary production. Temperature is largely <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> the incidence of solar radiation. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of temperature greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of biodiversity and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. Poikilotherms, for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and <b>dependent</b> <b>on</b> the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, homeotherms regulate their internal body temperature by expending metabolic energy.|$|E
