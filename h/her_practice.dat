5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. <b>Her</b> <b>practice</b> had grown large {{enough for her to}} need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became a key part of Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the {{characterisation}} of Shashthi {{underwent a}} gradual evolution. Aforementioned folk traditions originating between the 10th and 5th centuries BCE associated the goddess with {{both positive and}} negative elements of fertility, birth, motherhood and childhood. However, between the 4th century BCE and the 5th century CE, a shift occurred in which Shashthi was increasingly depicted as a malevolent deity associated with the sufferings of mothers and children. The fifth century text Kashyapa Samhita calls Shashthi by the epithet Jataharini ("one who steals the born") and provides a list of the malevolent activities in which Shashthi is believed to engage, including <b>her</b> <b>practice</b> of stealing foetuses from the womb and devouring children on the sixth day following birth. For this reason, the text recommends that she be propitiated through worship in her honour on this day in the lying-in room and on the sixth day of every fortnight thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The artist {{held her}} first solo show in Tunis in 2009, and {{subsequent}} solo shows in Berlin (2010), the Mosaic Rooms of Earl's Court (London, 2014), and the Dallas Contemporary (2015). Kaabi-Linke received the 2009 Alexandria Biennale's Jury Prize and the 2011 Abraaj Group Art Prize. The latter commissioned her 2011 Flying Carpets, which was {{shown at the}} 54th Venice Biennale and later purchased by and exhibited at the New York Guggenheim Museum in 2016. Kaabi-Linke held a residency at the London Delfina Foundation in 2012, where she was inspired after meeting survivors of domestic violence. She won the Discoveries Prize for emerging art at the 2014 Art Basel Hong Kong, where she exhibited with the Kolkatan Experimenter gallery. One of the judges juxtaposed the social content of her work against the political reservations of other exhibitions in the show. Earlier that year, she completed her Meinstein ("My Stone") project {{in the center of}} Neukölln, a borough of Berlin. Her pavement mosaic uses stones that correspond to the national origins of the borough's residents, which is a largely immigrant population. She described <b>her</b> <b>practice,</b> at that time, as an archaeology of contemporary life. As of 2016, Kaabi-Linke is represented by Lawrie Shabibi of Dubai and Experimenter of Kolkata.|$|E

25|$|At that time, the men's {{basketball}} team at Indiana was coached by future Hall of Fame coach Bobby Knight. While Knight {{was not a}} direct influence on VanDerveer's choice of school, {{he may have been}} had an indirect effect. The Indiana women's coach, Bea Gorton, patterned her style of play and practices after Knight, and it was the observation of the style of play at the AIAW event that persuaded her to choose Indiana. The effect would become more direct. Because Gorton designed <b>her</b> <b>practices</b> based upon what she observed from Knight, VanDerveer started attending Knight's practices to see what she would be doing later that day in practice. VanDerveer carried what she learned from Knight to <b>her</b> <b>practices</b> at Stanford.|$|R

40|$|Teachers {{beliefs and}} their {{implicit}} theories about their students intelligence, abilities {{and the ways}} in which they learn, determines their approach to teaching. Many teachers in Pakistan conceive intelligence as an ability possessed by a few individuals in their classrooms. This notion has lead to teacher 2 ̆ 7 s categorisation of their students according to their cognitive abilities. On the other hand, teachers play an active role in transmitting knowledge to the students through passive participation and rote learning. This makes student receivers of knowledge rather than potential users and producers of knowledge. This case study, therefore, explores a teacher 2 ̆ 7 s belief about the notion of intelligence and <b>her</b> classroom <b>practices</b> in which the teacher engages. It also studies the implications of these beliefs for <b>her</b> classroom <b>practices.</b> Finding reveals that the teacher had certain beliefs and conceptions about the ability and intelligence of her students and the way they learn. These beliefs have implications for teachers 2 ̆ 7 attitude and behaviour towards different ability groups, their classroom interaction and feedback to their students, the use of pedagogical content knowledge, and their students self-image. The study also reveals that there is a relationship between teacher 2 ̆ 7 s beliefs and <b>her</b> <b>practices.</b> This relationship is hindered sometimes by other factors in her workplace. By engaging the teacher in critical reflection on both her beliefs and <b>her</b> <b>practices,</b> the teacher was able to re-conceptualise the implications of her conceptions of intelligence and slightly changed <b>her</b> <b>practices</b> in the classroom. These changed practices brought significant changes in the teachers attitude and students learning which made the teacher re-conceptualise many of her beliefs and conceptions about intelligence...|$|R

25|$|Ujjayi {{breathing}} {{may be used}} continuously throughout Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga, and {{is frequently}} used in Power Yoga and Vinyasa, or Flow Yoga. This breath enables the practitioner to maintain a rhythm to his or <b>her</b> <b>practice,</b> take in enough oxygen, and helps build energy to maintain practice, while clearing toxins out of the bodily system. This breath is especially important during transition {{into and out of}} asanas (postures), as it helps practitioners to stay present, self-aware and grounded in the practice, which lends it a meditative quality.|$|E
25|$|Captain Doctor Lakshmi Swaminathan (later married as Lakshmi Sehgal) was the Minister in Charge of Women's Organization. She {{held this}} {{position}} {{over and above}} her command of the Rani Jhansi Regiment, a brigade of women soldiers fighting for the Indian National Army.

25|$|Hon. Cynthia D. Kinser, former Justice (Chief Justice 2011-2014). Because Chief Justice Kinser {{returned}} {{to the practice of}} law after she retired from the court, she is not currently subject to recall for service on the Court because of the ethical conflict this would create between <b>her</b> <b>practice</b> of the law and her role as a justice. Moreover, justices serving in senior status or sitting by designation must be receiving benefits from the Virginia Retirement System, and under the rules applying to judges and justices, receipt of retirement benefits precludes the judge or justice from engaging in the private practice of law.|$|E

25|$|Temple {{had already}} {{appeared}} in five films released in 1934, and had performed a tap routine with James Dunn in Stand Up and Cheer! After Robinson {{was signed by}} 20th Century Fox, {{it was decided that}} he would perform his famous stair dance with Temple. While Robinson liked the idea, he quickly realized that he could not teach his complex stair dance to a seven-year-old in the few days permitted by the shooting schedule. Instead, he taught Temple to kick the riser (face) of each stairstep with her toe. After watching <b>her</b> <b>practice</b> his choreography, Robinson modified his routine to mimic her movements, so that it appeared on film that she was imitating his steps. The sequence was the highlight of the film.|$|E
500|$|As the Farrar {{children}} grew old enough, {{they were}} enrolled in The Pembroke Hill School, a private school in Kansas City. Green was reportedly a good mother who wanted the best for her children and encouraged them in their activities of choice.

500|$|Keene's {{career as}} the [...] "Eagle Lady" [...] began {{shortly after her}} arrival in Homer, when one morning she noticed two bald eagles on the beach near her motorhome. Keene saw {{offering}} food to the eagles as {{a natural extension of}} <b>her</b> <b>practice</b> of keeping bird feeders filled with sunflower seeds for wild songbirds. She began to bring home surplus fish in a bucket from her job, and each morning would throw some fish to the eagles over the short driftwood fence she had made around her motorhome. By the end of that spring, a half-dozen eagles were showing up for breakfast. The eagles departed with the arrival of summer, when the Spit became more active with human visitors, but they returned in the winter when tourist season had ended, and Keene resumed the daily feeding.|$|E
