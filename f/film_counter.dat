40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} representations and metaphoric functions {{of food and}} eating {{in a wide range}} of European and American films. It purports to present an original approach to film historiography and to the study of film aesthetics. The first chapter, "Food and National Identity in the Cinema," addresses the specific case of food as a conveyor of national identity in French film. Analysis in this chapter is founded on recent critical debates on nationhood and national cinemas. The first part of the chapter examines French films of the pre-war period, whenu food and eating were especially used to convey consensus and harmony. The second part deals with the post-war period, when food started to clearly signify the deterioration of communal, familial and national structures and traditions. The second chapter, "Film, Food and the Feminine," traces mainstream and avant-garde representations of women as both cooks and eaters from the pre-feminist (i. e. up to about 1969 - 1970) to the post-feminist periods. Analysis is based on feminist cultural criticism of the contradictory messages sent to women about food and eating. Depictions in the pre-feminist period contained eating and cooking women within very limited and stereotypical cinematic spaces. The post-feminist period has seen a diversification of the possible ways of presenting women together with food, especially in films made by female directors. Chapter Three, "Alimentary Delinquency in the Cinema," deals with the distinctly post-classical phenomenon of films that feature acts of cannibalism, coprophagy and other aberrant eating practices. Eased on theories of the "carnivalesque" in film, the first part of the chapter offers an analysis of the specific areas of film production in which alimentary delinquency is prominent: the low forms of the horror <b>film,</b> <b>counter</b> cinema, and contemporary art films. The final section examines alimentary delinquency as a form of corporal spectacle which has the capacity to provoke physical reactions in the spectator's own body. The Conclusion considers recent international "food films" to see how they crystallise and amplify many of the issues raised in this study...|$|E
30|$|Currently, {{the solar}} cells {{available}} commercially {{are based on}} inorganic silicon semiconductors, made of p-n junctions, which are relatively expensive to manufacture and also the manufacturing process releases harmful emissions to the environment that cause pollution. Hence, hybrid solar cells appear to be highly promising and cost-effective alternatives for photovoltaic energy sectors due to its relatively cheapness to produce, and promising efficiency. In this regard, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been given considerable attention in recent years [1]. DSSC, which was invented by Michael Grätzel and Brian O’Regan in 1991, is a device that converts visible light energy into electrical energy based on the sensitization of the wide band gap semiconductors [2, 3] by suitable regenerative dyes. A DSSC consists of a porous wide band gap semiconductor thin film layer like (TiO 2, ZnO, SnO 2, Nb 2 O 5) coated on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) photoanode electrode, a dye, a platinum (Pt) or carbon or conductive polymer thin <b>film</b> <b>counter</b> electrode and an electrolyte normally containing I−/I 3 − redox couple. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) is most commonly used as photoanode in DSSC application since it is nontoxic, inert, and has a large energy bandgap as well as good optical and electrical properties and, thus, can be efficiently sensitized by a dye [4]. In DSSC, the dye {{plays an important role}} in harvesting solar energy and converting it to electrical energy with the aid of a semiconducting photoanode. Therefore, the cell performance is mainly dependent on the type of dye used as a sensitizer in which the absorption spectrum and the anchorage of the dye to the surface of TiO 2 are important parameters in determining the efficiency of the cell [5, 6]. Several metal complexes and organic dyes have been synthesized and used as sensitizers. Among these, ruthenium based complexes are considered as the most efficient sensitizers because of their intense charge -transfer absorption over the entire visible range and highly efficient metal-to-ligand charge transfer [2, 3, 7]. However, these advantages are offset by their rarity, high cost, complicated synthetic routes, and environmental threat. Thus, an alternative organic dye such as natural dyes is suggested with similar characteristic with an acceptable efficiency [8, 9, 10]. Recently, research has focused on the easily available dyes extracted from natural sources because of their large absorption coefficients, high light-harvesting efficiency, complete biodegradation, low cost, simple and safe preparation and eco-friendly. Thus far, several dyes such as anthocyanins, carotenoids, betalains and chlorophylls extracted from parts of different plants (such as Jathropha curcas, Citrus aurantium, red cabbage and etc.) have been used as sensitizers in DSSC [11, 12].|$|E
