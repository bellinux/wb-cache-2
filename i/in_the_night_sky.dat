5|$|The Sun has an {{apparent}} magnitude of −26.7, but its absolute magnitude is only +4.83.

Despite Canopus being vastly more luminous than Sirius, however, Sirius appears brighter than Canopus.

5|$|Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a {{duration}} {{called the}} synodic period.

5|$|Supernova SN 1054 {{was another}} widely {{observed}} event, with Arab, Chinese, and Japanese astronomers recording the star's appearance in 1054 CE. It {{may also have}} been recorded by the Anasazi as a petroglyph. This explosion appeared in the constellation of Taurus, where it produced the Crab Nebula remnant. At its peak, the luminosity of SN 1054 may have been four times as bright as Venus, and it remained visible in daylight for 23 days and was visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> for 653 days.|$|E
5|$|Vega, also {{designated}} Alpha Lyrae (α Lyrae, abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr), is {{the brightest}} star in the constellation of Lyra, the fifth-brightest star <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus.

5|$|Canis Major is a {{prominent}} constellation {{because of its}} many bright stars. These include Sirius (Alpha Canis Majoris), the brightest star <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky,</b> as well as three other stars above magnitude 2.0. Furthermore, two other stars {{are thought to have}} previously outshone all others in the night sky—Adhara (Epsilon Canis Majoris) shone at -3.99 around 4.7 million years ago, and Mirzam (Beta Canis Majoris) peaked at −3.65 around 4.42 million years ago. Another, NR Canis Majoris, will be brightest at magnitude −0.88 in about 2.87 million years' time.|$|E
5|$|Circinus X-1 is an X-ray {{binary star}} system that {{includes}} a neutron star. Observations of Circinus X-1 in July 2007 revealed the presence of X-ray jets normally found in black hole systems. Located at 19,000light-years, the pulsar PSR B1509-58, also called the Circinus Pulsar, has expelled a 20-light-year-long jet of material from its southern pole, clearly visible in the X-ray spectrum. Another supernova remnant in Circinus is that of SN 185. Recorded by Chinese observers in 185 AD, SN 185 was visible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky</b> for around eight months; its remnants, known as RCW 86, cover an area larger than the typical full moon.|$|E
5|$|Its {{brightest}} star, Capella, is {{an unusual}} multiple star system among the brightest stars <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>sky.</b> Beta Aurigae is an interesting variable star in the constellation; Epsilon Aurigae, a nearby eclipsing binary with an unusually long period, has been studied intensively. Because of its position near the winter Milky Way, Auriga has many bright open clusters in its borders, including M36, M37, and M38, popular targets for amateur astronomers. In addition, it has one prominent nebula, the Flaming Star Nebula, associated with the variable star AE Aurigae.|$|E
5000|$|On 14 May 1941 Pickard was {{assigned}} to 9 Squadron. He was joined there by Broadley, who by now had become a commissioned officer. The squadron was based at Honington, and flew the Wellington. Another grueling tour of operations followed. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>skies</b> over Germany <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1941 they flew against major German targets such as Hamburg, Düsseldorf and Cologne. [...] At the time, only about 30% of aircrews survived {{to the end of}} a 30 sortie tour of combat. By the end of August Pickard had flown another 33 sorties with Broadley, bringing his total to 64.

5000|$|Across the Nevada desert skies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, {{there were}} reports of strange lights <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>skies,</b> with some of these reports {{explained}} as possible UFOs.

The strange lights over the Nevada desert were officially recognized in November 1988 when the Department of Defense unveiled the F-117 Nighthawk stealth aircraft, an outgrowth of USAF's Have Blue reduced radar cross-section (RCS) research aircraft.
