40|$|I confront {{three models}} of the policy <b>impact</b> of social <b>movements</b> with data on the {{mobilization}} of ecology, antinuclear, and peace movements in the United States between 1975 and 1995 by means of time-series analysis: the direct-effect model, the indirect-effect model, and the joint- effect model. My analysis suggests that social movements have little, if any, impact on public policy and that, {{if they are to}} have an impact, it depends on the combination of overt protest activities, the type of issues they raise, and external resources such as public opinion and political alliances with institutional actors. Thus, it appears that, if they are to have a policy <b>impact,</b> <b>movements</b> need the joint occurence of mobilization, support from political allies, and public opinion favorable to the cause...|$|R
5000|$|In the Showdown Phase, {{the players}} face off against the monster {{in a manner}} typical of most {{tabletop}} role-playing games. Each monster has a unique deck of AI (artificial intelligence) and Hit Location cards; prior to showdown, players draw a select number of AI cards to create the deck for the monster for that showdown. The number of cards in the AI deck is generally equivalent to the monster's health; wounding the monster usually removes an AI card from this deck. Each Showdown also has the players populate the game board with terrain tiles that can <b>impact</b> <b>movement</b> or provide cover.|$|E
40|$|Maintaining {{ecological}} integrity necessitates {{a proactive}} approach of identifying and acquiring lands to conserve unfragmented landscapes, {{as well as}} evaluating existing mitigation strategies to increase connectivity in fragmented landscapes. The increased use of highway underpasses and overpasses to restore connectivity for wildlife species offers clear conservation benefits, yet also presents {{a unique opportunity to}} understand how weather conditions may <b>impact</b> <b>movement</b> of wildlife species. We used remote camera observations (19, 480) from an existing wildlife highway underpass in Wyoming and daily meteorological observations to quantify weather conditions associated with autumn migration of mule deer in 2009 and 2010. We identified minimal daily temperature and snow depth as proximate cues associated with mule deer migration to winter range. These weather cues were consistent across does and bucks, but differed slightly by year. Additionally, extreme early season snow depth or cold temperature events appear to be associated with onset of migration. This information will assist wildlife managers and transportation officials as they plan future projects to maintain and enhance migration routes for mule deer...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{aggregation}} devices (FADs) {{have been}} used extensively in the tuna purse seine fishery since the 1980 s. This long-term modification of natural habitat has generated discussions as to whether FADs <b>impact</b> <b>movement</b> patterns of tuna species. We examined this question using data collected from the skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) fishery. We used the longitudinal gravitational center of catch (G) to examine temporal variability in skipjack movement in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, and related this to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. We found that in most cases G for free-swimming school sets changed {{with the onset of}} ENSO events, while G for floating-object-associated school sets remained relatively constant. This suggests that skipjack exhibit distinguishable behavioral strategies in response to ENSO events: they either react by moving long distances or they associate with floating objects. There has been no previous attempt to evaluate the interaction between FADs and the environmentally-determined movement of skipjack; this study shows evidence of an interaction, which should be considered when managing skipjack populations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper investigates how the {{efficiency}} and robustness of a skilled rhythmic task compete {{against each other in}} the control of a bimanual movement. Human subjects juggled a puck in 2 D through impacts with two metallic arms, requiring rhythmic bimanual actuation. The arms kinematics were only constrained by the position, velocity and time of impacts {{while the rest of the}} trajectory did not influence the movement of the puck. In order to expose the task robustness, we manipulated the task context in two distinct manners: the task tempo was assigned at four different values (hence manipulating the time available to plan and execute each <b>impact</b> <b>movement</b> individually); and vision was withdrawn during half of the trials (hence reducing the sensory inflows). We show that when the tempo was fast, the actuation was rhythmic (no pause in the trajectory) while at slow tempo, the actuation was discrete (with pause intervals between individual movements). Moreover, the withdrawal of visual information encouraged the rhythmic behavior at the four tested tempi. The discrete versus rhythmic behavior give different answers to {{the efficiency}}/robustness trade-off: discrete movements result in energy efficient movements, while rhythmic movements impact the puck with negative acceleration, a property preserving robustness. Moreover, we report that in all conditions the impact velocity of the arms was negatively correlated with the energy of the puck. This correlation tended to stabilize the task and was influenced by vision, revealing again different control strategies. In conclusion, this task involves different modes of control that balance efficiency and robustness, depending on the context...|$|E
40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Skilled {{performance}} of reach actions includes both anticipatory planning and compensatory adjustments made while moving. The execution of reach actions {{in a virtual}} environment (VE) demonstrates similar characteristics to reaches performed in the real-world, however, {{it is unclear whether}} the VE itself significantly impacts movement planning or compensatory adjustments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to directly compare the use of planning and adjustments to control extent for unconstrained reach actions performed in an immersive VE to those performed in an analogous real-world environment (RWE). 				 				 					 						Methods 					Five non-disabled adults (29 &# 8201;&# 177;&# 8201; 5 &# 160;years) reached with the dominant, right arm to six targets presented in two directions (+ 45 &# 176;, - 45 &# 176;) and three distances (8, 16, 24 &# 160;cm) in a VE and an analogous RWE. Position data were sampled at 120 &# 160;Hz from an electromagnetic marker on the index finger and differentiated to determine velocity and acceleration. The control of reach extent was compared between the two environments (paired t-test) as to the use of planning (correlation of peak acceleration with movement distance), compensatory adjustments prior to peak velocity (correlation of time to peak velocity with movement distance), and compensatory adjustments after peak velocity (variance in movement distance accounted for by deterministic statistical model). 				 				 					 						Results 					Reach movements were relatively fast ( 92 % of the variance in movement distance across participants and environments. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					The VE did not <b>impact</b> <b>movement</b> planning or subsequent compensatory adjustments for the control of reach extent when directly compared to an analogous RWE. An immersive VE is a valid environment for the study of unconstrained reach actions...|$|E
