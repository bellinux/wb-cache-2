5|$|MacFarlane {{developed}} a Family Guy spin-off called The Cleveland Show, {{which focuses on}} the character of Cleveland Brown and his family. The idea for the show originated from a suggestion by Family Guy writer and voice of Cleveland, Mike Henry. Fox ordered 22 episodes and the series first aired on September 27, 2009. The show, which was picked up to air a first season consisting of 22 episodes, was picked up by Fox for a second season, consisting of 13 episodes, bringing the total number to 35 episodes. The announcement was made on May 3, 2009 before the first season even premiered. Due to strong ratings, Fox picked up the back nine episodes of season 2, making a 22-episode season and bringing the total episode count of the show to 44. The series ended on May 19, 2013, with a total of 4 seasons and 88 episodes, and the character of Cleveland returned to Family <b>Guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode He's Bla-ack!. This is the only animated series created by MacFarlane that does not have him voicing the main character.|$|E

25|$|Wolf {{took the}} idea to then-president of Universal Television Kerry McCluggage, who pointed out the {{similarity}} to a 1963 series titled Arrest and Trial, which lasted one season. The two watched the pilot of that series, in which a police officer (Ben Gazzara) arrested a man for armed robbery in the first half, and the defense attorney, played by Chuck Connors gets the perpetrator off as the wrong <b>guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half; this was the formula of the show every week. Wolf decided that, while his detectives would occasionally also be fallible, he wanted a fresh approach to the genre, to go from police procedural to prosecution with {{a greater degree of}} realism. In addition, the prosecution would be the hero, a reversal of the usual formula in lawyer dramas.|$|E
25|$|When Capcom {{produced}} the original Street Fighter Alpha in 1995, Guy {{would be one}} of two Final Fight characters {{to be included in the}} game along with the game's second stage boss Sodom. According to Tatsuya Minami, senior manager of Capcom's Product Planning and Design section, Capcom included <b>Guy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game because he was extremely popular and easy to translate to the one-on-one fighting genre. In this game, Guy's character design was altered slightly, with his jika-tabi replaced by sneakers (a change that was retained when Guy was brought back into the Final Fight series in Final Fight 3), although his fighting style mimics that of his Final Fight counterpart. Guy and Sodom would be joined by Rolento in 1996's Street Fighter Alpha 2 and by Cody in 1998's Street Fighter Alpha 3, followed by Maki's appearance in the portable versions of Alpha 3. Guy's new design would be used in the second Final Fight sequel for the SNES, Final Fight 3 and along with Cody's Street Fighter Alpha rendition, are also hidden characters in Final Fight One (Final Fight for the Game Boy). In the Alpha games, Guy's Bushin predecessor is revealed to be a man named Zeku, who would appear in Guy's ending in Street Fighter Alpha 2 to test Guy for his successor-ship. Zeku's presence in the game contradicts Final Fight 2, which identifies Genryusai as Guy's sensei, as designers of the Alpha games did not take into account the SNES Final Fight sequels when developing the games. Zeku was mentioned once again in Guy's bio in Street Fighter Alpha 3.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the title}} of the episode is a {{reference}} to the 1969 Disney film The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, the episode itself has [...] "essentially nothing" [...] to do with the film, according to M.
