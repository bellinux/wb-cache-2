2500|$|Diesel fuel [...] {{in general}} is any liquid fuel used in diesel engines, whose fuel {{ignition}} takes place, without any spark, {{as a result of}} compression of the inlet air mixture and then <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel.</b> (Glow plugs, grid heaters and block heaters help achieve high temperatures for combustion during engine startup in cold weather.) Diesel engines have found broad use as a result of higher thermodynamic efficiency and thus fuel efficiency. This is particularly noted where diesel engines are run at part-load; as their air supply is not throttled as in a petrol engine, their efficiency still remains very high.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power stroke}} begins at TDC (0°; <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> leads TDC by 4° 356°, such that <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> will be {{completed}} by TDC or very shortly thereafter; the fuel ignites {{as fast as it}} is injected), after the power stroke the exhaust valves are opened, thereby greatly reducing combustion gas pressure and temperature, and preparing the cylinder for scavenging, for a power stroke duration of 103°.|$|E

40|$|The use <b>of</b> {{close-coupled}} post <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> is an in-cylinder soot-reduction {{technique that}} has much promise for high efficiency, heavy-duty diesel engines. Close-coupled post <b>injections,</b> short <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> that occur {{soon after the}} end <b>of</b> the main <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> {{have been known to}} reduce engine-out soot at a wide range of engine operating conditions, including variations in injection timing, EGR level, load, boost, and speed. While many studies have investigated the performance <b>of</b> post <b>injections,</b> the details <b>of</b> the mechanism by which soot is reduced remains unclear. In this study, we have measured the efficacy <b>of</b> post <b>injections</b> over a range of load conditions, at constant speed, boost, and rail pressure, in a heavy-duty, optically-accessible research diesel engine. Here, the base load is varied by changing the main-injection duration. Measurements of engine-out soot indicate that not only does the efficacy <b>of</b> a post <b>injection</b> decrease at higher engine loads, but that the range of post-injection durations over which soot reduction is achievable is limited at higher loads. Optical measurements, including natural luminescence of soot and planar laser-induced incandescence of soot, provide information about the spatio-temporal development of in-cylinder soot through the cycle in cases with and without post injections. The optical results indicate that the post injection behaves similarly at different loads, but that its relative efficacy decreases due to the increase in soot resulting from longer main-injection durations.

40|$|A {{feedback}} control strategy {{is applied to}} enhance {{the performance of a}} laboratory-scale pulsed combustor operating near the lower flammability limit. As with many combustion processes, at lean conditions, combustion instabilities develop which result in complex, lowfrequency fluctuations in fuel concentration and lead directly to misfire and flameout. The control strategy exploits the highly nonlinear relationship between equivalence ratio and reaction rate at lean operating conditions to dampen the instabilities via high-speed <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> supplemental <b>fuel.</b> Timing <b>of</b> the control perturbations is determined by monitoring the combustor pressure for characteristic mediating trajectories which lead to misfire. The nonlinear nature of the system allows combustion stabilization to be achieved with relatively small <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> supplemental <b>fuel.</b> The control scheme is shown to be effective in reducing unburnedhydrocarbon emission levels and extending the practical operating limit of the pulsed combustor towards the lower flammability limit...|$|R
40|$|The {{combustion}} process, soot {{formation and}} oxidation in spark ignited, spray guided, globally lean, stratified combustion of E 10 and E 85 was investigated and compared {{in a single}} cylinder optical engine with an outward opening piezo actuated injector. Two engine loads and several injection sequences were studied. Cylinder pressure measurements, high speed video recordings, OH* chemiluminescence and soot incandescence imaging were used. Stable ignition and combustion <b>of</b> both <b>fuels</b> was achieved with a spark {{at the end of}} the last the fuel spray for all injection strategy cases except for the single <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> large <b>fuel</b> quantities. The average rate of heat release and work output increased and the work variability decreased for both <b>fuels</b> with multiple <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> for both engine loads. The changes for each case and variable were approximately equal for the two <b>fuels.</b> Single <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> E 85 led to pool fires on the piston surface which were the only source of soot formation. Pool fires persisted after the end of conditions favourable to soot oxidation. For E 10 the source of soot formation was a combination of pool fires and gas phase soot formation at 3. 6 bar while at 5 bar pool fires were the only source. Two injections led to a significant reduction of the soot formation for both fuels and both engine loads. Pool fires remained the sole source of soot formation for E 85 while the gas phase was the primary source for E 10 and largely ceased during the combustion process while soot oxidizing conditions were present. The spatial distribution of combustion was remarkably similar for both fuels when multiple injections were used...|$|R

50|$|Herbert Akroyd Stuart was {{a pioneer}} in {{developing}} compression ignition aided by retained heat of combustion in the bulb, Rudolf Diesel however, was subsequently credited with the true compression ignition engine relying solely on heat of compression and not {{any other form of}} retained heat. Higher compression and thermal efficiency along with <b>injection</b> timing <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> and vaporization <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> through <b>injection</b> system and not by heated surface is what distinguishes Diesel's patent of 3,500 kilopascals (508 psi).|$|R
5000|$|Tanks {{and naval}} ships {{may use the}} <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> or special [...] "fog oil" [...] into exhaust tract to create smoke screens.

50|$|A {{spark-ignition}} engine is an internal combustion engine, generally a petrol engine, where the combustion {{process of the}} air-fuel mixture is ignited by a spark from a spark plug. This {{is in contrast to}} compression-ignition engines, typically diesel engines, where the heat generated from compression together with the <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> is enough to initiate the combustion process, without needing any external spark.|$|E
50|$|In the single-piston designs, {{the engine}} captures the heat lost from the {{four-stroke}} Otto cycle or Diesel cycle and {{uses it to}} drive an additional power and exhaust stroke of the piston in the same cylinder {{in an attempt to}} improve fuel-efficiency and/or assist with engine cooling. The pistons in this type of six-stroke engine go up and down three times for each <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel.</b> These designs use either steam or air as the working fluid for the additional power stroke.|$|E
40|$|The power generation, used {{to promote}} comfort, {{mobility}} and others continually grows. To solve this growing demand, efforts have been directed towards {{the development of new}} energy sources, preferably renewable, and better ways of energy conversion by increasing the processes efficiencies. A good example of this is the gradual shift from conventional and highly inefficient vehicles, being replaced by hybrids or purely electrics. But even with gradual migration for more efficient energy use, we will continue depending <b>of</b> traditional <b>fuels</b> therefore it is necessary to develop more efficient and less polluting ways to use these sources. Thus, this work aims to study alternative ways of converting energy contained in fuels used in internal combustion engines by use of combustion mode RCCI, two fluids with different cetane numbers are introduced into the combustion chamber at different times with the purpose <b>of</b> burning the <b>fuel</b> with lower cetane number. Therefore, for combustion mode RCCI, the SOI <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> with lower enthalpy of vaporization and the start of combustion must be determined to determine the ignition delay.

50|$|Another way {{to offer}} start/stop is by {{employing}} a static start engine. Such an engine requires no starter motor, but employs sensors {{to determine the}} exact position of each piston, then precisely timing the <b>injection</b> and ignition <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> {{to turn over the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|Intercoolers also {{eliminate}} the need for using the wasteful method of lowering intake charge temperature by the <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> excess <b>fuel</b> into the cylinders' air induction chambers, to cool the intake air charge, prior to its flowing into the cylinders. This wasteful practice (before intercoolers were used) nearly eliminated the gain in engine efficiency from forced induction, but was necessitated by the greater need to prevent at all costs the engine damage that pre-detonation engine knocking causes.|$|R

5000|$|In this stage, {{the mixture}} (in {{the case of}} an Otto engine) or air (in the case of a Diesel engine) is {{compressed}} {{to the top of the}} cylinder by the piston until it is either ignited by a spark plug in an Otto engine or, in the case of a Diesel engine, by the fuel being injected into the compressed (and thereby heated) air, forcing the piston back down. In a Diesel engine, the <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> usually leads top dead center by about 4 mechanical degrees, this [...] "lead" [...] being intended to allow complete fuel ignition to occur slightly after top dead center.|$|E
50|$|A Hesselman {{engine is}} {{basically}} a spark-ignition engine, converted to run on heavier petroleum products such as oil, kerosene or diesel oil. The fuel is injected into the combustion chamber using an injection pump. Because of the engine's low compression the fuel must be ignited by a spark plug, unlike the diesel engine, where the fuel ignites spontaneously by the heat generated by the high compression ratio. Hesselman engines were often started on gasoline and then switched to diesel or kerosene when at working temperature. Clearing the heavy oil for the next start was achieved by switching back to gasoline before stopping. It is the first spark ignition engine for automotive use with direct <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> into the cylinder.|$|E

30|$|Other {{important}} observation was {{an increase}} in the hydrogen generation rate upon parallel increases in fuel concentration and feeding rate. This phenomenon has also been observed by Kim et al. [3] up to such extent after which a decrease was denoted in the hydrogen generation rate and interpreted due to a shortage in the contact time with the catalyst. Other researchers Subramanian and Javed [18] and Kim et al. [3] applied controlled <b>injections</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> solution into the hydrogen generator via syringe and piezoelectric pumps, respectively, and indicated that better hydrogen generation control was achieved. This clearly illustrates that hydrogen production from NaBH 4 using HCl accelerator is highly controllable. Thereby, any desired hydrogen generation rate could be obtained by increasing or decreasing solution flow rates. This identity is so beneficial for onboard fuel cell system applications and ultimately the abovementioned results indicate that a possible amelioration in the hydrogen generation rate could be achieved by applying higher NaBH 4 concentrations and using the proposed scheme as compared with the data reported in the literature obtained via catalytic scheme.|$|R
50|$|The Bajulaz six-stroke {{engine is}} similar to a regular {{combustion}} engine in design. There are, however, modifications to the cylinder head, with two supplementary fixed-capacity chambers: a combustion chamber and an air-preheating chamber above each cylinder. The combustion chamber receives a charge of heated air from the cylinder; the <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> begins an isochoric (constant-volume) burn, which increases the thermal efficiency compared to a burn in the cylinder. The high pressure achieved is then released into the cylinder to work the power or expansion stroke. Meanwhile, a second chamber, which blankets the combustion chamber, has its air content heated to a high degree by heat passing through the cylinder wall. This heated and pressurized air is then used to power an additional stroke of the piston.|$|E

5000|$|Herbert Akroyd Stuart {{was always}} keen {{to improve the}} {{efficiency}} of his engine. The obvious {{way to do this}} was to raise the compression ratio to increase the engine's thermal efficiency. However, above ratios of around 8:1 the fuel oil in the vaporiser would ignite before the piston reached the limit of its travel. This pre-ignition caused rough running, power loss and ultimately engine damage. (See engine knocking.) Working with engineers at Hornsby's, Akroyd Stuart developed a system whereby the compression ratio was increased to as much as 18:1 and fuel oil was delivered to the cylinder only when the piston reached top dead centre, thus preventing pre-ignition. However it was patented through US Patent 845140 Combustion Engine, dated February 26, 1907, so such an innovation is attributed to Rudolph Diesel who originally patented the <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> just before end of compression stroke. And the water jacketed vaporizer only slightly alleviated auto-ignition and contributed to heat transfer losses to water decreasing the efficiency of engine.|$|E
50|$|A {{glowplug}} (alternatively spelled as {{glow plug}} or glow-plug) is a heating device used to aid starting diesel engines. In cold weather, {{high speed diesel}} engines {{can be difficult to}} start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition (which relies on that heat). Pre-chambered engines use small electric heaters (glowplugs) inside the pre-chambers. Direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber. The glowplug is a pencil-shaped piece of metal with a heating element at the tip. This heating element, when electrified, heats due to its electrical resistance and begins to emit light in the visible spectrum, hence the term glowplug. The visual effect is similar to the heating element in a toaster. The fuel injector spray pattern then impinges directly upon the hot tip of the glow plug during the <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> at top dead center. This ignites the fuel even when the engine is insufficiently hot for normal operation, which reduces the cranking time to start the engine.|$|E

In this work, an experimental and computational {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effects of physical and chemical kinetic properties <b>of</b> low octane <b>fuels</b> and their surrogates in partially premixed compression ignition (PPCI) engines. The main objective was to identify the relative importance of physical versus chemical kinetic properties in predicting practical fuel combustion behavior across a range <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> timings. Two fuel/surrogate pairs were chosen for comparison: light naphtha (LN) versus the primary reference fuel (PRF) with research octane number of 65 (PRF 65), and FACE (fuels for advanced combustion engines) I gasoline versus PRF 70. Two sets of parametric studies were conducted: the first varied the amount <b>of</b> injected <b>fuel</b> mass at different injection timings to match a fixed combustion phasing, and the second maintained the same injected fuel mass at each injection timing to assess resulting combustion phasing changes. Full-cycle computational fluid dynamic engine simulations were conducted by accounting for differences in the physical properties of the original and surrogate fuels, while employing identical chemical kinetics. The simulations were found to capture trends observed in the experiments, while providing details on spatial mixing and chemical reactivity for different fuels and injection timings. It was found that differences in physical properties become increasingly important as injection timing was progressively delayed from premixed conditions, and this was rationalized by analysis of mixture stratification patterns resulting from <b>injection</b> <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> with different physical properties. The results suggest that accurate descriptions of both physical and chemical behavior <b>of</b> <b>fuels</b> are critical in predictive simulations of PPCI engines for a wide range <b>of</b> <b>injection</b> timings...|$|R
