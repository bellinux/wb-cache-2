5|$|On May 30, 1930, Bacher married Jean Dow. His {{mother gave}} them a Ford Model A {{and the use of}} the family's lakeside <b>holiday</b> <b>house,</b> where they entertained guests {{including}} Paul Ehrenfest and Enrico Fermi. In 1931, with a National Research Council Fellowship, he spent a year at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) because Ira Bowen taught there. At Caltech Bacher attended lectures by Robert Oppenheimer, but spent most of his time at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, which had a better library. Bacher decided to create a work listing the energy, coupling constant, parity and electron configurations of all the known atoms and ions, working with Goudsmit back in Ann Arbor. The result was a book, Atomic Energy States as Derived from the Analysis of Optical Spectra (1932), which they dedicated to Randall.|$|E

2500|$|Faulkner married Lucy Forsythe, a {{graduate}} of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1951. They met through their common interests in politics and hunting. She was equally suited to a political partnership having had a career in journalism with the Belfast Telegraph and was secretary to the Northern Ireland Prime Minister, Sir Basil Brooke, when they met. Together they had three children: a daughter and two sons. They took up residence at Highlands, {{not far from the}} village of Seaforde.

2500|$|Going {{into the}} 1980s, fashion—British fashion in particular—turned towards the new punk rock craze. Clothing from Vivienne Westwood's {{shop on the}} King's Road became the most popular look and one of Malcolm McLaren's [...] "Scum" [...] T-shirt text {{went so far as}} to include Ossie Clark under the heading [...] "Hates". Clark's romantic flowing gowns were no longer in fashion. His {{fortunes}} declined to bankruptcy and he largely stopped working commercially. Famously devoid of business acumen, he blamed his downfall on banks and the taxman's ruthless insistence on cashing in all his assets. His bitterness at this and a short-sighted determination to sit out the bankruptcy term, along with deep depression, meant he worked only on private commissions that were paid for by barter. A loyal band of famous clients and friends would order a dress and pay for it by loaning a <b>holiday</b> <b>house</b> in the Caribbean or paying for his sewing machine to be repaired.|$|E

60|$|I had an {{invitation}} to spend the Christmas of that year with the Collingwoods, who had opened their country house, about twelve miles from Warburton, for the entertainment of a <b>holiday</b> <b>house</b> party.

60|$|Miss Arthuret and Elizabeth Merrifield had {{arranged}} together {{to take the}} old roomy farmhouse on Penbeacon {{for three or four}} months, and there receive parties of young women in need of rest, fresh air, and, in some cases, of classes, or time for study. It was to be a sort of <b>Holiday</b> <b>House,</b> though not altogether of idleness; and Dolores undertook {{to be a kind of}} vice-president, with Agatha to pursue her reading under her superintendence, and to assist in helping others, governesses, students, schoolmistresses from Coalham, in whose behalf indeed the scheme had been first started, and it was extremely delightful to Agatha, among many others.|$|E
60|$|In truth, Dermot did {{not keep}} that {{reputation}} much longer than his petticoats. Ere long he was a pickle of the first order, equalling the sublime naughtiness of <b>Holiday</b> <b>House,</b> and was continually being sent home by private tutors, who could not manage him. All the time I had a secret conviction that, {{if he had been}} my own mother's son, she could have managed him, and he would never have even wished to do what she disapproved; but Lady Diana had no sympathy or warmth in her, and while she loved her children she fretted them, and never thawed nor unbent; and when she called in her brother's support, Dermot's nerves were driven frantic by the long harangues, and his relief was in antics which of course redoubled his offence. After he had put crackers into his uncle's boots, peppered the coachman's wig, inserted a live toad in the centre of a fortification of clear jelly at a great luncheon, and had one Christmas painted the two stone wild boars that guard the iron gates of Erymanth Castle into startling resemblance of the porkers as displayed in butchers' shops, with a little tin pail at the snout of each, labelling each sevenpence-ha'penny per pound, his uncle had little more hope of him.|$|E
