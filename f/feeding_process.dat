25|$|Dogs {{and cats}} on the East Coast of Australia {{commonly}} {{succumb to the}} tick paralysis caused by Ixodes holocyclus. A similar tick species, Ixodes cornuatus, appears to cause paralysis in Tasmania. The paralyzing toxin (or toxins) is produced in the salivary glands and injected {{as part of the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
25|$|B. burgdorferi is {{injected}} into the skin by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the <b>feeding</b> <b>process,</b> contains substances that disrupt the immune response {{at the site of}} the bite. This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish infection. The spirochetes multiply and migrate outward within the dermis. The host inflammatory response to the bacteria in the skin causes the characteristic circular EM lesion. Neutrophils, however, which are necessary to eliminate the spirochetes from the skin, fail to appear in the developing EM lesion. This allows the bacteria to survive and eventually spread throughout the body.|$|E
25|$|The adult female tick {{is usually}} {{attached}} {{for a minimum}} of 3 days before the very earliest signs are noticed although a very observant person might begin to notice a slight change in behavior after 48 hrs of attachment (in a warm climate). Typically, however, a person would not notice obvious signs until at least the 4th day of attachment. In colder weather the <b>feeding</b> <b>process</b> is slowed down considerably and some animals may not show significant signs of paralysis for as long as two weeks. Furthermore, dogs rarely show significant signs until the adult female has engorged to a width of at least 4mm (measured {{at the level of the}} spiracles, see photo of lateral view of Ixodes holocyclus).|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} the use of cobalt-mediated catalytic chain transfer in aqueous solution under fed conditions for the preparation of macromonomers of acidic, hydroxy, and zwitterionic functional monomers. Use of a batch reaction leads to hydrolysis of catalyst, a mixture of mechanisms and poor control of the reaction. A <b>feed</b> <b>process</b> is described that adds catalyst as a solution in monomer {{over the course of}} the reaction. The <b>feed</b> <b>process</b> is applied to a range of monomers of methacrylic acid (2), 2 -aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (3), 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (4), 2 -methacryloxyethyl phosphoryl choline (5), glycerol monomethyl methacrylate (6), and 3 -O-methacryloyl- 1, 2 : 5, 6 -di-O-isopropylidene-D-glucofuranose (7). Use of the <b>feed</b> <b>process</b> for water-soluble monomers in conjunction with 1 as a catalytic chain-transfer agent gives high-conversion, > 90 %, water-soluble macromonomers. The number-average molecular mass M-n was determined by integration of the H- 1 NMR spectrum comparing the vinylic end group with the remainder of the backbone. Pseudo-Mayo plots were constructed by measuring the M, at high conversion as a function of [monomer]/[catalyst] to give observed chain-transfer constants of 1120, 958, and 1058 for 4, 6, and 2, respectively.

25|$|The feeding {{was done}} {{through the use}} of specially-constructed small wooden boxes, 4cm by 7cm, {{developed}} by Weigl. The boxes were sealed with paraffin on the top which prevented the lice from escaping, and the underside consisted of a screen made of a fabric sieve, adopted by Weigl from sieves that were used by local peasants to separate wheat husks from the seeds. A typical box contained 400 to 800 lice larvae which would mature as the feeding took place. The sieve bottom allowed the lice to stick out their heads and feed on the human flesh. A standard feeding period took thirty to forty-five minutes, and was repeated with the same lice colony for twelve days. Usually, an individual feeder would accommodate from 7 to 11 boxes (of 400 to 800 lice each) on his or her leg, per feeding session. Typically men would place the boxes on their calves, to minimize the discomfort of the bites, while women feeders placed them on their thighs, so that the bite marks could be covered up by a skirt. A nurse had to watch over the <b>feeding</b> <b>process</b> as the lice would feed beyond the point of being gorged on the blood and could burst if left on the human flesh for too long.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the force}} <b>feeding</b> <b>process,</b> the EU {{committee}} examined several experiments {{carried out by}} INRA (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique) to detect pain or distress by looking at blood hormones, and found that no definite conclusions {{can be drawn from}} these studies. Other studies looked at behavioral aversion to the <b>feeding</b> <b>process</b> and found that force fed ducks avoided the feeding pen when given a choice, whereas a majority of the control group not being force fed would enter the feeding pen voluntarily. Daily hand-feeding of ducks and geese is normally associated with a positive response by the animals towards the person feeding them. In contrast, the working group observed that ducks and geese in a pen kept away from their force feeder when he entered the room. In an unpublished pilot experiment by INRA, ducks in cages reportedly displayed less avoidance behaviour to the force feeder’s visit than to the visit of a neutral person coming along the cages later. However, in the working group's own observations, [...] "Ducks in cages had little opportunity to show avoidance but sometimes moved their heads away from the person who was about to force feed them." ...|$|E

5000|$|One of the {{purposes}} of the 1924 agreement between Hartford and Owens, the court found, [...] "was the elimination of competition between the gob <b>feed</b> <b>process</b> and the suction process." [...] There was no doubt, the court said, [...] "that one of the primary purposes in entering into the agreement was to divide the industry into two branches, to wit, suction, to be controlled by Owens, and gob feed, to be controlled by Hartford. Furthermore, {{as a result of the}} elimination of competition in the gob <b>feed</b> <b>process,</b> the industry could be stabilized. It would, of course, be futile to eliminate competition in the gob <b>feed</b> <b>process</b> if competition between the suction and gob processes was to continue." [...] A Hartford internal memorandum said: [...] " [...] H-F. shall restrict the issuance of further licenses in the container field in such manner [...] [...] [...] as shall preserve the general principle of preventing over plant-investment and over-production, as well as keeping the licenses out of the hands of objectionable and irresponsible parties. In like manner, Owens shall restrict the licensing of its suction feed and all developments thereof in such a way as to maintain a similar position." [...] Another Hartford memorandum said that [...] "this arrangement will practically divide the industry, so far as our two companies are concerned, into two branches—the suction process branch controlled by Owens and the gob feed branch controlled by H-F." [...] Given these and similar documents, the court said, it was not necessary for it [...] "to resort to inferences" [...] to ascertain the defendants' monopolistic intent.|$|R
50|$|Fish {{farming is}} the process of growing fish in an {{artificial}} environment. The traditional method involves feeding fish waste vegetables, and this is being done in developing countries. Modern fish farming involves <b>feeding</b> <b>processed</b> small wild fish to large carnivorous fish such as salmon, trout, and prawns.

2500|$|One of the {{interesting}} aspects of snake skin are folds of intersquamous skin between longitudinally oriented scale rows. The function of these folds is to permit the circumference of the snake to increase, allowing prey to pass into the stomach during feeling. Snakes differ from eels in {{the direction in which}} the skin is stiffer, the dorsal scale rows are more flexible in snake than in eels because the dorsal scale row associated with stretching. Differences in the local dermal structures, such as variations in the diameters and orientation of collagen fibers within the intersquamous skin create [...] local differences in the mechanical properties of the snake skin, thus allowing it to adapt to the stresses and strains during the <b>feeding</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Once {{in the gut}} A. caninum {{attaches}} to and ingests the mucosal lining along with some consumption of blood; up to 0.1mL in 24hrs. [...] In a 24hr period A. caninum typically feeds from six sites. [...] This damage to the mucosa compromises the body’s defences and can result in secondary infections by microbes. [...] A group of anticoagulant proteins called AcAPs (A. caninum anticoagulant proteins) which inhibit a range of blood coagulation factors such as Xa are utilised by A. caninum {{to help in the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>process</b> by preventing clotting and increasing blood loss. [...] These AcAPs are among the most powerful natural anticoagulants that exist and are a key reason for anemia being caused and blood being observed in the faeces of infected hosts. [...] Blood losses peak just prior to egg production by the females because this is when their requirements for food are greatest; the amount that they are eating is also peaking and so maximal damage to the intestine is being caused.|$|E
2500|$|Female {{mosquitoes}} use {{two very}} different food sources. They need sugar for energy, which is taken from sources such as nectar, and they need blood {{as a source of}} protein for egg development. Because biting is risky and suitable hosts may be difficult to find, mosquitoes take as much blood as possible when they have the opportunity. Digesting large volumes of blood takes time, requiring the use of energy from sugars during the <b>feeding</b> <b>process.</b> To avoid this problem, mosquitoes possess a digestive system which can store both food types, giving access to both as needed. When the mosquito drinks a sugar solution, it is directed to a crop. The crop can release sugar into the stomach as it is required. At the same time, the stomach never becomes full of sugar solution, which would prevent the mosquito taking a blood meal. Blood is directed straight into the mosquito's stomach. In species that feed on mammalian or avian blood, hosts whose blood pressure is high, the mosquito feeds selectively from active blood vessels, where the pressure assists in filling the gut rapidly.|$|E

2500|$|Ticks {{generally}} are obligate blood feeders. All active stages (larvae, nymphs and adults) require blood {{as a source}} of nutrition (except for a few Argasid genera in which the adult mouthparts are non-functional, i.e. Antricola, Otobius and Nothoaspis). Adults also require the blood for sperm or egg production. The <b>feeding</b> <b>process</b> of Ixodid ticks has first a slow phase for several days followed by a fast phase in the last 12–24 hours before detachment. There may be a tenfold increase in fed: unfed weights {{by the end of the}} slow phase, but there is an additional tenfold increase by the end of the final fast phase. Leaving the full engorgement as late as possible reduces the chances of detection and removal by the host. The process of feeding is called engorging. The hypostome has a groove along its dorsal surface forming a food canal (also known as the preoral canal) through which blood is drawn from the host and passed on to the mouth and pharynx. During blood feeding by Ixodid ticks, the liquid portion of the meal is first concentrated by removal of water and excess ions, which move across the gut epithelium and enter the ticks body cavity (hemocoele). These components are then taken up by the salivary glands which produce a watery saliva that is injected back into the host ...|$|E

Laser or electron beam spot size is an important input parameter that can affect {{the size and shape of}} a melt pool, and has a direct influence on the formation of lack-of-fusion and keyholing porosity. In this work, models are developed to gain a better understanding of the effects of spot size across different alloys and processes. Models are validated through experiments that also span multiple processes and alloys. Methods to expand the usable processing space are demonstrated in the ProX 200 laser powder bed fusion process. In depth knowledge of process parameters can reduce the occurrence of porosity and flaws throughout processing space and allow for the increased use of non-standard parameter sets. Knowledge of the effects of spot size and other process parameters can enable an operator to expand the usable processing space while avoiding the formation of some types of flaws.
