40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn {{response}} to inherent inadequacies in health information technologies, clinicians {{create their own}} tools for managing their information needs. Little is known about these clinician-designed information tools. With greater appreciation for why clinicians resort to these tools, health information technology designers can develop systems that better meet clinicians’ needs and that can also support clinicians in design and use of their own information tools. ObjectiveTo describe the design characteristics and use of a clinician-designed information tool in supporting information transfer and care coordinationDesignObservations, semi-structured interviews, and photographing were used to collect data. Participants were six nurse coordinators in a high-volume trauma hospital. Content analysis was carried out and interactions with information tools were analyzed. ResultsNurse coordinators used a paper-based information tool (a nurse coordinator’s clipboard) that consisted of the compilation of essential data from disparate information sources. The tool was assembled twice daily through (1) selecting and <b>formatting</b> <b>key</b> data from multiple information systems (such as the unit census and the EHR), (2) data reduction (e. g., by cutting and whitening out non-essential items from the print-outs of computerized information systems), (3) bundling (e. g., organizing pieces of information and taping them to each other), and (4) annotating (e. g., {{through the use of}} colored highlighters and shorthand symbols). It took nurse coordinators an average of 41 min to assemble the clipboard. The design goals articulated by nurse coordinators to fit the tool into their tasks included (1) making information compatible with the mobile nature of their work, (2) enabling rapid information access and note-taking under time pressure, and (3) supporting rapid information processing and attention management through the effective use of layout design, shorthand symbols, and color-coding. ConclusionsClinicians design their own information tools based on the existing health information technologies to meet their information needs. The characteristics of these clinician-designed tools provide insights into the “realities” of how clinicians work with health information technologies. The findings suggest an often overlooked role for health information technologies: facilitating user creation of information tools that will best meet their needs...|$|E

40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{addressed a}} {{controversy in the}} probability judgment literature that centers on the efficacy of framing probabilities as frequencies. The natural frequency view predicts that frequency formats attenuate errors, while the nested-sets view predicts that highlighting the set-subset structure of the problem reduces error, regardless of problem format. This study tested these predictions using a conjunction task. Previous studies reporting that frequency formats reduced conjunction errors confounded reference class with problem format. After controlling this confound, the present study’s findings show that conjunction errors can be reduced using either a probability or a frequency format, that frequency effects depend upon {{the presence of a}} reference class, and that frequency formats do not promote better statistical reasoning than probability <b>formats.</b> <b>Key</b> words: probability judgment, nested-sets, conjunction fallacy, frequency format, probability format. ...|$|R

Small groups of students (3 - 4 per group) choose a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) or an oncogene for this project.

Based on the promoter sequences, students design appropriate primers for the PCR amplification and cloning of the promoter of the gene of interest and perform a diagnostic digest to confirm the results. Finally, each student writes an individual report {{about his or her}} findings and results and each group presents the results to the class.
