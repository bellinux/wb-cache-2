5000|$|Activation and {{recruitment}} of DNA Ligase I {{seem to be}} associated with posttranslational modifications. N-terminal domain is completed through phosphorylation of four serine residues on this domain, Ser51, Ser76, and Ser91 by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) and Ser66 by casein kinase II (CKII). Phosphorylation of these residues (Ser66 in particular) has been shown to possibly regulate the interaction between the RFTS to the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) when Ligase I is recruited to the replication factories during S-phase. Rossi et al. proposed that when Ser66 is dephosphorylated, the RFTS of Ligase I interact with PCNA, which was confirmed in vitro by Tom et al. Both data sets provide plausible evidence the N-terminal region of Ligase <b>I</b> <b>plays</b> a regulatory role in the enzymes in vivo function in the nucleus. [...] Moreover, the identification of a cyclin binding (Cy) motif in the catalytic C-terminus domain was shown by mutational analysis {{to play a role in}} the phosphorylation of serines 91 and 76. Together, the N-terminal serines are substrates of the CDK and CKII, which appear to play an important regulatory role DNA ligase I recruitment to the replication factory during S-phase of the cell cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} for the PlayStation 2, and the second installment in the series. The subtitle Jenseits von Gut und Böse translates to [...] "Beyond Good and Evil", and is taken directly from {{the title of a}} book by Friedrich Nietzsche. Episode II continues the storyline started in Episode I but focuses more on the character Jr. The backstories and significance of Albedo, Gaignun, and Jr. are developed. Multiple organizations are uncovered, including Ormus and Hyams. The Gnosis take a back seat for Episode II and instead, the main plot focuses on the search for the Zohar, which culminates in a crisis at the location of Old Miltia. The cast from Episode <b>I</b> <b>plays</b> {{an important role in the}} events that transpire on Old Miltia. Although there are several loose ends and characters unaccounted for in Episode II, it concludes without a sudden cliffhanger. This is underscored by the fact that Episode III will take place a full year later. Episode II changes some of Episode Is elements, including different graphics, a modified battle system, new music composers, and shorter cutscenes. These changes led to mixed reviews from critics. Moreover, after the release of Episode II, several Monolith Soft employees were removed from the project.|$|E
5000|$|In the conclusion, Mazur {{provides}} a window onto {{the value of}} mathematics for human endeavour: The number i = √-1 is identified with the point whose coordinates are (0,1); that is, with the point 1 unit north of the origin. Recall that we chose to view [...] "multiplication by √-1" [...] as a rotation by 90 degrees counterclockwise about the origin.A good test of whether we have understood this passage from complex numbers to points on the plane is to ask ourselves what would be different if we had identified [...] "multiplication by √-1" [...] as a rotation of the plane 90 degrees clockwise; or, {{what would be the}} same, 270 degrees counterclockwise?The brief answer here is that nothing whatsoever would change, except for the curious fact that i would be playing the role that -i plays in our identification, -i would be playing the role that <b>i</b> <b>plays,</b> and more generally, the complex number a - bi would be playing the role that a + bi plays. Behind this lies a surprise, and a curious mirror. There is no intrinsic (algebraic) way of distinguishing +√-1 from -√-1. Each of them, of course, is a square root of −1. The only distinction between them is given by their names, and our choosing to put +i north of the origin and -i south of it. We could have reversed our choice, provided we kept track of that, and worked consistently with this other choice. These entities, +i and -i, are twins, and the only breaking of their symmetry comes from {{the way in which we}} name them. Imagine the analogous moment when parents of newly born identical twins choose names for their two children, thereby making the first, and immensely important, distinction between them.A reader of an early draft of this book asked why I called +i and -i twins, but did not, for example, call +1 and −1 twins. Here is why. The number +1 is distinguished from the number −1 by some purely algebraic property (for example, it is equal to its square), while there is no analogous property, described entirely in terms of addition and multiplication, that distinguishes +i from -i and yet does not, either directly or indirectly, make use of the names we gave to them.The complex numbers a + bi and a - bi are called conjugates. And the act of [...] "conjugation"—that is, passing from a complex number to its conjugate (or equivalently, reversing the sign of the imaginary part of a complex number)—is a basic symmetry of the complex number system. There are other number systems that admit a bewildering collection of symmetries, of internal mirrors. One of the great challenges to modern algebra is to understand, and use, these internal mirrors.Barry Mazur, Imagining Numbers (Particularly the Square Root of Minus Fifteen), Chapter 12, pp215-7 ...|$|E

40|$|The neuronal-specific protein complexin I (CPX <b>I)</b> <b>plays</b> an {{important}} role in controlling the Ca(2 +) -dependent neurotransmitter release. Since insulin exocytosis and neurotransmitter release rely on similar molecular mechanisms and that pancreatic beta-cells and neuronal cells share the expression of many restricted genes, we investigated the potential role of CPX I in insulin-secreting cells. We found that pancreatic islets and several insulin-secreting cell lines express high levels of CPX I. The beta-cell expression of CPX I is mediated by the presence of a neuron restrictive silencer element located within the regulatory region of the gene. This element bound the transcriptional repressor REST, which is found in most cell types with the exception of mature neuronal cells and beta-cells. Overexpression of CPX I or silencing of the CPX I gene (Cplx 1) by RNA interference led to strong impairment in beta-cell secretion in response to nutrients such as glucose, leucine and KCl. This effect was detected both in the early and the sustained secretory phases but was much more pronounced in the early phase. We conclude that CPX <b>I</b> <b>plays</b> a critical role in beta-cells in the control of the stimulated-exocytosis of insulin...|$|E
