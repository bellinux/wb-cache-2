2500|$|Blanding {{had another}} strong season in 1913, going 15–10 with an ERA of 2.55 and an Adjusted ERA+ of 118. He opened the 1913 {{season with a}} 12-4 record. After Blanding pitched a {{complete}} game shutout against the Detroit Tigers in April 1913, E. A. Batchelor wrote in the Detroit Free Press that Blanding was [...] "not so brilliant in his display of speed and curves," [...] but [...] "he <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> dinky curves," [...] that, with control, was enough to beat the Tigers. At {{the end of the}} 1913 season, Sporting Life editor Ed Bang wrote of Blanding: [...] "Fritz has always proved himself a willing worker and game to the core." ...|$|E
2500|$|Georges {{begins as}} a {{potential}} hero, though the seeds of destruction are present from the beginning:Georges had all the talents necessary for becoming a well-regarded gentleman; yet he was possessed of a haughty, tenacious, willful nature; he <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> oriental sorts of dispositions, the kind that, once pushed far enough from the path of virtue, will stride boldly down the path of crime. He would have given ten {{years of his life}} to know the name of his father, but he dared not violate the solemn oath he had made to his dying mother. It was as if nature pushed him toward Alfred; he liked him, as much as one can like a man; and Alfred esteemed him, but with that esteem that the horseman bears for the most handsome and vigorous of his chargers. Georges is instinctively drawn toward his natural father, who can only regard Georges {{as if he were a}} prized animal. Georges is Alfred's property rather than his heir, and by law can become the property of the half-sibling infant recognized as [...] "legitimate". The mulatto, as he is called repeatedly throughout the story in place of his given name, is denied the oedipal knowledge of his identity that would prevent a tragic end.|$|E
2500|$|... "A Short Trip Home", Saturday Evening Post, January 17, 1927. [...] "Joe Jelke and {{two other}} boys were along, {{and none of the}} three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me. She <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{exquisite}} rose skins frequent in our part of the country, and beautiful until the little veins begin to break at about forty; now, flushed with the cold, it was a riot of lovely delicate pinks like many carnations. She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming—that she was safe. There was talk of the Pump and Slipper dance at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside. I walked home with a certain depression of spirit and lay for an hour in a hot bath thinking that vacation was all over for me now that she was gone; feeling, even more deeply than I had yesterday, that she was out of my life." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> little ten-pound gigs for market--and nice flowers, and birds--cocks and hens I mean, {{because they}} be useful," [...] {{continued}} Gabriel, feeling balanced between poetry and practicality.|$|R
60|$|She <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> mouths {{that look}} {{exactly like a}} gash in the face.|$|E
6000|$|... "If we <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> new-fashioned {{airships}} {{we could}} float away {{over the top}} of the forest, and look down and find just the places we want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What madness {{not to have}} <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> before {{tackling}} Aunt Dahlia! However, {{too late}} {{to worry about that}} now. Tell me of Gussie. How did he make out at the fancy-dress ball?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O mother, {{you must}} {{stay with the}} baby--what if he should <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> dreadful fits while you are gone! No, I can go very well; I have {{got used to the}} cold now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can leg it at {{a trifle}} over {{nineteen}} knots," [...] Captain Jones declared, {{as he picked}} up his cap, [...] "and, anyway, anything's better than <b>having</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> short-haired, smooth-tongued, blustering Germans on board." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then thought I with myself, [...] "Who that goeth on pilgrimage {{but would}} <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> maps about him, {{that he may}} look, when he is at a stand, {{which is the way}} he must take?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If we only <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Reservation Indians with us, {{he might}} help us {{pick up the}} trail," [...] {{declared}} Roger. [...] "As it is, I must confess I'm {{not much of a}} trail-finder." ...|$|E
60|$|I read {{it through}} twice, {{and the second}} time I <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> ideas I do {{sometimes}} get, though admittedly a chump of the premier class. I have seldom had such a thoroughly corking brain-wave.|$|E
60|$|For my part, I <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> dreamy {{periods of}} {{existence}} {{in which people}} doubt whether they are awake or asleep. The world seemed all turning topsy-turvy. I was filled with curiosity, which I could with difficulty keep {{within the limits of}} conventional propriety.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an episode}} of the sitcom Roseanne, Roseanne throws her back out and exclaims [...] "I threw my back out and I don't <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> things! I shouldn't have laughed at that old lady on TV!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Stop a bit!' cried Bounderby, who {{all this}} time had been standing, as before, on the hearth, {{bursting}} at the very furniture {{of the room with}} explosive humility. 'You <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> strollers' children in the school.' ...|$|R
60|$|It wasn't that {{he spoke}} loud. He <b>has</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> soft, {{soothing}} voices that slide through the atmosphere like the note of a far-off sheep. It was what he said made me leap like a young gazelle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Dromore, sir," [...] the man said--he <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{strictly}} confidential faces bestowed by an all-wise Providence on servants in the neighbourhood of Piccadilly--"Mr. Dromore, sir, is not in. But {{he will be}} almost sure to be in to dress. Miss Nell is in, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{the upshot}} {{of it was that}} instead of taking chloroform, Pupkin stepped up to the counter of the {{fountain}} and he had a bromo-seltzer with cherry soda, and after that he <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> aerated seltzers, and then a couple of lemon seltzers and a bromo-phizzer.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pennel <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> natures--gentle, trustful, and hopeful, {{because not}} very deep; {{she was one}} of the little {{children}} of the world whose faith rests on child-like ignorance, and who know not the deeper needs of deeper natures; such see only the sunshine and forget the storm.|$|E
6000|$|He was {{drowned out}} by Pinky's effusive, [...] "True {{hospitality}} is a virtue as delicate as it is rare. We accept your invitation. In fact I should be glad to <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> cigarros elegantos that mine olfactory----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{you can go}} down to the Mineral Development's new shaft, {{where they}} <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> tramways working, and see how they swing their ore across the valley. I'll give you a line to the manager. Start when you're ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Look here, March," [...] said Fulkerson, {{with the}} effect of taking a fresh hold; [...] "I wish you could let me <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> New York things of yours for the first number. After all, that's {{going to be the}} great card." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stanley has disappeared!" [...] he gasped. [...] "He <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> letters last night. It lies on {{his table}} now, his servant says. There was a noise {{in his room}} at four o'clock this morning. When they called him---he had gone! No one has seen or heard of him since!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was looking}} forward to a good night's sleep," [...] Osgod grumbled, [...] "but your idea, master, has quite done away with that. If I went off I should dream that I <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Welsh wolves at my throat. However, it is a good thing that you thought of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{could see}} that Montgomery <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> slow, pertinacious tempers that will warm day after day to a white heat, and never again cool to forgiveness; and I saw too that this quarrel had been some time growing. [...] "The man's drunk," [...] said I, perhaps officiously; [...] "you'll do no good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If I {{could only}} carry it, I'd <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> dears, {{no matter what}} it cost!' cried Lavinia, more captivated by a live cat than by all the dead Huguenots that Catherine de Medicis hung over the castle walls on a certain memorable occasion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} doubt it, girl, were it only for thy sake; {{and yet he}} <b>has</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> faces which men tremble when they look on. I think even thy mother, Janet--nay, have done with that poking-iron--could hardly look upon him without quaking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say no {{more than}} I have given you warrant for, mine host, and so shall you be sure you speak {{no more than}} is true. A man may <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> honourable prefixes to his name, yet be born far from Saint Michael's Mount." ...|$|R
60|$|He woke, and for {{a minute}} tried to {{remember}} {{what he had been}} dreaming, and what it all meant. But he quickly relinquished the effort. So he looked at his watch: it was only half-past three. He <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> American watches with luminous, phosphorescent figures and fingers. And tonight he felt afraid of its eerily shining face.|$|E
60|$|The boy <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> long {{faces of}} the higher Jewish type, intelligent, wistful. He seemed dazed by Insall's kindness. The shoes he wore were those of an adult, but cracked and split, {{revealing}} the cotton stocking and here and there the skin. His little blue hands fumbled with the knotted strings that served for facings until Insall, producing a pocket knife, deftly cut the strings.|$|E
60|$|As we {{approached}} the forbidding and squalid inn, with {{the sign of a}} game-cock above the door, Holmes gave a sudden groan, and clutched me by the shoulder to save himself from falling. He had <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> violent strains of the ankle which leave a man helpless. With difficulty he limped up to the door, where a squat, dark, elderly man was smoking a black clay pipe.|$|E
5000|$|Buffy tells Giles, [...] "Ok, you're not <b>having</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> mid-life things, are you?

5000|$|... "We should <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Globe polls—'Who do {{you hate}} more?' I've {{challenged}} Borges to see who could get out the vote. It would be close. And {{it would be a}} lot more interesting than who’s going to win the MVP." [...] - Dan Shaughnessy ...|$|R
60|$|So Sally stayed--to <b>have</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> long night-talks {{in which}} girls delight, {{in the course}} of which all sorts of intimacies and confidences, that shun the {{daylight}}, open like the night-blooming cereus in strange successions. One often wonders by daylight at the things one says very naturally in the dark.|$|R
