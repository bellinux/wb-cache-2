5|$|A {{variable-frequency}} drive (VFD; also termed adjustable-frequency drive, variable speed drive, AC drive, micro drive or inverter drive) {{is a type}} of adjustable-speed drive used in <b>electro-mechanical</b> drive systems to control AC motor speed and torque by varying motor input frequency and voltage.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-1890s onwards Giovanni Giorgi and Oliver Heaviside {{corresponded with}} each other {{regarding}} these anomalous results. This led to Giorgi presenting a paper to {{the congress of the}} Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.) in October 1901 in which he showed that a coherent <b>electro-mechanical</b> system of units could be obtained by adding a fourth base unit of an electrical nature (ampere, volt or ohm) to the three base units proposed in the 1861 BAAS report. This gave the constants ke and km physical dimensions and hence the <b>electro-mechanical</b> quantities ε0 and µ0 were also given physical dimensions. His work also recognized the unifying concept that energy played in the establishment of a coherent, rational system of units with the joule as the unit of energy and the electrical units in the practical system of units remaining unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical gun games {{existed before}} the {{emergence}} of electronic video games, {{as far back as}} the 1920s. The first light guns appeared in the 1930s, with the Seeburg Ray-O-Lite. Games using this toy rifle were mechanical and the rifle fired beams of light at targets wired with sensors. These evolved throughout subsequent decades, culminating in games such as Sega's <b>electro-mechanical</b> arcade game Periscope, the company's first successful game, released in 1966. It required the player to target cardboard ships.|$|E
5|$|Sega later {{produced}} gun games which resemble first-person light gun video games, {{but were}} in fact <b>electro-mechanical</b> games that used rear image projection {{in a manner similar}} to a zoetrope to produce moving animations on a screen. An early example of this was Duck Hunt, which Sega released in 1969; it featured animated moving targets on a screen, printed out the player's score on a ticket, and had sound effects that were volume controllable.|$|E
5|$|The Mellotron is an <b>electro-mechanical,</b> {{polyphonic}} tape replay keyboard {{originally developed}} and built in Birmingham, England, in 1963. It {{evolved from a}} similar instrument, the Chamberlin, but could be mass-produced more effectively. The instrument works by pulling a section of magnetic tape across a head. Different portions of the tape can be played to access different sounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric {{rangefinders}} that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the crow's nest, {{to estimate the}} range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He transmitted his commands via a Geisler <b>electro-mechanical</b> fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with two British Barr and Stroud {{coincidence}} rangefinders that used two images {{that had to}} be superimposed to derive the range. The gunnery officer then calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target and transmitted his commands via a Geisler <b>electro-mechanical</b> fire-control transmission system to each turret.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} announcement, the exhibits, seating and wiring were {{dismantled}} or removed. Some {{of the signs}} and paintings were recovered by the RASC, which had a permanent workspace located within the facility, and are now {{on display at the}} E.C. Carr Astronomical Observatory in Blue Mountain, Ontario and at David Dunlap Observatory in Richmond Hill, Ontario. The original Zeiss-Jena projector was bought as a museum piece by York University for the sum of $1, subsequently dismantled, and placed into storage. More recently, the University has offered the mothballed projector to other planetaria seeking parts to repair their existing <b>electro-mechanical</b> planetarium projectors.|$|E

The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He transmitted his commands via a Geisler <b>electro-mechanical</b> fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret. Oslyabya {{and the rest of}} the Second Pacific Squadron were also fitted with Perepelkin telescopic sights for their guns, but their crews were not trained in how to use them.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1970s, <b>electro-mechanical</b> arcade {{games were}} {{gradually}} replaced by electronic video games, following {{the release of}} Pong in 1972, with 1978's Space Invaders dealing a yet more powerful blow to the popularity of mechanical games. Light guns used in electronic video games work in the opposite manner to their mechanical counterparts: the sensor is in the gun and pulling the trigger allows it to receive light from the on-screen targets. Computer light pens had been used for practical purposes at MIT in the early 1960s, and the Magnavox Odyssey had a light gun accessory, {{in the production of}} which Nintendo was involved.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by <b>electro-mechanical</b> generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or flowing water. The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|E
5|$|Similar to the An-124, the An-70 design makes {{extensive}} use of titanium and composites to keep weight to a minimum and increase damage resistance. Approximately 25 percent of the airframe is made of carbon-fibre composites, which are primarily used on control surfaces and the tail assembly, while aluminium and steel alloys are used {{for the rest of}} the structure. The An-70 has a designed life of 45,000hours over 15,000flights. The prototypes had a fly-by-wire flight-control system that comprised three digital channels and six analog channels; it was expected that production aircraft would have a four-channel digital fly-by-wire system. Aircraft and system information are mainly relayed to the pilot and co-pilot via six large multi-function CRT displays, with secondary <b>electro-mechanical</b> instruments and head-up displays; a flight engineer position is also present on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The Borodino {{class were}} {{originally}} fitted with Liuzhol stadiametric rangefinders that used the angle between two vertical points on an enemy ship, usually the waterline and the crow's nest, {{to estimate the}} range. The gunnery officer consulted his references to get the range and calculated the proper elevation and deflection required to hit the target. He then transmitted his commands via a Geisler <b>electro-mechanical</b> fire-control transmission system to each gun or turret. While fitting out, these rangefinders were replaced on the first four ships by two Barr and Stroud coincidence rangefinders that used two images {{that had to be}} superimposed to derive the range. Perepelkin telescopic sights were also installed for their guns, but their crews were not trained in how to use them.|$|E
5|$|The F-20's {{avionics}} suite was all-new {{and greatly}} improved over the earlier designs. The General Electric AN/APG-67 multi-mode radar was {{the heart of}} the sensor suite, offering a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. The F-5's <b>electro-mechanical</b> navigation system was replaced with an all-electronic version based on a ring laser gyroscope. Time from power-on to being able to launch was greatly reduced as a result, to about 22 seconds, and Northrop boasted that the aircraft had the shortest scramble time of any contemporary aircraft. The cockpit of the F-5 was completely re-worked with a large head-up display (HUD) and two monochrome multi-function displays set high on the control panel, and the addition of a complete hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control system. Many of the avionics promised to have reliability beyond that of any competing aircraft then in service.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, {{when all}} {{airframe}} maintenance at Laverton {{was transferred to}} Nos.2 and 3 Aircraft Depots, No.1 AD had serviced forty-two aircraft types throughout its existence. It continued to maintain aero engines, and began supporting telecommunications equipment as well. The aircraft engine repair facilities at No.1 AD were closed down in 1968. Staff were transferred to No.3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, {{to prepare for the}} introduction of the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber to Australian service and concentrate on maintaining the new aircraft's engines. No.1 AD's focus thereafter shifted to ground support, manufacturing, installing, servicing and providing training for navigational, air traffic control, telecommunications and motor transport equipment used by the Air Force and other sections of Defence and government. From 1968 to 1977, the depot was organised into two components, Telecommunications Installation and Maintenance Squadron and Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron. These were subdivided in February 1977 into Telecommunications Squadron (maintaining ground communications equipment for control towers, transmitters and receiving stations in Australia and the region), Radar Squadron (supporting surveillance systems at RAAF Bases Williamtown, Amberley, Townsville, Darwin and Pearce), Ground Equipment Maintenance Squadron (maintaining motor transport, and other ground-based mechanical and <b>electro-mechanical</b> systems), and Intermediate Level Maintenance Squadron (communications, navigation and other ground-based maintenance at Laverton, as well as spectrometric analysis of oil used by the RAAF in aircraft and other equipment).|$|E
25|$|The first {{interactive}} movie {{game was}} Nintendo's Wild Gunman, a 1974 <b>electro-mechanical</b> arcade game that used film reel projection to display live-action full-motion video (FMV) footage of Wild West gunslingers. In the 1970s, Kasco (Kansei Seiki Seisakusho) released a hit <b>electro-mechanical</b> arcade game with live-action FMV, projecting car footage filmed by Toei.|$|E

25|$|In 1914, Leonardo Torres y Quevedo {{designed}} an <b>electro-mechanical</b> {{version of}} Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine, and included floating-point arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|During the re-modelling of Victoria Station between 1898 and 1908 it was re-signalled {{using the}} Sykes <b>electro-mechanical</b> method for {{controlling}} points and signals, allowing for more compact signal boxes.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, the Harvard Mark I was {{constructed}} at IBM's Endicott laboratories; {{it was a}} similar general purpose <b>electro-mechanical</b> computer to the Z3, but was not quite Turing-complete.|$|E
25|$|Bullseye Targets: These are static {{targets that}} have two {{concentric}} elements, {{similar to a}} stationary target. Hitting the outer ring usually scores lower than hitting the center bull's eye. They are found mostly on older <b>electro-mechanical</b> games.|$|E
25|$|Before about 1905 when tube type {{rectifiers}} were developed, {{power conversion}} devices were purely <b>electro-mechanical</b> in design. Mechanical rectification systems used {{some form of}} rotation or resonant vibration (e.g. vibrators) driven by electromagnets, which operated a switch or commutator to reverse the current.|$|E
25|$|The first {{television}} broadcast in Australia {{took place on}} 30 September 1929 at the Menzies Hotel in Melbourne, using the <b>electro-mechanical</b> Radiovision system. Other transmissions {{took place in the}} city over the next few weeks. Also in 1929, the Baird system was used on 3DB, 3UZ and 2UE.|$|E
25|$|The Trident's {{advanced}} avionics {{displayed the}} aircraft's momentary position {{relative to the}} ground on a moving map display on the centre instrument panel. This <b>electro-mechanical</b> device also recorded the aircraft's track using a stylus plotting on a motor-driven paper map. Positional information was given by a Doppler navigation system which read groundspeed and drift data which, alongside heading data, drove the stylus.|$|E
25|$|Stereoscopic 3D {{television}} was demonstrated {{for the first}} time on August 10, 1928, by John Logie Baird in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London. Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using <b>electro-mechanical</b> and cathode-ray tube techniques. The first 3D TV was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D TVs.|$|E
25|$|The {{automatic}} telephone switchboard {{was introduced in}} 1892 along with dial telephones. By 1929, 31.9% of the Bell system was automatic. Automatic telephone switching originally used vacuum tube amplifiers and <b>electro-mechanical</b> switches, which consumed {{a large amount of}} electricity. Call volume eventually grew so fast that it was feared the telephone system would consume all electricity production, prompting Bell Labs to begin research on the transistor.|$|E
25|$|There were {{a number}} of {{additions}} to the stadium in the years after construction including a number of smaller stands around the track and the construction of a restaurant in the main stand. One of the most renowned additions was the Australian-invented Julius totalisator. This <b>electro-mechanical</b> computer, installed in 1930 and extended and upgraded in 1948, saw continuous service until the stadium was closed in 1987.|$|E
25|$|Situation {{awareness}} {{appears in}} the technical literature as early as 1983, when describing {{the benefits of a}} prototype touch-screen navigation display. During the early 1980s, integrated “vertical-situation” and “horizontal-situation” displays were being developed for commercial aircraft to replace multiple <b>electro-mechanical</b> instruments. Integrated situation displays combined the information from several instruments enabling more efficient access to critical flight parameters, thereby improving situational awareness and reducing pilot workload.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 V5:Fitted {{with the}} larger, more {{powerful}} 14-cylinder two-row BMW 801 radial engine. This engine introduced a pioneering {{example of an}} engine management system called the Kommandogerät (command-device) designed by BMW, who also designed the 801's forward cowling with its integral oil cooling system: the Kommandogerät functioned in effect as an <b>electro-mechanical</b> computer which set mixture, propeller pitch (for the constant-speed propeller), boost, and magneto timing.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the British at Bletchley Park (40 {{miles north}} of London) {{achieved}} a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications. The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked {{with the help of}} the <b>electro-mechanical</b> bombes. They ruled out possible Enigma settings by performing chains of logical deductions implemented electrically. Most possibilities led to a contradiction, and the few remaining could be tested by hand.|$|E
25|$|The bombe was an <b>electro-mechanical</b> {{device that}} {{replicated}} {{the action of}} several Enigma machines wired together. A standard German Enigma employed, at any one time, a set of three rotors, each {{of which could be}} set in any of 26 positions. The standard British bombe contained 36 Enigma equivalents, each with three drums wired to produce the same scrambling effect as the Enigma rotors. A bombe could run two or three jobs simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{aftermarket}} modifications and upgrades {{are available}} for 200 and 300 Series King Airs. One company offers a Wing Front Spar Reinforcement Kit for 200 Series aircraft and a modification to replace the <b>electro-mechanical</b> landing gear retraction system of early-build aircraft with an electro-hydraulic system. Raisbeck Engineering out of Seattle, WA offers Enhanced Performance Leading Edges, Nacelle Wing Lockers, Ram Air Recovery System, Quiet Turbofan Propellers, High Flotation Gear Doors and Dual Aft Body Strakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{only major}} <b>electro-mechanical</b> {{breakdown}} of the GG1 {{was caused by a}} blizzard which swept across the northeastern United States in February 1958. The storm put nearly half of the GG1s out of commission. Exceptionally fine snow, caused by the extreme low temperatures, was able to pass through the traction motors' air filters and into the electrical components. The snow then melted and short circuited the components. On about 40 units, the air intakes were moved to a position under the pantographs.|$|E
25|$|A comptometer is a {{mechanical}} or <b>electro-mechanical</b> adding machine. The comptometer {{was the first}} adding device to be driven solely {{by the action of}} pressing keys, which are arranged in an array of vertical and horizontal columns. Although the comptometer was designed primarily for adding, it could also do division, multiplication, and subtraction. Special comptometers with varying key arrays were produced for a variety of purposes, including calculating currencies, time and Imperial measures of weight. The original design was invented and patented in 1887 by Dorr Felt.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, Hungarian {{engineer}} Peter Carl Goldmark {{introduced an}} <b>electro-mechanical</b> system while at CBS, which contained an Iconoscope sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, {{and a similar}} disc spinning in synchronization {{in front of the}} cathode ray tube inside the receiver set. The system was first demonstrated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on August 29, 1940, and shown to the press on September 4.|$|E
