5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation <b>is</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water when they come out of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E
25|$|A {{parallel}} {{has been}} drawn between these {{activities and the}} human condition according to the Biblical account of the expulsion from the garden of Eden. Refraining from these symbolically represents {{a return to a}} pristine state, which is the theme of the day. By refraining from these activities, the body <b>is</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> but can still survive. The soul is considered to be the life force in a body. Therefore, by making one’s body uncomfortable, one’s soul <b>is</b> <b>uncomfortable.</b> By feeling pain one can feel how others feel when they are in pain. This is the purpose of the prohibitions.|$|E

Leslie is appalled when he learns that the humans do not lay eggs. Nancy explains human gestation and that they have three children.|$|E
25|$|Charlie <b>is</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> {{with the}} lengths {{to which his}} wife goes {{to connect with the}} lizards. Because Sarah has never seen a mammal's mammaries, Nancy shows Sarah her breasts and {{explains}} their function. Nancy would also have shown Leslie except for Charlie's protestations. While Nancy does become a bit frustrated with the lizards' intellectual limitations, she becomes increasingly annoyed with Charlie's condescending attitude toward them. Yet, when the lizards want to go back—after Charlie drives Sarah to tears, and Leslie beats him up—Nancy wants them to stay and offers them help. This experience has given Nancy the excitement she craves, and she ensures that it continues.|$|E
25|$|Epithelial {{surfaces}} may sustain {{damage from}} radiation therapy. Depending {{on the area}} being treated, this may include the skin, oral mucosa, pharyngeal, bowel mucosa and ureter. The rates of onset of damage and recovery from it depend upon the turnover rate of epithelial cells. Typically the skin starts to become pink and sore several weeks into treatment. The reaction may become more severe during the treatment and {{for up to about}} one week following the end of radiation therapy, and the skin may break down. Although this moist desquamation <b>is</b> <b>uncomfortable,</b> recovery is usually quick. Skin reactions tend to be worse in areas where there are natural folds in the skin, such as underneath the female breast, behind the ear, and in the groin.|$|E

They split the costs of their life evenly {{with a list of}} things that they share, making their home life contentious. Seeing that Lena is unhappy with her marriage, Ying-Ying reasserts herself by knocking over a table in the bedroom and causing the vase to fall from the table and break. Hearing the sudden noise, Lena goes to her mother and admits her unhappiness. Ying-Ying replies that Lena should leave and not come back until Harold gives her what she wants. At June's farewell party, Lena is shown to have a new vibrant fiancé, who has given Lena what she wants and is accepting of Ying-Ying.|$|E
25|$|If Charlie <b>is</b> <b>uncomfortable</b> with Nancy and her desires, he has bigger {{problems}} with the lizards. At first, he insists {{that they are a}} death hallucination caused by rotten liver paste sandwiches. While the creatures intrigue Nancy, Charlie continually acts with fear and resistance. He follows his wife's lead on posing submissively when the creatures first approach, but he will not respond to them until she orders him to. Even after the ice has been broken, Charlie remains uncertain about the creatures and their intentions. Leslie and Sarah's ignorance on many things (emotions, anatomy, etc.) adds to Charlie's negative attitude. When he has to explain these ideas to them, he is easily frustrated and often condescending. He drives Leslie to beat and choke him. Yet at the end, Charlie agrees with Nancy that the lizards have to stay on land and not go back into the water. Though he helps because Nancy will do it whether or not he agrees, Charlie does offer to take them by the hand.|$|E
