5000|$|Five {{macroeconomic}} {{variables that}} affect the probability of sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> are: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> is the {{lengthening}} of {{the time}} of debt repayment and forgiving, or dismissing, part of the loan.|$|E
50|$|Valdepeñas {{served as}} a {{consultant}} of the Swedish International Development Authority on Bank Supervision since 1990 and of Citibank on external <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling,</b> rationalization of bank investment portfolio and public policy analysis since 1986.|$|E
50|$|The London Club is {{also the}} {{organization}} responsible for <b>rescheduling</b> <b>debt</b> payments made by countries to commercial banks.|$|R
50|$|Sustainable debt is {{the level}} of debt which allows a debtor country to meet its current and future debt service {{obligations}} in full, without recourse to further <b>debt</b> relief or <b>rescheduling,</b> avoiding accumulation of arrears, while allowing an acceptable level of economic growth.|$|R
50|$|Schemes of {{arrangement}} {{are used}} to execute arbitrary changes {{in the structure of}} a business and thus are used when a reorganisation cannot be achieved by other means. They may be used for <b>rescheduling</b> <b>debt,</b> for takeovers, and for returns of capital, among other purposes.|$|R
5000|$|The debate {{ended in}} September 1980 when TDB Resolution 222 (XXI) {{was adopted by}} consensus. Part B of the {{resolution}} contains the “Detailed Features for Future Operations Relating to the Debt Problems of Interested Developing Countries”. The Resolution was adopted without dissent, albeit with France abstaining to emphasise its strict neutrality, being host of the debt renegotiations, as this time the resolution made explicit reference to the Paris Club as the recognised multilateral forum for bilateral <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling.</b> [...] Part B of resolution 222 (XXI), the “Detailed Features for Future Operations Relating to the Debt Problems of Interested Developing Countries”, were in fact an agreed “code of conduct” for official <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> as only governments (UNCTAD constituency) were represented when it was adopted.|$|E
50|$|From 2000 to 2011, {{there are}} {{approximately}} 16 Chinese official development finance projects identified in Seychelles through various media reports. These projects range from a concessional loan of 300 million RMB in 2007, to a 321 million <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> in 2011, and a development aid grant worth $8 million USD in 2011.|$|E
50|$|Shonekan {{learned of}} the dire {{condition}} of government finances, which {{he was unable to}} correct. The 1993 budget was pegged to include a 28 billion naira deficit with little money left in its foreign reserves. The government was hard pressed on debt obligations and had to hold constant talks for <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling.</b>|$|E
50|$|In February 2009, the {{cancellation}} or postponement of four projects in Europe and Asia forced {{the firm to}} enter into a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), a deal to stave off insolvency proceedings which prevents financial collapse by <b>rescheduling</b> <b>debts</b> - estimated at about £1m - to creditors.|$|R
50|$|In 2001/2002 the United States imposed {{economic}} sanctions against the state of Zimbabwe, through the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001 or ZDERA, , vetoing or voting against access to financing, <b>debt</b> relief and <b>rescheduling,</b> and forcing the Zimbabwean government to operate on a cash-only basis.|$|R
50|$|Non-HIPC {{countries}} seeking {{debt relief}} first undergo an IMF debt sustainability analysis. This analysis determines whether the country {{suffers from a}} liquidity problem, a debt sustainability problem, or both. If the IMF determines that the country suffers from a temporary liquidity problem, its <b>debts</b> are <b>rescheduled</b> until a later date. If the country is also determined to suffer from debt sustainability problems, where it lacks the long-term resources to meet its debt obligations {{and the amount of}} debt adversely affects its future ability to pay, the country is eligible for debt cancellation.|$|R
50|$|In November 1981, he was {{appointed}} as Governor of the Bank of Greece, where he remained until February, 1984. During this period, Arsenis oversaw the liberalization of the Greek financial system and modernization of its financial regulatory system. Arsenis acted as a policy advisor to numerous governments regarding foreign exchange, external financing and <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, {{in order}} to pay its due debts, Romania {{requested}} the International Monetary Fund a line of credit and adopted a policy to pay back all its debt. The decision to repay the debt has been considered irrational, as other developing countries that were hit by the same problem were able to obtain <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> or [...] "haircuts".|$|E
50|$|Aggarwal {{has been}} {{influential}} {{in the fields of}} U.S. trade policy, corporate strategy, international trade institutions, globalization, international <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling,</b> international political economy, and international relations. His research expertise includes the international politics of trade, international finance, comparative public policy, rational choice, and bargaining theory. Frequently, he has been sought out in these areas by the private and public sector.|$|E
5000|$|Stringent {{policies}} {{with regard to}} social expenditures and employment in the state sector have led to riots and political protests in Greece. Another response is to shift losses from the central bank to private investors who are asked to [...] "share the pain" [...] of partial defaults that {{take the form of}} <b>rescheduling</b> <b>debt</b> payments.|$|R
25|$|In 2002, Lufthansa Consulting {{was awarded}} a {{management}} contract with Air Madagascar, {{with a view to}} improving the airlines' efficiency and making it an attractive enterprise for privatisation. The airline's creditors in November 2002 agreed to forgive half of the company's <b>debts</b> and <b>rescheduled</b> the rest over a three-year period. Because of the political crisis, the first half of 2001 saw a 66% drop in passenger traffic and a 71% drop in freight, which damaged the airline's revenues. The airline resumed flights to Paris from Antananarivo on 27 April 2003, taking over from Blue Panorama Airlines which had been operating on its behalf since the crisis began.|$|R
40|$|The {{cooperation}} between international organizations, private banks, and national governments as put {{forward in the}} Baker Plan has prevented major disruptions of the international financial system resulting from the <b>debt</b> crisis. <b>Rescheduling</b> agreements have been reached in large numbers. Financial innovations have provided flexibility to the banking system in dealing with their large exposure. But the disappointing response to the Mexican debt-swap initiative has also shown that financial innovations cannot be relied on solely to reduce the debt burden to levels that reestablish the credibility of major debtors. Structural adjustment efforts {{under the supervision of}} the IMF do not show the desired results either - more often proposals are put forward which demand a reexamination of some ingredients of the old debt management strategy. The conventional approach and new proposals are evaluated below...|$|R
50|$|Mortgage {{modification}} is {{a process}} where {{the terms of a}} mortgage are modified outside the original terms of the contract agreed to by the lender and borrower (i.e. mortgagee and mortgagor in mortgage states; Trustee and Trustor in Trust Deed states). In general, any loan can be modified, and the process is referred to as loan modification or <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the western}} {{international}} community, {{as well as the}} OAU, considered the October 2000 elections to have been seriously flawed. Foreign donor institutions which halted aid pending a return to civilian rule have largely continued their freeze. The London Club has also not expressed a willingness to revisit the issue of <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling.</b> The electoral shifts in the country therefore continue to mar foreign relations.|$|E
50|$|Credit {{restructuring}} is {{made more}} likely by a higher amount of imports relative to FX reserves. A {{less developed country}} will pay for imports with its foreign exchange reserves. The more it imports the faster these reserves are used up. Since satisfying a country's needs is considered more important than repaying foreign creditors the more a country imports relative to its foreign exchange reserves the greater the probability of <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Two early {{negotiations}} {{helped establish}} {{the reputation of}} the firm's sovereign practice, which represents a large number of nations, particularly in the former Communist and other emerging markets. During that time, Hurlock helped Indonesia reschedule more than US$10 billion of debt, mostly held by foreign banks, when state oil company Pertamina was unable to meet payments. The firm also helped Turkey <b>reschedule</b> <b>debt</b> incurred after the Turkish central bank accepted Turkish lira deposits convertible into hard western currencies.|$|R
50|$|As Foreign Affairs Minister, Malik {{conducted}} {{trips to}} Western countries to <b>reschedule</b> <b>debt</b> payments. Malik also quit the Murba Party that year {{to put himself}} {{more in line with}} the new regime's more open economic policies. The Murba Party having been a party that rejected foreign investments. In 1967, Malik, together with the Foreign Ministers of Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Singapore would officially form ASEAN in a bid to form a united front in the face of Communist expansion in Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|The {{violence}} continued throughout 1994, {{although the}} economy began to improve during this time; following {{negotiations with the}} IMF, the government succeeded in <b>rescheduling</b> <b>debt</b> repayments, providing it with a substantial financial windfall, and further obtained some 40 billion francs {{from the international community}} to back its economic liberalization. As it became obvious that the fighting would continue for some time, General Liamine Zéroual was named new president of the High Council of State; he was considered to belong to the dialoguiste (pro-negotiation) rather than éradicateur (eradicator) faction of the army.|$|R
5000|$|Debt {{restructuring}} within Italy {{may occur}} either {{out of court}} (ex article 67 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) when a waiver or simple <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> is required, or through a court-mediated debt restructuring agreement (ex article 182/bis of the Italian Bankruptcy Law) and may provide for a partial waiver of debts, mandatory recapitalization of the debtor, or for a liquidation of certain debtor's assets to repay privileged creditors.|$|E
50|$|As the 1980s progressed, <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> {{efforts in}} Latin America created many new and easily traded {{instruments}} such as Brady bonds that brought new players into the market, including banks and hedge funds. The original creditors then wrote down their positions {{and sold the}} debt into the secondary market, which is a market consisting of banks and investment funds focused on buying at discounts to achieve above market returns on their investment.|$|E
50|$|The {{probability}} of rescheduling {{is an increasing}} function of debt service ratio, import ratio, variance of export revenue and domestic money supply growth. The likelihood of rescheduling is a decreasing function of investment ratio due to future economic productivity gains. <b>Debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> likelihood can increase if the investment ratio rises as the foreign country could become less dependent on its external creditors and so be less concerned about receiving credit from these countries/investors.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid-1970s}} Pan Am had racked up $364million of {{accumulated}} losses over a 10-year period, and its debts approached $1billion. This threatened the airline with bankruptcy. Former American Airlines {{vice president of}} operations, William T. Seawell, who had replaced Najeeb Halaby as Pan Am president in 1972, began implementing a turnaround strategy: trimming the network by 25%, slashing the 40,000-strong workforce by 30% and cutting wages, introducing stringent economies and <b>rescheduling</b> <b>debt,</b> and reducing {{the size of the}} fleet. These measures aided by the use of tax-loss credits enabled Pan Am to avert financial collapse and return to profitability in 1977.|$|R
5000|$|However, policymakers in the South {{are often}} skeptical of {{capitalism}} and have proposed alternative solutions. In 1974, Southern nations called for a New International Economic Order (NIEO) to restructure the global economy. Their demands included linking prices of commodity exports to manufactured imports, transferring technology from North to South, cancelling or <b>rescheduling</b> <b>debts</b> of the Third World, {{improving the quality of}} their representation within institutions such as the World Bank, UN Security Council, standardizing prices for raw materials, solving food crises, and [...] "opening up of the North’s market for manufactured or semi-processed goods of the South." ...|$|R

5000|$|Peak US {{indebtedness}} was in August 1919 at a {{value of}} $25,596,000,000 for Liberty Bonds, Victory Notes, War Savings Certificates, and other government securities. As early as 1922 {{the possibility that the}} war debt could not be paid in full within the expected schedule was raised, and that <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> may be needed. In 1921 the Treasury Department began issuing short term notes maturing in three to five years to repay the Victory Loan ...|$|E
50|$|During {{its second}} decade, the journal {{expanded}} publication to three issues per year, experimented with theme issues and published {{some of the}} early proceedings of the Friedmann Conference held annually at Columbia Law School. By the beginning of its third decade, the journal’s theme issues—entire issues dedicated to the examination of current international law problems—had become regular publications. These topical issues have examined international taxation, international trade embargoes and boycotts, China’s legal development, sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling,</b> socialist law and international satellite communications.|$|E
50|$|When the {{reliance}} on these controls proved to be ineffective the Government adopted a new strategy involving the negotiation of a stabilisation and structural adjustment programme with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the negotiation of <b>debt</b> <b>rescheduling</b> agreements with creditor banks and the Paris Club. In the context of these agreements, the Bank, in the early 1990s embarked on a comprehensive programme of financial sector reform geared to liberalise the financial system {{as well as to}} modernise the Bank's prudential and supervisory framework.|$|E
50|$|After {{a summer}} of uncertainty, on 1 August the administrators managed to get {{creditors}} to accept a Creditors Voluntary Agreement, which would <b>reschedule</b> <b>debts</b> and reinstate the players, who had gone unpaid since April. One player not to return was Benito Carbone, who sacrificed {{a large chunk of}} the money owed to him on his contract and moved back to Italy. Chairman Richmond resigned from the board of directors on 10 August, after a reign of eight years. He was replaced as chairman by theme park magnate and new co-owner Gordon Gibb, who, along with Julian Rhodes, had completed a take-over of the club at the 11th hour before Bradford were due to lose their Football League status.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, {{the company}} moved its {{headquarters}} from Indonesia to Singapore {{and began to}} borrow money to expand aggressively. It was soon heavily leveraged; from 1996 to 1998, it only produced 1.5 times as much cash flow as its interest costs. In March 2001, during the Asian Debt Crises, APP declared a moratorium on U.S.$13.9 billion in debt, resulting {{in one of the}} largest debt default in Asia market. Most of the <b>debt</b> was subsequently <b>rescheduled</b> at lower values. In November 2003, Jakarta-based subsidiary Indah Kiat sued the underwriter and holders of an issue of debt (in United States dollars) it had issued in 1994 under New York law; it sued, however, in Indonesia, and in February 2007 the Indonesian court declared the debt invalid.|$|R
