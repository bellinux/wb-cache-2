500|$|Bakersfield Californian – {{stated that}} [...] "local {{attorneys}} [...] mixed on the decision", citing {{a variety of}} local attorneys. These included a defense attorney as saying [...] "ime will tell whether this activist conservative-majority Supreme Court is {{doing the right thing}} in moving back the clock on Miranda rights" [...] and a district attorney as saying [...] "Miranda had been broadened over the years far beyond what was necessary for its original goal of protecting suspects from [...] ... police culture has dramatically changed for the better in the 40-plus years since it came into being". A second defense attorney was quoted as saying that [...] "t's placing too much on a person who is already in an incredibly stressful situation. If I sit you down in a chair in a little room and shine a harsh light in your face and question you for three hours, under those conditions <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> ham sandwich to confess." [...] A county public defender opined that the ruling was not unfavorable, as a clear answer would be preferable to uncertainty. Local police stated the ruling did not affect how interrogations would be conducted.|$|E
500|$|In a {{response}} to the record-breaking feats of Don Bradman, the English team that toured Australia in 1932–33—led by Douglas Jardine—adopted a tactic of fast, short pitched bowling directed at the body, later known as Bodyline. While Bodyline sought to curb Bradman, it was used against all the Australian batsmen, including Ponsford. After being bowled twice behind his legs—by Larwood for 32 in the first innings and for two in the second innings by Bill Voce—in the first Test at Sydney, Ponsford was omitted from the team for the second Test at Melbourne. Ponsford returned for the third Test in Adelaide, batting down the order. The Test was controversial and highly acrimonious; several Australian batsmen—including Woodfull and Bert Oldfield—were hit on the body and head from the English fast bowling. Ponsford was hit on several occasions during his innings of 85; he chose to turn his torso and take the rising balls on his body—especially on his left shoulder blade and backside—rather than risk a catch to the leg side fielders. When Ponsford returned to the dressing room after his dismissal, his teammates were amazed by the mass of bruises that covered his back and shoulders. Ponsford remarked to Bill O'Reilly, [...] "I wouldn't mind having a couple more if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> hundred." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the trial}} in November 1929, Shuler's lawyer cross-examined Cryer about {{allegations}} that he [...] "pitched dice at in Farmer Page's place," [...] and about his accumulation of wealth during his eight years as mayor. [...] Cryer testified {{that he had a}} personal fortune of $160,000 when he took office in 1921 and left office in 1929 with a personal wealth of $450,000 which Cryer credited to [...] "realty deals absolutely uninfluenced by his political position." [...] Asked if he had ever taken a bribe, Cryer replied: [...] "No, sir; never at any time, directly or indirectly. [...] I never profited by my office. [...] In fact, I considered it a financial detriment. [...] It was the darndest job I ever had. [...] It took practically all of my time, Sundays and every other day, and most of the night. [...] I had to take the telephone out of my house so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little sleep. [...] I used to come home at nights from a banquet or something and people would call me sometimes at 3 o'clock in the morning -- some of them apparently insane." ...|$|E

2500|$|On September 8, 1995, at UFC 7, Shamrock {{successfully}} {{defended the}} UFC Superfight Championship against UFC 6 Tournament Champion [...] "The Russian Bear" [...] Oleg Taktarov. Shamrock stated {{in his autobiography}} that he was uncomfortable fighting Taktarov, as Oleg trained with the Lion's Den {{and he did not}} wish to injure his friend and teammate. In Beyond the Lion's Den, Shamrock states; [...] "In addition to being his friend, I was also trying to get him into Pancrase and if I broke his leg it would be a while before he could recover and he needed the money. I figured my best chance of winning without seriously hurting him was to beat on him with punches... If I could open a cut and get him to start pouring blood, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> referee stoppage. It might not have been the best plan going into a fight, but considering the options it seemed like the best option available. And it turned out fine. I battered him around {{for the duration of the}} match, the bout was declared a draw and when Oleg recovered he went on to fight in Pancrase." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Scotiabank Saddledome {{was one of}} many {{buildings}} impacted by the 2013 Alberta floods. [...] The flooding of the Elbow and Bow Rivers swamped many areas of the city, including Stampede Park where the Saddledome is located. [...] The event level of the arena was reported to be filled with water up to the 10th row of seating and the dressing rooms and control room for the video replay screen were under water. At a press conference held on June 22, 2013, team president Ken King stated that the arena had flooded up to the eighth row and that the event level of the facility was a [...] "total loss." [...] He added that the team's equipment and some memorabilia had also been destroyed, but expressed confidence that the facility would be repaired and ready in time for the October start to the season. Prospect Ben Hanowski was among the 100,000 people forced to evacuate by the floods. He described the situation as [...] "almost terrifying," [...] but praised the city's community spirit in the disaster: [...] "I didn’t know how I was going to get [...] I didn’t know if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> rental car out of the garage and through some water to get up here, and I had a person come up to me right away and ask if I had a place to go and if I had a way to get there and basically offered me a ride somewhere. I’d never met the person before. I think that example, right there, kind of speaks to what the city of Calgary is all about." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's true," [...] mused Peter. [...] "I {{spoke to}} Wilkinson, of Kingsley's, myself. He advised {{me to try}} and get Landor's. He thought that if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>an</b> {{advertisement}} out of Landor, he might persuade his people to give us theirs." ...|$|R
