[...] As the season's filming progressed, Leachman tired of playing a <b>farm</b> <b>woman.</b> She wouldn't sign a contract, {{and refused to}} do PR for the show's sponsor, Campbell's Soup, telling the company, [...] "I make my own soup. I don't eat yours." [...] Audiences found Leachman and co-star Jon Shepodd as Paul Martin [...] "too stiff". The two worked adult glances and touches such as holding hands, hugs, pecks on the lips into their {{on-screen}} performances {{in order to give}} their characters more depth. [...] Toward the end of the season, George Chandler was hired to play a grandfatherly character and to bring some warmth to the show, but Leachman was soon feuding with him; their disagreements appeared in the gossip columns. [...] With ratings plummeting and public resentment aroused, show owner Jack Wrather summarily fired Leachman and Shepodd in February 1958 when filming for the 19571958 season was completed.|$|E

[...] In July 1957, George Cleveland died unexpectedly, and {{producers}} were forced to overhaul the show. The plot was extensively reworked and Clayton and Rettig were dropped. Cloris Leachman and Jon Shepodd were quickly hired as Timmy’s foster parents Ruth and Paul Martin. In the fourth season, George Chandler was hired to play Petrie Martin, Paul's uncle, but was later dropped. As fourth season shooting progressed, Leachman grew unhappy playing a tired <b>farm</b> <b>woman,</b> feuded on-set with co-workers, and proved unpopular with viewers. Ratings dropped. When filming was completed for the 1957–58 season in February 1958, Wrather severed ties with producer Maxwell and dropped Leachman and Shepodd.

40|$|Abstract: While {{there is}} great {{variability}} across systems and socioeconomic contexts, women generally {{play a major role}} in managing and caring for animals, even when they are not the owners. They take active part in livestock farming similar to that of opposite gender. Hence, the present study was conducted in Tamil Nadu state of India to identify the information need perception of <b>farm</b> <b>women.</b> In this research, a total number of 100 rural women were selected through simple random sampling technique from five villages of Thiruvallur district of Tamilnadu. A questionnaire was built in consultation with extension specialists of the area to collect data. According to these findings, among the <b>farm</b> <b>women</b> respondents, majority (51. 00 per cent) of them had a low perception of information need followed by high (37. 00 per cent) and medium (12. 00 per cent) levels. <b>Farm</b> <b>women</b> respondents perceived more information requirement about farm credit, breeding, disease control, marketing, feeding and management in order. Further, this study revealed that only four characteristics of <b>farm</b> <b>women</b> viz., Occupation, Extension agency contact, Economic motivation and Social Participation were positively and significantly correlated with information need perception of <b>farm</b> <b>women...</b>|$|R

The feminist standpoint theory provided the framework for this study. A homogeneous, purposeful sample of 10 active dairy <b>farm</b> <b>women</b> were interviewed using individual, face to face, semistructured questions to answer the question: What are dairy <b>farm</b> <b>women</b> 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions of previous learning (education) and its influence on their primary, on-farm identity development? Emergent themes and patterns were identified following the in-depth data analysis process of interpretive phenomenological analysis.
