40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an estimate of}} the leak rate from the <b>emergency</b> <b>pump</b> well in L-basin that is to be expected during an off-normal event. This estimate is based on expected shrinkage of the engineered grout (i. e., controlled low strength material) used to fill the <b>emergency</b> <b>pump</b> well and the header pipes that provide the dominant leak path from the basin to the lower levels of the L-Area Complex. The estimate will be used to provide input into the operating safety basis to ensure that the water level in the basin will remain above a certain minimum level. The minimum basin water level is specified to ensure adequate shielding for personnel and maintain the ''as low as reasonably achievable'' concept of radiological exposure. The need for the leak rate estimation is the existence of a gap between the fill material and the header pipes, which penetrate the basin wall and would be the primary leak path {{in the event of a}} breach in those pipes. The gap between the pipe and fill material was estimated based on a full scale demonstration pour that was performed and examined. Leak tests were performed on full scale pipes as a part of this examination. Leak rates were measured to be on the order of 0. 01 gallons/minute for completely filled pipe (vertically positioned) and 0. 25 gallons/minute for partially filled pipe (horizontally positioned). This measurement was for water at 16 feet head pressure and with minimal corrosion or biofilm present.

40|$|Various pumping {{arrangements}} and their pressure profile control for forced cooling of long pipe type transmission lines were investigated. In order {{to overcome the}} extensive friction head losses and provide ample cable cooling, a number of pump stations has to be used. Since the inner line segments cannot be provided with pressure control head tanks, line blockages, flow resistance changes, flow rate changes, pump shutdowns, or other imbalances in one segment can alter the pressure profile along the entire line, and, when two head tanks are used, create transverse flow. Using experimental and analytical methods, {{it was determined that}} the pump - relief valve combination operating as a constant flow source is superior to the pump - relief valve combination operating as a constant pressure source, and that the configuration consisting of an even number of loops, each loop having the opposite flow direction from its neighbor's, is the best solution when operated with only one pressure control head tank. The simplest, and yet effective, line pressure profile control appears to be the pump bypass, which could be easily implemented on existing installations. The head tank pressure adjustment, however, is the most effective line pressure profile control scheme, and should be considered when a new system is being designed. From the analysis performed on an electric analogy model it was found, that the head tank pressure adjustment or the pump bypass would be sufficient to mainain the line pressure profile within its working limits for all practical imbalance sizes, and that, to extend the range of either of these line pressure profile controls, the <b>emergency</b> <b>pump</b> shutdown and the pump bypass itself should be based on the pump discharge, rather than the pump inlet pressure.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Implantable left {{ventricular}} assist devices are common {{as a bridge}} to transplantation but are just reaching their goal {{as an alternative to}} transplantation. Methods: From December 1991 until December 1996, 97 {{left ventricular}} assist devices were implanted as a bridge to transplantation, one as an alternative to transplantation, and two as a bridge to recovery. Included were 64 pneumatic devices and 36 electric devices. Most patients (69 %) had ischemic cardiomyopathy and most (53 %) had had previous cardiac surgery. Preoperative circulatory support (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) was used in 25. Results: Perioperative insertion of a right ventricular assist device was unusual (11 %). The mean duration of support with a left ventricular assist device (bridge to transplantation) was 70 ¬†¬± 41 days (up to 206 days). Survival to transplantation was 76 %. Cause of death included multiple organ failure (n¬†= 13), perioperative stroke (n¬†= 5), device failure (n¬†= 5), and controller disconnect (n¬†= 1). Significant risk factors for death included (1) preoperative need for ventilator or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, (2) elevated blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, or bilirubin, and (3) low pulmonary artery pressures. Risks after insertion of the left ventricular assist device were reoperation for bleeding, support with a right ventricular assist device, dialysis, or device failure. Catastrophic failure of the device occurred 14 times in 12 patients and was treated by <b>emergency</b> <b>pump</b> exchange in six instances. Only two device-related thromboembolic episodes were detected. Positive blood cultures were found in 59 % of patients, driveline infection in 28 %, and pump infection in 11 %. Conclusions: The HeartMate device provided excellent hemodynamic support with low device-related thromboembolic events. Infection and reliability of the device contributed to the high cost of therapy. These areas need to be improved for the left ventricular assist device to attain its goal as a viable alternative to transplantation. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998; 115 : 904 - 12...|$|E

25|$|The largest tsunami wave was 13 meters {{high and}} hit 50 {{minutes after the}} initial earthquake, {{overwhelming}} the plant's seawall, which was 10m high. The moment of impact was recorded by a camera. Water quickly flooded the low-lying rooms in which the emergency generators were housed.

These pumps needed to continuously circulate coolant water through a Generation II reactor for several days to keep the fuel rods from melting, as the fuel rods continued to generate decay heat after the SCRAM event. The fuel rods would become hot enough to melt during the fuel decay time period if an adequate heat sink was not available.

40|$|A jet pump, in {{combination}} with a TEMP, is employed to assure safe cooling of a nuclear reactor after shutdown. A TEMP, responsive to {{the heat from the}} coolant in the secondary flow path, automatically pumps the withdrawn coolant to a higher pressure and thus higher velocity compared to the main flow. The high velocity coolant is applied as a driver flow for the jet pump which has a main flow chamber located in the main flow circulation pump. Upon nuclear shutdown and loss of power for the main reactor pumping system, the TEMP/jet pump combination continues to boost the coolant flow in the direction it is already circulating. During the decay time for the nuclear reactor, the jet pump keeps running until the coolant temperature drops to a lower and safe temperature. At this lower temperature, the TEMP/jet jump combination ceases its circulation boosting operation. The TEMP/jet pump combination is automatic, self-regulating and provides an <b>emergency</b> <b>pumping</b> system free of moving parts...|$|R

50|$|A similar {{situation}} {{occurred during the}} Chernobyl disaster: after the reactor was destroyed and began to burn, a liquid corium mass from the melting core began to breach the concrete floor of the reactor vessel, which was situated above the bubbler pool (a large water reservoir for <b>emergency</b> <b>pumps,</b> also designed to safely contain steam pipe ruptures). The RBMK had no allowance or planning for core meltdowns, and the imminent interaction of the core mass with the bubbler pool would have produced a massive steam explosion, likely destroying the entire plant (vastly increasing the spread and magnitude of the radioactive plume). It was therefore necessary to drain the bubbler pool before the corium reached it. However, the initial explosion had broken the control circuitry which allowed the pool to be emptied. Three volunteer divers were required to manually operate the valves necessary to drain this pool, and later images of the corium mass in the pipes of the bubbler pool's basement reinforced the heroic necessity of their actions.|$|R
