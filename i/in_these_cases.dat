5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>cases,</b> some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E
5|$|A mosaic {{mutation}} {{may or may}} not be inheritable, {{depending on}} the cell populations affected. Though this is not always the case, genetic mutations can occur spontaneously in one sex cell of a parent during gametogenesis. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>cases,</b> called germline mutations, the mutation will be present in the single-celled zygote conceived from the affected sperm or egg cell, and the condition can be inherited by the next generation.|$|E

5|$|Because PGAD is {{relatively}} rare and, {{as its own}} concept apart from clitoral priapism, has only been researched since 2001, there is little research into what may cure or remedy the disorder.

5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative negligence <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>cases,</b> wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if {{there are others who}} are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen is not {{an energy}} resource, except in the {{hypothetical}} context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium, a technology presently far from development. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources requires more energy to make than is obtained by burning it, so <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>cases</b> hydrogen functions as an energy carrier, like a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable.|$|E
5|$|In some serpins, the S to R {{transition}} can activate {{cell signalling}} events. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>cases,</b> a serpin that {{has formed a}} complex with its target protease, is then recognised by a receptor. The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor. The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells {{to the presence of}} protease activity. This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade.|$|E

5|$|RNAi in vivo {{delivery}} to tissues still eludes science—especially to tissues {{deep within the}} body. RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract. In these instances, siRNA {{has been used in}} direct contact with the tissue for transport. The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes. When delivering siRNA to deep tissues, the siRNA must be protected from nucleases, but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty. This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached, however <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>cases</b> hepatotoxicity was reported.|$|E
5|$|Some {{photovoltaic}} systems, such as rooftop installations, {{can supply}} power directly to an electricity user. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>cases,</b> the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price {{at which the}} user pays for his electricity consumption. This situation is sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'. Research carried out by UN-Energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.|$|E
