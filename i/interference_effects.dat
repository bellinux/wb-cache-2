25|$|Wheeler's {{version of}} the double-slit {{experiment}} is arranged so that the same photon that emerges from two slits can be detected in two ways. The first way lets the two paths come together, lets the two copies of the wavefunction overlap, and shows interference. The second way moves {{farther away from the}} photon source to a position where the distance between the two copies of the wavefunction is too great to show <b>interference</b> <b>effects.</b> The technical problem in the laboratory is how to insert a detector screen at a point appropriate to observe <b>interference</b> <b>effects</b> or to remove that screen to reveal the photon detectors that can be restricted to receiving photons from the narrow regions of space where the slits are found. One way to accomplish that task would be to use the recently developed electrically switchable mirrors and simply change directions of the two paths from the slits by switching a mirror on or off.

25|$|Thin-film linear polarizers are glass {{substrates}} {{on which}} a special optical coating is applied. Either Brewster's angle reflections or <b>interference</b> <b>effects</b> in the film cause them to act as beam-splitting polarizers. The substrate for the film can either be a plate, which is inserted into the beam at a particular angle, or a wedge of glass that is cemented to a second wedge to form a cube with the film cutting diagonally across the center (one form {{of this is the}} very common MacNeille cube).|$|E
25|$|Since the Huygens–Fresnel {{principle}} {{states that}} every {{point of a}} wavefront {{is associated with the}} production of a new disturbance, it is possible for a wavefront to interfere with itself constructively or destructively at different locations producing bright and dark fringes in regular and predictable patterns. Interferometry is the science of measuring these patterns, usually as a means of making precise determinations of distances or angular resolutions.

25|$|The {{appearance}} of thin films and coatings is {{directly affected by}} <b>interference</b> <b>effects.</b> Antireflective coatings use destructive interference to reduce the reflectivity of the surfaces they coat, {{and can be used}} to minimise glare and unwanted reflections. The simplest case is a single layer with thickness one-fourth the wavelength of incident light. The reflected wave {{from the top of the}} film and the reflected wave from the film/material interface are then exactly 180° out of phase, causing destructive interference. The waves are only exactly out of phase for one wavelength, which would typically be chosen to be near the centre of the visible spectrum, around 550nm. More complex designs using multiple layers can achieve low reflectivity over a broad band, or extremely low reflectivity at a single wavelength.|$|E

40|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{integration of}} both endurance and resistance exercise (RE) into a periodised training regime is termed concurrent training. As both exercise modes promote adaptations at both whole-body and skeletal muscle levels that improve oxidative {{as well as}} functional capacity, concurrent training is an attractive exercise strategy for improving markers of cardiometabolic health and athletic performance. Since the classic work of Hickson (1980), numerous investigations have shown that concurrent training, relative to resistance training (RT) performed alone, can attenuate improvements in maximal strength, hypertrophy, and indices of power development, with no negative impact on V̇O 2 max. This has been variously described as the <b>interference</b> <b>effect</b> or concurrent training effect. Despite {{the majority of the}} literature supporting the existence of the <b>interference</b> <b>effect,</b> some studies have not observed any evidence of an <b>interference</b> <b>effect,</b> or rather that some adaptations may be more susceptible to interference than others.

[...] Light incident at a given point in the space downstream of the slit is made up of contributions from each of these point sources and if the relative phases of these contributions vary by 2π or more, we may expect to find minima and maxima in the diffracted light.
