50|$|The {{total number}} of {{skeletal}} muscle fibers has traditionally been thought not to change.It is believed there are no sex or age differences in <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution,</b> however, relative fiber types vary considerably from muscle to muscle and person to person.Sedentary men and women (as well as young children) have 45% type II and 55% type I fibers.People at the higher end of any sport tend to demonstrate patterns of <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> e.g. endurance athletes show {{a higher level of}} type I fibers.Sprint athletes, on the other hand, require large numbers of type IIX fibers.Middle distance event athletes show approximately equal distribution of the two types. This is also often the case for power athletes such as throwers and jumpers.It has been suggested that various types of exercise can induce changes in the fibers of a skeletal muscle.It is thought that if you perform endurance type events for a sustained period of time, some of the type IIX fibers transform into type IIA fibers. However, there is no consensus on the subject.It may well be that the type IIX fibers show enhancements of the oxidative capacity after high intensity endurance training which brings them to a level at which they are able to perform oxidative metabolism as effectively as slow twitch fibers of untrained subjects. This would be brought about by an increase in mitochondrial size and number and the associated related changes not a change in fiber type.|$|E

The subjects were eight crewmembers, three from a 5-day mission and five from an 11-day mission. Biopsies of the mid-portion of the m. vastus lateralis were obtained {{by means of a}} 6-mm biopsy needle with suction assist.

40|$|The {{spinning}} triangle is {{a critical}} region in the spinning process of yarn. Its geometry influences the <b>fiber</b> tension <b>distribution</b> and thus affects the properties of spun yarns. In conventional ring spinning, on the one hand, the spinning triangles are often asymmetric due to the frictional contacts of fibers with the bottom roller, which interferes with the twist propagation into the spinning triangle zone, and thus leads to the migration of the axis fiber at the front roller nip. On the other hand, the yarn spinning tension has an obvious angle with the vertical axis perpendicular to the nip line. Therefore, in this paper, a theoretical model of the <b>fiber</b> tension <b>distributions</b> in the general spinning triangle has been proposed by considering both the inclination angle of the spinning tension and the migration of the axis fiber at the front roller nip according {{to the principle of}} minimum potential energy. Two shape parameters were introduced to describe the skew level of the geometry of the spinning triangle in the analysis. The effects of shapes of the spinning triangle on the <b>fiber</b> tension <b>distributions</b> were investigated. The results show that the <b>fiber</b> tension <b>distribution</b> at the spinning triangle tends to more non-uniformity with increasing the asymmetry of the spinning triangle. The effects of both shape par-ameters on the <b>fiber</b> tension <b>distributions</b> are similar under the assumption that the spinning triangle height H is constant. In addition, a more long-narrow shape of the spinning triangle shows more uniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distributions.</b> Keyword...|$|R

Mean values did not reflect the considerable variation seen in the biopsies from the eight astronauts who participated. At least some of this variation likely resulted from differences in the types and quantities of preflight and in-flight countermeasures (exercise or LBNP) used by the different crewmembers. The relative proportions of Type I and Type II fibers were different {{before and after the}} 11 day mission: the <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> also seemed to follow the same trend after the 5 day mission (more Type II and fewer Type I fibers after than before), but the sample size was too small to reach statistical significance.

40|$|Engineered {{cementitious}} composites (ECC) is {{a class of}} ultra ductile fiber reinforced {{cementitious composites}}, characterized by high ductility and tight crack width control. The polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fiber with a diameter of 39 lm and a length of 6 - 12 mm is often used. Unlike plain concrete and normal fiber reinforced concrete, ECC shows a strain-hardening behavior under tensile load. Apart from the mix design, the <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> is another crucial factor for the mechanical properties of ECC, especially the ductility. In order to obtain a good <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution,</b> the plastic viscosity of the ECC mortar before adding fibers needs to be controlled, for example, by adjusting water-to-powder ratio or chemical admixtures. However, such adjustments have some limitations and may result in poor mechanical properties of ECC. This research explores an innovative approach to improve the <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> by adjusting the mixing sequence. With the standard mixing sequence, fibers are added after all solid and liquid materials are mixed. The undesirable plastic viscosity before the fiber addition may cause poor <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> and results in poor hardened properties. With the adjusted mixing sequence, the mix of solid materials with the liquid material {{is divided into two}} steps and the addition of fibers is between the two steps. In this paper, the influence of different water mixing sequences is investigated by comparing the experimental results of the uniaxial tensile test and the <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> analysis. Compared with the standard mixing sequence, the adjusted mixing sequence increases the tensile strain capacity and ultimate tensile strength of ECC and improves the <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution.</b> This concept is further applied in the development of ECC with high volume of sand...|$|E

40|$|Two micromechanical {{models were}} {{developed}} to investigate the thermal expansion of graphite/copper (Gr/Cu) composites. The models incorporate the effects of temperature-dependent material properties, matrix inelasticity, initial residual stresses due to processing history, and nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution.</b> The first model {{is based on the}} multiple concentric cylinder geometry, with each cylinder treated as a two-phase composite with a characteristic fiber volume fractions. By altering the fiber volume fraction of the individual cylinders, unidirectional composites with radially nonuniform fiber distributions can be investigated using this model. The second model is based on the inelastic lamination theory. By varying the fiber content in the individual laminae, composites with nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> in the thickness direction can be investigated. In both models, the properties of the individual regions (cylinders or laminae) are calculated using the method of cells micromechanical model. Classical incremental plasticity theory is used to model the inelastic response of the copper matrix at the microlevel. The models were used to characterize the effects of nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> on the thermal expansion of Gr/Cu. These effects were compared to the effects of matrix plasticity, choice of stress-free temperature, and slight fiber misalignment. It was found that the radially nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> has little effect on the thermal expansion of Gr/Cu but could become significant for composites with large fiber-matrix transverse CTE and Young's modulus mismatch. The effect of nonuniform <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> in the through-thickness direction of a laminate was more significant, but only approached that of the stress-free temperature for the most extreme cases that include large amounts of bending. Subsequent comparison with experimental thermal expansion data indicated the need for more accurate characterization of the graphite fiber thermomechanical properties. Correlation with cyclic data revealed the presence of a mechanism not considered in the developed models. The predicted response did, however, exhibit ratcheting behavior that has been observed experimentally in Gr/Cu. Finally, simulation of the actual <b>fiber</b> <b>distribution</b> of particular specimens had little effect on the predicted thermal expansion...|$|E
