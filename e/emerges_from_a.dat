5|$|In the DVD commentary, Matt Groening {{notes that}} {{beginning}} any television series is difficult, {{but he found}} particular difficulty starting one {{that took place in}} the future because of the amount of setup required. As a trade off, they included a lot of Easter eggs in the episode that would pay off in later episodes. He and Cohen point these out throughout the episode. The scene where Fry <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> cryonic tube and has his first view of New New York was the first 3D scene worked on by the animation team. It was considered to be a defining point for whether the technique would work or not.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are social}} insects; {{a large number}} of species are either gregarious or {{inclined}} to aggregate, and a slightly smaller number exhibit parental care. It used to be thought that cockroaches aggregated because they were reacting to environmental cues, but it is now believed that pheromones are involved in these behaviors. Some species secrete these in their feces with gut microbial symbionts being involved, while others use glands located on their mandibles. Pheromones produced by the cuticle may enable cockroaches to distinguish between different populations of cockroach by odor. The behaviors involved have only been studied in a few species, but German cockroaches leave fecal trails with an odor gradient. Other cockroaches follow such trails to discover sources of food and water, and where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches have emergent behavior, in which group or swarm behavior <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> simple set of individual interactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{beginnings}} of Bowie's acting career predate his commercial breakthrough as a musician. Studying avant-garde theatre and mime under Lindsay Kemp, {{he was given}} the role of Cloud in Kemp's 1967 theatrical production Pierrot in Turquoise (later made into the 1970 television film The Looking Glass Murders). In the black-and-white short The Image (1969), he played a ghostly boy who <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> troubled artist's painting to haunt him. The same year, the film of Leslie Thomas's 1966 comic novel The Virgin Soldiers saw Bowie make a brief appearance as an extra. In 1976 he earned acclaim for his first major film role, portraying Thomas Jerome Newton, an alien from a dying planet, in The Man Who Fell to Earth, directed by Nicolas Roeg. Just a Gigolo (1979), an Anglo-German co-production directed by David Hemmings, saw Bowie in the lead role as Prussian officer Paul von Przygodski, who, returning from World War I, is discovered by a Baroness (Marlene Dietrich) and put into her Gigolo Stable.|$|E

5|$|The small burns {{that are}} tributaries to the East Burn {{contributed to the}} {{draining}} of the lands of Dunnikier Estate. The burn <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> deep-set culvert to flow under the Victoria Viaduct, down a deep gorge, through the site of Hutchison's Flour Mills before running parallel to the harbour wall and into the sea. From the mid-19th century, the Hutchison's buildings became a significant landmark adjacent to the burn. The flour millers chose this area for its railway connection which linked the main station to the harbour, rather than for the {{need to use the}} burn to power the mills. The West (or Tiel) Burn, was also important, providing power for textile mills. This burn flowed out of the Raith Estate lands where scenically and recreationally it was used to create Raith Lake (with its tributary, the Dronachy Burn). The mill owners in Linktown also made use of the burn.|$|E

25|$|Similar to ants, {{cockroaches}} leave chemical {{trails in}} their faeces {{as well as}} emitting airborne pheromones for swarming and mating. Other cockroaches will follow these trails to discover sources of food and water, and also discover where other cockroaches are hiding. Thus, cockroaches can exhibit emergent behaviour, in which group or swarm behaviour <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> simple set of individual interactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{worship of}} Mithras was {{widespread}} {{in much of}} the Roman Empire from the mid-2nd century CE. The Mithra cult in the Roman Empire was a syncretism of different religious motifs, centered on the god Mithras who <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> rock. Its closest similarities to Christianity are the story of the slaying of the bull by Mithras; a bull is captured and killed by Mithras when he plunges a knife into it and from the dead bull grain and plants are produced, that symbolize life. Mithras was a solar deity, closely associated with the Roman Sol Invictus.|$|E

25|$|Most of Smith's {{stories are}} set in an era {{starting}} some 14,000 years in the future. The Instrumentality of Mankind rules Earth {{and goes on to}} control other planets later inhabited by humanity. The Instrumentality attempts to revive old cultures and languages in a process known as the Rediscovery of Man. This rediscovery {{can be seen as the}} initial period when humankind <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> mundane utopia and the nonhuman Underpeople gain freedom from slavery. It may also be viewed as part of a continuing process begun by the Instrumentality, encompassing the whole cycle, where mankind is constantly at risk of falling back into bad old ways.|$|E
25|$|Eddie and {{his friends}} enter the carnival, and Eddie sees Jake coming in as well. Eddie leaves to find Jake. Joey sees a man who he's {{had a crush on}} for weeks {{entering}} one of the dance venues. Chaz encourages Joey to talk to the man, but when he does Joey is cruelly turned down. Chaz goes to the restroom with Joey to console him, then waits for Joey outside. Chaz takes ecstasy and leaves when he sees a good-looking man walk past. Joey's crush comes into the bathroom and apologizes, leaving Joey ecstatically happy.

However, Krusty mistakenly takes her to West Springfield Elementary School. Lisa leaves the school and, needing a ride, stops at Moe's Tavern looking for her dad, {{but he is not}} there. Homer comes in just as she is leaving by the back door. Outside, Lisa finds Marge, who tries to take her to school, but the car runs out of gas. Marge and Lisa see Cletus' truck and hitch a ride, but when he exits his truck they steal it and drive off for the school themselves.

25|$|The {{motif of}} the hand, with no body attached, {{provides}} {{a problem for}} the artist in how to terminate it. In Christian narrative images the hand most often <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> small cloud, at or {{near the top of the}} image, but in iconic contexts it may appear cut off in the picture space, or spring from a border, or a victor's wreath (left). A cloud is mentioned as the source of the voice of God in the gospel accounts of the Transfiguration of Jesus (see below). Several of the examples in the Dura Europos synagogue (see below) show a good part of the forearm as well as the hand, which is not found in surviving Christian examples, and most show an open palm, sometimes with the fingers spread out. Later examples in Jewish art are closer in form to Christian styles.|$|E
25|$|In 9:41, the mage-templar war is {{temporarily}} halted {{during the}} Conclave, {{a peace conference}} orchestrated by Divine Justinia. During the negotiations, an explosion destroys the Conclave, killing the Divine and many senior Chantry clerics, along with many mages and templars, and creates the Breach, a massive hole in the Veil, the magical boundary between the physical world and the Fade, the world of spirits. The only survivor of the blast is the player character, who <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> rift with a mark on their hand capable of closing the rifts {{that have sprung up}} in the Breach's wake, but no memory of what happened. After assisting Cassandra in closing several rifts, the player character begins to be referred to as the Herald of Andraste. With the Chantry leaderless, Cassandra and Leliana carry out one of the Divine's last orders and re-establish the Inquisition, the organization that predated the Chantry, in order to address the crisis, close the Breach, and defeat the one who created it.|$|E
25|$|On Apokolips, Darkseid and Desaad {{discuss the}} coming of a time with {{existence}} being recreated with Darkseid as the architect. Darkseid has {{what appears to be}} a chess-board with pieces representing the Joker, Donna Troy, Green Arrow, the Flash, Holly Robinson, Batman, Jason Todd, Hawkman, Killer Croc, Martian Manhunter, Superman, Wonder Woman, OMAC, Jimmy Olsen, Nightwing, Duela Dent, and Black Adam. Later, as the New Gods Lightray and Sleez are killed by an unknown, mysterious figure, Darkseid converses with a concubine and Desaad. When the concubine comments on Darkseid showing a moment of weakness, Darkseid kills her and tells Desaad to remove the vocal cords from the next concubine. The conversation is witnessed by Forager of New Genesis, who is spying on them to see if Darkseid is responsible for the recent murders of the New Gods. Forager is attacked by a guard and escapes. The Deep Six are killed soon afterwards by the same mysterious figure. Darkseid shows knowledge of the New Gods dying across the galaxy and the mystery figure killing them, and decides to use the New Gods as pawns in a complex scheme intended to result in his rule of the entire Multiverse. Mary Marvel is brought before Darkseid, who tells her that he wants a sorcerer and that she is it. When she refuses his offer, they briefly fight before Desaad arrives and distracts Darkseid long enough for Mary to escape. Eclipso assures Darkseid that she will bring Mary back. Darkseid later restores Mary's powers and orders her to capture Jimmy Olsen. Later, Darkseid is about to siphon Jimmy's superpowers out of him before his son Orion <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> boom tube and apparently kills him after ripping his heart out. The Monitor Solomon places a chess piece of Darkseid onto the Source Wall as a memento of his victory.|$|E

25|$|When a {{honey bee}} swarm <b>emerges</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> hive {{they do not}} fly far at first. They may gather in a tree or on a branch only a few meters from the hive. In this new location, the bees cluster about the queen and send 20 -50 scout bees out to find a {{suitable}} new nest locations.The scout bees are the most experienced foragers in the cluster. An individual scout returning to the cluster promotes a location she has found. She uses a dance similar to the waggle dance to indicate direction and distance {{to others in the}} cluster. The more excited she is about her findings the more excitedly she dances. If she can convince other scouts to check out the location she found, they may take off, check out the proposed site and promote the site further upon their return. Several different sites may be promoted by different scouts at first. After several hours and sometimes days, slowly a favourite location emerges from this decision making process. When all scouts agree on a final location the whole cluster takes off and flies to it. Sometimes, if no decision is reached, the swarm will separate, some bees going in one direction; others, going in another. This usually results in failure, with both groups dying. A swarm may fly for a kilometre or more to the scouted out location, though some species may establish new colonies within as little as 500 meters from the natal nest, such as Apis dorsata. This collective decision making process is remarkably successful in identifying the most suitable new nest site and keeping the swarm intact. A good nest site has to be large enough to accommodate the swarm (about 15 litres in volume), has to be well protected from the elements, receive a certain amount of warmth from the sun, be some height above the ground, have a small entrance and resist the infestation of ants - hence why trees are often selected.|$|E
