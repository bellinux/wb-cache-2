5|$|The {{battle is}} noted {{as the most}} {{significant}} defeat for the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. Not only had four frigates been lost with their entire crews, but 105 experienced sailors had been killed and 168 wounded {{in one of the}} bloodiest frigate encounters of the war. French losses were also <b>heavy,</b> <b>with</b> Duperré reporting 36 killed and 112 wounded on his squadron and among the soldiers firing from the shore.|$|E
5|$|The {{church of}} Hagia Sophia in the Empire of Trebizond dates to between 1238 and 1263 {{and has a}} {{variation}} on the quincunx plan. <b>Heavy</b> <b>with</b> traditional detailing from Asia Minor, and possibly Armenian or Georgian influence, the brick pendentives and drum of the dome remain Byzantine.|$|E

5|$|At 08:45 Rivoli, {{which had}} been {{struggling}} to reach the harbour of Trieste, lost her mizzenmast under fire from both Victorious and Weasel. Nearly at the same moment, two of her 36-pounder long guns exploded, killing or wounding 60 men, greatly disorganising and demoralising the others, and forcing Barré to transfer gunners from the upper gun deck to man his lower battery. Fifteen minutes later, with his ship unmanageable and battered, Commodore Barré surrendered. Rivoli had suffered over 400 killed and wounded from her crew of over 800, who had only assembled {{for the first time}} a few days before and had never sailed their ship in open water. Losses aboard Victorious were also <b>heavy,</b> <b>with</b> one officer and 25 sailors and marines killed and six officers (including Captain Talbot) and 93 men wounded.|$|E
5|$|Beauregard's {{decision}} {{was one of}} the most controversial of the Civil War. Numerous veterans and historians have wondered what might have happened if the assault had gone forward into the night. Beauregard believed that the battle was essentially won and his men could finish off Grant in the morning. He knew the terrain to be crossed (a steep ravine containing a creek named Dill Branch) was extremely difficult and Grant's defensive line was <b>heavy</b> <b>with</b> massed artillery and supported by gunboats in the river. Unbeknownst to Beauregard, Buell's Army of the Ohio began arriving that afternoon, and he and Grant launched a massive counterattack on April 7. Overwhelmed, the Confederates retreated to Corinth.|$|E
5|$|Between January and March 1916, Townshend {{launched}} several {{attacks in}} an attempt to lift the siege. In sequence, the attacks took place at the Battle of Sheikh Sa'ad, the Battle of the Wadi, the Battle of Hanna, and the Battle of Dujaila Redoubt. These attempts to break through the encirclement did not succeed and the cost was <b>heavy</b> <b>with</b> both sides suffering high casualties. In February food, and hopes were running out for Townshend in Kut-al-Amara. Disease spread rapidly and could not be contained or cured and Townshend surrendered in April 1916. In December 1916, the 3rd and 7th Divisions arrived from the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|Near its {{landfall}} location, Charley destroyed 290 of the 300houses in the village, while over 70,000homes in Havana {{were either}} damaged or destroyed. Numerous hotels reported damage, potentially impacting the important tourism {{industry in the}} country. Agricultural damage was <b>heavy,</b> <b>with</b> the hurricane damaging more than 3,000 agricultural institutions. Citrus officials estimated a loss of 15,000metric tons of grapefruit on the Isle of Youth, while strong winds ruined 66,000metric tons of citrus trees in the Havana area. Charley also destroyed around 57,000acres (230km²) of fruit trees in the Havana area. Approximately 95% of the sugar cane, bean, and banana crops were affected in Cuban territory. In all, Charley was directly responsible for four deaths in Cuba, and was responsible for $923million in property damage, primarily from agricultural losses.|$|E
5|$|The French victory {{had come}} at a heavy cost: more than 160 men were killed and 300 wounded and all three French ships had been {{severely}} damaged. Among the dead were the captains of both Formidable and Indomptable, although Linois was unhurt. The Spanish had suffered eleven men killed and five gunboats had been destroyed. The batteries and town had also been badly damaged in the fighting. British losses were also <b>heavy,</b> <b>with</b> more than 130 killed and more than 230 wounded, most {{of which had been}} lost on Hannibal and Pompée. In addition to the loss of Hannibal, Pompée was severely damaged and the remainder of the British squadron all required urgent repairs.|$|E
5|$|The Oaks {{finished}} second in the league behind the Seals in 1946, winning {{the first round of the}} playoffs against Los Angeles before losing to San Francisco in the finals. They finished fourth in 1947, beating San Francisco in the first round before losing to Los Angeles. Stengel managed the Oaks for a third year in 1948, with the roster <b>heavy</b> <b>with</b> former major leaguers. Among the younger players on the team was 20-year-old shortstop Billy Martin. Stengel was impressed by Martin's fielding, baseball acuity, and, when there were brawls on the field, fighting ability. The Oaks clinched the pennant on September 26, and defeated Los Angeles and the Seattle Rainiers to win the Governors' Cup. The Sporting News named Stengel the Minor League Manager of the Year.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the battle was inconclusive, both squadrons retiring with one ship damaged apiece. French losses had been <b>heavy,</b> <b>with</b> 15 killed and 20 wounded on Prudente, the latter including Renaud and 22 killed and 62 wounded on Cybèle. One sailor was killed and five wounded on Jean-Bart and no casualties were reported on Courier. By contrast, Centurion had only three men killed and 23 wounded and Diomede none at all, but the damage to Osborne's ship was more problematic; while Renaud could repair and resupply his ships in nearby Port Louis, Centurion {{had to return to}} India, several thousand miles away, to affect repairs. Osborne was thus forced to abandon the blockade, with Centurion sailing to Bombay and Diomede to Madras.|$|E
5|$|The race's {{penultimate}} day {{of racing}} {{was scheduled to}} go from Bari to Naples. During the stage, Lucien Petit-Breton crashed {{and was forced to}} abandon the race. The route had the riders go through rough roads that were <b>heavy</b> <b>with</b> dust and occasional passed over streams, thus flooding the roads. The riders were also chase by enraged buffalo. All of those factors caused the riders to end the stage a few kilometers short of Naples, in Pompeii with Alfredo Sivocci winning the day. The last stage ended back in Rome, where the race began. Ezio Corlaita took his second stage win as 24 riders that began the Giro finished the day. Bianchi's Carlo Galetti became the first rider to win two editions of the Giro d'Italia.|$|E
5|$|The voice cast was <b>heavy</b> <b>with</b> {{television}} situation-comedy {{stars of}} the time: Flik was voiced by Dave Foley (from NewsRadio), Princess Atta was voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (from Seinfeld), Molt was voiced by Richard Kind (from Spin City), Slim was voiced by David Hyde Pierce (from Frasier) and Dim was voiced by Brad Garrett (from Everybody Loves Raymond). Joe Ranft, member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar {{at the suggestion of}} Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track.|$|E

5|$|Tirpitz was {{rendered}} {{unfit for}} combat by Operation Paravane. The Tallboy bomb that struck the battleship {{passed through the}} foredeck and hull, and exploded in the water on the starboard side of her bow. This damage wrecked the bow, and left the battleship's forward compartments flooded with 2,000 tons of water. The explosions of several other Tallboys in the water near Tirpitz also buckled some of her hull plates and bulkheads. The battleship's casualties were not <b>heavy,</b> <b>with</b> five men killed and fifteen wounded. The damage was assessed as needing nine months' worth of work to repair. After reporting on the damage, Tirpitzs commanding officer, Kapitän zur See Wolf Junge, recommended to the German Navy's high command that the battleship be removed from service.|$|E
5|$|When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, its armored corps was {{composed}} of 1,445 Panzer Is, 1,223 Panzer IIs, 98 Panzer IIIs and 211 Panzer IVs; the more modern vehicles amounted to less than 10% of Germany's armored strength. The 1st Panzer Division had a roughly equal balance of types, with 17 Panzer Is, 18 Panzer IIs, 28 Panzer IIIs, and 14 Panzer IVs per battalion. The remaining panzer divisions were <b>heavy</b> <b>with</b> obsolete models, equipped as they were with 34 Panzer Is, 33 Panzer IIs, 5 Panzer IIIs, and 6 Panzer IVs per battalion. Although the Polish Army possessed less than 200 tanks capable of penetrating the German light tanks, Polish anti-tank guns proved more of a threat, reinforcing German faith {{in the value of}} the close-support Panzer IV.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of A Bug's Life, a public feud erupted between DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Pixar's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation. After DreamWorks' acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)—long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation—Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed {{to learn from the}} trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz. By this time, Pixar's project was well-known within the animation community. Both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a young male, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas A Bug's Life relied chiefly on visual gags, Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of Antz was also <b>heavy</b> <b>with</b> adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.|$|E
50|$|The Air Force BQM-34F was {{slightly}} <b>heavier,</b> <b>with</b> an additional parachute for midair recovery by helicopter snatch. The Navy BQM-34E was updated with improved avionics in the mid-1970s, with the upgrade redesignated BQM-34T.|$|R
50|$|Twelve {{isotopes}} of lawrencium {{plus one}} isomer have been synthesized with 266Lr being the longest-lived and the <b>heaviest,</b> <b>with</b> a half-life of 11 hours. 252Lr is the lightest isotope of lawrencium {{to be produced}} to date.|$|R

5|$|There {{are three}} unique Titan classes, {{variants}} of light, medium, and <b>heavy,</b> <b>with</b> inversely related speed and armor: the all-rounder Atlas, the bulky Ogre, and the fleet-footed Stryder. The latter two chassis are unlocked upon finishing both faction campaigns and were later made unlockable by leveling up as well. Each chassis has a respective Core power that {{works on a}} cooldown timer: respectively, increased damage, increased shields, and unlimited dashes. Titan tactical ability options include stopping enemy ammunition in midair to throw back in their direction, emitting electrified smoke to hurt and repel pilots climbing the Titan's back, and deploying a defensive wall. Additionally, players can equip two perk kits to customize for their preferred strategy. Their primary weapons include rocket launchers, lightning cannons, and chainguns. Titans can act autonomously when put in guard and follow modes, which directs the Titan either to protect their vicinity or to tail their pilot, respectively.|$|E
5|$|With Troubridge in pursuit, the Dutch {{merchant}} {{ships were}} unable to escape Harrier, and at 06:30 Victoria surrendered. Sending a boat to take possession, Troubridge immediately turned away towards Batavier. Elphinstone too was sailing towards the isolated merchant vessel and at 06:40 Captain De Val surrendered rather than fight the superior British force. William successfully escaped {{in the aftermath of}} the battle, rapidly outdistancing a weak chase from the battered Harrier. All three captured ships were taken over by prize crews and brought to Port Cornwallis on South Andaman Island. Casualties on Pallas were <b>heavy,</b> <b>with</b> eight men killed outright and 32 wounded, including Aalbers and three of his lieutenants. Six of the wounded later died, including the Dutch captain. There were also four men killed on the East Indiamen and seven wounded, one of whom died later. British losses by contrast were light, with one man killed and eight wounded on Greyhound and just three wounded on Harrier.|$|E
5|$|With the {{surrender}} of Fort Desaix, British forces solidified their occupation of the island of Martinique. The remaining shipping and military supplies were seized and the regular soldiers of the garrison taken as prisoners of war. The militia were disbanded and Martinique became a British colony, remaining under British command until {{the restoration of the}} French monarchy in 1814, when it was returned to French control. British losses in the campaign were <b>heavy,</b> <b>with</b> 97 killed, 365 wounded and 18 missing. French total losses are uncertain but the garrison suffered at least 900 casualties, principally in the fighting in the central highlands on 1 and 2 February and during the siege of Fort Desaix. Upon his return to France, Villaret's conduct was condemned by an inquiry council; he requested in vain a Court-martial to clear his name, and lived in disgrace for two years.|$|E
2500|$|A {{side-by-side}} {{version was}} also built and designated the Potez VIII R; {{it was a}} little <b>heavier,</b> <b>with</b> a wider fuselage and powered by a fully cowled [...] Le Rhone 9C engine. It returned to the four wheel undercarriage.|$|R
