25|$|In {{respect to}} the other {{non-lethal}} weapon effects from an IND detonated {{on or near the}} surface, the detonation's blast wave would likely produce a momentary electric grid blackout due to the loss of a large portion of a city's electrical equipment drawing power/electrical load, while the electromagnetic pulse(EMP) from a surface/ground-burst explosion would cause little damage outside the blast area, so cell phone towers that survive the blast should be capable of carrying communications. Although if communications during the 9/11 attacks or after a major hurricane are anything to <b>go</b> <b>by,</b> <b>and</b> the cell phone network towers survive, the service would be overloaded(a Mass call event) and thereby made useless soon after; however, if prior arrangements between the cell network and emergency responders are made to give them priority and bar access to all other individuals, then it may be an effective service. However, as Civil defense(CD) shelters, as depicted in the film, were stocked for such an eventuality, they contained amongst other things, at least one CDV-715 radiation survey meter and a CD emergency radio receiver which would respectively be used to facilitate a safe delayed evacuation, regardless of outside help and if communications continued, inform them of the outside situation as it developed.|$|E
25|$|Years <b>go</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> Rudolph {{has grown}} into adulthood. Returning home, he finds that his parents and Clarice {{have been looking for}} him for months. He sets out once again to find them, only to {{discover}} that they have been kidnapped by the Abominable Snow Monster. Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten, but the monster hits him {{in the head with a}} stalactite, dazing him. Later, Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph. Hermey, oinking like a pig, lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out. Hermey then pulls out all the monster's teeth. Realizing that the Abominable is now defenseless, Yukon drives the toothless monster back, only to fall over the cliff with all his pack dogs. Mourning Yukon's death, Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them. After hearing their story, Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown, promises that he'll find homes for the Misfit Toys, Hermey opens his own dentist's office, and Donner apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph. Yukon then returns with a reformed Abominable Snow Monster whom he hired to be a tree decorator. Christmas Eve comes and while everybody's celebrating, Santa fears that he'll have to cancel Christmas if the storm doesn't let up. Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph's red nose and realizes that it's light could cut through the storm. He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees. The team then flies off to the island where the Misfit Toys to pick them up. The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night.|$|E

I let 50 years <b>go</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> see what's really relevant." [...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys. She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, [...] "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard for me and I love it and revere it and would not be doing what I do without the music of the Monroe Brothers, the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family.

[...] Before the shooting, Phil Anselmo made the statement [...] "Dimebag deserves to be severely beaten" [...] in the December 2004 edition of Metal Hammer. He denied making the comments and apologized, although Abbott requested Metal Hammer to provide the audio tapes to prove the authenticity of what Anselmo said. Abbott found the quote authentic and referred to him as the [...] "master of lies".|$|E

Sixty years <b>go</b> <b>by,</b> <b>and</b> who are we today? Are we better?" [...] He cited the Back to the Future trilogy as an influence, and claimed he had [...] "someone in mind to be the star, and definitely someone in mind to be the director". In February 2006, Arad hoped to have a summer 2008 theatrical release date. Jon Favreau approached Arad to direct the film as a comedy, but he chose to make Iron Man instead. In April 2006, David Self was hired to write the script. He explained that Captain America was his favorite superhero as a child because [...] "my dad told me I could one day be Captain America".

500|$|Away from acting, Hawke {{directed}} the music video for the 1994 song [...] "Stay (I Missed You)," [...] by singer-songwriter Lisa Loeb, {{who was a}} member of Hawke's theater company at the time. In a 2012 interview, Hawke said that the song, which was included in Reality Bites, is the only number-one popular song by an unsigned artist in the history of music. He published his first novel in 1996, The Hottest State, about a love affair between a young actor and a singer. Hawke said of the novel, [...] "Writing the book had to do with dropping out of college, and with being an actor. I didn't want my whole life to <b>go</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> not do anything but recite lines. I wanted to try making something else. It was definitely the scariest thing I ever did. And it was just one of the best things I ever did." [...] The book met with a mixed reception. Entertainment Weekly said that Hawke [...] "opens himself to rough literary scrutiny in The Hottest State. If Hawke is serious... he'd do well to work awhile in less exposed venues." [...] The New York Times thought Hawke did [...] "a fine job of showing what it's like to be young and full of confusion", concluding that The Hottest State was ultimately [...] "a sweet love story".|$|E

2500|$|Brando starred as Colonel Walter E. Kurtz in Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now (1979). He plays {{a highly}} {{decorated}} U.S. Army Special Forces officer who goes renegade, running his own operation based in Cambodia and is feared by the U.S. military {{as much as}} the Vietnamese. Brando was paid $1million a week for 3 weeks work. The film drew attention for its lengthy and troubled production, as Eleanor Coppola's documentary Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse documents: Brando showed up on the set overweight, Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack, and severe weather destroyed several expensive sets. The film's release was also postponed several times while Coppola edited millions of feet of footage. In the documentary, Coppola talks about how astonished he was when an overweight Brando turned up for his scenes and, feeling desperate, decided to portray Kurtz, who appears emaciated in the original story, as a man who had indulged every aspect of himself. Coppola: [...] "He was already heavy when I hired him and he promised me {{that he was going to}} get in shape and I imagined that I would, if he were heavy, I could use that. But he was so fat, he was very, very shy about it... He was very, very adamant about how he didn't want to portray himself that way." [...] Brando admitted to Coppola that he had not read the book, Heart of Darkness, as the director had asked him to, and the pair spent days exploring the story and the character of Kurtz, much to the actor's financial benefit, according to producer Fred Roos: [...] "The clock was ticking on this deal he had and we had to finish him within three weeks or we'd go into this very expensive overage... And Francis and Marlon would be talking about the character and whole days would <b>go</b> <b>by.</b> <b>And</b> this is at Marlon's urging—and yet he's getting paid for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jones married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. His first record, the self-penned [...] "No Money in This Deal", was {{recorded}} on January 19, and appeared in February on Starday Records, beginning the singer's association with producer and mentor H.W. [...] "Pappy" [...] Daily. The song was actually cut in Starday Records' co-founder Jack Starnes' {{living room and}} produced by Starnes. Jones also worked at KTRM (now KZZB) in Beaumont around this time. [...] Deejay Gordon Baxter told Nick Tosches that Jones acquired the nickname [...] "possum" [...] while working there: [...] "One of the deejays there, Slim Watts, took to calling him George P. Willicker Picklepuss Possum Jones. [...] For one thing, he cut his hair short, like a possum's belly. [...] He had a possum's nose and stupid eyes, like a possum." [...] During his early recording sessions, Daily admonished Jones for attempting to sound too much like his heroes Hank Williams and Lefty Frizzell. [...] In later years, Jones would have little good {{to say about the}} music production at Starday, recalling to NPR in 1996 that [...] "it was a terrible sound. [...] We recorded in a small living room of a house on a highway near Beaumont. [...] You could hear the trucks. [...] We had to stop a lot of times because it wasn't soundproof, it was just egg crates nailed on the wall and the big old semi trucks would <b>go</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> make a lot of noise and we'd have to start over again." [...] Jones' first hit came with [...] "Why Baby Why" [...] in 1955. [...] That same year, while touring as a cast member of the Louisiana Hayride, Jones met and played shows with Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. [...] "I didn't get to know him that well," [...] Jones said of Presley to Nick Tosches in 1994. [...] "He stayed pretty much with his friends around him in his dressing room. [...] Nobody seemed to get around him much any length of time to talk to him." [...] Jones would, however, remain a lifelong friend of Johnny Cash. [...] Jones was invited to sing at the Grand Ole Opry in 1956.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the season}} 6 premiere, it is {{discovered}} that the person whom Lucas called is Peyton. She goes {{to the airport and}} they hop on a plane to Vegas to get married. Once they get there, the chapel is too trashy, and so they do not get married. Instead, they drive to L.A. and Lucas proposes to her in the same hotel room he did years before. The two are still in L.A. during Brooke's attack. After Brooke calls Peyton and sounds weird, Lucas and Peyton decide to head back to Tree Hill and have the wedding there instead. Peyton sees that Brooke is beaten up, but Brooke lies and says she fell down the stairs, and Peyton believes her, not knowing that Brooke was attacked. Peyton meets a famous musician named Mick Wolf, who used to know Ellie. He is the one who asked Mia about Peyton during the tour. He keeps dodging around the subject of Peyton's real father, but says a little more about him each time Peyton brings him up. Peyton continues to get to know Mick and continues to ask about her real father. When she asks him why her parents gave her up and, he replies, [...] "We... I mean they, had a tough decision." [...] Mick accidentally lets the truth slip out, and suddenly Peyton realizes this is her father. She invites him over for a nice dinner together, he instead goes and gets drunk at a bar after being sober for a year (as shown by a sobriety chip in his pocket). She and Lucas have also set a date for their wedding, which causes conflict between Lucas and Lindsey with regards to the book tour for his second book. Peyton closes herself off emotionally with regard to Mick and is angry with him for not being upfront with her about who he is. She tells him to leave. Not long afterward, during a visit to Brooke's, Brooke tells Peyton the truth about how she got all the bruises on her body. Peyton is later seen on the phone with Larry, her adoptive father. She tells him how much she loves him. Though initially concerned about moving in together, Lucas and Peyton eventually decide to accept their differences and reside in the same house. Peyton reconnects with her biological brother Derek, who has returned from the war. Later, she goes to TRIC to meet up with Lucas and a guy named Julian, who is interested in making a movie out based on Lucas's first novel. Julian was asking Lucas {{a lot of questions about}} Peyton before she got there. She runs into Julian near the bathroom, and it is soon revealed that he is her ex-boyfriend. Three weeks <b>go</b> <b>by</b> <b>and</b> Peyton still has not told Lucas the truth about her romantic history with Julian. Lucas is left to discover their past on his own, and is initially angry about it. Peyton throws a USO concert in which Angels and Airwaves, Mia, and Haley play.
