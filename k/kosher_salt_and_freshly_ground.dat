5000|$|The kimmelweck roll (sometimes spelled [...] "kummelweck" [...] or [...] "kümmelweck"), {{topped with}} <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> caraway seeds, gives the {{sandwich}} its {{name and a}} distinctive taste. Kümmel is the German word for caraway, and weck means [...] "roll" [...] in the south-western German dialects of the Saarland, Baden and Swabia areas (northern Germans generally say brötchen). However, the roll used for this American sandwich tends to be softer and fluffier than a standard German Kümmelbrötchen or Kümmelweck. In Austria, a similar type of small white-bread is known as Kümmelweckerl (diminutive from Wecken, which refers to a whole big bread, i.e. Brotwecken).|$|R
50|$|There are {{multiple}} variants {{of the common}} roll, differing in size, type of flour used, and toppings. While traditionally plain, Kaiser-style rolls are today found topped with poppy seeds, sesame seeds, pumpkin kernels, linseed, or sunflower seeds. The Kaiser roll is a main part of a typical Austrian breakfast, usually served with butter and jam. It is often used as a bun for such popular sandwiches as hamburgers in America, and {{with a slice of}} Leberkäse in Germany (and Austria itself), though sliced Extrawurst and pickled gherkins (Wurstsemmel), or a type of Wiener Schnitzel (Schnitzelsemmel) are also used.

50|$|When {{tobacco is}} burned, oils from {{adjoining}} not yet ignited particles vaporize and condense into the existing cake {{on the walls}} of the bowl and shank. Over time, these oils can oxidize and turn rancid, causing the pipe to give a sour or bitter smoke. A purported countermeasure involves filling the bowl with <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> carefully wetting it with strong spirits. It is important to not use iodized salt, as the iodine and other additives may impart an unpleasant flavor. Regularly wiping out the bowl with spirits such as vodka or rum is helpful in preventing souring. Commercial pipe-sweetening products are also available.|$|R
50|$|Saltiness is {{the taste}} of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium. It is found in almost every food in low to {{moderate}} proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are {{many different types of}} salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including sea salt, fleur de sel, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt,</b> mined <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> grey <b>salt.</b> Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance, which is the kidney's function. Salt may be iodized, meaning iodine has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function. Some canned foods, notably soups or packaged broths, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.|$|R

5|$|Salt {{is mostly}} sodium chloride, the ionic {{compound}} with the formula NaCl, representing equal proportions of sodium <b>and</b> chlorine. Sea <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> mined <b>salt</b> (much {{of which is}} sea salt from prehistoric seas) also contain small amounts of trace elements (which in these small amounts are generally good for plant and animal health). Mined salt is often refined {{in the production of}} table salt; it is dissolved in water, purified via precipitation of other minerals out of solution, and re-evaporated. During this same refining process it is often also iodized. Salt crystals are translucent and cubic in shape; they normally appear white but impurities may give them a blue or purple tinge. The molar mass of salt is 58.443 g/mol, its melting point is 801°C (1,474°F) and its boiling point 1,465°C (2,669°F). Its density is 2.17 grams per cubic centimetre and it is readily soluble in water. When dissolved in water it separates into Na+ and Cl− ions, and the solubility is 359 grams per litre. From cold solutions, salt crystallises as the dihydrate NaCl·2H2O. Solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is −21.12°C (−6.02°F) for 23.31wt% of <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> the boiling point of saturated salt solution is around 108.7°C (227.7°F).|$|R

This study investigated the effects of chemical and natural decontamination treatments including sprayed application of acidified calcium sulfate (ACS) in combination with -polylysine (EPL), dry-rubbing <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> coating <b>and</b> molten paraffin wax dipping application on microbial populations of broiler carcasses and parts. Treatments were evaluated for their effectiveness in reducing the numbers of artificially inoculated rifampicin resistant Salmonella Typhimurium strain NVSL 95 - 1776 on the skin surface of bone-in chicken breasts. General model procedures were used to find statistical differences (P 2 log reductions) were also observed in validation trials in both pre- and post-chilled samples when compared to non-treated pre- and post-chilled controls. Only for psychrotrophic counts, chilled and post-chill interventions did not have a significant effect (P> 0. 05). The use of molten paraffin wax caused < 0. 51 CFU/ml log reductions on rifampicin resistant Salmonella Typhimurium in chicken breasts. In addition, drip loss on kosher treated samples was 53. 8 % lower than non-treated counterparts. However, <b>kosher</b> <b>salt</b> application caused a decrease in lightness (*L values) and yellowness (*b values) on treated carcasses when compared to controls, redness (*a values) were not significantly affected.

40|$|Abstract: Who {{would think}} of cooking a potato in boiling rosin? The origin and {{rationale}} for this interesting cooking behavior is lost in ethno-botanical lore but directions for the practice persisted until recent editions of The Joy of Cooking (Rombauer and Becker 1975). Indeed, the dish can still be obtained at Sweetie Pies Restaurant (Decatur, TX) one day a week. We obtained rosin (Pinerez 1277), produced by Hexion Specialty Chemicals, to duplicate the cooking recipe and to investigate the gustatory effects. The basic recipe involves heating the rosin to 275 0 F and carefully lowering the spud into the pot (see Figure 1). The potato initially sinks in the rosin, but after about 45 minutes, floats to the surface (Rombauer and Becker 1975). The potato is simmered a further 30 minutes, removed from the rosin, and wrapped in heavy brown paper with the ends twisted tightly. The rosin baked potato is cooled for 10 minutes and then slit and served with butter, <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> ground pepper. The cooking process must be done outside and the skin must not be eaten. The cooking in rosin provides a baked potato with an exceptional texture that is distinctively flaky. Figure 1.

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} natural {{transformation of}} Acinetobacter calcoaceticus BD 413 with homologous chromosomal DNA in a silt loam soil microcosm were investigated. Inducible transformation of declining populations of noncompetent A. calcoaceticus cells was detectable {{for up to}} 6 days when a simple carbon source, <b>salts,</b> <b>and</b> <b>freshly</b> added DNA were used. In two different experimental setups, the residence time in soil of induced cells could be increased to either 11 or 24 h before DNA addition without reduced transformation frequency; 200 -to 1, 000 -fold fewer transformants were observed following the addition of water. These observations suggest that A. calcoaceticus remains transformable for several hours after its activation by nutrients in soil. Increasing the levels of phosphate salts significantly enhanced the numbers of transformants without increasing the recipient counts correspondingly. Variable levels of ammonium or divalent cations (Mg(sup 2 +) and Ca(sup 2 +)) {{did not have a}} similar major influence. Soil moisture content significantly affected the transformation frequency of A. calcoaceticus cells, with a general tendency of higher frequencies in drier soil. A minimal frequency was observed at around 35 % soil moisture. The data indicate that A. calcoaceticus cells in soil which cannot be detectably transformed are easily induced by nutrients to undergo natural transformation with chromosomal DNA. Access to nutrients seems to be critical for the development and maintenance of competence in soil, which is also affected by abiotic factors like moisture level <b>and</b> phosphate <b>salt</b> concentration...|$|R
