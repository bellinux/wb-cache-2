40|$|Research into using {{optical fibres}} {{as the key}} {{components}} in a sensor has been {{of great interest to}} many over the past 50 years(Culshaw & Kersey 2008). Optical fibre sensors prove to have many advantages over conventional electronic sensors. In fact there are many environments where using an electronic sensor may prove to be to be ineffective or outright unuseable (Lee, Kim, Park, Eom, Myoung, Kim, Rho & Choi 2012). Unfortunately optical fibres encounter many other different disadvantages that <b>electronic</b> <b>microphones</b> do not. Therefore optical fibre sensors are still generally only designed and built for specific applications. One of the optical fibre sensors that has {{had a great deal of}} research is the Fibre Optic Microphone (FOM), this particular area of optical fibre sensors is the focus of this dissertation. During the completion of this dissertation many different types of FOMs were investigated, however it soon proved to be too much effort to attempt to learn and categorize each different type. The shear amount of configurations, components and forms of modulating light was staggering. Different physical effects were investigated during the project work, some examples of what was investigated included Fresnel Reections, Acousto-Optic Effect and Interferometry. After the different types of FOMs were investigated and reviewed, several promising types of FOMs were chosen to be investigated further and constructed in order to evaluate their performance characteristics. However due to time and equipment constraints it was not possible to get all of the different types of FOMs to work properly, in the end only one type of FOM was completed. This was the Helix Acousto-Optic Microphone. The Helix Acousto-Optic sensor was then run through a series of tests in order to examine the performance characteristics. The sensor was placed into two different types of configurations, the first was just a basic sensor configuration and the second was a Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration. After the performance characteristics were examined it was evident that the Mach-Zehnder interferometer configuration proved to be the better of the two by a great margin. ...|$|R

Unlike acoustic stethoscopes, which are all based on the same physics, transducers in electronic stethoscopes vary widely. The simplest and least effective method of sound detection is achieved by placing a microphone in the chestpiece. This method suffers from ambient noise interference and has fallen out of favor. Another method, used in Welch-Allyn's Meditron stethoscope, comprises placement of a piezoelectric crystal {{at the head of a}} metal shaft, the bottom of the shaft making contact with a diaphragm. 3M also uses a piezo-electric crystal placed within foam behind a thick rubber-like diaphragm. The Thinklabs' Rhythm 32 uses an Electromagnetic Diaphragm with a conductive inner surface to form a capacitive sensor. This diaphragm responds to sound waves, with changes in an electric field replacing changes in air pressure. The Eko Core enables wireless transmission of heart sounds to a smartphone or tablet.|$|R

40|$|In the {{development}} process of aircraft and rail vehicles, measurement techniques based on microphone-arrays are well-known and common practice on small-scaled models in wind tunnels with closed test section. Since conventional wind tunnels cannot generally achieve full-scale Reynolds numbers, measurements are often performed in cryogenic (down to 100 K) and/or pressurized (up to 450 kPa) wind tunnels which are capable of up to full scale Reynolds number flows. For the application in wind tunnels operating under these special environmental conditions microphone arrays were designed and constructed. Especially {{the selection of the}} sensor equipment, such as <b>microphones,</b> <b>electronic</b> devices, cables for signals and power supply is of major importance.

40|$|This {{study is}} part of an ongoing {{research}} started in 2004 at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) investigating the development of a human-machine interface commandand- control package for controlling robotic units in operational environments. An ear microphone is used to collect the voice-activated commands providing hands-free control instructions in noisy environments [Kurcan, 2006; Bulbuller, 2006]. This study presents the hardware implementation of a theoretical Isolated Word Recognition (IWR) system designed in an earlier study. The recognizer uses a short-term energy and zero-crossing based detection scheme, and a discrete Hidden Markov model recognizer designed to recognize seven isolated words. Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) are used for discriminating features in the recognizer phase.

40|$|Abstract—Electromagnetic {{interference}} (EMI) affects cir-cuits by inducing voltages on conductors. Analog sensing {{of signals}} {{on the order}} of a few millivolts is particularly sensitive to interference. This work (1) measures the susceptibility of analog sensor systems to signal injection attacks by intentional, low-power emission of chosen electromagnetic waveforms, and (2) proposes defense mechanisms to reduce the risks. Our experiments use specially crafted EMI at varying power and distance to measure susceptibility of sensors in implantable medical devices and consumer electronics. Results show that at distances of 1 – 2 m, consumer <b>electronic</b> devices containing <b>microphones</b> are vulnerable to the injection of bogus audio signals. Our measurements show that in free air, intentional EMI under 10 W can inhibit pacing and induce defibrillation shocks at distances up to 1 – 2 m on implantable cardiac elec-tronic devices. However, with the sensing leads and medical devices immersed in a saline bath to better approximate the human body, the same experiment decreased to under 5 cm. Our defenses range from prevention with simple analog shielding to detection with a signal contamination metric based on the root mean square of waveform amplitudes. Our con-tribution to securing cardiac devices includes a novel defense mechanism that probes for forged pacing pulses inconsistent with the refractory period of cardiac tissue.

5000|$|The 'second wave' {{of sound}} {{recording}} history was ushered {{in by the}} introduction of Western Electric's integrated system of electrical <b>microphones,</b> <b>electronic</b> signal amplifiers and electromechanical recorders, which was adopted by major US record labels in 1925. Sound recording now became a hybrid process — sound could now be captured, amplified, filtered and balanced electronically, and the disc-cutting head was now electrically powered, but the actual recording process remained essentially mechanical - the signal was still physically inscribed into a wax 'master' disc, and consumer discs were mass-produced mechanically by stamping a metal electroform made from the wax master into a suitable substance, originally a shellac-based compound and later polyvinyl plastic. The Western Electric system greatly improved the fidelity of sound recording, increasing the reproducible frequency range to a much wider band (between 60 Hz and 6000 Hz) and allowing a new class of professional - the audio engineer - to capture a fuller, richer and more detailed and balanced sound on record, using multiple microphones connected to multi-channel electronic amplifiers, compressors, filters and mixers. Electrical microphones led to a dramatic change in the performance style of singers, ushering {{in the age of the}} [...] "crooner", while electronic amplification had a wide-ranging impact in many areas, enabling the development of broadcast radio, public address systems, and electronically-amplified home record players. In addition, the development of electronic amplifiers for musical instruments now enabled quieter instruments such as the guitar and the string bass to compete on equal terms with the naturally louder wind and horn instruments, and musicians and composers also began to experiment with entirely new electronic musical instruments such as the Theremin, the Ondes Martenot, the electronic organ, and the Hammond Novachord, the world's first analogue polyphonic synthesiser.|$|R
