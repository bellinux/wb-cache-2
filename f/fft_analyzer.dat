This is commonly {{used in conjunction with}} a receiver and analog-to-digital converter. As above, the receiver reduces the center-frequency of a portion of the input signal spectrum, but the portion is not swept. The purpose of the receiver is to reduce the sampling rate that the analyzer must contend with. With a sufficiently low sample-rate, FFT analyzers can process all the samples (100% duty-cycle), and are therefore able to avoid missing short-duration events.|$|E

40|$|System {{response}} measurements {{appear in}} many areas of scientific and technical investigations. The speed of these measurements has been greatly improved with the advent of <b>FFT</b> <b>analyzers.</b> Conventional <b>FFT</b> <b>analyzers</b> require two channels to measure the system response using white noise as a stimulus. Bias errors such as aliasing, leakage, and picket fence effects have to be properly addressed and random errors have to be minimized by averaging. Uses of deterministic types of periodic signal as stimulus are not common although most of these errors would disappear. The inflexibility of the commercial <b>FFT</b> <b>analyzers</b> may be an important reason. To analyze periodic signals, it is necessary to use an `exact' multiple of the period of the signal to avoid leakage effect. It is also necessary to ensure that the signal frequencies coincide `exactly' with the analysis frequencies to avoid picket fence effect. This will require some tailoring of the sampling frequency and the number of data points. We explore the application of deterministic types of periodic signal for system response measurements using a dual channel A/D converter and a special FFT routine. Two types of periodic signal are discussed: (1) pure tones for single frequency measurements and (2) m-sequence or maximum-length sequence (MLS) for broadband measurementsPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

This paper presents the results of our recent experiences in both the collection of FRF data, and the curve fitting of it to obtain the modal parameters of a structure.
