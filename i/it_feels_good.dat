25|$|Self-enhancement {{suggests}} that optimistic predictions are satisfying and that <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>good</b> {{to think that}} positive events will happen. People can control their anxiety and other negative emotions if they believe they are better off than others. People {{tend to focus on}} finding information that supports what they want to see happen, rather than what will happen to them. With regards to the optimistic bias, individuals will perceive events more favorably, because that is what they would like the outcome to be. This also {{suggests that}} people might lower their risks compared to others to make themselves look better than average: they are less at risk than others and therefore better.|$|E

500|$|In May 2010, it was {{identified}} that Morison was eligible to represent Wales due to Welsh ancestry – as his grandmother {{was born in}} Tredegar, near Ebbw Vale. Wales assistant manager Roy Evans was present to watch Morison in Millwall's 1–0 victory against Swindon Town, while Morison [...] "registered his interest" [...] in representing Wales. In July 2010, Wales boss John Toshack named Morison in the Wales squad for a friendly against Luxembourg in Llanelli on 11 August 2010. On being called up to the Wales squad, Morison said [...] "It's a fantastic achievement and <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>good</b> to be recognised for my hard work". Morison subsequently started in Wales' 5–1 victory against Luxembourg, playing the whole match and assisting Ashley Williams' goal. Following Morison's debut, manager John Toshack said [...] "I was very impressed with the debut of Steve Morison, he didn't get on the scoresheet, but he certainly made his presence felt".|$|E

It was a cool concept too because it was kind of one side of me and now, it's evolving into the new colorful stuff that we've been doing." [...] In {{an interview}} for MTV News, Guetta explained his role in the music video, saying [...] "I'm DJing from a spaceship. It's actually really funny, because we shot that in Los Angeles in a place where they used to shoot Star Trek, but like the old ones. And so it's kind of retro futuristic, you know? It's like how people were seeing the future back in the 80s. It has a sense of humor in the video." [...] The nighttime version was released as the song's official music video to download digitally on 1 February 2011.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to gameplay, {{she was also}} one of the first characters to have her backstory fleshed out. In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she was kind of like this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, and <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>good</b> to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of person who does everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, I think she is very much one of the main characters of the game [...] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism." [...] To reflect her English origin, Tracer is voiced by English actress Cara Theobold.|$|E
500|$|Mystic Quest was {{developed}} in a graphic and gameplay style similar to Final Fantasy Legend III (part of the aforementioned SaGa series). The gameplay shares numerous similarities with that title, featuring a very similar battle system, graphical interface, and dungeon system. Even the jump feature from Final Fantasy Legend III has been reproduced, {{and almost all of}} the icons - from caves to the enemy sprites - are a color-upgraded version of Final Fantasy Legend IIIs character set. Besides allowing for computer-controlled allies, the game did away with random battles, complicated storylines, and text-based menus. To appeal to the perceived tastes of North American audiences, which gravitated towards fast-paced games, Square included action-adventure game elements; players could now brandish weapons outside of battle, jump, use a grappling hook, and set bombs to open new paths. North American translator Ted Woolsey explained that [...] "The action/adventure players...are larger in numbers and the demographic is different. They tend to be younger and like the idea of jumping straight into the action with a sword in their hands; it's an empowerment issue - you get to go out there, start whacking things and <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>good!</b> With the more traditional RPGs, it takes a good 15 or 20 hours of playing before you're finally hooked." [...] Woolsey stated that Mystic Quest was one of the easiest games he had to translate, due to the game's small size. Because the game was marketed towards a younger demographic, the game sold for US$39.99. Mystic Quest also came with an Official Strategy Guide that helped inexperienced and new RPG players complete it.|$|E

500|$|... "Trivia" [...] {{received}} relatively positive reviews, {{although many}} critics {{did not enjoy}} the Florida sub-plot. Many television critics agreed that [...] "Trivia" [...] was a marked improvement over many of the episodes {{in the first part}} of the season. Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times wrote, [...] "Aside from a few weak moments, 'Trivia' was a solid episode of The Office and a vast improvement over most of the episodes this season." [...] Myles McNutt from The A.V. Club awarded the episode a B+ rating and wrote positively of the trivia plot, saying, [...] "When The Office reaches its next hiatus, and then its subsequent return, I’ll find myself hoping for more like the trivia side of 'Trivia', storylines that even after contrived introductions can simply sit back and let the character-driven jokes take over the narrative." [...] Chris Plante from New York magazine explained that [...] "If you plan to continue watching The Office, here’s my advice ... You need to forget the negative energy this show attracts. Start thinking of Season Eight like a reboot." [...] He concluded that [...] "The Office is not irreparable. It’s not great either, but there is some marked improvement here over the worst episodes from the first half of the season." [...] Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar.com wrote positively on both the trivia A-plot and the Dwight and Robert B-plot. TV Fanatic reviewer Dan Forcella called the trivia conceit [...] "quite fun" [...] and awarded the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars. The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "The Office continues to find fun and unique ways to spotlight how mundane office life can be by showing ways the gang finds to fill their day." [...] Alan Sepinwall from HitFix, who was notably critical of the new season, called the episode [...] "charming." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White noted that the episode bore stylistic similarities to the third episode of the British version of the show, entitled [...] "The Quiz", writing that [...] "while 'Trivia' does loosely allude to that pub quiz with a bar trivia night, that turns out to be the only thing the two have in common." [...] She did, however, positively write about the humor of the episode, noting that, [...] "the writers squeezed some good laughs out of the idea, and <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>good</b> to be laughing again at The Office." ...|$|E

[...] Writer Shelby Powell took note of Slash's precision on guitar, rating the album 3.5/5 thumbs, but took off points for [...] "a little too much reverence paid to the 90s {{and some of the}} feature selections may have old head purists poking their bottom lips out and putting their lighters down," [...] but concludes that [...] "the assortment of genres blends well." ...|$|E

2500|$|The hippies {{inherited}} various countercultural {{views and}} practices regarding sex and love from the Beat Generation; [...] "their writings influenced the hippies {{to open up}} {{when it came to}} sex, and to experiment without guilt or jealousy." [...] One popular hippie slogan that appeared was [...] "If <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>good,</b> do it!" [...] which for many [...] "meant you were free to love whomever you pleased, whenever you pleased, however you pleased. This encouraged spontaneous sexual activity and experimentation. Group sex, public sex... homosexuality under the influence of drugs, all the taboos went out the window. This doesn't mean that straight sex... or monogamy were unknown, quite the contrary.

This bettered Kayoko Fukushi's previous world best by almost half a minute. (Dibaba's record was broken by Florence Kiplagat on 15 February 2015.) This was her first competitive road race since 2005, but she downplayed the idea of moving on to road running, stating that the track remained her priority. Her 5 kilometre splits were 15:58 – 15:25 – 15:05. She said, [...] "Although I trained a lot together with my husband for this race, a roadrace is something different.

2500|$|In 2009, after {{struggling}} {{in the ratings}} for years, Days of Our Lives received a two-year pickup. However, the soap's budget was decreased by 40%. To make do with the new restrictions, executive producer Ken Corday was forced to fire Deidre Hall and Drake Hogestyn. Marlena's on screen love interest, Drake Hogestyn, had been fired in early 2007 {{as a way to}} clear money in the budget. However, he was brought back in 2008 for storyline purposes and to please fans. The couple were quickly reunited after Drake returned; and then they traveled to Switzerland to treat John's physical disability. Fans were furious with the way the writers wrote John and Marlena out. In an interview with Nelson Branco, Deidre said, [...] "Yes. There was enormous upheaval. I wasn't following a lot of the brouhaha but I was told fans and critics were upset. But it is what it is. Yes, <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>good</b> to hear that fans miss Marlena.
