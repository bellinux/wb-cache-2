A large diameter (17 "), conventional shock tube {{has been used}} as the pre-ionizer for an <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> shock tube in an attempt to achieve separation of the shock front and the current sheath in the <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch.</b> The <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> was mounted in the endwall of the shock tube and was operated without an anode, either behind the incident or reflected shock wave generated by the pre-ionizer shock tube. The test gases used were Xenon, Argon, and Helium. Separation was not achieved, but in Argon the pressure front did move closer {{to the front of the}} current sheath. In Xenon, no improvement in the performance of the <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> was observed as a result of the pre-ionization, and in one case it was noticeably degraded, with the piston appearing to leak excessively. Because of test time limitations it was only possible to operate the <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> behind the incident shock wave in Xenon. By measuring the ionization relaxation time in Xenon it was found that for all the conditions of the present experiments, ionization equilibrium was not attained in the times available. Therefore, the <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> was being operated in a slightly ionized, relaxing gas. The electrical conductivity of such a gas was calculated for Xenon and Argon and the results in Argon were found to be in good agreement with previous shock tube measurements of the conductivity. The relaxation time measurements, conducted primarily in the GALCIT 6 " shock tube, show that [ [...] . ], the product of the initial pressure and the relaxation time behind the incident shock, depends strongly upon the magnitude of [ [...] . ], especially for [ [...] . ] <. 5 mm Hg of Xenon. The dependence decreases as the Mach number is increased in the range 10 < [ [...] . ] < 20. 6. Part 2. Previous shock tube observations of "spurious" signals in the output of thin-film heat gauges at Mach number for which the shocked gas becomes partially ionized are summarized. It is shown that these effects, and those observed the the present experiments in Xenon, cannot be explained in terms of a shorting gauge model. It is demonstrated that the effects are due to the gauge acting more as an electrostatic probe than as a heat gauge. Under these conditions it is shown that the heat gauge provides an accurate measurement of the ionization relaxation time as well as still being useful for determing the shock velocity. The thin-film is also operated as a flush electrostatic probe to measure the ion density in the shock tube wall boundary layer, and the experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions of two solutions of the bounday layer problem: one based on an approximate solution of the transformed boundary layer equations, and the other based on the solution of the equivalent Couette flow problems. The applicability of these solutions is found to be limited to conditions for which the ionization relaxation time is either very long or very short. Because of the computational simplifications involved it is seen that the Couette flow solution is preferred under most conditions...|$|E
40|$|The plasma-puff {{triggering}} mechanism {{based on}} a hypocycloidal pinch geometry was investigated to determine the optimal operating conditions for the azimuthally uniform surface flashover which initiates plasma-puff under wide range of fill gas pressure of Ar, He and N 2. The optimal fill gas pressure for the azimuthally uniform plasma-puff was about 120 mTorr and 450 Torr for He and N 2, and between 120 mTorr and 5 Torr for Ar. The <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> switch was triggered with the plasma-puff and the switching capability under various electrical parameters and working gas pressures of Ar, He and N 2 was determined. It was also shown that the azimuthally uniform switching discharges were dependent {{on the type of}} fill gas and its fill pressure. A new concept of plasma-focus driven plasma-puff was also discussed in comparison with the hypocycloidal pinch plasma-puff triggering. The main discharge of <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> switch with plasma-focus driven plasma-puff trigger is found to be more azimuthally uniform than that with hypocycloidal pinch plasma-puff trigger in a gas pressure region between 80 mTorr and 1 Torr...|$|E
40|$|A novel plasma switch, the <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> switch (IN-PIS), with a {{combination}} geometry based on an inverse-pinch mechanism, has been tested and shown to alleviate the shortcomings of conventional spark gaps. The INPIS switch or INPIStron is currently being upscaled for high-voltage (approximately 1 MV) operation with a multigap arrangement similar to Sandia's rimfire electrodes used for ultra-high-voltage hold off. Preliminary results of the multigap INPIS tests at 230 kV and plasma-puff initiation methods are presented, and an application to compact pulser systems is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{toroidal}} {{version of}} the hard-core pinch tube is created by levitating a ring conductor inside a toroidal shell. The magnitude of induced H/ sub theta / necessary for levi-tation is small in terms of field strengths normally desired for energetic pinches. In a 3 -in. glass-and-copper toroid of square cross section a 3 / 4 -in. hollow copper ring has been levitated with a 60 - cycle current of 3 kiloamperes. A 12 -in stainless steel tube of round cross section is being built. The stability of nearvacuum field hard-core configurations is best investigated in toroidal geometry. At high power levels and low plasma densities, the conventional toroidal stabilized pinch'' is subject to an anomalous plasma energy leakage to the wall, which cannot {{be explained by the}} observed ultraviolet radiation alone. A critical question is, therefore, whether the relative stability of some hard-core pinches, as reflected by the smoothness and reproducibility of magnetic probe traces, is reflected by an improved containment of the plasma en-ergy leading to high temperature. A toroidal hard-core tube is also useful in studying the nature of the nonhydromagnetic instabilities observed in the linear <b>inverse</b> stabilized <b>pinch.</b> '' The presence and condition of electrodes appear to have a substantial effect on the magnitude of these instabilities, as would be expected if they were, for instance, of electrostatic origin. In order to complement the plasma study of the hard-core pinch, we have developed an analogue method using sodium tubes to simulate the current-carrying layer. In this way the purely hydromagnetic aspect of the plasma behavior can be isolated. (auth...|$|R
40|$|Radial {{particle}} transport {{has been}} experimentally {{studied in the}} low-aspect-ratio heliotron/torsatron device CHS. A non-diffusive outward particle flow (<b>inverse</b> <b>pinch)</b> is observed in the magnetic configuration with the magnetic axis shifted outward, while an inward pinch, like in tokamaks, is observed with the magnetic axis shifted inward. This change {{in the direction of}} anomalous particle flow is not due to the reversal of temperature gradient nor the radial electric field. The observation suggests that the particle pinch velocity is sensitive to the magnetic field structure...|$|E
40|$|An <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> plasma switch, INPIStron, was {{studied in}} {{comparison}} to a conventional spark gap. The INPIStron is under development for high power switching applications. The INPIStron has an <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> dynamics, opposed to Z-pinch dynamics in the spark gap. The electrical, plasma dynamics and radiative properties of the closing plasmas have been studied. Recently the high-voltage pulse transfer capabilities or both the INPIStron and the spark gap were also compared. The INPIStron with a low impedance Z = 9 ohms transfers 87 percent of an input pulse with a halfwidth of 2 mu s. For the same input pulse the spark gap of Z = 100 ohms transfers 68 percent. Fast framing and streak photography, taken with an TRW image converter camera, was used to observe the discharge uniformity and closing plasma speed in both switches. In order to assess the effects of closing plasmas on erosion of electrode material, emission spectra of two switches were studied with a spectrometer-optical multi channel analyzer (OMA) system. The typical emission spectra of the closing plasmas in the INPIStron and the spark gap showed that there were comparatively weak carbon line emission in 658. 7 nm and copper (electrode material) line emissions in the INPIStron, indicating low erosion of materials in the INPIStron...|$|E
40|$|Experiments are {{performed}} on the plasma produced in a large <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> using argon with no applied magnetic fields or preheating. A direct observation is made of the precursor ionization which initially raises the electron temperature and electrical conductivity. Calculations show {{that most of the}} mass is entrained in the current sheet, but that less than complete sweeping occurs at the lower velocities. The shock which is embedded in the current sheet closely resembles an ordinary gasdynamic shock. Consideration of the shock jump condition derived from the induction equation is shown to determine the frequent inability of the shock to separate from the current sheet...|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{study of}} a simplified model of a high coulomb transfer switch is performed. The switch operates in an <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> geometry formed by an all metal chamber, which greatly reduces hot spot formations on the electrode surfaces. Advantages of the switch over the conventional switches are longer useful life, higher current capability and lower inductance, which improves the characteristics required for a high repetition rate switch. The simulation determines the design parameters by analytical computations and comparison with the experimentally measured risetime, current handling capability, electrode damage, and hold-off voltages. The parameters of initial switch design can be determined for the anticipated switch performance. Results are {{in agreement with the}} experiment results. Although the model is simplified, the switch characteristics such as risetime, current handling capability, electrode damages, and hold-off voltages are accurately determined...|$|E
40|$|Solar flares and magnetospheric substorms are {{discussed}} {{in the context of a}} general theory of impulsive flux transfer events (IFTE). IFTE theory, derived from laboratory observations in the Double <b>Inverse</b> <b>Pinch</b> Device (DIPD), provides a quantitative extension of 'neutral sheet' theories to include nonsteady field line reconnection. Current flow along the reconnection line increases with magnetic flux storage. When flux build-up exceeds the level corresponding to a critical limit on the current, instabilities induce a sudden transition in the mode of conduction. The resulting IFTE, indifferent to the specific modes and instabilities involved, is the more energetic, the lower the initial resistivity. It is the more violent, the greater the resulting resistivity increase and the faster its growth. Violent events can develop very large voltage transients along the reconnection line. Persistent build-up promoting conditions produce relaxation oscillations in the quantity of flux and energy stored (build-up-IFTE cycles). It is difficult to avoid the conclusion: flares and substorms are examples of IFTE...|$|E
40|$|The plasma-puff {{triggering}} mechanism {{based on}} a hypocycloidal pinch geometry was investigated to determine the optimal operating conditions for an azimuthally uniform surface flashover which initiates plasma-puff under wide ranges of fill gas pressures of Ar, He and N 2. The optimal fill gas pressures for the azimuthally uniform plasma-puff were about 120 mTorr less than P(opt) less than 450 Torr for He and N 2. For Argon 120 mTorr less than P(opt) less than 5 Torr for argon. The <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> switch was triggered with the plasma-puff and the switching capability under various electrical parameters and working gas pressures of Ar, He and N 2 was determined. It was also shown that the azimuthally uniform switching discharges were dependent {{on the type of}} fill gas and its fill pressure. A new concept of plasma-focus driven plasma-puff was also discussed in comparison with hypocycloidal pinch plasma-puff triggering. The main discharge of the <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> switch with the plasma-focus driven plasma-puff trigger is found to be more azimuthally uniform than that with the hypocycloidal pinch plasma-puff trigger in a gas pressure region between 80 mTorr and 1 Torr. In order to assess the effects of plasma current density on material erosion of electrodes, emissions from both an inverse-pinch plasma switch (INPIStron) and from a spark gap switch under test were studied with an optical multichannel analyzer (OMA). The color temperature of the argon plasma was approximately 4, 000 K which corresponded with the peak continuum emission near 750 nm. There are the strong line emissions of argon in the 650 - 800 nm range and a lack of line emissions of copper and other solid material used in the switch. This indicates that the plasma current density during closing is low and the hot spot or hot filament in the switch is negligible. This result also indicates considerable reduction of line emission with the INPIStron switch over that of a spark-gap switch. However, a strong carbon line emission exists due to vaporization of the plastic insulator used. In order to reduce the vaporization of the insulator, the plexiglass insulating material of INPIStron was replaced with Z- 9 material. A comparative study of the INPIStron and a spark gap also reveals that the INPIStron, with a low impedance of Z equals 9 ohms, can transfer a high voltage pulse with a superior pulse-shape fidelity over that of a spark gap with Z equals 100 ohms...|$|E
40|$|A Dense Plasma Focus (DPF) is a pulsed-power {{machine that}} electromagnetically accelerates and cylindrically {{compresses}} a shocked plasma in a Z-pinch. The pinch {{results in a}} brief (about 100 nanosecond) pulse of X-rays, and, for some working gases, also a pulse of neutrons. A great deal of experimental {{research has been done}} into the physics of DPF reactions, and there exist mathematical models describing its behavior during the different time phases of the reaction. Two of the phases, known as the <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> and the rundown, are approximately governed by magnetohydrodynamics, {{and there are a number}} of well-established codes for simulating these phases in two dimensions or in three dimensions under the assumption of axial symmetry. There has been little success, however, in developing fully three-dimensional simulations. In this work we present three-dimensional simulations of DPF reactions and demonstrate that 3 D simulations predict qualitatively and quantitatively different behavior than their 2 D counterparts. One of the most important quantities to predict is the time duration between the formation of the gas shock and Z-pinch, and the 3 D simulations more faithfully represent experimental results for this time duration and are essential for accurate prediction of future experiments...|$|E
40|$|A problem {{inherent}} in magnetic shock tubes is {{the difficulty of}} achieving separation of the driving current sheet and the shock wave. If such devices are {{to be applied to}} produce shock waves for experimentation, then separation will usually be a necessary requirement. In the present experiments in an <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> shock tube, preliminary measurements showed that not only was separation not achieved, but under certain conditions the shock was actually found to be located far behind the front of the current sheet. This appeared to be a paradoxical case of the shock wave pushing the piston. Moreover, measurements of the current sheet velocity indicated that the interaction of the current sheet with the gas should be strong enough to sweep up all the gas encountered by the current sheet and thus to produce a shock wave moving ahead of it. In order to find explanations for the absence of separation and for some other puzzling aspects of these early experiments, further measurements were made to study in more detail the processes taking place in the device. These included measurements of the radial electric field with electrostatic probes and of the ionization levels by the technique of spectral line broadening. The results of these measurements show that the degree of ionization is surprisingly low and that the amount of gas leaking through the current sheet is significantly high in some cases. The conclusion is then reached that although the so-called "snowplow model" is successful in predicting the current sheet velocity, it does not lead to the correct picture of the physical processes taking place. Finally, conditions for which separation may be achievable are inferred from the experiments...|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. Current sheets in <b>inverse</b> <b>pinch</b> MHD shock tubes exhibit the strange property of forming shocks {{in the very}} rear of the sheet when accelerating heavy gases. When accelerating light gases, shocks are formed further to the front in the sheet, but in no case do the shocks separate from the driving current sheet. This "piston dragging shock" effect is explained {{on the basis of}} a single-fluid model with variable conductivity. Shocks are shown to always form within current sheets which move at supersonic speeds with respect to the driven gas. The relevant parameters for determining the shock position are the Mach number and the magnetic Reynolds number. Large magnetic Reynolds numbers and small Mach numbers enhance forward shock formation. These conditions are obtained in light gases with high speeds of sound. Similarity methods are developed to estimate gas conductivities, electron temperatures, and degrees of ionization for the experiments which are conducted. In hydrogen typical electron temperatures of 4 ev are produced by the ohmic heating, but twice this value is shown necessary to achieve separation at the current sheet speeds of 2 - 3 [ [...] . ] used. Higher current sheet speeds produce shocks in the rear of the current sheet where separation can never occur. The correct method of procedure and the relevant design parameters to achieve separation are given. The success of single-fluid methods in explaining plasma phenomena is especially notable, and these methods can be extended to other similar problems. Based on these methods, multiple-fluid and microscopic effects are easily detectable and can be accounted for...|$|E
