Those who belittled this Victoria man, who learned to bowl his spinners in an unorthodox manner during the war years, were now forced to admit that Australia had found another bowling trump card.|$|E

Their willingness to be 'guided' by their manager, their record company and their producers is unparalleled. Never <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings." [...] Albini later apologized for his remarks, saying, [...] "to this day I regret having done it. I don't think that I regarded the band as significantly as I should have." ...|$|E

500|$|Henry hired Swiss {{troops to}} help him defend himself in Paris. The Parisians, however, claimed the right to defend the city themselves. On 12 May 1588, they set up {{barricades}} {{in the streets and}} refused to take orders from anyone except the Duke of Guise. When Catherine tried to go to Mass, she found her way barred, though she was allowed through the barricades. The chronicler L'Estoile reported that she cried all through her lunch that day. She wrote to Bellièvre, [...] "Never <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> myself in such trouble or with so little light by which to escape." [...] As usual, Catherine advised the king, who had fled the city in the nick of time, to compromise and live to fight another day. On 15 June 1588, Henry duly signed the Act of Union, which gave in to all the League's latest demands.|$|E
500|$|The film {{opened to}} largely {{positive}} reviews in India. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film the highest praise and deemed it [...] "a well-chiselled marvel" [...] saying: [...] "Waiting {{is at once}} heart-wrenching and uplifting... marked by deep philosophical undertones, but it is never unduly ponderous." [...] A reviewer for The New Indian Express also spoke highly of the film saying, [...] "Not since Ritesh Batra's The Lunchbox <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> an indie film addressing itself to the ageless issue of human desolation and individual grief with such warmth, dignity, grace, honesty and humour." [...] For Namrata Joshi of The Hindu, the script was [...] "dignified [...] without any false notes", and the film managed [...] "to {{stand on its own}} emotional ground... The people, situations, relationships, feelings are layered, warm and humourous, ringing true in their complexities." [...] Mohar Basu of The Times of India called the film [...] "thought-provoking" [...] writing: [...] "Menon has whipped up a warm tale about love, loss and surviving life's catastrophic blows, with such simplicity." ...|$|E
500|$|A decade later, a New York Times {{reporter}} {{visiting the}} zoo noted that [...] "...an Asiatic Black Bear {{lay on a}} rock {{a short distance from}} a guard rail. A shattered wine bottle, a cracked stick, and a number of empty beer cans were strewn about the ground a few feet in front of him. 'How many times <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> a bear lift his foot and leave a bloody foot print?' said John Kinzig, a park supervisor at the Prospect Park Zoo. 'Vandalism is a major problem, and deterioration is overtaking repairs.'" [...] Activists were pressing for major renovations of the zoo, which, in 1983, was rated by the Humane Society of the United States as one of the [...] "10 worst" [...] zoos in the country. Others felt that a zoo was not in keeping with the original design of Prospect Park and urged its complete removal from the grounds. A fatal accident of an 11-year-old boy scaling the fence to the polar bear pit only served to underscore difficulties with the fifty-year-old facility.|$|E

500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, {{noting that}} the actress [...] "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek {{a couple of years}} ago <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." [...] Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has [...] "been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that [...] "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out to be sort of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also had the feeling that this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves." ...|$|E
500|$|Sometimes Levin {{wrote about}} frivolous, even farcical matters, {{such as a}} series of mock-indignant {{articles}} about the sex-lives of mosquitoes. At other times he wrote about matters of grave moral importance, unfailingly denouncing authoritarian regimes whether of the left or the right. He observed, [...] "I am barred by the governments concerned from entering the Soviet Union and the lands of her empire {{on the one hand and}} South Africa on the other. These decrees constitute a pair of campaign medals that I wear with considerable pleasure and I have a profound suspicion of those who rebuke me for partisanship while wearing only one". He wrote regularly about the arts. Music was a recurrent theme; he was notorious for his addiction to Wagner, and other favourite composers included Schubert and Mozart. He wrote about performers he admired, including Otto Klemperer, Alfred Brendel, and Kiri Te Kanawa. He turned less regularly to the visual arts, but when he did his views were clear-cut and trenchantly expressed. He wrote of a Pre-Raphaelite exhibition in 1984, [...] "Never, in all my life, not even at the exclusively Millais exhibition in 1967, <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> so much sickening rubbish in one place at one time".

Former BBC journalist Paul Mason commented: [...] "Not since Iraq <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> BBC News working at propaganda strength like this". The BBC replied that [...] "Our coverage of the referendum story is fair and impartial {{in line with the}} editorial guidelines". Alex Massie wrote in The Spectator that the BBC's coverage was consistent with their attitude towards other government proposals of such magnitude and that it was incumbent upon the Yes campaign to prove its assertions.|$|E

2500|$|South Africa's last Test series {{before their}} {{expulsion}} from international cricket was against Bill Lawry's Australians. The Australians {{had just completed}} a gruelling tour of India in vastly different playing conditions before coming to South Africa. Pollock's form continued into the series and he averaged 73.85. Pollock managed to break Jackie McGlew's South African Test record of 255 when he scored 274 in the 2nd Test in Durban. When Pollock was batting in this innings with Barry Richards, the opposing captain, Bill Lawry, said about this innings: [...] "Never <b>have</b> <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> the ball hit with such power by two players at the same time." [...] He held this record for nearly thirty years until Daryll Cullinan scored 275 not out against New Zealand in 1999. Pollock was 26 years of age when his Test career was brought to an end.|$|E
