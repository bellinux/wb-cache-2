The rights of broadcasting organisations last for 50 {{years after the first}} transmission of a broadcast. The European Commission proposed this be extended to 95 years and following this suggestion the European Parliament passed legislation to increase the term to 70 years.|$|R

5|$|After its {{discovery}} in 1897, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> recorded again {{and it is}} now considered extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on María Madre may have contributed to its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below. Its diet may have included plant material and small animals.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 2004, Capcom debuted Haunting Ground {{under its}} Japanese name Demento at the Tokyo Game Show after {{launching}} a teaser page on their official website two days prior. The game {{was released in}} Japan on April 21, 2005, and later in PAL territories on April 29, and in North America on May 10. Critics described the game as a spiritual successor to the Clock Tower series, although <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> officially declared as such.|$|E

5|$|The American pilot {{has been}} heavily bootlegged, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> {{broadcast}} on TV in any country. Excerpts {{from the first}} pilot are included in Dwarfing USA, a featurette on {{the making of the}} pilots included on the DVD release of Red Dwarf's fifth series. Because of rights clearance issues, no footage from the second pilot is included in the featurette.|$|E
5|$|Walton {{worked for}} many years on his only {{full-length}} opera, Troilus and Cressida, both before its premiere and afterwards. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> regarded as a success. The libretto is generally considered weak, and Walton's music, despite many passages that have won critical praise, is not dramatic enough to sustain interest. Grove calls the work a partially successful attempt to revivify the traditions of nineteenth-century Italian opera in a post-war era wary of heroic Romanticism.|$|E
5|$|A Canticle for Leibowitz {{is based}} on three short stories Miller contributed to The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. It is the only novel {{published}} by the author during his lifetime. (His follow-up work, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, was published posthumously in 1997.) Considered one of the classics of science fiction, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> out of print and has seen over 25 reprints and editions. Appealing to mainstream and genre critics and readers alike, it won the 1961 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> out of print.|$|E
5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> used.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> fully {{explained}} what motivated the attack: the gunmen {{claimed to have}} been acting on their own initiative, and despite abundant conspiracy theories, no convincing evidence surfaced to suggest that any political leader or party was behind the attack. Nevertheless, the killings left a leadership void in the political establishment. Conspiracy theories immediately flourished that the gunmen had been acting on orders to sabotage a Karabakh peace deal, but a decade on, the available evidence still pointed to the leading gunman being a loner with a grudge against the Armenian political elite.|$|E

5|$|Netball gained Olympic {{recognition}} in 1995 after 20 years of lobbying. Although <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> {{played at the}} Summer Olympics, politicians and administrators have been campaigning to have it included in the near future. Its absence from the Olympics has been seen by the netball community as a hindrance in the global growth of the game by limiting access to media attention and funding sources. Some funding sources became available with {{recognition in}} 1995, including the International Olympic Committee, national Olympic committees, national sport organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E
5|$|The Nemegt Formation was {{deposited}} {{within the}} Late Cretaceous, although its exact age is unknown as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> dated radiometrically. According to different authors, the formation is late Campanian to early Maastrichtian, early Maastrichtian, or middle Maastrichtian in age. The sediments of the Nemegt Formation were deposited {{in a plain}} crossed by rivers. The climate was warm and subhumid with seasonal droughts, and the soils were relatively dry. Nevertheless, the Nemegt Formation was more humid than the underlying (and thus older) Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations, which show a semiarid climate.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{isolation of}} Callisto means that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> appreciably tidally heated, which has important consequences for its internal structure and evolution. Its distance from Jupiter {{also means that}} the charged-particle flux from Jupiter's magnetosphere at its surface is relatively lowabout 300 times lower than, for example, that at Europa. Hence, unlike the other Galilean moons, charged-particle irradiation has had a relatively minor effect on Callisto's surface. The radiation level at Callisto's surface is equivalent to a dose of about 0.01 rem (0.1 mSv) per day, which is over ten times higher than Earth's average background radiation.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} theatrically in the United States and Canada in September 1982 {{and then quickly}} withdrawn because of its poor performance at the box office. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> released on home video, although it has sometimes been broadcast on television. It was the largest financial loss in film of 1982, earning less than $2 million. Reviewers at the time gave it consistently bad reviews and later commentators including Newsweek, TV Guide and Canadian Press have classed Inchon among the worst films of all time.|$|E
5|$|The partial {{differentiation}} of Callisto (inferred e.g. from {{moment of inertia}} measurements) means that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> heated enough to melt its ice component. Therefore, the most favorable model of its formation is a slow accretion in the low-density Jovian subnebulaa disk of the gas and dust that existed around Jupiter after its formation. Such a prolonged accretion stage would allow cooling to largely {{keep up with the}} heat accumulation caused by impacts, radioactive decay and contraction, thereby preventing melting and fast differentiation. The allowable timescale of formation of Callisto lies then in the range 0.1million10million years.|$|E
5|$|All Souls {{suffered}} from low viewership, and {{was placed on}} hiatus following the broadcast of the fist two episodes. It was originally paired with the reality television show Chains of Love. All Souls was canceled after the remaining four episodes were broadcast. In later interviews, the actors had varying views on the reasons behind the show's cancellation. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> released on DVD or Blu-ray, or made available on online-streaming services. Critical response to All Souls was primarily positive, with commentators praising its use of horror and paranormal elements. Critics compared the show to other horror and science-fiction television series, specifically The X-Files {{and the work of}} American writer Stephen King.|$|E
