40|$|In Aspergillus fumigatus, the conidial surface {{contains}} dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) -melanin. Six-clustered gene {{products have}} been identified that mediate sequential catalysis of DHN-melanin biosynthesis. Melanin thus produced {{is known to be}} a virulence factor, protecting the fungus from the host defense mechanisms. In the present study, individual deletion of the genes involved in the initial three steps of melanin biosynthesis resulted in an altered conidial surface with masked surface rodlet layer, leaky cell wall allowing the deposition of proteins on the cell surface and exposing the otherwise-masked cell wall polysaccharides at the surface. Melanin as such was immunologically inert; however, deletion mutant conidia with modified surfaces could activate human dendritic cells and the subsequent cytokine production in contrast to the wild-type conidia. Cell surface <b>defects</b> were <b>rectified</b> in the conidia mutated in downstream melanin biosynthetic pathway, and maximum immune inertness was observed upon synthesis of vermelone onward.

40|$|Software defect {{management}} {{is a critical}} component of good software engineering practice. The information reported about a defect is a key element to ensure <b>defects</b> are <b>rectified</b> effectively. However, based on research, reporting usability defects using an existing defect tracking system (DTS) is impractical. This is due to text-centric design and lack of features to support usability attributes. In addition, not all defects can be explained textually; especially defects that involve interface redesign. Another aspect to consider is that the reporters describe usability defects based on their usability knowledge and the information available at the time the defects are found. Defects stored in a DTS in a universal format. Therefore, when reporting usability defects there are some possibilities: the data may not be relevant or irrelevant, useful or not useful, or may even be beyond the reporter's knowledge. This makes it impossible to submit a high quality defect report. To address these issues, I propose a custom defect template that can adjust defect form according to whom, when and how the defect is found. In this way, it will provide flexibility to the reporters to record data based on their expertise and knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-In {{software}} project management, {{there are}} five basic factors to predict and control, those are size, process, effort, environment and quality. Most of the software engineers focus on these factors to improve the software quality. In practice quality management implies finding <b>defects</b> and <b>rectifying</b> them. Software <b>defects</b> are not well enough understood to provide a clear methodology for avoiding or recovering from them. Most of the research related to software quality focuses on modeling the residual defects in the software to estimate software reliability. Software project management need to be improved in order to predict other possible information about software quality such as in-process defects, their type, classify the defects into a group and so on. Currently software engineers still don’t have a complete defect prediction technique {{for any kind of}} software product.

40|$|Cell cycle checkpoints act {{to protect}} cells from {{external}} stresses and internal errors that would compromise {{the integrity of}} the cell. Checkpoints are often defective in cancer cells. Drugs that target checkpoint mechanisms should therefore be selective for tumor cells that are defective for the drug-sensitive checkpoint. Histone deacetylase inhibitors typify this class of agents. They trigger a G(2) -phase checkpoint response in normal cells but are cytotoxic in tumor cells in which this checkpoint is defective. In this study, we investigated that molecular basis of the tumor-selective cytotoxicity of these drugs and demonstrated that it is due to the disruption of two cell cycle checkpoints. The first is the histone deacetylase inhibitor-sensitive G(2) -phase checkpoint, which is defective in drug-sensitive cells and permits cells to enter an aberrant mitosis. The second is the drug-dependent bypass of the mitotic spindle checkpoint that normally detects aberrant mitosis and blocks mitotic exit until the <b>defect</b> is <b>rectified.</b> The disruption of both checkpoints results in the premature exit of cells from an abortive mitosis followed by apoptosis. This study of histone deacetylase inhibitors demonstrates that drugs targeting cell cycle checkpoints can provide the selectivity and cytotoxicity desired in effective chemotherapeutic agents...|$|R
40|$|The spindle {{assembly}} checkpoint arrests cells in mitosis when defects in mitotic {{spindle assembly}} or partitioning of the replicated genome are detected. This checkpoint blocks exit from mitosis until the <b>defect</b> is <b>rectified</b> or the cell initiates apoptosis. In {{this study we}} have used caffeine to identify components of the mechanism that signals apoptosis in mitotic checkpoint-arrested cells. Addition of caffeine to spindle checkpoint-arrested cells induced > 40 % apoptosis within 5 h. It also caused proteasome-mediated destruction of cyclin B 1, a corresponding reduction in cyclin B 1 /cdk 1 activity, and reduction in MPM- 2 reactivity. However, cells retained MAD 2 staining at the kinetochores, an indication of continued spindle checkpoint function. Blocking proteasome activity did not block apoptosis, but continued spindle checkpoint function was essential for apoptosis. After systematically eliminating all known targets, we have identified p 21 -activated kinase PAK 1, which has an anti-apoptotic function in spindle checkpoint-arrested cells, as a target for caffeine inhibition. Knockdown of PAK 1 also increased apoptosis in spindle checkpoint-arrested cells. This study demonstrates that the spindle checkpoint not only regulates mitotic exit but apoptosis in mitosis through the activity of PAK 1...|$|R

The pathophysiological {{functions of}} HO- 1 {{have been associated with}} its enzymatic activities in heme catabolism. We have examined the immune functions of HO- 1 by its conditional ablation in myeloid cells (HO- 1 M-KO mice). We demonstrate that myeloid HO- 1 is required for the activation of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor (IRF) 3 after Toll-like receptor 3 or 4 stimulation, or viral infection. HO- 1 –deficient macrophages show reduced expression of IFN-β and of primary IRF 3 target genes encoding RANTES, IP- 10 and MCP- 1. In the presence of polyI:C, myeloid HO- 1 knockout mice infected with Listeria monocytogenes, a model dependent on IFN-β production, showed enhanced bacterial clearance and survival, whereas control mice succumbed to infection. Moreover, after induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, mice with myeloid-specific HO- 1 deficiency developed a higher incidence and an exacerbated, nonremitting clinical disease correlating with persistent activation of antigen-presenting cells, enhanced infiltration of Th 17 cells, and a nonregressing myelin-specific T cell reactivity. Notably, these <b>defects</b> were <b>rectified</b> by exogenous administration of IFN-β, confirming that HO- 1 functions directly upstream of this critical immune pathway.

In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256 x 256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to <b>rectify</b> <b>defects</b> in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.
