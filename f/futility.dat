5|$|Bolstered by {{the fresh}} troops, the Spartans and their Macedonian allies {{prepared}} themselves for Pyrrhus' next assault against the trench. The presence of more adversaries intensified Pyrrhus' determination {{to capture the}} city and he ordered another attack on the trenches. He was unable to accomplish anything and suffered further losses. The failure of this attack convinced Pyrrhus about the <b>futility</b> of persevering with the siege {{and he decided to}} lift it and withdraw.|$|E

5|$|The {{legend of}} Mussie likely began around 1916, though folk tales claim that Canadian pioneer Samuel de Champlain {{wrote about it}} in the early seventeenth century.

5|$|Waugh had {{converted}} to Roman Catholicism in 1930, after which his satirical, secular writings drew hostility from some Catholic quarters. He did not introduce overtly religious themes into A Handful of Dust, but later {{explained that he}} intended the book to demonstrate the <b>futility</b> of humanist, as distinct from religious, especially Catholic, values. The book has been dramatised for radio, stage and screen.|$|E

5|$|Witnesses in the British {{infantry}} {{recorded as}} many as 12assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer.

5|$|A common {{criticism}} {{of the game is}} its short length. Episode One takes roughly 4–6 hours to complete, which raises the issue of whether the game justifies its price. Computer Games Magazine argued the <b>futility</b> of reviewing the game due to its episodic nature; as the first part of a three-part story arc, it is difficult to judge it when divorced from the final product. Game Revolution expressed disappointment at a lack of new features such as environments and weapons.|$|E
5|$|Albert of Aachen says William's second {{desertion}} {{occurred in}} June 1098, along with William of Grand-Mesnil, {{a relative of}} Bohemond. On the road away from Antioch, they joined Stephen of Blois, another leader of the crusade who had also fled the siege. They travelled back towards Constantinople, but on the way met Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, who was advancing to Antioch with a relief army. They convinced him of the <b>futility</b> of the crusader siege and the emperor turned back to Constantinople.|$|E

5|$|As if {{struck by}} a blow, one {{suddenly}} recognizes the scientific <b>futility,</b> the biological senselessness, and the social noxiousness of views and institutions, which until that moment had seemed altogether natural and self-evident.

I might even voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E
5|$|Brain death {{refers to}} an {{irreversible}} total loss of brain function. This is characterised by coma, loss of reflexes, and apnoea, however, the declaration of brain death varies geographically and is not always accepted. In some countries {{there is also a}} defined syndrome of brainstem death. Declaration of brain death can have profound implications as the declaration, under the principle of medical <b>futility,</b> will be associated with the withdrawal of life support, and as those with brain death often have organs suitable for organ donation. The process is often made more difficult by poor communication with patients' families.|$|E
5|$|By early July, Butler had {{realized}} the <b>futility</b> of his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking {{much of the}} drama from the debates. The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman {{was elected to the}} Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.|$|E

5|$|Charles was {{the second}} son of King James VI of Scotland, but after his father {{inherited}} the English throne in 1603, he moved to England, where {{he spent much of}} the rest of his life. He became heir apparent to the English, Irish, and Scottish thrones on the death of his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1612. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the <b>futility</b> of the marriage negotiations. Two years later, he married the Bourbon princess Henrietta Maria of France instead.|$|E
5|$|In the morning, Horrocks {{visited the}} Polish {{positions}} at Driel {{to see the}} front for himself. Later, he hosted a conference attended by Browning, Major-General Ivor Thomas of the 43rd (Wessex) Division and Sosabowski at Valburg. In a controversial meeting in which Sosabowski was politically outmanoeuvred, {{it was decided that}} another crossing would be attempted that night. When the Germans cut the narrow supply road near Nijmegen later that day though, it seems Horrocks realised the <b>futility</b> of the situation and plans were drawn up to withdraw the 1st Division.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{attacks from}} both sides followed, but none were fatal, and the two groups quickly {{realized}} the <b>futility</b> of their attempts to drive the other out. In February 1690, the French began peace negotiations with the Iroquois. The French returned captured natives {{in exchange for the}} beginnings of peace talks. Through the 1690s, there were no major French or native raids and, even against the will of the English, peace talks continued. This time of relative peace eventually led to the Montreal Treaty of 1701, by which the Iroquois promised to remain neutral in case of war between the French and English.|$|E

To-morrow had come; the mysterious and lying to-morrow that lures men, disdainful of love and faith, on and on through the poignant <b>futilities</b> of life to the fitting reward of a grave. He counted the strokes, and gazing at the grate seemed to wait for more. Then, as if called out, left the room, walking firmly.|$|R

5|$|The {{music for}} this opera is lost {{except for the}} Lamento d'Arianna, which was {{published}} in the sixth book in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal; a separate monodic version was published in 1623. In its operatic context the lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of <b>futility.</b> Throughout, indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until a descending line brings the piece to a quiet conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The victim, as {{presented}} by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God {{in the manner}} of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad. He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by <b>futility</b> and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as a hallmark of the modern condition.|$|E
5|$|Wheelwright was {{initially}} given until March {{to leave the}} colony, but when ordered not to preach during the interim, he refused, and was then given two weeks to depart the jurisdiction. When asked to give security for his peaceful departure, he declined, but later realized the <b>futility</b> of defiance after spending a night in custody. When directed not to preach during his two weeks of preparation, he again refused, {{and this time the}} court determined that such an injunction was not worth pursuing.|$|E

Turning instinctively {{to look at my}} boys, I happened to meet my wife's eyes. She also had felt profoundly, coming from far away across the grey distances of the sea, the faint boom of the big guns at work on the coast of Flanders--shaping the future.|$|R
2500|$|The urban {{problems}} of Paris had been {{recognized in the}} 18th century; Voltaire complained about the markets [...] "established in narrow streets, showing off their filthiness, spreading infection and causing continuing disorders."

[...] He protested that the government [...] "invested in <b>futilities</b> rather than investing in public works." [...] In 1739 he wrote to the King of Prussia: [...] "I saw the fireworks which they fired off with such management; [...] would rather they started to have a Hôtel de Ville, beautiful squares, magnificent and convenient markets, beautiful fountains, before having fireworks." ...|$|R
60|$|Basset gave a short {{laugh that}} would have done equally well as a snort, if one had {{wanted to make the}} exchange. His {{half-brother}} was in the habit of discovering <b>futilities</b> that were “simply It” at frequently recurring intervals. The discovery generally meant that he flew up to town, preceded by glowingly-worded telegrams, to see some one connected with the stage or the publishing world, got together one or two momentous luncheon parties, flitted in and out of “Gambrinus” for one or two evenings, and returned home with an air of subdued importance and the asparagus tint slightly intensified. The great idea was generally forgotten a few weeks later in the excitement of some new discovery.|$|R
