Why, in their eagerness to get at General Taylor, several Democratic members here have desired to know whether, in case of his election, a bankrupt law is to be established.

6000|$|Neither with Nations {{that become}} miserable is it {{fundamentally}} otherwise. The ancient guides of Nations, Prophets, Priests, or whatever their name, {{were well aware}} of this; and, down to a late epoch, impressively taught and inculcated it. The modern guides of Nations, who also go under a great variety of names, Journalists, Political Economists, Politicians, Pamphleteers, have entirely forgotten this, and are ready to deny this. But it nevertheless remains eternally undeniable: nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> but we shall all be taught it yet, and made again to confess it: we shall all be striped and scourged till we do learn it; and shall at last either get to know it, or be striped to death in the process. For it is undeniable! When a Nation is unhappy, the old Prophet was right and not wrong in saying to it: Ye have forgotten God, ye have quitted the ways of God, or ye would not have been unhappy. It is not according to the laws of Fact that ye have lived and guided yourselves, but according to the laws of Delusion, Imposture, and wilful and unwilful Mistake of Fact; behold therefore the Unveracity is worn out; Nature's long-suffering with you is exhausted; and ye are here! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{death of}} the King was a great blow to what had now come to be {{generally}} styled the 'Conservative Cause.' It was quite unexpected; within a fortnight of his death, eminent persons still believed that 'it was only the hay-fever.' Had his Majesty lived until after the then impending registration, the Whigs would have been again dismissed. Nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> that, under these circumstances, the Conservative Cause would have secured for the new ministers a parliamentary majority. What {{would have been the}} consequences to the country, if the four years of Whig rule, from 1837 to 1841, had not occurred? It is easier to decide what would have been the consequences to the Whigs. Some of their great friends might have lacked blue ribbons and lord-lieutenancies, and some of their little friends comfortable places in the Customs and Excise. They would have lost, undoubtedly, the distribution of four years' patronage; we can hardly say the exercise of four years' power; but they would have existed at this moment as the most powerful and popular Opposition that ever flourished in this country, if, indeed, the course of events had not long ere this carried them back to their old posts in a proud and intelligible position. The Reform Bill did not do more injury to the Tories, than the attempt to govern this country without a decided Parliamentary majority did the Whigs. The greatest of all evils is a weak government. They cannot carry good measures, they are forced to carry bad ones.|$|E
6000|$|But, {{as we have}} seen, it is {{asserted}} that I have no business to call myself an agnostic; that if I am {348} not a Christian I am an infidel; and that I ought to call myself by that name of [...] "unpleasant significance." [...] Well, I do not care much what I am called by other people, and if I had at my side all those who, since the Christian era, have been called infidels by other folks, I could not desire better company.

But there are several points in Dr. Wace's contention which must be elucidated before I can even think of undertaking to carry out his wishes. I must, for instance, know what a Christian is. Now what is a Christian? By whose authority is the signification of that term defined? <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> that the immediate followers of Jesus, the [...] "sect of the Nazarenes," [...] were strictly orthodox Jews, differing from other Jews not more than the Sadducees, the Pharisees, and the Essenes differed from one another; in fact, only in the belief that the Messiah, for whom the rest of their nation waited, had come? Was not their chief, [...] "James, the brother of the Lord," [...] reverenced alike by Sadducee, Pharisee, and Nazarene? At the famous conference which, according to the Acts, took place at Jerusalem, does not James declare that [...] "myriads" [...] of Jews, who by that time had become Nazarenes, were [...] "all zealous for the Law"? Was not the name of [...] "Christian" [...] first used to denote the converts to the doctrine promulgated by Paul and Barnabas at Antioch? Does the subsequent history of Christianity leave any doubt that, from this time forth, the [...] "little rift within {349} the lute" [...] caused by the new teaching, developed, if not inaugurated, at Antioch, grew wider and wider, until the two types of doctrine irreconcilably diverged? Did not the primitive Nazarenism, or Ebionism, develop into the Nazarenism, and Ebionism, and Elkasaitism of later ages, and finally die out in obscurity and condemnation as damnable heresy; while the younger doctrine throve and pushed out its shoots into that endless variety of sects, of which the three strongest survivors are the Roman and Greek Churches and modern Protestantism? ...|$|E

60|$|This early Christian art of Ireland {{is full of}} {{interest}} to the artist, the archaeologist and the historian. In its rudest forms, such as the little iron hand-bell, the plain stone chalice and the rough wooden staff, it {{brings us back to the}} simplicity of the primitive Christian Church, while to the period of its highest development we owe the great masterpieces of Celtic metal-work. The stone chalice is now replaced by the chalice of silver and gold; the iron bell has its jewel-studded shrine, and the rough staff its gorgeous casing; rich caskets and splendid bindings preserve the holy books of the Saints and, instead of the rudely carved symbol of the early missionaries, we have such beautiful works of art as the processional cross of Cong Abbey. Beautiful this cross certainly is with its delicate intricacy of ornamentation, its grace of proportion and its marvel of mere workmanship, nor <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> about its history. From the inscriptions on it, which are corroborated by the annals of Innisfallen and the book of Clonmacnoise, we learn that it was made for King Turlough O'Connor by a native artist under the superintendence of Bishop O'Duffy, its primary object being to enshrine a portion of the true cross that was sent to the king in 1123. Brought to Cong some years afterwards, probably by the archbishop, who died there in 1150, it was concealed at the time of the Reformation, but at the beginning of the present century was still in the possession of the last abbot, and at his death it was purchased by professor MacCullagh and presented by him to the museum of the Royal Irish Academy. This wonderful work is alone well worth a visit to Dublin, but not less lovely is the chalice of Ardagh, a two-handled silver cup, absolutely classical in its perfect purity of form, and decorated with gold and amber and crystal and with varieties of cloisonne and champleve enamel. There is no mention of this cup, or of the so-called Tara brooch, in ancient Irish history. All that we know of them is that they were found accidentally, the former by a boy who was digging potatoes near the old Rath of Ardagh, the latter by a poor child who picked it up near the seashore. They both, however, belong probably to the tenth century.|$|E

40|$|This paper takes a {{fresh look}} at the land {{dispossession}} that is central to Chinese urbanisation. It documents in detail the property rights changes that occur when village land is taken by a municipal government and analyses the value of those rights by looking at compensation accounts for a case study village in the city of Xiamen in Fujian Province. The purpose of the paper is to show the complexity of the property rights dynamics during land expropriation and the results in terms of villager income. The paper also shows that, in Xiamen, the local state has made a series of concessions such that displaced villagers now receive a compensation package that not only includes compensation for lost agricultural land, production and homes but also a share of the urban land value uplift created by the infrastructure investments of the municipal state. of villager dislocation. Gao (2004), for example, estimated that urban sprawl has resulted in more than 40 million farmers losing their farmland and that the number is increasing by about 2 million per year. Neither <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> that, in giving up their land, villagers are subsidising the real costs of urbanisationâsomething that they are frequently urged to do as a mat-ter of patriotism (He et al., 2008, 2009). What is less clear from published work is the real price, or value, of the rights that are exchanged during the process 1...|$|E
40|$|Introduction] In {{the recent}} past, {{regulatory}} costs {{have received a}} great deal of attention within the Swiss wealth management industry. On the one hand, financial institutions are intensifying their focus on cost management in general, due to the plunge of fees and commissions since the bubble burst on global equity markets. On the other hand, wealth management institutes are faced with rapidly increasing regulatory requirements, leading to a significant rise in their regulatory costs. Neither in theory nor in practice <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>any</b> <b>doubt</b> regarding the economic rationale and the necessity for regulation in the financial industry. Basically, bank regulation is justified as a means of preventing potential market failures in the financial sector, in order to protect depositors and the financial system as a whole: the characteristics of the wealth management business, such as agency problems and asymmetric information, may lead to risky behaviour on the part of wealth management institutes and potential losses for depositors and investors. A crisis in a single financial institute may easily lead to a crisis of confidence in the whole sector, with harmful consequences on monetary transactions and other industries within an economy. Additionally, regulators and supervisors are paying to attract attention to protecting the reputation of the financial industry and financial centres. The prevention of activities such as money laundering and the financing of terrorism is of paramount importance within this context. Yet, despite the positive effects of these regulatory interventions, their cost has to be considered, too. In fact, it is only if the overall benefits of regulation exceed its cost that regulation ultimately yields a profit. Attempts to quantify the cost of regulation can be found in the U. S. and the U. K. In Switzerland, however, there is still a lack of information on the regulatory burden of financial institutions...|$|E
