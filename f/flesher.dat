500|$|A {{few years}} later, the field (which had no common ownership) was {{acquired}} by Joshua <b>Flesher</b> Hanson, a businessman. [...] By this time, Brighton's popularity was such that speculators were commissioning architects and builders to design and lay out large-scale sea-facing residential developments to attract wealthy long-term visitors or permanent residents. [...] Royal Crescent was already thriving; Clarence Square, Russell Square, Marine Parade and New Steine were being developed, and work had started on Bedford Square. [...] Hanson decided to follow the trend but take it in a new direction: he divided Belle Vue Field into 70 plots, leased them individually and put strict covenants in place, demanding that each house be built in a specific style {{in order to ensure}} architectural harmony. [...] In return, the leaseholders (mostly private builders) would have the right to buy, and would end up with houses much larger than average for the town, with excellent sea views and with exclusive access to the large central garden. [...] Most leaseholders bought the houses as soon as they could, which was to Hanson's advantage as he made money and had no ongoing responsibility for the buildings. [...] Restrictions in the covenants included the requirement to erect a façade with an iron balcony, to clad the area below the balcony in stucco, to paint the façade at least every three years, to repair any damage, and to pay towards maintenance of the central garden. [...] No stucco was to be applied above the balcony line.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Chilling injury (CI) {{is a major}} physiolog-ical problem {{limiting}} {{consumption and}} export of peach and nectarine (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch). To clarify the genetic basis for chilling injury, inheritance of the major CI symptoms mealiness, <b>flesh</b> browning, <b>flesh</b> bleeding, and <b>flesh</b> leatheriness were examined over three years in two related peach progenies. In addition, genetic relationships among traits and the year-to-year variation in trait performance in these progenies were tracked. Both populations also segregated for Free-stone-Melting <b>flesh</b> (F-M) and yellow <b>flesh.</b> There were significant differences in CI symptoms among years. The major gene endoPG, which controls the F-M locus, provides resistance to mealiness in non-melting <b>flesh</b> fruit. Only fruit with melting <b>flesh</b> can develop mealiness if the tree possesses other genetic susceptibility factors and/or experiences inducing conditions. The F-M locus also greatly influences susceptibility to <b>flesh</b> bleeding, although the physio-logical mechanism for this disorder is unclear and may be controlled by a different gene closely linked to endoPG. Unlike mealiness, <b>flesh</b> bleeding occurred primarily in non-melting <b>flesh</b> fruit, particularly when the fruit is white-fleshed. <b>Flesh</b> browning incidence was greater in mealy fruit and {{was not associated with}} <b>flesh</b> bleeding. Breeding for CI resistance is thus a viable long-term strategy to reduce losses in the fresh and processed peach and nectarine industries. This study is an important first step to understanding genetic control of CI symptoms in peach...|$|R

In its dominant form the wf gene is responsible for orange <b>flesh</b> color; however, the epistatic interactions of gf and wf can create three <b>flesh</b> colors: orange, white and green. Two F 2 populations, consisting of 77 greenhouse grown and 117 field grown plants, from the cross of ?Sunrise? (white <b>fleshed)</b> by ?TAM Uvalde?

A significant correlation between total soluble solids and beta-carotene content was also found. Molecular markers were identified in both F 2 populations and all significant, associated markers from ?TAM Uvalde? were linked with WF. A single QTL was also found to be linked with the WF locus. The identified QTL can be used to screen potential breeding lines for high beta-carotene. It was also confirmed that the visual ratings of <b>flesh</b> color intensity can be reliably used to select high beta-carotene content melons...|$|R
60|$|She {{was eight}} when her mother’s death made her {{mistress}} {{of the house and}} mother to her little brother, and from that time she scrubbed and mended and baked and sewed, and argued with the <b>flesher</b> about the quarter pound of beef and penny bone which provided dinner for two days (but if you think that this was poverty you don’t know the meaning of the word), and she carried the water from the pump, and had her washing-days and her ironings and a stocking always on the wire for odd moments, and gossiped like a matron with the other women, and humoured the men with a tolerant smile—all these things she did as a matter of course, leaping joyful from bed in the morning because there was so much to do, doing it as thoroughly and sedately as if the brides were already due for a lesson, and then rushing out in a fit of childishness to play dumps or palaulays with others of her age. I see her frocks lengthening, though they were never very short, and the games given reluctantly up. The horror of my boyhood was that I knew a time would come when I also must give up the games, and how it was to be done I saw not (this agony still returns to me in dreams, when I catch myself playing marbles, and look on with cold displeasure); I felt that I must continue playing in secret, and I took this shadow to her, when she told me her own experience, which convinced us both that we were very like each other inside. She had discovered that work is the best fun after all, and I learned it in time, but have my lapses, and so had she.|$|E
