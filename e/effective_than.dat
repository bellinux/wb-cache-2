5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for neonates {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block may be more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> the DPNB. They are more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> a placebo. Topical creams {{have been found to}} irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E

5|$|Some {{evidence}} supports {{the use of}} intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Immune suppression tends to be less <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> in other autoimmune diseases. Prednisolone (a glucocorticoid or steroid) suppresses the immune response, and the steroid-sparing agent azathioprine may replace it once therapeutic effect has been achieved. IVIG may be used {{with a degree of}} effectiveness. Plasma exchange (or plasmapheresis), the removal of plasma proteins such as antibodies and replacement with normal plasma, may provide improvement in acute severe weakness. Again, plasma exchange is less <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> in other related conditions such as myasthenia gravis, and additional immunosuppressive medication is often needed.|$|E

5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 {{has the potential to}} be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E

5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E

40|$|Compliance with {{laws and}} {{regulations}} depends on the expected penalty facing violators.

A key question in the economics of crime literature is whether increasing the probability of punishment is a more <b>effective</b> deterrent <b>than</b> an equivalent increase in the severity of punishment. This paper uses laboratory experiments to investigate this issue, and finds that increasing the severity of punishment is a more <b>effective</b> deterrent <b>than</b> an equivalent increase in the probability of punishment.

5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less <b>effective</b> <b>than</b> antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E
