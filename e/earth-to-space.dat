50|$|In the past, {{alignment}} of laser beams {{was done with}} irises. Two irises uniquely defined a beam path; the farther apart the irises and the smaller the iris holes, the better the path was defined. The smallest aperture that an iris can define is about 0.8 mm. In comparison, the centroid of a laser beam can be determined to sub-micrometre accuracy with a laser beam profiler. The laser beam profiler's effective aperture size is three orders of magnitude smaller than that of an iris. Consequently, the ability to define an optical path is 1000 times better when using beam profilers over irises. Applications that need microradian alignment accuracies include <b>earth-to-space</b> communications, <b>earth-to-space</b> ladar, master oscillator to power oscillator alignment, and multi-pass amplifiers.|$|E

The resonant frequency is calculated as the position of the slots is shifted from the right endpoint to the left endpoint on the patch between − 4. 2 mm ≤ Xslot ≤ 4. 2 mm with the steps of 0. 1 mm. The designed antenna is proposed for downlink of X band satellite, broadcasting satellite service, fixed-satellite service uplink, satellite (<b>Earth-to-space),</b> radio navigation, mobile-satellite (<b>Earth-to-space),</b> and KU band which can be achieved at the resonant frequencies of 7. 2 GHz, 12. 2 GHz, 14. 6 GHz, 17. 5 GHz and 19. 3 GHz. Next, High Frequency Electromagnetic Field Simulation software (ANSYS HFSS) results for the prototype microstrip antenna are compared with the values obtained through ANFIS system. It can be concluded that the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system in such designs can be conveniently used due to fuzzy system’s high approximation capability and much faster convergence rate. The best results for our ANFIS system can be obtained if Gaussian membership is used which leads to the mean absolute error of 1. 4653...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of an <b>Earth-to-space</b> optical telecommunications system is de-graded by distortion (scintillation and tilt) {{of the beam}} as it propagates through the turbulent atmosphere. Conventional approaches to correct distortions {{that are based on}} natural or artiflcial guide stars are useful in, for example, astronomical imaging, but have practical di–culties or are not adequate to correct the distortions important for Earth-to-deep-space optical links. A beam-relay approach that over-comes these di–culties is presented. A downward-directed laser near an orbiting relay mirror provides a reference source for measuring and correcting atmospheric distortion. The ground station preprocesses its uplink communications beam such that, after passage through the atmosphere, uplink propagation efiects are removed, delivering a difiraction-limited beam to the mirror. The orbiting mirror then directs the corrected beam to the distant spacecraft. We discuss this system. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{conversion}} of most available hourly rainfall data to 1 -minute integration time rain rate statistic is imperative for accurate estimation of attenuation due to rain {{employed in the}} design of both terrestrial and <b>earth-to-space</b> microwave systems. 2 -year rainfall data collected at Ogbomoso, South-west region of Nigeria, between the periods of 2009 and 2010 was used in the analysis. Result shows that a power law relationship exists between the equiprobable rain rates of two different integration times. The regression coefficients a and b obtained are slightly different from the ITU-R recommendation. The conversion factor obtained at Ogbomoso is lower compared to Ile-Ife, in the South-west region of the country. The disagreement is attributed to the effect of global warming hitting the whole universe most especially the tropical regions. This study also reveals that different conversion factors are required for different locations even within the same climatic region...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} {{microwave}} communication systems requires {{knowledge of the}} one-minute cumulative distribution of rainfall. However, since time series of rainfall fulfilling this constrain are not common, the conversion of a distribution obtained from time series with a longer integration time T (such as 30 or 60 minutes) into equivalent one-minute distribution has been proposed as an alternative. This paper reviews existing models for the conversion of cumulative distributions of rainfall and compares their predictions against a database of measured distributions from the Aburrá Valley {{in the department of}} Antioquia, with a view towards recommending a model suitable for the Colombian climate. Based on the results of the evaluation, the EXCELL RSC model represents a suitable alternative for rainfall rate predictions in the valley, and the best alternative for predictions in other regions in Colombia.

40|$|Since their dawning, space {{communications}} {{have been}} among the strongest driving applications for the development of error correcting codes. Indeed, space-to-Earth telemetry (TM) links have extensively exploited advanced coding schemes, from convolutional codes to Reed-Solomon codes (also in concatenated form) and, more recently, from turbo codes to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. The efficiency of these schemes has been extensively proved in several papers and reports. The situation is a bit different for <b>Earth-to-space</b> telecommand (TC) links. Space TCs must reliably convey control information as well as software patches from Earth control centers to scientific payload instruments and engineering equipment onboard (O/B) spacecraft. The success of a mission may be compromised because of an error corrupting a TC message: a detected error causing no execution or, even worse, an undetected error causing a wrong execution. This imposes strict constraints on the maximum acceptable detected and undetected error rates...|$|E

40|$|In <b>Earth-to-Space</b> communications, {{well-known}} propagation effects such as {{path loss}} and atmospheric loss {{can lead to}} fluctuations in {{the strength of the}} communications link between a satellite and its ground station. Additionally, the typically unconsidered effect of shadowing due to the geometry of the satellite and its solar panels can also lead to link degradation. As a result of these anticipated channel impairments, NASA's communication links have been traditionally designed to handle the worst-case impact of these effects through high link margins and static, lower rate, modulation formats. The work presented in this paper aims to relax these constraints by providing an improved trade-off between data rate and link margin through utilizing link adaptation. More specifically, this work provides a simulation study on the propagation effects impacting NASA's SCaN Testbed flight software-defined radio (SDR) as well as proposes a link adaptation algorithm that varies the modulation format of a communications link as its signal-to-noise ratio fluctuates.

The potential applications of the launcher include nuclear waste disposal into space, deep space probe launches, and atmospheric research. Examples of performance requirements of the ESRL system are a maximum acceleration of 10, 000 g's for nuclear waste disposal in space (NWDS) missions and 2, 500 g's for earth orbital missions, a 20 km/sec launch velocity for NWDS missions, and a launch azimuth of 90 degrees E.

For earth orbital missions, a significant projectile mass was approximately 6. 5 MT, and an integral distributed energy store launch system demonstrated a good potential performance.

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss {{a number of}} {{technologies}} and design philosophies leveraged from commercial industry that AeroAstro has applied {{to the development of}} a new spacecraft communications subsystem. Although there has been a recent push toward reducing spacecraft mass and cost, there is no commercially available communications equipment that will significantly contribute to that reduction.

40|$|Three {{adaptive}} line enhancer (ALE) algorithms and architectures - namely, conventional ALE, ALE {{with double}} filtering, and ALE with coherent accumulation - are investigated for fast carrier acquisition {{in the time}} domain. The advantages of these algorithms are their simplicity, flexibility, robustness, and applicability to general situations including the <b>Earth-to-space</b> uplink carrier acquisition and tracking of the spacecraft. In the acquisition mode, these algorithms act as bandpass filters; hence, the carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR) is improved for fast acquisition. In the tracking mode, these algorithms simply act as lowpass filters to improve signal-to-noise ratio; hence, better tracking performance is obtained. It {{is not necessary to}} have a priori knowledge of the received signal parameters, such as CNR, Doppler, and carrier sweeping rate. The implementation of these algorithms is in the time domain (as opposed to the frequency domain, such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT)).

40|$|International audienceRecent {{technology}} {{advances have}} made CubeSats {{not only an}} affordable means of access to space, but also promising platforms {{to develop a new}} variety of space applications. In this paper, we explore the idea of using nanosatellites as access points to provide extended coverage to the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine-to- Machine (M 2 M) communications. This study is mainly motivated by two facts: on the one hand, it is already obvious that the number of machine-type devices deployed globally will experiment an exponential growth over the forthcoming years. This trend is pushed by the available terrestrial cellular infrastructure, which allows adding support for M 2 M connectivity at marginal costs. On the other hand, the same growth is not observed in remote areas that must rely on space-based connectivity. In such environments, the demand for M 2 M communications is potentially large, yet it is challenged by the lack of cost-effective service providers. The traffic characteristics of typical M 2 M applications translate into the requirement for an extremely low cost per transmitted message. Under these strong economical constraints, we expect that nanosatellites in the low Earth orbit will play a fundamental role in overcoming the IoT digital divide. The objective of this paper is therefore to provide a general analysis of a nanosatellite-based, machine-type data collection network aiming to extend coverage for the IoT. We put emphasis in the engineering challenges faced in designing the <b>Earth-to-Space</b> communication link, where the adoption of an efficient multiple-access scheme is paramount for ensuring connectivity to a large number of terminal nodes. In this context, we overview {{the state of the art}} of current developments and propose a novel access approach suitable for delay-tolerant applications.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for global wideband satellite communication services on vessels {{has led to}} applications that enable Earth Stations on board Vessels (ESVs) to use Fixed-Satellite Service (FSS) networks operating in the uplink band 14 - 14. 5 GHz. The broadband communication solution requested from these kinds of vessels can only be provided by using the ESV services - today offered by several telecommunication operators. Transmitting capacity may vary between 19. 2 kbit/s up to 1 - 2 Mbit/s. From the International Radio Regulatory view, {{in accordance with the}} Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union, the 14 - 14. 5 GHz band is allocated to the Mobile-Satellite Service (<b>Earth-to-Space),</b> except to the Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service (AMSS) on a secondary basis, to the Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) on a primary basis in all ITU regions and to the Fixed Service (FS) in many countries through Radio Regulations Article 5 footnotes. Hence, whichever operational frequency for the mobile earth station is chosen within 14 - 14. 5 GHz, there may be a need to consider the potential interference caused to the FS receivers. Particularly, in the case of mobile earth stations installed on vessels, interference problems may be created to the Fixed Service receivers placed near the coastline or on small islands. For countries like Greece, the problem is even more intense since there are many islands where Fixed Service links may be deployed and a great number of vessels equipped with Earth Stations operating in the 14 / 11 GHz band travel throughout Aegean Sea every day especially during summer. This paper examines the potential interference from earth stations on vessels to Fixed Service receivers in the 14 GHz band when the vessels are traveling close to the coastline. The parameters that {{have an impact on the}} interference calculations are presented and simulations are conducted for various realistic interference scenarios. It is shown that, the interference caused to the Fixed Service receivers is negligible if some operational limits are imposed to the vessels equipped with Earth Stations...|$|E
