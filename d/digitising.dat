5|$|In recent years, the National Archives of Malta {{has been}} {{increasing}} its presence on the Internet, in line with many of its national archival counterparts throughout the world. This effort has included enabling {{members of the public}} to search the records of the Archives online, and view a short description of what is contained in the records found. Other efforts have included the <b>digitising</b> of a number of the Archives' holdings, the release of many of the Archives' publications on its web site, the sale of copies of the Archives' holdings through its 'e-shop', and an online presence for Malta's National Memory Project, dedicated to eternalising the memories of those who have contributed to the history of Malta.|$|E
5|$|The {{master copy}} of the film was stolen from the Adlabs Processing at Film City before its release. When Gowariker learnt about the incident, he lodged a police {{complaint}} immediately. The case {{was taken over by}} the Mumbai Crime Branch. UTV Motion Pictures sent a legal notice to Adlabs Films and UFO Movies, the film's processing and <b>digitising</b> laboratories. It was later revealed that a top official of the lab had sold the master copy for 200,000 rupees to film pirates to make pirated copies of the film to sell in India and overseas. Several people were arrested, including the manager of Adlabs Processing, for allegedly stealing the master copy and producing pirated copies. The print was later recovered by the police, who also found and seized pirated CDs and DVDs produced from the master copy.|$|E
25|$|When <b>digitising</b> {{continuous}} signals, {{for example}} images or sound, {{the overall effect}} {{of a number of}} measurements {{is more important than the}} accuracy of each individual measurement. In these circumstances dithering, and a related technique, error diffusion, are normally used. A related technique called pulse-width modulation is used to achieve analogue type output from an inertial device by rapidly pulsing the power with a variable duty cycle.|$|E

25|$|Error {{diffusion}} {{tries to}} ensure the error on average is minimized. When dealing with a gentle slope from one to zero the output would be zero {{for the first few}} terms until the sum of the error and the current value becomes greater than 0.5, in which case a 1 is output and the difference subtracted from the error so far. Floyd–Steinberg dithering is a popular error diffusion procedure when <b>digitising</b> images.|$|E

25|$|A {{complete}} set of tithe maps, covering almost the whole of Wales, is housed in the National Library. The Welsh Church Commission Collection, which, in 1944, was deposited in the Library, includes the diocesan copies of the tithe maps that were transferred to the Commission in 1920 following the disestablishment of the Church of Wales. They are an important source {{for the study of}} mid-nineteenth century Wales and, therefore, are the most frequently used collection of maps {{and one of the most}} consulted categories of documents in the Library. The Cynefin Project is <b>digitising</b> over 1100 tithe maps and transcribing the appointment documents to link them together. The project is planned for completion in September 2016.|$|E
25|$|The library {{operates}} a strict policy on copying of material. Until fairly recently, personal photocopying of library material was not permitted, {{as there was}} concern that copying and excessive handling would result in damage. However individuals may now copy most material produced after 1900, and a staff-mediated service is provided for certain types of material dated between 1801 and 1900. Handheld scanners and digital cameras are also permitted for use on most post-1900 publications and digital cameras may also be used, with permission, with older material. The Library will supply digital scans of most pre-1801 material. Microform copies have been made {{of many of the}} most fragile items in the library's collection, and these are substituted for the originals whenever possible. The library has a close relationship with the Oxford Digital Library, which {{is in the process of}} <b>digitising</b> some of the many rare and unusual items in the University's collection.|$|E
500|$|The {{restored}} {{version of}} Karnan which utilised DTS 5.1 surround sound, {{was released in}} 72 screens across Tamil Nadu, and was released by Shanthi's Divya Films. It was well received upon release, although The Times of Indias critic M. Suganth called the restoration process [...] "far from perfect", and critic Baradwaj Rangan quoted, [...] "The print occasionally judders, leaving the impression of watching the movie on a screen mounted behind the driver's seat in an auto rickshaw". Taking a big opening, the film collected roughly [...] in Chennai within the first few weeks, and was later reported to have collected a total of [...] It had a theatrical run of over 100 days, and having surpassed what it originally managed to collect in its entire 105-day run at Shanthi theatre, the film was officially declared a commercial success.

500|$|In a 1982 {{survey of}} 10,000 eleven-year-old {{children}} Blyton was voted their most popular writer. She is the world's fourth most-translated author, behind Agatha Christie, Jules Verne and William Shakespeare with her books being translated into 90 languages. From 2000 to 2010, Blyton {{was listed as}} a Top Ten author, selling almost 8 million copies (worth £31.2 million) in the UK alone. In 2003 The Magic Faraway Tree was voted 66 in the BBC's Big Read. [...] In the 2008 Costa Book Awards, Blyton was voted Britain's best-loved author. Her books continue to be very popular among children in Commonwealth nations such as India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malta, New Zealand, and Australia, and around the world. They have also seen a surge of popularity in China, where they are [...] "big with every generation". In March 2004 Chorion and the Chinese publisher Foreign Language Teaching and Research Press negotiated an agreement over the Noddy franchise, which included bringing the character to an animated series on television, with a potential audience of a further 95 million {{children under the age}} of five. Chorion spent around £10 million <b>digitising</b> Noddy, and as of 2002 had made television agreements with at least 11 countries worldwide.|$|E
500|$|Barlow {{decided to}} feature live action footage {{in the game}} after {{becoming}} frustrated with his previous projects, particularly with the technical challenge of translating an actor's performance into a game engine. Barlow set out to work with an actor on Her Story, having enjoyed the process while working at Climax Studio, albeit with a larger budget. He contacted Viva Seifert, whom he had intermittently worked with on [...] for a year, before its cancellation. He felt that Seifert is [...] "very good at picking up a line and intuitively pulling {{a lot of the}} subtext into her performance", which led him to believe that she was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role in Her Story. When Barlow asked Seifert to audition, he sent her a 300-page script, which he managed to reduce to 80 pages, by altering font size, as well as some dialogue; she accepted the role. Seifert began to feel pressure midway through filming, when she realised that [...] "the whole game is hinging" [...] on her performance. She described the shoot as [...] "intense" [...] and [...] "rather exhausting", and felt as if she was [...] "subtly being scrutinised" [...] by Barlow, which helped her performance. Barlow also felt that the intensity helped Seifert's performance, taking cues from director Alfred Hitchcock, who would upset his actors in order to achieve the greatest performance. Seifert felt that there were small nuances in her performance that may have [...] "added some twists and turns" [...] for players that Barlow had not anticipated. The game's seven police interviews were filmed roughly in chronological order over five days, in a process that Barlow called [...] "natural". Barlow travelled to Seifert's home county of Cornwall to film. He felt that finding the locations for the interrogation rooms was the simplest part of production, because [...] "everywhere has crappy looking rooms", with footage being recorded in a council building in Truro. When filming was complete, Barlow wanted {{to give the impression that}} the videos had been recorded in 1994, but found digital filters were unable to capture this time frame appropriately. Instead, he recorded the footage through two VHS players to create imperfections in the video before <b>digitising</b> the video into the game.|$|E

2500|$|Under the {{original}} throwing Laws of Cricket, the umpires officiating were under {{an obligation to}} call [...] "no-ball" [...] to a delivery {{that they were not}} entirely happy was absolutely fair. This Law gave the umpires absolutely no discretion. In 2000, the Laws were changed to put an allowable figure of straightening of 5° for spinners, 7.5° for medium pacers and 10° for fast bowlers in an attempt to more clearly define what was legal. But these figures proved difficult to enforce due to umpires being unable to discern actual amounts of straightening and the differentiation between the three different allowable figures. Testing in Test Match conditions is not currently possible [...] "when the identification of elbow and shoulder joint centres in on-field data collection, where a shirt is worn, also involves large errors. In a match the ability to differentiate anatomical movements such as 'elbow extension' by <b>digitising</b> segment end-points, particularly if you have segment rotations, is extremely difficult and prone to error. This is certainly the case with spin bowlers. It is therefore not surprising that laboratory testing is preferred, particularly for spin bowlers, where an appropriate pitch length and run-up can be structured. This is clearly the only way to test players, where data would be able to withstand scientific and therefore legal scrutiny." ...|$|E

40|$|Research problem: Little {{is known}} about Māori <b>digitised</b> resources. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to explore the factors that influence Māori students’ and staff decisions to use or not use Māori <b>digitised</b> resources within a polytechnic and to examine {{the ways in which they}} are used and identify the reasons for their use. Methodology: An indigenous paradigm called Kaupapa Māori research and the Māori Tertiary Education Framework were used to investigate the viewpoints of the participants. Additionally, Rogers’ diffusion of innovations theory was used to understand aspects about how and why participants adopt and use <b>digitised</b> resources. Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data from a purposive sample of five Māori students and four Māori staff. Results: Several factors such as teaching Māori research, learning Te Reo Māori and personal reasons positively influenced the attitude of individuals to enjoy using Māori <b>digitised</b> resources. Most individuals felt comfortable using them and several suggestions were made around improving their use and these included training, technologies enhancements and further investigation. Implications: The digital shift from using traditional methods to using the internet to find and use Māori <b>digitised</b> resources is having an effect on library users. It has changed the way Māori have access to Māori <b>digitised</b> resources and will continue to influence how Māori students and staff learn. Further investigation should be undertaken to see how Māori students and staff at other New Zealand polytechnics and University use Māori <b>digitised</b> resources...|$|R
