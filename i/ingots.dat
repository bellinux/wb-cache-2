5|$|Crucible {{steel is}} steel {{that has been}} melted in a {{crucible}} rather than having been forged, {{with the result that}} it is more homogeneous. Most previous furnaces could not reach high enough temperatures to melt the steel. The early modern crucible steel industry resulted from the invention of Benjamin Huntsman in the 1740s.

40|$|Shrinkage {{porosity}} defect {{is often}} found in an air cooled jumbo steel <b>ingot,</b> which will influence {{the quality of the}} final rolled plates. In practical production, some rolled plates are frequently rejected due to the serious shrinkage porosity of the <b>ingot.</b> To improve the quality of the <b>ingot,</b> a new cooling method, gradient cooling process (in which {{the upper part of the}} <b>ingot</b> is air cooled and the lower part is spray cooled) was put forward in this study. The solidification behaviors for a 60 t jumbo slab <b>ingot</b> under gradient cooling condition were simulated using the ProCast software, and the results were compared with those of an <b>ingot</b> by air cooling condition. The solidifying tendency, temperature field and distribution of shrinkage porosities in the <b>ingot</b> under different cooling conditions were analyzed. Simulation results show that under gradient cooling condition the solidification of the slab <b>ingot</b> progresses in an upward manner along the vertical z axis and in a centripetal manner along the horizontal x and y axes. Gradient cooling can efficiently reduce shrinkage porosity of the jumbo slab <b>ingot</b> by optimizing the solidification sequence, and making the position of shrinkage porosity move from near the middle height of the <b>ingot</b> (under air cooling condition) towards the head of the ingot; and the secondary shrinkage is eliminated. In addition, the solidification time of the <b>ingot</b> under gradient cooling is 7. 3 h in this simulation, which is 2. 7 h faster than that under air cooling. A 60 t jumbo slab <b>ingot</b> was successfully produced under gradient cooling condition. The <b>ingot</b> was rolled to a plate with a thickness of 100 mm and length of 18, 000 mm, and ultrasonic flaw detection was performed. Some porosity was found along the axis of the plate at 4, 900 - 6, 000 mm from the head of the plate, indicating that the position of the defect is moved towards the head of the <b>ingot.</b> This distribution trend of the defect is consistent with the simulated result...|$|R

The only uranium metal available commercially was produced by the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company, using a photochemical process that produced <b>ingots</b> the size of a quarter that were sold for around $20 per gram. Edward Creutz, the head of the group responsible for fabricating the uranium, wanted a metal sphere the size of an orange for his experiments.

5|$|Some {{scholars}} do {{not believe}} that Prince Iziaslav Yaroslavych, whose Christian name was Demetrius, first built the Saint Demetrius's Monastery and Church in the Uppertown of Kiev near Saint Sophia Cathedral in the 1050s.

One reason for building the church may have been Svyatopolk's recent victory over the nomadic Polovtsians, as Michael the Archangel was considered a patron of warriors and victories.
