5|$|Most of {{the bridges}} which cross the river are movable, to allow {{shipping}} to pass. There are six swing bridges; four bascule bridges, {{two of which}} have twin leaves, one for each carriageway of the roads which they carry; and three Scherzer lift bridges, which are a type of rolling bascule bridge. Scott Street Bridge, which is now permanently raised, was originally powered from a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> main maintained by the first public power distribution company in the world.|$|E
5|$|Before Rommel was {{assigned}} {{defense of the}} Atlantic Wall, obstacles to amphibious landing were being built upon the beaches of Belgium and France. On February 3, 1944 {{during a visit to}} the beach at Neufchâtel-Hardelot, Rommel was shown a method by which local troops employed a <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> hose to quickly create a hole in beach sand, one which could be used to set high wooden stakes (Hochpfähle) into the beach as an obstacle to landing craft. The water hose method took three minutes, fifteen times faster than using a pile driver. Rommel ordered such methods to be used to place wooden beams, metal rails and other obstructions along the beaches of Normandy. Nearly 11,000 were emplaced in the south part of Normandy's coastline where the Allies would eventually land.|$|E
25|$|The use of high {{pressure}} and ultra <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> {{has been used}} to clean various coatings on concrete surfaces for the purpose of repair and reapplication. Coatings are used to protect concrete from the elements, rain, salt, and to create a friendlier surface for human use. Concrete can also be covered with carpet or tiles using a heavy duty glue or mastic. <b>High</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> can be used to clean these materials off when new carpet or tiles are desired.|$|E

50|$|The vapour <b>pressure</b> of <b>water</b> is the <b>pressure</b> {{at which}} <b>water</b> vapour is in {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium with its condensed state. At <b>higher</b> <b>pressures</b> <b>water</b> would condense. The <b>water</b> vapour <b>pressure</b> is the partial <b>pressure</b> of <b>water</b> vapour in any gas mixture in equilibrium with solid or liquid water. As for other substances, <b>water</b> vapour <b>pressure</b> {{is a function}} of temperature and can be determined with the Clausius-Clapeyron relation.|$|R
25|$|Pressurized {{water is}} used in water {{blasting}} and water jet cutters. Also, very <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> guns are used for precise cutting.

50|$|The water {{engine is}} a positive-displacement engine, often closely {{resembling}} a steam engine with similar pistons and valves, that {{is driven by}} <b>water</b> <b>pressure.</b> The supply of water was derived from a natural head of water, the water mains, or a specialised high-pressure water supply such as that provided by the London Hydraulic Power Company. Water mains in the 19th century often operated at pressures of 30 to 40 psi, while hydraulic power companies supplied <b>higher</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> at anything up to 800 psi.|$|R

25|$|Fixed cone valves are {{designed}} to dissipate the energy from a water flow during reservoir discharge. They are a round pipe section with an adjustable sleeve gate and cone at the discharge end. Flow is varied by moving the sleeve away or towards its cone seat. The design allows <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> {{from the base of}} a dam to be released without causing erosion to the surrounding environment. Fixed cone valves are able to handle heads up to 300 m.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} atmospheres of {{the solar}} system's gas giant planets are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium at temperatures well above their critical points. The gaseous outer atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn transition smoothly into the dense liquid interior, while {{the nature of the}} transition zones of Neptune and Uranus is unknown. Theoretical models of extrasolar planets 55 Cancri e and Gliese 876 d have posited an ocean of pressurized, supercritical fluid water with a sheet of solid <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> ice at the bottom.|$|E
25|$|In 1919 the Uniformed Firefighters Association was formed. Tower ladders and the SuperPumper System were {{introduced}} in 1965. Major apparatus of the SuperPumper System (the SuperPumper and the SuperTender) was phased out in 1982, {{in favor of the}} Maxi-Water Unit. But the 5 Satellite Units of the system, together with the Maxi-Water Unit (known as Satellite 6 since 1999) are still actively used as of 2007 for multiple alarm fires and certain other incidents. These are now called the Satellite Water System. Other technical advances included the introduction of <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> systems, the creation of a Marine fleet, adoption of vastly improved working conditions and the utilization of improved radio communications.|$|E
50|$|Exploration at Adhi {{began in}} 1956 and {{continued}} {{for a decade}} during which four wells were drilled. But {{all of them were}} abandoned due to insurmountable <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> formation <b>water</b> inflows and subsurface complications.|$|R
50|$|At <b>high</b> <b>pressures,</b> <b>water</b> has {{a complex}} phase diagram with 15 known phases {{of ice and}} several triple points {{including}} ten whose coordinates are shown in the diagram. For example, the triple point at 251 K (−22 °C) and 210 MPa (2070 atm) corresponds to the conditions for the coexistence of ice Ih (ordinary ice), ice III and liquid water, all at equilibrium. There are also triple points for the coexistence of three solid phases, for example ice II, ice V and ice VI at 218 K (−55 °C) and 620 MPa (6120 atm).|$|R

25|$|Repair {{works were}} {{estimated}} at about €60 million. On 18 October, the investigation authority released the damaged section of tunnel back to Eurotunnel who then assessed the tunnel lining and replaced over one thousand bolts holding the concrete lining. The damaged concrete was then removed with <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> jets, {{damage to the}} reinforcing steel mesh repaired and a new concrete lining applied by a shotcreting process. This used about 4000 tonnes of new concrete and was completed in early January 2009. During the remainder of January, tunnel equipment was repaired and replaced as necessary, with the installation of overhead line equipment on 28 January. After test running, Eurotunnel reopened on 9 February 2009.|$|E
500|$|It is not {{designed}} for use in fire streams. [...] The airtight nature of hard suction hose, necessary for drafting, renders the hose unsuitable for the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> flow needed to spray a pressurized stream of water on a fire. [...] Thus, hard suction hose is {{tested for the ability}} to [...] "prevent collapse under vacuum conditions" [...] rather than its ability to function as an attack hoseline.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, Buffalo's waterfront was an extremely busy center of commerce. Grain elevators, warehouses and shipping traffic had overtaxed the two existing fireboats: John T. Hutchinson (Engine 23) and George R. Potter (Engine 29). Also, the city of Buffalo had shoreline hookups to allow the fireboats to serve as floating pumping stations supplying <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> to a fire hydrant system that covered the downtown area. [...] The decision was made by city officials to order a third boat that would also have icebreaking capability along with her normal firefighting duties.|$|E
50|$|The <b>high</b> <b>pressure,</b> <b>high</b> flow <b>water</b> {{injection}} pumps are placed {{near to the}} de-oxygenation tower and boosting pumps.

500|$|Pulverised Fuel Ash (PFA) and Furnace Bottom Ash (FBA) were {{byproducts}} produced {{through the}} burning of coal in the station. Bottom ash was removed from ash hoppers {{at the bottom of}} the boilers by <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> jets. It then travelled to ash settling ponds via sluiceways. For much of the station's life, the station was served by a series of barges, which took the ash to dump [...] out into the North Sea. Two barges provided this service over the years; Sir Fon and MVA. The barges were loaded by silos situated at a special dock to the east of the stations. However, dumping in the sea stopped in 1992 when the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships prevented further dumping in the North Sea. From then on FBA was sold to the construction industry, while PFA was either dried for sale, or was disposed of at a licensed landfill on-site.|$|E
2500|$|... {{all types}} of {{surfaces}} can get dirty from excessive use and abuse, water and air pollution and general exposure to the elements. These surfaces can be cleaned using <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> or <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> mixed with an abrasive.|$|E
2500|$|Garnet sand {{is a good}} abrasive, and {{a common}} {{replacement}} for silica sand in sand blasting. [...] Alluvial garnet grains which are rounder {{are more suitable for}} such blasting treatments. Mixed with very <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water,</b> garnet is used to cut steel and other materials in water jets. For water jet cutting, garnet extracted from hard rock is suitable since it is more angular in form, therefore more efficient in cutting.|$|E
50|$|Civil {{engineering}} structures are often subjected to very extreme forces, such as large variations in temperature, dynamic loads such as waves or traffic, or <b>high</b> <b>pressures</b> from <b>water</b> or compressed gases.

2500|$|While most of {{the danger}} of lasers comes from the beam itself, there are certain non-beam hazards that are often {{associated}} with use of laser systems. [...] Many lasers are high voltage devices, typically 400nbsp&V upward for a small 5nbsp&mJ pulsed laser, and exceeding many kilovolts in higher powered lasers. This, coupled with <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> for cooling the laser and other associated electrical equipment can create a greater hazard than the laser beam itself.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial and {{military}} airfields {{are required to}} maintain certain levels of friction on runways to prevent planes from skidding. Runway design, weather and amount of rubber remaining from tire wear all {{play a role in}} the level of friction of a landing strip. [...] If too much rubber is present, the friction of the landing strip will be less, requiring more distance for landings, especially in wet weather. <b>High</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> can be used to remove rubber and restore required friction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} hydro {{scarification}} (a.k.a. hydroscarification or scarification) uses ultra <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>water</b> {{to remove the}} top surface of a concrete bridge or road surface. Usually the removal is within 1/4" [...] to 3/4" [...] at the most, but can be of any depth above {{the top layer of}} rebar. Removal of this type is done in order to provide a good microfracture-free surface for bonding with new, sound concrete. Much like applying oil and chips to an asphalt road, this helps extend the useful life of the bridge decking and road surface by delaying the need for complete replacement.|$|E
50|$|One example {{concerns}} crystallization of melts {{that form}} mafic and ultramafic rocks.
