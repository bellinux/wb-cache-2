5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E

The men of the militia returned triumphantly to Galena, Illinois bearing the scalps of two Sauk warriors they had slain. The battle helped raise public opinion towards the militia.

5|$|Amanita bisporigera {{belongs to}} section Phalloideae {{of the genus}} Amanita, which {{contains}} some of the deadliest Amanita species, including A.phalloides and A.virosa. This classification has been upheld with phylogenetic analyses, which <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> toxin-producing members of section Phalloideae form a clade—that is, they derive from a common ancestor. In 2005, Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of several white-bodied toxic Amanita species, {{most of which are}} found in Asia. Their results support a clade containing A. bisporigera, A.subjunquillea var. alba, A.exitialis, and A.virosa. The Guangzhou destroying angel (Amanita exitialis) has two-spored basidia, like A.bisporigera.|$|E
5|$|Due to the Parisian uprisings {{during the}} Fronde civil war, Louis XIV moved his court {{to a new}} palace, Versailles, in 1682. Although no longer the capital of France, arts and {{sciences}} in the city flourished with the Comédie-Française, the Academy of Painting, and the French Academy of Sciences. To <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> city was safe from attack, the king had the city walls demolished and replaced with tree-lined boulevards that would become the Grands Boulevards of today. Other marks of his reign were the Collège des Quatre-Nations, the Place Vendôme, the Place des Victoires, and Les Invalides.|$|E

This makes the retention controversy moot since the virus can be easily recreated even if all samples are destroyed.

Mechanistically, the reaction proceeds with potassium hydroxide deprotonating a methyl group and the resulting carbanion undergoing nucleophilic substitution with methyl iodide to form a new carbon–carbon bond.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixth book, Clement intends to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> works of Greek poets were derived from the prophetic books of the Bible. In order to reinforce his position that the Greeks were inclined towards plagiarism, he cites numerous instances of such inappropriate appropriation by classical Greek writers, reported second-hand from On Plagiarism, an anonymous 3rd century BC work sometimes ascribed to Aretades. Clement then digresses to the subject of sin and hell, arguing that Adam was not perfect when created, but given the potential to achieve perfection. He espouses broadly universalist doctrine, holding that Christ's promise of salvation is available to all, even those condemned to hell.|$|E

This interpretation, however, is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community. Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13cm show no evidence for water ice deposits.|$|E
5|$|The BORAX Experiments were {{a series}} of {{destructive}} tests of boiling water reactors conducted by Argonne National Laboratory in Idaho. The BORAX-1 test was conducted under Zinn's supervision in 1954.

He shouted to Harold Lichtenberg to put the control rods back in again, but Lichtenberg pointed out that one was already flying through the air. Zinn later had to testify on the experiment before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy.|$|E

If one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession. This excludes the possibility of a set belonging to itself. To <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions, von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration, called the method of inner models, which later became an essential instrument in set theory.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} argument among paleontologists {{about whether the}} main wing membranes (brachiopatagia) attached to the hind limbs, and if so, where.

However, modern bats and flying squirrels show considerable variation in the extent of their wing membranes and it is possible that, like these groups, different species of pterosaur had different wing designs. Indeed, analysis of pterosaur limb proportions shows that there was considerable variation, possibly reflecting a variety of wing-plans.|$|E
