40|$|Abstract—In this study, an local {{invariant}} generalized Houghtransform (LI-GHT) {{method is}} proposed for integrated circuit (IC) visual positioning. The original generalized Hough transform (GHT) is robust to external noise; however, {{it is not}} suitable for visual positioning of <b>IC</b> <b>chips</b> due to the four-dimensionality (4 D) of parameter space {{which leads to the}} substantial storage requirement and high computational complexity. The proposed LI-GHT method can reduce the dimensionality of parameter space to 2 D thanks to the rotational invariance of local invariant geometric feature and it can estimate the accuracy position and rotation angle of <b>IC</b> <b>chips</b> in real-time under noise and blur influence. The experiment results show that the proposed LI-GHT can estimate position and rotation angle of <b>IC</b> <b>chips</b> with high accuracy and fast speed.

40|$|The {{research}} aims {{to develop}} an automated vision inspection system of <b>IC</b> <b>chips</b> that used to detect the defects of marking and design shape of <b>IC</b> <b>chips.</b> As a result of higher failure probability of manual inspection system, this automated system is developed. The automated vision system will consists of five main phases which are image acquisition, image enhancement,image,segmentation, comparison on features and decision making. The features will be extracted from the target image using projection profile method. The decision will be made using the trained neural network to identify the four common defects of <b>IC</b> <b>chips</b> which are illegible marking,upside down marking and missing character on chip. The results of the automated system are to determine whether to accept or reject the chip. The results are computed within 10 seconds and have {{a high percentage of}} defects detection which is about 95 %. Through the results obtained, the automated vision inspection system of <b>IC</b> <b>chips</b> can be utilized in the manufacturing field to replace the manual inspection system. It can replace about five to eight inspection experts to reduce the cost of hiring and resources in about 70 %. Other than that, the rate of accuracy and efficiency of detecting the defects are improved by 95 % because the consistency of inspecting the chips is maintained from having variations of judgments by the experts...|$|R

40|$|The {{degeneration}} of {{the outer}} retina usually causes blindness by affecting the photoreceptor cells. However, the ganglion cells, which consist of optic nerves, on the middle and inner retina layers are often intact. The retinal implant, which can partially restore vision by electrical stimulation, soon becomes a focus for research. Although many groups worldwide {{have spent a lot}} of effort on building devices for retinal implant, current state-of-the-art technologies still lack a reliable packaging scheme for devices with desirable high-density multi-channel features. Wireless flexible retinal implants have always been the ultimate goal for retinal prosthesis. In this dissertation, the reliable packaging scheme for a wireless flexible parylene-based retinal implants has been well developed. It can not only provide stable electrical and mechanical connections to the high-density multi-channel (1000 + channels on 5 mm × 5 mm <b>chip</b> area) <b>IC</b> <b>chips,</b> but also survive for more than 10 years in the human body with corrosive fluids. The device is based on a parylene-metal-parylene sandwich structure. In which, the adhesion between the parylene layers and the metals embedded in the parylene layers have been studied. Integration technology for high-density multi-channel <b>IC</b> <b>chips</b> has also been addressed and tested with dummy and real 268 -channel and 1024 -channel retinal <b>IC</b> <b>chips.</b> In addition, different protection schemes have been tried in application to <b>IC</b> <b>chips</b> and discrete components to gain the longest lifetime. The effectiveness has been confirmed by the accelerated and active lifetime soaking test in saline solution. Surgical mockups have also been designed and successfully implanted inside dog's and pig's eyes. Additionally, the electrodes used to stimulate the ganglion cells have been modified to lower the interface impedance and shaped to better fit the retina. Finally, all the developed technologies have been applied on the final device with a dual-metal-layer structure. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} a mechanical model for predicting the cohesive {{failure of a}} periodic array of integrated circuit (<b>IC)</b> <b>chips</b> adhesively bonded to a stretched substrate. A unit cell of the layered structure consisting of the <b>IC</b> <b>chips,</b> adhesive layer, and substrate is modeled as an assembly of two elastic Timoshenko beams, representing the chip and substrate, connected by an elastic interface, representing the adhesive. Accordingly, the stresses and energy release rate (ERR) in the adhesive layer – responsible for the premature cracking of the adhesive and debonding of the <b>IC</b> <b>chips</b> – are identified with the corresponding quantities computed for the elastic interface. Expressions for the adhesive stresses and ERR are given in terms of geometrical dimensions and material properties, combined with integration constants obtained numerically via the multi-segment analysis method. For comparison, the stresses in the adhesive are also computed based on a finite element model, and the ERR is evaluated using the virtual crack-closure technique (VCCT). The analytical predictions and numerical results match fairly well, considering the effects of key factors, such as the distance between adjacent chips, the chip size, the material properties of adhesive and substrate. The interaction between the chips is shown to have relevant effects on the adhesive stresses. In particular, only the mode II contributes to the ERR which increases with {{the ratio of the}} chip size to the distance between the chips and with the compliance of the adhesive and substrate layers...|$|R
