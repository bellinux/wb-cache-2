40|$|Masters of ScienceNampak {{packages}} {{millions of}} cans {{a year and}} {{a very small percentage of}} these cans fail due to many reasons. One of the main reasons that cause 2 - piece food cans to fail is split flanges. Split Flanges arises due to a number of reasons which will be discussed in detail. The focus of this thesis was based on the causes of split flanges in 2 -piece food cans. A study on manufacturing the steel and can making together with packaging fish in these cans was conducted. Another study on the reasons for split flanges occurring in 2 piece cans was conducted done as well. The purpose of the investigation was to check if hydrogen embrittlement could be the cause for split bodies forming in 2 piece food cans. 2 piece cans are drawn and wall ironed from tinplate; the cans were made up of a top and a shaped body. It was this shaped body that went through a considerable amount of stress during manufacture especially at the top of the can, which gave an explanation to why the cans split at the curved area near the flange of the can. According to previous studies done at Nampak R&D more complaints about split bodies were coming from the Fish canneries on the West Coast than the Vegetable canneries. These canneries used the exact same cans to package their product. The difference between the processes at these canneries was the exhaust boxes at the fish canneries. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>box</b> is a long tunnel filled with steam used to precook the fish; the vegetables are not precooked in exhaust boxes. Non metallic inclusions (NMI) was one of the main reason for these split flanges to occur and a reason of particular interest in this research. NMI’s were distributed throughout the steel of the cans and since the same cans were used for the fish and vegetable canneries, they should be failing at the same rate. Yet only complaints came from the fish canneries. So the primary focus of the research was to check if the additional steam process contributed to the formation of split bodies / flanges. We proposed to investigate if hydrogen atoms collect at grain boundaries, vacancies and non metallic inclusions and also to check if the steam accelerated embrittlement. Hydrogen is believed to penetrate right into the bare steel of the cans that were exposed to steam. Hydrogen atoms are being investigated because of their small size, their ability to diffuse through a metal lattice and form hydrogen molecules within the intermetallic vacancies of the metal. The molecules of hydrogen, once formed within the internal structure of the metal, remain trapped because of their larger size and can generate a significant pressure that can contribute to the formation of split bodies. [1] The first step to prove whether H-embrittlement was present in the cans was to check if hydrogen was present. A spectroscopic method namely, elastic recoil detection analysis (ERDA) was used to check if H could be detected using the Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis technique. Several experiments were designed to make sure the technique was suitable for the detection of H. Even though it is known that all metals are susceptible to corrosion and Hembrittlement, the tinplate metals had to be checked in an environment similar to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>box</b> (suspected area causing hydrogen embrittlement) in the factories. Further characterization was done using X-Ray Diffraction to measure the residual stress and relate it to the effects of H-embrittlement. If the H had penetrated into the metal it would cause some distortion in the atomic distances between the atomic planes in Fe atoms and can be measured using XRD. Another effect of hydrogen embrittlement is to reduce the strength in the metal. Tensile tests were performed to measure the strengths of the metal...|$|E

50|$|Yamaha {{produced}} the road going two-stroke motorcycle, {{loosely based on}} the TZ250 Yamaha racing bike. Parallel-twin, reverse cylinder and finally V-twin variants were produced. It evolved as a natural replacement for the popular RD 250/Yamaha RD350LC series of the 1980s. It has the Yamaha Power Valve System (YPVS) which raises and lowers the exhaust port depending on the rpm of the engine. The YPVS servo motor starts to open at about 6,000rpm. In standard form 50 bhp is claimed at 10,000rpm. Although mid 40s is more realistic, and will not rev much above 9,500rpm in standard trim, owing to the restrictive standard <b>exhausts</b> and ignition <b>boxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|In total, the Challenge Stradale {{is up to}} 110 kg (243 lb) {{lighter than}} the {{standard}} Modena if all the lightweight options are specified such as deleted radio, lexan (plexiglass) door window and Alcantara fabric (instead of the leather option). As much as 74 kilograms (207 lb) was taken off on the car by lightening the bumpers, stripping the interior of its sound deadening and carbon mirrors and making the optional Modena carbon seats standard. Resin Transfer Moulding was utilized for the bumpers and skirts, a carry over from the Challenge cars which resulted in lighter bumpers than on the Modena. The engine and transmission weight was slimmed down 11 kg (24 lb) {{through the use of}} a smaller, lighter weight sports (yet still stainless steel) <b>exhaust</b> back <b>box</b> and valved exit pipes. The Challenge Stradale also got Brembo carbon ceramic brakes as standard (which later became standard fitment on the F430) which shaved 16 kg off the curb weight and improved handling by reducing unsprung weight and completely eliminating brake fade. Cars fitted with the center console stereo option, sub speaker box behind the seats and glass side windows re-gained approximately 30 kg over the best selected options (from a weight perspective).|$|R

60|$|There {{was sharp}} {{fighting}} all along and all day, {{for the forest}} was so dense that the hostile lines came almost into contact before fighting was possible. One instance was particularly horrible. After some hours of close engagement my brigade, with foul pieces and <b>exhausted</b> cartridge <b>boxes,</b> was relieved and withdrawn to the road to protect several batteries of artillery--probably two dozen pieces--which commanded an open field {{in the rear of}} our line. Before our weary and virtually disarmed men had actually reached the guns the line in front gave way, fell back behind the guns and went on, the Lord knows whither. A moment later the field was gray with Confederates in pursuit. Then the guns opened fire with grape and canister and for perhaps five minutes--it seemed an hour--nothing could be heard but the infernal din of their discharge and nothing seen through the smoke but a great ascension of dust from the smitten soil. When all was over, and the dust cloud had lifted, the spectacle was too dreadful to describe. The Confederates were still there--all of them, it seemed--some almost under the muzzles of the guns. But not a man of all these brave fellows was on his feet, and so thickly were all covered with dust that they looked {{as if they had been}} reclothed in yellow.|$|R
50|$|The CM250TB {{is based}} on the Honda Superdream CB250N engine but with a {{five-speed}} and not six-speed gearbox. The model is instead characterised by its North American cruiser styling with stepped seat, high handlebars, 'megaphone' exhaust silencers, teardrop-shaped tank and many chromium-plated and polished alloy parts. The quality of the chromium finish and polished alloy meant corrosion was a problem, the outside of the engine casings becoming white and furring up in damp or winter conditions. Particularly vulnerable to deterioration in finish was the <b>exhaust</b> system balance <b>box.</b> Moreover, the front disc brake was also noted as likely to seize as a result of low resistance to corrosion. For the 1982 and 1984 production years, CM250C had a chain drive whilst in the 1983 production year it featured a belt drive. The CM250T has an inverted tooth type camchain and was fitted with Honda Comstar cast alloy wheels as standard.|$|R
40|$|A field noise {{measurement}} {{program has been}} conducted on a standard OH- 6 A helicopter and {{one that had been}} modified by reducing the rotor speed, altering rotor tip shape, and treating the engine exhaust and inlet to reduce the external noise levels. The modifications consisted of extensive aircraft design changes resulting in substantial noise reductions following state-of-art noise reduction techniques. The {{purpose of this study was}} to document the ground noise characteristics of each helicopter during flyover, hover, landing, and take-off operations. Based on an analysis of the measured results, the average of the overall on-track noise levels of the final modified helicopter was approximately 14 db lower than that for the standard helicopter. Narrow-band-spectra data of the hovering helicopter show a reduction in the overall noise due to the reductions achieved for the lifting main and antitorque tail rotor, engine <b>exhaust,</b> and gear <b>box</b> noise for the modified helicopter. The noise results of the test program are found to correlate generally with {{noise measurement}}s made previously on this type of aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Roof bolter occupations in {{underground}} {{coal mines}} continue to experience overexposure to respirable dust. One {{potential source of}} dust in roof bolting operations is the exhaust from the roof bolter dust collection system. A wet <b>exhaust</b> conditioner (water <b>box)</b> has been developed to reduce dust emissions from the exhaust of the vacuum dust collection system on roof bolting machines. The exhaust conditioner consists of a muffler chamber and a water chamber with four internal partitions to direct airflow {{over the surface of}} the water. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health conducted a series of laboratory tests to assess the respirable dust capture ability of this device as compared to the standard exhaust muffler. To determine the dust collection efficiency, both devices were placed in the exhaust stream of a simulated roof bolter dust collection system. Gravimetric samplers were operated upstream and downstream of the exhaust conditioner and muffler to evaluate the ability to capture both respirable coal and limestone dust. Researchers observed a 41 percent reduction in dust concentrations for the water exhaust conditioner in the laboratory configuration. Significant levels of dust deposition in the sampling chambers may have contributed to this effective capture rate...|$|R
40|$|The Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Decommissioning Program has decontaminated and {{demolished}} two filter plenum {{buildings at}} Technical Area 21 (TA- 21). During the project a former hot cell was retrofitted to perform decontamination and size reduction of highly Pu contaminated process exhaust (1, 100 ft) and gloveboxes. Pu- 238 / 239 concentrations were as high a 1 Ci per linear foot and averaged approximately 1 mCi/ft. The Project decontamination {{objective was to}} reduce the plutonium contamination on surfaces below transuranic levels. If possible, metal surfaces were decontaminated further to meet Science and Ecology Group (SEG) waste classification guidelines to enable the metal to be recycled at their facility in oak Ridge, Tennessee. Project surface contamination acceptance criteria for low-level radioactive waste (LLRW), transuranic waste, and SEG waste acceptance criteria will be presented. Ninety percent of all radioactive waste for the project was characterized as LLRW. Twenty percent of this material was shipped to SEG. Process <b>exhaust</b> and glove <b>boxes</b> {{were brought to the}} project decontamination area, an old hot cell in Building 4 North. This paper focuses on process exhaust and glovebox decontamination methodology, size reduction techniques, waste characterization, airborne contamination monitoring, engineering controls, worker protection, lessons learned, and waste minimization.

40|$|In a road {{simulator}} study, {{a significant}} source of sub-micrometer fine particles produced by the road-tire interface was observed. Since the particle size distribution and source strength is dependent on the type of tire used, it is likely that these particles largely originate from the tires, and not the road pavement. The particles consisted most likely of mineral oils from the softening filler and fragments of the carbon-reinforcing filler material (soot agglomerates). This identification was based on transmission electron microscopy studies of collected ultrafine wear particles and on-line thermal treatment using a thermodesorber. The mean particle number diameters were between 15 - 50 nm, similar to those found in light duty vehicle (LDV) tail-pipe <b>exhaust.</b> A simple <b>box</b> model approach was used to estimate emission factors in the size interval 15 - 700 nm. The emission factors increased with increasing vehicle speed, and varied between 3. 7 x 10 (11) and 3. 2 x 10 (12) particles vehicle(- 1) km(- 1) at speeds of 50 and 70 km h(- 1). This corresponds to between 0. 1 - 1 % of tail-pipe emissions in real-world emission studies at similar speeds from a fleet of LDV with 95 % gasoline and 5 % diesel-fueled cars. The emission factors for particles originating from the road-tire interface were, however, similar in magnitude to particle number emission factors from liquefied petroleum gas-powered vehicles derived in test bench studies in Australia 2005. Thus the road-tire interface may be a significant contributor to particle emissions from ultraclean vehicles. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
