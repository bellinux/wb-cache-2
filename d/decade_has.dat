The school was a founding member and currently competes in the Saint Paul City Conference. The school's hockey team has had success, winning four state titles, but in the last <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> suffered from low participation.|$|E
5|$|The MIT {{library system}} {{consists}} of five subject libraries: Barker (Engineering), Dewey (Economics), Hayden (Humanities and Science), Lewis (Music), and Rotch (Arts and Architecture). There are also various specialized libraries and archives. The libraries contain more than 2.9 million printed volumes, 2.4 million microforms, 49,000 print or electronic journal subscriptions, and 670 reference databases. The past <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print {{resources in the}} libraries. Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library {{with an emphasis on}} 20th and 21st-century music and electronic music, the List Visual Arts Center's rotating exhibitions of contemporary art, and the Compton Gallery's cross-disciplinary exhibitions. MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection.|$|E
5|$|The past <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> seen {{enrollment}} {{increase by}} over forty percent at UCF, the acceptance rate {{for first time}} in college students falling from over 60% to near 40% in 2008, and the doubling of expected annual expenses. Since 2000, the university has awarded over 100,000 degrees. UCF is currently the largest university in the nation by terms of undergraduate enrollment, the largest university in Florida, and in 2003 held {{the distinction of being}} the fastest-growing university in the United States. During its Spring 2010 graduation ceremonies, The University of Central Florida awarded its 200,000th degree, less than five years after awarding its 150,000th diploma.|$|E

5|$|Several {{video games}} have either been adapted into or have had {{spin-offs}} {{in the form}} of manga and novels. The first was the novelization of Final FantasyII in 1989, and was followed by a manga adaptation of Final FantasyIII in 1992. The past <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> seen {{an increase in the number}} of non-video game adaptations and spin-offs. Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within has been adapted into a novel, the spin-off game Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles has been adapted into a manga, and Final FantasyXI has had a novel and manga set in its continuity. Seven novellas based on the Final FantasyVII universe have also been released. The Final Fantasy: Unlimited story was partially continued in novels and a manga after the anime series ended. The Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy XIII series have also had novellas and audio dramas released.|$|E

25|$|During the Nicaraguan Revolution in the 1980s, Nicaragua was not {{regarded}} {{as a place to}} travel, which caused a decrease in tourism. However, rapid expansion of the tourist industry over the last <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> made it the nation's second largest industry. Over the last 7 years tourism has grown about 70% nationwide with rates of 10%-16% annually.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} virtual {{cinematography}} {{in the early}} 2000s (<b>decade)</b> <b>has</b> led to an explosion of movies {{that would have been}} impossible to shoot without it.

25|$|The {{architecture}} produced following World War II {{has been}} met with mixed reaction.

25|$|The vast {{majority}} of Stockholm residents work in the service industry, which accounts for roughly 85% of jobs in Stockholm. The almost total absence of heavy industry (and fossil fuel power plants) makes Stockholm one of the world's cleanest metropolises. The last <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> seen {{a significant number of}} jobs created in high technology companies. Large employers include IBM, Ericsson, and Electrolux. A major IT centre is located in Kista, in northern Stockholm.|$|E
25|$|Intensive marine {{aquaculture}} {{in the last}} <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> increased considerably and resulted in considerable adverse environmental impacts. Large discharge volumes of organic matter from uneaten feed and excretory waste from aquacultured species has resulted in high levels of nutrients within coastal waters. Large quantities of nitrogen (~ 75%) excreted from bivalves, salmon and shrimp, enter into the coastal environment, {{with the potential to}} develop algal blooms, and reduce dissolved oxygen in the water.|$|E
25|$|Richmond's urban {{residential}} neighborhoods {{also hold}} particular {{significance to the}} city's fabric. The Fan, the Museum District, Jackson Ward, Carver, Carytown, Oregon Hill and Church Hill (among others) are largely single use town homes and mixed use or full retail/dining establishments. These districts are anchored by large streets such as Franklin Street, Cary Street, the Boulevard, and Monument Avenue. The city's growth in population over the last <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> been concentrated in these areas.|$|E

25|$|The {{flat-headed cat}} is {{primarily}} threatened by wetland and lowland forest destruction and degradation. Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves {{over the past}} <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> been rapid in tropical Asia. The depletion of fish stocks from over-fishing is prevalent in many Asian wetland environments {{and is likely to}} be a significant threat. Expansion of oil palm plantations is currently viewed as the most urgent threat.|$|E
25|$|The {{reforms of}} the 1990s did not achieve their objectives. It had been {{expected}} that privatization would bring investment in new generation, but very little capacity was added {{in the years that}} followed the reform. Moreover, the generation capacity added in the last <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> been mainly dependent on liquid fuels, making the country more vulnerable to rising oil prices. In addition, as mentioned, distribution losses have remained at very high levels (28%). The reform also aimed at implementing gradual changes in electricity tariffs that would reflect costs, which proved to be politically unfeasible.|$|E
25|$|Black bear fat {{was once}} valued as a {{cosmetic}} article that promoted hair growth and gloss. The fat most favoured {{for this purpose}} was the hard white fat found in the body's interior. As {{only a small portion}} of this fat could be harvested for this purpose, the oil was often mixed with large quantities of hog lard. However, animal rights activism over the last <b>decade</b> <b>has</b> slowed the harvest of these animals; therefore the lard from black bears has not been used in recent years for the purpose of cosmetics.|$|E
