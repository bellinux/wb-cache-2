500|$|Many {{fans and}} the press {{interpret}} the song as referring to a psychedelic experience due to lines such as [...] "purple haze all in my brain" [...] and [...] "'scuse me while <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> the sky". [...] However, Hendrix and those closest to him never discussed any connection between psychedelic drugs and the song, although Shapiro admits that, at the time, {{to do so would}} have been [...] "professional suicide". Chandler, who claimed he was present when Hendrix wrote it, later denied suggestions that Hendrix did so while under the influence of psychedelics. [...] Commenting on the lyrics, Shadwick concludes [...] "the music [...] to tell the larger story. [...] Poised effectively between the twin intoxicants of drugs and desire, they could be interpreted to the listener's taste". [...] In concert, Hendrix sometimes substituted lyrics for comic effect; [...] "'scuse me while <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> the sky" [...] was rendered [...] "'scuse me while <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> this guy" [...] (while gesturing towards Mitchell), [...] "'scuse me while <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> that policeman" [...] (at a near riot in Los Angeles), or [...] "'scuse me while I fuck the sky" [...] (during a downpour in Seattle).|$|E
500|$|Meat Loaf {{cried when}} he first heard the song, which [...] "is the only time that's happened."

Referring to lines like 'when <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> you like that', he said that although [...] "I love Jim Steinman", he wouldn't French kiss him.|$|E
500|$|Success on the Turkish front continued, mostly {{attributable}} to Potemkin. He now {{had the opportunity}} to confront the Turks and dictate a peace, but that would mean leaving Catherine. His procrastination soured Catherine's attitude towards him, a situation compounded by Potemkin's choice of the married Princess Paskovia Adreevna Golitsyna (née Shuvalova) as his latest mistress. In the end, Potemkin was given the requisite authority to negotiate with the Turks (and, afterwards, to pursue his Polish ambitions), and dispatched by Catherine back to the south. She sent a note after him, reading [...] "Goodbye my friend, <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> you".|$|E

500|$|Indeed, {{far from}} being a radical or {{threatening}} manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted {{the extent to which the}} character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity; in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: [...] "'Behold!' and she took his [...] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself slowly down till one knee for an instant touched the ground – 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord! Behold!' and she kissed him on the lips, 'in token of my wifely love do <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> my lord'." [...] Ayesha declares this to be the [...] "first most holy hour of completed womanhood".|$|E
500|$|... "No Better" [...] is an electropop and trip hop ballad with hip hop elements. The song has {{a similar}} {{sonority}} {{to that of other}} songs from Pure Heroine, featuring Lorde's [...] "feathery" [...] vocals and minimal production. It incorporates [...] "woozy" [...] basslines, and [...] "pulsing" [...] synthesisers in its instrumentation, making the song's melody [...] "dreamy", according to Whitney Phaneuf of HitFix. Lyrically, the song features Lorde [...] " [...] an infatuation that deepens as the seasons change". At the first verse, she sings [...] "We roll in every summer when there's strength in our numbers / And your breath's hot and gross but <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> you like a lover". During the chorus the bass beat becomes more intense as Lorde sings [...] "Go all the way / Have your fun, have it all".|$|E
500|$|When {{military}} activity resumed {{in the winter}} of 1807, Napoleon hoped to overwhelm a Russian rear guard at Hof near Eylau, which was called [...] "Preussisch Eylau" [...] (and is now within the borders of the Russian Kaliningrad Oblast). He ordered his dragoons to take a bridge; they failed and suffered severe casualties. D'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers—heavy cavalry of big men on big horses—thundered over the bridge and scattered the Russian rear guard. As the retreating infantry fled, d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers captured four guns and two standards. Napoleon was so pleased with d'Hautpoul and his cuirassiers that he embraced the six-foot man in front of his division the next day. In his own turn, d'Hautpoul was so pleased that he announced first, to have such a compliment, he must be willing to die for his emperor, and second, to his troops: [...] "The Emperor has embraced me on behalf of all of you. And I am so pleased with you that <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> all your arses." ...|$|E

500|$|Kemper {{also had}} a dark fantasy life: he {{performed}} rites with his younger sister's dolls that culminated in him removing their heads and hands, and, on one occasion, when his elder sister, Susan Hughey Kemper (1943–2014), teased him and asked why he {{did not try to}} kiss his teacher, he replied: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> her, I'd have to kill her first." [...] He also recalled that as a little boy, he would sneak out of his house and, armed with his father's bayonet, go to his second-grade teacher's house to watch her through the windows. Kemper stated in later interviews that as a child some of his favorite games to play were [...] "Gas Chamber" [...] and [...] "Electric Chair", in which he asked his younger sister to tie him up, flip an imaginary switch and then he would tumble over and writhe on the floor, pretending to be dying of gas inhalation or electric shock. He also had two near-death experiences as a child, once when his elder sister tried to push him in front of a train, and another when she successfully pushed him into the deep end of a swimming pool, where he almost drowned.|$|E
500|$|Roosevelt {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with Associated Press (AP) reporter Lorena Hickok, who covered her during the last months of the presidential campaign and [...] "fell madly in love with her". During this period, Roosevelt wrote daily 10- to 15-page letters to [...] "Hick", who was planning to write a biography of the First Lady. The letters included such endearments as, [...] "I want to put my arms around you & kiss you at the corner of your mouth," [...] and, [...] "I can't kiss you, so <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> your 'picture' good night and good morning!" [...] At Franklin's 1933 inauguration, Eleanor wore a sapphire ring Hickok had given her. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover despised Roosevelt's liberalism, her stance regarding civil rights, and her and her husband FDR's criticisms of Hoover's surveillance tactics, and so Hoover maintained a large file on Roosevelt, which the filmmakers of the biopic J. Edgar (2011) indicate included compromising evidence of this relationship, which Hoover intended to blackmail Roosevelt with. Compromised as a reporter, Hickok soon resigned her position with the AP to be closer to Eleanor, who secured her a job as an investigator for a New Deal program.|$|E
500|$|The Jazz Singer had its European sound premiere at the Piccadilly Theatre in London on September 27, 1928. According to film {{historian}} Rachael Low, [...] "Many in {{the industry}} realized at once that a change to sound production was inevitable." [...] On January 16, 1929, the first European feature film with a synchronized vocal performance and recorded score premiered: the German production Ich küsse Ihre Hand, Madame (<b>I</b> <b>Kiss</b> Your Hand, Madame). Dialogueless, it contains only a few songs performed by Richard Tauber. The movie was made with the sound-on-film system controlled by the German-Dutch firm Tobis, corporate heirs to the Tri-Ergon concern. With an eye toward commanding the emerging European market for sound film, Tobis entered into a compact with its chief competitor, Klangfilm, a joint subsidiary of Germany's two leading electrical manufacturers. Early in 1929, Tobis and Klangfilm began comarketing their recording and playback technologies. As ERPI began to wire theaters around Europe, Tobis-Klangfilm claimed that the Western Electric system infringed on the Tri-Ergon patents, stalling the introduction of American technology in many places. Just as RCA had entered the movie business to maximize its recording system's value, Tobis also established its own production operations.|$|E

500|$|Media {{portrayals of}} Naomi Watts' and Laura Elena Harring's views of their onscreen {{relationships}} were varied and conflicting. Watts {{said of the}} filming of the scene, [...] "I don't see it as erotic, though maybe it plays that way. The last time I saw it, I actually had {{tears in my eyes}} because I knew where the story was going. It broke my heart a little bit." [...] However, in another interview Watts stated, [...] "I was amazed how honest and real all this looks on screen. These girls look really in love and it was curiously erotic." [...] While Harring was quoted saying, [...] "The love scene just happened in my eyes. Rita's very grateful for the help Betty's given [...] so I'm saying goodbye and goodnight to her, thank you, {{from the bottom of my}} heart, <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> her and then there's just an energy that takes us [...] Of course I have amnesia so I don't know if I've done it before, but I don't think we're really lesbians." [...] Heather Love agreed somewhat with Harring's perception when she stated that identity in Mulholland Drive is not as important as desire: [...] "who we are does not count for much—what matters instead is what we are about to do, what we want to do." ...|$|E
500|$|In many Buffy episodes, {{understanding}} why evil has appeared {{is important in}} knowing how to fight it, but the reasons for The Gentlemen's arrival and their need to take seven human hearts are never made explicit; they are simply there. According to Giles' overhead transparencies, they can appear in any town. Several Buffy scholars assert that a sexual element similar to what is presented in classic fairy tales is evident in [...] "Hush". Buffy often has prophetic dreams, {{and it is in}} a dream that she first sees one of The Gentlemen; she sees a flash of his face just as Riley touches her shoulder. Buffy has only been sexually intimate twice before: with the vampire Angel, whose lovemaking cost him his soul, and with the womanizing Parker Abrams. Riley is notably different from both and Buffy's anxiety about becoming intimate with him, according to scholars, either calls The Gentlemen to Sunnydale or is represented by them. The Gentlemen murder by cutting chests open and removing hearts, penetrative acts. In Buffy's dream Riley says, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> you, it'll make the sun go down" [...] and when he does so, it instantly becomes night, as if Buffy has crossed over a threshold. Riley's kiss creates physical and emotional intimacy, but initiates mental, intuitive knowledge as well: in this episode Buffy learns of Riley's secret role as a member of The Initiative. Threshold imagery is again used when Tara and Willow block the door with their combined efforts, shutting The Gentlemen out.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004 she {{appeared}} in the film Birth, which received controversy over {{a scene in which}} Kidman shares a bath with her co-star, 10-year-old Cameron Bright. At a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, Kidman addressed the controversy saying, [...] "It wasn't that I wanted to make a film where <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> a 10-year-old boy. I wanted to make a film where you understand love". Kidman earned her seventh Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actress– Motion Picture Drama. That same year {{she appeared}} in the black comedy-science-fiction film The Stepford Wives, a remake of the 1975 film of the same name. Kidman appeared in the lead role as Joanna Eberhart, a successful producer. The film, directed by Frank Oz, was critically panned and a commercial failure. The following year, Kidman appeared opposite Sean Penn in the Sydney Pollack thriller The Interpreter, playing UN translator Silvia Broome. Also that year, she starred in Bewitched, based on the 1960s TV sitcom of the same name, opposite Will Ferrell. Both Kidman and Ferrell earned that year's Razzie Award for [...] "Worst Screen Couple". Neither film fared well in the United States, with box office sales falling well short of the production costs, but both films performed well internationally.|$|E
2500|$|Spector {{commissioned}} Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil {{to write}} a song for the group, bringing them over from New York to Los Angeles {{to stay at the}} Chateau Marmont Hotel so they could write the song. Taking a cue from [...] "Baby I Need Your Loving" [...] by The Four Tops that was then rising in the charts, Mann and Weil decided {{to write a}} ballad. Mann wrote the melody first, and came up with the opening line [...] "You never close your eyes anymore when <b>I</b> <b>kiss</b> your lips", influenced by a line from the song [...] "I Love How You Love Me" [...] that was co-written by Mann - [...] "I love how your eyes close whenever you kiss me". Mann and Weil wrote the first two verses quickly, including the chorus line [...] "you've lost that lovin' feelin'", and Spector added [...] "gone, gone, gone, whoa, whoa, whoa" [...] {{to the end of the}} chorus, which Weil disliked. [...] The line [...] "you've lost that lovin' feelin'" [...] was originally only intended to be a dummy line that would be replaced later, but Spector liked it and decided to keep it. The form of the song is of verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus or ABABCB form. [...] Mann and Weil had problems writing the bridge and the ending, and asked Spector for help. Spector experimented on the piano with a [...] "Hang On Sloopy" [...] riff that they would then use to build on for the bridge.|$|E
