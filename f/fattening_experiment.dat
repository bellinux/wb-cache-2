Totally 90 broiler duck were divided to three groups. Experimental group 1 (n= 30) received probiotic strain Lactobacillus fermentum CCM 7158 with concentration of 1 x 109 colony forming units (CFU) in drinking water daily addition of 0. 90 g day 1 to day 56 of fattening. Experimental group 2 (n= 30) received probiotic strain Enterococcus faecium M 74 with concentration of 1 x 109 colony forming units (CFU) in drinking water daily addition of 0. 45 g day 1 to day 56 of fattening. The control group of birds (n= 30) received water without any probiotics. The supplementation of probiotic strains Lactobacillus fermentum and Enterococcus faecium no significant affected (P≥ 0. 05) final body weight, feed consumption and mortality of broiler ducks.

40|$|The work {{describes}} {{the effects of}} cimetidine on stress-induced gizzard erosions (Experiment A) {{and the influence of}} the long-term application (42 days) of the same drug on weight gain and feed consumption during broiler <b>fattening</b> (<b>Experiment</b> B). For Experiment A, 60 male, three-day-old chicks were divided into two groups: C (n = 30) - control chicks treated with 0. 5 ml saline; CIM (n = 30) - chicks treated with cimetidine in a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight (b. w.) in-tragastrically. All chicks were stressed using a modified water-immersion stress method according to which the chicks, after 24 h of feed deprivation, were immersed in tap water (17 °C) for a few seconds. Under chloroform anaesthesia ten chicks from each group were killed 1, 2 and 3 h after the stressing. The morphometric analysis of gizzard erosion (GE) and histopathological examinations of gizzards were performed for each chick. In Experiment B, 32 one-day-old broilers of both sexes were used. The control group was untreated (n = 16) while the CIM group (n = 16) was fed the same diet supplemented with 10 mg of cimetidine per kilogram of feed throughout the fattening period (42 days). The results of Experiment A showed decreased mean length of the GE in the cimetidine-treated birds as compared with the GE lesions of the controls. In Experiment B, the treated chicks had reduced liveweight (1835. 1 g), carcass weight (1474. 6 g) and increased feed consumption (2115 g of feed per kilogram of weight gain) compared to the controls in which the same parameters were 1898. 5 g, 1574. 2 g and 1797 g, respectively. The results show that while stress-induced GE of chicks can be medicated pharmacologically, long-term application of the same substance impairs the results of fattening. ...|$|E

Objective {{of the study}} was to establish the optimal level of non-degradable protein in diets for weaned and intensively <b>fattened</b> lambs. <b>Experiment</b> was conducted on 60 lambs of F 1 generation: Pirot Pramenka x Wurttemberg x Ile de France, weaned at the age of 60 days and divided into three groups. The effect of use of three concentrated mixtures which differed in the share of protein non-degradable at the level of rumen: 43 % (I), 51 % (II) and 58 % (III). Average daily gain of lambs fed types of mixtures I:II:III was 0. 169 : 0. 205 : 0. 227 kg, respectively. Dry matter conversion (kg/kg of gain) on analogue treatments was: 4. 54 : 3. 71 : 3. 30, respectively, of energy (MJ NEM/kg) : 33. 77 : 29. 37 : 26. 25, and of total proteins (g/kg) : 732 : 596 : 549. Level of intake of proteins was not influenced by the treatment considering that the digestibility coefficients recorded were: 52. 58 % : 51. 30 % : 55. 12 %. With the increase of the share of non-degradable protein in concentrate mixtures, the tendency of increase of the digestibility of fat was present: 76. 13 : 77. 98 : 87. 17 %, as well as of decrease of the intake of fibre: 67. 40 : 45. 87 : 22. 39 % and NFE: 83. 87 : 76. 05 : 82. 96 %.

The <b>experiment,</b> which lasted 90 days, involved 48 fattening steers (264 ± 37. 4 kg BW) randomly allocated to three diets. Treatments included: a control diet containing rice straw and molasses (T 1); diet containing bagasse–vinasse mixture including sweet corn husk and cob silage (BS; T 2); and diet containing bagasse–vinasse mixture including pineapple peel silage (BP; T 3). All treatments included a commercial concentrate feed (13 % CP) and ad libitum rice straw throughout the experiment. Results from chemical analysis showed that dry matter (DM) of BS was higher than BP (P 0. 05). For fermentation characteristics, pH in BP was lower than BS (P< 0. 05); in addition, acetic and butyric acids in BS were higher than BP (P< 0. 05).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{behaviour}} and the production and slaughter traits of growing rabbits reared in different alternative rearing systems and in conventional <b>fattening</b> cages. The <b>experiment</b> was carried out with 312 Pannon White growing rabbits between 5 and 11 weeks of age. According to the pen size, floor type and stocking density 8 experimental groups were created. For analyzing the different behavioural patterns 24 h video recordings were performed weekly by using infrared cameras. The body weight and the feed consumption of the rabbits were also measured weekly. At 11 weeks of age all of the animals were slaughtered and dissected. For the comparison of the behaviour and production of the experimental and control animals the Dunnett-test was used. It was established that the different alternative rearing methods have a significant effect only on the social and stereotype behaviour of the rabbits. The daily weight gain was highest in the control animals, while lowest in the rabbits reared on deep litter. The feed consumption, the feed conversion ratio and the slaughter characteristics were not affected by the rearing method. It was concluded that from the ethological point of view housing rabbits in pens – particularly on deep litter – has a favourable effect on both of the social and stereotype behaviours’ frequency. However, when rabbits are reared on deep litter, some consumption of the litter material should be calculated, but it does not decrease the pellet consumption and the final liveweight of the animals significantly...|$|R

A total of 300 clinically healthy female turkeys (broad-breasted white turkey, hybrid XL) were used in the experiment. Female turkeys were randomly divided into two groups (150 pcs per each).

Doubts were however raised whether these feeding regimes can maintain good growth performance and carcass quality of pigs. Three experiments were carried out to study different organic feeding regimes in weaned piglets and <b>fattening</b> pigs. In <b>Experiment</b> 1, we evaluated the use of peas and faba beans (0, 120, or 240 g kg- 1) in diets for weaned piglets. Piglets fed pea diets performed {{as well as those}} fed the control diet, whereas the highest faba bean level resulted in reduced feed intake and growth performance. In Experiment 2, we studied the replacement (0, 33, or 67 %) of rapeseed cake with blue lupins in fattening pig diets. The dietary lupin level had a quadratic effect on the weight gain of growing pigs, the best performance being observed at the 33 % replacement level. However, dietary lupin level did not influence weight gain during the finishing period and total fattening. Back fat became softer with increasing dietary lupin levels. In Experiment 3, different protein supplements were compared in organic diets from weaning to slaughter. In two-phase feeding, the best performance was observed when whey protein was used as the protein supplement, followed by soya bean cake + whey protein and rapeseed cake + fish meal. The effects of a one-phase organic feeding regime with cold-pressed rapeseed cake + whey protein did not differ from those of the two-phase organic feeding regimes. Fattening pigs fed organic diets required from two to seven days longer to reach slaughter weight than those fed conventional diets. Pigs fed organic diets had fatter carcasses, but the eating quality of organic pork did not differ from that of pork from pigs fed conventional diets. Feed costs and the circulation rate of pigs, weaners in particular, were greater and carcass prices lower in the organic feeding regimes than in the conventional ones. ...|$|R
