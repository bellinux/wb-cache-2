40|$|Abstract. The {{measurement}} {{of the volume of}} information is fraught with difficulties. However, trends in availability and usage can be very revealing, as is shown by some examples. This paper argues that considerations of the volume of information should not be divorced from those of the value of information. In communications, informative comparisons appear to be possible by classifying technologies in just a few dimensions, associated with the features of cost, speed, availability, and usability. An argument is also made that as a rough approximation, the value of information in terms of its volume is best thought of on a logarithmic scale. This approach provides a rough quantitative guide to the diminishing marginal utility delivered by the rapid progress in computing, storage, and communication technologies. It offers a partial explanation for slow uptake of ultra-high speed broadband and related phenomena. This paper will appear in a special section of the International Journal of Communication: “How to measure how much <b>information</b> is <b>out</b> <b>there?</b> Methodological and statistical challenges for the social sciences. ...|$|R

40|$|Time-triggered and event-triggered control {{strategies}} for stabilization of an unstable plant over a rate-limited communication channel subject to unknown, bounded delay are studied and compared. Event triggering carries implicit information, revealing {{the state of}} the plant. However, the delay in the communication channel causes information loss, as it makes the state <b>information</b> <b>out</b> of date. <b>There</b> is a critical delay value, when the loss of information due to the communication delay perfectly compensates the implicit information carried by the triggering events. This occurs when the maximum delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the plant.

40|$|Ireland’s waters {{constitute}} one of {{the richest}} habitats for cetaceans in Europe. Marine mammals, particularly cetaceans, are known to be definitive hosts of digestive parasites from the Fm. Anisakidae. The main aim {{of this study is to}} collect and compile all the <b>information</b> available <b>out</b> <b>there</b> regarding parasites of the Fm. Anisakidae and their definitive hosts. Secondary objectives are to relate the presence of cetacean species with the presence of parasites of the Fm. Anisakidae and to determine whether this greater number of cetaceans relates to a greater level of parasitism. Prevalence and burdens of anisakids in definitive hosts vary widely with host species, geographic location, and season. Results from several post-mortem exams are given. However, they cannot be compared due to differences in collecting techniques. Anisakis simplex is the most commonly and widespread parasite found in the majority of the samples and in a major number of hosts, which include harbour porpoise, short-beaked common dolphin and bottlenose dolphin. Studies on harbour porpoise obtained prevalences of Anisakis spp. of 46 % (n= 26) and of 100 % (n= 12). Another study in common dolphin reported a prevalence of 68 % (n= 25). Several reasons could influence the variations in the presence of Anisakis.
