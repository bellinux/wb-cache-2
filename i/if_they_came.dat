In 1940, he also wrote a poem praising Hitler.|$|E

By 1976, prosecutors had convicted 18 American corporations of contributing illegally to Nixon's campaign.|$|E

Curtin realised that Australia would be ignored unless it had a strong voice in Washington, D.C., and he wanted that voice to be MacArthur's. He gave over control of Australian forces to MacArthur, directing Australian commanders to treat MacArthur's orders as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> from the Australian Government.|$|E

Horses and mules were important methods of transportation that could be endangered <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> into close contact with gas. This was not so much of a problem until it became common to launch gas great distances. This caused many researchers to develop masks that could be used on animals such as dogs, horses, mules, and even carrier pigeons.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{the purpose}} of the {{colonization}} policy was unrelated to the ethnic makeup, being to increase the population of the rather sparsely populated area, in order to better exploit its resources. It was part of the larger campaign of colonization of Novorossiya, under which Russia appealed to everyone who wanted to work and live under its authority, no matter <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> from the Russian Empire or from elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Due to his {{advanced}} age, Augustus {{was unable}} {{to travel to the}} east himself. There were few the Emperor trusted to settle matters in the east, but he was confident Gaius could. Gaius made a good choice, because his presence represented that of the imperial family - all orders, promises, or threats coming from him were as valid as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> from the Emperor himself. Nonetheless, he was only eighteen, and therefore too young for the conduct of important business.|$|E

25|$|According to Aftenposten, the Norwegian Army base at Meymaneh was {{amongst the}} least secure bases in Afghanistan at one point. Meymaneh {{is located in}} northwestern Afghanistan, which has become {{increasingly}} restless in recent years. Both the military and political heads {{of the armed forces}} agreed about the weakened state of the base. When the Norwegian Army was asked what they needed to defend their position, they asked for 120 troops and long-range weapons. They also requested a mobile reaction force, so that allies in the region could assist each other <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> under heavy attack.|$|E
25|$|Tarsila do Amaral rata {{was born}} in Capivari, {{a small town in}} the {{countryside}} of the state of São Paulo. She was born to a wealthy family of farmers and landowners who grew coffee. At that time in Brazil, women were not encouraged to seek higher education, especially <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> from rich families and had everything they needed; despite coming from a well-to-do family, Tarsila had her family's support in obtaining higher education. As a teenager, Tarsila and her parents traveled to Spain, where Tarsila caught people's eyes by drawing and painting copies of the artwork she saw at her school's archives.|$|E

Humphreys, to support Sheridan {{on his right}} flank, {{to the east of}} his objectives. Grant wanted these {{infantry}} corps to outflank the Confederates in their defenses and prevent them from interfering with Sheridan's mission, pushing them back to their lines <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> out to fight. Warren's corps initially also was ordered to seize Dinwiddie Court House, Virginia, which also would capture a portion of the Boydton Plank Road at that location, but later that task was given to Sheridan.|$|E

25|$|Chamberlain's {{policy of}} {{appeasement}} emerged from {{the failure of the}} League of Nations and the failure of collective security. The League of Nations was set up in the aftermath of World War I in the hope that international cooperation and collective resistance to aggression might prevent another war. Members of the League were entitled to the assistance of other members <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> under attack. The policy of collective security ran in parallel with measures to achieve international disarmament and where possible was to be based on economic sanctions against an aggressor. It appeared to be ineffectual when confronted by the aggression of dictators, notably Germany's Remilitarization of the Rhineland, and Italian leader Benito Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War little thought had been given to the most {{efficient}} formations to use for military aircraft. Groups of fliers (drawn from the various nations Army or Navy) would fly in columns, or line ahead, as if they were troops of cavalry or flotillas of ships. This was soon found to be inefficient, for several reasons. First, the leaders were unable to communicate with their squadrons, and they with him, other than the vague instruction to follow the leader. Second, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> under anti-aircraft fire from the ground, the flight would either all turn at once, scattering the formation, or they would follow the leader round a point, as horsemen or ships, maintaining cohesion but being exposed to fire on a fixed point.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} archaeological discussion {{as to the}} route taken by the first colonisers. People appear to have arrived by sea {{during a period of}} glaciation, when New Guinea and Tasmania were joined to the continent. The journey still required sea travel however, making them amongst the world's earlier mariners. Scott Cane wrote in 2013 that the first wave may have been prompted by the eruption of Mount Toba and if they arrived around 70,000 years ago could have crossed the water from Timor, when the sea level was low – but <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> later, around 50,000 years ago, a more likely route would be through the Moluccas to New Guinea. Given that the likely landfall regions have been under around 50 metres of water for the last 15,000 years, {{it is unlikely that the}} timing will ever be established with certainty.|$|E

25|$|Early European {{settlers}} in America brought a strong wrestling tradition with them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> from England. The settlers also found wrestling {{to be popular}} among Native Americans. Amateur wrestling flourished throughout {{the early years of}} the North American colonies and served as a popular activity at country fairs, holiday celebrations, and in military exercises. The first organized national wrestling tournament took place in New York City in 1888, and wrestling has been an event at every modern Olympic Games since the 1904 games in St. Louis, Missouri (a demonstration had been performed at the first modern Olympics). The international governing body for the sport, United World Wrestling (UWW), was established in 1912 in Antwerp, Belgium as the International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles (FILA). The 1st NCAA Wrestling Championships were also held in 1912, in Ames, Iowa. USA Wrestling, located in Colorado Springs, Colorado, became the national governing body of amateur wrestling in 1983. It conducts competitions for all age-levels.|$|E
25|$|On {{the first}} day Tryon feinted, pretending to send out two torpedo boats and a battleship, causing Markham to scurry to intercept. For {{the next two days}} he did nothing, except fire {{occasional}} shots at Markham's ships from shore batteries <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> too close. On the fourth evening he sent out two torpedo boats showing no lights with the intention of starting more false alarms. The boats did well, returning with four enemy torpedo boats which they had surprised and captured. By 3 August the enemy had been at sea for nine days and aside from the tedium of their wait would now be low on coal. Tryon ordered all ships to be ready to sail at 9.30pm on 3 August and for all the upper parts of the ships to be painted black. The fastest ships, Warspite, Iris, Severn, Volage, Cossack and three torpedo boats left via the western entrance, staying as close to the shore as they dared, heading for the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Tryon took the remaining larger ships through the eastern entrance, giving the appearance of an attempt to break through the blockading ships. Within an hour the Hercules was spotted and great excitement broke out amongst the blockaders. Tryon immediately turned around and headed back to port. Just as they returned to anchor, flares at sea showed that, too late, one blockader had spotted Tryon's escaping ships.|$|E
25|$|As of March 2001, 2,265 {{victims have}} been officially {{certified}} (1,784 {{of whom have}} died) and over 10,000 people have received financial compensation from Chisso, although they are not recognised as official victims. The issue of quantifying the impact of Minamata disease is complicated, as a full epidemiological study has never been conducted and patients were recognised only if they voluntarily applied to a certification council to seek financial compensation. Many victims of Minamata disease faced discrimination and ostracism from the local community <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>came</b> {{out into the open}} about their symptoms. Some people feared the disease to be contagious, and many local people were fiercely loyal to Chisso, depending on the company for their livelihoods. In this atmosphere, sufferers were reluctant to come forward and seek certification. Despite these factors, over 17,000 people have applied to the council for certification. Also, in recognising an applicant as a Minamata disease sufferer, the certification council qualified that patient to receive financial compensation from Chisso. For that reason, the council has always been under immense pressure to reject claimants and minimise the financial burden placed on Chisso. Rather than being a council of medical recognition, the decisions of the council were always affected by the economic and political factors surrounding Minamata and the Chisso corporation. Furthermore, compensation of the victims led to continued strife in the community, including unfounded accusations that {{some of the people who}} sought compensation did not actually suffer from the disease. More properly, the impact should be called a criminal 'poisoning', not a clinical 'disease'. These forms of obfuscation are commonly experienced by 'environmental victims' in many countries.|$|E
