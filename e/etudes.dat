5|$|When he {{developed}} his scheme for organizing {{all of his}} novels and stories into a single sequence called La Comédie humaine, Balzac placed La Peau de chagrin {{at the start of}} the section called <b>Études</b> philosophiques ("Philosophical Studies"). Like the other works in this category– including the similarly autobiographical Louis Lambert (1832)– it deals with philosophy and the supernatural. But it also provides a bridge to the realism of the <b>Études</b> des mœurs ("Study of Manners"), where the majority of his novels were located.|$|E
5|$|Although critics panned the novel, Balzac {{remained}} steadfast in {{his belief}} that it provided an important look at philosophy, especially metaphysics. As he developed the scheme for La Comédie humaine, he placed Louis Lambert in the <b>Études</b> philosophiques section, and later returned to the same themes in his novel Séraphîta, about an androgynous angelic creature.|$|E

5|$|Louis Lambert is an 1832 {{novel by}} French novelist and playwright Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850), {{included}} in the <b>Études</b> philosophiques section of his novel sequence La Comédie humaine.

5|$|There {{are several}} {{academic}} libraries and archives in Paris. The Sorbonne Library in the 5th arrondissement {{is the largest}} university library in Paris. In addition to the Sorbonne location, there are branches in Malesherbes, Clignancourt-Championnet, Michelet-Institut d'Art et d'Archéologie, Serpente-Maison de la Recherche, and Institut des <b>Etudes</b> Ibériques.

5|$|Two of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli (1821–1897) and Georges Mathias, were {{themselves}} piano teachers and passed on {{details of his}} playing to their own students, some of whom (such as Raoul Koczalski) were to make recordings of his music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin's style include Louis Moreau Gottschalk, Édouard Wolff (1816–1880) and Pierre Zimmermann. Debussy dedicated his own 1915 piano <b>Études</b> {{to the memory of}} Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the Paris Conservatoire, and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the publisher Jacques Durand.|$|E

5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work <b>Etudes</b> sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|All of Chopin's {{compositions}} {{include the}} piano. Most are for solo piano, though {{he also wrote}} two piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented {{the concept of the}} instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, <b>études,</b> impromptus, scherzos, preludes and sonatas, some published only after his death. Influences on his composition style include Polish folk music, the classical tradition of J. S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert, as well as the Paris salons where he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after the late Romantic period.|$|E
5|$|Copeland was a {{standout}} among her peers. In her {{first season as}} a soloist at New York City Center, in which avant-garde ballets works were performed, she received good notices in The New York Times for a Balanchine Ballo della Regina role.

Her performances of Tharp's works in the same season were recognized, and she was described as more sophisticated and contemporary as a soloist than she had been as a corps dancer. Her summer 2008 Metropolitan Opera House (the Met) season performances in Don Quixote and Sleeping Beauty were also well received.|$|E

He also made several interesting arrangements by composers such as Handel and Mozart. He arranged a string orchestra {{version of the}} Symphony for Solo Piano, Op. 39 Nos. 4–7 by Charles-Valentin Alkan, a composer still largely unknown at that time, the original {{of which has been}} said to surpass even the Transcendental <b>Études</b> of Franz Liszt in scale and difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The Dogon {{people are}} {{an ethnic group}} in Mali, West Africa, {{reported}} by some researchers to have traditional astronomical knowledge about Sirius that would normally be considered impossible {{without the use of}} telescopes. In 1938 Marcel Griaule produced his dissertation and received his doctorate degree from the École pratique des hautes <b>études</b> (EPHE) based on his research work with the Dogon. According to Griaule's books Conversations with Ogotemmêli 1965 and The Pale Fox 1972 they knew about the fifty-year orbital period of Sirius and its companion prior to western astronomers. They also refer to a third star accompanying Sirius A and B. Robert Temple's 1976 book The Sirius Mystery, credits them with knowledge of the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn. This {{has been the subject of}} controversy and speculation.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu {{was also}} {{introduced}} to Frederica, Duchess of Cumberland, and became relatively {{close to her}} son George of Cumberland and Teviotdale, the future ruler of Hanover. Initially hosted by a community of the Huguenot diaspora, he later became the guest of a Calvinist pastor named Jonas, in whose residence he witnessed gatherings of activists in favor of German unification (see Burschenschaft). According to his own recollections, his group of Moldavians was kept under close watch by Alexandru Sturdza, who, in addition, enlisted Kogălniceanu's help in writing his work <b>Études</b> historiques, chrétiennes et morales ("Historical, Christian and Moral Studies"). During summer trips to the Pomeranian town of Heringsdorf, he met the novelist Willibald Alexis, whom he befriended, and who, as Kogălniceanu recalled, lectured him on the land reform carried out by Prussian King Frederick William III. Later, Kogălniceanu studied the effects of reform when on visit to Alt Schwerin, and saw the possibility for replicating its results in his native country.|$|E
