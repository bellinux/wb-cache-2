40|$|A highly {{enantioselective}} copper/N-heterocyclic carbene catalyzed allylic arylation with organolithium compounds is presented. The use {{of commercial}} or readily prepared aryllithium reagents in the reaction with allyl bromides affords {{a variety of}} chiral diarylvinylmethanes, comprising a privileged structural motif in pharmaceuticals, in high yields with good to excellent regio- and enantioselectivities. The versatility of this new transformation is illustrated in the formal synthesis of the marketed drug tolterodine (<b>Detrol)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|A {{tertiary}} stereogenic {{center that}} bears two different aryl substituents {{is found in}} a variety of bioactive compounds, including medicines such as Zoloft and <b>Detrol.</b> We have developed an efficient method for the synthesis of enantioenriched 1, 1 -diarylalkanes from readily available racemic benzylic alcohols. Formation of a benzylic mesylate (which is not isolated), followed by treatment with an arylzinc reagent, LiI, and a chiral nickel/bis(oxazoline) catalyst, furnishes the Negishi cross-coupling product in high ee and good yield. A wide array of functional groups (e. g., an aryl iodide, a thiophene, and an N-Boc-indole) are compatible with the mild reaction conditions. This method has been applied to a gram-scale synthesis of a precursor to Zoloft. ...|$|E
40|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} {{is estimated}} to affect up to 30 % {{of women in the}} USA, although differences in the populations studied and the definition of urinary incontinence have contributed to wide variations in estimates of its prevalence. The number of women with overactive bladder (characterised by symptoms of urinary frequency and urgency with or without urge incontinence) is likely to be even higher. Although bladder symptoms are relatively common and have a significant negative impact on their quality of life, many women fail to seek treatment, believing that their symptoms are a consequence of aging or childbirth. Instead, they may adopt complex coping strategies, {{such as the use of}} protective pads. Behavioral techniques, such as Kegel exercises and bladder training are useful first-line treatments for stress and urge incontinence, respectively. In addition, women with urge incontinence as well as symptoms of frequency and urgency may also be treated successfully with an antimuscarinic agent, such as tolterodine (<b>Detrol</b> LA®/Detrusitol SR®). Public education programs to raise awareness about urinary incontinence and its treatment aim to improve communication between physician and patient to ensure that bladder symptoms are recognised and treated appropriately...|$|E
40|$|In Chapter 2, {{we report}} a highly {{enantioselective}} synthesis of β-alkyl-substituted alcohols through a one-pot Cu- catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation with organolithium reagents followed by reductive ozonolysis. The synthesis of γ-alkyl-substituted alcohols was also achieved through Cu-catalyzed asymmetric allylic alkylation with organolithium reagents {{followed by a}} hydroboration-oxidation. These protocols do not compromise the stereochemical integrity and provide readily access to highly valuable chiral building blocks. In Chapter 3, a highly enantioselective Cu-catalyzed direct allylic arylation using organolithium compounds is described. The use of readily available aryllithium reagents in combination with allylic bromides and use of a copper-NHC catalyst are key factors {{for the success of}} this reaction. The only stoichiometric waste produced in this novel transformation is LiBr. The use of n-BuLi was found essential for the preparation of aryllithium compounds. The broad substrate and reagent scope and the application of the new method in the formal catalytic enantioselective synthesis of (R) -tolterodine (<b>Detrol)</b> illustrate the potential of this allylic arylation for the synthesis of important chiral diarylmethane structures. In Chapter 4, we report a highly enantioselective synthesis of quaternary all- carbon stereocenters via Cu-catalyzed direct allylic arylation using organolithium compounds. A Cu(I) -NHC catalytic system proved to be essential for this transformation and allowed the preparation {{of a wide range of}} di- and tri-arylated vinyl methane compounds with good to excellent enantioselectivites. This transformation is also highly atom economical as LiBr is the only stoichiometric waste during this transformation...|$|E

This research sought to understand whether or not direct-to-consumer prescription drug ads (DTC ads) made people think about their own death (referred to as mortality salience) and what effects these thoughts had on people's opinions of brands of varying status. Study 1 used a free-writing questionnaire to collect brands. Study 2 used scales to rate participant attitude toward 12 DTC ads. Study 2 showed the the ads for Cymbalta and Plavix made people the most anxious; the ads for <b>Detrol</b> LA and Crestor made people the least anxious. Study 3 used word completions to measure for mortality salience. Study 3 also provided additional brand ratings. Study 4 used a lexical decision task to measure for mortality salience; results showed that participants who watched the ads for Cymbalta and Plavix responded faster to death words. The status of brand had no effect on how participants rated the brand. Additional signal detection analysis showed participants to be less sensitive to death words after watching the Cymbalta and Plavix ads. Participant criterion bias did not vary across word type or between condition...|$|E
40|$|Overactive bladder (OAB), {{a common}} {{condition}} affecting ~= 16 - 17 % of adult {{men and women}} in Europe and the US, is characterized by symptoms of urinary urgency, with or without urge urinary incontinence (UUI), usually with micturition frequency and nocturia. OAB is thought to result from abnormal, involuntary detrusor contractions during bladder filling. The symptoms of OAB have a considerable adverse effect on quality of life (QOL) in affected patients, and are associated with an increased risk of comorbidities, and increased direct and indirect costs. Management of OAB focuses on symptom improvement, and includes nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy. Extended-release tolterodine (Detrusitol(R) XL, <b>Detrol</b> LA(R), Detrusitol SR(R), Detrusitol(R) Neo, Detrusitol(R) Retard, Unidet(TM)) is an oral, once-daily, nonselective, competitive antimuscarinic drug. It acts on smooth muscle motor efferent pathways, including bladder detrusor muscle, and is a first-line therapy for OAB. Extended-release tolterodine is at least as effective as immediate-release tolterodine in improving UUI and other symptoms associated with OAB (including urinary frequency, urgency symptoms, voided volume/micturition), and in improving health-related QOL. It has similar efficacy to oral immediate- or extended-release oxybutynin, or transdermal oxybutynin. The likelihood of dry mouth, the most bothersome anticholinergic adverse effect associated with antimuscarinic drugs, is significantly reduced with extended-release tolterodine in patients with OAB compared with immediate-release tolterodine. Dry mouth also occurs significantly less frequently with extended-release tolterodine than with immediate- or extended-release oxybutynin. The incidence of dry mouth with extended-release tolterodine or transdermal oxybutynin is similar. In economic models, extended-release tolterodine is more cost effective in patients with OAB than no treatment, or treatment with immediate-release tolterodine or immediate-release oxybutynin, and is as cost effective as extended-release oxybutynin. In conclusion, clinical and economic data support the use of extended-release tolterodine as a first-line therapy in the management of adult patients with OAB. It is at least as effective as immediate-release tolterodine, but is associated with a lower incidence of dry mouth. Moreover, the convenient once-daily administration regimen offers the potential for good compliance. The favorable efficacy and tolerability profile of extended-release tolterodine has been demonstrated for up to 12 months. Extended-release tolterodine is as effective as oral immediate- or extended-release oxybutynin, but is better tolerated in terms of dry mouth. It has similar efficacy and tolerability (including dry mouth) to transdermal oxybutynin. Extended-release tolterodine is, therefore, a valuable first-line therapy in the treatment of OAB.
