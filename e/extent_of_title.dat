Carried out by the California Coalition for Sex Equity in Education, the {{study was designed to}} demonstrate that districts which make an active effort to promote Title IX implementation by involving public administrators, board members, teachers, specialists, students, and community aembers will achieve high levels of sex equity awareness, skills, and knowledge of programs. A corollary purpose was to identify types of training and technical assistance most useful for achieving sex equity in education. A pre-asSessment of the selected schools revealed that some schools achieved less than minimum compliance to Title IX. Trained interviewers then questioned school district teams on access to courses, nonacademic programs, physical education, athletics, an...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess cost of land title {{formalisation}} in Ghana from the standpoint of individual land/property owners with the view to suggesting a cost-effective means for title formalisation in the country. Design/methodology/approach The paper adopts a quantitative research approach with mainly questionnaire instruments to obtain data from real estate valuers, land agents and lawyers in Accra, Ghana's capital city. Findings Consistent with the literature, the paper found that title formalisation cost is high with extensive time lag. A substantial portion of the cost emanates from commuting cost for follow-ups to expedite action on title formalisation activities, cost of time lag and unofficial and professional fees for facilitation of title formalisation activities. Practical implications For land title formalisation to contribute to socio-economic development of Ghana and other developing countries, there is a need for effective and efficient land title formalisation regime to reduce excessive time lag and monetary cost for title formalisation. Originality/value Few studies have examined the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>title</b> formalisation cost in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of these studies tend to overlook several indirect costs and give misleading cost reportage or focus on social cost. The study analyses land title formalisation cost from individual land/property owners’ standpoint. The paper incorporates indirect costs and gives an idea as to the cost trend. Being first of its kind, the study presents a new dimension to the assessment of land title formalisation cost in Ghana for policy formulation and practice...|$|E

40|$|This two-part article {{examines}} the juridical nature of radical title: does it confer full and unfettered beneficial title except to the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> native <b>title,</b> {{or is it a}} bare legal title? Part 1 explained that, contrary to the received view. the leading Privy Council and American authority in this context supported the latter interpretation. In Part 2 it is shown, also contrary to the orthodox view, that not only is New Zealand authority directly relevant {{in the context of an}} inhabited settled colony such as Australia, but that such authority also supports the inchoate nature of the Crown's property rights upon acquisition of sovereignty It is also shown that, even before the High Court's fundamental restatement of the common law as it applies to Australia in Mabo, the High Court had described the nature <b>of</b> the <b>title</b> acquired by the Crown upon settlement as something less than a full proprietary estate underlying any pre-existing title. Nevertheless, the Mabo High Court attributed authority for the proposition that ownership of unalienated land which is not subject to native title must lie with the Crown since there is 'no other proprietor' to Stephen CJ in Attorney-General (NSW) v Brown. It is explained, however, that not only is this aspect of the decision in Attorney-General (NSW) v Brown incorrect in law, but more importantly, the Court's reason for rejecting defense counsel's argument - that the Crown did not have any property in the waste lands of the colony of New South Wales - can be distinguished post-Mabo...|$|R

40|$|Although cases {{decided in}} other colonial jurisdictions before Mabo and Others v State of Queensland (No 2) had {{recognised}} the Crown's 'radical title', {{the meaning of}} the term was not definitively explained. Consequently, it was possible for the majority judges in Mabo to attribute a meaning of something less than absolute beneficial ownership to the term, while the sole dissenting judge attributed a meaning of nothing less than absolute beneficial ownership to the term. Nevertheless, post-Mabo, it has generally been assumed that Crown's 'radical title' connotes a full and unfettered proprietary right except to the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> native <b>title,</b> This two-part article shows, however, that this assumption fails to appreciate the significance of the historical meaning of radical tit/e [...] It is argued that, as a legal concept, radical title is a bare legal title which does not automatically confer beneficial ownership of the land to which it relates. Part 1 explains that, contrary to the received view, the leading Privy Council authorities on the nature <b>of</b> the Crown's <b>title</b> to land which is subject to pre-existing title are not authority for the proposition that the Crown has a present proprietary estate underlying the pre-existing title, nor the proposition that the Crown's radical title is necessarily a full and present proprietary estate in respect of land not subject to pre-existing rights. It is also shown, by reference to American authority, that the reason for concluding that the Crown holds the unalienated and unoccupied lands of a settled colony in demesne is the confusion of international law and municipal law, sovereignty and property...|$|R
