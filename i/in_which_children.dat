The number of pupils eligible for free school meals is well above the national average. In the most recent OFSTED inspection, the nursery provision was praised for enabling children who enter the school with skills below that expected of similarly–aged children nationwide to achieve well through a stimulating and engaging curriculum and the nursery provision was good overall. The primary provision was praised for providing a safe and engaging learning environment <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>children</b> are able to progress to a level broadly comparable with children nationally and where pupils are extremely well behaved. In all inspection categories, the primary provision was judged good.|$|E
5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>children</b> learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the museum began to collect material documenting the conflict. In November 1939, during the so-called 'Phoney War', the museum appeared in the opening sequence of the GPO Film Unit production The First Days, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>children</b> are seen playing on some of the museum's German artillery pieces captured during the First World War. With the evacuation of British forces from Dunkirk in May/June 1940, however, the British Army's shortage of equipment saw eighteen of the museum's artillery pieces return to military service. The museum's trench clubs were used by the Home Guard, while other items such as sights and optical instruments were returned to the Ministry of Supply. The museum refused, however, to return some historic items such as a naval gun from HMS Lance (which had fired Britain's first shot of the First World War) or a gun served by Victoria Cross-winning boy seaman Jack Cornwell. The museum initially remained open but was closed {{for the duration of the}} war in September 1940 with the onset of the Blitz. On 31 January 1941 the museum was struck by a Luftwaffe bomb which fell on the naval gallery. A number of ship models were damaged by the blast and a Short Seaplane, which had flown at the Battle of Jutland, was destroyed. While closed to the public the museum's building was used for a variety of purposes connected to the war effort, such as a repair garage for government motor vehicles, a centre for Air Raid Precautions civil defence lectures and a fire fighting training school. In October 1945 the museum mounted a temporary exhibition, the first since the end of the war in August, which showcased technologies developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department. These included the submarine fuel pipeline PLUTO, the fog dispersal method FIDO, and flame weapons such as the Churchill Crocodile and Wasp Universal Carrier. However, due to bomb damage to both the building and exhibits, the museum was obliged to reopen its galleries piecemeal. The museum reopened a portion of its galleries in November 1946. A third of the galleries were opened in 1948 and a further wing opened in 1949.|$|E

25|$|Early use of augmentative and {{alternative}} communication systems may assist {{the child in}} developing spoken language skills. Overall language delay is associated with problems of intellectual disability, deafness, and learned helplessness. Children with cerebral palsy {{are at risk of}} learned helplessness and becoming passive communicators, initiating little communication.

25|$|Piaget {{proposed}} a developmental theory of moral reasoning <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>children</b> progress from a naïve understanding of morality based on behavior and outcomes {{to a more}} advanced understanding based on intentions.

25|$|Language {{development}} {{is thought to}} proceed by ordinary processes of learning <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>children</b> acquire the forms, meanings, and uses of words and utterances from the linguistic input. The method in which we develop language skills is universal; however, the major debate is how the rules of syntax are acquired. There are two major approaches to syntactic development, an empiricist account by which children learn all syntactic rules from the linguistic input, and a nativist approach by which some principles of syntax are innate and are transmitted through the human genome.|$|E

25|$|Child {{slavery is}} also {{considered}} a contemporary form of slavery, although its does come with debate {{as to what}} constitutes child slavery. However, child prostitution is widely considered a form of slavery <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>children,</b> mostly from South East Asia, South Asia, and Latin America, “are sold by their parents either because they are destitute, have too many mouths to feed, or are simply greedy”. On the other hand, in some cases of child prostitution, when parents give their children up to traffickers, they are deceived into believing that their child will earn good money, get an education, or learn a trade.|$|E
25|$|In {{the model}} Piaget {{developed}} in stage three, {{he argued that}} intelligence develops {{in a series of}} stages that are related to age and are progressive because one stage must be accomplished before the next can occur. For each stage of development the child forms a view of reality for that age period. At the next stage, the child must keep up with earlier level of mental abilities to reconstruct concepts. Piaget conceived intellectual development as an upward expanding spiral <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>children</b> must constantly reconstruct the ideas formed at earlier levels with new, higher order concepts acquired at the next level.|$|E

25|$|Traditions {{similar to}} the modern custom of trick-or-treating extend {{all the way back}} to {{classical}} antiquity, although it is extremely unlikely that any of them are directly related to the modern custom.

The high importance placed on self-determination in American culture may go against the traditional values of cultures <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>children</b> are expected to obey and respect the wishes of their parents in all facets of their lives.

25|$|While {{slavery was}} institutionally {{recognized}} by most societies, {{it has now}} been outlawed in all recognized countries, the last being Mauritania in 2007. Nevertheless, there are still more slaves today than at any previous point in history, with an estimated 45 million people being in slavery worldwide. The most common form of the slave trade is now commonly referred to as human trafficking. Chattel slavery is also still practiced by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In other areas, slavery (or unfree labour) continues through practices such as debt bondage, serfdom, domestic servants kept in captivity, certain adoptions <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>children</b> are forced to work as slaves, child soldiers, and forced marriage.|$|E

40|$|The present {{investigation}} attempted {{to test the}} learned helplessness hypothesis in elementary and junior high school children.

Furthermore, children in each group were divided into two parts under the condition that half of them were given ten anagrams (a condition) and half thirty anagrams (b condition). Just after pretreatment-anagram learning, each of them evaluated his own attainment on that learning and also estimated the possibility of performance in subsequent learning with the five-point-rating scale. Subsequent learning was consisted of thirty-two soluble anagrams and was identical for each group. The main results were as follows: (1) Group I gave marks higher rating on subsequent learning than group II. (2) Group III gave marks lower rating on subsequent learning than group II. (3) The performance of group III in subsequent anagram learning was found to be impaired following experience with insoluble problems. That is, learned helplessness was confirmed in children. (4) The developmental differences in learned helplessness were not clearly resulted. (5) There were no systematic differences between a and b conditions in subsequent learning. And we discussed about the learned helplessness hypothesis related to the learning set in school children...|$|R
