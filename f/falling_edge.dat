2500|$|All PCI bus {{signals are}} sampled on the rising {{edge of the}} clock.

2500|$|In a {{prefetch}} buffer architecture, when {{a memory}} access occurs to a row the buffer grabs {{a set of}} adjacent data words on the row and reads them out ("bursts" [...] them) in rapid-fire sequence on the IO pins, {{without the need for}} individual column address requests. This assumes the CPU wants adjacent datawords in memory, which in practice is very often the case. [...] For instance, in DDR1, two adjacent data words will be read from each chip in the same clock cycle and placed in the pre-fetch buffer. Each word will then be transmitted on consecutive rising and falling edges of the clock cycle. Similarly, in DDR2 with a 4n pre-fetch buffer, four consecutive data words are read and placed in buffer while a clock, which is twice faster than the external clock of DDR, transmits each of the word in consecutive rising and <b>falling</b> <b>edge</b> of the faster external clock ...|$|E

The total PSIJ transfer function of an inverter chain output is then estimated by alternately accumulating the local PSIJ transfer function at local rising and <b>falling</b> <b>edges.</b> Based on several assumptions, the full PSIJ transfer function model is significantly simplified, which provides physical insights of PSIJ at inverter chains.

40|$|Fertilizer {{spreaders}} {{are traditionally}} tested {{by using the}} collecting tray method. This method requires large indoor test facilities and is very expensive when applied on a large scale. A proposed alternative method is to measure the velocity and diameter of individual fertilizer particles emanating from the spreader and use a model to predict the landing spot of individual particles. The total spread pattern follows from accumulating {{a large number of}} particle landing spots. An optical device for measuring the velocity vector and dimensions of individual fertilizer particles was developed. The system proved capable of measuring the velocity of a 4 mm particle travelling at 29 m / s within an accuracy of 5 % and dimensions within 2 %. Two forms of the detector are discussed, namely, one and two dimensional versions respectively.

The photon histogram records an increase in photon emissions during times that the transistor switches on or off. By detecting the combined photon emissions of pairs p- and n-channel transistors contained in logic gates, it is possible to use the resulting histogram to determine the locations in time of the rising and <b>falling</b> <b>edges</b> of the signal at that node.
