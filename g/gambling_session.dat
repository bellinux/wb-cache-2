40|$|The {{increasing}} {{sophistication of}} gambling products afforded by electronic tech- nologies facilitates increased accessibility to gambling, {{as well as}} encouraging rapid and continuous play. This poses several challenges from a responsible gambling perspective, in terms of facilitating player self-awareness and self-control. The same technological advancements in gambling that may facilitate a loss of control may {{also be used to}} provide responsible gambling tools and solutions to reduce gambling-related harm. Indeed, several harm-minimisation strategies have been devised that aim to facilitate self-awareness and self- control within a <b>gambling</b> <b>session.</b> Such strategies include the use of breaks in play, 'pop-up' messaging, limit setting, and behavioural tracking. The present paper reviews the theoretical argument underpinning the application of specific harm-minimisation tools, as well as pro- viding one of the first critical reviews of the empirical research assessing their efficacy, in terms of influencing gambling cognitions and behaviour...|$|E
40|$|In 2000, the NSW Government legislated for {{gambling}} venues, including registered clubs, {{to implement}} certain responsible gambling measures.

However, no evidence exists that such measures are effective in minimising harm and protecting consumers in gambling. This paper reports on a 2002 - 2003 research project, funded by the NSW Casino Community Benefit Fund, which sought to address this gap in knowledge. It surveyed members from ten large Sydney clubs to assess their level of awareness of their clubs’ responsible gambling measures, how adequate they consider these measures to be, and whether these measures have changed their gambling behaviour in terms of frequency, expenditure and <b>gambling</b> <b>session</b> length. Comparisons are drawn between ‘problem’ and ‘recreational’ gamblers to inform a more grounded approach to responsible conduct of gambling, one that is better targeted at those most at risk of gambling-related harm...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} argued that {{generating}} pop-up messages during electronic gambling sessions, which cause a player to engage in self-appraisal of their gambling behaviour, instil greater control and awareness of behaviour (Monaghan, Computers in Human Behaviour, 25, 202 – 207, 2009). Consideration for the potential interaction between the messaging’s efficacy and gambling outcome (winning or losing) is lacking however. Thirty participants took part in a repeated-measures experiment where they gambled on the outcome of a computer-simulated gambling task. Outcome was manipulated by the experimenter to induce winning and losing streaks. Participants gambled at a significantly faster speed and a higher average stake size, which resulted in a greater betting intensity in the Loss condition compared to the Win condition. Computer generated self-appraisal messaging was then applied during the <b>gambling</b> <b>session,</b> which was able to significantly reduce the average speed of betting in the Loss condition only, demonstrating an interaction effect between computer generated messaging and gambling outcome...|$|E
30|$|Many of the {{participants}} were not spending large sums of money during typical <b>gambling</b> <b>sessions.</b> The reasons for this were twofold; some did not spend vast amounts because they did not have much money to spend.

Often, these mature players were not familiar with available jackpots and choices for poker machine playing. These players normally spend only about $ 10 - $ 20 per session. It does not matter whether they win or lose because they play poker machines in order to go out, maintain an active life, and socialise with their friends.

40|$|A {{range of}} gamblers, from low-frequency social gamblers through to problem gamblers in treatment, participated in focus groups {{discussing}} {{the characteristics of}} Electronic Gaming Machines (EGMs) that they found attractive. Analyses of the resulting transcripts resulted in two groups of EGM characteristics being identified as important, one group associated with winning and one with betting. Overall, free spin features were identified in all groups as the most attractive characteristic of EGMS. Beyond that it was smaller win-related characteristics, and low-denomination machines with multiple playable lines that were associated with increased duration and intensity of gambling behaviour. The important characteristics were consistent across different levels of gamblers, with the key behavioural difference being a self-reported ‘expertise’, and ‘strategic’ approach to gambling amongst higher-frequency gamblers and problem gamblers in treatment. The key characteristics all occur frequently and result in more wins and extended <b>gambling</b> <b>sessions.</b> The patterns identified resonated with established behavioural principles, and with models describing the development of problem gambling and addictions more generally...|$|R
40|$|This paper helps {{address a}} {{deficiency}} of gender specific research into gambling. Using predominantly non-parametric tests, the paper analyses data from 1 257 female and 1 743 male respondents {{in a telephone}} survey of 3 000 members selected randomly from six large Sydney clubs. The results support female gambling stereotypes of lower individual bets and lower overall expenditure, but not of lower participation and frequency of play, and shorter duration of <b>gambling</b> <b>sessions.</b> Further, regular female gaming machine players appear more likely than non-regular female players to be migrants, either young or old, and from lower socio-economic groups. Regular female gaming machine players also appear to forgo the social side of playing machines, to spend more overall, and to be more at risk of problem gambling than non-regular female players. Finally, the distinguishing socio-demographic characteristics and machine playing behaviours of the regular male gaming machine players {{are very similar to}} those for the regular female gaming machine players...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} observe the influence of autonomic arousal on subsequent gambling behavior. Thirty-seven male and 32 female regular Electronic Gaming Machine (EGM) players were recruited through newspaper advertisements. Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} either: (1) a control condition, or (2) an experimental condition that introduced a loud white-noise event (80 db) at fixed 120 s intervals throughout the 5 -min EGM <b>gambling</b> <b>session.</b> Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) measurements showed that the manipulation was successful in elevating autonomic arousal. The results showed differences in behavioral response to the manipulation based on prior experience with gambling problems. Persons with many gambling problems had lower average bet-sizes in the white-noise condition compared to the control, while those with few or no problems had higher average bet-sizes. The results suggest that arousal may provide different signals to gamblers with few versus many problems. Gamblers with many problems may interpret their arousal as a sign that they will soon lose money, while gamblers with few or no problems may associate feelings of arousal exclusively with winning...|$|E
40|$|Losses {{disguised}} as wins (LDWs) appear to reinforce gambling persistence. However, {{little research has}} examined this phenomenon with real gamblers in natural gambling settings. We aimed {{to examine the relationship}} between within-session outcome size and subsequent gambling persistence. Account-based gambling data of individuals playing LDW games over a randomly selected day (2, 035, 339 bets made by 8636 individuals) was examined. We used a logistic mixed effects model {{to examine the relationship between}} the outcome of the previous bet (loss, LDW and real wins) and the odds of continuing betting in a game session. The odds of continuing betting in a game session were positively associated with the outcome of the previous bet. Compared to LDWs, losses lowered the odds of continuing a game session. In contrast, real wins implied greater odds of continuing a game session compared to LDWs. It is concluded that LDWs increase the likelihood of continuing betting compared to losses, but decrease the likelihood of continuing to gamble compared to real wins. As LDWs increase the number of bets made within a <b>gambling</b> <b>session,</b> and hence within-session gambling persistence, LDWs may potentially play an etiological role in the development of gambling problems over time...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study, we {{assessed}} whether undergraduate electronic gaming machine (EGM) gamblers {{would be more}} apt to set a time limit and spend less time gambling when asked to consider setting an explicit time limit prior to their <b>gambling</b> <b>session.</b> To this end, participants (N ¼ 43) {{were randomly assigned to}} a time limit pop-up condition or control condition, both of which involved gambling on an EGM in a virtual reality (VR) casino. In the time limit pop-up condition, participants were asked (via pop-up message) to consider setting a time limit on play and entering that limit in an available text box prior to commencing play. In the no time limit pop-up condition, participants engaged in play immediately upon accessing the EGM in the VR casino (i. e. they were not exposed to a time limit pop-up message). As predicted, participants who were explicitly asked to consider setting a time limit on their EGM play were signiﬁcantly more likely to do so and spent less time gambling than those who were not given such instructions. The results provide preliminary support for the contention that setting a time limit on EGM play is an effective responsible gambling strategy...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Although alcohol intake and {{gambling}} often co-occur in related venues, there is conflicting evidence regarding {{the effects of}} alcohol expectancy and intake on gambling behavior. We therefore conducted an experimental investigation {{of the effects of}} alcohol expectancy and intake on slot machine gambling behavior. Methods Participants were 184 (females[*]=[*] 94) individuals [age range: 18 – 40 (mean[*]=[*] 21. 9) years] randomized to four independent conditions differing in information/expectancy about beverage (told they received either alcohol or placebo) and beverage intake [actually ingesting low (target blood alcohol concentration [BAC]    0. 40  mg/L; ≈ 0. 80  mg/L) amounts of alcohol]. All participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing demographic variables, subjective intoxication, alcohol effects (stimulant and sedative), and gambling factors (behavior and problems, evaluation, and beliefs). Participants also gambled on a simulated slot machine. Results A significant main effect of beverage intake on subjective intoxication and alcohol effects was detected as expected. No significant main or interaction effects were detected for number of <b>gambling</b> <b>sessions,</b> bet size and variation, remaining credits at termination, reaction time, and game evaluation.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, there have been an {{increasing}} number of gaming operators that have incorporated on-screen pop-up messages while gamblers play on slot machines and/or online as one of a range of tools to help encourage responsible gambling. Coupled with this, there has also been an increase in empirical research into whether such pop-up messages are effective, particularly in laboratory settings. However, very few studies have been conducted on the utility of pop-up messages in real-world gambling settings. The present study investigated the effects of normative and self-appraisal feedback in a slot machine pop-up message compared to a simple (non-enhanced) pop-up message. The study was conducted in a real-world gambling environment by comparing the behavioral tracking data of two representative random samples of 800, 000 <b>gambling</b> <b>sessions</b> (i. e., 1. 6 million sessions in total) across two conditions (i. e., simple pop-up message versus an enhanced pop-up message). The results indicated that the additional normative and self-appraisal content doubled the number of gamblers who stopped playing after they received the enhanced pop-up message (1. 39 %) compared to the simple pop-up message (0. 67 %). The data suggest that pop-up messages influence {{only a small number of}} gamblers to cease long playing sessions and that enhanced messages are slightly more effective in helping gamblers to stop playing in-session...|$|R

40|$|In 2002 to 2003, an {{evaluation}} of the ClubSafe responsible gambling program, imple-mented by clubs in New South Wales, Australia, was conducted (Hing, 2003). The study surveyed members from ten large Sydney clubs to assess their level of awareness of their clubs’ responsible gambling measures, how adequate they considered these measures to be, and whether these measures had changed their gambling behaviour in terms of frequency, expenditure and <b>gambling</b> <b>session</b> length. Comparisons were drawn between “problem” and “recreational” gamblers. This paper draws on that study to reflect on some implica-tions of its findings for clubs in New Zealand. This is pertinent, given that Clubs New Zea-land have recently licensed the ClubSafe program from Clubs NSW for implementation in New Zealand clubs. However, there are many differences between the clubs in these two jurisdictions. These include size of gaming machine installations, staff and management training and education, membership numbers, and patronage by visitors. Additionally, differences exist between the two in the legislative requirements for responsible conduct of gambling, the competitive environments they face and certain characteristics of their re-spective markets.

40|$|Research {{indicates}} that gamblers frequently set self-imposed limits {{on how much}} time and money they wish to gamble in a given <b>gambling</b> <b>session,</b> yet consistently gamble more than initially intended. The emotional and arousing impact of gambling, as well as dissociative states gamblers experience whilst gambling, may contribute to this behavioural shift which reflects a failure in self-control. Essential then, {{is the need for}} harm minimisation strategies aimed at allowing a gambler to stay in control of their decisions and behaviour during gambling, whilst concurrently limiting the negative impact this may have on the gambling experience for those who frequently stay in control. The following article evaluates the use of limit setting and pre-commitment, the use of ‘cooling off ’ periods, and restricting access to additional funds as harm minimisation strategies, in terms of their efficacy in facilitating self-control in problem and non-problem gambling populations. As with any potential mass intervention, {{such as the use of}} mandatory limit setting, the need for robust empirical evidence to prove its efficacy is essential. Existing research, while providing promise, falls short of this criterion, indicating a requirement for more stringent empirical research to best guide responsible gambling practices aimed at facilitating player control during gambling...|$|E
40|$|Although {{structural}} characteristics may {{be important}} moderators of behaviour and cognition in gambling, empirical investigations of such characteristics are still needed. Through three laboratory based studies, this thesis presents original research {{on the effects of}} structural characteristics in gambling. The main aim of study one was to investigate how within-session events affect subsequent gambling behaviour and gambling urges. Specifically, the aim was to investigate whether making a relatively large win early in a session involving a computer-simulated gambling situation would lead to prolonged gambling and elevated gambling urges, compared with making an identical win late in the <b>gambling</b> <b>session.</b> The main aim of study two was to generate more knowledge about speed as a structural characteristic in gambling by comparing the effects of three different bet-to-outcome intervals on gamblers bet sizes, game evaluations and the illusion of control while gambling on a computer-simulated slot machine. The main aim of study three was to corroborate and elaborate on the existing findings concerning gambling and music by investigating if the tempo of a musical soundtrack in a gambling situation would influence the number of bets placed, speed of placing bets and evaluation of the game. In order to achieve these aims, three laboratory based experiments were conducted in which non-pathological participants took part in a computer simulated gambling simulation. In Study 1, no effect of the sequential occurrence of the big win on subsequent gambling behaviour and cognitions was found. In Study 2, at-risk gamblers had a higher average bet size in the fastest version of the gambling situation, compared to no-problem gamblers. No effect was found on game evaluations or illusion of control. In Study 3, participants listening to slow music placed more bets than did participants listening to fast music, whereas participants listening to fast music placed bets quicker than did participants listening to slow music. The results from these studies add to existing knowledge by building on previous findings and they help generate proposals for future investigations. The findings may also prove useful for clinical practice if incorporated into psychoeducational approaches. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background {{and aims}} Online {{gambling}} {{appears to have}} special features, such as anonymity, speed of play and permanent availability, which {{may contribute to the}} facilitation and increase in gambling practice, potentially leading to problem gambling. The aims of this study were to assess sociodemographic characteristics, gambling practice and impulsive sensation seeking among a population of regular poker players with different levels of gambling intensity and to compare online and live players. Methods 245 regular poker players (180 online players and 65 live players) completed online self-report scales assessing sociodemographic data, pathological gambling (SOGS), gambling practice (poker questionnaire) and impulsive sensation seeking (ImpSS). We used SOGS scores to rank players according to the intensity of their gambling practice (non-pathological gamblers, problem gamblers and pathological gamblers). Results All poker players displayed a particular sociodemographic profile: {{they were more likely to}} be young men, executives or students, mostly single and working full-time. Online players played significantly more often whereas live players reported significantly longer <b>gambling</b> <b>sessions.</b> Sensation seeking was high across all groups, whereas impulsivity significantly distinguished players according to the intensity of gambling. Discussion Our results show the specific profile of poker players. Both impulsivity and sensation seeking seem to be involved in pathological gambling, but playing different roles.

40|$|Gambling has {{typically}} {{been considered}} a predominately male activity. However, recent prevalence surveys have shown greater numbers of females are now gambling. Much of the gambling literature suggests online gamblers {{are more likely to}} be male, and that problem gamblers {{are more likely to be}} male. Males and females are also likely to be gambling for different reasons and have a preference for different gambling activities. Little is known about the pattern of play among female online gamblers. The aim of this survey was to develop a better profile of female online gamblers and to examine any gender differences between males and females in terms of how and why they gamble online, their frequency of online gambling, patterns of play, as well as attitudes to online gambling. The survey was posted on 32 international online gambling websites and was completed by 975 online gamblers (including 175 female online gamblers). Chi-square tests of association were conducted to examine the association between gender and a range of variables. The results showed that females had been gambling online for a shorter duration of time than males, had much shorter online <b>gambling</b> <b>sessions,</b> different motivations for gambling online (i. e. to practice for free, to spend less money and out of boredom), and experienced online gambling differently to males, with increased feelings of guilt and shame for gambling online.

40|$|The {{illusion}} of control {{refers to the}} overestimation of {{the probability of a}} win following a personal action in a gambling game. This thesis identifies gaps in the body of literature on factors influencing the illusion, uses a theoretically motivated methodology to address them, and tests the theory underlying the methodology. The thesis consists of a literature review and three papers. The review focuses on factors found to influence the illusion – factors such as the number of response options available in the gambling task, the degree of need for money, the average frequency of successes/wins in a sequence of rounds, and success-slope (i. e., whether wins are concentrated at the beginning or end of the sequence). The review draws attention to problems with the way the {{illusion of}} control has been measured in studies of success-frequency and success-slope. This observation, in turn, raises questions as to whether success-frequency and success-slope are, indeed, factors that influence the illusion. The review goes on to discuss the psychological processes underlying the effects of various influencing factors. Two relatively unexplored arguments are advanced. The first is that people in gambling tasks engage in problem-solving. Problem-solving involves searching for actions that bring about the desired outcome, which, in gambling settings, is a substantial monetary win. The greater the number of available response options and the need for money, the more likely the player is to still be searching for effective actions at the time that her perceived control is measured. Such a player is, in turn, less likely to report having 'no control' over the task. A second and related argument is that the actions people consider during problem-solving are influenced by their beliefs about the task at hand. In gambling, beliefs in the gambler's fallacy (Oskarsson et al., 2009) and beliefs about supernatural agents such as luck and God (Atran & Norenzayan, 2004) are particularly relevant. In line with terminology used by Rothbaum, Weisz and Snyder (1982), it is proposed that the illusion of control has two variants, primary and secondary, influenced by the gambler's fallacy and beliefs in supernatural agents respectively. The first two papers describe re-examinations of the effects of success-frequency (N = 97) and success-slope (N = 334) using a methodology consistent with the above explanation. Like most studies of these two factors, the experiments involved a <b>gambling</b> <b>session</b> under a particular success-frequency or success-slope condition, followed by a post-experimental questionnaire about the degree of perceived control over task outcomes. The novel aspects of the methodology included, for example, the separate measurement of the illusion's two variants. Success-frequency was found not to influence the illusion of control when it was measured in this way, while the influence of success-slope was confirmed, in that an 'ascending slope' (a concentration of wins {{at the end of the}} sequence) was found to be associated with higher illusory primary control. The finding regarding success-slopes suggests that people expected to learn the correct way of playing through trial-and-error, which is consistent with the above argument that people engage in problem-solving when gambling. The third paper describes a confirmatory factor analysis of a survey about erroneous gambling-related beliefs (N = 329). Items were based on interviews with people who gamble regularly, and, therefore, represented illusions of control – problem-solving solutions based on some playing experience. Consistently with the second argument presented above, the factor analysis showed that the items could be described in terms of two latent factors reflecting the gambler's fallacy and beliefs about supernatural agents, respectively.

40|$|Electronic {{gambling}} machines (EGMs) {{are associated with}} the highest prevalence rates of problem gambling. The role of arousal in reinforcing gambling activity has been recognised for a long time. It is possible that the many event-types (losses, near-misses, wins, and large wins) generated by EGMs create a psychophysiological roller-coaster that is captivating and possibly addictive for some individuals. However, physiological changes associated with win and loss events on EGMs have not been investigated in a systematic manner. This area of research is important for several reasons. Converging evidence from several domains indicates that biological factors, especially arousal mechanisms are likely to have an important role to play in the development and maintenance of problem gambling. It is possible that objectively measured physiological characteristics may allow for discrimination between problem and non-problem gamblers. This information may aid early detection of problem gambling and the assessment of treatment progression. The current program of research was designed to systematically examine the nature and significance of psychophysiological responses to wins and losses on EGMs as they occurred in real time. Study A investigated 12 non-problem gamblers in a laboratory environment and successfully trialled contemporary psychophysiological equipment and methodologies. This study showed that psychophysiological measures [skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate (HR) ] could be captured on a second-by-second basis and that SCL could reliably differentiate between win and loss events on an EGM. Study B replicated and extended the findings of Study A. Losses, wins, fake-wins (where a return is paid, but is less than that has been wagered), and large wins were examined among 24 non-problem gamblers under high- and low-stake conditions. v The results demonstrated significant increases from baseline for SCL, but not HR, following wins but not losses. Study B also revealed that increases in SCL were moderated by the amount won and wagered. Study C was a field study and extended the laboratory findings by monitoring HR and SCL of 6 problem and 6 non-problem gamblers as they experienced wins and losses on EGMs in a licensed club. Both HR and SCL increased relative to baseline in non-problem gamblers following wins but not following losses. More importantly, problem gamblers exhibited significantly fewer changes in HR and SCL to wins during <b>gambling</b> <b>sessions,</b> relative to non-problem gamblers. Clinical tools based on psychophysiological responses to rewards (wins) may help differentiate between those who develop problem gambling and those who do not, and needs to be further investigated...|$|R
5000|$|After his {{official}} retirement from pool in 1975, Lassiter {{continued to play}} in some low-profile tournaments, but due to years of hard living while {{on the road and}} marathon <b>gambling</b> <b>sessions</b> that would last into {{the early hours of the}} morning, he often was not able to play quite as well as he had in his younger days. Even so, many pool players during those years claim he was still one of the greatest players alive, and a force to be reckoned with on the pool table. Lassiter did come out of retirement, along with many other pool greats, to compete twice in [...] "The Legendary Stars of Pocket Billiards Tournament," [...] once in January 1982 at Harrah's Marina Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, and again in 1983, at the Claridge Hotel and Casino, also in Atlantic City. The players who competed in the 1982 tournament were Lassiter, Joe Balsis, Babe Cranfield, Jimmy Moore, U.J. Puckett, Irving Crane, Minnesota Fats, and Willie Mosconi. In 1983, the line-up was the same minus Balsis and Cranfield, and with Jimmy Caras added. These were round-robin tournaments, in which each player would be matched against the others in a single match, with each playing the same number of matches, and receiving a set number of points for each match won. Each match consisted of one seven-ball set, race to four games, one nine-ball set, race to four games, and in the event of a tie, one eight-ball set, best two out of three games. At the 1983 tournament, which was televised on the then-fledgling ESPN network, Luther Lassiter pitched a shutout. He won all six of his matches for 20 points each, amassing a perfect score of 120 points and the first place prize of $10,000. After Lassiter defeated Willie Mosconi to put the exclamation point on the tournament, current WPA World Nine-ball Champion at the time and commentator for the match, Allen Hopkins, remarked to co-commentator Chris Berman, [...] "This is no surprise to me; Wimpy's a great nine-ball player. I watched him play, and he looked like the young Wimpy, from years back. He played great. The way he played this tournament he could have beat anybody, including players." [...] After defeating U.J. Puckett earlier in the same tournament, Lassiter said in response to Berman's praise of his playing, [...] "Well, I'm the youngest and I'm still lucky." ...|$|R
5|$|Rowan {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, Rowan joined Dr. James Chambers and three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several beers and games of whist, Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. Rowan had determined not to <b>gamble</b> during this <b>session</b> of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between Chambers and Rowan. The exact nature of the argument is not known. Some accounts claim it was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged between the two men. A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|R
50|$|The {{same year}} he {{registered}} as a Democrat, Kraft became a party organizer, campaigning tirelessly {{for the election}} of Robert Kennedy and receiving a personal letter from the senator, thanking him for his efforts. By his senior year, Kraft had become a lackadaisical student, drinking, taking drugs, and regularly attending all-night <b>gambling</b> and poker <b>sessions</b> with other students. The lack of commitment to his studies in his final year resulted in Kraft's failing to graduate from Claremont in June 1967. Kraft had to repeat his econometrics class, resulting in deferment of his graduation by eight months. In February 1968, Kraft graduated from Claremont Men's College with a Bachelor of Arts in economics.|$|R
50|$|Oscar's Grind {{divides the}} entire <b>gambling</b> event into <b>sessions.</b> A session is a {{sequence}} of consecutive wagers made until 1 unit of profit is won. Each session begins by betting 1 unit, and ends by winning 1 unit of profit. If the gambler loses, the session continues and the bet is repeated. Each time the gambler wins the game following a lost game, the bet is increased by 1 unit. This increase is not performed if the current bet warrants achieving at least 1 unit of profit in total, in case the next game is won. On the contrary, the bet size {{in such a situation}} should be decreased to assure exactly 1 unit is won. Given infinite money and time, this makes sure that every session ends with a 1 unit profit.|$|R
