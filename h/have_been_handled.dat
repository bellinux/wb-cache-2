5|$|If, in {{the famous}} garden and {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>handled</b> vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician {{that he had to}} give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{gameplay}} is its focus on guns over swords and magic. When deciding upon the game's basics, the team {{wanted to create a}} cinematic feeling in battles. If they had gone with a more traditional battle system, then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to the prevalence of close combat. Likewise, they wanted the cinematic feel to persist throughout the whole game rather than restricted to cutscenes. A major challenge was {{to strike a balance between}} accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that might be made of up of both action game and RPG players. This resulted in the addition of strategy elements. Another wish was to create something new and fresh in the RPG market. When creating the gameplay style, the team looked at action movies such as The Matrix and Rebellion during their research. Despite its fast-paced action, the game relies heavily upon strategic, turn-based gameplay. During early development, the game was based on a real-time system and meant for only one character to be controlled by the player; the other two would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>handled</b> by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). After some testing, they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off-screen without the player noticing or the AI not directing them properly.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{enactment}} of the law in December 2011, a state supreme court judge halted the plan in June 2012 by a lawsuit bought by the yellow cab industry. The judge considered the law unconstitutional {{due to the fact that}} the legislative actions on taxi services should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>handled</b> by city government, not the state government.|$|E
25|$|Another {{distinction}} is the unavailability {{of a jury}} in equity: the judge is the trier of fact. In the American legal system, the right of jury trial in civil cases tried in federal court is guaranteed by the Seventh Amendment in Suits at common law, cases that traditionally would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>handled</b> by the law courts. The {{question of whether a}} case should be determined by a jury depends largely on the type of relief the plaintiff requests. If a plaintiff requests damages in the form of money or certain other forms of relief, such as the return of a specific item of property, the remedy is considered legal, and a jury is available as the fact-finder. On the other hand, if the plaintiff requests an injunction, declaratory judgment, specific performance, modification of contract, or some other non-monetary relief, the claim would usually be one in equity.|$|E

That was before you were born." [...] Within a few months his government must deal with the aftermath of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and following the Princess's funeral, ElizabethII tells Blair that lessons must be learned from the way things <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>handled.</b> Social occasions with the Queen are also recalled, including a gathering at Balmoral Castle where Prince Philip is described manning the barbecue while ElizabethII dons a pair of rubber gloves to wash up afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the graphic}} {{capabilities}} of BioShock were also criticised by players. The initial {{release of the}} game was found to use a field of view (FOV) in widescreen that presented a smaller view compared to the game running at a 4:3 screen resolution, conflicting with original reports from a developer on how widescreen would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>handled.</b> Though the choice of FOV was a design decision made during development, Irrational included an option for [...] "Horizontal FOV Lock" [...] in the December 2007 patch that allows widescreen users a wider field of view, without cutting anything off the image vertically. BioShock was also criticized for not supporting pixel shader 2.0b video cards (such as the Radeon X800/X850), which were considered high-end graphics cards in 2004–2005, and accounted for about 24% of surveyed hardware collected through Valve's Steam platform {{at the time of}} BioShock release.|$|E
500|$|Speaking to The Observers Sue Arnold, Finch {{believed}} The Archers {{had done}} [...] "a great service for women's health" [...] by tackling {{the subject of}} breast cancer. Finch later revealed that she had received letters from listeners about the storyline and one woman wrote to thank her because she had found a lump in her breast after listening to the show. Finch also named the storyline {{as one of her}} Archers highlights. Delyth Morgan, chief executive of Breakthrough said The Archers treated the subject of breast cancer [...] "as sensibly as one can reasonably expect." [...] Morgan continues saying that Breakthrough liked how the show had highlighted the effect that a cancer diagnosis can have on a partner. In contrast, the radio series Feedback reported that the storyline had initially attracted a negative response from listeners, who felt the subject should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>handled</b> with more optimism.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the consultation between Kerr, Charteris and Charles was maintained to ensure that the Queen and the British Parliament were not part of the discussion. Assistant Private Secretary to the Queen in 1975, Sir William Heseltine, who along with Charteris informed her of the dismissal, has maintained that it came as a surprise to all three of them; that he considered Kerr's actions imprudent; and that he believed that this opinion was shared by Charteris. A memorandum by Sir Paul Hasluck of his conversation with Charteris supports this suggestion, and that disillusionment with Kerr's character led the Palace to apply pressure for his resignation. The Queen's opinion is unknown, but Heseltine has stated: [...] "I think she is an old and wily bird about her own views ... to the extent that I could divine what she felt, I think she felt the same ... I’m reasonably confident myself that she thought it could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>handled</b> better.” ...|$|E
500|$|... "Traveling" [...] {{was written}} and {{composed}} by Utada, whilst production was handled by Utada, her father Teruzane Utada, and long-time collaborator Akira Miyake. This was Utada's first original single to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>handled</b> by Utada, her father, and Miyake since her single releases from her debut album First Love (1999); she had primarily worked with American producers, such as Rodney Jenkins, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis for her second studio album Distance (2001). The song included live instrumentation by Saito Mitsutaka, {{who played the}} bass guitar, and Tsunemi Kazuhide, who played synthesizers, while it was arranged by Utada and Kawano Kei. The song was recorded and mixed by Ugajin Masaaki and Matsui Atushi in 2001 at Bunkamura Studio, Shibuya, Tokyo. It was released as the second single from her fourth studio and third Japanese language album, Deep River (2002). Since then, the song has been remastered and re-released twice; the first on April 1, 2004, and the second time on December 9, 2014 for Utada's first greatest hits album Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1 (2003).|$|E
500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com {{said the}} fact that the wedding scene works shows how genuine the {{characters}} are and how well they are presented by the writers. Sundermann also praised the cold open with Ron ripping his tooth out, and said he enjoyed the way Ann Perkins' character has continued to develop through the season. Steve Kandell of New York magazine called April and Andy perhaps the [...] "most convincingly matched and resoundingly sympathetic couple in sitcom history", and said their storylines <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>handled</b> much more effectively than those of Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly in the NBC comedy The Office. Kandell was more critical of the Ann character, and said she did not seem to fit {{as a part of the}} show anymore. Some reviews were less positive. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said there were individual elements of the episode she enjoyed, but felt the wedding happened too quickly and the lack of buildup reduced the tension leading up to the event. Joel Keller of TV Squad said, [...] "In a mostly stellar season, this one sits near the bottom of the list." [...] Keller said the wedding ruined an otherwise funny episode, and that it felt ineffective and rushed because April and Andy were fighting with each other only four episodes earlier. He also criticized the Ann Perkins character: [...] "I've never seen Rashida Jones play a character this wishy-washy before, and it's not pleasant to watch." ...|$|E

The Jersey Evening Post criticized police tactics, as did MPs in the UK Parliament. An emergency sitting of the States assembly was called – though the assembly subsequently voted against a proposition critical of the police's actions. Svyret's lawyer complained that data protection laws were being used to restrict his freedom of expression, contrary to human rights.

[...] On February 10, 2006, Brown again testified before Congress, this time placing blame on the Department of Homeland Security for the poor handling of the disaster, asserting that the anti-terrorism focus of the department had caused it to deny resources needed to properly operate FEMA. In his February 2006 testimony, Brown also contradicted earlier claims that the White House was unaware of levees having been breached, stating: [...] "For them to claim that we didn't have awareness of it is just baloney." ...|$|E
