5|$|Durkheim saw {{religion}} {{as the most}} fundamental social institution of humankind, and one {{that gave rise to}} other social forms. It was the religion that gave humanity the strongest sense of collective consciousness. Durkheim saw the {{religion as}} a force that emerged in the early hunter and gatherer societies, as the emotions collective <b>effervescence</b> run high in the growing groups, forcing them to act in a new ways, and giving them a sense of some hidden force driving them. Over time, as emotions became symbolized and interactions ritualized, religion became more organized, giving a rise to the division between the sacred and the profane. However, Durkheim also believed that religion was becoming less important, as it was being gradually superseded by science and the cult of an individual.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with <b>effervescence,</b> but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E

40|$|Plan: This review {{discusses}} overall {{approaches of}} gastroretentive drug delivery systems and limelight on floating drug delivery its formulation development and discusses various evaluation parameters. Preface: Oral drug delivery of {{nearly half of}} the drugs gets thwarted owing to the high lipophilic nature. Bioavailability of these drugs being function of their aqueous solubility and dissolution tends to exhibit low magnitude and high intra and inter subject variability. Many drugs have a short biological half life and thus have invents potential in ameliorating GI absorption. To overcome the poor bioavailability and patient complaints much attention has been given to Gastro retentive drug delivery system, although there are various approaches in retaining the drug within the gastric region. Outcome: Floating dosage form can be broadly divided in to <b>effervescences</b> and non <b>effervescences</b> both have its own merits and demerits. To state that a given floating drug delivery system successfully float,its lag time should be within 5 min. Factors affecting floatation are size, shape, density, single or multiple unit, fed or unfed state, nature and frequent of food, gender, age, patient related etc. Evaluation include buoyancy study, floating and swelling behavior, drug release in additional to conventional evaluation, in vivo evaluation is important since the results may not adequately correlate with in vitro results. The usual reported in vivo floatation studies include x-ray, gamma scintigraphy, gastroscophy, magnetic marker, ultrasonograph...|$|R

25|$|Solubility {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with the ability to 'dissolve' a substance, because the solution might also occur because of a chemical reaction. For example, zinc 'dissolves' (with <b>effervescence)</b> in hydrochloric acid as a result of a chemical reaction releasing hydrogen gas in a displacement reaction. The zinc ions are soluble in the acid.|$|E
25|$|A {{beverage}} {{that clearly}} {{made its debut}} during the 17th century was sparkling champagne. The credit for that development goes primarily and erroneously to Dom Perignon, the wine-master in a French abbey. Although the oldest recorded sparkling wine is Blanquette de Limoux, in 1531, the English scientist and physician Christopher Merret documented the addition of sugar to a finished wine to create a second fermentation six years before Dom Perignon joined the Abbey of Hautvillers and almost 40 years before it was claimed that he invented Champagne. Around 1668, Perignon used strong bottles, invented a more efficient cork (and one that could contain the <b>effervescence</b> in those strong bottles), and began developing the technique of blending the contents. However, another century would pass before problems, especially bursting bottles, would be solved and champagne would become popular.|$|E

Elemental analysis {{along with the}} molecular ion peak at m/z 168.04 [M]+· [...] agreed with the molecular formula C 8 H 8 O 4. The IR spectrum revealed characteristic absorption bands for hydroxyl group (3336  cm− 1) and phenyl ring (1608 and 1489  cm− 1). The presence of phenolic −OH group was further confirmed with the positive ferric chloride test. The IR spectrum also showed absorption bands at 3463 and 1685  cm− 1 corresponded to carboxyl group which was further confirmed {{by the appearance of}} <b>effervescences</b> with NaHCO 3. The 1 H NMR spectrum indicated the presence of two ortho coupled doublets at δ 7.74 and 6.75 corresponding to the H- 6 and H- 5 aromatic protons, respectively. The downfield shift of proton H- 6 is due to the presence of carboxylic group on adjacent carbon. The presence of two singlets at δ 10.06 and 9.67 integrating for two and one proton was corresponded to the two phenolic −OH and a carboxylic −OH, respectively. Moreover, a sharp singlet at δ 2.24 integrating for three protons indicates the presence of methyl group. The 13 C NMR spectrum exhibited peaks at δ 13.75 and 178.43 which correspond to the presence of methyl and carbonyl carbon, respectively. Further, peaks at δ 148.0 (C- 1), 128.3 (C- 2), 158.60 (C- 3), 158.69 (C- 4), 127.98 (C- 5) and 114.90 (C- 6) showed the presence of six carbons of aromatic ring. In the light of above assignment and by comparing their spectral data and melting points with the reported literature [18], it was concluded that the compound 1 is 3, 4 - dihydroxy - 2 - methylbenzoic acid.|$|R

2500|$|An initial {{burst of}} <b>effervescence</b> {{occurs when the}} Champagne {{contacts}} the dry glass on pouring.

[...] However, after the initial rush, these naturally occurring imperfections are typically too small to consistently act as nucleation points as the surface tension of the liquid smooths out these minute irregularities. The nucleation sites that act as a source for the ongoing <b>effervescence</b> are not natural imperfections in the glass, but actually occur where the glass has been etched by the manufacturer or the customer. This etching is typically done with acid, a laser, or a glass etching tool from a craft shop to provide nucleation sites for continuous bubble formation (note that not all glasses are etched in this way). In 1662 this method was developed in England, as records from the Royal Society show.|$|E

This {{is one of the first}} known accounts of understanding the process of sparkling wine and suggests that British merchants were producing [...] "sparkling Champagne" [...] even before the French Champenois were deliberately making it. Concurrently, advances in glass manufacture in Britain, by George Ravenscroft and others, allowed more robust wine bottle to be made which could contain the <b>effervescence</b> without exploding.
