She suspects that her new neighbour, Raheem (Fred Armisen), is a terrorist because he has maps in his apartment and she has seen him and his brother, Hakeem (Hamza Ahmed), on an agility course in the park.

5|$|The {{limitation}} of the argument so far is that it only shows {{the existence of a}} necessary existent, and that is different from showing the existence of God as worshipped in Islam. An atheist might agree that a necessary existent exists, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> universe itself, or there could be many necessary existents, none of which is God. Avicenna is aware of this limitation, and his works contains numerous arguments to show the necessary existent must have the attributes associated with God identified in Islam.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{the first}} Cairanoolithus fossils {{discovered}} outside of France were first reported by Albert G. Selles in his PhD thesis at Universitat de Barcelona, {{in which he}} also proposed that Cairanoolithus be moved into its own oofamily. Three years later, Selles and Angel Galobart published a comprehensive reanalysis of Cairanoolithus, in which they formally named the new oofamily, Cairanoolithidae, to contain Cairanaoolithus. Contrary to Cousin's conclusions, Selles and Galobart separated the oospecies C. dughii and C. roussetensis. Also, they demonstrated that Cairanoolithus was not the eggs of an ornithopod or sauropod and conjectured that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> eggs of a nodosaur.|$|E

5|$|Lobanov-Rostovsky {{ultimately}} sold Szczerbiec to Prince Anatole Demidov {{who kept}} it {{together with the}} rest of the Demidov collection in his Villa San Donato near Florence. In 1870, the sword was bought for 20,000 French francs by Alexander Basilevsky, Russian ambassador to France and great art collector. In 1878, he displayed Szczerbiec at the World's Fair in Paris. By that time, the scabbard had been lost and the sword itself was presented as of Teutonic origin. It was seen by several Polish visitors who speculated whether <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Polish coronation sword. In 1884, the entire Basilevsky collection was purchased by Emperor Alexander III of Russia for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. Both Polish and other experts at the time expressed doubts as to the authenticity of Szczerbiec held in Russia's largest museum (see Historical replicas below). An international museum congress held in Saint Petersburg in 1913 pronounced the sword a 17th-century replica.|$|E
5|$|The Arcturus did not {{encounter}} the thick mats of sargassum in the Sargasso Sea that Beebe {{was hoping to}} study, but Beebe and his crew experienced great success dredging creatures from the sea {{off the coast of}} Saint Martin and Saba. In the Pacific, they encountered a strange boundary between two currents of very different temperatures, containing a vast diversity of life on the border between the two. He sailed along the border between the currents for several days to document it, theorizing that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> cause of the unusual climate which South America had recently been experiencing. Beebe's study of these currents, and their effect on the climate of South America, is the earliest known study of the phenomenon known as El Niño.|$|E
5|$|The mod {{received}} widespread media acclaim. Edge called DayZ the mod of the year. Wired UKs Quitin Smith said <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> most terrifying game of 2012, and Rock Paper Shotgun's Jim Rossignol {{called it}} the best game he had played so far in 2012. PC Gamer stated the game {{was one of the}} most important things to happen to PC gaming in 2012 and included it in their 2012 list of the top five scariest PC games of all time. Metro called it one of the best games to ever to come out of PC modding and one of the single most impressive experiences available on the system. Eurogamer {{called it the}} best zombie game ever made and the break out phenomenon of PC gaming in 2012. Kotaku called it possibly the greatest zombie game of all time and the most interesting PC game of 2012. PC PowerPlay said DayZ was the most important thing to happen to PC gaming in 2012.|$|E

5|$|While earlier {{findings}} {{suggested that}} the Milky Way galaxy contained more dark matter than Andromeda, and that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> largest in the Local Group - the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope led to the revelation that the Andromeda galaxy contains one trillion stars; at least twice {{the amount of the}} Milky Way’s stars, with the figure being estimated at 200-400 billion. It is also now evident that spanning approximately 220,000 light years across, Andromeda is the largest galaxy in our Local Group, which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy and other minor galaxies. The mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5 solar masses, whereas the Milky Way's mass is estimated to be 8.5 solar masses.|$|E

25|$|The crypt has {{remained}} largely untouched since its consecration in 1123. The crypt is identified by its numerous and densely built pillars.

Local legend tells that the figure is Finn the Giant, builder of the cathedral. Another column has a similar sculpture of a woman, the wife of Finn according to legend.

25|$|The Piraeus Athena {{has been}} {{determined}} to be an original, and many believe that the Athena Mattei exposed in the Louvre is the sole existing copy of it, even though {{the position of the}} right arm is in a different position. There are various artists who have been thought to have possibly made the Piraeus Athena. Some say <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> work of Cephisodotos, who is known to have made a statue of Athena during the fourth century BC. Others say that it may be the work of Euphranor because it shares similarities with one of his other works, the Apollo Patroos. Similarities include a full face and long neck that indicates a similarity in style, according to the scholar, Olga Palagia.|$|E

25|$|In Spain {{and in most}} Spanish-{{speaking}} countries, {{the custom}} is for people to have two surnames. Usually the first surname comes from {{the father and the}} second from the mother, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> other way round. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purpose. A child's first surname will usually be their father's first surname, while the child's second surname will usually be the mother's first surname. For example, if José García Torres and María Acosta Gómez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo García Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames.|$|E
25|$|Concerned about {{corruption}} in Chinese science, some Chinese scientists, including Professor Liu Ming 刘明 of Zhejiang University in his 2005 book Critique of the Academic Evaluation System 学术评价制度批判, argue that interference from {{government officials and}} university bureaucrats makes peer review far less effective in China than <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be.</b> <b>The</b> time scientists spend cultivating politically influential people is lost to scientific research. Liu argues that the command economy mentality of measuring everything by the numbers combined with pervasive political interference results in a great waste of money, human talent as well as considerable {{corruption in}} Chinese science.

25|$|That said, in {{previous}} elections, approximate forecasting of results were achieved by {{assuming that the}} swing in each individual constituency {{will be the same}} across the country. This system, known as uniform national swing (UNS) is used by much of the media in Britain to assess and extrapolate electoral fortunes from opinion poll data, though there has been criticism that such predictions may be naive and unreliable, even from providers of such data. By using UNS projections, several media commentators and politicians have suggested that significant swings towards the Liberal Democrats in the opinion polls may not necessarily amount to significant gains in terms of parliamentary seats, including predictions that even if the Liberal Democrats had the most votes, and Labour the least, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> case that Labour retains the most seats while the Lib Dems have the fewest.|$|E
