25|$|The sole {{prototype}} of the Fairchild XC-120 Packplane, 48-330, c/n 10312, a design with a <b>detachable</b> <b>pod</b> for the cargo converted from a C-119B, was tested at Eglin AFB in 1951, although no production orders followed. Project abandoned in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} from wood {{and covered in}} doped aircraft fabric covering. The glider has a <b>detachable</b> <b>pod</b> to cover the pilot or can be flown open cockpit. It has a constant chord wing with a [...] chord and a [...] span. The wing features dual parallel struts and jury struts, but has no spoilers or other glidepath control devices. The tailplane is also strut-braced. Unlike most earlier primary glider designs that land on a fixed skid, this aircraft has a fixed monowheel.|$|E
50|$|A gun pod is a <b>detachable</b> <b>pod</b> or pack {{containing}} {{machine guns}} or automatic cannon and ancillaries, mounted externally on a vehicle {{such as a}} military aircraft {{which may or may}} not also have its own guns.|$|E
50|$|Pod planes {{have two}} main {{components:}} the flying component: airframe, cockpit and engines; and the capsules: <b>detachable</b> <b>pods</b> (cabin or cargo hold). The flying component {{and the individual}} capsules can be detached {{from each other and}} combined in different ways.|$|R
50|$|The Fieseler Fi 333 was a {{prototype}} transport aircraft developed by Fieseler, and {{backed by the}} Luftwaffe. The aircraft was to utilise <b>detachable</b> <b>pods</b> of varying sizes to carry cargo, a system that would allow a rapid turnaround on the ground. The very tall braced undercarriage was made unretractable so that the fuselage {{would be able to}} take the strain of the heavy cargo.|$|R
50|$|The Focke-Achgelis Fa 284 was {{a project}} to develop a large {{transport}} helicopter, designed in 1943 by Focke-Achgelis {{for use by the}} Luftwaffe. The helicopter was powered by two BMW 801 radial engines, driving transversely-mounted rotors, and was equipped with a large, <b>detachable</b> cargo <b>pod</b> for carrying loads.|$|R
5000|$|The sole {{prototype}} of the Fairchild XC-120 Packplane, 48-330, c/n 10312, a design with a <b>detachable</b> <b>pod</b> for the cargo converted from a C-119B, was tested at Eglin AFB in 1951, although no production orders followed. Project abandoned in 1952.|$|E
50|$|Dogu Mack: A blue tripod heavy mobile mecha {{equipped}} with an electric whip for the right arm, a pincer claw for the left arm, a pair of laser cannons on the head, a 4-tube missile launcher in the torso, and a <b>detachable</b> <b>pod.</b> It {{is one of the}} only heavy mobile mecha not to be duplicated or mass-produced.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} from wood {{and covered in}} doped aircraft fabric covering. The glider has a <b>detachable</b> <b>pod</b> to cover the pilot or can be flown open cockpit. It has a constant chord wing with a 4 ft chord and a 32.5 ft span. The wing features dual parallel struts and jury struts, but has no spoilers or other glidepath control devices. The tailplane is also strut-braced. Unlike most earlier primary glider designs that land on a fixed skid, this aircraft has a fixed monowheel.|$|E
5000|$|QB-17L was the {{designation}} assigned to drone aircraft equipped with radio, radar, television, and other equipment. They were usually painted in red-orange Day-Glo paint with black diagonal stripes for increased visibility. The QB-17N was a drone conversion {{similar to the}} QB-17L but with a different guidance system and not fitted with television cameras. The optical tracking equipment was installed in <b>detachable</b> wingtip <b>pods</b> equipped with explosive bolts and parachutes for recovery of test data {{in the event of}} the loss of the drone.|$|R
40|$|The present work {{is aimed}} {{to assess the}} {{operating}} conditions effect for urban aerial ropeways with a commercial usage, based on measurements obtained from an arrangement of sensors that record the coupling assembly behavior between the <b>detachable</b> gondola <b>pod</b> and the track rope. The work pays {{particular attention to the}} effect caused by external conditions due to the wind loads joined up with other parasite external effects, through the measurement of the engage strains. The cableway gondola continuous cycle has mono-cable of simple ring type...|$|R
5000|$|Their {{most notable}} {{feature is the}} ability to transform—usually into a {{humanoid}} giant robot called Battroid and an in-between mode called GERWALK (Ground Effective Reinforcement of Winged Armament with Locomotive Knee-joint), in which the nose and wings have a pair of [...] "chicken walker" [...] legs extending underneath enabling VTOL, and two arms reaching forward from the sides. Another prevalent (but not universal) design point is the use of a <b>detachable</b> gun <b>pod</b> instead of an internally mounted gun that can be a hand-held weapon in GERWALK and battroid modes. Variable fighters usually also have one or more trainable head-mounted lasers in battroid mode, which are internally stowed or used as fixed armament in fighter and GERWALK modes.|$|R
50|$|VoltAir is {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of Airbus which {{is developing a}} proposed electrically powered airliner that was publicly announced in 2011. The preliminary concept drawings released at that time showed a low unswept wing on a conventional small-diameter fuselage. A large duct at the fuselage's rear contains two counter-rotating propellers, which would be driven by two large electric motors. Power would be supplied by a lithium-air battery pack mounted in a <b>detachable</b> <b>pod</b> on the lower fuselage nose, where it could be removed and replaced {{as part of the}} normal airport turnaround process in passenger-carriage service.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{full-size}} mock-up inspection in April 1949 {{was generally}} favorable, range again became a concern since the J40s and early model J57s had excessive fuel consumption. Despite talk of another revision of specifications {{or even a}} full design competition among aircraft manufacturers, General LeMay, {{now in charge of}} Strategic Air Command, insisted that performance should not be compromised due to delays in engine development. In a final attempt to increase range, Boeing created the larger 464-67, stating that once in production, the range could be further increased in subsequent modifications. Following several direct interventions by LeMay, Boeing was awarded a production contract for thirteen B-52As and seventeen <b>detachable</b> reconnaissance <b>pods</b> on 14 February 1951. The last major design change—also at General LeMay's insistence—was a switch from the B-47 style tandem seating to a more conventional side-by-side cockpit, which increased the effectiveness of the copilot and reduced crew fatigue. Both XB-52 prototypes featured the original tandem seating arrangement with a framed bubble-type canopy.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2003, {{during a}} {{session with the}} House Committee on Armed Services, Air Force Secretary James Roche said that he envisioned a force of 150 FB-22s would equip the service. In 2004, Lockheed Martin officially {{presented}} the FB-22 to the Air Force to meet its requirement for a potential strategic bomber as an interim solution to become operational by 2018. Because of the work already done on the F-22, the cost of developing the FB-22 {{was estimated to be}} as low as 25% of developing a new bomber, with development expected to be US$5–7 billion (2002 dollars), including the airframe cost of US$1 billion (2003 dollars). It was later revealed that six different versions of the bomber were submitted, as targets, payload and range had yet to be defined. In addition, as a stealth bomber, the FB-22 was designed to carry weapons externally while maintaining stealth with the assistance of <b>detachable</b> and faceted <b>pods</b> dubbed [...] "wing weapons bay"; previously, an aircraft could only remain stealthy if it carried its weapons internally. However, the FB-22 in its planned form appears to have been canceled {{in the wake of the}} 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review and subsequent developments as the Department of Defense favored a bomber with much greater range.|$|R
