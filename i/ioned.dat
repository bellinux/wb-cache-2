Behavior was measured and observed to collect information on cracking loads, inclination and size of diagonal cracks, failure modes and loads, s tee 1 strains, and end slip of prestress in 3 strands. Observed behavior was compared to predicted behavior based on the 1983 AASHTO Specifications for Highway Bridges and the 1983 ACI Building Code.
