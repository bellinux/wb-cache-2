40|$|<b>Helical</b> <b>gears</b> {{are widely}} used in {{gearboxes}} due to its low noise and high load carrying capacity, {{but it is difficult}} to diagnose their early faults based on the signals produced by condition monitoring systems, particularly when the gears rotate at low speed. In this paper, a new concept of Root Mean Square (RMS) value calculation using angle domain signals within small angular ranges is proposed. With this concept, a new diagnosis algorithm based on the time pulses of an encoder is developed to overcome the difficulty of fault diagnosis for <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> at low rotational speeds. In this proposed algorithm, both acceleration signals and encoder impulse signal are acquired at the same time. The sampling rate and data length in angular domain are determined based on the rotational speed and size of the gear. The vibration signals in angular domain are obtained by re-sampling the vibration signal of the gear in the time domain according to the encoder pulse signal. The fault features <b>of</b> the <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> at low rotational speed are then obtained with reference to the RMS values in small angular ranges and the order tracking spectrum following the Angular Domain Synchronous Average processing (ADSA). The new algorithm is not only able to reduce the noise and improves the signal to noise ratio by the ADSA method, but also extract s the features <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gear</b> fault from the meshing position of the faulty gear teeth, hence overcoming the difficulty of fault diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>helical</b> <b>gears</b> rotating at low speed.
