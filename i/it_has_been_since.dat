5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> the {{creation}} of the Auxois stud book, only purebred horses and Ardennes and Trait du Nord crosses are allowed to be registered. This is to ensure selection for the desired breed characteristics, which are now a lighter and more active horse than was seen during the time of breeding for horse meat. Horses bred through artificial insemination and embryo transfer are allowed to be registered; those potentially bred through cloning are not. The Syndicat du Cheval de Trait Auxois (Auxois Draft Horse Association) is the national registry, managing the stud book, breed standard and promotion of the breed. An annual breed competition is held in September in Semur-en-Auxois.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 census, 59.4% of the {{population}} of England specified their religion as Christian, 24.7% answered that they had no religion, 5% specified that they were Muslim, while 3.7% of {{the population}} belongs to other religions and 7.2% did not give an answer. Christianity is the most widely practised religion in England, as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> the Early Middle Ages, although it was first introduced much earlier in Gaelic and Roman times. This Celtic Church was gradually joined to the Catholic hierarchy following the 6th-century Gregorian mission to Kent led by StAugustine. The established church of England is the Church of England, which left communion with Rome in the 1530s when HenryVIII was unable to annul his divorce to the aunt of the king of Spain. The church regards itself as both Catholic and Protestant.|$|E

It {{plays in}} black, blue and white kit at the Recreation Ground in the city, where <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> the late 19th century, {{following}} its establishment in 1865.

The team then led the Courage league in six seasons in eight years between 1988–89 and 1995–96, during which time it also won the renamed Pilkington Cup in 1989, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1996. It finally won the Heineken Cup in the 1997–98 season, and topped the Zürich Premiership (now Aviva Premiership) in 2003–04. The team's squad includes several members who also play, or have played in the English national team, including Lee Mears, Rob Webber, Dave Attwood, Nick Abendanon and Matt Banahan.

25|$|Swainson's hawk has {{suffered}} population declines {{since the first}} half of the twentieth century and was Blue-listed in the United States from 1972 to 1982.

It should be noted that Swainson's hawk was removed from the active federal list because it was found to be more abundant than previously thought; it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. It remains listed as a threatened species by the California Department of Fish and Game as <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> 1983.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, when Russian Federation {{experienced}} a severe financial crisis, its military expenditure {{in real terms}} reached its lowest point— barely one-quarter of the USSR's in 1991, and two-fifths {{of the level of}} 1992, the first year of Russia's independent existence. However, since the rise to power of Vladimir Putin and the exposure of the poor state of preparedness amongst Russia's armed forces in the Chechen Wars and the 2008 invasion of Georgian territories (e.g., South Ossetia), Russian military spending has rapidly increased, particularly after the 2008 Russian military reform. According to SIPRI, Russian military spending in real terms in 2012 was the highest <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>since</b> Russian Federation's re-emergence as an independent nation, but is still far lower than the estimated military expenditure of the USSR in 1990 - its final full year of existence (US$291 billion at 2012 prices). The budget expanded from 1998 until 2015, but economic problems including a sharp decline in the oil price mean it will be cut by 5.3% in 2016 despite analysts saying that large increases are required to fund the current equipment plans and accommodate high rates of inflation; the navy may be the most likely victim of cuts.|$|E
