40|$|We use density {{functional}} {{theory to}} determine the equilibrium shape of graphene flakes, through the calculation of the <b>edge</b> orientation dependence of the <b>edge</b> energy and <b>edge</b> stress of graphene nanoribbons. The <b>edge</b> energy is a nearly linear function of <b>edge</b> orientation angle; increasing from the armchair orientation to the zigzag orientation. Reconstruction of the zigzag <b>edge</b> lowers its energy to {{less than that of}} the armchair <b>edge.</b> The <b>edge</b> stress for all <b>edge</b> orientations is compressive, however, reconstruction of the zigzag <b>edge</b> reduces this <b>edge</b> stress to near zero. Hydrogen adsorption is favorable for all <b>edge</b> orientations; dramatically lowering all <b>edge</b> energies and all <b>edge</b> stresses. It also removes the reconstruction of the zigzag <b>edge.</b> Using the new <b>edge</b> energy data, we determine the equilibrium shape of a graphene sheet (with unreconstructed <b>edges)</b> to be hexagonal with straight armchair <b>edges</b> in the presence and absence of hydrogen. However, zigzag <b>edge</b> reconstruction produces graphene flakes with a six-fold symmetry, but with rounded <b>edges.</b> This shape is dominated by near zigzag <b>edges.</b> The compressive <b>edge</b> stresses will lead to <b>edge</b> buckling (out-of-the-plane of the graphene sheet) for all <b>edge</b> orientations, in the absence of hydrogen. Exposing the graphene flake to hydrogen dramatically decreases the buckling amplitude...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, {{we use the}} Hessian tensor in {{differential}} geometry for <b>edge</b> and corner detection. Most <b>edge</b> operators, such as Canny operator, detect <b>edge</b> centers and use gradient magnitude to represent <b>edge</b> strength. In this paper, for each <b>edge,</b> we detect three crucial elements, <b>edge</b> center, <b>edge</b> contrast, and <b>edge</b> span. Once the <b>edge</b> contrast and the <b>edge</b> span have been identified, they can be adjusted for different purposes, like contrast enhancement and sharpness enhancement. In addition, the Hessian tensor {{can be used to}} find corners, which are useful for feature selection and <b>edge</b> linking. Furthermore, based on detected <b>edge</b> elements, we also developed a hybrid method for image segmentation.

30|$|In this paper, we have {{proposed}} the <b>edge</b> adaptive color demosaicking algorithm that effectively estimates the <b>edge</b> direction on the Bayer CFA samples.

To estimate the <b>edge</b> direction in the complicated <b>edge</b> regions, the proposed method classified regions of an image into three types: <b>edge,</b> <b>edge</b> pattern, and flat regions. According to the <b>edge</b> types, the <b>edge</b> direction were effectively estimated and the directional interpolation resulted in clear <b>edge.</b> The proposed <b>edge</b> adaptive demosaicking method improved the overall image quality in terms of consistent <b>edge</b> directions around the <b>edges.</b> The proposed method was compared with the conventional <b>edge</b> directed and nonedge directed methods on the several images including the Bayer raw data. The simulation {{results indicated that the}} proposed method outperforms conventional <b>edge</b> directed algorithms with respect to both objective and subjective criteria.|$|R
