50|$|An {{alternative}} to filtration is centrifugation—instead of filtering {{the mixture of}} solid and liquid particles, the mixture is centrifuged to force the (usually) denser solid to the bottom, where it often forms a firm cake. The liquid above can then be decanted. This method is especially useful for separating solids which do not <b>filter</b> <b>well,</b> such as gelatinous or fine particles. These solids can clog or pass through the filter, respectively.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alterative {{implementation of a}} shunt open-circuited stub for multilayer microwave circuit. With making use of the proposed implementation, a simple and compact bandstop filter with a district bandstop characteristics and a first spurious at the third harmonic is proposed. The proposed filter exhibits about 12. 5 % fractional bandwidth of − 10 [*]dB signal rejection at the center frequency of 2. 04 [*]GHz and flat group delay at the pass bands. Besides, by cascading {{a number of the}} proposed bandstop filters designed at the different frequencies, multiband bandstop filters can be easily realized. A dual- (tri-) band design at the center frequencies of 2 [*]GHz and 3 [*]GHz (and 4 [*]GHz) is designed, realized, and measured. The proposed bandstop <b>filter</b> <b>well</b> suits the nowadays multilayer and compact radio frequency integrated circuit design...|$|E
40|$|For the {{renewable}} energy sources whose outputs vary continuously, a Z-source current-type inverter has been proposed as a possible buck-boost alternative for grid-interfacing. With a unique X-shaped LC network connected between its dc power source and inverter topology, Z-source current-type inverter is however expected to suffer from compounded resonant complications {{in addition to those}} associated with its second-order output filter. To improve its damping performance, this paper proposes the careful integration of Posicast or three-step compensators before the inverter pulse-width modulator for damping triggered resonant oscillations. In total, two compensators are needed for wave-shaping the inverter boost factor and modulation ratio, and they can conveniently be implemented using first-in first-out stacks and embedded timers of modern digital signal processors widely used in motion control applications. Both techniques are found to damp resonance of ac <b>filter</b> <b>well,</b> but for cases of transiting from current-buck to boost state, three-step technique is less effective due to the sudden intermediate discharging interval introduced by its non-monotonic stepping (unlike the monotonic stepping of Posicast damping). These findings have been confirmed both in simulations and experiments using an implemented laboratory prototype...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{intracellular}} distribution of collagen types I, III and V in tenocytes using triple-label immunofluorescence staining technique in high-density tenocyte culture on <b>Filter</b> <b>Well</b> Inserts (FWI). The tenocytes were incubated for 4  weeks under monolayer conditions and for 3  weeks on FWI. At the end of the third week of high-density culture, we observed tenocyte aggregation followed by macromass cluster formation. Immunofluorescence labeling with anti-collagen type I antibody revealed that the presence of collagen type I was mostly around the nucleus. Type III collagen was more diffused in the cytoplasm. Type V collagen was detected in fibrillar and vesicular forms in the cytoplasm. We conclude that, the high-density culture on FWI is an appropriate method for the production of tenocytes without loosing specialized processes such as the synthesis of different collagen molecules. We consider that the high-density culture system is suitable for in vitro applications which affect tendon biology and will improve our understanding of the biological behavior of tenocytes in view of adequate matrix structure synthesis. Such high-density cultures may serve as a model system to provide sufficient quantities of tenocytes to prepare tenocyte-polymer constructs for tissue engineering applications in tendon repair...|$|E

For each biological replicate two technical replicates were investigated using a MoFlo cell sorter (Beckman-Coulter, USA) as described before (Jahn et al. [2013]; Jehmlich et al. [2010]). Forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter signals (SSC) were acquired using blue laser excitation (488  nm, 400  mW) and a bandpass filter of 488 / 10  nm {{together with a}} neutral density filter of 2.0 for emission. The DAPI fluorescence was recorded using a multi-line UV laser for excitation (333 – 365  nm, 100  mW) and a bandpass filter of 450 [*]±[*] 30  nm for emission. The datasets were annotated according to the miFlowCyt standard (Lee et al. [2008]) and are publicly available on the FlowRepository database (Spidlen et al. [2012]). Cells were sorted at the most accurate mode (single cell, one drop) with a sorting speed of 4, 000  s− 1 and a sample chamber cooled to 4 °C. For cell sorting a total number of 5 [*]×[*] 106 cells per replicate were directly sorted on a <b>filter</b> <b>well</b> plate (LoProdyne™ membrane with 0.45  μm pore size, Nunc, Germany) and the residual buffer was constantly drawn off by an exhaust pump.

40|$|Synthesis of {{pulmonary}} surfactant (PS) {{is necessary for}} normal functioning of the lungs and its production is indicative of normal differentiated lung. The human alveolar carcinoma, A 549, {{has been found to}} synthesis and secrete PS in vitro. The {{purpose of this study was}} to optimise the culture conditions for PS synthesis by A 549 as well as to determine the potential role of foetal lung fibroblasts in the induction of PS by glucocorticoids. A 549 cells growing in filter wells produced higher levels of PS in response to steroid, a 5 -fold increase on the <b>filter</b> <b>well</b> compared to only a 1. 5 -fold increase when the cells were cultured on a conventional plastic substrate. A 549 cells grown in filter wells responded to coculture with fibroblasts whether in direct contact or separated co-culture. A 20 -fold increase in PS over control values was observed in separated steroid-treated co-cultures, suggesting the presence of a diffusible factor. A partially purified factor was isolated from fibroblast conditioned medium which was capable of inducing differentiation and other phenotypic changes in A 549, namely induction of PS, reduction of plasminogen activator activity and reduction in the in vivo growth of A 549 xenografts in nude mice. These results suggest that, under the correct conditions, A 549 cells, although transformed, still retain the capacity to respond to differentiation-inducing signals from normal fibroblasts...|$|E

Our results have shown that besides the dominant Pseudomonas Gram-negative genera were Flavimonas, Flavobacterium, Mycoplana, Sinorhizobium, Afipia, Variovorax, Sphingomonas whereas the Gram-positive ones were Streptomyces, Rhodococcus, and Microbacterium. The bacteria isolated were able to utilize such sugars and amino acids as only carbon sources, which have been proved to be among extracellular products of diatoms. Thus it can be supposed that association between diatoms and bacteria is also based upon metabolic interactions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} microfabrication of a coaxial dual model filter for applications in LMDS systems. The coaxial structure is formed by five conductive layers, {{each of which is}} of 700 µm thickness. The filter uses an air filled coaxial transmission line. It is compact with low dispersion and low loss. The design has been extensively tested using a prototype filter micromachined using laser drilling on a copper sheet and the results show a good agreement with the theoretical calculations. The laser fabrication has exposed weakness in suitability to volume production, uneven edges and oxide residuals on the edges, which affects the filter performance. A process for fabrication of such a filter in SU- 8 has been developed which is based on a UV lithographical process. In order to fabricate such thick SU- 8 layers, the SU- 8 process has been optimized in terms of UV radiation and post exposure baking. During the test fabrication, the optimized SU- 8 process has produced microstructures with an aspect ratio of 40 : 1 and a sidewall of 90 ± 0. 1 ◦. The high quality SU- 8 structures can be then either coated with a conductive metal or used as moulds for producing copper structures using an electroforming process. The microfabrication process presented in this paper suits the proposed <b>filter</b> <b>well.</b> It also reveals a good potential for volume production of high quality RF devices.
