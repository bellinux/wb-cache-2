2500|$|The ABO gene locus {{expressing the}} glycosyltransferases has three main allelic forms: A, B, and O.

In case of O allele the exon 6 contains a deletion {{that results in}} a loss of enzymatic activity. The O allele differs slightly from the A allele by deletion of a single nucleotide - Guanine at position 261. The deletion causes a frameshift and results in translation of an almost entirely different protein that lacks enzymatic activity.

5000|$|An {{important}} {{example of}} oligosaccharide cell recognition {{is the role}} of glycolipids in determining blood types. The various blood types are distinguished by the glycan modification present on the surface of blood cells. These can be visualized using mass spectrometry. The oligosaccharides found on the A, B, and <b>H</b> <b>antigen</b> occur on the non-reducing ends of the oligosaccharide. The <b>H</b> <b>antigen</b> (which indicates an O blood type) serves as a precursor for the A and B antigen. Therefore, a person with A blood type will have the A antigen and <b>H</b> <b>antigen</b> present on the glycolipids of the red blood cell plasma membrane. A person with B blood type will have the B and <b>H</b> <b>antigen</b> present. A person with AB blood type will have A, B, and H antigens present.

40|$|T-cell {{immunotherapy}} that targets minor histocompatibility (<b>H)</b> <b>antigens</b> presented selectively by recipient hematopoietic cells, including leukemia, {{could prevent}} and treat leukemic relapse after hematopoietic cell transplantation without causing graft-versus-host disease. To provide immunotherapy {{that can be}} applied to a majority of transplantation recipients, it is necessary to identify leukemia-associated minor <b>H</b> <b>antigens</b> that result from gene polymorphisms that are balanced in the population and presented by common human leukocyte antigen alleles. Current approaches for deriving minor H antigen–specific T cells, which provide essential reagents for the molecular identification and characterization of the polymorphic genes that encode the antigens, rely on in vivo priming and are often unsuccessful. We show that minor H antigen–specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors are found predominantly in the naive CD 8 + T-cell subset and provide an efficient strategy for in vitro priming of native T cells to generate T cells to a broad diversity of minor <b>H</b> <b>antigens</b> presented with common human leukocyte antigen alleles.

50|$|The {{specificity}} of the <b>H</b> <b>antigen</b> {{is determined by}} the sequence of oligosaccharides. More specifically, the minimum requirement for H antigenicity is the terminal disaccharide Fucose-Galactose, where the fucose has an alpha(1-2)linkage. This antigen is produced by a specific fucosyl transferase that catalyzes the final step in the synthesis of the molecule. Depending upon a person's ABO blood type, the <b>H</b> <b>antigen</b> is converted into either the A antigen, B antigen, or both. If a person has group O blood, the <b>H</b> <b>antigen</b> remains unmodified. Therefore, the <b>H</b> <b>antigen</b> is present more in blood type O and less in blood type AB.Two regions of the genome encode two enzymes with very similar substrate specificities: the H locus (FUT1) which encodes the Fucosyl transferase and the Se locus (FUT2) that instead indirectly encodes a soluble form of the <b>H</b> <b>antigen,</b> which is found in bodily secretions. Both genes are on chromosome 19 at q.13.3. - FUT1 and FUT2 are tightly linked, being only 35 kb apart. Because they are highly homologous, they are likely to have been the result of a gene duplication of a common gene ancestor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Salmonella are {{frequently}} isolated from chickens and their products. Prevalent serogroups and serovars of Salmonella {{as well as}} their genotypes and antibiograms were determined for cloacal samples from 1595 chickens. To understand the possible serovar and <b>H</b> <b>antigens</b> for transmission between chicken and human, serovars and their <b>H</b> <b>antigens</b> of 164 chicken and 5314 human isolates were compared. Results Prevalence of Salmonella differed among chicken lines and ages. Chicken and human isolates belonged mainly to serogroup B, C 1, C 2 -C 3, D, and E. 13 serovars and 66 serovars were identified for chicken and human isolates respectively. The common serovars for chicken and human isolates were S. Typhimurium, S. Enteritidis, S. Albany, S. Derby, and S. Anatum and shared common <b>H</b> 1 <b>antigens</b> "g complex; i; e,h; and z 4,z 24 " and <b>H</b> 2 <b>antigens</b> " 1 complex and -". In human isolates, <b>H</b> 1 <b>antigen</b> "i" and <b>H</b> 2 <b>antigen</b> "-" were common in all serogroups. In chicken, antimicrobial susceptibility differed among serogroups, serovars and three counties. All isolates were susceptible to cefazolin and ceftriaxone, but highly resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, flumequine, streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and tetracycline. Except those isolates of serogroup C 1 of Chick group and serogroup G, all isolates were multi-drug resistance. Only S. Kubacha, S. Typhimurium, S. Grampian, and S. Mons were resistant to ciprofloxacin and/or enrofloxacin. Conclusion In chicken, prevalent serogroups and serovars were associated with chicken ages, lines and regions; and flouroquinolone-resistant and MDR isolates emerged. <b>H</b> 1 <b>antigens</b> "g complex and i" and <b>H</b> 2 <b>antigens</b> " 1 complex and -" might be important for transmission of Salmonella between chicken and human. </p...|$|R

50|$|The ABO gene resides on {{chromosome}} 9 at {{the band}} 9q34.2 and contains 7 exons. The ABO locus encodes three alleles. The A allele produces α-1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase (A-transferase), which catalyzes {{the transfer of}} GalNAc residues from the UDP-GalNAc donor nucleotide to the Gal residues of the acceptor <b>H</b> <b>antigen,</b> converting the <b>H</b> <b>antigen</b> into A antigen in A and AB individuals. The B allele encodes α-1,3-galactosyl transferase (B-transferase), which catalyzes the transfer of Gal residues from the UDP-Gal donor nucleotide to the Gal residues of the acceptor H-antigen, converting the <b>H</b> <b>antigen</b> into B antigen in B and AB individuals. Remarkably, {{the difference between the}} A and B glycosyltransferase enzymes is only four amino acids. The O allele lacks both enzymatic activities because of the frame shift caused by a deletion of guanine-258 in the gene which corresponds to a region near the N-terminus of the protein.This results in a frameshift and translation of an almost entirely different protein. This mutation results in a protein unable to modify oligosaccharides which end in fucose linked to galactose. Thus no A or B antigen is found in O individuals.

If both copies of FUT1 are inactive (h/h), the Bombay phenotype results. The classical Bombay phenotype is caused by a Tyr316Ter mutation in the coding region of FUT1.

In Caucasians, the Bombay phenotype may be caused by a number of mutations. Likewise, a number of mutations have been reported to underlie the para-Bombay phenotype.
