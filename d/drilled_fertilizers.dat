40|$|Soil {{management}} measures {{that increase the}} efficiency of organic matter cycling and maintain favorable soil structure are needed for improving soil quality. On the other hand, soil structure degradation due to inadequate soil management systems is widespread. Among the indicators of soil physical quality, saturated hydraulic conductivity and penetration resistance {{are thought to be}} sensitive to soil management system. The aim of this work was to study the influence of soil tillage system and organic fertilization on selected soil physical properties after the first year of treatment. The field work was conducted in Selviria, MS, Brazil on an Oxisol. The experimental design was randomized complete blocks with split-plots, with 12 treatments and 4 repetitions. Tillage treatments included conventional ploughing (CT) and direct <b>drilling</b> (DD). <b>Fertilizer</b> treatments were: 1) manure, 2) manure plus mineral, 3) traditional mineral 4) plant residues of Crotalaria juncea, 5) plant residues of Pennisetum americanum and 6) control plot. The plots were cropped to bean in winter and to cotton in summer, and both cultures were irrigated. After one year no significant differences between treatments in mechanical resistance and porosity were found. However, saturated hydraulic conductivity and infiltration were higher in the conventional tillage treatment at the 0. 00 - 0. 10 m depth. Moreover, an improvement in soil physical condition by organic fertilizers was shown...|$|R
40|$|A {{hand-operated}} {{machine that}} buries fertilizer some 5 cm {{below the surface}} of rice paddies should enable a farmer to halve his fertilizer costs yet still maintain his yield levels. Spreading fertilizer in the conventional way on paddies is very wasteful, as only about one-third reaches the crop. Consequently, rice farmers have not made full use of fertilizer to boost their yields In 1982 engineers at the Inter' national Rice Research Institute (IRRI) began a project to develop a machine that would place the fertilizer into the soil and so avoid wastage. Laboratory experiments have shown that once fertilizer is placed in deep furrows these have to be closed quickly otherwise much of the fertilizer will be lost. Other tests have shown that, up to a depth of 10 cm, the deeper the fertilizer is placed the better. But getting it down to that depth is hard work, so the engineers compromised and aimed at a depth of 4 to 5 cm. Many machines were designed and tried but IRRI have selected two or three designs which are suited to different soil conditions. The applicator has a small auger that <b>drills</b> the <b>fertilizer</b> into the soil and then closes up the furrow as it moves forward. The auger itself moves up and down, taking its drive from the wheels. There are single, two and four-row machines that can be easily pushed through the paddy either just before or just after transplanting. Using the applicators it is possible {{to increase the amount of}} fertilizer that reaches the crop from 30 % to 50 %, and IRRI researchers expect rice farmers to use up to 50 % less fertilizer to get the same yields. There are now over 100 machines in operation, 50 in the Philippines and the remainder in other Asian countries. So far the machines have been well received by farmers. The next stage is to get local manufacturers to produce the applicators. For further information write to: International Rice Research Institute P.

40|$|As {{the price}} of {{imported}} no-till-drill machines is very high, manufacturing and evaluation of a new machine with appropriate price has been consider in this study. The machine could <b>drill</b> seed and <b>fertilizer</b> in different depths in dry land sandy soil with residue cover. Main parts of manufactured machine, such as chassis, seed and fertilizer tanks, the metering system and press wheels {{were the same as}} that of conventional dry land seeder. Coulter and soil opener, which are important parts of no-till-drill machine, were designed such a way to open a row in untilled soil by one pass of machine through the field. Then seed and fertilizer granules have been planted directly. The optimized dry land seeder was tested for its performance evaluation in the field condition in the basis of the parameters of working depth evenness, intra-row seed spacing uniformity, seed germination percentage, fuel consumption, tractor slippage, total time requirement, and machine field capacity. Experiments were conducted at three levels of soil moisture contents (M 1 = 8 - 10 %, M 2 = 16 - 18 % and M 3 = 23 - 25 %) and at three levels of forward speeds (V 1 = 4 km/h, V 2 = 6 km/h and V 3 = 8 km/h). The above treatments were also compared with conventional method: soil tilling by mould board plow + chisel plow + dry land seeder.

40|$|The {{basic problem}} {{associated}} with no-till and minimum tillage seeding operations {{is the presence}} of crop residue on fields which does not get cut with the existing seeding machines. This failure to cut crop residue results in improper placement of seed. Special seeding machines have been designed, (e. g., Haybuster 1206 grain and <b>fertilizer</b> <b>drill)</b> to overcome these problems. These machines re­quire extra investment for farmers already having conventional seeding machines if they want to practice minimum and no-tilling farming. The study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the perfor­mance of disc coulters under zero-till practice in the soil bin under different soil conditions and to provide design criteria for modification of existing seed drills so that they could be used under no till conditions. Cone index data on soil penetration resistance and soil moisture content were obtained from no-tilled and fall tilled fields at seeding time to simulate field conditions in the soil bin. Three sizes of disc coulters were evaluated for their cutting ability of the crop-residue in the soil bin. The data of cone index of packed soil, its moisture content, straw moisture content and straw density were also measured. Draft and vertical forces on coulters were reported for each test. Observations and analysis of data indicated a varying degree of crop residue being cut by the coulters under different soil conditions. The disc coulter 460 mm diameter performed satisfactorily and cut the straw at densities up to 5000 kg/ha at 50 mm depth of penetration and deeper...|$|R

40|$|Some {{farmers in}} the Inland Pacific Northwest have {{reported}} a lower grain yield of spring cereals with no-till (NT) compared to conservation tillage (CT). A 4 -Y field {{study was conducted in}} a 12 -in annual precipitation zone to determine tillage method and sowing rate effects on seed-zone water, seed-zone temperature, plant stand, grain yield, grain yield components, and straw production for three spring-sown cereal species. Wheat, barley, and oat were sown at 120, 200, and 280 seeds/m 2 (about 44, 72, and 100 lb/ac) in a split plot design with NT and CT as main plots and sowing rate by cereal species combinations as subplots. Factors other than tillage method (i. e., <b>drill,</b> sowing date, <b>fertilizer</b> rate, sowing depth) were held constant. There were no differences in plant stand between NT and CT, but grain yield was reduced by 5 % in NT partly due to less water in the seed zone compared to CT during early plant development. Disruption of capillary continuity with CT appeared to restrict upward movement of water, resulting in greater retention of water in the seed zone underlying the depth of tillage. Grain yield was not affected by the sowing rate for any crop species because increased number of heads per unit area (HPU) and kernels per head (KPH) consistently compensated for reduced plant stand density. With precise seed placement, the sowing rate of spring cereals can be reduced by 50 % or more from rates commonly used.

40|$|Interest {{in various}} forms of reduced tillage is {{steadily}} increasing, in line with today’s high machinery and fuel costs and increasing awareness of harmful effects of soil compaction. Reduced tillage in its various forms does, however, place higher proportions of coarse aggregates and greater quantities of plant residues. In the summer of 1995, the Väderstad Concorde underwent evaluation in field trials. The Väderstad Concorde is essentially a seedbed harrow with a seed hopper installed above it. The seed is fed pneumatically, with each harrow tine functioning as a seed coulter. Depth control is achieved using a wheel which follows the contour of the land, transmitting control signals to the hydraulics unit to raise or lower the machine as required. The Concorde was developed to allow farmers {{to reduce the number}} of machinery passes required. The trails encompassed spring drilling (With different numbers of harrow passes and various drilling depth), and involved studies of the bottom of the drill and the seedbed itself to investigate seed placement, the size distribution of aggregates and the moisture content of the bottom of the drill and the rest of the seedbed. During the growing season there followed monitoring of the number of plants, shoots (tillers) and ears, and of yields. The number of weeds at the various stages of growth was also investigated. Another aspect of these trials involved <b>drilling</b> nitrogen <b>fertilizer</b> amongst growing autumn wheat in the spring (drilled both along and across the direction of seed drilling). In spring drilling, an implement with Crosskill rollers was used after the Concorde. The result showed that seed placement after the Concorde in spring drilling was good, with, at lowest, 96 % of seed placed at the bottom of the drill. The number of plants per square metre after the Concorde was higher where no prior harrowing had taken place. This indicates that harrowing prior to drilling does not improve the result, provided that the field has been harrowed in the autumn or levelled. In the trail crops which had not been harrowed prior to drilling, pressure on the crop from weeds was lower than in the crops which had been harrowed twice before drilling. The harvest result also indicated that a reduced number of harrow passes before drilling with Concorde produced increased yields. Drilling nitrogen fertiliser in autumn wheat produced increased yields when compared with topdressing, in spite of the fact that a great deal of precipitation fell on the following night. It is difficult to determine whether the increased yield was a result of the tillage effect or the placement of the fertiliser. Even greater effects are probably to be expected if rain does not fall on the crop immediately after the fertiliser is drilled in this way...|$|R
40|$|While many {{spring and}} winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) {{varieties}} {{have been evaluated}} for yield characteristics under Utah 2 ̆ 7 s conventional dryland cropping systems, {{little is known about}} these same varieties under new conservation tillage farming management techniques. Farmers are rapidly adopting various reduced tillage systems and need information regarding proper varieties, fertility practices, weed control, etc. A two year field study, in Box Elder County, Utah on a DeJarnet Gravelly silt loam (Loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic, Calcic Pachic Haploxeroll) and on a Mendon silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic, Calcic Pachic Argixeroll) examined total dry matter, grain yield, percent protein, kernel weight, kernel volume, and average bushel weight responses to four fertility treatments superimposed upon five spring wheat and four winter wheat varieties. Also compared were one spring wheat variety 2 ̆ 2 Komar 2 ̆ 2 and one winter wheat variety 2 ̆ 2 Weston 2 ̆ 2 in a conventional verses conservation tillage dryl and c ropping system. Soi 1 moisture and soi 1 temperature (20 em and 10 em, respectively bel ow the soi 1 surface) readings were compared between the conventional and conservation tillage planting systems. The conservation tillage plantings were done with an air-seeding tillage planter and the conventional plantings were done with standard deep-furrow <b>drills.</b> Dry granular <b>fertilizer</b> (27 - 12 - 0 - 4 sulfur) was applied to both deepfurrow and conservation tillage plots with the air-seeder. Rates were 0, 168, 224, 280 kg/ha fertilizer material applied. Significant differences were obtained for all spring wheat varieties. Conservation-tilled 2 ̆ 2 Komar 2 ̆ 2 yielded significant yield increases ove r conventio na l- tilled 2 ̆ 2 Komar 2 ̆ 2. The opposite held true for 2 ̆ 2 Weston 2 ̆ 2, with the conventional-tilled plots yielding a slightly significant increase in grain over conservation-tillage 2 ̆ 2 Weston 2 ̆ 2. No relative difference in soil water or soil temperature were observed in either variety through time. However, at certain growth stages the differences were clearly discernable. Very littl e significant differences were established amoung the winter wheat varieties. Because of heavy infestations of snowmold (Calonectria graminicola) on all winter wheat plots, the true potential yield characteristics of conservation verses conventional tillage remain unproven on these winter wheat varieties...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Corn {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural products withhigh consumption different forms of usage asfood and fodder. Corn yield and its cultivation needs improvement especially in developing countries. In conventional fertilizing methods with centrifuge machines or hand fertilization, parts of the fertilizer lost through volatilization, leaching and weeds absorption. Leaf burning is also reported in this method. Fertilizer placement in bands is a method that does not show these disadvantages and improves fertilizer use efficiency for the crop. Therefore using new machines and new methods for fertilizing the crop,the cultivation area and mean of yield productioncan improved, for example the yield of corn in this research. Material and Methods: This research was conducted in Lak Lak research farm in Asadabad district. Moldboard plowing plus disking was used for bed preparing the seeds anda 4 rows crop planter was used for planting the seeds. For treatments conducting Combination machine that had designed in thisresearch station workshop was used. This machine was able to place Urea fertilizer with different methods (<b>fertilizer</b> <b>drilling</b> in the rills, fertilizer placement in one side and two sides of plants). The variety of corn that used for this experiment was SC 704 with 65000 plants in one hectareas plant density. After soil sampling nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium fertilizers and other fertilizers demands by means of soil testwere determined. Half of the nitrogen was used at planting time from source of urea and the other half was used as top dressing duringgrowth season due to treatments as follow: 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as broad costing 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as broad costing 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as broad costing 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as drilling in the rills 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as drilling in the rills 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as drilling in the rills 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in one side of the plants 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in one side of the plants 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in one side of the plants 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in two sides of the plants 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in two sides of the plants 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in two sides of the plants The treatments were conducted through 7 - 9 leaf bearing stage of corn growth. After harvesting, the mean yield of each plot and other data of plant attributes were collected through growth season and leaf samples were collected for nitrogen analysis. All data were analyzed usingmeans of Duncan's test.
