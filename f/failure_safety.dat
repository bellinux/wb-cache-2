40|$|AbstractA general {{response}} surface(RS) method is presented for reliability analysis of complex structure/mechanism with fuzzy-random uncertainty both in basic variables and in failure state variables. On {{the basis of}} equivalent transformation from fuzzy basic variable to random basic variable, the fuzziness and randomness in the basic variables are considered simultaneously in the presented general RS method. Once the fuzzy basic variables are transformed into the random basic variables, the conventional RS method is employed to establish the general RS for the complex structure/mechanism with implicit limit state equation by finite element numerical simulation. Furthermore, the general failure probability is defined according to the probability formula for fuzzy-random event by taking the fuzziness and randomness in the <b>failure</b> <b>safety</b> state into consideration, and an appropriate fuzzy operator is adopted to calculate the general failure probability for the complex structure/mechanism with multiple implicit failure modes. Finally, a general reliability analysis of an elastic linkage mechanism is introduced to illustrate the present method...|$|E

The design index helps in choosing the most suitable material for any geometry of the truss. Using the design index, both the design space and the material database are searched simultaneously using gradient-based optimization algorithms. The important feature of our approach is that the formulated optimization problem is continuous, although the material selection from a database is an inherently discrete problem.

METHODS: French rheumatologists and internal-medicine practitioners registered on the Club Rhumatismes et Inflammations website were asked to report on patients given tocilizumab (4 or 8 mg/Kg) to treat active disease meeting ASAS criteria for axial or peripheral spondyloarthritis, after anti-TNFalpha treatment <b>failure.</b> <b>Safety</b> and efficacy after 3 and 6 months were assessed retrospectively using standardized questionnaires. RESULTS: Data were obtained for 21 patients, 13 with axial spondyloarthritis (46 % men; median age, 42 years; disease duration, 11 years; HLA B 27 -positive, 92. 3 %) and 8 with peripheral spondyloarthritis (25 % men; median age, 40 years; disease duration, 10 years; HLA B 27 -positive, 62. 5 %). No patients with axial disease had at least 20 mm decrease in BASDAI neither a BASDAI 50 response or major ASDAS improvements after 3 or 6 months; an ASDAS clinically important improvement was noted at month- 3 in 5 of 13 patients and at month- 6 in 1 of 4 patients. A good DAS 28 response was achieved in 4 patients with peripheral disease, including 1 in EULAR remission at month- 3. At month- 6, 4 patients were still taking tocilizumab including 1 in EULAR remission and 1 with a good DAS 28 response. Tocilizumab was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. Initially elevated acute-phase reactants declined during tocilizumab therapy.

40|$|Mainstream {{object-oriented}} languages {{include a}} null value that inhabits every object type and that pervades programs. It exists both because the language semantics requires it in certain places {{and because it}} is the most convenient representation for common patterns, such as for sentinel values indicating <b>failure.</b> <b>Safety</b> requires implementations of these languages to insert run-time checks throughout programs to determine whether object references are null at each field lookup and method call. The ubiquity of null in object-oriented programs leads to severe engineering problems for programmers. First, the error messages issued by the run-time checks are typically not sufficiently informative to help the programmer find the source of the error. Second, the type systems in OO languages generally do not distinguish null from other values of (object) type, preventing the programmer from stating important invariants about the flow of null in the type system. Third, programmers ’ standard use of null as a sentinel does not unambiguously represent failures. To resolve or avoid these ambiguities, component authors must incorporate additional complexity into their interfaces, and this complexity can lead to subtle bugs. In this dissertation, we propose two changes to Java that allow us to completely remove the null value. Doing so addresses the problems above and provides significant engineering benefits to the programmer. Further, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of our proposal with a migration path that allows programmers to shift large codebases from Java to our new language, one class at a time.

METHODS This article {{is part of the}} Pesquisa Nacional sobre Acesso, Utilização e Promoção do Uso Racional de Medicamentos – Serviços (National Survey on Access, Use and Promotion of Rational Use of Medicines – Services) –, a cross-sectional and exploratory study, of evaluative nature, consisting of an information survey within a representative sample of municipalities, stratified by Brazilian regions, which constitute the study domains, and a sample of Primary Health Care services. Pharmaceutical services (PS) were directly observed with photographic record and face-to-face interviews with those responsible for the dispensing of medicines and over the telephone with those responsible for pharmaceutical services. Data were processed with the SPSS® software version 21. RESULTS The investigated dimensions showed relevant deficiencies and inequalities between the regions, generally more favorable in the Southeast and Midwest regions and weaker in the Northeast and North regions. We verified non-compliance with technical requirements and conditions essential to the conservation of medicines, which may interfere with the maintenance of stability and, thus, on their quality, efficacy, and safety. The regulation of advertising/promotion of medicines is still incipient and there is some progress in the structuring of mechanisms regarding pharmacovigilance.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThere is {{evidence}} that aminoglycosides given in a single daily dose (once daily dose, ODD) are as effective and safe as multiple daily doses (MDD). However, the published pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data are overly representative of pediatric populations in Europe and the USA, and not representative of low or middle-income countries such as Costa Rica, in which the patient population might differ from those in higher income settings. MethodsA double-blind, randomized clinical trial of the efficacy and safety of ODD vs. MDD amikacin therapy was conducted for children aged 2 – 12 years with an intraoperative diagnosis of perforated appendicitis. One hundred patients were randomized following a one-to-one randomization to receive either amikacin 7. 5 mg/kg every 8 h (MDD) or 22. 5 mg/kg as a single dose (ODD). Patients in both groups were given clindamycin 10 mg/kg every 6 h. Efficacy was evaluated by the occurrence of intra-abdominal abscesses, documented by abdominal ultrasound, and therapeutic <b>failure.</b> <b>Safety</b> {{was determined by the}} presence of renal or cochlear toxicity. ResultsFifty patients were enrolled in each group. There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of intra-abdominal abscesses or therapeutic failures, or in the occurrence of cochlear or renal toxicity, between the MDD and ODD treatment groups. ConclusionsIn this patient population of Costa Rican children with perforated appendicitis, we found that amikacin ODD is as safe and effective as the MDD regimen. This could have implications for national health systems such as that in Costa Rica, as ODD is presumably a more economic option and may reduce the cost of antibiotic treatment in patients with perforated appendicitis. This would need to be confirmed through an economic analysis, which is outside the purview of this paper...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) systems present an elegant solution to many {{problems associated with}} high-speed machinery design and operation. However, AMBs are deficient in that it allows only for contact-free suspension of rotors. Conventional rolling bearings, named backup bearings, are usually installed between the {{magnetic bearing}}s and the rotor {{in order to avoid}} machine damage in the case of suspension failure. Given the critical function fulfilled by backup bearings with respect to system safety, adequacy assessment of these bearings is vital. However, literature on the subject reveals that no established procedures exist in this regard. This need is addressed in the present study by creating computer simulation models which are capable of predicting backup bearing loads during delevitation. This provides a basis on which stress-related <b>failure</b> <b>safety</b> of the backup bearings may be evaluated. The first simulation model which is developed assumes planar dynamics of the rotor and other components. Development of this model mainly serves to resolve computer implementation issues which are relevant to the intended full model. Following development of the first model, a more detailed model is created by major expansion and modification of the developed code. The detailed model accounts for all major effects present during rotor delevitation. These include a rigid rotor model capable of accounting for three-dimensional unconstrained motion, a model of rotor-bearing contact stiffness and a model of the bearing mount stiffness. In order to ensure accurate computer implementation of the models, both are extensively verified by testing against manually obtainable solutions. Following verification, the models are also subjected to a validation process to ascertain {{the extent to which the}} models are representative of real-world behaviour. This is done by comparison of model predictions with experimental observations of a practical AMB system. Many unforeseen problems are encountered during the validation process, hindering detailed validation of the models. Notwithstanding these problems, valuable lessons are learnt which can contribute significantly to improvement of future validation attempts—a greatly lacking aspect of research in the field of rotor delevitation analysis.

40|$|The brittle <b>failure</b> <b>safety</b> of reactor {{pressure}} vessels (RPV) {{has to be}} demonstrated for all load cases. According to the ASME code and the German KTA standard the crack driving force for defined crack postulates has to {{be compared with the}} fracture toughness of the RPV material. Depending on crack size and local stress strain condition the material in the component behaves quite different than the material characterized in standard fracture mechanics tests. Due to the lower constraint in the component, the brittle failure assessment based on these standards can be very conservative. For consideration of the constraint conditions in the component the deterministic quantities as the T-stress or the Q-parameter are often applied. But they consider neither the volume of material under high loading nor the out-ofplane stress state ahead of the postulated crack nor the effect of transient loading. These difficulties can be overcome using local approach models based on the weakest link principle in which the failure probability can be described by quantities based on the local stress state and the affected volume. In order to demonstrate the effect of transient loading on the loss of constraint and to validate the local approach model experiments on bend specimens with shallow cracks under transient loading have been performed. These tests show an enormous shift of the master curve reference temperature of - 100 °C compared to the reference temperature from C(T) tests. This shift is caused by the shallow crack effect and even more by the effect of the transient loading. For the assessment of different flaw postulates in the leading location of the RPV the loss of constraint was quantified using the classical Beremin model as well as the enhanced model developed at Fraunhofer IWM. For flaw postulates in the ferritic nozzle corner with flaw depths up to 75 mm (quarter of wall thickness acc. to ASME Code) and with the assumption of broken clad a considerable loss of constraint was determined. In addition, for flaw postulates under the intact cladding the loss of constraint is remarkably higher than with cladding postulated as broken. In summary, with the measured material toughness and the significant loss of constraint a considerablemargin against brittle failure can be demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Roads {{represent}} a major long-term infrastructure investment. A well-managed and maintained road is therefore {{fundamental to the}} safety and availability of the road network as a whole. In carrying out pavement maintenance functions, Local Road Authorities face growing pressures arising from inadequate budgets and greater accountability, when many of the existing roads have reached the upper limits of their design life spans while being subjected to increasing traffic. There are many factors that influence the decision making process in pavement maintenance management, including road surface conditions, safety, traffic loading, cost, funding and prioritisation decisions, hence an efficient approach is vital to ensure optimisation and a satisfactory trade-off between conflicting factors. A Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach is used to handle the trade-off between conflicting factors. It is processed in the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) using Excel software, and the database developed in Excel is then imported into GIS {{in order to allow}} ease of query, analysis and visualisation of results. The main key output of this research will be the development of a GIS-based pavement maintenance management model to support decision making in pavement maintenance management. The most important factors influencing decision making in pavement maintenance management are established through a nationwide questionnaire survey, which is undertaken among the UK Local Authorities’ pavement maintenance experts. 14 factors were identified, which are: Remaining Service Life, Road Condition Indicator (RCI), Type of Deterioration, Observed Deterioration Rate, Traffic Diversion, Importance of Road/Classification, Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT), Possible Conflict or Overlap with Other Road Works, Risk of <b>failure,</b> <b>Safety</b> Concern, Accident Rate (related to surface condition), Scheme Cost, Available Budget/Funding and Whole Life-Cycle Cost. Interviews were also conducted with experts in pavement maintenance within different Local Road Authorities to justify the rated factors affecting pavement maintenance prioritisation. The case study approach was adopted, based on Runnymede District roads within the Surrey County Council, for developing and testing the GIS-based decision support model. The output model was validated through interviews with four experts in pavement maintenance as target end-users, and the model was judged as a rational, simple and usable appropriate tool for network analysis as GIS.

40|$|International audienceLandslide hazard {{assessment}} is {{the estimation of}} a target area where landslides of a particular type, volume, runout and intensity may occur within a given period. The first step to analyze landslide hazard consists in assessing the spatial and temporal failure probability (when the information is available, i. e. susceptibility assessment). Two types of approach are generally recommended to achieve this goal: (i) qualitative approach (i. e. inventory based methods and knowledge data driven methods) and (ii) quantitative approach (i. e. data-driven methods or deterministic physically based methods). Among quantitative approaches, deterministic physically based methods (PBM) are generally used at local and/or site-specific scales (1 : 5, 000 - 1 : 25, 000 and > 1 : 5, 000, respectively). The main advantage of these methods is the calculation of probability of <b>failure</b> (<b>safety</b> factor) following some specific environmental conditions. For some models {{it is possible to}} integrate the land-uses and climatic change. At the opposite, major drawbacks are the large amounts of reliable and detailed data (especially materials type, their thickness and the geotechnical parameters heterogeneity over a large area) and the fact that only shallow landslides are taking into account. This is why they are often used at site-specific scales (> 1 : 5, 000). Thus, to take into account (i) materials' heterogeneity, (ii) spatial variation of physical parameters, (iii) different landslide types, the French Geological Survey (i. e. BRGM) has developed a physically based model (PBM) implemented in a GIS environment. This PBM couples a global hydrological model (GARDENIA ®) including a transient unsaturated/saturated hydrological component with a physically based model computing the stability of slopes (ALICE ®, Assessment of Landslides Induced by Climatic Events) based on the Morgenstern-Price method for any slip surface. The variability of mechanical parameters is handled by Monte Carlo approach. The probability to obtain a safety factor below 1 represents the probability of occurrence of a landslide for a given triggering event. The dispersion of the distribution gives the uncertainty of the result. Finally, a map is created, displaying a probability of occurrence for each computing cell of the studied area. In order {{to take into account the}} land-uses change, a complementary module integrating the vegetation effects on soil properties has been recently developed. Last years, the model has been applied at different scales for different geomorphological environments: (i) at regional scale (1 : 50, 000 - 1 : 25, 000) in French West Indies and French Polynesian islands (ii) at local scale (i. e. : 10, 000) for two complex mountainous areas; (iii) at the site-specific scale (1 : 2, 000) for one landslide. For each study the 3 D geotechnical model has been adapted. The different studies have allowed : (i) to discuss the different factors included in the model especially the initial 3 D geotechnical models; (ii) to precise the location of probable failure following different hydrological scenarii; (iii) to test the effects of climatic change and land-use on slopes for two cases. In that way, future changes in temperature, precipitation and vegetation cover can be analyzed, permitting to address the impacts of global change on landslides. Finally, results show that it is possible to obtain reliable information about future slope failures at different scale of work for different scenarii with an integrated approach. The final information about landslide susceptibility (i. e. probability of failure) can be integrated in landslide {{hazard assessment}} and could be an essential information source for future land planning. As it has been performed in the ANR Project SAMCO (Society Adaptation for coping with Mountain risks in a global change COntext), this analysis constitutes a first step in the chain for risk assessment for different climate and economical development scenarios, to evaluate the resilience of mountainous areas...|$|E
