40|$|Abstract [...] The paper {{deals with}} the study related to {{integration}} of Flywheel Energy storage system (FESS) to an already available model of parallel hybrid vehicle with pretransmission torque coupling, i. e., replacing the conventional chemical battery with an equivalent mechanical battery. Advantages like high reliability, long cycle life, high energy storage capacity and deep discharge of an FESS can potentially enhance {{the performance of the}} hybrid vehicles. FESS employed for the analysis comprises an integrated flywheel homopolar <b>inductor</b> <b>machine</b> with High-frequency drive. The simulation results of an Electrically Peaking Hybrid (ELPH) are used as a base work in the present analysis. The ELPH model uses a control strategy to optimize the vehicle performance with a major concern for battery performance. The paper analyzes the performance of considered FESS model under the same control strategy and driving conditions. A MATLAB/SIMULINK model is used for the analysis of the vehicle for both urban and highway drives. Finally a comparison is drawn between the performance of the chemical battery, working in its best efficiency range, {{as a result of the}} applied control strategy, to that of the considered FESS. It is inferred from the simulated results that the performance of employed FESS is satisfactory in comparison to chemical batteries. It is therefore expected that FESS can be effectively employed in hybrid vehicles. Index Terms—Hybrid Vehicle, FESS, ELPH Vehicle I...|$|E
40|$|Construction of {{inductor}} contactless electrical {{machine is}} introduced: generator with excitation from permanent magnets with the decreased moment of resistance at starting. Contactless disk-type multipolar generators with excitation from permanent magnets {{are becoming more}} common in small scale wind and hydropower generation now. It is known {{that this type of}} generators have characteristic disadvantages. In particular, these generators have the effect of magnetic freezing. The effect makes the start of rotation of windwheel and its subsequent acceleration to the rate rpm difficult. To eliminate the effect and to improve starting characteristics construction of generator with variable air gap is suggested. Variable air gap’s size is regulated by centrifugal regulator. For this purpose the part of magnetic circuit of rotor is a moving element. Air gap δ has its maximum value at a motionless rotor or low rotation angular frequency. Herewith magnetic linkage is minimal and generator has an insignificant resistive starting torque. With the increasing of angular frequency magnetic system of rotor moves along the axis of rotation by the force caused by centrifugal regulator. In result air gap decreases, magnetic system increases flux linkage and generator starts to produce electric energy. At reduction of angular rotation frequency under the influence of restoring spring magnetic system of a rotor moves to original position. Technical-economical effect comes from the decreasing of resistive torque of the <b>inductor</b> <b>machine</b> shaft, i. e. improvement of starting characteristics. On the construction of the described generator the patent of the Latvian republic is obtained in [1]...|$|E
40|$|Background. Electric {{generators}} of {{wind turbines}} {{must meet the}} following requirements: they must be multi-pole; to have a minimum size and weight; to be non-contact, but controlled; to ensure the maximum possible output voltage when working on the power supply system. Multipole and contactless are relatively simply realized in the synchronous generator with permanent magnet excitation and synchronous inductor generator with electromagnetic excitation; moreover the first one has a disadvantage {{that there is no}} possibility to control the output voltage, and the second one has a low magnetic leakage coefficient with the appropriate consequences. Purpose. To compare machine dimensions and weight of the transformer unit with induction generators and is an opportunity to prove their application for systems with low RMS-growth rotation. Methodology. A new design of the electric <b>inductor</b> <b>machine</b> called in technical literature as machine-transformer unit (MTU) is presented. A ratio for estimated capacity determination of such units is obtained. Results. In a specific example it is shown that estimated power of MTU may exceed the same one for traditional synchronous machines at the same dimensions. The MTU design allows placement of stator coil at some distance from the rotating parts of the machine, namely, in a closed container filled with insulating liquid. This will increase capacity by means of more efficient cooling of coil, as well as to increase the output voltage of the MTU as a generator to a level of 35 kV or more. The recommendations on the certain parameters selection of the MTU stator winding are presented. The formulas for copper cost calculating on the MTU field winding and synchronous salient-pole generator are developed. In a specific example it is shown that such costs in synchronous generator exceed 2. 5 times the similar ones in the MTU...|$|E

40|$|Lately, {{there has}} been {{increased}} interest in hybrid excitation electrical machines. Hybrid excitation is a construction that combines permanent magnet excitation with wound field excitation. Within the general classification, these machines can be classified as modified synchronous <b>machines</b> or <b>inductor</b> <b>machines.</b> These machines may be applied as motors and generators. The complexity of electromagnetic phenomena which occur {{as a result of}} coupling of magnetic fluxes of separate excitation systems with perpendicular magnetic axis is a motivation to formulate various mathematical models of these machines. The presented paper discusses the construction of a unipolar hybrid excitation synchronous machine. The magnetic equivalent circuit model including nonlinear magnetization curves is presented. Based on this model, it is possible to determine the multi-parameter relationships between the induced voltage and magnetomotive force in the excitation winding. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} the analysis of the impact of additional stator and rotor yokes on above relationship. Induced voltage determines the remaining operating parameters of the machine, both in the motor and generator mode of operation. The analysis of chosen correlations results in an identification of the effective control range of electromotive force of the machine...|$|R

40|$|A {{construction}} of a contact-less <b>inductor</b> electric <b>machine</b> with improved starting and regulation characteristics is suggested. Nowadays the multi-pole contact-less generators of disk construction with the permanent magnet excitation are more applied in small hydro- and wind power engineering. Simple construction, small sizes, low angular velocity give an opportunity to install them on same shaft with the turbine without any kind of gear either chain or V-belt gear. The generators of such construction have also some disadvantages. Particularly, they have an effect of "magnetic sealing". This complicates {{the beginning of the}} driving mechanism rotation and further acceleration to the rated number of turns. For the elimination of this effect and improvement of the starting characteristics a {{construction of}} generator is suggested with a variable air gap the value of which is regulated by means of centrifugal regulator. With this purpose a part of magnetic circuit is made movable. With an unmovable rotor and low angular velocity the air gap is of maximum value. The magnetic flux linkage and generator have an insignificant starting resistive torque. With the increasing of angular rotating frequency the magnetic system of the rotor is moving along the rotation axis being influenced by the force of the centrifugal regulator. With this the air gap is decreased, magnetic flux linkage increases and generator starts to recuperate electric energy. With the decreasing of the angular velocity under the influence of return spring the rotor magnetic system returns to the initial state. The centrifugal regulator of the air gap value is a constructive part of the rotor magnetic circuit of the machine...|$|R
40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{investigation}} of variable speed control of a synchronous generator. To achieve controlled variable speed operation, the generator was loaded with a three phase Rectifier and a boost converter. A system as such can be an interesting option for variable speed wind turbine applications. The electrical power quality can be improved while minimizing stresses in the drive chain. The terminal voltage of the generator can be controlled from the duty cycle if the booster output voltage is kept constant. This constant voltage is achieved {{with the help of}} a grid side inverter. As the speed and the terminal voltage are directly related, speed of the generator can thus be controlled for a given torque. In the report, speed control technique of a synchronous machine with a step-up converter is presented. An experimental setup of a 7. 5 kV A machine was prepared. The booster inductance was compensated by the inductance in the machine winding itself, hereby, reducing the cost as well as the I 2 R loss.

40|$|Design {{optimisation}} {{of electromagnetic}} devices is strongly affected by thermal behaviour. In order to check whether thermal limitations are exceeded, {{one has to}} accurately evaluate the loss generated for each working condition and feed it to a thermal model. Using the two models in sequential manner, however, can lead to an error in the loss estimation. Moreover, a proper loss distribution calculation allows for a more precise temperature field computation, allowing for an accurate prediction of the hot-spot temperature. When AC effects are significant, this process becomes more computationally expensive since every single wire {{should be included in}} the model and this inevitably slows the design procedure. In this work a method is presented for model order reduction of coupled 3 D electromagnetic-thermal finite element analysis via homogenisation. The method, applied to an hardware exemplar representative of an open-slot modular stator-winding assembly, is demonstrated to provide very accurate results compared to a fine model where every single conductor is taken into account, but with a significant reduction in simulation time. Extensive experimental validation is also provided. Due to the reduction in computational effort, the method is suitable for improving the design process and reducing the time to market of many electromagnetic devices, including electrical <b>machines,</b> <b>inductors</b> and transformers...|$|R
40|$|A {{more elegant}} method than that {{previously}} {{given for the}} solution of the equations involved in the theory of electrostatic alternators is given, and illustrated by application to an electrostatic alternator of eight inductors and eight carriers, in which each carrier as it comes in front of an inductor is connected to the next following inductor by means of a brush and insulated arm. The method can be extended to the solution of electrostatic alternators of m carriers and m inductors, where each carrier is connected to the inductor next following, also where each carrier is connected by means of brushes properly placed to the pth inductor following. It may also be applied to electrostatic alternators with m inductors and 2 m, 3 m, or 4 m carriers, and to electrostatic alternators of the Wimshurst type. With regard to the eight inductor alternator it is shown that three waves travel around the machine with periods corresponding to the time of 2 revolutions, 1 revolution, and 2 / 3 revolutions.

40|$|International {{audience}} 3 D modeling with numerical software {{or other}} finite element code is usually required {{in order to}} design electrical applications using bulk High Temperature Superconductors such as machines. Several magnetic or electric behaviors can be used to model the superconductor, e. g. A = 0, mur = 0 or more classically an E(J) power law. Unfortunately, 3 D modeling still involves a large amount of memory and, most of the time, an expensive dedicated computer. To overcome these problems, we propose to investigate 3 D modeling using analytical formulae. We developed an exact and fast computer code that is able to calculate the vector potential and the magnetic field of any structure composed of current carrying conductor of rectangular cross section, i. e. rectangular beam or circular arc segment. In addition, we used the critical state model which means that the current density J is equal to +Jc, -Jc or 0 in the superconductor. Some local and global criteria such as magnetic energy have been defined to stop the penetration of the induced currents in the superconductor's cross-section. The global criteria are closer to the physics but their use requires computing surface or volume integrals over the superconducting material which greatly increases the computing time. Finally, the magnetization of a superconducting <b>inductor</b> of a <b>machine</b> is computed with our method and compared with a 3 D numerical software...|$|R
