5|$|Archimedes {{died during}} the Siege of Syracuse {{when he was killed}} by a Roman soldier despite orders that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be harmed. Cicero {{describes}} visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder, which Archimedes had requested to be placed on his tomb, representing his mathematical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not be allowed to live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E

60|$|The letter {{when done}} was very simple, {{but it took}} him some time, and much consideration. <b>Should</b> <b>he</b> or <b>should</b> <b>he</b> not allude to his former loves? It was {{certainly}} much easier to write his letter without any such allusion, and he did so.|$|R
6000|$|He {{wondered}} {{whether they were}} in London; and, if so, what <b>should</b> <b>he</b> do? <b>Should</b> <b>he</b> call, or <b>should</b> <b>he</b> write? He wished he could do something to show to Miss Arundel how much he appreciated her kindness, and how grateful he was. She was a fine creature, and all her errors were noble ones; enthusiasm, energy, devotion to a sublime cause. Errors, but are these errors? Are they not, on the contrary, qualities which should command admiration in any one? and in a woman--and a beautiful woman--more than admiration? ...|$|R
5|$|Daniel Trippett as Romeo, a brave, kind, and {{handsome}} Montague and Juliet's love interest. He knows <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not go near the Capulets, but he loves Juliet. It is {{revealed that he}} would not let anyone kidnap Juliet; this is first revealed in a shipwreck scene, when an octopus hypnotizes and tangles Juliet and challenges Romeo to a duel.|$|E
5|$|Dog expert Cecil Meares {{was going}} to Siberia to select the dogs, and Scott ordered that, while he was there, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> deal with the {{purchase}} of Manchurian ponies. Meares was not an experienced horse-dealer, and the ponies he chose proved mostly of poor quality, and ill-suited to prolonged Antarctic work. Meanwhile, Scott also recruited Bernard Day, from Shackleton's expedition, as his motor expert.|$|E
5|$|In 627, Khosrow sent Shahrbaraz a letter, {{which said}} that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> send his army to Ctesiphon. Shahrbaraz, however, disobeyed, and moved to Asuristan, where {{he set up a}} camp in Ardashir Khurrah. Khosrow then sent Farrukhzad to {{negotiate}} with him. However, Farrukhzad made a secret conspiracy against Khosrow and joined Shahrbaraz.|$|E

5|$|In a {{nationwide}} Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll of 900 registered voters conducted in July 2001, 44 percent of American respondents thought that Condit {{was involved in}} Levy's disappearance and 27 percent felt that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> resign. Fifty-one {{percent of the respondents}} believed that he was acting as if he were guilty; 13 percent felt that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> run again for office. A poll sample taken from Condit's congressional district held a more favorable view of Condit. On March 5, 2002, Condit lost the Democratic primary election for his Congressional seat to his former aide, then-Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, with the Levy controversy being cited as a contributing factor. He was subpoenaed to appear on April 1, 2002, before a District of Columbia grand jury investigating the disappearance. The date was kept a carefully guarded secret to avoid further leaks. Condit left Congress {{at the end of his}} term on January 3, 2003.|$|E
5|$|In his {{development}} of the ontological argument, Leibniz attempted to demonstrate the coherence of a supremely perfect being. C. D. Broad countered that if two characteristics necessary for God's perfection are incompatible with a third, {{the notion of a}} supremely perfect being becomes incoherent. The ontological argument assumes the definition of God purported by classical theism: that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and morally perfect. Kenneth Einar Himma claimed that omniscience and omnipotence may be incompatible: if God is omnipotent, then <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be able to create a being with free will; if he is omniscient, then <b>he</b> <b>should</b> know exactly what such a being will do (which may technically render them without free will). This analysis would render the ontological argument incoherent, as the characteristics required of a maximally great being cannot coexist in one being, thus such a being could not exist.|$|E
5|$|In the sonnet, {{the speaker}} asks {{whether or not}} <b>he</b> <b>should</b> compare his beloved to the summer season, and argues that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> not because the {{comparison}} does not properly express {{the depths of his}} emotion. He also states that his beloved will live on forever through the words of the poem. Scholars have found parallels within the poem to Ovid's Tristia and Amores, both of which have love themes. Sonnet 18 is written in the typical Shakespearean sonnet form, having 14 lines of iambic pentameter ending in a rhymed couplet. Detailed exegeses have revealed several double meanings within the poem, giving it a greater depth of interpretation.|$|E

5|$|Little is {{revealed}} of Quatermass's early life {{during the course}} of the films and television series in which he appears. In The Quatermass Experiment, he at one point despairs that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> have stuck to his original career as a surveyor.|$|E
5|$|Lody's death {{produced}} a low-key {{response from the}} German government. The Admiralstab recommended {{at the end of}} 1914 that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be awarded a posthumous Iron Cross, Second Class, and argued that the recruitment of naval agents would be assisted if espionage could be rewarded with such a prestigious medal. The Kaiser agreed, though not without some reluctance.|$|E
5|$|Lord Commander Mormont gives Jon Snow House Mormont's ancestral Valyrian steel sword Longclaw, {{which was}} {{originally}} meant {{for his son}} Ser Jorah before Jorah's exile, {{as a reward for}} saving his life from the undead ranger.

60|$|And yet, war! War! Just war! Not {{right or}} wrong, but just war itself. <b>Should</b> <b>he</b> join? <b>Should</b> <b>he</b> give himself over to war?

Not because he felt inspired. No. But just--war.|$|R

5|$|Martin {{was born}} in Highbury, London. When he was six, Martin's family {{acquired}} a piano that sparked his interest in music. At eight years of age, Martin persuaded his parents, Henry and Betha Beatrice (nėe Simpson) Martin, that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> take piano lessons, but those ended after only eight lessons because of a disagreement between his mother and the teacher.|$|E
5|$|Musicians {{and critics}} {{vary in their}} {{appraisal}} of Tristano as a musician. Some describe his playing as cold and suggest that his innovations had little impact; others state {{that he was a}} bridge between bebop and later, freer forms of jazz, and assert that he is less appreciated than <b>he</b> <b>should</b> be because commentators found him hard to categorize and because he chose not to commercialize.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{original}} death mask {{was created}} around 6 May, {{although it is}} not clear which doctor created it.
