40|$|Abstract Background In proteomic analysis, MS/MS spectra {{acquired}} by mass spectrometer {{are assigned to}} peptides by database searching algorithms such as SEQUEST. The assignations of peptides to MS/MS spectra by SEQUEST searching algorithm are defined by several scores including Xcorr, ΔCn, Sp, Rsp, matched ion count and so on. <b>Filtering</b> <b>criterion</b> using several above scores is used to isolate correct identifications from random assignments. However, the <b>filtering</b> <b>criterion</b> was not favorably optimized up to now. Results In this study, we implemented a machine learning approach known as predictive genetic algorithm (GA) for the optimization of <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> to maximize the number of identified peptides at fixed false-discovery rate (FDR) for SEQUEST database searching. As the FDR was directly determined by decoy database search scheme, the GA based optimization approach did not require any pre-knowledge {{on the characteristics of}} the data set, which represented significant advantages over statistical approaches such as PeptideProphet. Compared with PeptideProphet, the GA based approach can achieve similar performance in distinguishing true from false assignment with only 1 / 10 of the processing time. Moreover, the GA based approach can be easily extended to process other database search results as it did not rely on any assumption on the data. Conclusion Our results indicated that <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> should be optimized individually for different samples. The new developed software using GA provides a convenient and fast way to create tailored optimal criteria for different proteome samples to improve proteome coverage. </p...|$|R

A code-constrained inverse <b>filter</b> <b>criterion</b> (IFC) -based blind detector for short-code CDMA signals to detect a desired user’s signal was recently presented by Tugnait and Li (July 2001). In PLC CDMA systems, a user signal may be treated as the superposition of several virtual short-code signals. In this paper a novel approach combining the code-constrained IFC and a penalty function is proposed to simultaneously extract all virtual users associated with a given PLC user.

We also discuss that such condition is satisfied if the step is computed by the SQP or Inexact Restoration methods. For SQP we present a general proof of this result that is valid as for the original as for the slanting <b>filter</b> <b>criterion.</b> In order to compare the performance of the general filter algorithm according to the method used to calculate the step and the filter rule regarded, we present numerical experiments performed with problems from CUTEr collection. ...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} two position-velocity-measured (PVM) α- β- γ tracking filters. The first estimates the target acceleration using the measured velocity, and the second, which is proposed {{for the first time}} in this paper, estimates acceleration using the measured position. To quantify the performance of these PVM α- β- γ filters, we analytically derive steady-state errors that assume that the target is moving with constant acceleration or jerk. With these performance indices, the optimal gains of the PVM α- β- γ filters are determined using a minimum-variance <b>filter</b> <b>criterion.</b> The performance of each filter under these optimal gains is then analyzed and compared. Numerical analyses clarify the performance of the PVM α- β- γ filters and verify that their accuracy is better than that of the general position-only-measured α- β- γ filter, even when the variance in velocity measurement noise is comparatively large. We identify the conditions under which the proposed PVM α- β- γ filter outperforms the general α- β- γ filter for different ratios of noise variance in the velocity and position measurements. Finally, numerical simulations verify the effectiveness of the PVM α- β- γ filters for a realistic maneuvering target.|$|E

40|$|Suffusion is {{a process}} in which {{particles}} are removed from pores and transported through the pore constrictions of a solid skeleton. The quantitative analysis of the suffusion process at the particle scale is difficult, because it is not necessarily clear which part of the particles forms the solid skeleton, and which part can be removed. Furthermore, there is the enormous number and various shapes of particles. Therefore, existing computational programs based on DEM often take days to create and to compute a pore model for this problem. This paper presents a new approach based on simple sphere packing with three acceptable assumptions, namely the occurrence of only spherical particles, the assumption of a minimum number of contacts with neighbouring particles, and the substitution of the fraction of small particles of a soil with a non-spherical body. By introduction of the second assumption the calculation speed is significantly improved. Furthermore, three filling types are introduced in the model, which are random, descending and layer-wise. The new approach allows the investigation of the relationship between porosity and probability of suffusion. The contribution will introduce a further understanding on primary fabrics size and point out difficulties in application of <b>filter</b> <b>criterion</b> for suffusion assessment according to the German guideline [MSD, 2005]...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel news {{filtering}} model based on flexible and soft <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> and exploiting a fuzzy hierarchical categorization of news. The filtering module {{is designed to provide}} news professionals and general users with an interactive and personalised tool for news gathering and delivery. It exploits content-based <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> and category-based <b>filtering</b> techniques to deliver to the user a ranked list of either news or clusters of news. In fact, if the user prefers to have a synthetic view of the topics of recent news pushed by the stream, the system filters groups (clusters) of news having homogenous contents, identified automatically by the application of a fuzzy clustering algorithm that organizes the recent news into a fuzzy hierarchy. The filter can be trained explicitly by the user to learn his/her interests as well as implicitly by monitoring his/her interaction with the system. Several <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> can be applied to select and rank news to the users based on the user’s information preferences and presentation preferences. User preferences specify what information (the contents of interest) is relevant to the user, the sources that provide reliable information, and the period of time during which the information remains relevant. Each individual news or cluster of news homogeneous with respect to their content is selected based on a customizable multi criteria decision making approach and ranked based on a combination of criteria specified by the user in his/her presentation preferences. ...|$|R
