5|$|A period 1 {{element is}} one of the {{chemical}} <b>elements</b> in the first row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical <b>elements.</b> The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate periodic (recurring) trends in the chemical behaviour of the <b>elements</b> as their atomic number increases: a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat, meaning that <b>elements</b> with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns. The first period contains fewer <b>elements</b> than any other row in the table, with only two: hydrogen and helium. This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure. In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure, this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital. Period 1 <b>elements</b> obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell. The maximum number of electrons that these <b>elements</b> can accommodate is two, both in the 1s orbital. Therefore, period 1 can have only two <b>elements.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although both {{hydrogen}} and helium are in the s-block, neither of them behaves similarly to other s-block <b>elements.</b> Their behaviour is {{so different from the}} other s-block <b>elements</b> that there is considerable disagreement over where these two <b>elements</b> should be placed in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Although {{europium}} {{is present}} {{in most of the}} minerals containing the other rare <b>elements,</b> due to the difficulties in separating the <b>elements</b> {{it was not until the}} late 1800s that the element was isolated. William Crookes observed the phosphorescent spectra of the rare <b>elements</b> including those eventually assigned to europium.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, an {{absorbing}} <b>element</b> is {{a special}} type of <b>element</b> of a set {{with respect to a}} binary operation on that set. The result of combining an absorbing <b>element</b> with any <b>element</b> of the set is the absorbing <b>element</b> itself. In semigroup theory, the absorbing <b>element</b> is called a zero <b>element</b> because there is no risk of confusion with other notions of zero. In this article the two notions are synonymous. An absorbing <b>element</b> may also be called an annihilating <b>element.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1923, four {{predicted}} <b>elements</b> {{were still}} {{missing from the}} periodic table: 43 (technetium) and 61 (promethium) are radioactive <b>elements</b> and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making <b>elements</b> 75 (rhenium) and 72 (hafnium) the last two unknown non-radioactive <b>elements.</b> Since rhenium was discovered in 1908, hafnium was the last element with stable isotopes to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical <b>Elements,</b> in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the <b>elements</b> were ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the <b>elements</b> and the location of missing <b>elements</b> was done by determining the specific weight of the <b>elements</b> and comparing the chemical and physical properties.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether new <b>elements</b> will {{continue}} {{the pattern of the}} current periodic table as period 8, or require further adaptations or adjustments. Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for <b>elements</b> 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 <b>elements,</b> and 30 additional <b>elements</b> continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas. More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykkö have theorized that these additional <b>elements</b> do not follow the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table. There are currently several competing theoretical models for the placement of the <b>elements</b> of atomic number {{less than or equal to}} 172.|$|E

5|$|Seaborg {{published}} {{several books}} and journal articles {{during his tenure}} at the Atomic Energy Commission. He predicted the existence of <b>elements</b> beyond those on the periodic table, the transactinide series and the superactinide series of undiscovered synthetic <b>elements.</b> While most of these theoretical future <b>elements</b> have extremely short half-lives and thus no expected practical applications, he also hypothesized the existence of stable super-heavy isotopes of certain <b>elements</b> in an island of stability.

5|$|Super-heavy <b>elements</b> such as {{seaborgium}} {{are produced}} by bombarding lighter <b>elements</b> in particle accelerators that induces fusion reactions. Whereas most of the isotopes of seaborgium can be synthesized directly this way, some heavier ones have only been observed as decay products of <b>elements</b> with higher atomic numbers.|$|E
5|$|Supernovae are {{the major}} source of <b>elements</b> heavier than nitrogen. These <b>elements</b> are {{produced}} by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to 34S, by silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium (see Supernova nucleosynthesis) during silicon burning for nuclei between 36Ar and 56Ni, and by rapid captures of neutrons during the supernova's collapse for <b>elements</b> heavier than iron. Nucleosynthesis during silicon burning yields nuclei roughly 1000-100,000 times more abundant than the r-process isotopes heavier than iron. Supernovae are the most likely, although not undisputed, candidate sites for the r-process, which is the rapid capture of neutrons that occurs at high temperature and high density of neutrons. Those reactions produce highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms. The r-process produces about half of all the heavier isotopes of the <b>elements</b> beyond iron, including plutonium and uranium. The only other major competing process for producing <b>elements</b> heavier than iron is the s-process in large, old, red-giant AGB stars, which produces these <b>elements</b> slowly over longer epochs and which cannot produce <b>elements</b> heavier than lead.|$|E

5|$|The natural {{radioactivity}} of thorium and uranium {{made it hard}} to determine what was happening when these <b>elements</b> were bombarded with neutrons but, after correctly eliminating the presence of <b>elements</b> lighter than uranium but heavier than lead, Fermi concluded that they had created new <b>elements,</b> which he called hesperium and ausonium. The chemist Ida Noddack criticised this work, suggesting that some of the experiments could have produced lighter <b>elements</b> than lead rather than new, heavier <b>elements.</b> Her suggestion was not taken seriously at the time because her team had not carried out any experiments with uranium, and its claim to have discovered masurium (technetium) was disputed. At that time, fission was thought to be improbable if not impossible on theoretical grounds. While physicists expected <b>elements</b> with higher atomic numbers to form from neutron bombardment of lighter <b>elements,</b> nobody expected neutrons to have enough energy to split a heavier atom into two light element fragments in the manner that Noddack suggested.|$|E
