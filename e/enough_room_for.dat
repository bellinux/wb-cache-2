5|$|The {{need for}} the second crewman was an obvious problem with the Mk. XII, {{especially}} as few bombers of the era had <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the operator. Working with Henry Braddick, Blackett developed {{a new version of}} the calculator that included aircraft instruments inside the computor, eliminating the {{need for the}} needle-on-needle matching and completely automating the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with RAF Coastal Command, where he continued development of his theories of operational research.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} {{was not an}} easy place to defend without artillery, as the plains made surprise attacks difficult. Except for the convent itself, the terrain did not offer any natural barriers that the patriots could exploit. Nevertheless, the flat terrain was ideal for cavalry manoeuvres, and the distance between the church and the west gully gave <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> a cavalry charge. The royalists, on the other hand, could support their troops with their ships from the river. Without a supporting navy, or local batteries, San Martín had no means to attack the ships. Although the small path allowed them passage to the ships, it could force the royalist forces to bottleneck during a retreat while the long range guns of the ships protected them. San Martín studied the battlefield and readied the plan for the operation during the night, when the grenadiers were hidden inside the convent.|$|E
5|$|When Maximus {{eventually}} {{catches up}} with Rapunzel, Flynn and Pascal, the horse attempts to apprehend Flynn only to be charmed by Rapunzel, who convinces him to leave Flynn alone until they have arrived at their destination while Pascal ensures that the two maintain a healthy relationship. In the kingdom, Flynn, Rapunzel and Pascal embark on a canoe ride to see the floating lights, revealed to be lanterns, up-close, while Maximus is forced to wait ashore as there is not <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> him. In a friendly gesture, Flynn gives him a bag of apples. Realizing that he is {{falling in love with}} Rapunzel, Flynn attempts to hand off the crown he was promised to the Stabbington Brothers, two colleagues of his, only to be kidnapped and handed over to the police. Mistaking this for abandonment, Rapunzel is taken back to the tower by Gothel, who has caught up with them.|$|E

5|$|An elephant's skull is {{resilient}} {{enough to}} withstand the forces generated by the leverage of the tusks and head-to-head collisions. The back of the skull is flattened and spread out, creating arches that protect the brain in every direction. The skull contains air cavities (sinuses) that reduce {{the weight of the}} skull while maintaining overall strength. These cavities give the inside of the skull a honeycomb-like appearance. The cranium is particularly large and provides <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the attachment of muscles to support the entire head. The lower jaw is solid and heavy. Because {{of the size of the}} head, the neck is relatively short to provide better support. Lacking a lacrimal apparatus, the eye relies on the harderian gland to keep it moist. A durable nictitating membrane protects the eye globe. The animal's field of vision is compromised by the location and limited mobility of the eyes. Elephants are considered dichromats and they can see well in dim light but not in bright light. The core body temperature averages , similar to that of a human. Like all mammals, an elephant can raise or lower its temperature a few degrees from the average in response to extreme environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the {{propulsion}} plant, {{which was to be}} built in the Netherlands, was taking shape. Requirements sent out in August 1939 mandated that the ships have eight boiler rooms, four sets of geared turbines, and 180,000shp. After further improvements, Nevesbu and two German firms (Germaniawerft was responsible for the turbines and Deschimag for the boilers) began sketching preliminary plans. These were then incorporated into two different design studies, one by Nevesbu and the other by NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw (IvS). IvS was purportedly a Dutch company linking Dutch and German designers, but in reality functioned as a front company for German interests. Their design was probably based upon a set of plans drawn up by the Ship Construction Office of the German Navy and received in the Netherlands on 31 August. It did not give the propulsion machinery enough space, and it was thought that this design did not provide <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> magazines. Nevertheless, it was taken into discussions with the Dutch, where the 11 July design was merged with it. IvS came out with one further plan on 11 March 1940, the merits of which were discussed with the Dutch in April of that year.|$|E

25|$|On October 17, 2008, Zach is in {{the process}} of looking for Kendall buried under rubble due to a tornado having just struck Pine Valley. He finds Bianca instead, and is {{surprised}} to see that she is pregnant. He later finds an unconscious Kendall. As an ambulance arrives for her, it is stated that there is not <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> Bianca and Zach to ride along to the hospital. There is, however, <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> Zach and Kendall's children to ride in the front seat of the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall's fate.

Zach had agreed to father Bianca's child for the couple, but did not know that she had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor. Zach helps deliver the new child into the world.|$|E
25|$|The body or {{basket of}} the chariot rested {{directly}} on the axle (called beam) connecting the two wheels. There was no suspension, making this an uncomfortable form of transport. At the front and sides of the basket was a semicircular guard about 3ft (1 m) high, to give some protection from enemy attack.

25|$|A further final {{development}} {{based on}} the Minivan was the Bond Family Safety Saloon. Additional side windows were fitted to the rear compartment of the van and two small hammock type seats were added {{either side of the}} rear door facing inwards. With the bench seat of the tourer replacing the single front seat of the van and pickup, this gave <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> two children and two adults.

25|$|Another {{example of}} the Bf 109's {{advanced}} design {{was the use of}} a single, I-beam main spar in the wing, positioned more aft than usual (to give <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> the retracted wheel), thus forming a stiff D-shaped torsion box. Most aircraft of the era used two spars, near the front and rear edges of the wings, but the D-box was much stiffer torsionally, and eliminated the need for the rear spar. The wing profile was the NACA 2R1 14.2 at the root and NACA 2R1 11.35 at the tip, with a thickness to chord ratio of 14.2% at the root and 11.35% at the tip.|$|E

Procedurally fair processes of the type used by Rawls may not leave <b>enough</b> <b>room</b> <b>for</b> judgment, and therefore, reduce the totality of goodness. For example, if two people are found to own an orange, the standard fair procedure is to cut it in two and give half to each. However, if one wants to eat it while the other wants the rind to flavor a cake, cutting it in two is clearly less good than giving the peel to the baker and feeding the core to the eater.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the role of play for early childhood development in Tanzania; a study of selected early childhood centres in Kinondoni district. It applied qualitative approach where descriptive analysis was done. The study involved 42 and 12 parents and teachers respectively; teachers sample was obtained through purposive sampling from six selected early childhood centres and parents sample was obtained through random sampling. Questionnaires, interview and observation methods were used to collect data from the selected sample. The descriptive analysis was done and results showed that 95 % of parents view play as a strong component of early childhood development and 66. 6 % of teachers reported to have play activities like sports day, study tours in their school time table/ calendar. The study further revealed that 84 % of the visited centres have had <b>enough</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> the children to study with only 16 % lacking <b>enough</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>for</b> the children to learn. 50 % of the centres have play grounds and 33 % were staffed with necessary equipment for children play.

It was concluded that the quality of play in early childhood development have far reaching impacts on child’s mental skills, motor skills and social skills development. The study recommended that the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training should put emphasis on all childhood centers to be equipped with enough facilities to encourage children play. Also recommended the study to be conducted across the country to see the status of childhood development centers...|$|R
