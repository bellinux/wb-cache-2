25|$|A {{photomultiplier}} is a phototube whose sensitivity {{is greatly}} increased {{through the use}} of electron multiplication. This works on the principle of secondary emission, whereby a single electron emitted by the photocathode strikes a special sort of anode known as a <b>dynode</b> causing more electrons to be released from that <b>dynode.</b> Those electrons are accelerated toward another <b>dynode</b> at a higher voltage, releasing more secondary electrons; as many as 15 such stages provide a huge amplification. Despite great advances in solid-state photodetectors, the single-photon detection capability of photomultiplier tubes makes this vacuum tube device excel in certain applications. Such a tube can also be used for detection of ionizing radiation {{as an alternative to the}} Geiger–Müller tube (itself not an actual vacuum tube). Historically, the image orthicon TV camera tube widely used in television studios prior to the development of modern CCD arrays also used multistage electron multiplication.|$|E
25|$|By October 1935, Vladimir Zworykin, George Ashmun Morton, and Louis Malter of RCA in Camden, NJ {{submitted}} their manuscript {{describing the}} first comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of a multiple <b>dynode</b> tube — the device later called a photomultiplier — to Proc. IRE. The RCA prototype photomultipliers also used an Ag-O-Cs (silver oxide-caesium) photocathode. They exhibited a peak quantum efficiency of 0.4% at 800 nm.|$|E
25|$|Photomultiplier tubes (photomultipliers or PMTs for short), {{members of}} the class of vacuum tubes, and more {{specifically}} vacuum phototubes, are extremely sensitive detectors of light in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-infrared ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum. These detectors multiply the current produced by incident light by as much as 100 million times (i.e., 160 dB), in multiple <b>dynode</b> stages, enabling (for example) individual photons to be detected when the incident flux of light is low.|$|E

25|$|The {{necessary}} {{distribution of}} voltage along {{the series of}} <b>dynodes</b> is created by a voltage divider chain, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In the example, the photocathode is held at a negative high voltage of order 1000V, while the anode {{is very close to}} ground potential. The capacitors across the final few <b>dynodes</b> act as local reservoirs of charge to help maintain the voltage on the <b>dynodes</b> while electron avalanches propagate through the tube. Many variations of design are used in practice; the design shown is merely illustrative.|$|R

25|$|If {{used in a}} {{location}} with strong magnetic fields, which can curve electron paths, steer the electrons away from the dynodes and cause loss of gain, photomultipliers are usually magnetically shielded by a layer of soft iron or mu-metal. This magnetic shield is often maintained at cathode potential. When this is the case, the external shield must also be electrically insulated {{because of the high}} voltage on it. Photomultipliers with large distances between the photocathode and the first <b>dynode</b> are especially sensitive to magnetic fields.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electron}} multiplier {{consists of a}} number of electrodes called dynodes. Each <b>dynode</b> is held at a more positive potential, by ≈100 Volts, than the preceding one. A primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3eV for [...] "blue" [...] photons, minus the work function of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons. (In Fig. 1, the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray.) [...] The primary electrons move toward the first <b>dynode</b> because they are accelerated by the electric field. They each arrive with ≈100eV kinetic energy imparted by the potential difference. Upon striking the first <b>dynode,</b> more low energy electrons are emitted, and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second <b>dynode.</b> The geometry of the <b>dynode</b> chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage. For example, if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron, and if there are 12 <b>dynode</b> stages, then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 512 ≈ 108 electrons. [...] This last stage is called the anode. This large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable, for example on an oscilloscope, signaling the arrival of the photon(s) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier.|$|E
2500|$|One variant {{called a}} [...] "channel {{electron}} multiplier" [...] {{does not use}} individual dynodes but consists of a curved tube, such as a helix, coated on the inside with material with good secondary emission. One type had a funnel of sorts to capture the secondary electrons. The continuous <b>dynode</b> was resistive, and its ends were connected to enough voltage to create repeated cascades of electrons. The microchannel plate consists of an array of single stage electron multipliers over an image plane; several of these can then be stacked. This can be used, for instance, as an image intensifier in which the discrete channels substitute for focussing.|$|E

5000|$|Photomultipliers are {{typically}} constructed with an evacuated glass housing, containing a photocathode, several dynodes, and an anode. Incident photons strike the photocathode material, {{which is usually}} a thin vapor-deposited conducting layer {{on the inside of}} the entry window of the device.

2500|$|Photomultiplier tubes {{typically}} utilize 1000 to 2000 volts {{to accelerate}} electrons within {{the chain of}} <b>dynodes.</b> (See Figure near top of article.) The most negative voltage {{is connected to the}} cathode, and the most positive voltage is connected to the anode. Negative high-voltage supplies (with the positive terminal grounded) are often preferred, because this configuration enables the photocurrent to be measured at the low voltage side of the circuit for amplification by subsequent electronic circuits operating at low voltage. However, with the photocathode at high voltage, leakage currents sometimes result in unwanted [...] "dark current" [...] pulses that may affect the operation. [...] Voltages are distributed to the <b>dynodes</b> by a resistive voltage divider, although variations such as active designs (with transistors or diodes) are possible. The divider design, which influences frequency response or rise time, can be selected to suit varying applications.

50|$|When an {{ionizing}} particle passes into the scintillator material, atoms are ionized along a track. For charged particles the track is {{the path of}} the particle itself. For gamma rays (uncharged), their energy is converted to an energetic electron via either the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering or pair production. The chemistry of atomic de-excitation in the scintillator produces a multitude of low-energy photons, typically near the blue end of the visible spectrum. The number of such photons is in proportion to the amount of energy deposited by the {{ionizing particle}}. Some portion of these low-energy photons arrive at the photocathode of an attached photomultiplier tube. The photocathode emits at most one electron for each arriving photon by the photoelectric effect. This group of primary electrons is electrostatically accelerated and focused by an electrical potential so that they strike the first <b>dynode</b> of the tube. The impact of a single electron on the <b>dynode</b> releases a number of secondary electrons which are in turn accelerated to strike the second <b>dynode.</b> Each subsequent <b>dynode</b> impact releases further electrons, and so there is a current amplifying effect at each <b>dynode</b> stage. Each stage is at a higher potential than the previous to provide the accelerating field. The resultant output signal at the anode {{is in the form of}} a measurable pulse for each group of photons that arrived at the photocathode, and is passed to the processing electronics. The pulse carries information about the energy of the original incident radiation on the scintillator. The number of such pulses per unit time gives information about the intensity of the radiation. In some applications individual pulses are not counted, but rather only the average current at the anode is used as a measure of radiation intensity.|$|E
50|$|A sharply focused beam of {{electrons}} (a cathode ray) is generated by the electron gun at ground potential and accelerated by the anode (the first <b>dynode</b> of the electron multiplier) around the gun at a high positive voltage (approx. +1500 V). Once it exits the electron gun, its inertia makes the beam {{move away from the}} <b>dynode</b> towards {{the back side of the}} target. At this point the electrons lose speed and get deflected by the horizontal and vertical deflection coils, effectively scanning the target. Thanks to the axial magnetic field of the focusing coil, this deflection is not in a straight line, thus when the electrons reach the target they do so perpendicularly avoiding a sideways component. The target is nearly at ground potential with a small positive charge, thus when the electrons reach the target at low speed they are absorbed without ejecting more electrons. This adds negative charge to the positive charge until the region being scanned reaches some threshold negative charge, at which point the scanning electrons are reflected by the negative potential rather than absorbed (in this process the target recovers the electrons needed for the next scan). These reflected electrons return down the cathode ray tube toward the first <b>dynode</b> of the electron multiplier surrounding the electron gun which is at high potential. The number of reflected electrons is a linear measure of the target's original positive charge, which, in turn, is a measure of brightness.|$|E
