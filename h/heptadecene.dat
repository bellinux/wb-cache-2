40|$|The {{synergetic}} {{interplay between}} {{the removal of}} saturated methyl esters {{and the addition of}} deoxygenated fatty acids on depressing the cloud point temperature of biodiesel was investigated in this study. Canola biodiesel was produced in batch as a standard with a cloud point of 1. 37 +/- 6. 3 °C. Saturated methyl esters were removed from the standard via urea fractionation resulting in a low saturate biodiesel with a cloud point of - 21. 06 +/- 0. 5 °C. <b>Heptadecene</b> was used as a standard for the major products produced from the deoxygenation of saturated fatty acids. <b>Heptadecene</b> was blended in ratios of 1 to 5 wt% in both the standard and low saturate biodiesel. The standard biodiesel blended with <b>heptadecene</b> did not show any statistically significant shift in the mean cloud point over the range. The low saturate biodiesel blended with <b>heptadecene</b> showed statistically significant deviations from the mean at 2, 4, and 5 wt%. A pseudo-eutectic system was observed between <b>heptadecene</b> and low saturate biodiesel with a minimum cloud point of - 25. 16 +/- 2. 5 °C at 2 wt% <b>Heptadecene...</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractHead-space {{volatiles}} of {{the fruit}} pulp and the whole fruits (skin volatiles) were investigated using solid phase micro-extraction (SPME) and GC–MS. The two major compounds in the fruit pulp were β-caryophyllene (91. 3 %) and α-humulene (8. 3 %). Thirty volatiles representing 88. 7 % of the total composition were identified in the head-space of the whole fruits. <b>Heptadecene</b> (16. 1 %); benzyl 4 -methylpentanoate (8. 8 %), benzyl butyrate (6. 7 %), (Z) - 13 -octadecenal (6. 2 %) and cyclo-pentadecane (5. 7 %) were present in levels higher than 5 %. The major alcohol detected in the head-space of the whole intact fruits was (Z) - 3 -decen- 1 -ol (8. 4 %) ...|$|E

Green algae are of great economic importance. Seaweed is consumed fresh or as seasoning in Japan.

Our research, based on solid phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS), has revealed that volatile compounds differ intensely in the four varieties of commercial green algae. Accordingly, 41 major volatile compounds were identified. <b>Heptadecene</b> was the most abundant compound from Okayama (Ulva prolifera), Tokushima (Ulva prolifera), and Ehime prefecture (Ulva linza).

40|$|Raw {{and cooked}} beef and pork loins were {{irradiated}} at 0 or 5 25 kGy. The radiation induced marker compounds, such as hydrocarbons, 2 -alkylcyclobutanones and sulfur volatiles, were determined after 0 and 6 months of frozen storage. Two hydrocarbons [8 -heptadecene (C 17 : 1), 6, 9 - heptadecadiene (C 17 : 2) ] and two 2 -alkylcyclobutanones [2 - dodecylcyclobutanone (DCB), 2 -tetradecylcyclobutanone (TCB) ] were detected only in irradiated raw and cooked meats. Although pre-cooked irradiated meats produced more hydrocarbons and 2 -alkylcyclobutanones than the irradiated cooked ones, {{the amounts of}} individual hydrocarbons and 2 - alkylcyclobutanones, such as 8 -heptadecene, 6, 9 - heptadecadiene, DCB, and TCB, were sufficient enough to detect whether the meat was irradiated or not. Dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide were also detected only in irradiated meats, but dimethyl trisulfide disappeared after 6 months of frozen storage under oxygen-permeable packaging conditions. The results indicated that 8 - <b>heptadecene,</b> 6, 9 -heptadecadiene, DCB, TCB and dimethyl disulfide, {{even though they were}} decreased with storage, could be used as marker compounds for the detection of irradiated beef and pork regardless of cooking under the frozen conditions for 6 months...|$|E

40|$|Hydrocarbons are {{widespread}} in cyanobacteria, and the biochemical synthetic pathways were recently identified. Intracellular fatty alka(e) nes of cyanobacteria {{have been detected}} by liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) coupled to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). However, whether fatty alka(e) nes can be released to cyanobacterial culture media remains to be clarified. This work develops a sensitive method for analyzing the trace level of extracellular hydrocarbons in cyanobacterial culture media by head space solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled to GC/MS. Headspace (HS) extraction mode using polydimethylsiloxane fiber to extract for 30 min at 50 degrees C was employed as the optimal extraction conditions. Five cyanobacterial fatty alka(e) nes analogs including pentadecene (C 15 : 1), pentadecane (C 15 : 0), <b>heptadecene</b> (C 17 : 1), heptadecane (C 17 : 0), nonadecane (C 19 : 0) were analyzed, and the data obtained from HS-SPME-GC/MS method were quantified using internal standard peak area comparisons. Limits of detection (LOD), limits of quantitation (LOQ), linear dynamic range, precisions (RSD) and recovery {{for the analysis of}} extracellular fatty alka(e) nes of cyanobacteria by HS-SPME-GC/MS were evaluated. The LODs limits of detection (S/N = 3) varied from 10 to 21 ng L- 1. The correlation coefficients (r) of the calibration curves ranged from 0. 9873 to 0. 9977 with a linearity from 0. 1 to 50 mu g L- 1. The RSD values were ranging from 7. 8 to 14. 0 % and from 4. 0 to 8. 8 % at 1. 0 mu g L- 1 and 10. 0 mu g L- 1 standard solutions, respectively. Comparative analysis of extracellular fatty alka(e) nes in the culture media of model cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 demonstrated that sensitivity of HS-SPME-GC/MS method was significantly higher than LLE method. Finally, we found that heptadecane can be released into the culture media of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 at the later growth period. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Supported Pd nanocatalysts were {{prepared}} by deposition of Pd nanoparticles (NPs) onto spherical mesoporous carbon beads (MB) functionalized by heating or acidic treatement (namely commercial MB, MB- 1500 for heating treatment and MB-H 2 O 2 for acidic one). The Pd NPs were synthesized by decomposition of [Pd 2 (dba) 3] (dba: dibenzylideneacetone) under dihydrogen either {{directly on the}} carbon supports without stabilizer leading to naked Pd NPs (Pd/MB series) or in solution {{in the presence of}} a polymer (PVP) or triphenylphosphine (TPP) as a stabilizer to obtain stable colloidal solutions that were further used to impregnate the carbon materials to have carbon-deposited Pd NPs (respectively Pd/PVP/H 2 and Pd/TPP/H 2). The so-obtained nanocatalysts displayed a Pd loading from 0. 5 to 14. 8 wt% and were characterized by different techniques (nitrogen physisorption at 77 K, H 2 -chemissorption and TPD, XRD, XPS and HRTEM). Their catalytic performance in deoxygenation of oleic acid was evaluated in batch and flow reaction conditions. Under batch conditions, it appeared that the extent of the reaction depended on the Pd loading, Pd dispersion on the MB supports and on Pd reduction state showing an influence of the support and the preparation of the catalyst. No aromatic compounds were detected as side products, but in the case of the Pd/MB series, octadecanol and octadecane were formed in large extents indicating a deoxygenation mechanism in which the hydrocarbons were produced via both decarbonylation/decarboxylation and dehydration. However, dehydration was detected only with Pd/MB catalyst containing naked Pd NPs, where cooperation between the Pd metal and oxidic support functional groups is possible, while on the Pd/TPP and Pd/PVP series, i. e. the catalysts exposing small Pd NPs, the decarbonylation/decarboxylation was the only deoxygenation route. Under flow conditions, except for the Pd/MB series, the conversion of stearic acid was superior for all the catalysts compared to batch conditions. The maximum in performance was achieved after only 0. 5 h. Afterwards, the yields in heptadecane suffered a severe decrease up to 3 h reaction time. However, at that time, stopping the feeding of the reactor with oleic acid and flushing the catalyst only with mesitylene allowed to recover the activity and the selectivity of the catalysts. Further experiments carried out in mixtures of H 2 /N 2 or in pure N 2 highlighted the strong role of dihydrogen ratios. Working with a 2. 5 : 1 N 2 /H 2 mixture is crossing out the dehydration route and even no traces of octadecanol nor octadecane have been detected. Then, complete removal of H 2 gave <b>heptadecene</b> in a high excess compared to heptadecane (almost 7 to 1) thus suggesting the decarbonylation/decarboxylation steps as the main route. ICP-OES measurements indicated no leaching of palladium and simple washing of catalysts with mesitylene allowed recycling without any change in conversion or product distribution. Noteworthy, mesitylene as solvent was completely recovered in the reaction products and exhibited no effect in this reaction...|$|E
