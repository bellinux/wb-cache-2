[...] In 2011, in {{response}} to LaBeouf's comments, Harrison Ford said: [...] "I think I told [...] he was a fucking idiot ... As an actor, I think it's my obligation to support the film without making a complete ass of myself. Shia is ambitious, attentive and talented — and he's learning how to deal with a situation which is very unique and difficult." [...] LaBeouf later regretted his comments and their effect on his relationship with Spielberg: [...] "He told me there's a time to be a human being and have an opinion, and there's a time to sell cars. It brought me freedom, but it also killed my spirits because this was a dude <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> like a sensei." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Joe A. Guerra Laredo Public Library {{was first}} housed {{on the second}} floor of the City Hall, now known as the Market Hall, in 1916. In 1974, the Laredo Public Library moved to the {{historic}} Bruni Plaza in downtown Laredo. In 1993, the citizens of Laredo approved the construction of a new main library at McPherson and Calton roads, which opened on February 1, 1998. On July 22, 2016, the structure was named in honor of Joe A. Guerra, a former member of the Laredo City Council known for his support for the library and a personal passion for reading. Council member Roque Vela, who first proposed that the structure be named for Guerra, described the former councilman, who died in 2010, as [...] "someone <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> for his unwavering commitment to public service. I am especially proud to know that the library and reading were passions of Mr. Guerra." [...] The Laredo Public Library, which still uses the Dewey Decimal Classification system, [...] has a [...] main library and two branches. The main library is located in central Laredo; the Bruni Plaza Branch is located downtown east of Washington Street, and the Santo Niño Branch is located in south Laredo.|$|E

He described {{in an interview}} with Steve Lobel, [...] "Jay was a mentor before I ever signed to him." [...] "I studied his moves that much...I got to go on tour with him and steal a lot of gems. That's how you supposed to do it. You're supposed to learn and take pieces from the greatest. So, Jay was my mentor before I ever signed to him. And now that I signed to him it's just a blessing to be able to hit him for advice and get that real 20 years of experience or however long he been in the game. It's priceless.""My favorite rapper was Pac," [...] he said. [...] "He was my favorite rapper before I even started rapping. Before I even thought of-It went from Michael Jackson, Bobby Brown as a kid and artists like that. Even Kool Moe Dee. Just the cool dude that <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to.</b> And then one day my stepfather came home from-I don't know if he was back from Desert Storm...I remember him coming home with that first Pac album. With [...] "Brenda's Got A Baby". It was 2Pacalypse Now. And since then-When I was too young to know what he was talking about, but it connected. Cause that's the thing about art. It's just truth. It's straight-Whatever you feel. So, even as a seven-year-old kid, eight-year-old kid I could hear Pac's early albums and feel the truth." [...] Cole drew comparisons to Nas following the release of Friday Night Lights, stating that Nas served as the primary inspiration behind the creation of the mixtape. Cole later addressed their musical similarities on [...] "Let Nas Down", a song written and composed due to his disparaging comments towards [...] "Work Out".|$|E

2500|$|Vedder was a {{close friend}} of late Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman, Chris Cornell. Cornell {{was one of the first}} people Vedder met outside his Pearl Jam bandmates after moving to Seattle in 1990. The two were neighbors for a while and had shared vocal duties in Temple of The Dog. Soundgarden manager Susan Silver {{recalled}} in the 2009 book Grunge Is Dead: The Oral History of Seattle Rock Music, that Cornell walked Vedder onstage at Pearl Jam (then named Mookie Blaylock)'s second show in Seattle, [...] "Alice in Chains filmed the show at Moore theatre in 1990 and that was the show this new band [...] opened for them. Everyone was still reeling from Andy ’s death... and they hadn’t really played out yet. The band came on and Chris carried Eddie onto the stage – he was on his shoulders. It was one of those super powerful moments, where it was all a big healing for everybody. He came out as this guy who had all the credibility in the world – in terms of people in Seattle – and Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone were loved bands. Andy was such an endearing personality. It was a hard thing to do – to show up after people die. And Chris bringing Eddie out, and pointing at him, as much to say, ‘This is your guy now’. Pearl Jam lead guitarist Mike McCready said about their friendship; [...] "Ed was from San Diego and he felt very intimidated in Seattle. Chris really welcomed him. Ed was super, super shy. Chris took him out for beers and told him stories. He was like, [...] "Hey, welcome to Seattle. I love Jeff [...] and Stone [...] I give you my blessing." [...] From then on he was more relaxed. It was one of the coolest things I saw Chris do.". In a 2009 interview with Uncut magazine, Vedder stated that Cornell is [...] "the best singer that we've got on the planet". About the impact that Cornell had in his life, Vedder told a crowd in Alpine Valley before performing [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] with him in September 2011; “I had no idea how he would affect my life and my views on music and my views on friendship and what a big impact he would have. These guys [...] know him much longer than me and his impact is profound”. The friendship between Vedder and Cornell is also featured in the 2011 documentary Pearl Jam Twenty. During his solo concert in London on June 6, 2017, Vedder talked for the first time about Cornell since his death on May 18, 2017, saying that [...] "he wasn't just a friend, he was someone <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> like my older brother" [...] and [...] "I will live with those memories in my heart and I will love him forever".|$|E
