25|$|There {{are more}} factors to {{consider}} when deciding between ceiling- and floor-mounted systems. Ceiling-mounted systems require substantial ceiling space and, therefore, reduce the options to install surgical lights or booms. Nonetheless, many hospitals choose ceiling-mounted systems because they cover the whole body with more flexibility and – most importantly – without moving the table. The latter is sometimes a difficult and dangerous undertaking during surgery with the many lines and catheters that must also be moved. Moving from a parking to a working position during surgery, however, is easier with a floor-mounted system, because the C-arm just turns in from the side and does {{not interfere with the}} anesthesiologist. The ceiling-mounted system, by contrast, during surgery can hardly move to a parking position at the <b>head</b> <b>end</b> without colliding with anesthesia equipment. In an overcrowded environment like the OR, biplane systems add to the complexity and interfere with anesthesia, except for neurosurgery, where anesthesia is not at the <b>head</b> <b>end.</b> Monoplane <b>systems</b> are therefore clearly recommended for rooms mainly used for cardiac surgery.|$|R
50|$|Most {{of these}} coaches use a 480 volt <b>head</b> <b>end</b> power (HEP) <b>system</b> for heating, lighting, and air conditioning. The only {{exception}} to this is with GO Transit which uses a 575 volt system (575 volts is a standard industrial Canadian voltage, having been previously used by CN for their Tempo cars — also built by HS). Whenever GO has leased coaches to other agencies, a power unit has been supplied with the coaches, or when GO has leased coaches from other agencies, a locomotive with 480 volt HEP capabilities was also leased. Amtrak, Via Rail and the Réseau de transport métropolitain also use 480 volt HEP (480 volt is a standard industrial U.S. voltage).|$|R

50|$|A <b>head</b> <b>end</b> power {{car is a}} {{rail car}} that {{supplies}} <b>head</b> <b>end</b> power (HEP). Since most modern locomotives supply HEP they are mostly used by heritage railways that use older locomotives, or by railroad museums that take their equipment on excursions.

40|$|A {{single batch}} of {{dissolver}} solution from the eleventh Rocky Flats Scrub Alloy (RFSA) {{campaign has been}} analyzed for chloride content following <b>head</b> <b>end</b> treatment to reduce its concentration. Scrub alloy buttons were dissolved in Tank 6. 4 D during May. In subsequent <b>head</b> <b>end</b> processing, chloride was precipitated with mercurous ion added as the nitrate. The precipitate, Hg{sub 2 }Cl{sub 2 }, was concurrently removed with the gelatin floc via centrifugation. Duplicate samples from Tank 11. 2, containing the <b>head</b> <b>end</b> product, produced excellent agreement between their density measurements, acid analyses, and gross alpha activities, indicating them to be truly representative of the tank`s contents. Duplicate aliquots from each of these solutions were analyzed using the turbidimetric chloride method developed in the Separations Technology Laboratory.

Relative standard deviation of the measurement was {+-} 4 ppm (n = 4), a precision of {+-} 10 %. Such a variance is normal at this low chloride level. Since initial chloride values prior to <b>head</b> <b>end</b> averaged 1455 ppm (0. 041 M), as analyzed by Laboratories Department, a chloride DF of approximately 35 was obtained.
