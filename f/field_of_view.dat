The dome was originally designed to mount a small transit, and the lengthy telescope, over 2 metres long, had a limited <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> though the dome's opening. A large stone pillar was constructed inside the tower, raising the telescope to bring it closer to the dome and improve its <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Unfortunately, the new telescope was unable {{to take part in the}} transit measurements due to bad weather, and missed the 1895 Transit of Mercury for the same reason.|$|E

5|$|The viewing {{portion of}} a {{reflector}} sight does not use any refractive optical elements, {{it is simply a}} projected reticle bounced off a beam splitter or curved mirror right into the users eye. This gives it the defining characteristics of not needing considerable experience and skill to use, as opposed to simple mechanical sights such as iron sights. A reflector sight also does not have the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> and eye relief problems of sights based on optical telescopes: depending on design constraints their <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is the user's naked eye <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and their non-focusing collimated nature means they don't have the optical telescopes constraint of eye relief. Reflector sights can be combined with telescopes, usually by placing the telescope directly behind the sight so it can view the projected reticle creating a telescopic sight, but this re-introduces the problems of narrow <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> and limited eye relief. The primary drawback of reflector sight is that they need some way to illuminate the reticle to function. Reticles illuminated by ambient light are hard to use in low light situations, and sights with electrical illumination stop functioning altogether if that system fails.|$|E

In August 2016, the Microsoft Windows version was updated to provide support for Nvidia's Ansel extension, which allows players to compose shots to be rendered in ultra-high resolutions or for 3D and virtual reality devices. Following Sony's announcement of the PlayStation 4 Pro, Blow affirmed they will patch the game for that console to support 4k resolutions without sacrificing framerate.

5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle.

40|$|Archerfish {{are famous}} for {{spitting}} jets of water to capture terrestrial insects, a task that not only requires oral dexterity, but also the ability to detect small camouflaged prey against a visually complex background of overhanging foliage. Because detection of olfactory, auditory and tactile cues is diminished at air-water interfaces, archerfish must depend almost entirely on visual cues to mediate their sensory interactions with the aerial world. During spitting, their eyes remain below the water 2 ̆ 7 s surface and must adapt to the optical demands of both aquatic and aerial <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> These challenges suggest that archerfish eyes may be specially adapted to life at the interface between air and water. Using microspectrophotometry to characterize the spectral absorbance of photoreceptors, we find that archerfish have differentially tuned their rods and cones across their retina, correlated with spectral differences in aquatic and aerial <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Spatial resolving power also differs for aquatic and aerial <b>fields</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> with maximum visual resolution (6. 9 cycles per degree) aligned with their preferred spitting angle.
