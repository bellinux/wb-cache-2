2500|$|The Loebner Prize tests {{conversational}} intelligence; {{winners are}} typically chatterbot programs, or Artificial Conversational Entities (ACE)s. Early Loebner Prize rules restricted conversations: Each entry and hidden-human conversed {{on a single}} topic, thus the interrogators were restricted to one line of questioning per entity interaction. The restricted conversation rule was lifted for the 1995 Loebner Prize. Interaction duration between judge and entity has varied in Loebner Prizes. In Loebner 2003, at the University of Surrey, each interrogator was allowed five minutes to interact with an entity, machine or hidden-human. Between 2004 and 2007, the interaction time allowed in Loebner Prizes was more than twenty minutes. In 2008, the interrogation duration allowed was five minutes per pair, because the organiser, Kevin Warwick, and coordinator, Huma Shah, consider {{this to be the}} duration for any test, as Turing stated in his 1950 paper: [...] " ... making the right identification after five minutes of questioning". They felt Loebner's longer test, implemented in Loebner Prizes 2006 and 2007, was inappropriate for the state of artificial conversation technology. It is ironic that the 2008 winning entry, <b>Elbot</b> from Artificial Solutions, does not mimic a human; its personality is that of a robot, yet <b>Elbot</b> deceived three human judges that it was the human during human-parallel comparisons.|$|E

50|$|In the finals, each of {{the judges}} was given five minutes to conduct simultaneous, split-screen conversations with two hidden entities. <b>Elbot</b> of Artificial Solutions won the 2008 Loebner Prize bronze award, for most human-like {{artificial}} conversational entity, through fooling three of the twelve judges who interrogated it (in the human-parallel comparisons) into believing it was human. This is coming {{very close to the}} 30% traditionally required to consider that a program has actually passed the Turing test. Eugene Goostman and Ultra Hal both deceived one judge each that it was the human.|$|E
50|$|Eugene Goostman {{competed in}} a number of Turing test competitions, {{including}} the Loebner Prize contest; it finished joint second in the Loebner test in 2001, and came second to Jabberwacky in 2005 and to <b>Elbot</b> in 2008. On 23 June 2012, Goostman won a Turing test competition at Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, held to mark the centenary of its namesake, Alan Turing. The competition, which featured five bots, twenty-five hidden humans, and thirty judges, was considered to be the largest-ever Turing test contest by its organizers. After a series of five-minute-long text conversations, 29% of the judges were convinced that the bot was an actual human.|$|E
40|$|In 1950 Alan Turing {{introduced}} the famous “Turing test” which tests if a machine {{can be as}} intelligent as a human by testing if it can communicate with {{a person in a}} “human” way. Inspired by this test, numerous so called chatbots, in the form of computer programs, that manage a written dialogue have been created. A so called commonsensedatabase consists of data that most humans would know andconsider as common knowledge, something that computers generally do not know very muchabout. This report describes the process of an attempt to implement a simple chatbot using the common-sense database ConceptNet. The behaviour, or the human-likeness, of this chatbot was then compared to that of the classic chatbot ELIZA and the 2008 Loebner prize winning chatbot <b>Elbot,</b> through a series of user tests. The results indicate that using a common-sense database for a chatbot shows some promisefor further investigation...|$|E
40|$|To find {{if current}} {{dialogue}} systems use the same, psychotherapist questioning technique as Joseph Weizenbaum's 1960 {{natural language understanding}} programme, Eliza, the authors carried out an original experiment comparing five successful artificial dialogue systems, Cleverbot, <b>Elbot,</b> Eugene Goostman, JFred and Ultra Hal with an online version of Eliza. More than one hundred male and female participants with 1 st or non- 1 st English language, age range 13 – 64, interacted with the systems over the Internet scoring each for conversation ability. Developers of the modern conversation systems show they deploy {{a variety of techniques}} to initiate and maintain dialogue learning from interactions with humans over the Internet. Statistical significance shows these dialogue systems are an improvement on their predecessor. Embedded on the web affording round-the-clock interaction the nature of artificial dialogue systems is evolving as these systems learn from the way humans converse. The uses of modern Elizas are proven successful as virtual assistants in e-commerce; their conversational basis is already extending into education. What we can say is modern artificial dialogue systems do talk. They are able to participate in conversation in a way their predecessor Eliza could not: they are able to share personal opinions, relay experience of family dramas, be relevant, but also be vague, and mislead just as humans do...|$|E
