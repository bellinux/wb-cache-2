Surprisingly, the job characteristics that benefit employees’ work-life balance – income and autonomy – {{do not have a}} similar effect on that of managers: higher income does not affect work-life balance, and autonomy even negatively affects it.

This paper focuses on the balance fatigue design of these two parts in a cast steel node joint using fracture mechanics and FEM. The defects in castings are simulated by cracks conservatively. The final crack size is decided by the minimum of 90 % of the wall thickness and the value deduced by fracture toughness.

However, research about how the life story changes and how meaning will be experienced in occupations is lacking. The aim was to describe and offer an explanation of how a man experienced meaning in everyday occupations while aging with an SCI. Four narrative interviews were performed over a four-year period, with a man in his fifties, who lived with SCI for 39 years. The narrative analysis generated an overall plot, named “To Work Just Like Anyone Else,” and gives a picture of his experiences, thoughts, and reflections about meaning in occupations, from when he became injured to the present, and in relation to his future. His life story is characterized by secondary health complications, and his experiences of negotiating with the aging body and making choices to continue working. Further, how occupational risk factors, e. g., imbalance, alienation, and deprivation, occur as a result of lack of rehabilitation and support from social systems is addressed. Future research should explore how rehabilitation and social systems can support people aging with SCI to experience meaning in everyday occupations and to <b>have</b> <b>balance</b> in everyday <b>life...</b>|$|R
