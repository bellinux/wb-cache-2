5|$|Alpha {{silicon carbide}} (α-SiC) {{is the most}} {{commonly}} encountered polymorph; it is <b>formed</b> <b>at</b> temperatures greater than 1700°C and has a hexagonal crystal structure (similar to Wurtzite). The beta modification (β-SiC), with a zinc blende crystal structure (similar to diamond), is <b>formed</b> <b>at</b> temperatures below 1700°C. Until recently, the beta form has had relatively few commercial uses, although there is now increasing interest in its use as a support for heterogeneous catalysts, owing to its higher surface area compared to the alpha form.|$|E
5|$|Many neptunium(IV) {{coordination}} compounds {{have been}} reported, {{the first one}} being , which is isostructural with the analogous uranium(IV) coordination compound. Other Np(IV) coordination compounds are known, some involving other metals such as cobalt (·8H2O, <b>formed</b> <b>at</b> 400K) and copper (·6H2O, <b>formed</b> <b>at</b> 600K). Complex nitrate compounds are also known: the experimenters who produced them in 1986 and 1987 produced single crystals by slow evaporation of the Np(IV) solution at ambient temperature in concentrated nitric acid and excess 2,2′-pyrimidine.|$|E

50|$|As was mentioned, ice XI can {{theoretically}} <b>form</b> <b>at</b> low pressures {{at temperatures}} between 50-70 K - temperatures present in astrophysical environments {{of the outer}} solar system and within permanently shaded polar craters on the Moon and Mercury.

Extrapolating from experimental measurements, it is estimated to take ~50 years to <b>form</b> <b>at</b> 70 K and ~300 million years at 50 K.
