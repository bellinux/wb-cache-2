5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E

25|$|The {{conflict}} in the City of Compostela reached its zenith in September 1320, when after forty years of autonomy and two years of war, the new archbishop, the French Bérenger de Landore, assassinated the nobleman Alonso Suárez de Deza together {{with the members of}} the City Council in his castle of A Rocha Forte near Santiago, where he had attracted them for talks. While Berenger's forcefulness temporarily pacified the city, he still had to fight for another year <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the rest of the fiefdom. However, twenty-five years later, the City Council of Compostela obtained the long-sought reguengo status, granted by King Alfonso XI. Similar conflicts are also known in other Galician cities.|$|E
500|$|Parlophone's {{advertising}} campaign was unorthodox. The label took full-page advertisements in high-profile British newspapers and tube stations with lyrics for [...] "Fitter Happier" [...] pitched in large black letters against white backgrounds. The same lyrics, and artwork {{adapted from the}} album, were repurposed for shirt designs. Yorke said, [...] "We actively chose to pursue the 'Fitter Happier' thing" [...] to link what a critic called [...] "a coherent set of concerns" [...] between the album artwork and its promotional material. More unconventional merchandise included a floppy disk with Radiohead screensavers and an FM radio {{in the shape of}} a desktop computer. In America, Capitol sent 1,000 cassette players to prominent members of the press and music industry, each with a copy of the album permanently glued inside. When asked about the campaign after the album's release, Capitol president Gary Gersh said, [...] "Our job is <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them as a left-of-center band and bring the center to them.

500|$|When Steven S.

DeKnight knew Bart had faster than Clark, because in the comic, that is one advantage Flash has over Superman. DeKnight also featured Bart as a [...] "smart-ass", after being inspired by the sarcastic Flash that appears in the animated television series, Justice League. DeKnight's belief is that Bart enjoys his powers, and would not exhibit the more [...] "somber or serious" [...] characteristics of other character. As Gallner pointed out, Bart accepts who he is, and what he can do, and he even abuses his gifts somewhat. The difference between him and Clark is that Bart is not afraid to show the world what he can do. Gallner also suggested that in his character's initial appearance, Bart is living in a [...] "confused" [...] state, because he has developed these extraordinary powers, his parents do not accept him, and he ends up turning to thievery <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of himself.|$|E

Mr. Joffe looked astonishedly at me with his gentle eyes and was silent for a while.

2500|$|The other {{complaint}} {{is that the}} medicines must be taken {{on an empty stomach}} to facilitate absorption. [...] This can be difficult for patients to follow (for example, shift workers who take their meals at irregular times) and may mean the patient waking up an hour earlier than usual everyday <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> medication. [...] The rules are actually less stringent than many physicians and pharmacists realise: the issue is that the absorption of RMP is reduced if taken with fat, but is unaffected by carbohydrate, protein, or antacids. [...] So the patient can in fact have his or her medication with food as long as the meal does not contain fat or oils (e.g., a cup of black coffee or toast with jam and no butter). Taking the medicines with food also helps ease the nausea that many patients feel when taking the medicines on an empty stomach. [...] The effect of food on the absorption of INH is not clear: two studies have shown reduced absorption with food but one study showed no difference. There is a small effect of food on the absorption of PZA and of EMB that is probably not clinically important.|$|E
2500|$|Bob Thomas, senior {{executive}} {{of the church in}} the early 1970s, gave a prosaic description.The immediate goal of the E-meter is to enhance communication. In other words, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a parallel: if an analyst were allowing his patient to free-associate, and the patient were connected in some way with a galvanometer which showed the analyst what things the patient mentioned were emotionally charged and what things were not emotionally charged, a lot of time would be saved. So it's simply an assist for the practitioner to direct the individual to areas which he himself may not realize are troubled or charged with emotion or are repressed; and to better direct his attention into those areas ...The E-meter is a simple psycho-galvanometer. It's got some increased sensitivity built into it and the myological reactions that you sometimes get in the galvanometer have been damped out by the circuitry, so that the mental reactions, the reactions of the spirit, on the body are emphasized and can be read more clearly. But that's simply the design of the circuitry; it doesn't basically affect the kind of device. It registers what is called, commonly, the psychogalvanomic reflex, which is a reflex that is a poorly understood mechanism of the psyche. The body resistance seems to vary when the individual thinks of a painful or pain-associated or traumatic-associated concept, or word or idea. ...

2500|$|After the battle, Iowa left Cuban waters for New York City, {{arriving}} on 20 August. While being towed by four tugboats to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Iowa came [...] "very near colliding with the cruiser Chicago" [...] after a hawser attached to one tugboat broke; a new hawser was hurriedly run out to Iowas bow, preventing a collision. On 12 October, she departed for the Pacific, sailed through the Straits of Magellan at Cape Horn. A reporter on board describing the passage wrote [...] "snow-capped mountains {{rising out of}} the sea, barren and gray just below the snow" [...] along with [...] "furious squalls called williwaws" [...] which [...] "picks up the water in masses of foam." [...] While stationed in Valparaíso, Chile around 17 December, and later at Callao, Peru around 26 December, the sailors of Iowa along with [...] gave on-board self-created performances for audiences including select sailors from the navies of Chile and Peru as a way to ease tensions following the conflict over Cuba (some South Americans sided with Spain.) The self-described [...] "Iowa Minstrels" [...] made a [...] "melange of music, melody, and mirth" [...] featuring a written program which included such entertainment as an overture, juggling, acrobatics, a [...] "gifted Hibernian orator", comic sketches, singing, and banjo playing. She arrived in San Francisco, California on 7 February 1899. While in port, the crew presented Captain Evans with a sword bearing the inscription [...] "To our hero—Too <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a fallen foe's—We give this sword instead." [...] This referred to Captain Evans' refusal to accept Captain Don Antonio Eulate's sword after the Battle of Santiago. The captain thanked his crew for their bravery and respect in a published reply. The battleship then steamed to Bremerton, Washington, where she entered drydock on 11 June. After refit, Iowa served in the Pacific Squadron for 2 years under the command of Captain Goodrich, conducting training cruises, drills, and target practice. On 1 August 1900, the British cruiser [...] narrowly avoided colliding with Iowa in the straits near Victoria (British Columbia) during a dense fog. At another point during these years, a manhole plate of a boiler blew open and the determined actions of five crewmen (see below) spared the ship from further disaster. Iowa left the Pacific in 1902 to become the flagship of the South Atlantic Squadron. She went to New York arriving February 1903 and was again decommissioned in June.|$|E
