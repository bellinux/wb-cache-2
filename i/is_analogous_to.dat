5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, {{have the same}} colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E

5|$|After Neil Bartlett's {{discovery}} in 1962 that xenon can form chemical compounds, {{a large number}} of xenon compounds have been discovered and described. Almost all known xenon compounds contain the electronegative atoms fluorine or oxygen.

5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess {{emission of}} infrared radiation, Vega {{appears to have}} a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust {{is likely to be the}} result of collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars which display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.|$|E
5|$|In the Wujing Zongyao {{and other}} {{military}} texts, the distinction between a bomb and a grenade is ambiguous. At the time, the Chinese usually did not categorize gunpowder weapons according to their delivery method.

5|$|There is thus {{a causal}} chain which transmits {{information}} from a sense organ to an organ capable of making decisions, and onwards to a motor organ.

5|$|Thus, the {{ammonium}} ion, , {{plays the}} same role in liquid ammonia as does the hydronium ion in water and the amide ion, , <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the hydroxide ion. Ammonium salts behave as acids, and amides behave as bases.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar {{with the concept of}} transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E

5|$|Each {{solution}} of Einstein's equation encompasses {{the whole history}} of a universe— it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> gauge fixing in other field theories.|$|E
5|$|In aqueous solution, vanadium(V) {{forms an}} {{extensive}} family of oxyanions. The interrelationships {{in this family}} are described by the predominance diagram, which shows at least 11 species, depending on pH and concentration. The tetrahedral orthovanadate ion, , is the principal species present at pH 12-14. Similar in size and charge to phosphorus(V), vanadium(V) also parallels its chemistry and crystallography. Orthovanadate V is used in protein crystallography to study the biochemistry of phosphate. The tetrathiovanadate 3− <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the orthovanadate ion.|$|E
5|$|In his {{doctoral}} thesis, Ehlers {{pointed out}} a duality symmetry between different components of the metric of a stationary vacuum spacetime, which maps solutions of Einstein's field equations to other solutions. This symmetry between the tt-component of the metric, which describes time as measured by clocks whose spatial coordinates do not change, and a term known as the twist potential <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the aforementioned duality between E and B.|$|E

5|$|LARP {{has also}} been {{referred}} to as live role-playing (LRP), interactive literature, and free form role-playing. Some of these terms are still in common use; however, LARP has become the most commonly accepted term. It is sometimes written in lowercase, as larp. The live action in LARP <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the term live action used in film and video to differentiate works with human actors from animation. Playing a LARP is often called larping, and one who does it is a larper.|$|E
5|$|Repeat {{this process}} {{a number of}} times, {{randomly}} reproducing each generation of marbles to form the next. The numbers of red and blue marbles picked each generation fluctuates; sometimes more red and sometimes more blue.

5|$|Ruthenium forms a {{wide range}} {{compounds}} with carbon-ruthenium bonds. Grubbs' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis. Ruthenocene <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> ferrocene structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. The colorless liquid ruthenium pentacarbonyl converts {{in the absence of}} CO pressure to the dark red solid triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. Ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride (RuCl2(PPh3)3), which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh3)3).|$|E
5|$|Several oxides of cobalt are known. Green cobalt(II) oxide (CoO) has rocksalt structure. It {{is readily}} {{oxidized}} {{with water and}} oxygen to brown cobalt(III) hydroxide (Co(OH)3). At temperatures of 600–700°C, CoO oxidizes to the blue cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4), which has a spinel structure. Black cobalt(III) oxide (Co2O3) is also known. Cobalt oxides are antiferromagnetic at low temperature: CoO (Néel temperature 291K) and Co3O4 (Néel temperature: 40K), which <b>is</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> magnetite (Fe3O4), {{with a mixture of}} +2 and +3 oxidation states.|$|E
