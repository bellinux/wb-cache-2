2500|$|Guitarist DJ Ashba {{has said}} that the next album is being discussed, stating that the band [...] "has been {{throwing}} around a bunch of ideas" [...] and joked that the next album [...] "won't take as long" [...] to release. On April 20, 2011, Ashba said in an interview at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards that Guns N' Roses have been [...] "working on new songs every day". In an interview with reporter Nui Te Koha on Triple M Melbourne's The Hot Breakfast, Ashba talked about songs Rose has written, stating: [...] "Axl has a lot of great songs up his sleeve. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> three albums worth of stuff recorded. The stuff I've heard... I've been up in his hotel room many nights and he just sits down at the piano and plays. I'm like 'this is amazing, people have to hear this song' and he's like [...] "ah, this is something I'm tinkering on'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is not my}} business," [...] he said. [...] "My {{fees are}} paid, and the steamer tickets {{appear to be in}} order. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> wealthy friends." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} has become of the major," [...] she said at length, with a little laugh. [...] "It is too hot for fine casting, and <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> had enough of it. After all, it really doesn't matter that the fish won't rise." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ingleby laughed, {{a trifle}} scornfully. [...] "Did you expect {{anything}} else? When {{a man who}} could have made himself almost anything he wished gives himself up to a life of privation for the good of his fellows, it's a little gained when men of Tomlinson's description are willing to admit that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> good intentions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And why? Why did {{you want}} to extract their {{property}} from their pockets, and to put it into your own? That the footpad on the road should have such desire when, with his pistol, he stops the traveller on his journey we all understand. And we know what we think of the footpad,--and what we do to him. He is a poor creature, who from his youth upwards has had no good thing done for him, uneducated, an outcast, whom we should pity more than we despise him. We take him as a pest which we cannot endure, and lock him up where he can harm us no more. On my word, Gerald, I think that the so-called gentleman who sits down with the deliberate intention of extracting money from the pockets of his antagonists, who lays out for himself that way of repairing the shortcomings of fortune, who looks to that resource as an aid to his means,--is worse, much worse, than the public robber! He is meaner, more cowardly, and has I think in his bosom less of the feelings of an honest man. And <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> been educated,--as you have been. He calls himself a gentleman. He should know black from white. It is considered terrible to cheat at cards." ...|$|E
50|$|Glaber was {{a member}} of a Roman plebeian family. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> very distant {{familial}} connections to the Claudian clan.|$|R
50|$|From 1793 to 1801 Haigh {{lived in}} Manchester, where <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> family connections. <b>He</b> died in London in April 1808.|$|R
50|$|Temilotzin {{is remembered}} by one poem. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> more poems, but this poem {{is the only}} one that survived. The poem is about making friends.|$|R
6000|$|Our man of {{gingerbread}} {{and apples}} {{is not a}} specimen of the [...] "needy man who has seen better days." [...] Doubtless there have been better and brighter days in the far-off time of his youth; but none with so much sunshine of prosperity in them that the chill, the depression, the narrowness of means, in his declining years, can have come upon him by surprise. His life has all been of a piece. His subdued and nerveless boyhood prefigured his abortive prime, which likewise contained within itself the prophecy and image of his lean and torpid age. He was perhaps a mechanic, who never came to be a master in his craft, or a petty tradesman, rubbing onward between passably to do and poverty. Possibly he may look back to some brilliant epoch of his career when there were a hundred or two of dollars to his credit in the Savings Bank. Such {{must have been the}} extent of his better fortune,--his little measure of this world's triumphs,--all that he has known of success. A meek, downcast, humble, uncomplaining creature, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> never felt himself entitled to more than so much of the gifts of Providence. Is it not still something that he has never held out his hand for charity, nor has yet been driven to that sad home and household of Earth's forlorn and broken-spirited children, the almshouse? He cherishes no quarrel, therefore, with his destiny, nor with the Author of it. All is as it should be.|$|E
6000|$|Felix frowned. [...] "Am I? Be honest! Take {{the life}} of a Malloring and take it at its best; see how it stands {{comparison}} in the ordinary virtues with those of an averagely good specimen of a farm-laborer. Your Malloring is called with a cup of tea, at, say, seven o'clock, out of a nice, clean, warm bed; he gets into a bath that has been got ready for him; into clothes and boots that have been brushed for him; and goes down to a room where there's a fire burning already if it's a cold day, writes a few letters, perhaps, before eating a breakfast of exactly what he likes, nicely prepared for him, and reading the newspaper that best comforts his soul; when he has eaten and read, he lights his cigar or his pipe and attends to his digestion in the most sanitary and comfortable fashion; then in his study he sits down to steady direction of other people, either by interview or by writing letters, or what not. In this way, between directing people and eating what he likes, he passes the whole day, except that for two or three hours, sometimes indeed seven or eight hours, he attends to his physique by riding, motoring, playing a game, or indulging in a sport that he has chosen for himself. And, at the end of all that, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> another bath that has been made ready for him, puts on clean clothes that have been put out for him, goes down to a good dinner that has been cooked for him, smokes, reads, learns, and inwardly digests, or else plays cards, billiards, and acts host till he is sleepy, and so to bed, in a clean, warm bed, in a clean, fresh room. Is that exaggerated?" ...|$|E
60|$|Literary {{criticism}} in the present day has become a profession,--but it has ceased to be an art. Its object is no longer that of proving that certain literary work is good and other literary work is bad, in accordance with rules which the critic is able to define. English criticism at present rarely even pretends to {{go so far as}} this. It attempts, in the first place, to tell the public whether a book be or be not worth public attention; and, in the second place, so to describe the purport of the work as to enable those who have not time or inclination for reading it to feel that by a short cut they can become acquainted with its contents. Both these objects, if fairly well carried out, are salutary. Though the critic may not be a profound judge himself; though not unfrequently he be a young man making his first literary attempts, with tastes and judgment still unfixed, yet <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> a conscience in the matter, and would not have been selected for that work had he not shown some aptitude for it. Though he may be not the best possible guide to the undiscerning, he will be better than no guide at all. Real substantial criticism must, from its nature, be costly, and that which the public wants should at any rate be cheap. Advice is given to many thousands, which, though {{it may not be the}} best advice possible, is better than no advice at all. Then that description of the work criticised, that compressing of the much into very little,--which is the work of many modern critics or reviewers,--does enable many to know something of what is being said, who without it would know nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{the fashion}} {{in which such}} a one as I would know such a one as the Duke, I knew him. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> {{forgotten}} my existence." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> his {{education}} at Clitheroe grammar school; he married Frances, daughter of Richard Greenacres, of Worston, near Downham; {{and he died}} 16 April 1625, leaving issue.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{if he was}} {{a disciple}} of Magnerich <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> access to the court of the German kings. [...] He was {{reportedly}} buried after his death in Trier Cathedral.|$|R
6000|$|But I did {{not mean}} to make even this slight {{departure}} from the main business of these papers, which is to confide my literary passions to the reader; <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> had a great many of his own. I think I may class the [...] "Ring and the Book" [...] among them, though I have never been otherwise a devotee of Browning. But I was still newly home from Italy, or away from home, when that poem appeared, and {{whether or not it was}} because it took me so with the old enchantment of that land, I gave my heart promptly to it. Of course, there are terrible longueurs in it, and you do get tired of the same story told over and over from the different points of view, and yet it is such a great story, and unfolded with such a magnificent breadth and noble fulness, that one who blames it lightly blames himself heavily. There are certain books of it--"Caponsacchi's story," [...] "Pompilia's story," [...] and [...] "Count Guido's story"--that I think ought to rank with the greatest poetry ever written, and that have a direct, dramatic expression of the fact and character, which is without rival. There is a noble and lofty pathos in the close of Caponsacchi's statement, an artless and manly break from his self-control throughout, that seems to me the last possible effect in its kind; and Pompilia's story holds all of womanhood in it, the purity, the passion, the tenderness, the helplessness. But if I begin to praise this or any of the things I have liked, I do not know when I should stop. Yes, as I think it over, the [...] "Ring and the Book" [...] appears to me one of the great few poems whose splendor can never suffer lasting eclipse, however it may have presently fallen into abeyance. If it had impossibly come down to us from some elder time, or had not been so perfectly modern in its recognition of feeling and motives ignored by the less conscious poetry of the past, it might be ranked with the great epics.|$|E
50|$|A polio {{survivor}} himself, he {{was then}} involved in Rotary International's Polio Plus immunization in from its inception in 1979, till 1995. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> the international {{distinction of being the}} person who has himself administered the polio vaccine to the most number of children.|$|E
50|$|Doctors {{believe that}} Bisad is {{suffering}} from a condition called pituitary giantism, that makes growth continue after most people stop developing. Expert in abnormal growth Professor Mike Besser, from Bart’s Hospital, Central London, said <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> a tumour in the pituitary gland behind his eyes.|$|E
50|$|Sources {{writing about}} Garlandia {{in the late}} 13th and early 14th century also call him a magister, {{indicating}} <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a role as {{a teacher at the}} University of Paris.|$|R
50|$|During {{the court}} case in Alice Springs in 2007 <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> his first {{heart attack and}} his health {{declined}} consistently from that point. He struggled with diabetes and heart disease and their consequences.|$|R

50|$|The young man, on {{arriving}} at the lady's house, eats with her and meets the husband of the lady, who appears bored and frigid, {{but not in the}} least resentful of the presence of the lover (<b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> a mistress of his own somewhere). Lunch is followed by coffee and games.|$|E
50|$|Schoolteacher {{and family}} man Ed Avery (James Mason), {{who has been}} {{suffering}} bouts of severe pain and even blackouts, is hospitalized with what is diagnosed as polyarteritis nodosa, a rare inflammation of the arteries.

6000|$|... 'No--and I rather {{wondered}} at it. But {{she seemed to}} have forgotten it--indeed, she didn't make any inquiry at all, only standing behind him, listening to his; and <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> never been told anything about it.' ...|$|R
50|$|It is {{postulated}} that Faustus married the noblewoman Amnia Demetrias, with whom <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> {{at least two}} sons: Amnius Anicius Julianus, Consul of Rome in 322 and Sextus Anicius Faustus Paulinus, the Roman consul of AD 325.|$|R

5000|$|Equus: Real name, Raphe Equus. Equus is {{the result}} of 400 years of {{selective}} breeding, an attempt to create gifted individuals that was started by Dr. John Dee and the man known as [...] "Mother" [...] during the creation of the first incarnation of Establishment. His powers are unknown, but based upon certain events within the series {{it is fair to say}} that <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> some levels of super strength, endurance, and intelligence. Equus is loosely based on John Steed from the television show The Avengers.|$|E
5000|$|Bassist Dan Andriano notes that: it {{was kind}} of the same as always. We just spent a little more time in all areas of the {{recording}} process. We spent a little more time in pre-production, where we worked on the songs with Jerry. Before we started recording, he came out to Chicago and to practices and he was listening to the songs, and we had an opportunity to ask him what he thought. It kind of gave us more time to re-work some stuff that we thought could have been a little better but were a little stumped on, as Jerry had good ideas for the songs. And as far as the actual recording, it was great working with him. It was more like working with a friend. We've known Jerry for a long time, and he's really easy to work with and be around for 12 hours a day. He's got an amazing gear collection. Any kind of guitar you want to use for a song or any kind of amplifier, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> it—and <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> one of the nicest ones of that model. To me, recording was like being in a playground. It's just like, [...] "Let me play this one. Let me try this." [...] Every bass track on the record was recorded with an old Marshall guitar amp.|$|E
50|$|Publius’s {{promising}} {{career was}} cut short when he died along with his father in an ill-conceived war against the Parthian Empire. Cornelia, with whom <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> no children, then married the much older Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great").|$|R
50|$|Hussowczyk {{became a}} courtier of Erazm Ciołek, the Bishop of Płock. In 1521 he {{accompanied}} the bishop on his year-long journey to Rome and {{he returned to}} Poland after Ciołek's death, settling in Kraków, where <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> his ordination.|$|R
50|$|Anicius Faustus is speculated to {{have married}} either a Vesia Rustica or a Sergia Paulla, {{daughter}} of Lucius Sergius Paullus, consul ordinary 168. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> {{at least one}} son, Quintus Anicius Faustus Paulinus, who was a suffect consul sometime before AD 230.|$|R
