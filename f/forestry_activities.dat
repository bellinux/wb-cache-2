5|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the village of Papingo plays an essential role in management issues. Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, <b>forestry</b> <b>activities,</b> grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone there are no such restrictions, but the Forest Service can take any necessary measure for the realization of the aims of the park. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, dangers to the park include land erosion, landslides, and wildfires which threaten the local flora and fauna. Another issue is the impact of tourism in recent decades. On the other hand, extreme geophysical conditions make the construction and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure network, mainly access routes and telecommunications, difficult.|$|E

The aim of this paper is to analyze the importance and effects of <b>forestry</b> <b>activity</b> for the labor market and the local and regional economy of Três Lagoas-MS. This context was explored from secondary and primary data, using the mixed method research, with qualitative and quantitative data. The results show that <b>forestry</b> <b>activity</b> was important for the labor market and the economy of Três Lagoas and the region, contributing to the opening of new enterprises and improvement of existing businesses. There was also a quantitative and qualitative change in the local labor market, with increased jobs, increased income, increased average salary and intensification of training and qualification programs of people for the labor market, demonstrating growth and development in this aspect. It is verified that <b>forestry</b> <b>activity</b> is important for local, regional and state economy, and it has boosted entrepreneurship and generated positive effects on the labor market, however, it alerts to the region’s vulnerability due to its dependence as a prevailing activity, which it keeps many jobs and businesses settled in the city to serve, direct or indirectly, the <b>forestry</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Cases of rabid wolves are low when {{compared}} to other species since wolves do not serve as primary reservoirs of the disease, but can be infected with rabies from other animals such as dogs, golden jackals and foxes. Cases of rabies in wolves are very rare in North America, though numerous in the eastern Mediterranean, Middle East and Central Asia. The reason for this is unclear, though it may be connected with the presence of jackals in those areas, as jackals have been identified as primary carriers. Wolves apparently develop the [...] "furious" [...] phase of rabies to a very high degree, which, coupled with their size and strength, makes rabid wolves perhaps the most dangerous of rabid animals, with bites from rabid wolves being 15 times more dangerous than those of rabid dogs. Rabid wolves usually act alone, traveling large distances and often biting large numbers of people and domestic animals. Most rabid wolf attacks occur in the spring and autumn periods. Unlike with predatory attacks, the victims of rabid wolves are not eaten, and the attacks generally only occur on a single day. Also, rabid wolves attack their victims at random, showing none of the selectivity displayed by predatory wolves, though the majority of recorded cases involve adult men, as men were frequently employed in agricultural and <b>forestry</b> <b>activities</b> which put them into contact with wolves.|$|E

40|$|Tasmania is {{the island}} state of Australia, {{approximately}} 160 kilometers (100 miles) {{south of the}} Australian mainland. The total karst area in Tasmania is around 3, 500 square kilometers (1, 345 square miles) repre-senting about 5 % of the total Tasmanian land surface of 68, 332 square kilometers (26, 215 square miles). Some 4, 000 caves are reportedly known, mostly found within the 135 documented karst areas; the karst bio-space within these areas contains a diverse array of invertebrates species, aquatic and terrestrial.
