500|$|Sebastian {{believes}} it is [...] "a great, inspirational song" [...] that summarises how any Australian Idol winner would have felt.

The B-side, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> Alone" [...] – a cover version of Robin Thicke's 2002 single – was recorded live on Australian Idol episode [...] "Up Close & Personal" [...] in October 2003.

500|$|Philip Matusavage in {{a review}} for the musicOMH pointed out the lines [...] "you're the shit, that makes you my equivalent" [...] as re-appropriation of [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> Alone" [...] (2002) by singer Robin Thicke. Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass likened the song to {{material}} on B'Day (2006), and complemented it as a [...] "vocal tour de force with eye-popping, quotable lyrics". BET Latifah Muhammad used the words [...] "assertive, feminine, coy and direct" [...] to describe the track. Una Mullally of The Irish Times dubbed [...] "Rocket" [...] as [...] "simple and inoffensive". Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast felt that Beyoncé managed to execute a modern Motown sound. Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger wrote that [...] "Rocket" [...] featured [...] "a thing or two {{to say about the}} irresistible siren call of her butt". Claire Lobenfeld from Complex found [...] "Rocket" [...] to be more sultry {{than the rest of the}} songs on the album. Tim Finney of the same publication highlighted [...] "Rocket" [...] as a [...] "relatively classicist... sex romp slow jam" [...] and concluded, [...] " [...] gradually disintegrates into a loosely interwoven patchwork of faux-improvised exclamations and exhalations as Beyoncé determinedly roots out every possible voluptuous vocal angle on the song's preoccupations".|$|E
500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E

500|$|Rachel's {{cover of}} [...] "Firework" [...] by Katy Perry was {{reviewed}} negatively by Coachman. She wrote, [...] "I'm not loving Michele’s vocals on this track. It {{was like they}} wanted to purposely make her sound like Katy Perry. As much as I really like Katy Perry, Michele has more of a tremendous voice. There are parts where I thought she sounded really great, {{but for the most}} part this song just wasn't my cup of tea. Michele has such a beautiful voice; I wish she was given songs that would allow her to showcase it to her advantage." [...] Katie Morgan of Billboard gave a positive review of the Warblers' performance of [...] "Silly Love Songs", writing, [...] "Not only do they sound great , but the song brings a sugary sweet end to a super-saccharine episode." [...] The Marquee Blog at CNN gave the music numbers a positive review. A notable segment reads: [...] "I just loved seeing The Warblers get their groove on amidst the jeans and cotton T-shirts. And Kurt was super gracious trying to be supportive of Blaine, in spite of his own feelings. I also totally loved the music [...] and overall this was one of my favorite episodes this season. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair praised Salling's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", as well as the casts' performances of [...] "P.Y.T." [...] by Michael Jackson and [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>You</b> Alone" [...] by Robin Thicke. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone gave Salling's performance a positive review. She wrote, [...] "We were thoroughly entertained by Puck's attempt to win newbie Lauren Zizes over with his tribute to her larger figure. Only in Puck's world would Queen's raucous song qualify as a serenade—and our horror-turned-amusement was mirrored on his fellow New Directions' faces. Puck is no Freddie Mercury, but he handles the melody well and makes up for lack of range with swagger." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Thicke {{released}} his debut single [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>You</b> Alone".
