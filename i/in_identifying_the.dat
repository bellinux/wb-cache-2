5|$|An {{alternate}} {{method of}} locating {{the site of}} a CSF leak is to use heavily T2-weighted MR myelography. This has been effective <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> sites of a CSF leak without the need for a CT scan, lumbar puncture, and contrast and at locating fluid collections such as CSF pooling. Another highly successful method of locating a CSF leak is intrathecal contrast and MR Myelography.|$|E
5|$|The {{results of}} {{statistical}} analysis will be strongly affected by any errors <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> inventory of glyphs, {{as well as}} by divergence from a purely syllabic representation, such as a glyph for reduplication. There are also large differences in the frequencies of individual syllables among the Rapanui texts, which makes any direct identification problematic. While Pozdniakov {{has not been able to}} assign any phonetic values with any certainty, statistical results do place constraints on which values are possible.|$|E
5|$|A {{good picture}} of the county in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E

5|$|Building on his progress, Champollion now {{began to}} study other texts in {{addition}} to the Rosetta stone, studying a series of much older inscriptions from Abu Simbel. During 1823, he succeeded <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> names of pharaohs Ramesses and Thutmose written in cartouches in these ancient texts. With the help of a new acquaintance the Duke de Blacas in 1824, Champollion finally published the Précis du système hiéroglyphique des anciens Égyptiens dedicated to and funded by King Louis XVIII. Here he presented the first correct translation of the hieroglyphs and the key to the Egyptian grammatical system.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> {{remains as}} those of Palaeoscincus, Broom {{initially}} classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed {{by the research of}} Coombs in the 1970s. However, in 1929, Nopcsa identified the taxon as a stegosaurid, with which most modern studies agree. In 1981, the genus was reviewed with modern taxonomy, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid. However, a more recent 2008 review of Stegosauria could only identify one distinguishing feature, and while that study still referred it to Stegosauridae based on similarity, no diagnostic features of the family could be identified in Paranthodon.|$|E

5|$|With {{sites such}} as Danebury {{where there is no}} modern {{habitation}} or built environment, extensive excavations can be undertaken to establish the general layout. The modern settlement of Mellor extends over the Iron Age hill fort, which restricts archaeological investigation. A geophysical survey was performed to establish the extent of the settlement; methods such as magnetometry and ground-penetrating radar were successful <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> eastern and northern sections of the ditch encircling the site. Excavations have been concentrated around the Old Vicarage. By 2004 there were 43trenches, 14trial trenches, and 17test pits. The investigation of the site has revealed two ditches. While the external ditch encloses a larger area, it has smaller dimensions than the internal ditch.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help <b>in</b> <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or toxic substances. The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E
