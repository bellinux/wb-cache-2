METHODS: One hundred and five patients were included in this case-control study. The case group consisted of 52 patients with non-contact injury of the anterior cruciate ligament. Fifty-three individuals with no history of symptoms regarding to feet or knees comprised the control group. An anthropometric assessment of the bony arch index was performed, which consisted of measuring the ratio of the height between the navicular bone to the ground and the distance from the most posterior support point of the calcaneus to the first metatarsal-phalangeal <b>joint.</b> <b>Gender,</b> height, weight, body mass index and the frequency of sports practice were also evaluated. RESULTS: Subjects in the case group had significantly higher medial longitudinal arches than individuals in the control group.

The paper studies a sample of PhDs and their corresponding employing firms to analyse patterns of mobility, economic returns and innovation outputs. Qualitative and quantitative indicators are combined to tackle two sets of general questions: The first relates to the incentives for doctorate holders to pursue company career versus an academic career. The second concerns the flexibility and/or reversibility of career options for young PhDs and the relative value of a doctorate outside academia. The results question {{the idea that the}} labour market for PhDs is tightly segmented and highlights the complementarity of PhDs' individual competencies and collective capabilities in the assessment of innovation outputs.

Methods: Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 0 – 10 pain scores, quality of life, body mass index (BMI), medication usage, and frequency of physical exercise/sports participation (none, 1 – 3 ×/week, more) were collected before the procedure, at 1 month post procedure (n= 160), and again at 6 (n= 73) and 12 months (n= 89) post procedure. Results: A VAS decrease of 4 points on a 10 -point scale (from 8 to 4) in the overall group was seen after 6 months and of 4. 5 after 12 months.

40|$|Abstract Nordic {{collaboration}} in issues of gender equality {{has a history}} spanning four decades. In recent years, the issue of gender equality in schools and preschools has received extensive attention. The reasons for this attention are one, {{that the development of}} Nordic societies has caused pressure to update gender equality laws to bring about equality and equity in schools; and two, that boys have begun to fall behind girls’ achievements academically in many western countries, drawing attention again to gender issues. Changes in legislation create pressure for educational professionals to develop their practices. However, gender-equality promotion practices vary considerably between Nordic countries and between regions of single countries. In this project, funded by the Nordic Council of Ministers, participants gathered and compared data on current ‘promising practices’ relating to gender equality promotion at schools and kindergartens in each Nordic country. This project identified the following as the most promising practices for furthering gender equality in education: one; gender mainstreaming in education, both in teaching and learning; two, gender equality planning at schools (GEP); three, recruiting gender equality educators to municipalities; four, creating a national or a Nordic gender-equality certificate for educational institutions to acquire; five, promoting gender balance and diversity among educational staff; and six, gender equality work with the parents of students. Each practice is itself an influential activity; together, these six practices present a systematic approach {{to the development of the}} organisation of education, and a comprehensive strategy for promoting gender equality in education. This project report aims to contribute discussion on the issues, ‘Can one speak of a ‘Nordic equality model’ in education?’ and, ‘How can Nordic countries benefit from a <b>joint</b> <b>gender</b> equality promotion?’ and ‘Can Nordic gender equality promotion be beneficial for non-European countries?...|$|R

30|$|Other {{factors such}} as <b>gender,</b> age, <b>funding,</b> and {{scientific}} equipment also play important roles in research productivity.

Older age has also been found to correspond with a decrease in research productivity (Stephan 1996; Stephan and Levin 1992); this is likely due to the fact that the profits following personal knowledge-based investment decline with advanced age. Researcher career and age tend to have an inverted U-shaped relationship, which reaches its peak at the early stageof the career (Baser and Pema 2004; Oster and Hamermesh 1998).|$|R

Our results show that mobile respondents from the Universities of Cambridge and Zurich have relatively different family trajectories and networks, but also more precarious academic paths, than their non-mobile counterparts.

We employ recent advances in quantile regression that allow its application to count data. Estimation of the model for a panel of biomedical and exact scientists at the KU Leuven in the period 1992 - 2001 shows strong support for our quantile regression approach, revealing the di¤erential impact of almost all regressors along the distribution.
