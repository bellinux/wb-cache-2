40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{the debate surrounding}} Prescott's (2004) theory in which he attributes the differences in working hours among the major industrialized nations to respective <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> the <b>tax</b> <b>systems</b> and public retirement programs. The validity of this argument for Japan is examined. Lacking a body of empirical research that tests assumptions regarding the elasticity of the aggregate labor supply in Japan, we cannot verify that this model applies to Japan. It is clear {{that in the case}} of Japan, the structure of incentives provided by various benefit programs has greater bearing than does the <b>tax</b> <b>system.</b> Furthermore, the model used in Prescott's paper considers only <b>in</b> general <b>tax</b> and public retirement programs, and is inappropriate in an analysis of working hours. The remedy for long working hours involves the issue of coordination, and it requires much more in-depth debate regarding the role that labor unions and government regulations do or should play. ...|$|R
40|$|The OECD Model Tax Convention {{contains}} a beneficial owner {{requirement for the}} taxation of dividend, interest and royalty income. The purpose of the requirement is to prevent improper use of tax treaties, and consequently counteract abusive treaty shopping structures that aim at gaining tax treaty benefits that would not otherwise be achievable. As the beneficial owner requirement {{is included in the}} OECD Model Tax Convention, it is consequently included <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> treaties that are concluded by Member States of the European Union. From the perspective of the EU law, the requirement may, however, constitute as a restriction on free movement. As there is not significant harmonization of direct taxation within the European Union, nationals of Member States are able to use the different <b>tax</b> <b>systems</b> of different Member States to minimize their tax burden by exercising the freedom of establishment. The structures that make use of the <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> the national <b>tax</b> <b>systems</b> of Member States can be view as abusive on national level, but they may be protected by the fundamental freedoms that the EU treaties provide for. Therefore, anti-abusive legislation that a Member State has introduced may create a restriction on free movement. The freedom of establishment ensures that a national of a Member States has the right to move freely within the EU without being subject to excessive measures, which are not applied in purely domestic but comparable situations. This gives an EU national the possibility to choose to establish an entity in a Member State where the taxation of dividend, interest and royalty income on source is most favourable for the <b>tax</b> payer. However, <b>in</b> order to invoke the freedom of establishment, the company in question must pursuit effective and genuine economic activities in the state of establishment. This thesis examines whether the structures that are used by Member State nationals to gain tax treaty benefits are protected by the EU law, and if the application of the beneficial ownership concept that is included <b>in</b> the <b>tax</b> treaties that are concluded between different Member States, is in fact against EU law, and particularly against the freedom of establishment. Furthermore, the thesis examines the potential justifications for the restriction that the beneficial ownership requirement might create on the freedom of establishment. The thesis aims to conclude how the beneficial ownership provisions <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> treaties should be interpreted so that the interpretation is essentially in compliance with EU law. When examining the case law of the European Court of Justice, it seems evident that the beneficial owner requirement can create a restriction on the freedom of establishment. Nevertheless, this restriction may be justified, to some extent, by the necessity to prevent tax avoidance. The European Court of Justice has developed in its practice a doctrine of abuse, under which the Member States are allowed to introduce national anti-abuse legislation to counteract tax avoidance. It is established in the case law of the European Court of Justice that while national anti-abusive legislation may create a restriction on the freedom of establishment, the restriction may be justified on the grounds of prevention of abusive practices. The national anti-abusive legislation must be, however, designed exclusively to prevent the use of wholly artificial arrangements, and therefore establishments that entail effective and genuine economic activities cannot be excluded from obtaining tax treaty benefits. Consequently, the beneficial owner requirement must be applied in such manner that it only excludes purely artificial arrangement from attaining the benefits of a tax treaty...|$|R

40|$|The {{provision}} of financial services {{has changed dramatically}} {{over the past two}} decades. Technological innovation and deregulation have extended providers' geographic range and broadened the array of products they are capable of delivering. These changes have intensified competition among financial service firms. In recent years Massachusetts, like other states, has passed legislation designed to narrow disparities among the tax burdens of these institutions. At the same time, the Commonwealth has passed tax cuts designed to enhance the competitiveness of Massachusetts-based financial institutions. Consequently, {{the degree to which the}} Commonwealth has actually leveled the tax playing field for them is unclear. This article attempts to resolve the issue. The author concludes that <b>tax</b> changes enacted <b>in</b> recent years have widened some <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> treatment of Massachusetts-based financial institutions while narrowing others. Tax burdens on most Massachusetts-based financial institutions have been reduced, enhancing their competitive standing vis-a`-vis their out-of-state rivals.

Combined with regional <b>disparities</b> <b>in</b> <b>tax</b> capacities and an inflexible local <b>tax</b> <b>system,</b> there is a large vertical fiscal gap in Japan between the central and local governments - a gap that necessitates the transfer of funds from central to local governments. Under this system, the fiscal adjustments in Japan's municipalities occur mainly via changes in government investment, and they account for 63 %- 95 % of adjustments in permanent unit innovations in grants and own-source revenue. In contrast to the role of expenditure, the municipalities' own-source revenue plays a limited role in balancing the local budget. The results of this study also reveal that 40 % of the increase in own-source revenue is offset by a reduction in grants. Furthermore, municipalities can induce grants by expanding government current expenditure. Finally, this study offers and discusses some policy implications...|$|R
