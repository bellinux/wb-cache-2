50|$|The <b>grizzled</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> is {{native to}} the {{tropical}} rainforests of northern and western New Guinea at elevations up to 1400 m above sea level.

5000|$|The IUCN {{lists the}} <b>grizzled</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> as [...] "Vulnerable". It is an {{uncommon}} animal and its population {{is believed to}} be declining though its range and numbers have not been well studied. It is hunted for food and for the pet trade by the indigenous people and its habitat is being lost as forest is cleared for small-scale agriculture and to make way for plantations of oil palm. The animals living in the northern coastal mountain range are particularly threatened, but there is a community initiative there focusing on conservation of tree kangaroos. The animal appears in Appendix II of CITES.|$|E
50|$|The Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo is the {{smallest}} of all tree-kangaroos. Its body and head length ranges about 48-65 cm, and its tail, 60-74 cm, with males weighing an average of 7.2 kg (16 lb) and females 5.9 kg (13 lb). The length of the Doria's tree-kangaroo is 51-78 cm, with a long 44-66 cm tail, and weighs 6.5-14.5 kg. The Matschie's tree-kangaroo has a body and head length of 81 cm (20 to 32 inches), adult males weigh 9-11 kg (20-25 lb) and adult females weigh 7-9 kg (15-20 lb). The <b>grizzled</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> grows to a length of 75-90 cm (30 to 35 in), with males being considerably larger than females, and its weight is 8-15 kg (18-33 lb).|$|E
50|$|The <b>grizzled</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> {{sometimes}} descends to {{the ground}} but spends most of its time in the forest canopy, as {{it is able to}} leap agilely from tree to tree. It sleeps on a horizontal branch and feeds on the leaves, fruits and bark of trees. The diet includes the leaves of Schuurmansiella angustifolia, Gnetum, Tetracera, Elatostema and arums and the leaves and fruit of fig trees. The reproduction of this tree kangaroo has been little studied but breeding seems to take place once a year with a single young remaining in the female's pouch for about nine months. Females with young have been observed in March, June and December and a single set of twins has been recorded.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grizzled</b> <b>tree-kangaroo</b> {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 75 to 90 cm with males being {{considerably}} larger than females. It resembles a terrestrial kangaroo and its weight varies between about 8 and 15 kg. The head is small, with a flat muzzle, the arms are powerful for climbing, the hind legs are long and the feet are large for an arboreal animal. The toes are armed with strong claws and the fourth toe is usually longer than the others. The otherwise bushy, cylindrical tail is often hairless at the base, and {{is used as a}} prop when climbing. Its colouring is between charcoal grey and chocolate brown with paler underparts. The ears are black and the toes and tail are dark.|$|E
