5|$|When Iselle made {{landfall}} on the Big Island with {{winds of}} 60mph (95km/h), {{it became the}} strongest tropical cyclone on record to hit the island, and {{one of only three}} storms to hit the island at tropical storm intensity or higher, along with Tropical Storm Seven in 1958, and Tropical Storm Darby in 2016. If Iselle had made landfall as a hurricane, {{it would have been the}} first hurricane to ever <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Island. With estimated damage cost of $79.2 million (2014USD), Iselle surpassed Hurricane Dot in 1959 as the third-costliest tropical cyclone to ever hit the U.S. state of Hawaii, even after accounting for inflation. The only storms to cause more damage to the islands were hurricanes Iniki and Iwa in 1992 and 1982, respectively. In addition, Iselle was the third-strongest tropical cyclone to ever make landfall on the Hawaiian islands after hurricanes Dot and Iniki.|$|E

25|$|Minder is a British comedy-drama {{about the}} London {{criminal}} underworld. Initially produced by Verity Lambert, {{it was made}} by Euston Films, a subsidiary of Thames Television and shown on ITV (originally by Thames, then Central Independent Television in 1993 and 1994 after Thames lost its franchise). The original show ran for ten series between 29 October 1979 and 10 March 1994. The series was notable for using a range of leading British actors, {{as well as many}} up-and-coming performers before they <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> time; at its peak it was one of ITV's biggest ratings winners.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{match was}} between The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von), and Big Show and Kane for the Dudley Boyz's WWF Tag Team Championship. Kane {{dominated}} in the beginning, and tagged in The Big Show. The Big Show also dominated, {{but as he}} attempted a chokeslam, Bubba Ray held the ropes and raked the eyes of The Big Show. D-Von tagged in but received a sidewalk slam from The Big Show. The Big Show then hit D-Von {{with a series of}} hip attacks. Kane and The Big Show dominated in the ring, knocking the Dudleys out of the ring. Kane went to the top rope and jumped to the outside, knocking out Dudleys. In the ring, Stacy Keibler tried to encourage the Dudleys, but The Big Show snuck up and pulled down her skirt. The Dudleys hit Kane with a double suplex and started working on him. They gave Kane a diving headbutt low blow, and a series of double-team maneuvers. They set him for the Dudley Death Drop but Kane kicked D-Von in the head and hit Bubba Ray with a clothesline. Kane tagged in The Big Show, who tried to chokeslam D-Von but Bubba Ray hit him a chop block. Kane tried to hit D-Von with a flying clothesline but accidentally <b>hit</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Show. Dudleys fell to the outside while Kane and Show argued in the ring. The Dudleys then <b>hit</b> <b>The</b> <b>Big</b> Show with a Hotshot onto an exposed turnbuckle for the win, retaining their title.|$|E
25|$|Ashraful went {{on after}} lunch, making 42 before a slower ball from Fernando ended his 43-run stand with Aftab Ahmed, and after that, wickets fell quickly. Muttiah Muralitharan added three to his series tally, which now stood at 12, and eight people {{were caught in}} the Bangladeshi innings, which lasted 45.4 overs. It would have been even less but for a {{determined}} half-hour between Mashud and Enamul - the pair added 25 in 9 overs before Mashud was stumped shortly after tea. Bangladesh were asked to follow on, and once again gave up catches - Nafees Iqbal had been promoted to opener, and made 30 quickly, before giving up a leg side catch to Sangakkara. Earlier, Javed Omar and Habibul Bashar had been out to expansive shots for low scores, and once again it was down to Ashraful. He recorded 21 runs in the evening session, at an unusually slow pace, while Shahriar Nafees were left to <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> shots, taking eight fours off the Sri Lankan bowlers as he moved to 51. Two balls before the close of play, however, he edged to Samaraweera at slip, giving Muralitharan another wicket, and Bangladesh closed on 131 for 4, still 135 short of Sri Lanka's first innings score.|$|E
500|$|According to Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{although}} [...] "Keep It Together" [...] sonically {{pays tribute to}} Sly and the Family Stone, the lyrics talk about the realization of how important Madonna's family has been {{as a form of}} stability in her life, especially in the line [...] "Brothers and sisters, They've always been there for me, We have a connection, Home is where the heart should be". The lyrics follow the course of Madonna's rise from figuratively being a [...] "hungry sibling" [...] ("I'm gonna leave this place, So I can forget every single hungry face") to being a superstar ("I <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> time but I still get the blues, Everyone's a stranger, City life can get to you").|$|E

Despite {{the fact that the}} board was now more random (host Todd Newton called it [...] "Larson-proof"), {{and there was no way}} the same trick could have been performed, Long and Litras (who had remarried and took the surname Litras-Dakan) still lost. When James Larson <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Bank space on his first spin of the first round, Long proceeded to joke with host Newton that he had [...] "seen this before". At one point, Litras-Dakan advanced to first place before hitting a Double Whammy shortly afterward, effectively giving James Larson the win. James Larson won a digital grand piano worth $6,695, while Newton closed the game by announcing, [...] "The legacy continues".|$|E

6000|$|Swiftly {{that winter}} passed. Pan had a happy growing time of it. Study had not seemed so irksome, perhaps {{owing to the}} fact that he had a horse and saddle; he could ride to and fro; he often stopped to see Lucy who was now big enough to want to go to school herself; and the teacher had won his love. Pan kept out of fights with Dick Hardman until one recess when Dick called him [...] "teacher's pet." [...] That {{inflamed}} Pan, as much because of the truth of it as the shame. So this time, though he had hardly picked a fight, he was the first to strike. With surprising suddenness he <b>hit</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> Dick square on the nose. When Dick got up howling and swearing, his face was hideous with dirt and blood. Then began a battle that dwarfed the one in the barn. Pan had grown considerably. He was quick and strong, and when once his mother's fighting blood burned in him he was as fierce as a young savage. But again Dick whipped him.|$|E
