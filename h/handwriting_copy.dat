40|$|Two {{studies were}} carried out in order to better {{understand}} the role of perceptual and visuo-motor skills in handwriting. Two training programs, visual-haptic (VH) and visual (V), were compared which differed in the way children explored the letters. The results revealed that improvements of VH training on letter recognition and handwriting quality were higher than improvements after V training. We suppose that VH training was more efficient because it improved both perceptual and visuo-motor skills. In the second experiment, in order to investigate the part of each component, we assessed the link between visuo-motor skills, perceptual skills and handwriting. The results showed that only the visuo-motor tasks predict <b>handwriting</b> <b>copying</b> performance. These results are discussed in relation to the respective roles of the perceptual and visuo-motor skills on letter shape learning and handwriting movement execution...|$|R

Christensen (2004) points out a significant correlation between the automaticity to perform graphic skills {{and the production of}} creative quality texts. The difficulties to perform writing and drawing patterns have been also associated with learning problems in general (e.g. Berninger et al. 1997; Jones and Christensen 1999), and for young learners, the problems are also related to letter formation and reading (Graham and Harris 2005; Vander Hart et al. 2010). Bearing in mind that children with handwriting difficulties are prone to have their ability to learn minimized in various dimensions (Coates and Coates 2006), the understanding of how children acquire handwriting skills is of a practical value for school teaching. For instance, Bara and Gentaz (2013) designed two instruction programs for handwriting, one based on visual inspection of letters and another involving visual as well as haptic exploration of letters. After five sessions they found that 5  year-old children {{who took part in the}} visual-haptic instruction program perform better in <b>handwriting</b> <b>copying</b> tasks than those children who experienced only visual inspection.|$|R

5|$|Evidence {{uncovered}} after Lie's {{death in}} 1912 suggested that Siti Akbari was {{heavily influenced by}} the earlier Sjair Abdoel Moeloek (1847), variously credited to Raja Ali Haji or Saleha. This tale was transliterated by Arnold Snackey, then later translated into Sundanese. Sources disagree on the translator. The documentarian Christiaan Hooykaas, writing {{in a letter to}} literary critic Nio Joe Lan, suggested that Lie's inspiration had come from a version of Sjair Abdoel Moeloek held in the Royal Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences Library in Batavia. Biographer Tio Ie Soei, meanwhile, suggested that the version which inspired Lie was translated in 1873 by Lie's teacher, Sierk Coolsma. According to Tio, Coolsma had based his translation off a stage performance and written it hurriedly, such that it was nearly illegible. As he had better <b>handwriting,</b> Lie purportedly <b>copied</b> the story for Coolsma and kept the original in his own collection.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the handwriting characteristics of secondary school students with and without physical disabilities (PD). With the use of a computerized Chinese Handwriting Assessment Tool (CHAT), it was made possible to objectively assess and analyze in detail the handwriting characteristics of individual students. Fifty participants (age range: 15 - 19 -years-old) were recruited from one mainstream secondary school and 20 participants (age range: 17 - 24 -years-old) were recruited from two secondary schools for students with PD. They were asked to perform three consecutive <b>handwriting</b> tasks: <b>copying</b> 90 characters using the computerized CHAT, an English passage copying task, and a Chinese passage copying task. The data indicated that students with PD were significantly slower in copying both Chinese and English characters in passages when compared to the typical students. Significant differences in the measures of writing speed, air/ground time ratio, standard deviation of speed, standard deviation of size per character, and number of stroke errors measured by the CHAT were found between the two groups of students. Further analysis on the data of typical students indicated no significant difference in handwriting speed among students of different classes (i. e. arts or science) on copying Chinese and English passages, and on individual Chinese words (from CHAT). The academic results of students also showed no significant correlation with their handwriting speed measured by the three writing tasks. To conclude, the CHAT system was able to identify a number of characteristics of handwriting on students with and without PD. It was suggested that the CHAT should further be developed into an objective evaluation tool to explore the handwriting characteristics of the students with a wider range of disabilities in the future, and to make recommendations to arrange special examination arrangements (SEA) for students with physical disabilities or other special needs.

Eight subjects of different age groups took part in the pilot test. The method was based on a comparison of the personal immediate <b>handwriting</b> performance in <b>copying</b> the graphical patterns. The performance of the subjects in game-like testing was evaluated in terms of the stylus deviation and correlation of the scan path to the graph on X-axis and Y-axis separately and the task completion time when output-to-input ratio was non-less than 4. The results of a pilot testing are analyzed. They reveal that coordination problems can be registered even when the problems have not previously been detected by the person himself. We guess that further exploration of the pen-based technique for screening hand-eye coordination problems can increase selective sensitivity of the method regarding verified symptoms of neurological problems.

40|$|I deal in {{this paper}} with a text that still remains little {{discussed}} in Australia, but whose far-reaching importance is now becoming relevant to Hellenists with very different specialisations.

Remains of {{the top half of}} a papyrus role, with 26 columns part-extant. It was found in 1962, and published in an unauthorised version in 1982, but the early columns that were in need of painstaking reconstruction were published only in 1997 (Tsantsanoglou 1997). New texts have been published since 2002, including the official version of 2006. At the present time it is being read with promising new multi-spectral imaging that can clear up some uncertainties, and I am fortunate enough to have seen some of what this technique can achieve with the papyrus.

Semarang. Faculty of Humanities of Diponegoro University. Advisor I Nur Fauzan Ahmad, S. S., M. A. Advisor II Drs. M. Muzakka, M. Hum. Naẓam Samḥiyyah (NS) is a {{manuscript}} containing {{the teachings of}} Jumat (Friday) prayer by KH. Ahmad Rifa'i. This script was found by the writer at the residence of KH. Amrudin Nasichun located in Paesan Tengah village, Kedungwuni district of Pekalongan. There {{are two kinds of}} the script; <b>handwriting</b> and <b>copied</b> version. This research aimed to explain some descriptions, text editing as well as the translation of NS and describe the teaching of Jumat prayer by KH. Ahmad Rifa'i contained in it along with the values behind the teaching. To achieve these goals it was used two kinds of theories, philological and content analysis. The philological analysis was done through the stages of description, comparison, transliteration, text editing, and translation. On the other hand, the content analysis was applied within three procedures including data procurement, inference process and analysis, and validity and reliability tests. 	The Jumat prayer teaching by KH. Ahmad Rifa'i in NS included two main topics, namely the legitimacy of Jumat prayer established by four people and the roles of ulama alim adil (fair and knowledgeable scholars) in fulfilling the legitimacy of Jumat prayer. The validity of Jumat prayer with four people was taught by KH. Ahmad Rifa'i based on several reasons, i. e. for the mercy of the shari'a (Islamic rules), obedience (taklid) toward the opinion of Imam Shafi'i, as well as the fulfillment of Islamic pillars and requirements. Meanwhile, the roles of ulama alim adil in achieving the legitimacy of Jumat prayer included teaching the Jumat prayer itself, witnessing and declaring the validity of Jumat prayers, as well as eliminating disputes and differences among people related to the number of people establishing Jumat prayer. The content analysis conducted by the writer revealed that the teaching contained some messages in the form of educational and religious values. The educational value stated the importance of seeking knowledge, while the religious one defined the importance of following the scholars in the worship.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{experiment}} {{was to investigate the}} role of visual feedback during written composition. Effects of suppression of visual feedback were analysed both on processing demands and on on-line coordination of low-level execution processes and of high-level conceptual and linguistic processes. Writers composed a text and copied it either with or without visual feedback. Processing demands of the writing processes were evaluated with reaction times to secondary auditory probes that were analysed according to whether participants were handwriting (in a composing and a copying tasks) or engaged in high level processes (when pausing in a composing task). Suppression of visual feedback increased reaction times interference (secondary reaction time minus baseline reaction time) during <b>handwriting</b> in the <b>copying</b> task and not during pauses in the composing task. This suggests that suppression of visual feedback affected processing demands of only execution processes and not those of high-level conceptual and linguistic processes. This is confirmed by analysis of quality of the texts produced by participants that were little, if any, affected by the suppression of visual feedback. Results also indicate that the increase in processing demands of execution related to suppression of visual feedback affected on-line coordination of the writing processes. Indeed, when visual feedback was suppressed, reaction time interferences associated to handwriting were not reliable different in the copying task and in the composing task but were significantly different in the composition task, RT interference associated to handwriting being lower in the copying task than in the composition task. When visual feedback was suppressed, writers activated step-by-step execution processes and high-level writing processes, whereas they concurrently activated these writing processes when composing with visual feedback...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The primary {{aim of this}} {{research}} study was to establish whether a relationship exists between the visual-motor integration subtest when measured with the Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test of Visual Motor Integration, 4 th edition, and the copying and eye-hand coordination subtests, when measured with the Developmental Test of Visual Perception, 2 nd edition. The secondary aim of {{this research}} study was to establish whether handedness and gender {{have an effect on}} the relationship between these three perceptual-motor skills. Method: This retrospective cross-sectional study used retrospective data collected over a four-year-period, between 2009 and 2012, at a private occupational therapy practice in Tshwane East. The total sample size consisted of 106 participants that were referred for occupational therapy evaluations during the time period. The sample was divided into subgroups for grade, handedness and gender. Multivariable regression analysis was used to establish whether a relationship exists between visual-motor integration, copying and eye-hand coordination. Random-effects generalised least squares regression analysis was used to establish the effect of handedness and gender on the relationship between visual-motor integration, eye-hand coordination and copying. Results: Results indicated reasonable agreement between the subtests of visual-motor integration and copying. Poor agreement was established between the subtests of visual-motor integration and eye-hand coordination, and the subtests of copying and eye-hand coordination. Statistically significant relationships were established between visual-motor integration, eye-hand coordination and copying for the total sample and subgroups of Grade R and Grade 1. Shared variance of 52. 1 % was established between the visual-motor integration and the copying subtest. The relationship between visual-motor integration and eye-hand coordination weakened for Grade 1 participants. This was also observed in the relationship between copying and eye-hand coordination. No statistically significant results were obtained for handedness and gender with regard to the relationships between visual-motor integration, eye-hand coordination and copying. Conclusions: The results of the study indicated the importance of using all three subtests during occupational therapy evaluations. In view of the statistically significant relationships that were found to exist, the tests proved mutually supportive during occupational therapy evaluations. The negative relationship between visual-motor integration and eye-hand coordination for Grade 1 participants may be related to handwriting competency. Handedness and gender differences could not be related to the three perceptual-motor subtests. Limitations: Firstly, the study population and study setting posed limitations toward generalisability. Secondly, the retrospective study design proved some limitations pertaining to the measurement instruments, data collection tools and re-scoring of the measurement instruments. Recommendations: For more meaningful interpretations the study population should include children without developmental or school-related difficulties. This would aid toward better generalisability. A retrospective study design should be selected with caution.

In the document, a narrative titled ‘Snow’ draws the story of how unknown celebrities are forced into an ugly entertainment industry.” The newscast cited the documents, stating, “The police who were investigating Jang Ja-yeon’s case knew of this fact but chose to overlook it. Jang Ja-yeon asked for ‘revenge’ in the document.” They added, “Jang Ja-yeon entertained a total of 31 people, 100 times - being forced to give sexual favors. However, claims by representative Kim from her past agency reveals a completely different story. Jang Ja-yeon had kept records of their jobs however, and within these records, it is supposed that officials, publisher officials, corporations, financial institutions, and media officials are involved.” Also, “A handwriting expert has confirmed that the documents belonged to Jang Ja-yeon.” the newscast revealed, “Jang Ja-yeon wrote, ‘Please get revenge. There is no way out of hosting. The men who come to receive services are evil. I was forced to host over 100 times. Whenever I get new clothes to wear, I had to meet another devil. Not just in Kangnam, but I also hosted at Suwon Karaoke and various room salons. Even on my parents’ memorial day, I was forced to host. Since I made a list, avenge me to the death. Even if I die, I will take my revenge to the grave.’”. however the National Institute of Scientific Investigation said that the letters were fabricated. they said:“In these letters, the way that certain characters like ‘yo’ and ‘ya’ were written coincide directly with the writing habits of the late actress Jang Ja-yeon. The way the consonants and vowels were written are exactly alike, proving that these letters were written by the same person.” SBS further added, “It is virtually impossible for Jun to have perfected the handwriting of Jang Ja-yeon by copying the picture of her suicide note from a newspaper. He could not have written 230 letters in her <b>copied</b> <b>handwriting</b> with such limited information, and it is also unlikely that three years worth of letters were merely the result of a concocted plan.” SBS continued, “The letters also reveal detailed information regarding her agency’s advancement plans, as well as information on the figures she ‘hosted’ that others {{would not be able to}} know. If anything, the letters and envelopes show that Jun tried his best to make sure that Jang Ja-yeon’s identity was not leaked through the letters.”. however the National Forensic Service confirms that Jang Ja-yeon’s letters were fabricated. Yang Hoo-yeol the chief of the NFS opened an official briefing with the media and reported, “After comparing Jang Ja-yeon’s original handwriting to Jun’s handwriting and the letters in question, results have shown that the letters are not in line with Jang Ja-yeon’s original handwriting. Many of grammatical errors are in line with the mistakes Jun made in his personal letters, so we believe that Jang Ja-yeon’s letters were fabricated by Jun.” He concluded, “The letters that Jun claimed were sent to him by Jang Ja Yeon have a completely different handwriting style to Jang Ja Yeon’s original handwriting. Jang Ja Yeon did not write these letters.”. SBS responded to the reports made by the National Forensic Service yesterday, in which they asserted that Jang Ja-yeon‘s letters were indeed fabricated. SBS stated, “We have no option but to accept the results declared by the NSF. We felt that we had gone through all of the correct measures in investigating the letters for our reports, so we are apologetic for reporting something that was not revealed to be the truth.” The station went on to explain their process for their findings. “We made a detailed comparison of the court records and the content of the letters and decided that the possibility of Jang Ja-yeon having written the letters herself was high. We did not, however, investigate the documents at the time.” SBS continued, “When we commissioned a handwriting analysis, results showed that it belonged to Jang. We had met with Jun, the owner of the letters, twice already, and even met with his family. His family revealed that they had not directly confirmed that the celebrity Jun knew was Jang Ja-yeon, just that he had a celebrity friend. We then decided that it would be impossible for an inmate to accurately record the whereabouts of someone else outside for over three years.” “As it stands, we have no option but to accept the results of the NFS.” The 8 News concluded with an apology to the viewers. “We are extremely apologetic towards the viewers for adding confusion, and to the bereaved for causing distress. We will be continuing to work to find the truth behind Jang Ja-yeon’s controversy.”.|$|R
