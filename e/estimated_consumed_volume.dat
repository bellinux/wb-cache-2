Study focusOne significant activity in Laguna province is the development of the water resorts which includes hot springs resorts and spas. Presence of hot springs is due to the geothermal activities in the area. This study seeks to explore the nature and possible impacts of groundwater utilization in hot spring resorts in Calamba and Los Baños in Laguna Province. This study also analyzes the issues and challenges in the implementation of policies and laws to regulate water use in these resorts. New hydrological insights for the regionThese water resorts are <b>estimated</b> to <b>consume</b> large <b>volume</b> of groundwater which could result to over-extraction and decrease in groundwater quantity. However, monitoring and regulation of usage is difficult as most of these resorts operate without water use permits. If groundwater use is left unregulated, water availability for the resorts industry and for domestic, commercial and other uses in the future will be negatively affected. It is necessary to strengthen implementation of laws and enhance partnerships among national and local government agencies, private sector, civil society and communities, in the proper monitoring and regulation of groundwater resources to promote sustainability...|$|R

40|$|This paper heuristically tackles a {{challenging}} scheduling problem arising in the eld of hydraulic distribution systems {{in case of}} a contamination event, that is, optimizing the scheduling of a set of tasks so that the <b>consumed</b> <b>volume</b> of contaminated water is minimized. Each task consists of manually activating a given device, located on the hydraulic network of the water distribution system. In practice, once contamination has been detected, a given number of response teams move along the network to operate each device on site. The <b>consumed</b> <b>volume</b> of contaminated water depends on the time at which each device is operated, according to complex hydraulic laws, so that the value associated to each schedule must be evaluated by a hydraulic simulation. We explore the potentials of Genetic Algorithms as a viable tool for tackling this optimization-simulation problem. We compare different encodings and propose ad hoc crossover operators that exploit the combinatorial structure of the feasible region, featuring hybridization with Mixed Integer Linear Programming. Extensive computational results are provided for a real life hydraulic network of average size, showing the effectiveness of the approach. Indeed, we greatly improve upon common sense inspired solutions which are commonly adopted in practice...|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{health risk}} caused by As {{exposure}} {{in drinking water}} {{is important to understand}} the impact of As contaminated drinking water and to prioritize the interventions. We characterized the As contamination and assessed health risk related to As contaminated water in Duy Tien district, Hanam province using the Australian Environmental Health Risk Assessment Framework. Exposure assessment was conducted by measuring As concentrations in 300 tube-well water samples before and after filtration, <b>estimating</b> water <b>volume</b> <b>consumed</b> for drinking purpose in 150 interviewed households, which gave the daily consumption dose from oral route. Health risk was characterized by comparing the As levels in water with the National technical regulations on drinking water quality, and by comparing the daily consumption dose with the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) value set by WHO. Finally, cancer risk of people using As contaminated water source for eating and drinking was estimated using Cancer Slope Factor index and lifetime average daily dose. Results showed that water was heavily contaminated with As. The concentrations in drinking water before filtration were from 8 – 579 ppb (mean 301 ppb). The majority of households designed their sand filters themselves, but filters did not meet the standard for As removal. As daily consumptions of 60 % adults were lower than the level of the TDI (1 µg/kg/day). The average cancer risk in adults due to consuming filtered tube-well water for drinking purpose was 23. 5 x 10 - 5. This cancer risk would be 1. 2 and 1. 5 times higher after five and 10 years drinking filtered water, respectively. Our study showed the high contamination levels of As in tube-well water in Hanam. Improved filtration measures or the replacement of the current drinking water source (i. e. by rain water, clean pipe water [...] .) to prevent health risk for local population are recommended...|$|R

While the main {{advantage of the}} resealability feature {{is its ability to}} reclose the package in order to extend the shelf life of the food product inside, the present research’s aim is to assess whether this advantage also has implications for palatable, energy-dense food consumption. Two studies provide intentional as well as behavioral evidence for the claim that consumers are better able to self-regulate their consumption and thus eat less in one occasion when a palatable, energy-dense food product is offered in a resealable (vs. unresealable) package. A third study investigates the effect of package resealability across multiple consumption occasions and reveals that the resealability feature limits the <b>volume</b> <b>consumed</b> on each occasion (conditional on consumption incidence) while it does not accelerate consumption frequency, resulting in a lower total <b>consumed</b> <b>volume</b> of palatable, energy-dense snacks over a six-day period.

40|$|Sugarcane {{cultivation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important agricultural activities in Brazil, and is developed since sixteenth century. The production of sugarcane is showing nowadays a rapid expansion, mainly due to the growth of ethanol production, especially over areas of conventional crops. Sugarcane straw burning causes several impacts that affect soil and crop productivity. Thus remote sensing products have been used as an information source for estimation of burned vegetation and emissions released during the combustion process. The objective of this study is to use fire radiative power (FRP) and fire radiative energy (FRE) to estimate the amount of biomass consumed in sugarcane straw burning, through a small-scale combustion experiment occurred in Radiometry Laboratory of the National Institute for Space Research. The multiplicative coefficient determined with the thermal camera was 0. 534 kg.

40|$|The {{difference}} between the found value and the real value {{is known as the}} absolute error. When applied to a titration, the absolute error comes from the {{difference between}} the real amount of analyte present in the sample and the amount of it calculated from the titration data (namely, the titrant volume at the endpoint and the titrant molarity). In most cases, the true amount of analyte is a statistical problem. In titrations, the relative error is minimized when endpoint and stoichiometric point (both in terms of <b>consumed</b> <b>volume</b> of titrant) are very close to each other. More widely used is the percent relative error (PRE). In this exercise, a volumetric titration is carried out using a visual indicator to determine the endpoint. The analyst must stop titration just at the moment the titrated solution changes color. From the titrant volume required and data about the analyzed problem, the percent relative error should be calculated. When overtitration occurs, the error value becomes significant...|$|R

40|$|Reconstructing diet in Andean populations is {{complicated}} by ecological complexity and by large-scale population movements and trade networks {{during the period of}} imperial rule. It is therefore more difficult to reconstruct dietary patterns within these contexts. Previous multi-isotopic analysis of the skeletal population from the Inca site of Machu Picchu indicates marked variation in dietary composition both early and late in life. However, these data are limited in their specificity due to overlap in isotopic signals from different resource types. I compare existing isotopic data to enamel macro- and microwear data to more accurately profile diet composition in a Machu Picchu skeletal population subset. Results suggest there is little to no dietary variation between sexes and age groups. Results also reveal the role that maize played in the diet of this non-elite population, which may prove useful in more accurately <b>estimating</b> <b>consumed</b> food resources in this and other Andean populations...|$|R
40|$|Many {{parallel}} Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms adopt multiple stages architecture {{to increase}} performance. However, data permutation between stages <b>consumes</b> <b>volume</b> memory and processing time. An FFT array processing mapping {{algorithm is proposed}} in this paper to overcome this demerit. In this algorithm, arbitrary 2 k butterfly units (BUs) could be scheduled to work in parallel on n= 2 s data (k= 0, 1, …, s- 1). Because no inter stage data transfer is required, memory consumption is reduced to 1 / 3 of the original algorithm. Moreover, with the increasing of BUs, not only does throughput increase linearly, system latency also decreases linearly. This array processing orientated architecture provides flexible tradeoff between hardware cost and system performance. An 18 -bit word-length 1024 -point FFT architecture with 4 BUs is given to demonstrate this mapping algorithm. The design is implemented with TSMC 0. 18 µm CMOS technology. The core area is 2. 99 × 1. 12 mm 2 and clock frequency is 326 MHz in typical condition (1. 8 V, 25 ºC). This processor could complete 1024 FFT calculation in 7. 839 µs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Reliability {{concerns}} in state-of-the-art electronic systems have led researchers and engineers to develop innovative real-time prognostics and adaptive health management methods to assure desired availability. Prognostics techniques described here use a novel concept of canaries, along with data analysis, failure mechanism models and integrated fusion techniques {{to determine the}} remaining useful life of a system. A canary is a device that provides data to generate early warning of functional degradation and impending functional failure. Three types of canaries are discussed. Expendable canaries experience accelerated degradation (compared to functional degradation) by design, so that early warning of impending failure can be generated. Sensory canaries provide early warning by observing nonfunctional manifestation of functional degradation.

40|$|The aim of a {{volumetric}} titration is to {{find the}} analyte concentration from the <b>consumed</b> <b>volume</b> of titrant and its molarity. For calculations, the use of stoichiometric factors is compulsory if the concentration is expressed in moles/liter. When analyte and titrant react with each other during the titration, the stoichiometric factor is just the stoichiometric coefficients ratio for both in the chemical equation. It happens so in the titration of HCl with sodium carbonate. Sometimes, analyte and titrant take part in a chain of reactions in which the former is chemically converted to a titrable species. This is the case of Cu(II) titration with thiosulfate: Cu(II) ions react first with excess iodide to yield I 2 which is titrated with a thiosulfate solution of known molarity. In these instances, a relationship between the moles of analyte and moles of titrant should be established as the stoichiometric factor. In this exercise, the data from a volumetric titration are converted finally to mass percent of analyte in the sample. It is solved by dragging and dropping pieces (expressing concepts) on a complete stoichiometric equation which returns amount of mass every time a chemical meaning product is set up...|$|R
