5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> trade coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E

5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> carry out.|$|E

Of the patients who stated that they would pay out-of-pocket for the procedure, the median (IQR) amount they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>was</b> $ 750.00 (1500.00). Moreover, when {{patients were}} asked if they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> travel outside of Canada and pay out-of-pocket to have an ACLR, 41 (16.4 %) said yes, 151 (60.4 %) said no, and 58 (23.2 %) said that they were unsure. If patients stated they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay to travel outside of Canada to have the procedure performed, the median (IQR) amount they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for this option was $ 2500.00 (3750.00). Further, patients who <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> travel outside of Canada for an expedited ACLR <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay a median (IQR) amount of $ 2000.00 (2000.00) out-of-pocket to have the procedure done in Canada, whereas patients who were unwilling to travel outside of Canada <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay $ 600.00 (625.00) out-of-pocket to have the procedure done in Canada, and this difference was statistically significant (p[*]<[*] 0.000).

40|$|Abstract: This survey {{investigated}} {{the willingness to}} pay for an improved water quality and reliability in Chobe ward in Maun. On average, 54 % of the households <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for improved water quality. It is therefore apparent that Chobe Ward, Maun residents in general regard water as an economic good as they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for its provision. Those with a higher income <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for an improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand for an improved environmental quality increases with income. The older the person the more they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for improved water quality and reliability. Larger families <b>are</b> not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for an improved provision of water services. Also, educated people <b>are</b> lesser <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for improved water quality and reliability...|$|R

He even {{goes so far as to}} murder his own ailing father and frame the Imperial senators, to put an end to their scheming against himself and Larsa, and to level cities in nethicite testing experiments. Vayne's ultimate goal is to free humanity from the control of the Occurians, a race of god-like beings that have for centuries secretly meddled with the course of human history.|$|E
5|$|Ideally, {{these social}} skills become {{incorporated}} into the internal working model {{to be used with}} other children and later with adult peers. As children move into the school years at about six years old, most develop a goal-corrected partnership with parents, in which each partner <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> compromise in order to maintain a gratifying relationship. By middle childhood, the goal of the attachment behavioural system has changed from proximity to the attachment figure to availability. Generally, a child is content with longer separations, provided contact—or the possibility of physically reuniting, if needed—is available. Attachment behaviours such as clinging and following decline and self-reliance increases. By middle childhood (ages 7–11), there may be a shift toward mutual coregulation of secure-base contact in which caregiver and child negotiate methods of maintaining communication and supervision as the child moves toward a greater degree of independence.|$|E

Some time later, Scully attends a hearing, where her testimony is disregarded and the evidence covered up.

On 28 April 2007, the Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. BCHR issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards migrant workers. Rajab, then BCHR vice president, said: It is appalling that Bahrain <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> rest on the benefits of these people’s hard work, and often their suffering, but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity. The solution is not to force migrant workers into ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them.|$|E

In response, the show's creators expanded his role in the series, upgrading him to a main cast member in the fifth and sixth seasons.
