500|$|For Tasmania, Gervase Du Croz and Marshall {{opened the}} batting to the fast roundarm bowling of Lister and Hamilton. They batted for an hour—described {{in the press}} as {{displaying}} [...] "brilliant steady batting"—without being dismissed, at which point, with the score at 25, a lunch break was taken. After the interval, they maintained their partnership for another 30 minutes before Antill, who had replaced Hamilton in the bowling attack, bowled Du Croz; he had scored 27 in 93 minutes and the partnership was worth 40 runs. William Field, who replaced Du Croz, was bowled by the first ball he faced. The new man, George Maddox, scored a single from his first ball; Marshall was then caught at point, having batted 105 minutes for 13 runs. Antill had taken three wickets in four balls. Maddox was bowled by Antill after scoring one, then Hamilton bowled George Gibson for eight. Walter Westbrook, the next man in, survived for forty minutes but struggled to score, only managing three scoring shots in that time before Antill bowled him. Wickets fell steadily: Charles Arthur, bowled by Antill, scored one; John Tabart, bowled by Hamilton, scored two, and Henty was bowled by Antill for a duck. The last batsman, McDowall, batted effectively to score ten runs before he was caught by Antill at mid-on off Hamilton's bowling. Vincent Giblin remained not out, having batted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> for seven runs. The Van Diemen's Land innings ended for 104, a lead of 22 over Port Phillip, after 160 minutes and 32 overs. Antill had taken seven wickets for 33 runs while Hamilton took three for 24. Before the match, the Tasmanians had been expected to struggle against the overarm attack of the Victorians, and Antill had performed effectively; yet the Tasmanians were helped by a large total of 24 extras (which included 11 byes and eight no-balls).|$|E

She called me one day and asked if she could bring her sister along with her onto location. I said, 'Sure, of course, no problem.' And I was delighted because she was going out {{with the head of the}} studio. She could have been the biggest pain in the ass alive. And I would be in a terribly awkward position if she started with the limousines and the special means and whatever the hell it is—or complaining about whatever. But never a peep out of her. Most pleasant, most charming, very cooperative, very hard-working. She was always there half an hour before her call and she always stayed on <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> just in case.

2500|$|In 1984, Westheimer began hosting several {{television}} {{programs on the}} Lifetime (TV Network) and one in syndication. Her first show was Good Sex! With Dr. Ruth Westheimer, airing <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> at 10pm on weeknights. This show was expanded in 1985 to a full hour and its name was changed to The Dr. Ruth Show. In 1987, she began a separate half hour syndicated series on many broadcast stations called, Ask Dr. Ruth, which was co-hosted by Larry Angelo. Dr. Ruth returned to the Lifetime network in 1988 with The All New Dr. Ruth Show, which was followed in 1989 by two teen advice shows called What's Up, Dr. Ruth? and a call-in show, You're on the Air with Dr. Ruth in 1990. In 1993, Westheimer and Israeli TV host, Arad Nir, hosted a talk show in Hebrew, titled Min Tochnit, on the newly opened Israeli Channel 2. The show was similar to her US Sexually Speaking show. The name of the show, Min Tochnit, is a play of words: literally [...] "Kind of a program", but [...] "Min" [...] (מין) in Hebrew also means [...] "sex" [...] and [...] "gender".|$|E

2500|$|Events {{elsewhere}} forced Fairless' hand. [...] On Saturday, January 9, 1937, CIO president John L. Lewis had {{a chance}} encounter with U.S. Steel chairman Myron C. Taylor {{in the dining room}} at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C. The two men talked animatedly at a table <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour,</b> then met secretly at the Mayflower over the next two days. Beginning February 17, the two men met secretly for two weeks at Taylor's Upper East Side townhouse in New York City. On Sunday, March 1, Lewis met with Murray, CIO general counsel Lee Pressman, and Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America president Sidney Hillman and told them that Taylor had just signed an agreement agreeing to recognize SWOC as a labor union representing workers at U.S. Steel; bargain collectively with SWOC; establish grievance and seniority procedures; grant an across-the-board wage increase; establish a five-day, eight-hour workwork; and grant time-and-a-half for overtime. Lewis told Murray to appear in Fairless' office on Monday morning, where an agreement would be signed. [...] Murray and Fairless met on March 2, and a recognition agreement was signed that day. Negotiations on additional terms of the agreement began between Fairless and Murray on March 13, and a one-year agreement reached four days later that provided for seniority rights; a week of paid vacation for any worker with more than five years of seniority; two weeks' notice of dismissal; arbitration of grievances; a no-strike clause; and a clause guaranteeing employer neutrality during union elections.|$|E
2500|$|Going {{along with}} the tour's satirical theme of consumerism, U2 {{announced}} their tour on 12 February 1997 by holding {{a news conference at}} a Kmart discount store in New York City. [...] Hundreds of reporters from record companies, radio stations, television networks, newspapers, and magazines were in attendance at the conference, whose location was not revealed until the night before. Upon their arrival at the store, U2 got up on the stage assembled in the store's lingerie department, and performed [...] "Holy Joe", a B-side from the [...] "Discothèque" [...] single, which had been released nine days prior. [...] The entire event was broadcast live through various sources on television, radio, and the Internet. [...] Following the performance, the band answered questions <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour.</b> [...] It was announced that the beginning of the PopMart Tour was to feature stadium shows in 62 cities throughout North America and Europe, beginning in Whitney, Nevada, on 25 April, and ending in Seattle, Washington, on 12 December. [...] They would tour an additional 12 cities in 1998 throughout Africa, Asia, Australia, and South America. [...] Tickets went on sale for the announced dates several days after the tour's announcement, and were priced at an average of $50 worldwide. [...] Due to the lack of sponsors for the tour, ticket prices were almost 50% higher for this tour than Zoo TV. [...] In markets where the average income was low, tickets were sold for a lower price, which was enough for the band to break even, but not lose any money in the process.|$|E

60|$|If {{the swirl}} of a fish among the sedges caught his keen eye, he would change his tactics, letting his game come to him instead of {{stalking}} it, {{as he did with}} the frogs.

He would stand sometimes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>hour</b> on one leg, letting his head sink slowly down on his shoulders, his neck curled back, his long sharp bill pointing always straight at the quivering line which marked the playing fish, his eyes half closed till the right moment came. Then you would see his long neck shoot down, hear the splash and, later, the whack of his catch against the nearest root, to kill it; and watch with curious feelings of sympathy as he hid it in the grass and covered it over, lest Hawahak the hawk should see, or Cheokhes the mink smell it, and rob him while he fished.|$|E
