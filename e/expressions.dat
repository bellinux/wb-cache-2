40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} the relationship between fibroblast telomerase <b>expression,</b> myofibroblasts, and telomerase-mediated regulatory signals in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: Thirty-four surgical lung biopsies, which had been obtained from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and histologically classified as usual interstitial pneumonia, were examined. Immunohistochemistry {{was used to evaluate}} fibroblast telomerase <b>expression,</b> myofibroblast &# 945;-smooth muscle actin <b>expression</b> and the tissue <b>expression</b> of inter leu kin- 4, transforming growth factor-&# 946;, and basic fibroblast growth factor. The point-counting technique was used to quantify the <b>expression</b> of these markers in unaffected, collapsed, mural fibrosis, and honeycombing areas. The results were correlated to patient survival. RESULTS: Fibroblast telomerase <b>expression</b> and basic fibroblast growth factor tissue <b>expression</b> were higher in collapsed areas, whereas myofibroblast <b>expression</b> and interleukine- 4 tissue <b>expression</b> were higher in areas of mural fibrosis. Transforming growth factor-&# 946; <b>expression</b> was higher in collapsed, mural fibrosis and honeycombing areas in comparison to unaffected areas. Positive correlations were found between basic fibroblast growth factor tissue <b>expression</b> and fibroblast telomerase <b>expression</b> and between interleukin- 4 tissue <b>expression</b> and myofibroblast &# 945;-smooth muscle actin <b>expression.</b> Negative correlations were observed between interleukin- 4 <b>expression</b> and basic fibroblast growth factor tissue <b>expression</b> in areas of mural fibrosis. Myofibroblast &# 945;-smooth muscle actin <b>expression</b> and interleukin- 4 tissue <b>expression</b> in areas of mural fibrosis were negatively associated with patient survival. CONCLUSION: Fibroblast telomerase <b>expression</b> is higher in areas of early remodeling in lung tissues demonstrating typical interstitial pneumonia, whereas myofibroblast &# 945;-smooth muscle actin <b>expression</b> predominates in areas of late remodeling. These events seem to be regulated by basic fibroblast growth factor and interleukin- 4 tissue <b>expression,</b> respectively...|$|R

40|$|Snail is a zinc-finger {{transcription}} factor that triggers the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by directly repressing E-cadherin <b>expression.</b> However, {{the relationship between}} E-cadherin and Snail <b>expression</b> remains unclear in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The {{purpose of the present}} study was to evaluate the clinical significance of E-cadherin and Snail <b>expression</b> in ESCC. Immunohistochemistry was used to investigate the <b>expression</b> of E-cadherin and Snail proteins in 194 patients with ESCC. The relationship between <b>expression</b> of these proteins and clinicopathological factors was analyzed, and the usefulness of Snail in disease prognosis was evaluated in relation to E-cadherin <b>expression.</b> E-cadherin <b>expression</b> was preserved in 41. 2 % of tumors, and Snail <b>expression</b> was confirmed in 61. 7 %. Tumors with reduced E-cadherin <b>expression</b> invaded deeper (P< 0. 0001), had more lymph node metastasis (P< 0. 0001) and had more lymphatic invasion (P= 0. 0011) than tumors with preserved <b>expression.</b> Tumors that were positive for Snail <b>expression</b> invaded deeper (P= 0. 0385), had more distant lymph node metastasis (pM) (P= 0. 0051) and had a more advanced stage (P= 0. 0044) than those that were negative for Snail <b>expression.</b> Snail <b>expression</b> was not significantly correlated with reduced E-cadherin <b>expression.</b> Patients with reduced E-cadherin <b>expression</b> or positive Snail <b>expression</b> had poor clinical outcomes. In the preserved E-cadherin group, overall survival rate was better in patients with negative Snail <b>expression</b> than in those with positive Snail <b>expression</b> (P= 0. 035). Snail appears to play a key role in preserved E-cadherin <b>expression.</b> Further studies on other molecules in the pathways related to reduced E-cadherin <b>expression</b> in ESCC from the view-point of EMT are necessary...|$|R

Immunohistochemistry was used in examining the relationship between E-cadherin <b>expression</b> and stage in 59 oesophageal and 52 lung cancers. Advanced-stage oesophageal cancers were associated with both reduced and disorganised E-cadherin <b>expression</b> (P 0. 05). No differences in stage were seen between tumours with reduced or disorganised E-cadherin <b>expression.</b> Altered E-cadherin <b>expression</b> was detected in dysplastic, non-invasive Barrett's oesophagus.

The more conserved gene <b>expression</b> in some biological processes than is expected in a purely neutral model reveals negative selection on gene <b>expression.</b> However, fast evolving genes mainly support the neutrality of gene <b>expression</b> evolution, and (2) gene <b>expression</b> conservation is positively but only slightly correlated with promoter conservation based on a motif-count score of the promoter alignment.

Systems with relatively rapid <b>expression</b> deactivation rates (unstable gene <b>expression)</b> had more predictable responses to a gradient of inducer than systems with slow or zero <b>expression</b> deactivation rates (stable gene <b>expression),</b> and diploid systems were more predictable than haploid, with or without dosage compensation.

The facial identities of test faces were the same or different from the adaptor, while orthogonally, the <b>expression</b> configurations of those facial identities were also the same or different. The result shows that the change of <b>expression</b> configuration impaired the <b>expression</b> aftereffect when the facial identities of adaptor and tests were the same; however, the impairment effect disappears when facial identities were different, indicating the identity-independent <b>expression</b> representation is more robust to the change of the <b>expression</b> configuration in comparison with the identity-dependent <b>expression</b> representation. In the second experiment, we used schematic line faces as adaptors and real faces as tests to minimize the similarity between the adaptor and tests, which is expected to exclude the contribution from the identity-dependent <b>expression</b> representation to <b>expression</b> aftereffect. The second experiment yields a similar result as the identity-independent <b>expression</b> aftereffect observed in Experiment 1.

40|$|<b>Expression</b> of {{the gene}} for the {{extracellular}} alkaline protease (aprE) of Bacillus subtilis is subject to regulation by many positive and negative regulators. We have found that aprE <b>expression</b> was increased by disruption of the glutamine synthetase gene glnA. The increase in aprE <b>expression</b> was attributed to a decreased in <b>expression</b> of scoC, which encodes a negative regulator of aprE <b>expression.</b> The glnA effect on scoC <b>expression</b> was abolished by further disruption of tnrA, indicating that aprE <b>expression</b> is under global regulation through TnrA. In the scoC background, however, aprE <b>expression</b> was decreased by glnA deletion, and it was shown that the decrease was due to a defect in positive regulation by DegU. Among the genes that affect aprE <b>expression</b> through DegU, the <b>expression</b> of degR, encoding a protein that stabilizes phosphorylated DegU, was inhibited by glnA deletion. It was further shown that the decrease in degR <b>expression</b> by glnA deletion was caused by inhibition of the <b>expression</b> of sigD, encoding the σD factor, which is required for degR <b>expression.</b> In accordance with these findings, the <b>expression</b> levels of aprE-lacZ in glnA scoC degR and scoC degR strains were identical.
