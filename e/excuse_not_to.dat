25|$|However, James had {{a dilemma}} {{stemming}} from mutual distrust {{between himself and}} parliament. He feared that if he went to war, parliament would find an excuse to avoid providing the finance to support it. Parliament, on the other hand, feared that if they voted the finances, the king would find an <b>excuse</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> go to war. James died shortly afterwards, leaving {{foreign policy in the}} hands of Charles, who rather naively assumed that if he followed the policy parliament had advocated, it would provide the funds for it.|$|E
25|$|In a September 2004 {{edition of}} Entertainment Weekly, Danes {{insisted that she}} didn't have enough power to cause the {{cancellation}} by herself. It is generally accepted that ABC considered bringing the show back for a second season and may have even intended to (as then-executive Ted Harbert claims) due to its devoted fanbase, its quality and its critical acclaim. However, low ratings kept the network from reviving it. Winnie Holzman theorized that the network was so on-the-fence about renewing the show {{that in some ways}} they used Danes' reluctance to return as a convenient <b>excuse</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> renew the series.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, Lishansky {{attempted}} {{to join the}} HaShomer organization. HaShomer required a trial period for all recruits, and Lishansky was sent to guard in Poria, Rishon LeZion, Ben Shemen and finally Menahemia. In February 1915, Lishansky's force killed the leader of an Arab gang that attacked the village. Because of HaShomer's policy of avoiding blood feuds with the Arabs, Lishansky was declined entry to the organization. This was later perceived simply as an <b>excuse</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> accept Lishansky, who was proficient {{in the use of}} weapons, horseback riding and Arabic. Israel Shochat, a leader of HaShomer, later wrote that Lishansky often demonstrated weakness, adventurism and boastfulness.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{was widely}} lauded for his daring feat. The House of Assembly in Jamaica awarded him a £300 sword. King George III created him a Knight Bachelor on 1 February 1800. Hamilton also {{received}} a Naval Gold Medal for the action. He was also voted a freeman of the City of London on 6 March 1800, {{which was to be}} awarded him in a gold box with a value of 50 guineas. The wounded Hamilton was sent home to recover aboard the Jamaica packet, but on her voyage she was captured by the French and Hamilton was taken prisoner. He was sent to Paris, where he seems to have come to the attention of Napoleon Bonaparte. Hamilton spent six months in prison, before being released and repatriated, having been exchanged for four French midshipmen. He finally made it to London, in time to be present at a special banquet held by the Court of Common Council of the City of London to celebrate the anniversary of his cutting out of the Hermione. Here he received his gold box and the freedom of the city. He was also offered a pension of £300 a year for his wounds, which he turned down. He was both rich enough from his prize money not to need the pension, and also feared that taking it might be used as an <b>excuse</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> give him active employment again.|$|E

The race marked {{the second time in}} under a month that American Pharoah, {{training}} with Baffert in California, had flown across the country, raising concerns that the extensive air travel was taking a toll on the horse. [...] The only previous Triple Crown winner to win the Travers was Whirlaway in 1941, and two others, Gallant Fox and Affirmed, had been defeated there, helping give the track its nickname [...] "Graveyard of Champions". [...] Baffert had one Travers win (in 2001 with Point Given) in five previous attempts.

Brett Todd of PC Gamer US awarded it [...] "Mod of the Month" [...] and wrote, [...] "It doesn't quite have the mysterious allure of the {{original}} games, but it's awfully close". A writer for Jolt Online Gaming praised the mod's visuals and considered its missions to be [...] "incredibly well designed".

[...] PC Gamer UKs Kieron Gillen wrote that he had expected the mod to be cancelled, given that the [...] "web is full of [...] five-percent finished masterworks from people who aimed far, far too high."

500|$|Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, {{except in}} the absence of the {{official}} captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of the amateur Norman Yardley in the side. Yardley claimed several times that he would have stood down in Hutton's favour, but the committee remained distrustful of professional captaincy and thought Hutton a hypochondriac who used his health as an <b>excuse</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> play. Hutton was a reserved man for whom the Yorkshire dressing room clashes of the 1950s held little appeal. As the side's senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking. The team was divided and the players frequently clashed with each other; some critics believe this was a factor in the county's failure to win the County Championship in the 1950s. Ray Illingworth, a player at the time, believes that Hutton was the only man who could have changed the negative attitude around the team, but [...] "he didn't do anything about it". Illingworth recalled that he was a [...] "distant hero", saying: [...] "He was a funny man was Len—slightly sarcastic all the time. He'd hear an argument in the dressing room and he'd throw a bit of wood on the fire to keep it going. He looked after himself, he was very much of a loner." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{animated}} series {{received a}} generally positive reception in North America. [...] In January 2004, Yu Yu Hakusho {{was named the}} second best action-adventure anime by Anime Insider. It was voted by the users of IGN as the tenth best animated series of all time. Critical reviews focused on the series' attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. Animerica's Justin Kovalsky defined Yu Yu Hakusho as a character-driven series and compared it to other anime like Phantom Quest Corp., Rurouni Kenshin, and Flame of Recca in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology. Allen Divers of the Anime News Network identified Yu Yu Hakusho as [...] "one of the best action series out there", and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series. Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, [...] "It's a fun show with a great cast, a sense of humor, {{and a lot of}} action so there's no <b>excuse</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> at least give it a chance." [...] He recommended the first three-season box sets of Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as the original boxset of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show's third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines. N. S. Davidson of IGN concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that good writing, interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime's final episodes that Yu Yu Hakusho possesses all of these qualities. This was concurred upon by Joseph Luster of Otaku USA, who summed up his feelings about the universe of Yu Yu Hakusho by stating, [...] "Togashi's world is eternally hellish and dark, but wildly varied. The only thing that doesn't change throughout its run is the fact that you'll still be rooting for the well-defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode." ...|$|E

So if the speaker were to ask a passing stranger near the arena about the start time of the concert, he might formulate, “Can you tell me when the concert starts?” The expected obstacle is formed by lack of ability and willingness of the stranger to answer the question.

She wrote that a similar kind of oppression by hierarchy also happened in other categories of identity, such as race, class and religion, but she claimed that it was nowhere more true than with gender in which men stereotyped women and used it {{as an excuse to}} organize society into a patriarchy.|$|E

50|$|Clinically, {{anosognosia}} {{is often}} assessed by giving patients an anosognosia questionnaire {{in order to}} assess their metacognitive knowledge of deficits. However, neither of the existing questionnaires applied in the clinics are designed thoroughly for evaluating the multidimensional nature of this clinical phenomenon; nor are the responses obtained via offline questionnaire capable of revealing the discrepancy of awareness observed from their online task performance. The discrepancy is noticed when patients showed no awareness of their deficits from the offline responses to the questionnaire but demonstrated reluctance or verbal circumlocution when asked to perform an online task.
