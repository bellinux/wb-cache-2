40|$|It is very {{important}} to standardize <b>mechanical</b> <b>parts</b> as productivity increases. But, this is a very difficult subject, {{because there are a lot}} of kinds of different <b>mechanical</b> <b>parts,</b> and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>parts</b> are very complicated. Therefore, we have developed a support system, which standardizes the <b>mechanical</b> <b>parts.</b> The <b>mechanical</b> <b>parts</b> can divide into several components, and it is relatively easy to standardize these components. We built an individual standardization data base for each component, and link these data bases into a system. The system used a macro function, which records a series of operations of three-dimensional CAD system. This paper describes the methods for standardizing the <b>mechanical</b> <b>parts</b> by the macro function, with an emphasis on the method for building the standardization data base automatically, the method for generating a frame of input and output formats, and so on...|$|R

The core of <b>mechanical</b> <b>part</b> recognition {{is the part}} image feature extraction. Thus, how to extract part features to meet the real time requirements for the automated production line has a crucial role. A novel feature extraction algorithm is presented for part image features in this paper. It aims to optimize the fuzzy Fisher criterion function to figure out two orthogonal optimal discriminant vectors in an unsupervised way. Based on these two vectors, the linear transformation from d-dimension to 2 -dimension can be obtained. Experimental results on three <b>mechanical</b> <b>parts</b> show its effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|A lot of <b>mechanical</b> <b>parts</b> {{are subject}} to failure due to the deterioration. Usually the {{preventive}} maintenance is taken {{to ensure the safety}} and reliability. Therefore, {{it is very important to}} study the gradual reliability design of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>part</b> for improving the gradual reliability of the mechanical system under the condition of considering the preventive maintenance. Beta distribution is employed to describe the randomness of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>part</b> state after the preventive maintenance. The deterioration process of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>part</b> is modeled using the nonstationary Gamma process. The gradual reliability model before the first preventive maintenance is proposed according to the gradual failure principle and using the initial state distribution and the properties of Gamma process. Then, the gradual reliability model between any two times of preventive maintenance is also derived. Subsequently, the sensitivity equations of the proposed gradual reliability model to each parameter are given. The application process and practicality of the proposed approach are described by a numerical example. This work solved the problem where the maintenance has not been well considered in the reliability design of the <b>mechanical</b> <b>part</b> and contributed to the theory and method of improving the safety and reliability operation of the mechanical system...|$|R
