5|$|The lichen {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in the southeastern United States; in 1954 the north border of its distribution was given as a line passing through southern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia. Although the northern limit was extended to southern Delaware, the author later revised his opinion, and the northern limit {{is thought to be}} North Carolina. In North Carolina, it is found on Smith Island, a notable location because it represents the northern limit of the distribution of cabbage palmetto (Sabal palmetto). The presence of this 6meter (20ft) tree interspersed among the <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species Quercus virginiana give the island a subtropical appearance—consistent with the lichen's preferred climate.|$|E
5|$|Amphibian {{habitats}} in Michigan {{are generally}} split into four regions: {{the northern and}} southern Lower Peninsula and the eastern and western Upper Peninsula, with differentiation based on climate, soils, underlying bedrock and glacially-derived landforms. Region One, the southern Lower Peninsula, is generally characterized by a warmer, less variable climate. Loam and clay soils dominate the region, with a lesser amount of sand, and deciduous hardwoods are the <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species, with some natural prairies and savannas. There is a greater diversity of plant life in this region, and it includes plant and animal species that are not found in any of the other regions. Region Two, the northern Lower Peninsula, has a climate that is cooler and more variable, with greater precipitation, due to its proximity to the Great Lakes, more extensive uplands and more northern latitude. Sandy soils and glacial deposits are the dominant soil type, while forests of conifer or mixed conifer/hardwood predominate. Swamps and bogs are found more often in Region Two than Region One. Region Three, the eastern Upper Peninsula, has a climate profile similar to Region Two. Sand and clay dominate the soil of this region, and tend to be low in nutrients and poorly drained. There are extensive wetlands, dominated by coniferous forests, while upland areas provide mixed conifer/broadleaf hardwood tracts. Region Four, the western Upper Peninsula, provides extensive bedrock structures. The temperature is less moderate than in the other three regions, and can see frigid winters and hot summers. Mixed conifer/broadleaf forests again predominate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Phoebe hui is a {{precious}} timber tree species. In {{order to get}} excellent seedlings and stands with good genes and develop Phoebe hui better, {{it is necessary to}} select superior <b>trees.</b> The <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> comparative method and small sample plot method were used to evaluate and select Phoebe hui superior trees in Longshan county, Hunan province, and the evaluation factors included diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, timber volume and other quality factors. The results showed that, using the <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> comparative method, the DBH, tree height and timber volume values of the superior tree were more than 1. 12, 1. 06 and 1. 23 times of the mean values of 5 <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> respectively, and 6 superior trees were selected in two stands. Using small sample plot method, the DBH, tree height and timber volume of the superior tree were more than the mean value and 1 times standard deviation value of the stand, and 4 trees were selected as superior tree. These 2 methods can be used for superior tree selection of Phoebe hui in Hunan, and the <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> comparative method is more simple and easier for operation...|$|R

5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E
25|$|Type IIb: Raphiolepsis-Livistona dry {{forest is}} found in upland areas with few clouds and rocky soils. Rhaphiolepis integerrima is the <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species, along with the fan palm Livistona chinensis var. bonensis, Pandanus boninensis and Ochrosia nakaiana.|$|E
25|$|It mainly {{occurs in}} {{evergreen}} broad-leaved forest but also occurs in marshes, grassland and cultivated land close to forested areas and water. Itaji (Castanopsis sieboldii) is the <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> in the rail's habitat {{but it also}} occurs among other trees such as Ryukyu Pine (Pinus luchuensis). It requires dense ground vegetation as well as standing water for bathing.|$|E
30|$|Water {{availability}} induced size-asymmetric growth partitioning. Drought favoured {{growth of}} small {{trees at the}} expense of predominant trees. Stand growth share of <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> changed with water availability.|$|R

25|$|Pinus strobus {{is found}} in the nearctic {{temperate}} broadleaf and mixed forests biome of eastern North America. It prefers well-drained or sandy soils and humid climates, but can also grow in boggy areas and rocky highlands. In mixed forests, this <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> towers over many others, including some of the large broadleaf hardwoods. It provides food and shelter for numerous forest birds, such as the red crossbill, and small mammals such as squirrels.|$|E
25|$|Igapó {{and other}} flooded forests {{typically}} display a lower diversity of plants than that seen in terra firme forests. Similar to other forests {{found throughout the}} tropics, {{it is common to}} observe only a few <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species Distribution of trees and other plants is highly dependent on inundation tolerances of species causing a non-random distribution of plants where more flood-tolerant species are found at lower elevations and less flood-tolerant species are found on higher ground.|$|E
25|$|The {{tower is}} {{located near the}} center of the small {{clearing}} left by early 20th-century logging operations. It is surrounded on all sides by tall balsam fir and red spruce, the <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species in the boreal forest found at high elevations in the Catskills. The observer's cabin, with a small protected porch, is just to the southeast. Its windows are covered in steel mesh to protect it from porcupines, abundant in the Catskill forests, which chew on the wood.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> {{along the}} river's edge are {{sycamore}} and cottonwood, along with silver maple, sugar maple, sassafras and mulberry. The surrounding bottomland {{is dominated by}} shagbark hickory and white oak.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} competition effects, measurements for monitoring growth responses on drought or {{other kind of}} stress are mostly based on <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> of forest stands (Rigling et al. 2002; Rais et al. 2014). The growth response of the <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> is supposed to reflect the relative growth reduction of the total stand. This is correct if the relative growth reduction is similar for trees of all sizes and if the stress {{does not change the}} partitioning. We found, however, that in the drought years 2003 and 2015 the growth of dominant Norway spruces decreased to 50 % or 54 % of the pre-drought period. The trees on average decreased just to 58 % and 71 %, respectively; the small trees decreased even less or not at all (64 % and 101 %). So, if quantifications of stress responses and growth losses would be based just on <b>dominant</b> <b>trees,</b> such losses would be considerably overestimated. For monitoring stress responses of tree populations also the small trees should be measured, cored, or equipped with permanent increment girth tapes.|$|R

25|$|Widespread {{clearance}} {{of forest}} {{began in the}} Bronze Age and continued up until the early 20th century. Afforestation programmes began in the 1920s and accelerated in the 1950s with the widespread planting of conifer forest, especially in upland moorland areas previously considered unsuitable for planting. The <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> is the sitka spruce, accounting for 58% of forest plantations, with lodgepole pine, Norway spruce, Scots pine, larch and Douglas fir also planted. Biodiversity is low in the conifer plantations {{because they are not}} native tree species. Broadleaf plantations are rare, accounting for less than 10% of forest.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, she hired William Lawrence Bottomley {{to create a}} unique {{addition}} known as the Finger Bowl, an outdoor dining area consisting of a raised pool surrounded by a flat ledge. Chairs were {{pulled up to the}} ledge and food was served from bowls floating on the water. It was sheltered by a wisteria-covered arbor supported by 12 stone piers. In the late 1930s, Gifford Pinchot started the White Pine Plantation to reforest some old farmland near the mansion. He was particularly interested in that species since it was the <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> in the forests of Pike County and had been heavily harvested during the previous century.|$|E
25|$|Casa de Campo is an {{enormous}} urban parkland {{to the west of}} the city, the largest in Spain and Madrid's main green lung. Its area is more than 1,700 hectares (6.6 sq mi). It is home to a fairground, the Madrid Zoo, an amusement park, the Parque de Atracciones de Madrid, and an outdoor municipal pool, to enjoy a bird's eye view of the park and city take a cable car trip above the tree tops. Casa de Campo's vegetation is one of its most important features. There are, in fact, three different ecosystems: oak, pine and river groves. The oak is the <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species in the area and, although many of them are over 100 years old and reach a great height, they are also present in the form of chaparral and bushes. The pine-forest ecosystem boasts a large number of trees that have adapted perfectly to the light, dry conditions in the park. In addition, mushrooms often emerge after the first rains of autumn. Finally, the river groves, or riparian forests, are made up of various, mainly deciduous, species that grow in wetter areas. Examples include poplars, willows and alder trees. As regards fauna, this green space is home to approximately 133 vertebrate species.|$|E
50|$|Phyllonorycter chionopa is a moth of the Gracillariidae family. It {{is known}} from Namibia. The habitat {{consists}} of sandy floodplains and rocky slopes along dry river beds with <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> as Acacia montis-usti and Commiphora species.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> are Tsuga dumosa, Picea smithiana, and Abies spp. Less common are Larix griffithiana, Larix potaninii, Pinus wallichiana, and Taxus baccata. Near timberline {{are found}} various junipers: Juniperus indica, Juniperus recurva, and Juniperus squamata.|$|R
50|$|The park {{lies within}} the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecoregion. Landscapes {{within the park}} include grasslands, heathlands, pine barrens, and woodlands. Oak and pine are the <b>dominant</b> <b>trees</b> within the park. Many rare species may also be located here.|$|R
25|$|The {{climate of}} the park, and in turn also its flora and fauna, is largely typical for mountainous regions of the eastern Mid-Atlantic woodland, and indeed {{a large portion of}} common species are typical of {{ecosystems}} at lower altitudes as well. On southwestern faces of some of the southernmost hillsides pine predominates and there is also the occasional prickly pear cactus, which grows naturally. In contrast, some of the northeastern aspects are most likely to have small but dense stands of moisture loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance. Other commonly found plants include oak, hickory, chestnut, maple, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The once predominant American chestnut tree was effectively brought to extinction by a fungus known as the chestnut blight during the 1930s – though the tree continues to grow in the park, it does not reach maturity and dies back before it can reproduce. Various species of oaks superseded the chestnuts and became the <b>dominant</b> <b>tree</b> species. Gypsy moth infestations beginning in the early 1990s began to erode the dominance of the oak forests as the moths would primarily consume the leaves of oak trees. Though the Gypsy moths seem to have abated some, they continue to affect the forest and have destroyed almost 10 percent of the oak groves.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, {{conservation}} {{efforts of the}} red maple have caused a major increase in the population of white-tailed deer since the mid-20th century.

Extensive use of red maple in landscaping has also contributed to the surge in the species' numbers as volunteer seedlings proliferate. Finally, disease epidemics have greatly reduced the population of elms and chestnuts in the forests of the US. While mainline forest trees continue to dominate mesic sites with rich soil, more marginal areas are increasingly being dominated by red maple.|$|E

Much of the bird's African juniper forest habitat [...] has been damaged or destroyed due to human usage; the ability of this dead woodland to support the Djibouti francolin remains unknown, although some juveniles have been seen in it. It is believed that the birds are reacting to the destruction of their juniper habitat by trying to find habitat as close to it as possible.
