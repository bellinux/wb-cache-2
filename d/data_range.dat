2500|$|Before {{computing}} the DCT of the 8×8 block, {{its values}} are shifted from a positive range to one centered on zero. For an 8-bit image, each {{entry in the}} original block falls in the range [...] The midpoint of the range (in this case, the value 128) is subtracted from each entry to produce a <b>data</b> <b>range</b> that is centered on zero, so that the modified range is [...] This step reduces the dynamic range requirements in the DCT processing stage that follows. (Aside from the difference in dynamic range within the DCT stage, this step is mathematically equivalent to subtracting 2048 from the DC coefficient after performing the transform– which {{may be a better}} way to perform the operation on some architectures since it involves performing only one subtraction rather than 64 of them.) ...|$|E

Other apps {{may be used}} as are browsers for viewing meteorological data and accessing social networking services. Some handsets can be used as WiFi hotspots and wireless cards may also be used to avoid committing a handset to tethering or operating as a hotspot. Some hotspots operate as mobile broadband MNVO devices using any radio spectrum that is both available and is in contract with a service provider. Such devices may expand mobile <b>data</b> <b>range</b> beyond a single carrier's service area and typically can work on month-to-month contracts. Adoption of tablet computers is expanding as of the early 2010s. 4G LTE has been adopted when available and can be especially useful for uploading HD video. A gradual uptick of those selecting mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs) began in the mid-2010s although DSLR remains heavily favored. Usage of DSLR for video capture, called HDSLR, is common, although HD camcorders remain popular due to their greater functionality (many chasers still shoot both).|$|E

Multidimensional data is meant {{in this context}} to describe scalar data associated with a three dimensional geometry or otherwise too complex to be well represented by traditional graphs. Raster graphics techniques are used to display a shaded image of a three dimensional geometry. The use of color to represent scalar data associated with the geometries in shaded images is explored. Distinct hues are associated with discrete <b>data</b> <b>ranges,</b> thus emulating the traditional representation of data with isarithms, or lines of constant numerical value. <b>Data</b> <b>ranges</b> are alternatively associated with a continuous spectrum of hues to show subtler data trends.

40|$|A general radix- 2 FFT {{algorithm}} {{was recently}} developed and implemented for Modern Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architectures.

50|$|The {{most common}} data {{interpretation}} {{is based on}} the Fresnel formulas, which treat the formed thin films as infinite, continuous dielectric layers. This interpretation may result in multiple possible refractive index and thickness values. However, usually only one solution is within the reasonable <b>data</b> <b>range.</b> In Multi-Parametric Surface Plasmon Resonance, two SPR curves are acquired by scanning a range of angles at two different wavelengths, which results in a unique solution for both thickness and refractive index.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} part of the 20th century, DPF {{instruments}} were often installed in the battery commanders' stations for coast artillery batteries and were used by the battery commander or a member of his staff to yield firing <b>data</b> (<b>range</b> and azimuth, or direction) for the guns. This system was generally much less accurate than the horizontal base system (based on observations from two widely separated base end stations), and became a back-up system that was used only in emergencies (such as damage to other observation stations).|$|E
50|$|Some controllers, such as pitch bend, are special. Whereas the <b>data</b> <b>range</b> of most {{continuous}} controllers (such as volume, for example) {{consists of}} 128 steps ranging in value from 0 to 127, pitch bend data may be encoded with over 16,000 data steps. This produces {{the illusion of}} a continuously sliding pitch, as in a violin's portamento, rather than a series of zippered steps such as a guitarist sliding their finger up the frets of their guitar's neck. Thus, the pitch wheel on a MIDI keyboard may generate large amounts of data which can lead to a slowdown of data throughput.|$|E
