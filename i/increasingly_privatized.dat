Private probation agencies generally require less certification, license, education, training, and employment recommendations than required of probation officers in the employ of the state. Moreover, while a heavy caseload is burdensome to the state, for a private agency, heavy caseloads can be profitable and are often planned for, even if services for individual clients deteriorate. States rarely employ minimum standards for private probation agencies. As such, agencies have less incentive to report violations, and there is usually less oversight requiring them to do so.|$|R

Second, this sub-group marginalization is exacerbated by the politics of retrenchment which <b>increasingly</b> <b>privatizes</b> risks onto individuals, states, and non-governmental providers.

40|$|Although {{domestic}} {{administrative law}} scholars have long debated privatization within the US, this debate has not confronted the growing phenomenon of privatization {{in the international}} realm or {{its impact on the}} values embodied in public international law. Yet, with both nation-states and international organizations <b>increasingly</b> <b>privatizing</b> foreign affairs functions, privatization is now as significant a phenomenon internationally as it is domestically. For example, states are turning to private actors to perform core military, foreign aid, and diplomatic functions. Military privatization entered the popular consciousness in 2004, when private contractors working for the US government abused detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. But this is only the tip of the iceberg. The US is increasingly using private actors for logistical support to combat troops and to provide strategic planning and tactical advice. Other states, such as Sierra Leone, have used private contractors to engage in direct combat, and international organizations have weighed the possibilities of using private contractors to perform peacekeeping. In the foreign aid context, states and international organizations are entering into agreements with private non-profit and for-profit entities to deliver all forms of aid, including humanitarian relief, development assistance, and post-conflict reconstruction. Even diplomatic tasks such as peacekeeping negotiations are being undertaken by private actors. In this Essay I suggest that the domestic U. S. administrative law literature may provide a useful set of responses to privatization that has been largely overlooked by international law scholars, policy-makers, and activists. In particular, I argue that possibilities for extending public law values inhere in the privatized relationship itself, particularly in the government contracts that are the very engine of privatization. Thus, the contracts governments enter into with non-state actors can include many provisions that would help to create both standards of behavior, performance benchmarks, and a means of providing some measure of public accountability. In this Essay, I outline nine such contractual provisions. Specifically, I suggest that contracts be drafted to: (1) explicitly extend relevant norms of public international law to private contractors, (2) specify training requirements, (3) provide for enhanced monitoring both within the government and by independent third-party monitors, (4) require accreditation, (5) establish clear performance benchmarks, (6) mandate self-evaluation by the contractors, (7) provide for governmental takeovers of failing contracts, (8) include opportunities for public participation in the contract negotiation process, and (9) enhance whistleblower protections and rights of third-party beneficiaries to enforce contractual terms. And while these provisions are not a panacea, they may be at least as effective as the relatively weak enforcement regime of public international law. At the same time, by considering the field of international privatization, I seek to open what I believe could be a fruitful dialogue between domestic administrative law scholars and international law scholars about possible responses...|$|R

Indeed, modern libertarianism characterizes the majority of laws as intrusive to personal autonomy and, in particular, argues that the right of self-defense from coercion (including violence) is a fundamental human right, and in all cases, with no exceptions, justifies all uses of violence stemming from this right, regardless whether in defense of the person or property.

Among these changes includes the development of online education and its proliferation among various disciplines to not only increase educational access, but to sustain budgetary program needs. Such processes are occurring in women's studies (WS) programs across the country, which can be problematic in terms of fostering a feminist classroom in virtual space. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine key characteristics of feminist pedagogy and its implementation and effects it has on students in the online WS classroom, considering that WS courses seek to transform and empower students to create social change. This study utilizes qualitative feminist interviewing methods to derive common themes about feminist pedagogy from narratives by students who have taken online WS courses, traditional face-to-face courses, and a hybrid of both. Findings suggest that students who take online WS courses experience a more independent learning environment and tend to lack community building in their virtual classroom compared to students who take face-to-face courses. Findings also reveal that a majority of participants would choose traditional WS classes rather than online course options. Future research is recommended in the areas of more nuanced theorizing about a cyberfeminist pedagogy and using online web technologies to build community in virtual WS classrooms...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} intersection of sound, public space, and social difference in contemporary Japanese urban life through ethnographic analysis of a Japanese street musical practice called "chindon-ya. " Chindon-ya, which {{dates back to the}} 1850 s, refers to groups of outlandishly costumed street musicians in Japan who are hired to advertise an employer's business. After decades of inactivity, chindon-ya has been undergoing a resurgence since the early 1990 s. Despite being labeled as anachronistic and obscure, some chindon-ya troupes today have achieved financial success generating up to one million dollars in annual income, while chindon-ya aesthetics has been taken up by rock, jazz, and experimental musicians and refashioned into hybridized musical practices. In the context of long-term economic downturn, growing socioeconomic gaps, and visually and sonically saturated urban streets, I ask how such an "outdated" means of advertisement has not only proven itself to be financially viable, but has also enabled widely varying sentiments, musical styles, translocal relations, forms of business enterprise, and political aspirations to articulate with one another. I analyze ethnographic observations, interviews, audio-visual materials, and archival documents I collected during fieldwork in Japan between 2006 and 2008 in order to investigate how chindon-ya has recently become reinvested and reconfigured with new meanings and possibilities. Bridging cultural geography and anthropology of sound, I pay particular attention to the production of social space through sonic culture. The popular imaginary of chindon-ya is closely associated with neighborhood streets, everyday soundscape, and the notion of "taishû" - the popular mass, or the public. When the neighborhood streets are <b>increasingly</b> regulated, <b>privatized,</b> and developed, and when "taishu" is fragmented through the recession era, what kinds of understanding of space and "public" emerge from chindon-ya today as they resonate with the shifting geographies of urban modernity? By extension, through this investigation, I raise what Stuart Hall calls the multicultural question in Japan by asking who constitutes the listening public as imagined by chindon-ya practitioners. I posit that listening to chindon-ya's sounds challenges the commonsense notion of Japanese public space as anonymous, transparent, and homogeneous. Rather, the performative tactics of chindon-ya highlight issues that are otherwise silenced by the official discourse of Japan as a monoethnic nation: the Japanese colonial histories; the presence of "ethnic minorities"; and political struggles between the island of Okinawa, mainland Japan, and the US military. These analyses in turn shed light on how chindon-ya aesthetic has enabled emergent modalities of political expressions, based on politics of pleasure instead of politics of indignation. Even though my multi-sited research takes place within the national border of Japan, it has a broader regional significance. My research elucidates connections, interactions, and flows between Japan and wider Pacific regions that are produced both within and beyond the national borders. In addition, the combination of my sonic-spatial analytic, based on cultural geography and anthropology of sound, and ethnographic focus on everyday practices has a significant theoretical and methodological import to other entanglements of translocal interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{amenity value}} {{provided}} by urban green spaces, water bodies and good environmental quality {{is difficult to}} assess and incorporate into urban planning and development. Developers and governments in China hitherto have seldom objectively factored these attributes into property pricing and associated decisions. The hedonic pricing method offers an appropriate approach to gauge such external benefits which contribute to real-estate transaction prices. This study explored the impacts of key environmental elements with a bearing on residential housing value in Guangzhou, including window orientation, green-space view, floor height, proximity to wooded areas and water bodies, and exposure to traffic noise. Four large private housing estates composed of multi-storied blocks with similar design and price bracket, catering to the mass property market, were sampled. Transaction price data and structural attributes of 652 dwelling units were acquired directly from developers. Data on environmental attributes were collected in the field. Two functional hedonic pricing method models, linear and semi-log, were constructed. The semi-log model offered comparatively stronger explanatory power and more reliable estimation. High floor on the multi-storey tenement blocks contributed implicitly 9. 2 % to the selling price. View of green spaces and proximity to water bodies raised housing price, contributing notably at 7. 1 % and 13. 2 %, respectively. Windows with a southern orientation with or without complementary eastern or northern views added 1 % to the price. Proximity to nearby wooded area without public access was not significant, expressing the pragmatic mindset in the hedonic behavior. Exposure to traffic noise did not influence willingness-to-pay, implying tolerance of the chronic environmental nuisance in the compact city. The study demonstrates that hedonic pricing method could be applied in the Chinese context with an <b>increasingly</b> expanding and <b>privatized</b> property market. It could inform the decisions of policy makers and property developers concerning land selling and buying, land conversion, property development, urban nature conservation, and design of ecological green-space networks. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Drawn {{from more}} than two years of ethnographic data collection, this {{dissertation}} study explores the literacy practices enacted in a youth media organization (the Youth Media Group) that is a branch of a public access television station (Manhattan Media) in New York City. Rooted in New Literacy Studies, a branch of scholarship which explores reading and writing primarily as social practices and cultural forms, this study understands literacy in relation to the larger economic, political, social, and historical contexts in which reading and writing always exist. Drawing also from semiotic and multimodal literacy theory, this study positions media production, specifically the digital video production, distribution, and consumption of media texts that takes place in my field site, to be a literacy practice – one that involves reading and writing, albeit with a medium other than traditional print. ^ As a medium, public access television has a decidedly different purpose than commercial television in that it aims to create opportunities for communication, education, artistic expression and other non-commercial uses of media amongst the general public. Both Manhattan Media and its Youth Media Group position the production and distribution of community-oriented media as a social advocacy tool to educate individuals and advance civic participation around issues of community concern. However, popular and institutional discourses increasingly position literacy first and foremost as a tool for individual advancement to compete in a market economy, rather than as a means through which to participate in, and contribute to, a larger public sphere. This study explores these media organizations and the work they do in relation to the larger market-oriented society, and mainstream media landscape, in which they exist. ^ My study highlights the importance of locating community and youth-produced media within this context – a context which, I argue, both constrains opportunities for non-commercial public media to be broadcast to a wider audience and yet creates an increasingly inequitable social and economic environment where non-commercial media that speak to issues of local concern are needed. My research finds that the meanings and purposes that guide the youth of my study in their media production both contest and reflect facets of a market-based ideology that privileges the commercial, private, and corporate over that of the public. In a larger society where public space is increasingly monitored, controlled and/or privatized, youth participants overwhelmingly recognize and greatly appreciate the unique and relatively unrestricted communal space that both of these media organizations offer. However, in this non-commercial media space that aims to educate young people to produce and consume media grounded in youth and community concerns as a means to generate civic interest and participation in social and political issues, some youth value their media education primarily for its private utility – namely, the possibilities for career development and advancement it provides – rather than for its potential to contribute to a community knowledge base and serve a larger public aim. ^ My study also finds that in an organization where 2 ̆ 7 youth voice 2 ̆ 7 is not critically examined, young people may at times create media texts that reproduce sexist, homophobic, and other marginalizing perspectives, as youth themselves have grown up in a society wrought with these prejudices and are shaped by the institutions, social histories, and interactions they share with adults. In this way, my research cautions against misunderstanding the potential for new digital technologies alone to be social change agents, and I highlight the need for youth media organizations to include a critical and continually-reflective content development component to their media education programs. This study explores the possibilities and challenges of teaching young people to produce public non-commercial media in an <b>increasingly</b> market-oriented, <b>privatized,</b> and commercial world. ...|$|R
40|$|Overview of IPR {{regimes in}} East Africa These laws, which are WIPO or UPOV compliant, focus on formal innovators, who {{represent}} {{just one of}} the components of the innovation system. Private investment in R&D in East Africa is limited. In the field of agriculture much of the R&D is carried out by public institutions, which are financed by the public for the public good, so that little or no consideration has been given to IPRs. With liberalization and the call for more public-private partnerships, however, the situation is changing. IPRs are now being given greater consideration in biotechnology R&D, in view of increasing private sector involvement in collaborative partnerships with public research institutions. East African countries have decided in principle to accept biotechnology products, and the growing number of public-private partnerships has influenced them to develop legal frameworks to govern the development and release of these products to the environment. Kenya is more advanced than other countries in this respect, and has created legal systems to evaluate applications for the development and release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Because of the high costs of patents and the need for technology transfer, the African Agricultural Technology Fund (AATF) has recently been established in Nairobi to act as a broker to help Africa acquire biotechnology products. The AATF will be funded by USAID, the Rockefeller Foundation and DFID. According to the project briefs, the AATF will bear liability for any possible negative impacts of GMOs in future. Legal arrangements for the products of biotechnology R&D in Kenya This section describes the legal arrangements underpinning a number of research partnerships in Kenya. The Netherlands-Kenya biotechnology programme. The funding agreement explicitly states that any invention resulting from the programme will be owned by the researchers and the implementing institution. However, the product will be made available free of royalties to small-scale farmers in Kenya or other countries where the Netherlands government believes that the product will be of use. So far, some livestock vaccines and drought-tolerant, insect pest resistant maize lines show promise for patenting. However, with the recent termination of the contract it may not be possible for the local public institutions involved to adhere to this agreement. The Insect Resistant Maize for Africa (IRMA) project, a partnership between the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute (KARI), funded by the Syngenta Foundation, aims to develop a new variety of Bt maize. In the partnership agreement, Syngenta has indicated that it has no interest in co-owning the product, so that the onus is on CIMMYT and KARI who will own the product. Because of liberalization, and the Kenyan government´s insistence that parastatal organizations generate their own resources, KARI is likely to patent or co-own the product with CIMMYT, and will ask for royalties on the product. KARI, together with AATF and CIMMYT, will ultimately bear liability for potential negative impacts of the GMO produced. CIMMYT does not ask for royalties on the materials it supplies to companies. KARI and Monsanto have formed a partnership to develop Bt cotton and Bt maize using local varieties. The partnership agreement clearly spells out that KARI and Monsanto will own the products, but the decision on how the royalties will be shared will be made when the products are ready. In two projects, KARI is developing a transgenic sweet potato obtained from Monsanto and transgenic cassava from the Danforth Center (USA). The genes and technologies were donated to KARI through transactions brokered by ISAAA and the AATF, respectively.. In these cases KARI, ISAAA and the Danforth Center will bear liability for any eventual negative impacts of transgenic sweet potato and cassava, respectively. In the last three cases, material transfer agreements were signed between KARI and CIMMYT, Monsanto or its appointees, and the Danforth Center and Monsanto, respectively. The final agreement spelling out details as to who owns the products will be finalized by KARI and the partners. IPR and its impacts on agriculture In the area of biotechnology, IPRs represent an enormous challenge for policy makers and other stakeholders in Africa. While biotechnology offers new opportunities for Africa, in particular for addressing elusive goals such as food security and health, classical IPR systems threaten to undermine efforts to seize these opportunities if they are not properly articulated. Developments in this field in Africa have been determined and shaped by factors and events at the global level rather than in Africa itself. Hence legal, policy and institutional developments are not entirely in accordance with the desires or the abilities of African society. The legal instruments governing IPR were designed with the focus on the commercial sector, and do {{not take into account the}} situation of resource-poor farmers who produce, save, exchange, replant and sell planting materials at the local level. The 1978 UPOV Convention, upon which Kenya´s seed laws are based, recognized the rights of farmers to produce, save, exchange and replant their own seed, but it did not allow them to sell the seed. Worse still, the revised 1991 UPOV Convention covers biotechnology products and does not recognize farmers´ rights. This means that international agreements on which local laws are based do not fit well with the needs of the majority of small-scale local farmers. With regard to the patents for genetically modified organisms, the royalties are reflected in the high prices of the final products, such as seeds and chemicals, resulting in increased costs for farmers. These products are therefore beyond the reach of resource-poor farmers and subsequently may actually undermine local food production. Government plant breeding and biotechnology programmes depend largely on local genetic resources - on varieties of plants that have been bred and maintained by local farming communities over a long period. Existing laws do not recognize these efforts - the farmers´ varieties are treated as common domain property, while the varieties developed in research institutions (public or private) are <b>increasingly</b> becoming <b>privatized.</b> Further, bioprospecting activities have benefited the formal sector. The lack of awareness of IPR has resulted in the outright piracy of biological resources and plagiarism of the bioknowledge of local communities. Conclusions and recommendations Tailoring IPR systems to suit the local situation, and particularly that of resource-poor farmers (who are the majority), is an option that has been highlighted in many forums in East Africa. It has therefore been recommended that sui generis systems of IPRs be adopted that will take into consideration farmers´ rights, plant breeders´ rights, the need for conservation of genetic resources, the protection and utilization of indigenous knowledge and equitable benefit sharing. Uganda, for example, has developed a draft sui generis system that includes the above issues. The costs of the products of biotechnology are high due to IPRs. It is therefore recommended that brokers negotiate for concessions, particularly for local farming communities. The AATF has a key role to play in promoting biotechnology in Africa.
