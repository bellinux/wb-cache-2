Three identified metabolites {{resulting from the}} degradation of either acaricide, were 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid, 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone, and carbon dioxide. Chlorobenzilate, i. e., ethyl ester of 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid, was more easily hydrolyzed than Chloropropylate, i. e., isopropyl ester of this acid, so that larger amounts {{of carbon dioxide and}} 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone were obtained from Chlorobenzilate degradation. Regardless of acaricides used, longer incubation caused a higher accumulation of 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone. The probable steps of the degradation pathway are: Chlorobenzilate (or Chloropropylate) → 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid → 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone plus carbon dioxide. It appears that the decarboxylation of 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzilic acid to 4, 4 ′-dichlorobenzophenone was hindered by α-ketoglutarate and enhanced by succinate...|$|R

Together these enzymes degrade phosphatidylcholine to free choline, inorganic phosphate, and sn- 1, 2 -diacylglycerol. Both enzymes have pH optima around 5. 0. The enzymes are present in fully imbibed cotyledons and increase in activity during seedling growth. Fractionation of cotyledon extracts on sucrose gradients showed that the cells contain two PA phosphatases. One enzyme with a pH optimum of 7. 5 has the same distribution on sucrose gradient as the endoplasmic reticulum marker enzyme NADH-cytochrome c reductase. The other, PA phosphatase, with a pH optimum of 5. 0, was present in a protein body-rich fraction and in the load portion of the gradient. Fractionation of broken protoplasts on Ficoll gradients (a method which allows for the isolation of {{a high proportion of}} intact protein bodies) indicates that most of the cellular phospholipase D and PA phosphatase (pH 5. 0) are associated with the protein bodies.

Moreover, clinical evaluation proved the efficacy and tolerability of this preparation in the treatment of various topical fungal infections...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} urea-derived heterocycles, 5 N-substituted hexahydro- 1, 3, 5 -triazin- 2 -ones, has been {{prepared}} and their structures have been determined {{for the first}} time. This family of compounds only differ in their substituent at the 5 -position (which {{is derived from the}} corresponding primary amine), that is, methyl (1), ethyl (2), <b>isopropyl</b> (3), tert-butyl (<b>4),</b> benzyl (5), N,N-(diethyl) ethylamine (6), and 2 -hydroxyethyl (7). The common heterocyclic core of these molecules is a cyclic urea, which has the potential to form a hydrogen-bonding tape motif that consists of self-associative equation image(8) dimers. The results from X-ray crystallography and, where possible, Laue neutron crystallography show that the hydrogen-bonding motifs that are observed and the planarity of the hydrogen bonds appear to depend on the steric hindrance at the α-carbon atom of the N substituent. With the less-hindered substituents, methyl and ethyl, the anticipated tape motif is observed. When additional methyl groups are added onto the α-carbon atom, as in the isopropyl and tert-butyl derivatives, a different 2 D hydrogen-bonding motif is observed. Despite the bulkiness of the substituents, the benzyl and N,N-(diethyl) ethylamine derivatives have methylene units at the α-carbon atom and, therefore, display the tape motif. The introduction of a competing hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor in the 2 -hydroxyethyl derivative disrupts the tape motif, with a hydroxy group interrupting the N[BOND]H⋅⋅⋅O[DOUBLE BOND]C interactions. The geometry around the hydrogen-bearing nitrogen atoms, whether planar or non-planar, has been confirmed for compounds 2 and 5 by using Laue neutron diffraction and rationalized by using computational methods, thus demonstrating that distortion of O-C-N-H torsion angles occurs to maintain almost-linear hydrogen-bonding interactions...|$|R
40|$|Navel {{oranges and}} Clementine {{mandarin}} {{are classified as}} early cultivars and when fruits are left on the trees, fruit firmness and juice content will decrease. Plant growth regulators {{have been used to}} improve fruit quality. Gibberellic acid (GA 3) and 2, <b>4</b> -D <b>isopropyl</b> ester sprays were used to increase juice content,peel firmness and delay senescence in Navel oranges and Clementine mandarin. Factorial experiments were arranged in a complete randomized block design with three replications and each block consisted of three trees. Chemicals were sprayed on the branches (north and south of each tree) with 10 liter sprayer to the point of run-off during fall of 2004 and 2005,in a commercial orchard in Jahrom in the south east of Fars province, Iran. In both years of study, GA 3 at 100, 150 and 200 mgl-l and <b>isopropyl</b> ester 2, <b>4</b> -D at 8, 12 and 24 mgl- 1 were sprayed on September 30 (diameter of Navel 64 mm and diameter of Clementine 46 mm), October 14 (diameter of Navel 69 mm and diameter of Clementine 48 mm) and November 7 (diameter of Navel 70 mm and diameter of Clementine 50 mm) and fruits of Navel oranges and Clementine mandarin were harvested 45 and 35 days after last the spray treatment, respectively. The results of experiment revealed that Navel oranges responded better with second application (Oct. 14, diameter 69 mm) and Clementine mandarin with the first application (Sept. 30, diameter 46 mm). Juice content and fruit firmness at harvest increased. GA 3 increased juice content even better than 2, <b>4</b> -D <b>isopropyl</b> ester but delayed senescence, 2, 4 -D was more effective in increasing fruit sizing in both cultivars. GA 3 at 150 and 200 mgl- 1 and 2, 4 -D at 24 mgl- 1 when compared with the untreated resulted in highest juice content of fruits...|$|R
30|$|A 0.3 -M PZT sol-gel {{precursor}} {{with the}} molar ratio of 1 : 0.52 : 0.48 was prepared by dissolving zirconium propoxide (Zr(CH 2 CH 2 CH 3 O) <b>4)</b> and <b>isopropyl</b> titanate (Ti(C <b>4</b> H 9 O) 4) into 2 -methoxyethanol (C 3 H 8 O 2), with acetic acid and propanol added as the solvents, stirring until completely dissolved. Then, 10  % excess lead acetate trihydrate (Pb(CH 3 CO 2) 2 · 3 H 2 O) was added {{with the purpose}} of compensating the lead loss and preventing forming the second phase of pyrochlore-type in annealing process [27]. The precursor solution was stirred for 24  h at room temperature and then aged for 1  week. The PZT sol was dipped into the AAO template for nearly 10  h at the room temperature for atmosphere pressure. After infiltration, excess PZT accumulated on the surface is swept with nitrogen gas gun. The samples were then annealed at 700  °C for 20  min in air by a rapid thermal process (RTP) to experience a crystallization process. Afterwards, in an ambient pressure of 5.6 [*]×[*] 10 − 4  mbar at room temperature, the specimen was etched by Ar IBE (MIBE- 150 C). The first 10 -min IBE was used to remove off the residual PZT film that covered on the surface of AAO template after the annealing process. The continuous IBE reduced both the thicknesses of the AAO and inside PZT. The total etching time was about 20  min with a vertical incident ion beam to the specimen. The etching energy was set to a cathode current of 11.5 A, anode voltage of 55  V, plate voltage of 300  V, ion accelerating voltage of 250  V, and neutralization current of 13 A and bias current of 1.2 A. After the IBE process, the remaining AAO was completely removed off by dipping the specimen into sodium hydroxide solution.|$|R
