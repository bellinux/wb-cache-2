6000|$|With sails abaft, {{the engine}} stopt, the vessel {{remained}} unwillingly stationary, until, after an hour's search, my poor Perdita was brought on board. But no care could re-animate her, no medicine cause her dear eyes to open, {{and the blood}} to flow again from her pulseless heart. One clenched hand contained a slip of paper, on which was written, [...] "To Athens." [...] To ensure her removal thither, and prevent the <b>irrecoverable</b> <b>loss</b> of her body in the wide sea, she had had the precaution to fasten a long shawl round her waist, and again to the staunchions of the cabin window. She had drifted somewhat under the keel of the vessel, and her being out of sight occasioned the delay in finding her. And thus the ill-starred girl died a victim to my senseless rashness. Thus, in early day, she left us for {{the company of the}} dead, and preferred to share the rocky grave of Raymond, before the animated scene this cheerful earth afforded, and the society of loving friends. Thus in her twenty-ninth year she died; having enjoyed some few years of the happiness of paradise, and sustaining a reverse to which her impatient spirit and affectionate disposition were unable to submit. As I marked the placid expression that had settled on her countenance in death, I felt, in spite of the pangs of remorse, in spite of heart-rending regret, that it was better to die so, than to drag on long, miserable years of repining and inconsolable grief. Stress of weather drove us up the Adriatic Gulph; and, our vessel being hardly fitted to weather a storm, we took refuge in the port of Ancona. Here I met Georgio Palli, the vice-admiral of the Greek fleet, a former friend and warm partizan of Raymond. I committed the remains of my lost Perdita to his care, for the purpose of having them transported to Hymettus, and placed in the cell her Raymond already occupied beneath the pyramid. This was all accomplished even as I wished. She reposed beside her beloved, and the tomb above was inscribed with the united names of Raymond and Perdita.|$|E

50|$|Ghanshyam Swarup, {{while working}} with Stanley Cohen in the US on {{cellular}} signaling mechanisms, {{is reported to}} have discovered a new nuclear protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) and his subsequent work demonstrated that the protein plays a part in the regulation of cell proliferation.

His studies are known to have assisted in identifying the first cargo (PTP-S4/TC48) for the putative cargo receptors in mammalian cells. He has established a laboratory, Ghanshyam Swarup Group, where his team focuses on researches on protein optineurin and how disease-associated mutation affect humans. Associated with L. V.

President Lincoln had delivered Farragut an ultimatum before his departure - a defeat in the Chesapeake would be an <b>irrecoverable</b> <b>loss,</b> and the Union {{would be forced to}} concede defeat. The two submersibles USS Shark and USS Dolphin left Fortress Monroe at midnight on May 6, and at 7:20 am on May 7, British picket ships spotted the Union fleet sallying out to battle. Hope had arranged his floating batteries and gunboats in a thick hedge some sixty strong {{directly in front of the}} American fleet in order to disrupt it with sheer volume of firepower while six gunboats had the role of ramming and boarding monitors, dubbed [...] "Bazalgetting". Behind the hedge of small vessels, Hope divided his ships into three divisions: a central division of the seven ironclads and the ship-of-the-line, and two divisions flanking the center made up of frigates, corvettes, and sloops. Farragut arranged his ships in four parallel lines, the easternmost line made up seven frigates and sloops and the other three all ironclads. At 9:45 am, Farragut made contact with the British hedge vessels, and the British guns focused on the leading monitors to virtually no effect, but the XV-inch and XI-inch Dahlgren guns shattered the densely packed floating batteries and gunboats. The [...] "Bazalgetting" [...] gunboats steamed towards the monitors, and two gunboats aimed for USS Dictator, but were blown to pieces by the Dictators twin XV-inch guns. On the tail end of Farragut's left column, two [...] "Bazalgetting" [...] gunboats targeted the smaller USS Sangamon, and managed to ride the deck of the Passaic-class monitor, but one gunboat was shot at from short range by the Sangamon and destroyed. While the Sangamons turret rotated to reload, the other gunboat managed to fire into the open aperture and ignite the powder bags, killing the USS Sangamon.|$|E

40|$|Path {{diversity}} {{works by}} setting up multiple parallel connections between the end points using the topological path redundancy of the network. In this paper, Forward Error Correction (FEC) is applied across multiple independent paths to enhance the endto-end reliability. Internet paths are modeled as erasure Gilbert-Elliot channels [1], [2]. First, it is shown that over any erasure channel, Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes achieve the minimum probability of <b>irrecoverable</b> <b>loss</b> among all block codes of the same size. Then, based on the adopted model for Internet paths, we prove that the probability of <b>irrecoverable</b> <b>loss</b> for MDS codes decays exponentially for the asymptotically large number of paths. Moreover, it is shown that in the optimal rate allocation, each path is assigned a positive rate iff its quality is above a certain threshold. The quality of a path {{is defined as the}} percentage of the time it spends in the bad state. In other words, including a redundant path improves the reliability iff this condition is satisfied. Finally, using dynamic programming, a heuristic suboptimal algorithm with polynomial runtime is proposed for rate allocation over the available paths. This algorithm converges to the asymptotically optimal rate allocation when the number of paths is large. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm approximates the optimal rate allocation very closely for the practical number of paths, and provides significant performance improvement compared to the alternative schemes of rate allocation...|$|E

30|$|This embedding, however, is not invertible. Since the {{quantization}} is {{altered to}} a coarser level {{as part of}} data embedding, it causes <b>irrecoverable</b> <b>loss</b> of data. For a single bit embedding, the maximum quantization noise doubles {{compared to that of}} without embedding. Beside the irreversible changes to the coefficient, the modified reference frame in the motion loop propagates the effect of data hiding into future frames, making the changes permanent. This implies that the reconstructed video will be slightly different from the originally compressed version. Such an irreversible embedding method is not suitable for certain applications that demand the original video to be unaltered by the data hiding process.|$|E

40|$|Drainage and {{deforestation}} turned Southeast (SE) Asian peat soils into a globally important CO 2 source, {{because both}} processes accelerate peat decomposition. Carbon losses through soil leaching {{have so far}} not been quantified and the underlying processes have hardly been studied. In this study, we use results derived from nine expeditions to six Sumatran rivers and a mixing model to determine leaching processes in tropical peat soils, which are heavily disturbed by drainage and deforestation. Here we show that a reduced evapotranspiration and the resulting increased freshwater discharge in addition to the supply of labile leaf litter produced by re-growing secondary forests increase leaching of carbon by ~ 200 %. Enhanced freshwater fluxes and leaching of labile leaf litter from secondary vegetation appear to contribute 38 % and 62 % to the total increase, respectively. Decomposition of leached labile DOC can lead to hypoxic conditions in rivers draining disturbed peatlands.
