25|$|The Express Rail Link, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Regional Express, which will connect Kowloon with the territory's border with China, explored different technologies and designs in its planning stage, between Maglev and conventional <b>highspeed</b> railway, and if the latter was chosen, between a dedicated new route and sharing the tracks with the existing West Rail. Finally conventional <b>highspeed</b> with dedicated new route was chosen. It {{is expected to be}} operational in 2018.|$|E
25|$|The {{region was}} established, along with ten other megaregions {{throughout}} the United States, by America 2050 {{in response to}} President Barack Obama’s {{efforts to improve the}} country’s infrastructure. The megaregions were initially identified by America 2050 as areas that should have <b>highspeed</b> rail by 2050. According to America 2050’s four phase plan the Front Range would have <b>highspeed</b> rail on Phase 3 of the plan and the line would stretch from Denver, Colorado to Albuquerque, New Mexico.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to {{standardize}} aircraft types, the USAF was directed to conduct Operation <b>Highspeed,</b> a flyoff competition between the USAF F-106A and the U.S. Navy F4H-1 (F-4B) Phantom, which was not only as capable as the F-106 as a missile-armed interceptor, but could also carry as large a bomb load as the Republic F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bomber. The Phantom was the winner, but would first be tasked to escort and later replace the F-105 fighter-bomber in the late 1960s before replacing older interceptors in Air Defense Command in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Daegu is {{the hub of}} the Korean inland {{railroad}} traffic. The main railroad of the country, Gyeongbu Line {{passes through}} the city. The largest railroad station in the city, Dongdaegu Station has the second largest passenger traffic in Korea after Seoul Station, and the largest train traffic. The station re-opened in 2004 after extensive renovations serving the KTX <b>highspeed</b> train, Saemaul and Mugunghwa trains. All kinds of trains except KTX depart from Daegu Station, an all-new building with cinemas, restaurants and a department store, located near the city centre. It has the tenth largest passenger traffic in Korea. Daegu Line branches off from Gacheon Station of Gyeongbu Line.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1930s, {{streamlined}} <b>highspeed</b> diesel railcars {{were developed}} in several countries: ...|$|E
2500|$|In Germany, the Flying Hamburger {{was built}} in 1932. After a test ride in December 1932, this two coach diesel railcar (in English {{terminology}} a DMU2) started service at Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG) in February 1933. It became the prototype of DRG Class SVT 137 with 33 more <b>highspeed</b> DMUs, built for DRG till 1938, 13 DMU 2 ("Hamburg" [...] series), 18 DMU 3 ("Leipzig" [...] and [...] "Köln" [...] series), and 2 DMU 4 ("Berlin" [...] series).|$|E
2500|$|... 3) Prismatic {{coefficient}} (Cp) is {{the volume}} (V) divided by Lpp x Ax. It displays {{the ratio of}} the immersed volume of the hull to a volume of a prism with equal length to the ship and cross-sectional area equal to the largest underwater section of the hull (midship section). This is used to evaluate the distribution of the volume of the underbody. A low or fine Cp indicates a full mid-section and fine ends, a high or full Cp indicates a boat with fuller ends. Planing hulls and other <b>highspeed</b> hulls tend towards a higher Cp. Efficient displacement hulls travelling at a low Froude number will tend to have a low Cp.|$|E
2500|$|Basel {{has long}} held an {{important}} {{place as a}} rail hub. Three railway stations — those of the German, French and Swiss networks — lie within the city (although the Swiss (Basel SBB) and French (Bâle SNCF) stations are actually in the same complex, separated by Customs and Immigration facilities). Basel Badischer Bahnhof is {{on the opposite side}} of the city. Basel's local rail services are supplied by the Basel Regional S-Bahn. The largest goods railway complex of the country [...] is located just outside the city, spanning the municipalities of Muttenz and Pratteln. The new <b>highspeed</b> ICE railway line from Karlsruhe to Basel was completed in 2008 while phase I of the TGV Rhin-Rhône line, opened in December 2011, has reduced travel time from Basel to Paris to about 3 hours.|$|E
2500|$|Tatum {{continued}} to shuttle passengers between Chinese ports until mid-April 1946. On the 12th, she {{stood out of}} Hong Kong {{to return to the}} United States. After stops at Guam, in the Marshalls, and at Pearl Harbor, the ship reached San Pedro, California, on 9 May 1946. On the 18th, she resumed her voyage east and arrived at Philadelphia, Pa., on 3 June. By 5 July, she was in the Charleston (S.C.) Navy Yard undergoing inactivation overhaul. In mid-October, the <b>highspeed</b> transport was towed to Green Cove Springs, Florida where she was placed out of commission on 15 November 1946. Tatum remained out of commission, in reserve, until 1 June 1960 when her name was struck from the Navy List. On 8 May 1961, she was sold for scrap to the Southern Scrap Metal Co., New Orleans, Louisiana ...|$|E
2500|$|On 31 December Robinson and {{the five}} other destroyers of DesRon 22 sailed from Seeadler Harbor in the screen for Transport Group [...] "Able" [...] of the Lingayen Attack Force, {{carrying}} the 27th Infantry Division for the initial landings at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, in the Philippines. Robinson screened northwest of the transport area {{on the morning of}} 9 January 1945 as the first waves of amphibious assault troops landed. She anchored in the transport area that night and survived a pre-dawn attack by a Japanese suicide boat. The underwater explosions temporarily put her sonar equipment out of commission but did no other serious damage. At daybreak, Robinsons gunners fought off a diving kamikaze suicide plane and knocked it down in a spinning ball of flame. At dusk she opened fire on another suicide plane diving at a <b>highspeed</b> transport. That enemy missed its target and crashed into the sea. Robinson returned to Leyte Gulf with the empty transports on the 15th.|$|E
2500|$|Prime Minister José Sócrates and his {{government}} team supported the decision of building new transportation infrastructure such as a new airport for Lisbon and a TGV network. For months the government of Prime Minister José Sócrates insisted the country's only option for a new airport was in the Ota region north of Lisbon. But a powerful lobby, headed by local business honchos and given the imprimatur of the Portuguese president Aníbal Cavaco Silva, forced Sócrates's Government into reversal, by bringing an alternative site for the new airport – the Portuguese Air Force's shooting range in Alcochete east of Lisbon. A study commissioned {{by a group of}} businesspeople said the Alcochete site would save taxpayers as much as €3bn in construction costs, and would have less of an environmental impact. The government argued that Ota was a key piece of its overall transport strategy, which included <b>highspeed</b> rail lines to Spain, but even so recognized that the project wasn't finalized and that a debate on {{the pros and cons of}} both sites would be worthwhile. Then the government commissioned a technical study to the state-run civil engineering laboratory (...) comparing both locations one to each other. Following the conclusions of that study, on 10 January 2008 the Prime Minister José Sócrates announced the option Alcochete as the most rational choice for a new airport for Lisbon.|$|E
