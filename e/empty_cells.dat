25|$|M. flavitarsis nests {{are often}} invaded by moths (Chalcoela iphitalis) at night because the wasps cannot see them. The moths migrate among the cells {{consuming}} wasp larvae and pupae. They will then lay their larvae, which spin cocoons in <b>empty</b> <b>cells.</b> M. flavitarsis do {{not attempt to}} rid the nest of the parasite. Instead, they will continue as a nest or abandon and renest elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to remove a key–value pair from the dictionary. However, it {{is not sufficient to}} do so by simply <b>emptying</b> its <b>cell.</b> This would affect searches for other keys that have a hash value earlier than the <b>emptied</b> <b>cell,</b> but that are stored in a position later than the <b>emptied</b> <b>cell.</b> The <b>emptied</b> <b>cell</b> would cause those searches to incorrectly report that the key is not present.|$|R

25|$|These {{behavioral}} {{divisions are}} not permanent. For instance, if an alpha female {{is removed from}} a nest, then another female, usually the second-most dominant, beta female, assumes the role and behavioral profile of the removed dominant. Indeed, individuals alternate between different profiles of behavior within their own dominance rank position. When larvae were artificially removed, the frequency of worker reproduction increased. Therefore, workers lay eggs when they perceive a decline in queen power, as demonstrated by artificially <b>empty</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E
25|$|The drones' main {{function}} is {{to be ready to}} fertilize a receptive queen. Drones in a hive do not usually mate with a virgin queen of the same hive because they drift from hive to hive. Mating generally takes place in or near drone congregation areas. How these areas are selected is poorly understood, but they do exist. When a drone mates with a queen, the resultant queen will have a spotty brood pattern (numerous <b>empty</b> <b>cells</b> on a brood frame) due to the removal of diploid drone larvae by nurse bees (i.e., a fertilized egg with two identical sex genes will develop into a drone instead of a worker).|$|E
25|$|Sphagnum is a genus of {{approximately}} 380 accepted species of mosses, {{commonly known as}} peat moss. Accumulations of Sphagnum can store water, since both living and dead plants can hold large quantities of water inside their cells; plants may hold 16–26 times as much water as their dry weight, depending on the species. The <b>empty</b> <b>cells</b> help retain water in drier conditions. Hence, as sphagnum moss grows, it can slowly spread into drier conditions, forming larger mires, both raised bogs and blanket bogs. These peat accumulations then provide habitat for {{a wide array of}} peatland plants, including sedges and ericaceous shrubs, as well as orchids and carnivorous plants. Sphagnum and the peat formed from it do not decay readily because of the phenolic compounds embedded in the moss's cell walls. In addition, bogs, like all wetlands, develop anaerobic soil conditions, which produces slower anaerobic decay rather than aerobic microbial action. Peat moss can also acidify its surroundings by taking up cations, such as calcium and magnesium, and releasing hydrogen ions. Under the right conditions, peat can accumulate to a depth of many meters. Different species of Sphagnum have different tolerance limits for flooding and pH, so any one peatland may have a number of different Sphagnum species.|$|E

500|$|Instead, when a <b>cell</b> [...] is <b>emptied,</b> it is {{necessary}} to search forward through the following cells of the table until finding either another <b>empty</b> <b>cell</b> or a key that can be moved to cell [...] (that is, a key whose hash value is equal to or earlier than [...] ). When an <b>empty</b> <b>cell</b> is found, then <b>emptying</b> <b>cell</b> [...] is safe and the deletion process terminates. But, when the search finds a key that can be moved to cell , it performs this move. This has the effect of speeding up later searches for the moved key, but it also <b>empties</b> out another <b>cell,</b> later in the same block of occupied cells. The search for a movable key continues for the new <b>emptied</b> <b>cell,</b> in the same way, until it terminates by reaching a cell that was already empty. In this process of moving keys to earlier cells, each key is examined only once. Therefore, the time to complete the whole process is proportional to the length of the block of occupied cells containing the deleted key, matching the running time of the other hash table operations.|$|R
500|$|The most {{important}} gold {{item in the}} hoard is the body chain, which consists of four finely looped gold chains, made using the [...] "loop-in-loop" [...] method called [...] "fox tail" [...] in modern jewellery, and attached at front and back to plaques. At the front, the chains have terminals {{in the shape of}} lions' heads and the plaque has jewels mounted in gold cells, with a large amethyst surrounded by four smaller garnets alternating with four <b>empty</b> <b>cells,</b> which probably held pearls that have decayed. At the back, the chains meet at a mount centred on a gold solidus of Gratian (r. 375–383), which has been converted from an earlier use, probably as a pendant, and which may have been a family heirloom. Body chains of this type appear in Roman art, sometimes on the goddess Venus or nymphs; some examples have erotic contexts, but they are also worn by respectable high-ranking ladies. They may have been regarded as a suitable gift for a bride. The Hoxne body chain, worn tightly, would fit a woman with a bust-size of [...] Few body chains have survived; one of the most complete, from the early Byzantine era and found in Egypt, is also in the British Museum.|$|E

In this situation, the neighbour below (not the one to the right) has to be slid into the <b>empty</b> <b>cell.</b> A similar change is needed in the definition of an outward slide (where one has to choose the neighbor above).

2500|$|A {{brute force}} {{algorithm}} visits the <b>empty</b> <b>cells</b> in some order, filling in digits sequentially, or backtracking when the number {{is found to be}} not valid. Briefly, a program would solve a puzzle by placing the digit [...] "1" [...] in the first cell and checking if it is allowed to be there. If there are no violations (checking row, column, and box constraints) then the algorithm advances to the next cell, and places a [...] "1" [...] in that cell. When checking for violations, if it is discovered that the [...] "1" [...] is not allowed, the value is advanced to [...] "2". If a cell is discovered where none of the 9 digits is allowed, then the algorithm leaves that cell blank and moves back to the previous cell. The value in that cell is then incremented by one. This is repeated until the allowed value in the last (81st) cell is discovered.|$|E
