A terminus was needed and the town of Sanger offered the company 65 acres adjacent to railroad access. On August 29, 1889 the company agreed to the purchase and started construction. Smith originally planned to build a railroad to transport lumber down the mountains but instead built a log flume. It was constructed by between the years of 1889 and 1890. On September 3, 1890, 2500 people attended [...] "Flumeopolis", a celebration and barbecue to mark the completion of the flume. The log flume was 62 miles (100 km) in length, as tall as 300 feet. The flume transported lumber from three mills in the Sierra Nevada Mountains parallel to the Kings River to a lumber yard in Sanger, California. Along the route 11 [...] "flume houses" [...] were built where people known as [...] "flume herders" [...] kept the flume clear of blockages and reported any damage to the flume. Two of the mills were at the headwaters of the Kings River and one was in Millwood, in the upper Kings River region. The three mills operated ten hours a day employing 300 men and had a capacity of 3 million feet of lumber per month. An additional 200 men worked for the company in Sanger at a box factory, door and sash factory, planing mill and <b>drying</b> <b>yard.</b> The company operated rail lines for transporting lumber as well as oxen known as [...] "Heart Bulls".

40|$|Drying is {{the first}} and most {{important}} step in the process of wood industrialization and it aims to provide material with suitable characteristics for use. This operation must be planned and conducted the right way, because it determines the final product quality. This study aimed to characterize the drying process of wood made in sawmills in the city of Sinop, Mato Grosso, through qualitative and quantitative parameters, and identify common aspects and possible failures in the process.

Em uma lavoura da {{cultivar}} Acaiá Cerrado, foram sorteadas, ao acaso, dezoito parcelas com trinta metros de comprimento. A colheita foi realizada quando a lavoura apresentava aproximadamente 20 % de frutos verdes. Um terço do café derriçado de cada parcela era formado pela mistura de frutos provenientes da lavoura. O restante do café foi lavado e separado em frutos-bóia e verde/cereja. Os diferentes tipos de café foram colocados no terreiro de secagem até atingirem o teor de água de 11 % (b. u.). Após a secagem, o café foi beneficiado e submetido às seguintes avaliações: polifenóis, açúcares totais, redutores e não-redutores, sólidos solúveis totais, acidez titulável total e prova de xícara. Analisando os resultados obtidos, apesar de terem sido observadas diferenças significativas entre os valores médios de polifenóis, açúcares, sólidos solúveis e acidez titulável para os diferentes sistemas de colheita, não foi possível estabelecer uma associação definida entre sistema de colheita e composição química. Não foi possível também distinguir, a partir da prova de xícara, diferenças na qualidade do café em função do sistema de colheita, pois, todas as amostras analisadas apresentaram bebida classificada como mole, apenas mole e dura.

The present work was developed on the Rancho Fundo farm, Campos Gerais town, MG, in the Food Science Department of the UFLA and in the “Centro Tecnológico do Sul de Minas” of EPAMIG. In a crop of the Acaiá Cerrado cultivars were randomized eighteen plots with thirty meters long each. The harvest was performed when the crop was presenting about 20 % of green fruits. A third of the ripped coffee from each plot was maintained with the mixture of fruit from the crop. The rest of the coffee was washed and separated in float and green/cherry fruits.

40|$|The {{effect of}} seasons and sticker {{thickness}} on Sclerocarya birrea (Humied) wood drying in Kadogli area, South Kordofan State, Sudan. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the variation between seasons (autumn, winter and summer) and sticker thickness on the air drying of Sclerocarya birrea (humied) wood. The study was undertaken in Kadogli Town, South Kordofan State. The wood material was collected from mature and healthy trees growing in Kegga-jerro natural forest. The logs were cut from three hundred and ten trees, about 30 cm above the surface of ground. The logs were flat-sawn, 1080 planks were prepared and 360 planks were used in each season. The stacks of the wood were piled on the <b>drying</b> <b>yard,</b> loaded on a firm foundation, built by using bricks, cement and sand. Nine stacks were piled for the study, three stacks in each season, using three sticker sizes (1. 25 cm, 2. 5 cm and 3. 75 cm). Each stack was built using 120 randomly selected planks, which were sawn in equal dimensions of about 5 cm × 15 cm× 200 cm. Each stack was divided into fifteen rows and each row consists of eight planks Fifty four test blocks, measuring 2. 5 cm× 5 cm× 15 cm, were cut from twenty seven sample planks, about 30 cm from either end of the planks to determine the initial moisture content using the oven dry method. The data were obtained by weighting the twenty seven sample planks which were randomly selected and placed in three different locations within the drying stacks (three sample planks in each stack) every three days until a constant weight was attained. The relationship between the moisture content and the drying time (days) was investigated using regression analysis. Although this relationship could be significantly explained by second, third or fourth-order polynomial equations, the fourth order had the best fit. The statistical analysis of variance indicated 5 that there were significant differences between the trends of the relationship between the seasons (autumn, summer and winter) in terms of the equilibrium moisture content and the drying time. Summer had the highest equilibrium moisture content and longest drying time compared with autumn and winter seasons. No significant differences were found among sticker thicknesses in the equilibrium moisture content and the drying time. The percentage of warping defect was higher in winter season than the other two seasons, while the magnitude of the warped planks was greater in autumn. However, the percentage of surface-checked planks was greater in summer than in winter and autumn, while the percentage of end-checked planks was very high in autumn compared with winter and summer. The high number and percentage of drying defect was expected to be associated with stacks for sticker 3. 75 cm thickness, but the defect was found unevenly distributed between the three sticker sizes. The magnitude of drying defects (warping, checking) and the numbers of the defected planks indicate that Sclerocarya birrea wood can successfully be air-dried, with acceptable level of drying...|$|E

Each apartment was placed so each family would receive maximum sunlight and air. The buildings would’ve also occupied 22% less land, creating more open space around each building. More space meant more things to do with the landscaping. Tullgren’s plan for the outside included a sunken garden cour, pool, flower garden, shaded lawn, and promenade. There would have also been a playground area for small children between the buildings, and facilities for larger children. The playground would’ve included the usual playground equipment like swings, sand pits, shallow wading pools, and a camp-fire space.
