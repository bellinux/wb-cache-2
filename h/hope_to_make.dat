However, due to border disputes between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the integration process in Tajikistan has stalled. Both countries exchanged fire in December 2013 and August 2014, which resulted in casualties. Both countries have since announced they would resolve conflicts and improve border cooperation.

5|$|Hope is a Symbolist oil {{painting}} by the English painter George Frederic Watts, {{who completed the}} first two versions in 1886. Radically different from previous treatments of the subject, it shows a lone blindfolded female figure sitting on a globe, playing a lyre that has only a single string remaining. The background is almost blank, its only visible feature a single star. Watts intentionally used symbolism not traditionally associated with <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the painting's meaning ambiguous. While his use of colour in Hope was greatly admired, {{at the time of}} its exhibition many critics disliked the painting. Hope proved popular with the Aesthetic Movement, who considered beauty the primary purpose of art and were unconcerned by the ambiguity of its message. Reproductions in platinotype, and later cheap carbon prints, soon began to be sold.|$|E
5|$|Rosecroft {{was sold}} to Mark Vogel in 1987. Vogel made several {{mistakes}} that hurt the horse racing industry in Maryland. Three years later, {{he was arrested for}} possession of cocaine, and his company went into bankruptcy. Rosecroft {{was sold to}} Weisman's Colt Enterprises in 1991. In that same year, the grandstand caught fire and was reconstructed in 1993 for $3.6 million. In 1995, after losing millions, the relatives of Weisman sold Rosecroft to Cloverleaf Enterprises. In the 2000s, Cloverleaf attempted to sell Rosecroft multiple times, but due to lawsuits and politics, all the potential buyers became uninterested. Nearby states legalized casinos to help their racetracks. Money generated from the casinos was used to increase the purses and handle (daily betting turnover), and Rosecroft was unable to produce the same amount of money. After filing for bankruptcy once again, Rosecroft Raceway closed down in 2010. The next year, Penn National Gaming purchased the racetrack with the <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it a racino, and Rosecroft reopened in 2011.|$|E

25|$|Increased {{investment}} in public transportation, however, {{has not changed}} the fact that San Juan is an automobile-reliant city and its fast growth has sparked urban sprawl. As of mid-2010, the government has approved plans for a redesign of this Puerto Rican city, featuring a new mass transit system, new roads and intersections, and more beach-access points. No cars will be allowed inside the oldest part of city (Old San Juan). The plans hope to remedy previous poor urban planning in the oldest section of the city, the Isleta, while curbing reliance on motor vehicles. The plans for redevelopment also <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the city more appealing {{in order to attract}} new residents, as San Juan has suffered from a shrinking population over the past 60 years.|$|E

[...] "I'm still fighting hard and I still <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it to the Brier, not playing but talking. For Saskatchewan, I was hoping to be in your green shoes (at the Scott).

And I'll see you all in Sudbury (the next Scott site) in 2001. Your curling friend, Sandra." [...] However, the optimism in her statement belied the seriousness of her condition.

The chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, Hilary A. Herbert, stated to Congress: [...] "if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid-ocean and confronted by Riachuelo it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the American flag would get into port." [...] These developments helped bring to a head a series of discussions that had been taking place at the Naval Advisory Board since 1881. The board knew {{at that time that}} the U.S. Navy could not challenge any major European fleet; at best, it could wear down an opponent's merchant fleet and <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> some progress through general attrition there. Moreover, projecting naval force abroad through the use of battleships ran counter to the government policy of isolationism. While some on the board supported a strict policy of commerce raiding, others argued it would be ineffective against the potential threat of enemy battleships stationed near the American coast. The two sides remained essentially deadlocked until Riachuelo manifested.|$|E
