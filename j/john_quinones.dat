50|$|Unlike {{most other}} newsmagazines, Downtown was never carried by any big name anchor.

The anchor/reporting duties were filled by the team of Elizabeth Vargas, Cynthia McFadden, Chris Cuomo, Jay Schadler and <b>John</b> <b>Quiñones.</b> Downtown was canceled in 2002.

50|$|The McNair Program {{is part of}} {{the federal}} TRIO programs, a group of {{educational}} opportunity programs created and governed by the Higher Education Act of 1965 and its subsequent amendments.

5000|$|<b>John</b> <b>Quiñones</b> {{was born}} in San Antonio, Texas on May 23, 1952. He is a {{fifth-generation}} San Antonian and a fifth-generation American, Quiñones {{grew up in a}} Spanish-speaking household and did not learn English until he started school at age 6. When he was 13 years old, his father was laid off from his job as a janitor and John's family, including sisters Irma and Rosemary, joined a caravan of migrant farmworkers and journeyed to Traverse City, Michigan to harvest cherries. Later that summer, the Quiñones family followed the migrant route to pick tomatoes outside of Toledo, Ohio. John will never forget the words from his father, Bruno early one morning as they knelt on the cold, hard ground of Ohio's tomato fields. [...] "Juanito, {{do you want to do}} this for the rest of your life? Or, do you want to get a college education?" [...] It was a no-brainer. Determined to overcome the current Hispanic stereotypes of being uneducated, he decided to attend college. While attending Brackenridge High School in San Antonio, Quiñones was selected to take part in the federal anti-poverty program, Upward Bound, which prepared inner-city high school students for college. [...] "Upward Bound saved my life," [...] he says. John attended St. Mary's University, in San Antonio. As an undergraduate, Quiñones was also a member of the Sigma Beta-Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha Fraternity. After graduating from St. Mary's with a bachelor's degree in Speech Communication, Quiñones earned his master's degree from Columbia University's School of Journalism.|$|E
