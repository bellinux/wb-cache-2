25|$|Venezuela also {{experienced}} shortages {{of electricity and}} was plagued by common blackouts. On 6 April 2016, President Maduro ordered public workers to not go to work believing it would cut down on energy consumption. However, the workers actually used more energy at their homes using air condition, electronics and appliances. On 20 April 2016, the government ordered the rationing of electricity in ten Venezuelan states, including {{the capital city of}} Caracas; a week after moving Venezuela's time zone ahead and telling Venezuelan women to stop using <b>hairdryers,</b> all attempts to curb electricity usage. Two days later on 22 April 2016, minister of electricity, Luis Motta Dominguez, announced that beginning the next week, forced blackouts were to occur throughout Venezuela four hours per day for the next 40 days.|$|E
500|$|References to Scottish {{culture are}} also {{reflected}} in the building and particularly {{on some of the}} building's elevations. There are a series of [...] "trigger panels", constructed out of timber or granite. Not to everyone's taste, these have been said to represent anvils, <b>hairdryers,</b> guns, question marks or even the hammer and sickle. Shortly after the official opening of the building, Enric Miralles' widow, Benedetta Tagliabue, revealed that the design is simply that of a window curtain pulled back. Her late husband however, enjoying the use of ambiguous forms with multiple meanings, had previously said he would love the profile to evoke an icon of Scottish culture, the painting of Reverend Walker skating on ice. The architectural critic Charles Jencks finds this a particularly apt metaphor for balanced movement and democratic debate and also notes the irony that Miralles too was skating on ice with his designs for the building. Elsewhere, in the public area beneath the debating chamber, the curved concrete vaults carry various stylised Saltires. Here the architect intends another metaphor; by setting the debating chamber directly above the public area, he seeks to remind MSPs whilst sitting in the chamber that their power derives from the people below them.|$|E

50|$|Non-surgical {{treatments}} of FCED {{may be used}} to treat symptoms of early disease. Medical management includes topical hypertonic saline, the use of a <b>hairdryer</b> to dehydrate the precorneal tear film, and therapeutic soft contact lenses. Hypertonic saline draws water out of the cornea through osmosis. When using a <b>hairdryer,</b> the patient is instructed to hold it at an arm's length or directed across the face on a cold setting, to dry out the epithelial blisters. This can be done {{two or three times a}} day. Definitive treatment, however, (especially with increased corneal edema) is surgical in the form of corneal transplantation. The most common types of surgery for FCED are Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK), which account for over half of corneal transplants in the United States.|$|R

50|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} examples from the genre, Hammerspace usage is not just limited to adventure games. In The Sims 2 and The Sims 3, the Sims make extensive use of Hammerspace, regularly pulling items out of their back pockets which could not possibly fit there. Examples include rakes, <b>hairdryers,</b> watering cans and bags of flour. In addition they have seemingly limitless personal inventories {{in which they can}} carry around almost anything, from a mobile phone to a sports car, without actually having anywhere to store it. These items are also occasionally pulled from the back pocket when used in game (as in the case of mobile phones). Although both games are supposed to mimic reality in many ways, they do still retain cartoon-like elements; Hammerspace was probably implemented to prevent Sims having to trek to a storage shed/closet/drawer etc. every time they wanted to use a certain item, something which would no doubt have been both boring for the player and impractical in terms of gameplay.|$|E
