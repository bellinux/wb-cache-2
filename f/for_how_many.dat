This reward could benefit the winners or it could penalize the losing side, and thus benefit the winning side. Missions can easily be modified in-game to account <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> players are humans and how many are zombies, or to make the mission easier for one side and/or harder for the opposing side. Missions can also be constructed to follow a storyline throughout the game.|$|E
25|$|There are {{no rules}} <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> species should make a genus, a family, or any other higher taxon (that is, a taxon in a {{category}} above the species level). It should be a natural group (that is, non-artificial, non-polyphyletic), as judged by a biologist, using all the information available to them. Equally ranked higher taxa in different phyla are not necessarily equivalent (e.g., it is incorrect to assume that families of insects are in some way evolutionarily comparable to families of mollusks). For animals, at least the phylum rank is usually associated with a certain body plan, which is also, however, an arbitrary criterion.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} nekomata, another cat-like yōkai which {{is said to}} derive from a cat whose tail split into two when it grew older, there are folk beliefs across Japan about how aged cats would turn into bakeneko. There are tales of cats raised for twelve years in Ibaraki Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture, and for {{thirteen}} years in Kunigami District, Okinawa Prefecture, that became bakeneko. In Yamagata District, Hiroshima Prefecture, {{it is said that}} a cat raised for seven years or longer would kill the one that raised it. There are also many regions where when people began raising a cat, they would decide in advance <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> years they would raise it because of this superstition. Also, depending on the area, there are stories in which cats that were killed by humans in a brutal manner would become bakeneko and curse that human. The stories of bakeneko are not only about aged cats, but are also sometimes stories of revenge against cruel humans.|$|E

25|$|Seven Network aired {{the first}} episode as a 90-minute special in January 1982, during the Christmas/New Year non-ratings period, and the {{official}} broadcast date of the final episode was 19 August 1987. There are 972 half-hour episodes, although during the series' original run, later episodes were shown in an hour-long format. No figures are available <b>for</b> <b>how</b> <b>many</b> of these longer episodes made up the show's run. The series was broadcast on the Seven Network, initially {{four days a week}} for half an hour at 19:00, but in later years, in two one-hour shows per week, and finally in one one-hour show per week, although this may have varied in different parts of Australia. Sons and Daughters became the highest rated programme in its slot, and was the most-watched Australian soap of the 1980s. The series eventually began to suffer from declining ratings, and was ultimately cancelled. During the 1990s the programme was repeated throughout Australia, usually in early morning and daytime slots.|$|E

2500|$|In the 20th century, wine presses {{advanced}} {{from the}} vertical style pressing {{of the basket}} press and ancient wine press to horizontal pressing with pressure either being applied at one or both ends or from the side through use of an airbag or bladder. These new presses were categorized as [...] "batch", which like the basket press {{had to have the}} pomace emptied and grapes reloaded, and as [...] "continuous" [...] where a belt or Archimedes' screw would subject the grapes/pomace to increasing pressure {{from one end of the}} press to the other with new grapes being added and the pomace being continuously removed. Another advancement was the complete enclosure of the press (sometimes called [...] "tank press") that reduced the exposure of the grape must to air. Some advance presses can even be flushed with nitrogen to create a complete anaerobic environment that can be desired for wine making with white wine grapes.
