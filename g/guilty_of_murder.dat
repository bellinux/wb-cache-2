5|$|In , (1872) the Supreme Court {{heard another}} Civil Rights Act case {{relating}} to federal courts in Kentucky.

In doing so, the Courts effectively ruled that Thirteenth Amendment did not permit a federal remedy in murder cases. Swayne and Joseph P. Bradley dissented, maintaining that in order to have meaningful effects, the Thirteenth Amendment would have to address systemic racial oppression.|$|E
