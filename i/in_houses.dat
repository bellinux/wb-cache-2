40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate selected reproductive parametres of sows stabled <b>in</b> farrowing <b>houses</b> with different technologies and losses of piglets from birth to weaning. Each variant involved 40 sows and 40 litters and the aim was to demonstrate the effect of the housing on losses of piglets. One variant (housing A) was modern while the other (housing B) was older. The total number of piglets reached <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> A was 13. 18 ± 1. 85 against 13. 03 ± 1. 91 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B. The values of live-born piglets reached 11. 50 ± 1. 36 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> A against 11. 36 ± 1. 46 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B. The number of stillborn piglets found <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> A was 1. 68 ± 1. 49 and <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B 1. 65 ± 1. 17. The differences found between the groups in the total number of piglets and the number of live-born and stillborn piglets are not statistically significant. The number of reared piglets was 10. 03 ± 1. 33 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> A versus 8. 78 ± 1. 56 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B. <b>In</b> group of sows <b>in</b> farrowing <b>house</b> A (housing A) the recorded loss of piglets in pieces was 1. 48 ± 1. 04 against 2. 60 ± 1. 63 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B. <b>In</b> percentage the loss of piglets <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> A reached 12. 56 ± 8. 50 versus 22. 29 ± 13. 46 <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> B.

5|$|Estate {{houses in}} Scotland or Scottish country houses, are large houses usually on landed estates in Scotland. They were built from the sixteenth century, after {{defensive}} castles {{began to be}} replaced by more comfortable residences for royalty, nobility and local lairds. The origins of Scottish estate houses are in aristocratic emulation of the extensive building and rebuilding of royal residences, beginning with Linlithgow, under the influence of Renaissance architecture. In the 1560s the unique Scottish style of the Scots baronial emerged, which combined features from medieval castles, tower houses, and peel towers with Renaissance plans, <b>in</b> <b>houses</b> designed primarily for residence rather than defence.|$|E
5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes <b>in</b> <b>houses</b> as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.|$|E

5|$|The banded sugar ant is {{considered}} a household pest and is occasionally seen <b>in</b> <b>houses</b> at night, capable of damaging furniture and fittings by chewing the wood; carbon disulphide is used to treat and remove a banded sugar ant nest. These ants do not pose any threat to humans, as they are incapable of stinging and can only spray formic acid, however, the larger soldiers are capable of inflicting a painful bite with their powerful jaws, and the formic acid they spray is corrosive to human skin. The eggs of this species were consumed by the Australian Aborigines.|$|E

5|$|About 30% of {{undergraduate}} men and about 40% {{of undergraduate}} women at Duke {{are members of}} fraternities and sororities. Most of the 17 Interfraternity Council recognized fraternity chapters live in sections within the residence halls. Starting in 2012, the nine Panhellenic Association sorority chapters decided to live <b>in</b> <b>houses</b> (clusters of apartments) on Central Campus. Not all sorority members live with their chapters, though, as membership exceeds house space. Eight National Pan-Hellenic Council (historically African American) fraternities and sororities also hold chapters at Duke. In addition, there are seven other fraternities and sororities that {{are a part of}} the Inter-Greek Council, the multicultural Greek umbrella organization. Duke also has Selective Living Groups, or SLGs, on campus for students seeking informal residential communities often built around themes. SLGs are residential groups similar to fraternities or sororities, except they are generally co-ed and unaffiliated with any national organizations. Fraternity chapters and SLGs frequently host social events in their residential sections, which are often open to non-members.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the houses}} at Gedi vary in size, their number of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of the houses, while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the houses. One of the oldest stone houses dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found <b>in</b> <b>houses</b> constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of houses have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the houses were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E

5|$|Early on 10 April, the Großdeutschland Division, {{consisting}} of approximately 160 tanks, including 40 Panthers and 40 Tigers, attacked westward {{along the road}} from Podu Iloaiei to Târgu Frumos in two columns deployed {{north and south of}} the road. Following a heavy bombardment, the Germans broke into the town and engaged the Soviet troops which had taken cover <b>in</b> <b>houses</b> and other buildings. The German thrust cut off a number of Soviet units from their main force and reached the high ground west of the town by launching a concerted counterattack just as the 206th Rifle, 3rd Guards Airborne and 93rd Guards Rifle Divisions were preparing to resume their assault southwards, at a time when only their rear guards and logistical subunits remained behind to defend the Târgu Frumos region. Meanwhile, the Romanian 1st Guard and 7th Infantry Division advanced from the south, pressing the Soviets back to the north. Trapped between the German armour racing into Târgu Frumos from the east and the Romanian infantry counterattacking from the south, the three divisions of 35th Guards Rifle Corps {{had no choice but to}} retreat. At about 2200 hours, 48 hours after getting their original order, the German grenadiers had secured Târgu Frumos and the regions west and north of the town.|$|E
5|$|Gerard {{also had}} an uneasy {{relationship}} with his cathedral chapter, after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them {{to give up their}} wives and concubines and become ordained priests. He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the intransigence of his clergy and envying Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular canons who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting prebends but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being celibate. The canons' argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women <b>in</b> <b>houses</b> belonging to others. It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between him and his canons; the latter accused Gerard of impoverishing York by making gifts of lands to others.|$|E
5|$|Hensley {{was arrested}} in Tennessee on moonshine-related charges during the Prohibition era and sentenced to a term in a workhouse, from which he escaped and fled the state. Hensley {{traveled}} to Ohio, where he held revival services, though {{he and his family}} rarely stayed long in one location. He established churches, known as the Church of God with Signs Following, in Tennessee and Kentucky. His services ranged from small meetings held <b>in</b> <b>houses</b> to large gatherings that drew media attention and hundreds of attendees. Although he conducted many services, he made little money, and he was arrested for violating laws against snake handling at least twice. During his ministry, Hensley claimed to have been bitten by many snakes without ill effect, and {{toward the end of his}} career, he estimated that he had survived more than 400bites. In 1955, while conducting a service in Florida, he was bitten by a snake and became violently ill. He refused to seek medical attention and died the following day. Despite his personal failings, he convinced many residents of rural Appalachia that snake handling was commanded by God, and his followers continued the practice after his death. Although snake handling developed independently in several Pentecostal ministries, Hensley is generally credited with spreading the custom in the Southeastern United States.|$|E

40|$|Equity <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> {{is a major}} {{component}} of household wealth in the United States. Steady gains <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> prices over the last several decades have generated large potential gains in household wealth among homeowners. Mankiw and Weil (1989) and McFadden (1993 b) have argued that the aging of the US population is likely to induce substantial declines <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> prices, resulting <b>in</b> capital losses for future elderly generations. However, if households can anticipate changes <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> prices, and if they adjust their non-housing savings accordingly, then welfare losses in retirement could be mitigated. This paper focuses on two questions: (1) Are housing prices forecastable from current information on demographics and housing prices?; and (2) How are household savings decisions affected by capital gains <b>in</b> <b>housing?</b> We use metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level data on housing prices and demographic trends during the 1980 's and find mixed evidence on the forecastability of housing prices. Further, we use data on five-year savings rates from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and find no evidence that households engage in changing their non-housing savings in response to expectations about capital gains <b>in</b> <b>housing.</b> Thus, the projected decline <b>in</b> <b>housing</b> prices could result in large welfare losses to current homeowners and large intergenerational equity differences. ...|$|R
