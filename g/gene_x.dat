The HBsAg gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame [...] "start" [...] (ATG) codons that divide the gene into three sections, pre-S1, pre-S2, and S. Because of the multiple start codons, polypeptides of three different sizes called large (the order from surface to the inside: pre-S1, pre-S2, and S [...] ), middle (pre-S2, S), and small (S) [...] are produced.

We previously showed that expression of the HBV <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG 2 trans-activates chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression under control of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV- 1) long terminal repeat and we have now identified a specific sequence in the HIV- 1 long terminal repeat that is responsive to the HBV <b>X</b> <b>gene.</b> Plasmid constructs with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene regulated by an isolated and twice-repeated 12 -base-pair HIV- 1 enhancer sequence homologous to the nucleotide sequence that binds the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B (the HIV- 1 kappa B-like sequence) were trans-activated by the HBV <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> in HepG 2 cells, indicating that the kappa B-like enhancer sequence in the HIV- 1 long terminal repeat is responsive to the <b>X</b> <b>gene.</b> When eight copies of the HIV- 1 kappa B-like sequence were used to regulate beta-globin gene expression, transcription of this gene was activated by the HBV <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> in HepG 2 cells and no beta-globin gene transcription was detected {{in the absence of}} the HBV <b>X</b> <b>gene.</b> beta-globin gene expression regulated by the activator protein 2 (AP- 2) binding sequence was not activated by the HBV <b>X</b> <b>gene.</b> Treatment of HepG 2 cells with phorbol ester resulted in modest activation of the HIV- 1 kappa B-like enhancer sequence suggesting that an NF-kappa B-like factor was induced in these cells as it is in T lymphocytes by phorbol ester; however, phorbol ester did not demonstrably enhance the activation of the HIV- 1 enhancer observed with the HBV <b>X</b> <b>gene.</b> These experiments indicate that the HIV- 1 kappa B-like transcriptional enhancer sequence is activated by the HBV <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> and suggest that the HBV <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> might play a role in regulating transcription of a gene under control of a kappa B-like enhancer during HBV infection.

We determined a 20 -bp promoter element for the HBV <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> transcription and found a binding protein to this promoter element, designated as an X-PBP. We then examined the effects of HBV X protein and p 53 tumor suppressor <b>gene</b> product on <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> transcription from the 20 -bp promoter element using the transient expression technique. Activity of the <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> promoter was stimulated by X protein expression, but, in contrast, was repressed by transfected normal p 53 gene. On the other hand, mutant p 53 gene product exhibited no repression. Moreover, the p 53 repression of <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> transcription was canceled by X protein coexpression. Thus, the effects of X protein and normal p 53 product appear to be mutually antagonistic in the regulation of <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> expression. However, mutated promoter elements which failed to bind to X-PBP still responded to X protein or p 53, indicating that the process of X transactivation or p 53 respression may be independent of X-PBP binding to the promoter element.

40|$|The <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> of {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) {{is one of}} the major factors in HBV-induced hepatocarcinogenesis and is essential for the establishment of productive HBV replication in vivo. Recent studies have shown that the <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> product targets mitochondria and induces calcium flux, thereby activating Ca+-dependent signal transduction pathways. However, regulatory mechanisms of <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> expression have remained unclear. Previous studies had localized a minimal promoter activity to a 21 -bp GC-rich sequence located 130 bp upstream of the X protein coding region and showed that there was a cellular protein bound to this DNA. Interestingly, the 21 -bp sequence identified as an <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> minimal promoter does not contain any previously identified core promoter elements, such as a TATA box. To better understand the mechanisms of transcriptional initiation of the <b>X</b> <b>gene,</b> we set out to biochemically purify the binding protein(s) for the 21 -bp DNA. We report here the identification of the <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> minimal promoter-binding activity as nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF 1), a previously known transcription factor that activates the majority of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes and various housekeeping genes. Primer extension analyses of the X mRNAs show that mutations at the binding site specifically inactivate transcription from this promoter and that a dominant-negative NRF 1 mutant and short interfering RNAs inhibit transcription from this promoter. Therefore, NRF 1 specifically binds the 21 -bp minimal promoter and positively contributes to transcription of the <b>X</b> <b>gene.</b> Simultaneous activation of the <b>X</b> <b>gene</b> and mitochondrial genes by NRF 1 may allow the X protein to target mitochondria most efficiently...|$|R
