Dana Alice Heller, author of Makeover television: realities remodelled (2007), said that, with [...] "Overprotected", [...] "Spears addresses the problem of being a teen star whose personal and professional are handled by others." [...] She also compared [...] "Overprotected" [...] with the singer's first reality show, [...] (2005), saying that [...] "Britney frames her makeover as a move toward to independence, a rebellion against overly controlling parents and their stand-ins." ...|$|E

I want it to be an attack, an assault on the issue because I think, {{especially}} in today's music, everything gets kind of washy sometimes and the message gets hidden in the lyrical play. Harkening back to the early '90s, when Madonna, En Vogue, Whitney Houston and TLC were making very empowering music for women and the gay community and all kind of disenfranchised communities, the lyrics and the melodies were very poignant and very gospel and very spiritual and I said, 'That's the kind of record <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make.</b> That's the record that's going to shake up the industry.' It's not about the track. It's not about the production. It's about the song. Anyone could sing 'Born This Way'. It could've been anyone." ...|$|E

Music I can dance to. I'm {{on the lookout for}} the maddest, sickest, most badass people to {{collaborate}} with. I'm just saying". One of the collaborators was French DJ and producer Martin Solveig, who was invited to a writing session by Madonna in London in July 2011. Originally, Madonna wanted to work with Solveig on one song, but eventually it turned into three tracks—"Give Me All Your Luvin", [...] "I Don't Give A", and [...] "Turn Up the Radio". In an interview with Billboard, Solveig explained that Madonna had enough time for the project, hence after working on one song, they continued recording. Solveig described the sessions as fun and labeled them a [...] "privileged time".|$|E

500|$|Speaking at a {{press conference}} after the match, Murray said, [...] "As it is, I'd be very {{surprised}} if I was playing in Paris. <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a plan as to what I do. I'll chat with the guys tonight and make a plan {{for the next few days}} then make a decision on Paris after the next five days." [...] He would go on to withdraw from Roland Garros later, citing a back injury. After a four-week break due to injury, Murray made his comeback at the 2013 Aegon Championships, where he was the top seed. After a rain delayed first day, Murray had to complete his second round match against Nicolas Mahut, and his subsequent match against Marinko Matosevic on the same day, both of which he won in straight sets. After beating Benjamin Becker in the quarterfinals, Murray next faced his first top ten opponent since losing to Tomáš Berdych in Madrid, taking on Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals. After dropping the first set against the Frenchman, Murray eventually raised his level and won in three to set up a final against Marin Čilić of Croatia, his third consecutive final on grass courts. He came from behind again to beat Čilić in three sets to claim his third title at Queen's Club.|$|E

[...] He also scored the 2013 film The Book Thief, which marked his first collaboration with a director other than Spielberg since 2005. The score earned him Academy Award, Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations and earned him a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition.
