40|$|Many resource-rich {{countries}} have negative genuine saving rates, so deplete their {{exhaustible natural resource}} wealth faster than they build up wealth in other assets. This phenomenon is stronger in more fractionalized countries with poor legal systems. We explain this by a power struggle about the control of natural resources. Competing fractions in society thus have a private stock of financial assets and a common stock of natural resources. We solve a dynamic common-pool problem and obtain political economy variants of the Hotelling rule for resource depletion and the Hartwick saving rule necessary to sustain constant consumption in an economy with <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources.</b> Resource depletion is faster than demanded by the Hotelling rule. As a result, the country has negative genuine saving rates and is running down its national wealth. The country saves more in financial assets than the current natural resource rents. Still, the erosion of natural wealth exceeds the accumulation of financial assets. Even though the power struggle boosts output, consumption is sub-optimally low.

This framework is used to show the strengths and limitations of existing answers, which motivates a new approach for dealing with this question. The paper derives simple, closed form approximations to the optimal level of government expenditure when an important part of government revenue is generated by an uncertain and <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> such as oil.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{extension}} of the classical theory of normal prices to an n-commodity economy with <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources.</b> The central idea is developed by two analytical steps. Firstly, it is assumed that a given flow of an exhaustible resource in short supply is combined with the coexistence of two methods of production using that resource. Sraffa’s equations are reinterpreted by adopting the concept of effectual supply of natural resources and avoiding the assumption of perfect foresight. Secondly, in force of the Hotelling rule, some limitations are imposed to the dynamics of normal prices and, by implication, to technical and structural change. A comparison, between such approach and the notion of intertemporal equilibrium with natural resources, introduces the central argument. The final part of the paper presents a critical assessment of recent works in this area. The conclusions are focused on methodological issues.

One of the great challenges of this century must be to understand what drives the consumption and how we can reduce consumption through increased efficiency. However {{consumption is}} not simply determined by population growth, which is commonly assumed to be a key cause of unsustainable consumption, but also by economic activity, technology choices, social values, institutions and policies. In this paper, we focus our analysis on lignite consumption in Turkey as an <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource</b> and we assume that the consumption is only the ultimate end of the economic activity. Some improvements of the Weitzman model (1976) are proposed by introducing an environmental preference parameter into the model to complement his interpretation of welfare.

40|$|AbstractThe {{permanent}} income hypothesis {{implies that}} frictionless open economies with <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> should save abroad {{most of their}} resource windfalls and, therefore, feature current account surpluses. Resource rich developing countries (RRDCs), on the other hand, face substantial development needs and tight external borrowing constraints. By relaxing these constraints and providing a key financing source for public investment, resource windfalls might then be associated with current account deficits or at least low surpluses. In this paper, we develop a neoclassical model with private and public investment and several pervasive features in RRDCs, including absorptive capacity constraints, inefficiencies in investment, borrowing constraints, and capital scarcity. We use the model to study the role of investment and these frictions in shaping the current account dynamics under windfalls. Since consumption and investment decisions are optimal, the model also serves to analyze current account norms (benchmarks). We apply the model to the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa and discuss how our results {{can be used to}} inform external sustainability analyses in RRDCs...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{argues that}} {{adjusted}} Net National Income (aNNI) rather than Gross Domestic Product (GDP) {{is the most}} appropriate measure of economic performance for a country with significant <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resources</b> and important foreign-‐investor presence. For Zambia, after properly adjusting NNI for the depletion of natural resources, we find very low (and often negative) rates of adjusted savings. The stark conclusion is that the current macroeconomic trajectory is unsustainable, as it implies shrinking national wealth. In order to reverse this trend, Zambia needs to (i) capture {{a larger share of}} the resource rents and (ii) invest that share effectively to increase the nation’s wealth. In order to accomplish this a natural resource fund coupled with an effective public investment management system has the potential to address, to a certain extent, the three main problems associated with natural resource wealth: (i) the Dutch disease (as public investment increases the productivity of private capital), (ii) volatility (as public investment becomes a buffer to absorb fluctuations in revenues), and (iii) political-‐economy issues (as a transparent, rules-‐based system prevents mismanagement of resources) ...|$|E

Using analytical tools for the depletion of an <b>exhaustible</b> <b>natural</b> <b>resource,</b> we can estimate an 'optimal control path' for land disposal in Hong Kong.

The implication is that the Hong Kong government will try to minimize wealth dissipation by adjusting its land sales policy. Given the 50 ha restriction, this can be achieved by (a) selling land lots with higher development density and (b) negotiating with the Sino-British Land Commission to relax the 50 ha limit from time to time. Both implications are consistent with empirical observations. The increase in the planned land supply when the 50 ha restrict was removed in mid- 1997 further confirms our analysis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
