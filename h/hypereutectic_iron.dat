40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{optimizing}} impact toughness and abrasion wear resistance of 15 %Cr- 2 %Mo hypereutectic abrasion-resistant white irons. The effects of dynamic solidification, niobium addition, combined action {{of them and}} heat treatment have been investigated. Investigations were performed {{by means of the}} image analyzer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray diffraction. Impact toughness and abrasion wear resistance tests were conducted. Fracture and worn surfaces were studied. Results indicated that microstructural control during solidification is the most valuable tool to attain the optimum combination between impact toughness and wear resistance in <b>hypereutectic</b> <b>iron.</b> Combined action of Nb addition and dynamic solidification improves impact toughness and wear resistance even more than the action of each individual factor. In the as-cast condition, impact toughness and abrasion resistance were increased after dynamic solidification compared to statically solidified one by 71. 4 % and 10 %, respectively. This enhancement was increased to 114. 3 % and 28. 8 % by adding 2 % Nb. Lower tempering temperature of 260 °C exhibits better impact and abrasion resistance than the sub-critical tempering temperature of 500 °C...|$|E
40|$|Recent studies {{revealed}} that in eutectic to slightly <b>hypereutectic</b> grey <b>irons</b> (CE = 4. 3 %- 4. 5 %) {{the presence of}} austenite dendrites provides an opportunity to improve the cast iron properties, as {{a high number of}} eutectic cells are “reinforced” by austenite dendrites. An iron powder addition proved to be important by promoting dendritic austenite in <b>hypereutectic</b> <b>irons,</b> but was accompanied by adverse effect on the characteristics of potential nuclei for graphite. The purpose of the present paper is to investigate the solidification pattern of these irons. Chill wedges with different cooling moduli (CM = 0. 11 – 0. 43 cm) were poured in resin bonded sand and metal moulds. Relative clear / mottled / total chill measurement criteria were applied. Iron powder additions led to a higher chill tendency, while single inoculation showed the strongest graphitizing effect. The various double treatments show an intermediate position, but the inoculant added after iron powder appears to be the most effective in reducing base iron chill tendency, for all cooling moduli and chill evaluation parameters. This performance reflects the improved properties of (Mn,X) S polygonal compounds as nucleation sites for graphite, especially in resin bonded sand mould castings. Both austenite and graphite nucleation benefit from a double addition of iron powder + inoculant, with positive effect on the final structure and chill tendency...|$|R

When casting cast iron this is useful for determining the final grain structure; for example, a <b>hypereutectic</b> cast <b>iron</b> usually has a coarse grain structure and large kish graphite flakes are formed. Also, there is less shrinkage as the CE increases. When heat treating cast iron, various CE samples are tested to empirically determine the correlation between CE and hardness.

40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} aims at {{studying the}} structural refinement of 15 %Cr- 2 %Mo hypo- and <b>hypereutectic</b> white <b>irons</b> through dynamic solidification and Nb-alloying (1 - 2 %Nb). Solidification behavior was studied using DSC. Microstructure investigation and analysis were performed using optical, image analyzer {{as well as}} SEM, EDX and XRD analysis. Refinement mechanisms proposed involved both enhancing nucleation and altering the growth process of the primary and eutectic phases either by fragmentation of the primary growing phase {{in the case of}} dynamic solidification or by consuming the available carbon from the liquid and hence the amount and size of M 7 C 3 will decrease in the case of addition of Nb-alloying. Nb has higher affinity to carbon during solidification, higher formation temperature than the main microstructure constituents and forms fine carbide so Nb achieves refinement of the microstructure...|$|R

The study was based on the analysis of several samples obtained from a highly <b>hypereutectic</b> cast <b>iron</b> melt. A <b>hypereutectic</b> melt was used in order to ensure the absence of proeutectic austenite. With the aim of obtaining samples of different graphite morphology but nearly identical chemical composition, the melt was nodularized by using a standard procedure, and different samples were cast after various fading periods. Through this procedure, spheroidal, vermicular and flake graphite samples were obtained The results show that the eutectic austenite grows dendritically in all samples investigated. Nevertheless, significant differences were found {{in the size of the}} solidification units (grains) and in the microsegregation patterns as the graphite morphology changes from spheroidal to flake...|$|R
40|$|The paper reviews {{original}} {{data obtained by}} the present authors, revealed in recent separate publications, describing specific procedures for high quality grey irons, and reflecting the forecast needs of the worldwide iron foundry industry. High power, medium frequency coreless induction furnaces are commonly used in electric melting grey iron foundries. This has resulted in low sulphur (1, 500 °C), contributing to unfavourable conditions for graphite nucleation. Thin wall castings are increasingly produced by these electric melt shops with a risk of greater eutectic undercooling during solidification. The paper focused on two groups of grey cast irons and their specific problems: carbides and graphite morphology control in lower carbon equivalent high strength irons (CE= 3. 4 %- 3. 8 %), and austenite dendrite promotion in eutectic and slightly <b>hypereutectic</b> <b>irons</b> (CE= 4. 1 %- 4. 5 %), {{in order to increase}} their strength characteristics. There are 3 stages and 3 steps involving graphite formation, iron chemistry and iron processing that appear to be important. The concept in the present paper sustains a threestage model for nucleating flake graphite [(Mn,X) S type nuclei]. There are three important groups of elements (deoxidizer, Mn/S, and inoculant) and three technological stages in electric melting of iron (superheat, pre-conditioning of base iron, final inoculation). Attention is drawn to a control factor (%Mn) x (%S) ensuring it equals to 0. 03 – 0. 06, accompanied by 0. 005 wt. %– 0. 010 wt. % Al and/or Zr content in inoculated irons. It was found that iron powder addition promotes austenite dendrite formation in eutectic and slightly eutectic, acting as reinforcement for the eutectic cells. But, there is an accompanying possible negative influence on the characteristics of the (Mn,X) S type graphite nuclei (change the morphology of nuclei from polygonal compact to irregular polygonal, and therefore promote chill tendency in treated irons). A double addition (iron powder + inoculant) appears to be an effective treatment to benefit both austenite and graphite nucleation, with positive effects on the final structure and chill tendency...|$|R

A significant increase in transition load and wear resistance upon laser treatment {{has been attributed to}} the ultrafine microstructure and high hardness; laser-melted ledeburite was superior to martensite by transformation hardening. Wear rate at a specific contact pressure and sliding speed bears a log-linear relationship with the harmonic mean of tensile and fatigue stress of ductile irons. The role of lubrication by graphite during mild wear and plastic deformation in severe wear of pearlitic ductile iron, and its enhanced resistance to plastic flow on laser melting, have been confirmed. The coefficient of friction of a ductile iron pin sliding on a steel disc before and after laser melting has been determined and compared with that of white iron of identical composition and structure obtained by conventional chilling...|$|R

40|$|The carbon {{equivalent}} of this alloy (4. 37 wt%) {{is greater than}} the eutectic composition (4. 3 wt% C) so this alloy is known as a <b>hypereutectic</b> grey cast <b>iron.</b> Si has a very low solubility in cementite and therefore its presence favours the formation of graphite in preference to cementite. Therefore, upon cooling from the liquid, the primary phase to solidify is free graphite. Graphite forms directly from the melt as flakes (black) rather than dendrites. These flakes are interconnected and align themselves in the heat flow direction. Upon further cooling the remaining liquid forms initially as a eutectic mixture of austenite and cementite, known as ledeburite. The austenite within the eutectic further transforms to a mixture of pearlite and cementite. The graphite is eventually embedded in a complex mixture known as 'transformed ledeburite'. The graphite flakes are very soft and have low density so compensate for freezing contraction upon solidification, however they also act effectively as cracks making the cast iron is brittle. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Thixoability of the ASTM A 536 {{nodular cast}} iron is analyzed, it meaning its ability to hold a {{thixotropic}} semi-solid state and to be formed as such. Thixoability can be characterized by the solidification range, fraction of primary phase and sensitiveness of liquid fraction with temperature (dfl/dT) within the solidification range. It is also investigated the effect of thixocasting in the microstructure of the considered alloy. Design/methodology/approach: Differential thermal analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and thermodynamic calculation package THERMOCALC were used to predict transformations temperatures involving liquid formation and dfl/dT within the solidification range. Microstructures of thixotropic slurries produced by partial melting were observed. Findings: Thixoforming of ASTM A 536 nodular iron can be considered in a narrow window of about 28 °C, were some dissolution of graphite nodules can still be afforded; this window meaning the range of temperatures of co-existence of austenite + graphite + liquid were the eutectic transformation is taking place. At higher temperatures the dissolution of graphite nodules in liquid can be significant. Research limitations/implications: Thixoability prediction models rely on sensitive experiments as thermoanalysis, with results strongly dependent on experimental conditions; and on thermodynamic data, sometimes not available or reliable for a specific alloy composition. Practical implications: The prediction of the thixoability of a certain alloy can make it more effective its thixoprocessing, allows better control of processing parameters and quality of final product; can also subsidize modifications in the alloy {{to make it more}} suitable to semi-solid processing. Originality/value: The study of the thixoability of a nodular <b>hypereutectic</b> cast <b>iron</b> is an original subject, not available in the specialized literature, however absolutely necessary if thixoprocessing of this family of alloys is to be considered...|$|R

Superfine dendritic (at 10 (5) degrees C s(- 1)) or feathery (at 10 (4) degrees C s(- 1)) ledeburite of 0. 2 - 0. 25 mu m lamellar space, gamma-austenite and carbide in the laser melted and martensite in the transformed zone or heat-affected zone were observed, depending on the process parameters. Depth of geometric profiles of laser transformed or melt zone structures, parameters such as dendrile arm spacing, volume fraction of carbide and surface hardness bear a direct relationship with the energy intensity P/UDb 2, (10 - 100 J mm(- 3)). There is a minimum energy intensity threshold for solid state transformation hardening (0. 2 J mm(- 3)) and similarly for the initiation of superficial melting (9 J mm(- 3)) and full melting (15 J mm(- 3)) in the case of ductile iron.

Since in this process non-uniform cooling rates are produced, the mechanical properties are expected to spatially vary due {{to the development of}} different microstructures along the thimble. The twin aims of this work were to (1) experimentally validate the GWT prediction capabilities of the microstructural model proposed earlier by the authors in the rodding process of a hypereutectic GCI-STC, and (2) estimate, from the numerically obtained microstructure and ultimate tensile strength (UTS), the local hardness of the alloy after the numerical predictions of the microstructure were experimentally validated. To this end, the final microstructure at different points of the thimble and the hardness profile along its radial direction were measured for validation purposes. Moreover, this rodding process was simulated using an extension of a thermal microstructural model previously developed by the authors and the GWT was superimposed on that simulation. The computed results encompass cooling curves, the evolution of gray and white fractions, eutectic radii and densities and, in addition, the hardness profile.

40|$|The narrow {{production}} {{window for}} compacted graphite iron material (CGI) drastically reduces {{the possibilities to}} produce it in small batches outside an industrial environment. This fact hinders laboratory-scale investigations on CGI solidiﬁcation. This work presents a solution to that issue by introducing an experimental technique to produce graphitic cast iron of the main three families. Samples of a base <b>hypereutectic</b> spheroidal graphite <b>iron</b> (SGI) were re-melted in a resistance furnace under Ar atmosphere. Varying the holding time at 1723 K (1450 °C), graphitic irons ranging from spheroidal to lamellar were produced. Characterization of the graphite morphology evolution, in terms of nodularity {{as a function of}} holding time, is presented. The nodularity decay for the SGI region suggests a linear correlation with the holding time. In the CGI region, nodularity deterioration shows a slower rate, concluding with the sudden appearance of lamellar graphite. The fading process of magnesium, showing agreement with previous researchers, is described by means of empirical relations as a function of holding time and nodularity. The results on nodularity fade and number of nodules per unit area fade suggest that both phenomena occur simultaneously during the fading process of magnesium.
