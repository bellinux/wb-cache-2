25|$|Hughes batted with an {{orthodox}} upright, side-on stance. <b>He</b> <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> bat {{high on the}} handle and played his strokes with a controlled backlift and a full follow through. He got his body well behind the ball in defence but early in his innings tended to move around the crease {{in front of his}} stumps, leaving him vulnerable to a leg before wicket dismissal.|$|E
500|$|A {{short and}} stocky left-handed batsman, Hill had a crouched, {{somewhat}} awkward stance. <b>He</b> <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> bat {{low on the}} handle, playing with a strong bottom hand. [...] His batting style was nonetheless attractive and effective and he was especially strong on the leg side and when cutting. [...] Able to score quickly when required, he was also recognised for his patience and strong defence. [...] Hill normally batted at No. 3 and, along with his contemporary Victor Trumper, he was a mainstay of the Australian batting line-up {{in the early years}} of the 20th century. [...] Hill had a strong throwing arm and was an excellent outfielder. [...] He was a popular team-mate and captain, respected for his directness, honesty and cheerfulness.|$|E
500|$|Originally a fast-medium bowler—a {{style to}} which he {{sometimes}} reverted when Surrey were short of bowlers—Fender's main bowling style was wrist spin, and he could spin the ball effectively. <b>He</b> <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> ball differently from most wrist spinners, using his thumb and first two fingers, and would attempt any kind of unorthodox delivery if he {{thought it might be}} effective. To deceive the batsman he varied [...] the position from which he bowled and the height of his arm, and occasionally bowled deliberate full tosses or long hops to surprise them. Fender hoped that, in his eagerness to score from an apparently innocuous ball, the batsman would mis-hit, a tactic he would often try when the batsman was playing defensively. Fender's love of experimentation and his surprise variations made him difficult for batsmen to face, but produced inconsistent results and he sometimes conceded many runs. His Wisden obituary suggests that Fender would have been better employed as a [...] "fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side", but Surrey's weakness in bowling meant that he had to do far more work than was ideal for his style and approach. Despite his experimentation, critics regarded him as a reliable bowler using his primary method, and The Times described him as [...] "subtle in flight and with artful variations".|$|E

5000|$|Nash's batting stance was {{described}} as [...] "peculiar". His bat touches the turf {{in line with the}} off-stump, but his feet are well clear of <b>the</b> leg stump. <b>He</b> <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> bat near the tip of the handle, and it gives an impression that the bat is inordinately long.|$|R
2500|$|In Australia he was overbowled and {{exhausted}} {{and found that}} his natural in-swingers were liked by Australian leg-side batsmen like Sid Barnes. To counter this <b>he</b> <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> ball across the seam like a spinner {{and the result was}} an in-swinging leg-break which would be known as Bedser's [...] "Special Ball". Don Bradman wrote [...] "the ball with which Alec Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test Match was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off-stump, then suddenly dipped in to pitch on the leg stump, only to turn off the pitch and hit the middle and off stumps." ...|$|E
2500|$|His stance {{was perhaps}} the most [...] "two-eyed" [...] known {{in the history of the}} game, with his right {{shoulder}} typically turned so far round as to be facing mid-off, and <b>he</b> <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> bat with the hands at the extreme ends of the handle. Such a stance would naturally lead to a defensive player who only had strokes on the leg side and would be dull and ugly. Bakewell, however, owing to his superb footwork and amazing dexterity in moving the bat, could and did easily place himself far wide of the leg stump for a ball on off stump. This allowed Bakewell to produce some of the most remarkable strokes, such as cutting sharp off-breaks pitched on middle stump and difficult hooks of short-pitched balls. Though his defence was suspect in his early days, he did work on this problem with considerable success.|$|E
2500|$|Freeman's {{common name}} comes from his {{extremely}} short stature - he was only [...] tall. However, his stocky build and strong fingers gave him great bowling stamina, and he hated being taken off. His height gave his deliveries a low trajectory that was difficult for batsmen to reach on the full toss. [...] This meant batsmen who did not play with a straight bat, or who lacked good footwork, rarely lasted long against him. [...] Freeman relied chiefly on a leg-break that pitched on middle-and-leg, so that batsmen had to play at it, and a top-spinner that was notoriously difficult to detect and brought him hundreds of wickets; the googly he used sparingly. His bowling grip was somewhat unorthodox for a leg spinner: being such a small man with small hands, <b>he</b> <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> ball between thumb, middle and index fingers rather than the orthodox leg break grip between the palm, index finger and ring finger.|$|E

2500|$|Like the batsmen the England bowlers {{were mostly}} old hands {{who had been}} playing before the war, {{unfortunately}} old bowlers rarely do well in Australia and they suffered. Bill Voce was a name well-known down under, he had been Harold Larwood's left-arm new-ball partner in the Bodyline series of 1932–33 and had taken 8/66 using the same tactics when the Australians played Notts in 1934. He was allowed on the [...] "Goodwill Tour" [...] of 1936–37 only after a public apology and took 17 wickets {{in the first two}} Tests to see England go 2–0 up in the series, but then he developed a muscle strain and Australia won the last three Tests. In 1946 he was 37 years old, the most senior England player after Hammond, but only a shadow of his former self. He failed to take a wicket in the Tests and was sidelined with a leg strain. Voce had been a spinner in his youth (until he saw Larwood bowl) and Hammond asked him to switch to slow bowling {{in the middle of the}} tour, but it was too late for him to change. Like Voce Dick Pollard was granted leave by the army to tour Australia, but was 34 years old, overweight and found that his swing bowling did not take to Australian conditions. He had taken 25 wickets (23.64) in the Victory Tests and was unlucky to not be chosen for a Test in the series, but still had some good seasons for Lancashire on his return home. The medium-fast bowling of Alec Bedser was reckoned to be the equal to that of Maurice Tate despite his poor figures, and he improved tremendously on tour. Making his debut against India at the age of 28 Bedser took 11/145 in his first Test and 11/93 in his second. In Australia he was overbowled and exhausted and found that his natural in-swingers were liked by Australian leg-side batsmen like Sid Barnes. To counter this <b>he</b> <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> ball across the seam like a spinner and the result was an in-swinging leg-break which would take 30 wickets (16.03) on his return in 1950–51. Don Bradman wrote [...] "the ball with which Alec Bedser bowled me in the Adelaide Test Match was, I think, the finest ever to take my wicket. It must have come three-quarters of the way straight on my off-stump, then suddenly dipped in to pitch on the leg stump, only to turn off the pitch and hit the middle and off stumps." [...] Bedser would take 236 wickets in Tests (a record until 1963) and was the mainstay of the England bowling attack in the decade after the war. Bill Edrich was an enthusiastic fast bowler who could generate a fair pace off a short run up, but his greatest asset was a willingness to bowl. Nevertheless, he was given the new ball in the Second Test, returned the best figures (3/79) and top-scored in both innings with 71 and 119. Norman Yardley was one of the finds of the tour, a 'bits and pieces' all rounder called on to bowl due to the failings of others he dismissed Bradman three times in a row and proved to be a valuable support bowler.|$|E
