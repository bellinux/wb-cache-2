5|$|Inflorescences are large, {{branched}} and borne {{among the}} leaves. The inflorescence {{consists of a}} main axis—the peduncle and the rachis—and a series of smaller branches, the rachillae. The rachillae, which bear the flowers, emerge from the rachis. The peduncle is the main stalk, connecting the rachis with the stem. Inflorescences either consist entirely of male flowers, or are predominantly female with a few male flowers. Fruit usually <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> seeds, although fewer or more are present in some species, and are usually brown, yellow, orange-brown or purple when mature.|$|E
5|$|With the Wizards of the Coast {{relaunch}} in 1998 the contents, under editor Kim Mohan, {{became more}} media-focused. The initial {{plan was to}} <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> stories per issue based on films, TV, and games. The 600th issue, in early 2000, included a Harlan Ellison story, {{as well as a}} story from the 100th issue, the 200th issue, and so on, up to the 500th issue. Pamela Sargent also contributed a story. The Paizo publishing relaunch, in 2004, was even more focused on media content than the Wizards of the Coast version had been, with much more movie and comics-related material than science fiction. Several well-known authors appeared in the first issue, including Harlan Ellison, Bruce Sterling, and Gene Wolfe. Paizo also ran a blog for the magazine. The fiction received positive reviews, but Paizo soon put the magazine on temporary hold, and canceled it permanently the following year.|$|E
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{ice hockey}} team may <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> goaltenders on its roster.

25|$|These {{exhibition}} matches variably <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> rounds, {{depending on}} the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.|$|E
25|$|Tigresses {{generally}} <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> litters, {{however over}} a period of seven years, from 1999 to 2006, Machali had four litters and gave birth to eleven cubs – seven females and four males. Machali's offspring increased the tiger population in the park significantly – from 15 tigers in 2004, to 50 tigers in 2014. Eventually {{more than half of the}} tigers in the park were of her lineage. In 2008, two of her female cubs were relocated to Sariska Tiger Reserve and successfully boosted the tiger population in that park as well.|$|E
25|$|The Taíno had a matrilineal {{system of}} kinship, descent and {{inheritance}}. When a male heir was not present, the inheritance or succession {{would go to}} the oldest male child of the deceased's sister. The Taíno had avunculocal post-marital residence, meaning a newly married couple lived in the household of the maternal uncle. He was more important in the lives of his niece's children than their biological father; the uncle introduced the boys to men's societies. Some Taíno practiced polygamy. Men, and sometimes women, might <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> spouses. A few caciques had as many as 30 wives.|$|E

25|$|The {{epidermis}} {{is either}} a syncytium or a single layer of cells, and is covered by a thick collagenous cuticle. The cuticle is often of complex structure, and may <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> distinct layers. Underneath the epidermis lies a layer of longitudinal muscle cells. The relatively rigid cuticle works with the muscles to create a hydroskeleton as nematodes lack circumferential muscles. Projections run from the inner surface of muscle cells towards the nerve cords; this is a unique arrangement in the animal kingdom, in which nerve cells normally extend fibres into the muscles rather than vice versa.|$|E
25|$|If {{one looks}} at the fields around the Deserted Village and right up the mountain, one can see the tracks in the fields of 'lazy beds', which is the way crops like {{potatoes}} were grown. In Achill, as in many areas of Ireland, a system called 'Rundale' was used for farming. This meant that the land around a village was rented from a landlord. This land was then shared by all the villagers to graze their cattle and sheep. Each family would then <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> small pieces of land scattered about the village, which they used to grow crops.|$|E
25|$|The {{degree of}} {{polymerization}} can be described by both the structure formed and how many tetrahedral corners (or coordinating oxygens) are shared (for aluminium and silicon in tetrahedral sites). Orthosilicates (or nesosilicates) have no linking of polyhedra, thus tetrahedra share no corners. Disilicates (or sorosilicates) have two tetrahedra sharing one oxygen atom. Inosilicates are chain silicates; single-chain silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> shared corners. In phyllosilicates, a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens; {{in the case of}} double-chain silicates, some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result. Framework silicates, or tectosilicates, have tetrahedra that share all four corners. The ring silicates, or cyclosilicates, only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure.|$|E

25|$|The Japanese macaque is diurnal. In colder areas, from autumn {{to early}} winter, macaques feed in between {{different}} activities. In the winter, macaques have {{two to four}} feeding bouts each day with fewer daily activities. In the spring and summer, they <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> bouts of feeding daily. In warmer areas such as Yakushima, daily activities are more varied. The typical day for a macaque is 20.9% inactive, 22.8% traveling, 23.5% feeding, 27.9% social grooming, 1.2% self-grooming, and 3.7% other activities. Macaques usually sleep in trees, but also sleep on the ground, {{as well as on}} or near rocks and fallen trees. During the winter, macaques huddle together for warmth in sleeping grounds. Macaques at Jigokudani Monkey Park are notable for visiting the hot springs in the winter to warm up.|$|E
25|$|Most single-breasted suits <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> buttons, {{and one or}} four buttons are unusual (except that dinner jackets ("black tie") {{often have}} only one button). It is rare to find a suit with more than four buttons, {{although}} zoot suits can {{have as many as}} six or more due to their longer length. There is also variation in the placement and style of buttons, since the button placement is critical to the overall impression of height conveyed by the jacket. The centre or top button will typically line up quite closely with the natural waistline. There seems to be no clear rule as to which side the overlap should lie. It usually crosses naturally with the left side to the fore but not invariably. Generally, a hidden button holds the underlap in place.|$|E
25|$|Since cyclists' {{legs are}} most {{efficient}} over {{a narrow range}} of pedaling speeds, or cadence, a variable gear ratio helps a cyclist to maintain an optimum pedalling speed while covering varied terrain. Some, mainly utility, bicycles use hub gears with between 3 and 14 ratios, but most use the generally more efficient dérailleur system, by which the chain is moved between different cogs called chainrings and sprockets in order to select a ratio. A dérailleur system normally has two dérailleurs, or mechs, one at the front to select the chainring and another at the back to select the sprocket. Most bikes <b>have</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> chainrings, and from 5 to 11 sprockets on the back, {{with the number of}} theoretical gears calculated by multiplying front by back. In reality, many gears overlap or require the chain to run diagonally, so the number of usable gears is fewer.|$|E
