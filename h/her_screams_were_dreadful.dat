Eve's lifeless body is loaded into an ambulance, but shortly after, her womb begins to swell rapidly - indicating her survival and impregnation by Patrick - {{while one of}} his youngest sons looks on. As the screen cuts to black, Eve's womb bursts and <b>her</b> <b>screaming</b> <b>is</b> heard.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>scream</b> <b>was</b> answered, after a pause, by {{a sudden}} volley of firebrands and sparks into {{the midst of the}} panting, {{crowding}} pack; a few smothered howls and snaps, and a sudden dispersion of the concourse. In another moment the young man, with a blazing brand in either hand, leaped upon the body of the bear.|$|R

The eagle of Romara revives in your own mountain bird, and once more is plumed for <b>her</b> flight. <b>Her</b> <b>screams</b> <b>are</b> answered by the vauntful cries of a hawk; his red comb yet reeking with slaughter. And one East, one West, those bold birds may fly, till they lock pinions in the midmost beyond.|$|R
5000|$|The Block Islanders {{insisted that}} their {{citizens}} {{had made a}} valiant effort to rescue the crew, while those on the mainland of New England suspected the islanders of luring the ship toward them {{in an effort to}} seize their cargo.

60|$|Then, asserting {{itself as}} real at once {{over all the}} sounds her mind had imagined, came a stir in the thicket, then a {{vigorous}} movement. There was a snap. The reeds crashed heavily, once, twice, thrice, and then everything was still save a measured swishing. She heard a low tremulous growl, and then everything was still again. The stillness lengthened--would it never end? She held her breath; she bit her lips to stop screaming. Then something scuttled through the undergrowth. <b>Her</b> <b>scream</b> <b>was</b> involuntary. She did not hear the answering yell from the mound.|$|R
50|$|Guests wind {{their way}} through a menacing forest. Here, trees have ugly faces and {{branches}} like talons or grasping hands. Bats fly everywhere and logs resemble snapping crocodiles.

Nearby, the Queen tries to roll a boulder down the mountain to crush the Dwarfs below.

60|$|<b>Her</b> wild <b>scream</b> <b>was</b> not a warning. It was voiced {{to freeze}} her poor victims in a {{paralysis}} of terror for the {{tiny fraction of}} an instant which would suffice for her mighty claws to sink into their soft flesh and hold them beyond hope of escape.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} side of town August Barr and Tugi, a couple of criminals, are meeting with Barr’s {{brother-in-law}} Peter Kaden.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the night, Kathy finally {{passes out}} next to Steve. The video shifts back to the next morning, where she looks at the photos with regret, but is also ecstatic to have a naked Steve passed out in her bed. The film ends with former teen idols Corey Feldman and Debbie Gibson as Kathy's parents, Kirk and Tiffany Terry, confronting Kathy {{about the state of the}} house but {{forgiving}} her after recalling their own wild youth, Feldman making several references to The Lost Boys, in which he starred.

As bodies are removed from the house, Vivia is placed on a stretcher and taken to the ambulance where Phoebe is waiting, still under the demon's control. Vivia begs not to be put in the ambulance with Phoebe, but <b>her</b> <b>screams</b> <b>are</b> ignored and the vehicle drives away.|$|R
50|$|This episode had {{an animal}} theme. Nikki was {{originally}} sent {{to work as}} a kennel maid at a dog kennel. Here she was made to clean out dog faeces from each kennel, before churning up the excrement in a blender for disposal. That part went well. She also groomed the dogs, but threw a tantrum when dog hair went up her nose, and then refused to finish her tasks. She later went {{to work as a}} zoo keeper at Bristol Zoo. Here she cleaned an Okapi pen, handled rats, and dressed as a seal in order to coax visitors to attend the seal feeding. Nikki managed to infuriate her bosses at the zoo by screaming loudly on several occasions. She was eventually prohibited from working with the animals as <b>her</b> <b>screaming</b> <b>was</b> deemed to be too upsetting for the animals, and she was removed. This episode had an overnight rating of 179,001 viewers.|$|R
50|$|Stabler locates Rook at a {{recording}} studio, and Rook shows him Benson, bound {{to a chair}} in a soundproof room, which has been wired up to explosives. Rook brings out a switch and tells Stabler that Benson is connected to an electricity generator. He gives Stabler the option of pressing the button himself or watch while he does it. Stabler refuses to hurt Benson and tries to reason with Rook, telling him too many people have suffered. Rook thanks Stabler for not being a follower, revealing {{that there are no}} explosives and Benson <b>is</b> fine, <b>her</b> <b>screams</b> <b>were</b> pre-recorded. Benson and Stabler arrest Rook. As they leave the studio, Benson explains that she left Grand Central with Rook when he admitted to having a bomb. Rook causes an explosion using a detonator tied to his ankle, and escapes. Benson and Stabler give chase, but when they cannot find him, they presume Rook jumped into the river and drowned.|$|R
50|$|Another version {{says that}} a girl has fallen off the roller coaster and <b>was</b> <b>screaming</b> to <b>her</b> death. Another version tells of a rabbit being killed outside the studio whose <b>scream</b> <b>was</b> accidentally {{picked up by the}} band's {{recording}} equipment - highly implausible, since professional recording studios are soundproof. The most widespread version of the myth, however, tells that Ester Cordet, who appeared nude on the Honey album cover, had been badly burned by the super-heated honey used for the photo shoot, which occurred simultaneous with the recording session, and <b>her</b> agonized <b>screams</b> <b>were</b> inadvertently captured on tape.|$|R
50|$|Ashok (Shammi Kapoor), {{the son of}} a rich businessman, Seth Karamchand (Nasir Hussain), telegrams {{his father}} that he is {{returning}} after several years in Europe to Bombay the following day.

50|$|House {{brings the}} {{electric}} saw and a scalpel to the scene, and {{explains that he}} cannot give her anesthesia, since it is too risky, forcing him to amputate the leg with her awake, followed by <b>her</b> <b>screams.</b> She <b>is</b> immediately taken to an ambulance, which then departs for Princeton-Plainsboro. On the ride back, House continues the differential on the crane operator through the phone and deduces {{that he has a}} spinal cyst. Hanna suddenly has trouble breathing. House realizes she has a fat embolism, caused by the amputation.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are reports}} of the London Underground being [...] Some {{of the most famous}} ghost stories include Anne Naylor, who was murdered in 1758 and is said to haunt Farringdon Station. <b>Her</b> <b>screams</b> <b>are</b> said to be heard, by passengers, as the last train leaves. Actor William Terriss, who was stabbed to death in 1897, is said to haunt Covent Garden tube station, {{although}} the last reported sighting was 1972. Tube drivers report that the Kennington Loop on the Northern line is haunted. Bethnal Green tube station is another station believed to be haunted, and the screams of women and children can be heard from the stairwell and ticket hall. It is believed that this is because of the 173 people crushed to death in the stairway during World War II. The now closed British Museum tube station was reputed to be haunted by the daughter of an Egyptian Pharaoh, Amen-Ra, which would appear and scream so loudly that the noise would carry down the tunnels to the adjourning Holborn tube station.|$|R

5000|$|A new {{string of}} homicides began the {{following}} month, including two that would remain undiscovered until Bundy confessed to them {{shortly before his}} execution. On September 2, he raped and strangled a still-unidentified hitchhiker in Idaho, then either disposed of the remains immediately in a nearby river, or returned {{the next day to}} photograph and dismember the corpse. On October 2, he seized 16-year-old Nancy Wilcox in Holladay, a suburb of Salt Lake City, and dragged her into a wooded area, intending to [...] "de-escalate" [...] his pathological urges, he claimed, by raping and then releasing her; but he strangled her—accidentally, he said—in {{the process of trying to}} silence <b>her</b> <b>screams.</b> <b>Her</b> remains <b>were</b> buried near Capitol Reef National Park, some 200 miles (320 km) south of Holladay, but were never found.|$|R
60|$|Annie had {{but given}} the {{slightest}} possible touch, with {{the point of a}} needle, to the same minute portion of complicated machinery which has been more than once mentioned, when the artist seized her by the wrist with a force that made <b>her</b> <b>scream</b> aloud. She <b>was</b> affrighted at the convulsion of intense rage and anguish that writhed across his features. The next instant he let his head sink upon his hands.|$|R

Geno and Frankie follow the body across the schoolyard {{and out into the}} forest. They then watch in horror as the body approaches the cliffs. At the last minute, she awakes and begins <b>screaming</b> for <b>her</b> mother. Her body is raised into the air and then thrown mercilessly over the edge. <b>Her</b> <b>screams</b> <b>are</b> abruptly cut off as the waves crash {{at the base of the}} cliff. Suddenly, a pale woman dressed in white with long streaming blonde hair steps out of the front door of the cottage calling Melissa's name. She calls desperately until she reaches the edge of the cliff and looks down. Upon seeing Melissa's lifeless body on the rocks below, she flings herself off the cliffs in agony. The ghostly scene ends and the shaken brothers head home. Finally, Frankie understands the source of Melissa's anguish. He vows to help her bring the killer to justice.|$|R

5000|$|Katie Cassidy also {{portrays the}} Earth-2 version of Laurel Lance {{who is a}} villain rather than a hero, known as Black Siren (a {{callback}} to the Justice Guild of America member from Justice League animated series, who herself {{was based on the}} Golden Age Black Canary). First appearing in The Flash episode [...] "Invincible", Siren is introduced as a member of Zoom's meta-human army.

He calls on Control to restore order but when the screen is illuminated {{it is not the}} handsome young Controller who speaks, but an aged and terrified old man who is dragged away by a giant claw.|$|R
60|$|Pan-at-lee slept--the troubled sleep, of {{physical}} and nervous exhaustion, filled with weird dreamings. She dreamed that she slept beneath a great tree {{in the bottom of}} the Kor-ul-gryf and that one of the fearsome beasts was creeping upon her but she could not open her eyes nor move. She tried to scream but no sound issued from her lips. She felt the thing touch her throat, her breast, her arm, and there it closed and seemed to be dragging her toward it. With a super-human effort of will she opened her eyes. In the instant she knew that she was dreaming and that quickly the hallucination of the dream would fade--it had happened to her many times before. But it persisted. In the dim light that filtered into the dark chamber she saw a form beside her, she felt hairy fingers upon her and a hairy breast against which she was being drawn. Jad-ben-Otho! this was no dream. And then she screamed and tried to fight the thing from her; but <b>her</b> <b>scream</b> <b>was</b> answered by a low growl and another hairy hand seized her by the hair of the head. The beast rose now upon its hind legs and dragged her from the cave to the moonlit recess without and at the same instant she saw the figure of what she took to be a Ho-don rise above the outer edge of the niche.|$|R

There had been many {{previous}} hints of her sexuality; she was seen visiting a burlesque house, once remarked, [...] "There goes the last lingering thread of my heterosexuality" [...] after a nude Homer ran past <b>her</b> <b>screaming</b> and she <b>was</b> seen hiding in a closet with Smithers on a parade float during a gay pride parade. In another nod to Patty's sexuality being obvious, Homer sarcastically quipped, [...] "Here's another bomb for ya, Marge: I like beer!" [...] when Marge was shocked at the revelation.|$|R
