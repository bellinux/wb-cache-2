5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of {{state income tax}} rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation in}} per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for <b>home</b> <b>consumption.</b> The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

25|$|Usually {{the deep}} purple roots of {{beetroot}} are eaten boiled, roasted or raw, and either alone or combined with any salad vegetable. A {{large proportion of}} the commercial production is processed into boiled and sterilized beets or into pickles. In Eastern Europe, beet soup, such as borscht, is a popular dish.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of literature {{points out the}} limited number of studies conducted on the relationship between local foods and restaurant choice, as well as fragmentation in terms of results. On the other hand, the growing attention consumers show for local products in a context that sees the increasing importance of out of the <b>home</b> <b>consumptions</b> (Casini et al. 2015) implies that understanding the role that the local origin of food can assume in restaurant choice is an important and topical theme, which merits investigation.|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} a semantic home automation control {{system as a}} case study. In this case study, a <b>home’s</b> energy <b>consumption</b> can be minimised by autonomously adjusting the home’s devices to attain optimal operations. Lighting control, temperature control and window control {{are some of the}} functionalities of this scenario. Though resource consumption is key in the control strategy of this system, comfort of the home’s inhabitants can not be overlooked too. Therefore, we are confronted with some level of uncertainty over minimizing the <b>home’s</b> energy <b>consumption</b> whilst maintaining the comfort of the home’s inhabitants.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{response}} of the nominal exchange rate to monetary shocks in an economy with <b>consumption</b> <b>home</b> bias (CHB). When wages are sticky monetary shocks produce exchange rate dynamics. A liquidity effect and a net foreign asset effect determine the extent of these dynamics. I demonstrate that the exchange rate dynamics generated through these two channels are greater the more consumption is biased towards locally produced goods. I also show the influence of <b>consumption</b> <b>home</b> bias is stronger (weaker) when monetary shocks result in a negative (positive) net foreign asset position. <b>Consumption</b> <b>home</b> bias Exchange rate Monetary shocks...|$|R
25|$|In 1946, the Walt Disney Company {{produced}} a film {{based on the}} Uncle Remus tales called Song of the South. While commercially successful during its original release and re-releases, the film has never been released for <b>home</b> <b>consumption</b> in the United States as, since its release, the film was criticized for the way it portrays its characters and the Southern U.S. in regard to slavery.

25|$|In 1837 Samuel Lewis {{described}} Kilrush as a seaport, {{market and}} post town. The main industries, chiefly for <b>home</b> <b>consumption,</b> were flannels, stockings and bundle cloth. The main trade was corn, butter, pigs, agricultural products and hides. There were works for refining rock salt for domestic use, a tan-yard, a soap factory and a nail factory. Branches {{of the national}} and agricultural banks had been opened in the town and a constabulary police force was also stationed there. A small prison was built in 1825 and a court house in 1831.|$|E
25|$|Filburn {{argued that}} since the excess wheat he {{produced}} was intended solely for <b>home</b> <b>consumption,</b> his wheat production could not be regulated through the Interstate Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court rejected this argument, reasoning that if Filburn had not used home-grown wheat, {{he would have had}} to buy wheat on the open market. This effect on interstate commerce, the Court reasoned, may not be substantial from the actions of Filburn alone but, through the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers just like Filburn, its effect would certainly become substantial. Therefore, Congress could regulate wholly intrastate, non-commercial activity if such activity, viewed in the aggregate, would have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, even if the individual effects are trivial.|$|E

25|$|They grow well in many farming {{conditions}} and have few natural enemies; pesticides are rarely needed. Sweet potatoes are grown {{on a variety}} of soils, but well-drained, light- and medium-textured soils with a pH range of 4.5-7.0 are more favorable for the plant. They can be grown in poor soils with little fertilizer. However, sweet potatoes are very sensitive to aluminum toxicity and will die about six weeks after planting if lime is not applied at planting in this type of soil. Because they are sown by vine cuttings rather than seeds, sweet potatoes are relatively easy to plant. Because the rapidly growing vines shade out weeds, little weeding is needed. A commonly used herbicide to rid the soil of any unwelcome plants that may interfere with growth is DCPA, also known as Dacthal. In the tropics, the crop can be maintained in the ground and harvested as needed for market or <b>home</b> <b>consumption.</b> In temperate regions, sweet potatoes are most often grown on larger farms and are harvested before first frosts.|$|E
