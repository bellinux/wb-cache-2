25|$|Dairy {{products}} are often pasteurized during production to kill pathogenic bacteria and other microbes. Butter made from pasteurized <b>fresh</b> <b>cream</b> is called sweet cream butter. Production of sweet cream butter first became {{common in the}} 19th century, {{with the development of}} refrigeration and the mechanical cream separator. Butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream is called raw cream butter. While butter made from pasteurized cream may keep for several months, raw cream butter has a shelf life of roughly ten days.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method for}} {{producing}} cultured butter, {{developed in the}} early 1970s, is to produce butter from <b>fresh</b> <b>cream</b> and then incorporate bacterial cultures and lactic acid. Using this method, the cultured butter flavor grows as the butter is aged in cold storage. For manufacturers, this method is more efficient, since aging the cream used to make butter takes significantly more space than simply storing the finished butter product. A method to make an artificial simulation of cultured butter is to add lactic acid and flavor compounds directly to the fresh-cream butter; while this more efficient process is claimed to simulate the taste of cultured butter, the product produced is not cultured but is instead flavored.|$|E

[...] Ertegun previewed the demos and was unhappy, expecting more blues-based material that was found on <b>Fresh</b> <b>Cream.</b> [...] Jerry Wexler, Ertegun's Atlantic Records partner, reportedly {{went as far as}} to call it [...] "psychedelic hogwash". [...] However, Booker T.

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} bands in forging the merger of psychedelic rock and acid rock with the blues rock genre was the British power trio Cream, who derived a massive, heavy sound from unison riffing between guitarist Eric Clapton and bassist Jack Bruce, as well as Ginger Baker's double bass drumming. Their first two LPs, <b>Fresh</b> <b>Cream</b> (1966) and Disraeli Gears (1967), are regarded as essential prototypes for the future style of heavy metal. The Jimi Hendrix Experience's debut album, Are You Experienced (1967), was also highly influential. Hendrix's virtuosic technique would be emulated by many metal guitarists and the album's most successful single, [...] "Purple Haze", is identified by some as the first heavy metal hit. Vanilla Fudge, whose first album also came out in 1967, has been called [...] "one of the few American links between psychedelia and what soon became heavy metal", and the band has been cited as an early American heavy metal group. On their self-titled debut album, Vanilla Fudge created [...] "loud, heavy, slowed-down arrangements" [...] of contemporary hit songs, blowing these songs up to [...] "epic proportions" [...] and [...] "bathing them in a trippy, distorted haze." ...|$|E

Clapton used the guitar for most of Cream's recordings after <b>Fresh</b> <b>Cream,</b> particularly on Disraeli Gears, until the band broke up in 1968. After Clapton it passed to Jackie Lomax, who may have acquired it from George Harrison. It then passed to Todd Rundgren, who had seen Clapton play it during Cream's show at the RKO Theater and was [...] "mesmerized" [...] by it. Rundgren reportedly paid $500 for the guitar and had various repairs done to it. He had the guitar finished anew and retouched in places, and {{a portion of the}} neck and headstock was replaced. Rundgren sold the guitar in 2000 at auction for around $150,000 to pay off a tax debt, donating 10% to Clapton's Crossroads Centre.
