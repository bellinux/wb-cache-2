40|$|The {{temperature}} and moisture regimes {{in a forest}} are key components in the forest ecosystem dynamics. Observations and studies indicate that the internal temperature distribution and moisture content of the tree influence not only growth and development, but onset and cessation of cambial activity [1], resistance to insect predation[2], and even affect the population dynamics of the insects [3]. Moreover, temperature directly affects the uptake and metabolism of population from the soil into the tree tissue [4]. Additional studies show that soil and atmospheric temperatures are significant parameters that limit the growth of trees and impose treeline <b>elevation</b> <b>limitation</b> [5]. Directional thermal infrared radiance effects have long been observed in natural backgrounds [6]. In earlier work, we illustrated the use of physically-based models to simulate directional effects in thermal imaging [7 - 8]. In this paper, we illustrated the use of physically-based models to simulate directional effects in thermal, and net radiation in a adeciduous forest using our recently developed three-dimensional, macro-scale computational tool that simulates the heat and mass transfer interaction in a soil-root-stem systems (SRSS). The SRSS model includes the coupling of existing heat and mass transport tools to stimulate the diurnal internal and external temperatures, internal fluid flow and moisture distribution, and heat flow in the system...|$|E

The method employs the same concepts as the implicit solutions used for finite-difference formulations posed in a recursive manner. The displacements required across the free surface boundary are then found by a deterministic method where structure is locally flat, and by an implicit method where {{the structure is}} sloped, proceeding from low to higher <b>elevations.</b> The <b>limitations</b> to this technique are shown, and a practical example is given...|$|R

40|$|A case of {{periarteritis nodosa}} with {{bilateral}} diaphragm elevation and acute respiratory failure is reported. A 43 -year male visited our hospital because of dyspnea on exertion. The chest plain film has shown bilateral diaphragm <b>elevation</b> and its <b>limitation</b> in motor activity during last one year. Two months after admission, fever of unknown origin occurred suddenly, with muscle weakness, acute respiratory failure, and augmented dyspnea exertion. The patient was cared in Intensive Respiratory Care Unit with oral administration of steroid therapy (60 mg/day). One {{day after the}} administration, all symptomes were mitigated. Biopsy of the biceps brachii revealed perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes and type IIb atrophy.

40|$|Traditionally {{the design}} of grade lines of {{highways}} is allocated to senior civil engineers because of the inherent complexity and the compromises that must be made. At one hand multiple, and often contradictory constraints must be simultaneously met {{and on the other}} hand the design must be optimized for safety and cost. While the experience of a senior engineer is indispensable for the political and social aspects of the highway, a good first approximation is feasible with todays computers. In this work {{the design of}} grade line is approached with simulated annealing, which is a stochastic optimization method suitable for multi-optimization problems of large scale, especially ones where the desired global extremum is hidden among many, poorer, local extrema. It is insensitive to initial approximation and can easily take into account diverse constraints. The entities to be optimized are cut-fill for cost, and grade line geometry for safety. The constraints are obligatory horizontal points, obligatory <b>elevations,</b> and <b>limitations</b> of slope and vertical curves. The value of the entities is translated to penalties or energy, with suitable functions. Analogous functions translate constraints satisfactions to penalties or energy. The relative energy of the entities and constraints must be chosen carefully and may vary due to local conditions such as terrain. The energy is minimized by making random and appropriate changes, such as the introduction of a new node, to an original system configuration. Gradually the changes are becoming less and less agile, through the decrease of a control parameter which simulates the temperature, and converge to the optimum solution. Tests with real world data are presented and show very good results. 2. Keywords: optimization, highway design, simulated annealing 3...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{operations}} {{dependent on}} digitized {{terrain elevation data}} for navigational reference or trajectory generation are constrained in minimum flight altitude, due to airborne navigation errors and inaccuracies of the reference terrain <b>elevation</b> data. This <b>limitation</b> is not restrictive in traditional medium-altitude implementations of such databases, such as in unmanned aerial vehicles, missiles, or high-performance, high-speed aircraft. In low-altitude, lower speed terrain hugging helicopter missions, however, such constraints on minimum flight altitudes greatly reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} missions and diminish the benefits of employing terrain elevation maps. A Kalman filter state estimator has been developed which blends airborne navigation, stored terrain elevation data, and a radar altimeter in estimating above-ground-level (AGL) altitude. This AGL state estimator was integrated in a near-terrain guidance system aboard a research helicopter and flight tested in moderately rugged terrain over a variety of flight and system conditions. The minimum operating altidude of the terrain database referenced guidance system was reduced from 300 ft to 150 ft with the addition of the Kalman filter state estimator...|$|R
40|$|Sandy and gravely shores {{and banks}} that appear during {{low-flow}} periods of great rivers are {{a type of}} marginal habitat that has become rare during the last century. Plants that establish here are submitted {{to a series of}} highly growth-constraining conditions: (i) an only short inundation-free period, (ii) scouring water flow the rest of the year, (iii) frequent disturbances during the low-water period by fluctuating water levels if they are situated on low <b>elevations,</b> or nutrient <b>limitation,</b> drought and thermal stress on higher elevations. The present study presents the results of a small-scale monitoring of vegetation during the summer low-water period on the middle reaches of the Loire River (France). This vegetation hosts endangered plant species as well as exotic ones. Survivorship, growth, and phenology of reproduction were monitored throughout low-water season. A total of about 1000 individual plants on three levels of elevation were observed. The results are analysed in terms of plant strategies and confronted with the stress/disturbance profiles of the habitats. The aim of the study is to single out the most efficient strategies per type of stress/disturbance profile. This will allow predicting vegetation dynamics, especially the dynamics of endangered and exotic species...|$|R
40|$|QUESTIONS : The {{richness}} of invasive alien plant species tends to {{decrease with increasing}} elevation. This pattern {{may be due to}} alien plant species requiring traits allowing survival at high <b>elevations</b> (the Abiotic <b>Limitation</b> Hypothesis; ALH). In contrast, the more recent Directional Ecological Filtering Hypothesis (DEFH) suggests that only species with broad environmental tolerances will successfully spread from lowlands (where most introductions occur) to high elevations. Here we test the support for the DEFH and the ALH along an elevational gradient by asking: First, are alien species that occur at higher elevations generalists? Second, do alien species occurring at higher elevations exhibit traits that distinguishes them from lowland alien species? LOCATION : Sani Pass, Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation Area, South Africa. METHODS : A nestedness analysis was conducted to test whether alien species were nested along the elevational gradient, and ANOVA and Chi 2 tests (supplemented by resampling procedures) were used to determine if functional traits differed between high and low elevation alien species. RESULTS : Significant nestedness of the alien flora indicates that alien species occurring at high elevations are generalists, being widespread across the elevational gradient. Compared to low elevation aliens, plant height was lower and cold tolerance weaker for high elevation species. CONCLUSION : We found support for the DEFH with the majority of high elevation aliens being widespread generalists. Overall only two of the 11 functional traits differed between high and low elevation alien species, with only one trait supporting the ALH: shorter plant stature found at higher elevations. Therefore, complementing nestedness analyses with trait data provides a more nuanced insight into the determinants of alien richness patterns along elevational gradients and highlights how the two contemporary hypotheses might not be mutually exclusive.

40|$|Distributional and {{ecological}} dynamics of Neotropical migratory birds at stopover sites where they maintain critical fat reserves during migration remain poorly understood in North American aridlands. I examined spatiotemporal abundance {{and timing of}} migrants relative to 1) upland and riparian habitats, 2) post-fire landscape mosaics, and 3) phenological synchrony and overlap of migration with tree flowering in southeastern Arizona's Madrean Archipelago (2009 - 2011), and 4) abundance, habitat breadth, and foraging substrates relative to tree flowering along the Colorado River in southwestern Arizona and northwestern Sonora, Mexico (2000 - 2003). I explored these dynamics relative to local weather conditions and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) climate phenomena. In Madrean habitats, migrants showed three non-exclusive responses to high precipitation, snowfall, and low minimum temperatures associated with El Niño in 2010; migration timing adjustments, habitat shifts, and reduced abundances suggesting migration route shifts. Foliage-gleaning insectivores were most abundant in high severity burns, disproportionate to their availability, and decreased with time since fire (TSF); flycatchers were most abundant in low-moderate severity and increased with TSF. Migrant abundance increased with tree flowering. Phenological overlap declined with increasing difference in timing of these events. Overlap was lowest in 2011 in riparian habitat due to low willow (Salix goodinggii) flowering, despite high migrant abundance, but lowest in 2010 in montane conifer, despite high pollen cone production by Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga meziesii), suggesting temperature limitation of insect abundance at high <b>elevations,</b> but water <b>limitation</b> of plant phenology at lower elevations. Along the Colorado River, migrant abundance and habitat breadth had inverse positive and negative quadratic relationships, respectively. Abundance increased with tree flowering, but only in 2003 during severe drought. Habitat breadth increased with monsoon precipitation. Foraging substrate use tracked flowering, shifting from willow to mesquite (Prosopis sp.); the overlap coincided with peak abundance and narrowest habitat breadth. Maintenance of diverse vegetation and post-fire landscape mosaics in the Madrean Archipelago should benefit migratory bird diversity. Flowering phenology likely provides large-scale cues of local-scale stopover habitat condition associated with interannual climatic variation. Management and restoration of upland habitats and large riparian woody perennials will be critical for migratory bird conservation in aridlands...|$|R
40|$|Understanding species {{distributions}} {{and patterns}} in plant diversity {{is a central}} goal in ecology. Two contrasting concepts occur in this field, explaining species distributions by species requirements and tolerances to environmental conditions (known as ‘environmental filtering’), or by patterns in the arrival of seeds and viable plant fragments (known as ‘dispersal filtering’). Quantitative information on their relative importance, {{as well as on}} the different mechanisms underlying the filtering processes is however generally lacking, but critical for ecosystem conservation and restoration. For vegetation of streams and their riparian zones it is particularly unclear which of the filtering processes dominates. These ecosystems have been heavily degraded worldwide due to human interventions like damming and channelization, and often show only marginal ecological improvement after restoration. More innovative restoration measures, in which construction of narrower and shallower channels was combined with a meandering watercourse and wider stream valleys, seem more promising for ecological success. This thesis aimed at identifying the most important drivers of plant species distribution and diversity patterns along lowland streams and their riparian zones, and assessing ecological responses to innovative restoration. Natural seed arrival patterns along the riparian gradients of restored stream reaches were monitored with seed traps (dispersal filtering). This was combined with field experiments on recruitment of introduced seeds and seedlings along these gradients (environmental filtering), to subsequently compare the influence of both processes on adult distribution patterns in the naturally developing vegetation. Additionally, the aquatic and riparian vegetation at restored reaches was compared to unrestored (still channelized) reaches. Deposited seed numbers and species richness were significantly higher in flooded seed traps than in non-flooded seed traps, demonstrating the importance of restored flooding regimes for riparian plant colonization. Experimental introduction of seeds and seedlings showed that the hydrological gradient acted as a strong environmental filter on germination, seedling survival and seedling growth, through imposing stress (by inundation) at low <b>elevations</b> and resource <b>limitation</b> (water shortage) at higher elevations. This induced a wet-dry gradient in the vegetation, reflecting the preferred habitat conditions as adult plants. Strikingly, patterns in seed arrival foreshadowed this gradient; seeds of species with adult optima at wetter conditions dominated seed arrival at low elevations while seeds of species with drier optima arrived higher up. These results demonstrated that environmental filtering during early recruitment stages, but also non-random dispersal, are important drivers of early successional riparian vegetation zonation and biodiversity patterns. The innovative restoration promoted a higher diversity of riparian plant species, particularly at the channel margins and the land-water interface. The higher flow velocities at the restored reaches resulted in a shift to more typically lotic (running water) in-stream plant communities, indicated by less floating-leaved species and more species with growth forms trailing on the water surface. Widening of the floodplain enlarged hydrological wetland niches resulting in a higher species diversity of typical wetland plants. For future stream restoration projects, combinations of reduced channel dimensions, restored meandering of the watercourse, and a widened but gradually sloping stream valley were shown to be essential...|$|R
