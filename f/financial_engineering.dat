25|$|Leveraged {{exchange-traded}} funds (LETFs or leveraged ETFs) are {{a type of}} ETF {{that attempt}} to achieve returns that are more sensitive to market movements than non-leveraged ETFs. Leveraged index ETFs are often marketed as bull or bear funds. A leveraged bull ETF fund might for example attempt to achieve daily returns that are 2x or 3x more pronounced than the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S 500. A leveraged inverse (bear) ETF fund {{on the other hand}} may attempt to achieve returns that are -2x or -3x the daily index return, meaning that it will gain double or triple the loss of the market. Leveraged ETFs require the use of <b>financial</b> <b>engineering</b> techniques, including the use of equity swaps, derivatives and rebalancing, and re-indexing to achieve the desired return. The most common way to construct leveraged ETFs is by trading futures contracts.|$|E

2500|$|Financial risk management, {{an element}} of {{corporate}} finance, is the practice of creating and protecting economic value in a firm by using financial instruments to manage exposure to risk, particularly credit risk and market risk.
