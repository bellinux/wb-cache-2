25|$|In 1988, {{the diesel}} engine was {{enlarged}} to 1.8L, whilst the entry level 1.1L and 1.3L models were updated with the redesigned HCS {{version of the}} Kent/Valencia family introduced for the Mk III Fiesta. For the same year, a Ford developed electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> replaced the Bosch K-Jetronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> in the XR3i and Orion Ghia injection models, and a central point <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> replaced the carburettor on models with the 1.4L engine.|$|E
25|$|Yugo 45 {{derivative}} {{models have}} included the Yugo 55, 60, 65, Koral, Ciao, Tempo, Cabrio, GV, GV Plus, GVX, and GVL. Yugo engines were fitted with a carburetor {{until well into the}} 1980s before fuel-injected models (starting with the Koral 65) were introduced beginning with the GVX-EFI (an electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system),</b> which featured a 1300 cc engine.|$|E

50|$|SPICA S.p.A. (Società Pompe Iniezione Cassani & Affini) was an Italian {{manufacturer}} of <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R
50|$|Open-loop <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> {{had already}} {{improved}} cylinder-to-cylinder fuel distribution and engine operation {{over a wide}} temperature range, but did not offer further scope to sufficient control fuel/air mixtures, {{in order to further}} reduce exhaust emissions. Later closed-loop <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems</b> improved the air-fuel mixture control with an exhaust gas oxygen sensor. Although not part of the injection control, a catalytic converter further reduces exhaust emissions.|$|R
25|$|The X180 cars {{inherited}} most {{of their}} mechanical components from the earlier HC Esprit and Turbo Esprit, although the name for the forced induction model was now Esprit Turbo. 1988 model year North American Esprit Turbos kept the Citroën transaxle and Bosch <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> used in the previous model year. Other X180s received a new Renault UN-1 transaxle, which necessitated a move to outboard rear brakes.|$|E
25|$|The opening laps saw cars {{slide off}} the circuit, {{but he would}} never get the choice to join the chaos, as his <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> failed on the very first lap. In fact the entire Japanese {{contingent}} suffered a dreadful race, especially when both Katayama and rookie Taki Inoue then aquaplaned into the pit wall {{at the end of}} lap three in separate incidents. Within the first few minutes all the local heroes were out of the race.|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of the 200, which was equipped with a Stromberg or Pierburg carburetor but was not available to the United States, fuel injection was standard, and the engines incorporated features that maximised performance. The most notable such feature was the addition of an oxygen sensor in the exhaust system which, in conjunction with a semi-electronic <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> could make the engine run more efficiently. This improved fuel consumption while simultaneously meeting stricter emission regulations. Mercedes-Benz's four-wheel drive system, the 4Matic was first introduced on the W124 in 1987.|$|E
50|$|Carburetors in {{most cases}} were {{replaced}} by <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>systems,</b> also provided by Bendix, during the 1970s.|$|R

25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (diverter or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow off valve). Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system,</b> because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|The SD70ACe-T4 is the Tier 4 {{emissions}} standards-compliant {{version of}} the SD70ACe. The first locomotive was built in summer 2015, and made its debut at the Railway Interchange Expo in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the weekend of October 3–4, 2015. It features a new 4-stroke engine called the EMD 12-1010 - a V12 with 1010 cu.in displacement for each cylinder. This new prime mover has a two-stage turbocharger system consisting of three turbos; one turbo (the primary/high pressure turbo) for low-mid RPM and two turbos (the secondary/low pressure turbos) for mid-high RPM. The results of this setup are bigger power throughout the broader RPM range, better fuel efficiency, and lower emission. An EGR system is applied as well, allowing the engine to achieve Tier 4 {{without the use of}} urea after treatment. Another new feature of this engine is the Double-Walled <b>Fuel</b> <b>Injection</b> <b>System</b> that increases safety and provides simplified maintenance works.|$|E
25|$|Despite the car's {{problems}} in the latter two races, Zakspeed and Ford continued with the Mustang GTP program in 1984; the 2.1-litre engine was finally ready, and was used throughout the season. Ludwig was selected to drive the solitary entry at the Grand Prix of Miami, which was {{the second round of}} the IMSA GT Championship; a puncture damaged the front left suspension on his car, and forced him to retire after 31 laps, resulting in Ludwig being classified 25th. The team skipped the 12 Hours of Sebring, and next entered Ludwig and Rahal at the Grand Prix of Atlanta; this time, the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> packed up after 47 laps, restricting them to 48th overall, and 18th in the GTP category. The Los Angeles Times Grand Prix was little better; Rahal and Ludwig completed 74 laps before a valve in the engine broke, and forced them out of the race, resulting in a classification of 40th overall, and 20th in the GTP category. Two cars were entered at the Monterey Triple Crown; Ludwig drove one, while Bob Wollek drove the other. However, Ludwig retired on lap 45, and Wollek lasted an extra lap. The Grand Prix of Charlotte was even less successful; Ludwig crashed in practice and could not race, while Wollek retired after 21 laps, and finished 43rd overall, and 16th in class; however, he had also set the fastest lap of the race.|$|E

500|$|Audi had not {{originally}} planned {{to participate in}} the African marathon events, but now found it necessary to enter the penultimate round, the Rallye Côte d'Ivoire, due to their title battles with Opel. Just {{before the start of the}} event, Mouton received news that her father had succumbed to cancer in his house in Nice. His last wish was that Mouton start the rally. After a first day of over 1,200 kilometres (750 miles) of racing in temperatures over 30°C (86°F), she was eight minutes clear of Mikkola and nearly half an hour ahead of title rival Röhrl. Mikkola said that he had never been in such a hot car, and Röhrl estimated that the temperature inside his car reached an [...] "almost unbearable" [...] 70°C. With just over half of the 5,000km (3,100mi) behind, Mouton led from Röhrl by over an hour despite losing 25 minutes due to transmission problems. On the third day, both Mouton and Röhrl struggled with several reliability issues and her lead over Röhrl shrank to 18 minutes. The Toyota Celica GT2000s of Eklund and Waldegård were still over two hours behind. Should Mouton go on to hold off Röhrl, she would reduce Röhrl's lead in the championship to just two points. As a driver's seven best results counted towards the championship at the time, Mouton would only need a third place in the RAC Rally to take the title even if Röhrl would win. On the final day, she continued to suffer from mechanical problems and had the complete <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>system</b> changed. For the next time control, Röhrl and Mouton arrived almost simultaneously. With only 600km to go, Mouton went off the road and rolled her car. She drove the severely damaged Quattro for five more kilometres before giving up.|$|E
