It may have a hexagonal section in the center for wrench to grasp (sometimes {{referred to as a}} [...] "hex nipple"), or it may simply be made from a short piece of pipe (sometimes referred to as a [...] "barrel nipple" [...] or [...] "pipe nipple"). A [...] "close nipple" [...] has no unthreaded area; when screwed tightly between two <b>female</b> <b>fittings,</b> very little of the nipple remains exposed. A close nipple can only be unscrewed by gripping one threaded end with a pipe wrench which will damage the threads and necessitate replacing the nipple, or by using a specialty tool known as a nipple wrench (or known as an internal pipe wrench) which grips the inside of the pipe, leaving the threads undamaged. When the ends are of two different sizes it is called a reducer or unequal nipple.|$|E
50|$|Most lens {{adapters}} {{feature a}} male <b>fitting</b> and a <b>female</b> <b>fitting.</b> The male fitting {{attaches to the}} camera, and the <b>female</b> <b>fitting</b> attaches to the lens. There is also {{an opening in the}} center to allow the light to pass through. Lens adapters can be shorter or longer, based on the respective flange focal distance of the lens and camera being adapted. Flange focal distance is the key specification in determining whether or not a particular type of lens can be adapted to any given camera. Generally speaking, cameras with a shorter flange focal distance can be adapted to a greater diversity of lenses. This is because there must be enough room to fit an adapter between the lens and the camera.|$|R

I studied the pre-existing knowledge of gun laws and statistics within the United States using college students at Fort Lewis College. I did this through a short questionnaire asking about their experience with guns, knowledge regarding laws and statistics, and their opinions of these laws and statistics. I had 19 females and 17 males (36 total) participate in my study. I found that males actually knew more about guns than females did, politically affiliated people (Democrats or Republicans) believe in background checks more so than non-politically affiliated people, religion has no correlation with views about guns, and people with more gun experience are more likely to believe that households would be safer with more guns. It was not surprising that people with more gun experience believe households would be safer with guns in the home nor that politically affiliated people believe in more background checks. It was unexpected that, when it came to knowledge about guns, males knew more than <b>females,</b> <b>fitting</b> the stereotype, although religion did not fit into the stereotype of more conservative attitudes.

This study, then, will demonstrate how certain patriarchal ideas associated with fairy tales are disseminated when fairy tale elements are reworked in film, visual art and the novel. The aim of this project, more specifically, is to show how certain stereotypical representations of women endure in works that could be read as feminist appropriations of Hans Christian Andersen’s ‘The Little Mermaid’. Stereotypical representations of women are numerous and may include: depicting <b>females</b> as <b>fitting</b> neatly into what is often called the virgin/whore or Madonna/whore binary opposition; depicting women as being caring and kind, but also passive, submissive and weak; and depicting older women as being sexually unattractive and evil (Goodwin and Fiske 2001 : 358; Sullivan 2010 : 4).

40|$|Human skeletons {{are among}} the most {{important}} data in archaeological records; it is important to study these data in order to extract biological and cultural information. One of the most widely used statistical methods for analyzing such data is the survival analysis. In this paper, we try to compare the two models of survival analysis for estimating age at death in presence of covariates in an ancient site. This is a retrospective cohort study based on the findings from twelve seasons of excavation at the site of Shahr-i-Sokhta in southeastern Iran, from 1997 to 2008. Out of the 758 discovered skeletons, 349 were complete and measurable, which were selected based on an estimated age of over 12 years {{at the time of their}} death. For the analytical purposes we used a Two-parameter Weibull regression model as well as a generalized Weibull regression model, both with Bayesian approaches for estimating their relevant parameters. Out of 349 study subjects 206 (59 %) were <b>female.</b> The <b>fitting</b> results of both models showed a significant relationship that could be between age at death and the number of buried objects along with skeletons. In other words, for individuals who were associated with more than five objects, the risk of death might have been lower. The other exploratory variables including sex, the presence of sacrifices, and the existence of prestigious goods did not show any significant relationship. The fitting results of these two models on the basis of the data showed that the estimates of the generalized Bayesian model had smaller standard deviations than the corresponding ones from two-parameter Weibul model. The model's adequacy index “Deviance Information Criterion” (DIC) in the generalized Bayesian Weibull model was also smaller than that of the other model. As a result, in this case study, the generalized Bayesian Weibull model was found as more efficient. Key-Words: Excavated Skeleton, Shahr-i-Sokhta, Weibull Model, Bayesian Approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the heritability, stability, and {{outcomes}} of antisocial behavior from adolescence into adulthood in a longitudinal twin sample. Specifically, the genetic and environmental influences on conduct disorder, adult antisocial behavior, and alcohol dependence were examined. The influence of genes and environment on the relationship between these disorders was also examined. The study utilized a subset of FinnTwin 12, a population-based twin study that consists of five consecutive birth cohorts. The subsample consisted of 1035 twin pairs (N = 2070) and of that 2070, 1854 completed the intensive interview at age 14. At age 22, 1345 twins completed the interview. Participants in the study completed age-appropriate variations of the Semi-Structured Assessment for the Genetics of Alcoholism (SSAGA). Analyses were run separately by gender. Results provide support for the significant influence of genetic factors on the development and persistence of antisocial behavior. For both males and <b>females,</b> model <b>fitting</b> indicated that genetic influences are the most influential contributor to the association between conduct disorder and adult antisocial behavior and its stability across time. Additionally, there were no age specific genetic effects suggesting that the genes influencing conduct disorder are the same as those influencing adult antisocial behavior. Results for the relationship between conduct disorder and alcohol dependence differed by gender. For females, insufficient power made it difficult for the model to discriminate between the effects of genetics and shared environment, but the full model suggested that shared environmental influences explained the greatest proportion of variance in the relationship. For males, genetic influences were primarily responsible for the relationship between conduct disorder and alcohol dependence. Similar results were found for males when the relationship between alcohol dependence and adult antisocial behavior was explored. For females, genetic and nonshared environmental influences were the primary source of covariation between these two disorders. The data suggest that the etiology of conduct disorder, adult antisocial behavior, and alcohol dependence vary by gender...|$|R

Methods: For 3 wks, female (smokers, n= 5 non-smokers, n= 5) and male (smokers, n= 5; non-smokers, n= 5) subjects subsisted on a beef-based diet. Beginning the 3 rd wk, subjects received a dose of d 5 - 18 : 3 n- 3 ethyl ester (1 g).

The breeding season occurred during the falling and low-water periods, which is hypothesized to be an adaptation to maximize the chances of young stages to reach the estuary. The size at first sexual maturity was slightly larger for females than males, c. 91 and 83 cm standard length (L-S), respectively. Both males and females reproduce {{for the first time}} at > 3 years old. The fecundity per spawning event ranged from 481 734 to 1 045 284 oocytes for females weighing 25 and 34 kg, respectively. Seasonal variations of body condition were similar among sexes, but differed between immature specimens that had a higher condition during the low-water period and lower condition during rising waters, and mature individuals that showed the opposite pattern. The growth characteristics were estimated by L-S frequency analysis. For <b>females,</b> the best <b>fitting</b> models gave a mean birth date in August, during the height of the breeding cycle, with the following von Bertalanffy growth function parameters: L-S infinity = 153. 3, K = 0. 29 and t(0) = - 0. 37 years. For males, the best fitting model gave a mean birth date in July, also during the height of the breeding period, with L-S infinity = 142, K = 0. 30 and t(0) = - 0. 36 years. At a given age, females were systematically larger than males and the size difference increased with age. The largest females sampled (148 cm L-S) was 11 years old and the largest male (134 cm L-S) was 9 years old. The mortality estimates were higher for males total (Z) = 1. 34, natural (M) = 0. 52 and fishing (F) = 0. 82 than for females (Z = 0. 98, M = 0. 50, F = 0. 48).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{and analyses}} from an anatomical and anthropometric perspective, two pattern engineering systems currently {{used by the}} clothing industry {{for the production of}} female garments. To the best of the researcher‘s knowledge no similar study has been previously conducted in Australia. The research is significant in that pattern engineering systems provide the basis from which all garments are produced. Biological changes in human female morphology over the past century have impacted significantly on the clothing industry‘s ability to provide garments that meet an acceptable fit standard. Rising concerns regarding the increase in overweight and obesity provide an even greater challenge for the production of well <b>fitting</b> <b>female</b> garments. Many pattern engineering systems rely on a long standing assumption of proportionality based on a fixed relationship between specific body dimensions, such as height and breadth, to calculate other body dimensions. These systems overlook relative changes in body dimensions that have occurred and are continuing to occur at the present time. In contrast, the use of direct measurements requires no assumptions regarding body shape and accommodates all body types with equal proficiency. This study compared two such systems, testing the fit of dress toiles made in compliance with the specifications of both types of systems, and fitted on a group of adult females, each of whom conformed to one of 5 body types anthropometrically identified in the Australian population by the author in earlier research. The dress toiles constructed according to direct measurement principles were significantly superior in fit to those constructed according to calculated proportional principles. They were also the preferred choice of 100 % of subjects when rated for comfort and ease of movement. The following conclusions were made: (i) that the assumptions concerning body size and proportions underlying calculated proportional pattern drafting systems are questionable, particularly in view of the accelerating secular trend of obesity, and (ii) that direct measurement pattern cutting systems which focus on and use current body shape data are better able to accommodate unpredictable and unspecified variations in {{the size and shape of}} the human female body. The lack of standardisation of body measurement techniques was discussed with particular emphasis on the bust circumference which is fundamental in calculated proportional systems. Note was also made of the divergence away from technical skills and expertise in anthropometry which may be a result of the restricted curriculum currently offered by training institutions in Australia and elsewhere. There was strong agreement between the results and conclusions of this study with recent industry initiatives, which are pressing for an anthropometric survey of the population in order to obtain data for new practical clothing size standards. In this regard it was proposed that body shape categories should be considered in clothing size [shape] standards, as a focus on body shape may provide a more workable approach for classification of the relationship between key components of female morphology.

40|$|A agricultura brasileira vem se transformando, com grandes estruturas agroindustriais, melhor aproveitamento do espaço físico e melhor uso dos recursos disponíveis, e o trabalhador rural tem preferido morar próximo do local de trabalho, que normalmente são agrovilas. Estas localidades demandam casas com execução simples, rápida e econômica, como as edificações moduladas, confeccionadas com painéis pré-fabricados, com redução do tempo de montagem sobre fundações prontas e redução significativa de resíduos. Como esta tipologia ainda carece de investigações, objetivou-se com este trabalho desenvolver e avaliar painéis de fechamentos verticais (paredes) e horizontais (teto), empregando argamassa armada e garrafas de plástico tipo PET. Os resultados conduziram á uma medida modular de 1, 05 m, com a medida de construção do painel de 1, 04 m de largura, por 2, 75 m de altura, por 0, 15 m de espessura. Os painéis modulares foram definidos para terem sistema fêmea nas extremidades laterais e {{superior}}, permitindo junções em linha, l, t ou em cruz, assim como junção entre painéis verticais e de laje. As fôrmas dos painéis foram de madeira, com 6 cm de espessura, com meio diâmetro de tubo de pvc diâmetro de 7, 5 cm, nas laterais e face superior do painel, para moldar o encaixe tipo fêmea. Os mesmos foram armados com uma gaiola metálica com estribos de aço ca- 60 4, 2 mm dispostos nas duas direções, a cada 20 cm na longitudinal e a cada 25 cm na transversal. Em seu interior foram inseridas 8 colunas de garrafas pet e, por fim, o conjunto foi envolto por tela de viveiro. Os painéis com janela e porta tiveram o seu entorno reforçados com 4 barras de aço ca- 60 8, 0 mm no sentido longitudinal e estribos de 4, 2 mm, a cada 15 cm. A argamassa teve traço em peso de 1, 0 : 2, 0 e fator a/c = 0, 45. No ensaio de compressão dos painéis, as deformações se apresentaram dentro de um inervalo de segurança e bem distante de uma possível ruptura. No ensaio de impacto de corpo duro, a superfície do painel se mostrou adequada, com ótimo desempenho. Nos ensaios de compressão vertical, através de prismas, feito o cálculo, pôde-se concluir que o painel é adequado para a utilização em paredes de residências de até dois pavimentos. Nos ensaios de flexão e de cisalhamento do painel de laje, com carregamento de até 8 kN, conclui-se que a mesma pode ser de piso com acesso ao público. A alvenaria com painéis teve o seu custo cerca de 2, 5 vezes menor que as alvenarias convencionais. Por fim, o sistema modular proposto atende ao preconizado, quer como paredes ou como lajes. Brazilian agriculture {{has been}} transformed, with large agribusiness structures, {{better use of}} space and better use of available resources, and thus the rural workers have preferred to live close to the workplace, which are usually agricultural small villages. These locations require simple homes, fast built and inexpensive, such as modular buildings, made with prefabricated panels, reducing the assembly time on ready foundations, with significant reduction of remains. As this typology still needs investigations, this work was to develop and evaluate vertical (walls) and horizontal (ceiling) panels using mortar and pet plastic bottles. The results led to a modular measure of 1. 05 m, and building measure of 1. 04 m wide by 2. 75 m high by 0. 15 m thick. The modular panels was defined with female system on the side edges and upper, allowing joints on-line, l, t or cross, {{as well as the}} joint between vertical panels and slab. The form for the panels were made of wood, 6 cm thick, with half diameter pvc pipe diameter of 7. 5 cm fixed on the sides and upper face of the panel to shape the <b>female</b> type <b>fitting.</b> The panels were armed with a metal cage with steel stirrups of ca- 60 4. 2 mm arranged in two directions, each 20 cm in longitudinal and 25 cm transversal way. Inside the metal cage were inserted eight columns of pet bottles and, lastly, the assembly was encased in wire netting. The surroundings of window and door panels were reinforced with 4 ca- 60 8. 0 mm steel bars in the longitudinal direction and with 4. 2 mm stirrups every 15 cm. The mortar had weight trace of 1. 0 : 2. 0 and a factor w/c = 0. 45. In the compression test, the panels presented linear deformation, with deflections in a security range, thus far away from a possible breakage. In the hard body impact test, the panel surface was adequate, showing great performance. In the vertical compression test, based on prisms, made the calculation, it was concluded that the panel was suitable for use on walls of houses up to two floors. In the bending test of the slab panel with up to 8 kn of load, it was concluded that it can be used even for slab with public access. In the shear test of the slab panel, as the load was higher than that recommended for public access, the panel was approved {{to be used as a}} ceiling or floor. The masonry panels had its cost about 2. 5 times smaller than the conventional masonry. Finally, the proposed modular system can be recommended both as wall and as slabs...|$|R
