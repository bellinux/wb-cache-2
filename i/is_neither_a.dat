5|$|A dwarf {{planet is}} a planetary-mass object that <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> planet nor a natural satellite. That is, {{it is in}} direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to crush it into a hydrostatically equilibrious shape (usually a spheroid), but has not cleared the {{neighborhood}} of other material around its orbit.|$|E
5|$|A {{metalloid}} is any {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them. There <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use {{in the literature of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|A wasp is any insect of {{the order}} Hymenoptera and {{suborder}} Apocrita that <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> bee nor an ant. The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants.|$|E

5|$|Even though {{voices are}} often used, it <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> concert opera nor a cantata, but a choral symphony. If there is singing, {{almost from the}} beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the {{dramatic}} scenes whose feelings and passions are to be expressed by the orchestra. It is also to introduce the choral masses gradually into the musical development, when their too sudden appearance would have damaged the compositions's unity....|$|E
5|$|Fiji's native birdlife {{has been}} badly {{affected}} by agriculture, deforestation and introduced pests like rats and mongooses. Although Important Bird Areas {{have been established}} on Taveuni and the forest east of Vanua Levu, conservation problems persist. The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man-made landscapes; it <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> ground nor hole nester, so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle mynas. Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity. The potential introduction of other species, such as snakes, or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species.|$|E
5|$|It is fair {{to assume}} that the average Joe/Jane <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> college {{graduate}} nor a high school drop-out. It is, however, difficult {{to determine whether or not}} the average American has some college education as the population is split between those who did and did not attend college. Over the past half century the educational attainment of the US population has significantly increased.|$|E

5|$|An online {{petition}} {{was formed}} {{in response to the}} concerns raised about the planned mosque, calling on the Prime Minister to prevent the building of the mosque; the petition closed with over 250,000 signatures and was at the time the most signed petition on the site. Her Majesty's Government responded that the local planning authorities are responsible for general control of development in their areas and are required to take into consideration the views of interested persons and particularly local communities. In regard to this specific proposal, the government was informed by the Newham London Borough Council that there <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> current planning permission or application for a mosque, nor is one expected in the near future. In September 2012, a planning application was submitted to Newham Council and is under consideration by them.|$|E
5|$|Chris Hemsworth reprises {{his role}} of Thor from {{previous}} MCU {{films in the}} film's mid-credits scene. Additionally, Linda Louise Duan appears, unnamed, as Tina Minoru, Mark Anthony Brighton portrays Daniel Drumm, and Topo Wresniwiro portrays Hamir, all Masters of the Mystic Arts under the Ancient One. The latter is based on Hamir the Hermit, Wong's father in the comics, who was the Ancient One's personal manservant. The character <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> manservant nor Wong's father in the film. Zara Phythian, Alaa Safi, and Katrina Durden portray zealots under Kaecilius, and Pat Kiernan appears as himself. Doctor Strange co-creator Stan Lee makes a cameo appearance as a bus rider reading Aldous Huxley's The Doors of Perception. Amy Landecker was cast as anesthesiologist Bruner, {{but the majority of}} her role was cut from the finished film.|$|E
5|$|Jersey <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> Member State nor an Associate Member of the European Union. It does, however, have a {{relationship}} with the EU governed by article 335(5)(c) TFEU giving effect to Protocol 3 to the UK’s Treaty of Accession in 1972. However, Jersey does not appear on the list of European States and Territories outside the Union and the Communities prepared by the European Council and the Commission. This {{is a result of the}} manner of implementation of the Treaty arrangements under the Act of Accession in 1972. Jersey would have been fully within the European Communities like Gibraltar, being a European territory for whose external relations the United Kingdom was responsible, but that that is limited to the Protocol 3 arrangements under article 355 TFEU to reflect the then existing relationship with the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{search for}} Gliese 3634 b {{started with a}} single {{exposure}} taken with HARPS on March 25, 2009. The results helped verify that Gliese 3634 was an ideal target for a planet search using the radial velocity method (in which the gravitational pull of a planet on its star is measured by observing the resulting Doppler shift), as stellar activity would not overly mask or mimic Doppler spectroscopy measurements. It was also confirmed that Gliese 3634 <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> binary star nor a quickly rotating star, common false positives when searching for transiting planets. Gliese 3634 was observed two weeks later for ten consecutive nights. Analysis of the resulting data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated {{the existence of a}} planet.|$|E
5|$|The seventh symphony, the Sinfonia antartica (1952), a {{by-product}} of the composer's score for Scott of the Antarctic, has consistently divided critical opinion on whether it can be properly classed as a symphony. Alain Frogley in Grove argues that though the work can make a deep impression on the listener, it <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> <b>a</b> true symphony in the understood {{sense of the term}} nor a tone poem and is consequently the least successful of the mature symphonies. The work is in five movements, with wordless vocal lines for female chorus and solo soprano in the first and last movements. In addition to large woodwind and percussion sections the score features a prominent part for wind machine.|$|E
