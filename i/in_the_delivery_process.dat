50|$|Furthermore, it is {{important}} to note that the postal rule is an exception to the general rule that acceptance of an offer takes place when communicated to the offeror. Under the rule, acceptance of an offer is effective as soon as it is posted, notwithstanding it may be lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>process</b> and not received by the offerer. However, the postal acceptance rule does not extend to instantaneous telecommunication methods, such as telephone, facsimile, and, presumably, emails. This means that, where acceptance is communicated electronically, contract is formed when and where acceptance is received, rather than at the moment it is posted. Transactions via electronic communications are now governed by statute.|$|E

Odón conceived {{of the use of}} this same technique that evening in bed and spoke with an obstetrician who encouraged him to move ahead with the idea.

50|$|Herbs {{and other}} plants were used heavily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>process,</b> a {{practice}} also linked to religious belief. For example, a drink sprinkled with powdered sow’s dung was given to relieve labor pain, and fumigation with the fat from a hyena was thought to produce immediate delivery. Most of these practices had little to no medical efficacy, but they did probably provide some placebo effect. Despite the attempt to use science in advancing medical knowledge, the experimentation and teachings of the Hippocratic Corpus were not necessarily {{more effective than the}} traditional customs of midwifery. For example, the Hippocratic writers believed that the womb could move out of place and cause health problems, and the prescribed treatment was to coax the displaced womb back into place using sweet-smelling herbs.|$|E

He only gave short notice, which meant many weapons were lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>process.</b> Lastly, when the ships did leave with {{supplies for the}} Republicans, the journey was extremely slow. Stalin ordered the builders to include false decks {{in the design of}} ships. Then, once the ship left shore it was required to change its flag and change the color of parts of the ship to avoid capture by the Nationalists. However, in 1938, Stalin withdrew his troops and tanks as Republican government policy floundered. Historian Hugh Thomas comments [...] "had they been able to purchase and transport good arms from US, British, and French manufacturers, the socialist and republican members of the Spanish government might have tried to cut themselves loose from Stalin".|$|E

50|$|Since 2005, McGinnis {{has served}} as IOM senior scholar and {{executive}} director of the Roundtable on Value & Science-Driven Health Care. He founded and stewards the IOM’s initiative to accelerate the evolution of a continuously learning health system, described in the Roundtable’s Charter as one “in which science, informatics, incentives, and culture are aligned for continuous improvement and innovation, with best practices seamlessly embedded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>process</b> and new knowledge captured as an integral by-product of the delivery experience.” Motivated by rapid changes in the complexity and costs of care, shortfalls in its performance, and newly-emerging digitally-based tools to address these challenges, the initiative focuses both on improving awareness of the possible and on stimulating activities to capture it. The work to improve understanding is being undertaken through the Roundtable’s Learning Health System Series of publications exploring in detail the prospects and strategies in areas ranging from research and the clinical data utility to shared decision-making and care culture. On the action front, the Roundtable has developed the concept of Innovation Collaboratives, in which the good offices of The National Academies serve to steward cooperative projects requiring a trusted scientific forum to accelerate progress aimed at transformational change in the value, science, and culture of health and health care. Currently, the Roundtable steward about two dozen projects across six collaboratives: Best Practices (health professions societies), Clinical Effectiveness Research (clinical research organizations), Evidence Communication (marketing community), Digital Learning (IT community), Systems Approaches (operations engineers), and Value Incentives (payers and employers).|$|E

40|$|Reducing {{the cost}} of {{construction}} is a primary concern for owners, designers, and builders of facilities. Today, project teams often perform constructability reviews during the design phase to identify design constraints that limit a constructor’s ability to perform construction operations effectively and increase construction cost. However, the current manual process is timeconsuming and prone to error and does not identify the cost implications of constructability problems. Consequently, many constructability problems either go undetected or unnoticed, resulting <b>in</b> inefficiencies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> project <b>delivery</b> <b>process</b> and increased construction cost. This paper describes a vision for on-line computer tools that provide cost-specific constructability feedback to help project teams develop more cost-effective and constructable designs. Through a case example, we outline new functionality and the corresponding formalisms and mechanisms needed to model the cost implications of different constructability problems and identify the specific design conditions that impact constructability and increase construction cost. These contributions will allow project teams to leverage IFC-based product models and enable the necessary functionality to identify constructability problems {{and their impact on}} construction costs early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> project <b>delivery</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R

In addition, due to the extremely high similarity between the two stego images, the embedding capacity is obviously higher than single-image RDH methods with the same distortion. Therefore, dual-image RDH is now attracting much more attention since it can provide the benefits of good security and high embedding capacity.|$|E

However, current knowledge is limited, particularly from low-income countries where affordability is an issue. The objective was therefore to explore {{the relation between}} outcomes of assistive technology use and user involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> service <b>delivery</b> <b>process</b> <b>in</b> Bangladesh. Methods Using structured interviews, data from 136 users of hearing aids and 149 users of manual wheelchairs were collected. Outcomes were measured using the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA), which was adapted for wheelchair users. Predictors of user involvement included preference, measurement and training. Results Users reported outcomes comparable to those found in other high- and low-income countries. User involvement increased the likelihood for reporting better outcomes except for measurement among hearing aid users. Conclusions The findings support the provision of assistive technology as a strategy to improve the participation of people with disabilities in society. They also support current policies and guidelines for user-involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> service <b>delivery</b> <b>process.</b> Simplified strategies for provision of hearing aids may be explored. </p...|$|R
