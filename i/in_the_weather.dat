40|$|High {{performance}} thin-layer chromatography/thin-layer chromatography, X-ray diffraction, and scanning {{electron microscopy}} analysis of thallus and lichen-rock interface samples, were undertaken to characterize biomineralization products in Fuscidea cyathoides, Ochrolechia tartarea, Ophioparma ventosa, and Pertusaria coralline, growing on sandstone in western Norway. Whewellite (monohydrate form of Ca oxalate) was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thallus of all species, but not <b>in</b> any of <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> rinds beneath <b>the</b> species. A significantly higher amount of whewellite was detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thalli of F. cyathoides and O. ventosa than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> other two species.

5|$|In the 19th century, recessions {{frequently}} {{coincided with}} financial crises. Determining {{the occurrence of}} pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of economic statistics, so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the economic system such as wars and variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.|$|E

40|$|We {{report for}} the first time the {{geochemistry}} of rare earth elements (REE) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> crusts of I-type and calc-alkaline to high-K (shoshonitic) granitic rocks at Mamasa and Palu region, Sulawesi Island, Indonesia. <b>The</b> <b>weathered</b> crusts can be divided into horizon A (lateritic profile) and B (weathered horizon). Quartz, albite, kaolinite, halloysite and montmorrilonite prevail <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> crust. Both weathered profiles show that the total REE increased from the parent rocks to the horizon B but significantly decrease toward the upper part (horizon A). LREE are enriched toward the upper part of the profile as shown by La/YbN value. However, HREE concentrations are high in horizon B 1 <b>in</b> Palu profile. <b>The</b> total REE content of <b>the</b> <b>weathered</b> crust are relatively elevated compared to the parent rocks, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lower part of horizon B in Mamasa profile and in horizon B 2 in Palu profile.

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in {{the series}} has become notable for its high difficulty, along with several mechanics that have endured through the years. A key element present since the first Megami Tensei {{is the ability to}} recruit demons to fight alongside the player in battle, alongside the ability to fuse two different demons together to create a more powerful demon. Equivalents to these systems appear in the later Persona titles. The game's most recognizable battle system is the Press Turn system, first introduced in Nocturne. The Press Turn System is a turn-based battle mechanic governing both the player party and enemies, where either party are rewarded an extra turn for striking an enemy's weakness. A Moon Phase System or equivalent, in which phases of the moon or changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> affected the behavior of enemies, is also featured in multiple games.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 16 January, the seas were still rough, whilst hunger and panic had taken over on the wreck. When a large raft {{carrying}} the wounded, two women and six children was launched during a lull <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather,</b> over 120 unwounded men scrambled to board it. This severely overloaded the craft and within minutes a large wave struck the heavy raft and capsized it, drowning all aboard. By the evening, the remaining survivors, without food or fresh water, began to succumb to exposure, {{and at least one}} officer drowned {{in a desperate attempt to}} swim to shore. Throughout the night, the survivors gathered on the less exposed parts of the hull, and, in the hope of staving off death by dehydration, drank sea water, urine, or vinegar from a small barrel that had floated up from the hold. The morning of 17January finally saw a reduction in the storm and the arrival of a small French naval brig, the Arrogante. This ship could not come close without the risk of grounding but sent her boats to the wreck in the hope of rescuing survivors. The brig was joined later in the day by the cutter Aiguille.|$|E
5|$|In the low ground {{west of the}} Passchendaele Ridge, {{three months}} of {{constant}} shelling had blocked the watercourses that normally provided drainage. When rain began falling {{on the night of}} 4 October—which continued intermittently for the next three days—the battlefield was once again transformed into a quagmire of mud, making movement extremely difficult. Gough and Plumer told Haig that they favoured ending the campaign on account of the change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> and general state of the battlefield, however {{the decision was made to}} continue the offensive to gain more favourable winter positions on higher ground. The Battle of Poelcappelle and First Battle of Passchendaele both resulted in many casualties for both sides and failed to achieve any appreciable advance opposite Passchendaele, although they did provide a slightly better starting line for another attack. The four divisions of the Canadian Corps were transferred from the Lens sector to the Ypres Salient to capture Passchendaele. The Canadian Corps relieved the II Anzac Corps on 18 October, from its position along the valley between Gravenstafel Ridge and the heights at Passchendaele and immediately began planning for the offensive. Interestingly, it was virtually the same front as had been occupied by the 1st Canadian Division back in April 1915.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{behaviour}} of iron <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> ofbiotite <b>in</b> a {{sedentary soil}} profile developed on appinite {{has been investigated}} using the M 6 ssbauer ffect. Both Fe z+ and Fe a+ in sites with cis and trans hydroxyl groups were observed atvarious tages <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> sequence. <b>The</b> results indicate {{that there is little}} or no ordering of <b>the</b> octahedral cations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fresh biotite and hydrobiotite, but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more <b>weathered</b> interstratifled vermiculite-chlorite samples Fe a+ concentrates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more distorted sites. No evidence was obtained for the presence ofan anisotropic recoil-free fraction. <b>IN</b> <b>the</b> laboratory, biotite can be readily converted to vermiculite by a simple cation-exchange process involving replacement of interlayer K + by a more highly hydrated cation such as Mg 2 + or Ca ~+. However, under natural conditions <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> of biotite is more complex since weathered biotites, vermiculitized to varying degrees, are invariably more highly oxidized than fresh flakes separated from related parent rock. The octahedral sheet is therefore affected. Because of the importance of the degree of oxidation of biotites for potassium retention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> soil (Barshad and Kishk, I 968; Robert and Pedro, I 968), <b>the</b> <b>weathering</b> reactions of <b>the</b> mineral have been investigated in detail...|$|R
