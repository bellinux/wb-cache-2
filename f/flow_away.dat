5|$|Formation of {{approximately}} the current {{depth of the}} Colorado River's Grand Canyon by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper. Headward erosion {{of one of those}} tributaries, the Paria River, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater. The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault. Erosion from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing rim of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential erosion and frost wedging create the hoodoos. Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they <b>flow</b> <b>away</b> from the rim. Erosion continues in this fashion today.|$|E
5|$|Radar {{results from}} SHARAD {{suggested}} that features termed lobate debris aprons (LDAs) contain {{large amounts of}} water ice. Of interest {{from the days of}} the Viking Orbiters, these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests <b>flow</b> <b>away</b> from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth. SHARAD has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that pure water ice makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections). Based on the experiments of the Phoenix lander and the studies of the Mars Odyssey from orbit, water ice is known to exist just under the surface of Mars in the far north and south (high latitudes).|$|E

25|$|The falls, {{like the}} clove and creek {{with which they}} share a name, are a {{relatively}} recent addition to the Catskills in terms of geologic time.

25|$|Widespread {{distribution}} of Permo-Carboniferous glacial sediments in South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Australia {{was one of}} the major pieces of evidence for the theory of continental drift. The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented glacial striations and deposits called tillites, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of Gondwana, which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated glacial <b>flow</b> <b>away</b> from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations, as well as being contiguous with each other.|$|E
25|$|Rip {{currents}} are water {{channels that}} <b>flow</b> <b>away</b> from the shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current {{appears to be}} an area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.|$|E

500|$|Chat Moss {{presented}} a significant {{challenge to the}} engineers constructing the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1826 {{because of the difficulty}} in providing a solid base for the track, in particular at a location known as Blackpool Hole. George Stephenson [...] was the engineer in charge of the project, and his initial idea was to dump enough spoil in the bog so that it would reach the bottom. This approach turned out to be impractical however, as the liquidity of the bog allowed the spoil to <b>flow</b> <b>away</b> from where the track was to be laid. The eventual solution, to build the line on a [...] "floating" [...] wood and stone foundation, was hailed as a [...] "great triumph of engineering". The first train ran through Chat Moss in 1830, and the line is still in use today.|$|E
500|$|Once {{part of the}} supercontinent Gondwana, {{the island}} of Madagascar has been {{isolated}} since it broke away from eastern Africa (~160mya), Antarctica (~80–130mya), and India (~80–90mya). Since ancestral lemurs {{are thought to have}} originated in Africa around 62 to 65mya, they must have crossed the Mozambique Channel, a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560km (350mi). In 1915, paleontologist William Diller Matthew noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar (including lemurs) can only be accounted for by random rafting events, where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers. This form of biological dispersal can occur randomly over millions of years. In the 1940s, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson coined the term [...] "sweepstakes hypothesis" [...] for such random events. Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar, but until recently this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong ocean currents <b>flow</b> <b>away</b> from the island. In , a report demonstrated that around 60mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1,650km (1,030mi) south of their present-day positions, placing them in a different ocean gyre, producing currents that ran counter to what they are today. The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today, which would have pushed a raft along faster, shortening the trip to 30days or less—short enough for a small mammal to survive easily. As the continental plates drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed, effectively isolating the lemurs {{and the rest of the}} terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa. Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors, the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving arboreal mammalian groups, such as squirrels. They were also spared from having to compete with monkeys, which evolved later. The intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness of monkeys gave them an advantage over other primates in exploiting the environment.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the last}} glacial period, much of {{northern}} Europe, Asia, North America, Greenland and Antarctica {{was covered by}} ice sheets. The ice was as thick as three kilometres during the last glacial maximum about 20,000 years ago. [...] The enormous weight of this ice caused {{the surface of the}} Earth's crust to deform and warp downward, forcing the viscoelastic mantle material to <b>flow</b> <b>away</b> from the loaded region. [...] At the end of each glacial period when the glaciers retreated, the removal of the weight from the depressed land led to slow (and still ongoing) uplift or rebound of the land and the return flow of mantle material back under the deglaciated area. [...] Due to the extreme viscosity of the mantle, it will take many thousands of years for the land to reach an equilibrium level.|$|E
2500|$|Khuzestan {{has great}} {{potential}} [...] for agricultural expansion, {{which is almost}} unrivaled by the country's other provinces. Large and permanent rivers flow over the entire territory contributing to the fertility of the land. Karun, Iran's most effluent river, 850 kilometers long, flows into the Persian Gulf through this province. The agricultural potential of most of these rivers, however, and particularly in their lower reaches, is hampered {{by the fact that}} their waters carry salt, the amount of which increases as the rivers <b>flow</b> <b>away</b> from the source mountains and hills. In case of the Karun, a single tributary river, Rud-i Shur ("Salty River") that flows into the Karun above Shushtar contributes most of the salt that the river carries. As such, the freshness of the Karun waters can be greatly enhanced if the Rud-i Shur could be diverted away from the Karun. The same applies to the Jarahi and Karkheh in their lower reaches. Only the Marun is exempt from this.|$|E
2500|$|Coal mining in Britain, {{particularly}} in South Wales, started early. Before the steam engine, pits were often shallow bell pits following a seam of coal along the surface, which were abandoned as the coal was extracted. In other cases, if the geology was favourable, the coal was mined {{by means of}} an adit or drift mine driven into the side of a hill. Shaft mining was done in some areas, but the limiting factor was the problem of removing water. It could be done by hauling buckets of water up the shaft or to a sough (a tunnel driven into a hill to drain a mine). In either case, the water had to be discharged into a stream or ditch at a level where it could <b>flow</b> <b>away</b> by gravity. The introduction of the steam pump by Savery in 1698 and the Newcomen steam engine in 1712 greatly facilitated the removal of water and enabled shafts to be made deeper, enabling more coal to be extracted. These were developments that had begun before the Industrial Revolution, but the adoption of John Smeaton's improvements to the Newcomen engine followed by James Watt's more efficient steam engines from the 1770s reduced the fuel costs of engines, making mines more profitable. [...] The Cornish engine, developed in the 1810s, was much more efficient than the Watt steam engine.|$|E
