30|$|The linear {{variation}} {{fields and}} their parameters {{play an important}} role in map assessments. An <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreter</b> can easily recognize the zones of smooth linear changes. Due to certain geological conditions, however, it is not always easy to notice them in gravity and magnetic anomaly maps. In such cases, one may need an approach to enhance the lineaments. To obviate such problems, directional derivative and anomaly separation are the classical approaches. The first stage in lineament identification is usually the image enhancement and boundary detection processes applied to the digitized input images.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} process and product of interpreters with different levels of experience and explores the expertise approach (cf. Ericsson, Charness and Hoffman 2007) as applied to interpreters. The expertise approach claims that highly skilled performers, regardless of their chosen field, use {{the same type of}} strategies in order to reach the top levels of their profession. An important feature of the expertise approach is deliberate practice, a specific type of practice that highly skilled performers engage in so as to improve their performance. The dissertation is based on four different studies featuring two different sets of participants. Two data sets – a cross-sectional material with nine participants on three different levels of interpreting experience (none, short and long), and a long-term material with three interpreters recorded at two different points in time – were analysed in terms of both processing and product data. The interpreting process was studied by retrospectively analysing and categorizing processing problems, monitoring and strategies, while the interpreting product was analysed by using holistic rating scales for intelligibility and level of information transfer of the interpreting product. In-depth interviews were also conducted with the long-term participants in order to investigate their perception of deliberate practice and their own view of their skill development. An important and integral part of the dissertation, apart from the results, was the development of the holistic rating scales (adapted from Carroll 1966), and the development of an in-depth interview study. The conclusions of the dissertation are that there are measurable differences of interpreting skill between performers with little or no interpreting experience and performers with long interpreting experience, but this finding could not be supported by the long-term (intra-individual) study. Differences between the groups in the cross-sectional material could also be observed from the process data. <b>Experienced</b> <b>interpreters</b> encountered fewer processing problems than less <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreters</b> and had more strategies at hand to solve problems. There were also clear differences in terms of instances of monitoring (i. e. controlling the interpreting process and output) between <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreters</b> and other subjects. Monitoring seemed to be a dividing line between <b>experienced</b> and inexperienced <b>interpreters,</b> and <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreters</b> had more processing capacity available to monitor themselves. This was also to a certain extent supported in the in-depth interviews, where the participants reported how they constantly evaluate themselves in terms of improving performance. A key assumption established {{in the beginning of the}} project – that <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreters</b> would claim, in the in-depth interviews, that they practise a great deal – was not supported, to our surprise. The interpreters recounted many practice-like activities but stated that they did not actually practise.

All anomalies with fitted moments above 0. 05 Am 2 were excavated. During the survey the magnetic remanence metric was predicted but not used to guide the discrimination. The retrospective analysis presented here reveals that discrimination using remanence would have significantly reduced {{the total number of}} anomalies (with good dipolar fits) that needed to be excavated, from 524 to 290 while still recovering all 69 UXO. The false alarm rate (FAR) was reduced from 6. 3 to 2. 9 non-UXOs excavated per UXO found. At a cut-off of 75 % remanence, 77 % of anomalies due to shrapnel and metallic debris and 64 % of geological anomalies were rejected. Magnetic geology in the area introduced a significant human-element into the interpretation process.

This is timely information due to recent great {{concern of the}} society about the rapid increasing in plantation areas throughout {{the region and the}} controversy about Eucalyptus plantations and the hydrological cycle, especially involving the depletion of ground water reservoir. The methodology included visual interpretation of georeferenced Landsat ETM+ imagery acquired in 2006 / 2007, use of municipalities boundaries layer to report results for each municipality, a thematic reference map with a layer of forest patches and Eucalyptus plantations of the Atlantic Forest from the São Paulo Forestry Institute based on 1995 - 2000 data. Results showed that Paraibuna and Santa Branca municipalities have the largest areas planted to Eucalyptus, with 20319. 8 and 8641. 3 hectares, respectively. An important conclusion from this work is that several areas close to the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira mountains have large Eucalyptus plantations, which raises concern because these are quite vulnerable environments and some of these plantations may lay over permanent preservation areas and be a source of pollutants from the Eucalyptus cultivation that can spread though the water table causing contamination downstream.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{efficiency}} of rapid biophysical profile in antepartum fetal surveillance and ability to predict adverse perinatal outcome and to compare it with the gold standard full biophysical profile. The objective was to determine the correlation between the rapid biophysical profile (RBP) and the full biophysical profile (FBP) and to compare the individual scores with pregnancy outcomes. Methods: A prospective study was performed in 153 singleton pregnancies with no fetal anomalies between 34 - 42 weeks of gestation. All participants received both the standard (FBP) and the new RBP. Abnormal fetal test was defined as having a score of and # 8804; 6 for FBP or and # 8804; 2 for RBP. The main outcome measured was Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) between both examinations and also between each examination and pregnancy outcomes measured in terms of Apgar scores and NICU (Neonatal Intensive Care Unit) admissions Results: The data showed a positive correlation between the two tests (rs = 0. 62; p < 0. 0001). Out of the individual biophysical variables, only NST (Non Stress Test) had a positive correlation with RBP. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of RBP in predicting adverse outcomes was found to be 71. 4 %, 87. 1 %, 35. 7 %. 96. 8 % respectively. Conclusions: The statistically significant positive correlation between RBP and FBP has been revealed. Due to its simplicity, rapidity, and no need for <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreter,</b> the RBP may be alternatively used as a primary screening antepartum fetal test in the overcrowded obstetric center.

40|$|Seismic {{attributes}} {{are routinely}} used to accelerate and quantify {{the interpretation of}} tectonic features in 3 D seismic data. Coherence (or variance) cubes delineate the edges of megablocks and faulted strata, curvature delineates folds and flexures, while spectral components delineate lateral changes in thickness and lithology. Seismic attributes are at their best in extracting subtle and easy to overlook features on high-quality seismic data. However, seismic attributes can also exacerbate otherwise subtle effects such as acquisition footprint and velocity pull-up/push-down, as well as small processing and velocity errors in seismic imaging. As a result, the chance that an interpreter will suffer a pitfall is inversely proportional {{to his or her}} <b>experience.</b> <b>Interpreters</b> with a history of making conventional maps from vertical seismic sections will have previously encountered problems associated with acquisition, processing, and imaging. Because they know that attributes are a direct measure of the seismic amplitude data, they are not surprised that such attributes “accurately” represent these familiar errors. Less <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreters</b> may encounter these errors for the first time. Regardless of their level of <b>experience,</b> all <b>interpreters</b> are faced with increasingly larger seismic data volumes in which seismic attributes become valuable tools that aid in mapping and communicating geologic features of interest to their colleagues. In terms of attributes, structural pitfalls fall into two general categories: false structures due to seismic noise and processing errors including velocity pull-up/push-down due to lateral variations in the overburden and errors made in attribute computation by not accounting for structural dip. We evaluate these errors using 3 D data volumes and find areas where present-day attributes do not provide the images we want...|$|R
40|$|The {{component}} processes {{specific to}} simultaneous interpreting and common to interpreting and listening were investigated. <b>Experienced</b> conference <b>interpreters</b> and inexperienced bilinguals performed aural-to-oral simultaneous interpreting {{of a narrative}} and a procedure from English into French and then gave a free recall of each immediately afterwards. A comparison group of bilinguals performed a simple listening task with the same materials.

The results were viewed as evidence that interpreting involves the same component processes as normal listening comprehension rather than constituting a specialized comprehension skill. Analyses of text-structure variables provided evidence for influence of high-level conceptual processing and other component processes both on line and off line.

40|$|The Sula Ridge Reef complex, a large cold-water {{coral reef}} {{structure}} on the mid-Norwegian shelf built mainly by Lophelia pertusa, was mapped entirely using a high-resolution sidescan sonar. In addition, a dense echosounding grid, underwater vide observations and dives using the manned research submersible Jago, provided precise high-quality ground-truthing, and allowed a detailed interpretation of the reef structure and its surrounding geological features. The result of this visual sidescan sonar interpretation is a facies map that delineates different potential habitats within the coral reef environment, e. g. live coral reef, dead coral structure and sediment-covered coral/rubble, etc. In an attempt to improve this interpretation, computer-assisted image analysis was applied to a representative section of the sonar data to try to reveal patterns 'invisible' to the human eye (using the TexAn software). Texture analysis uses Grey-Level Cooccurrence Matrices (GLCMs) to calculate statistical indices quantifying the distribution of grey levels and their spatial relationship within the image.

Overall, it shows that texture analysis is a useful tool to make facies/habitat mapping from sidescan sonar easier and faster, revealing details overlooked during visual interpretation.

40|$|Myocardial {{perfusion}} quantification {{by means}} of Contrast-Enhanced Cardiac Magnetic Resonance images relies on time consuming frame-by-frame manual tracing of regions of interest. In this Thesis, a novel automated technique for myocardial segmentation and non-rigid registration {{as a basis for}} perfusion quantification is presented. The proposed technique is based on three steps: reference frame selection, myocardial segmentation and non-rigid registration. In the first step, the reference frame in which both endo- and epicardial segmentation will be performed is chosen. Endocardial segmentation is achieved {{by means of}} a statistical region-based level-set technique followed by a curvature-based regularization motion. Epicardial segmentation is achieved by means of an edge-based level-set technique followed again by a regularization motion. To take into account the changes in position, size and shape of myocardium throughout the sequence due to out of plane respiratory motion, a non-rigid registration algorithm is required. The proposed non-rigid registration scheme consists in a novel multiscale extension of the normalized cross-correlation algorithm in combination with level-set methods. The myocardium is then divided into standard segments. Contrast enhancement curves are computed measuring the mean pixel intensity of each segment over time, and perfusion indices are extracted from each curve. The overall approach has been tested on synthetic and real datasets. For validation purposes, the sequences have been manually traced by an <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreter,</b> and contrast enhancement curves as well as perfusion indices have been computed. Comparisons between automatically extracted and manually obtained contours and enhancement curves showed high inter-technique agreement. Comparisons of perfusion indices computed using both approaches against quantitative coronary angiography and visual interpretation demonstrated that the two technique have similar diagnostic accuracy. In conclusion, the proposed technique allows fast, automated and accurate measurement of intra-myocardial contrast dynamics, and may thus address the strong clinical need for quantitative evaluation of myocardial perfusion...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Serial peak expiratory flow (PEF) {{measurement}} {{is usually}} the most appropriate {{first step in the}} confirmation of occupational asthma. Visual assessment of the plotted record is more sensitive and specific than statistical methods so far reported. The use of visual analysis is limited by lack of widespread expertise in the methods. A computer assisted diagnostic aid (OASYS- 2) has been developed which is based on a scoring system developed from visual analysis. This removes the requirement for an <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreter</b> and should lead to the more widespread use of the technique. METHODS: PEF records were collected from workers attending an occupational lung disease clinic for investigation of suspected occupational asthma and from workers participating in a study of respiratory symptoms in a postal sorting office. PEF records were divided into two development sets and two gold standard sets. The latter consisted of records from workers in which a final diagnosis had been reached by a method other than PEF recording. An experienced observer scored individual work and rest periods for the two development set PEF records; linear discriminant analysis was used to compare measurements taken from development set 1 records with visual scores. Two equations were produced which allowed prediction of scores for individual work or rest periods. The development set 2 was used to determine how these scores should be used to produce a whole record score. The first gold standard set was used to determine the whole record score which best separated those with and without occupational asthma. The second set determined the sensitivity and specificity of the chosen score. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty eight PEF records were collected from 169 workers and divided into two development sets (81 and 60 records) and two gold standard sets (60 and 67 records). Linear discriminant analysis produced equations predicting the score for work periods incorporating five indices of PEF change and one for rest periods using seven indices. These equations correctly predicted the score for development set 1 work and rest periods on 61 % of occasions (kappa = 0. 47). The whole record score for development set 2 records, after weighting for definite or definitely no occupational effect, correlated with the visual score (correlation coefficient 0. 86). Comparison with gold standard set 1 identified a cut off which proved to have a sensitivity of 75 % and a specificity of 94 % for an independent diagnosis of occupational asthma when applied to gold standard set 2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the sensitivity and specificity of analysing PEF records for occupational asthma using OASYS- 2 approaches that of visual analysis, but it should be absolutely reproducible. The performance of OASYS- 2 is more specific and approaches the sensitivity of other statistical methods of analysis. The evaluation {{of a large number of}} PEF records from workers exposed to different sensitising agents suggests that these results should be robust and should be repeatable in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of prior}} {{knowledge}} in the simultaneous interpreting of specialized speeches This doctoral research explores the role of advance preparation in the simultaneous interpreting of specialized speeches. Specifically, this research is based on three theoretical and empirical pillars: the role of prior topic {{knowledge in the}} comprehension of specialized discourse; the cognitive process of interpreting {{and the development of}} expertise in simultaneous interpreting; and {{the current state of the}} art in the study of advance preparation in Interpreting Studies. Theoretical framework It could be said that simultaneous interpreting is the mode of linguistic mediation most often used in technical and scientific meetings and conferences. In these bilingual or multilingual events, the speeches have a series of features in which prior topic knowledge plays a crucial role, more relevant than for other genres like narrative texts (Graesser, Le??n and Otero, 2002). Scientific discourse is a text and discourse genre whose main objective is to explain and persuade. This discourse is produced by members of a group, discipline or profession (a discourse community as defined by Swales, 1990) who share a common knowledge base and interests in similar phenomena. Specialized speeches are directed mainly at a primary audience, like the scientists, researchers, PhD students who attend the conference as delegates. But they also have a secondary, unintended, audience, that is the scientific journalists, writers and linguistic mediators involved in the event, such as translators and interpreters. The primary audience of specialized or scientific discourse is familiar with its textual structure and conceptual basis as they have prior knowledge of the terms and arguments presented by speakers, as well as of the textual clues that guide their comprehension processes (Goldman and Bisanz, 2002). However, most interpreters are not experts in all the specialized topics which they interpret throughout their professional career. This is why they are a secondary, non-expert, audience, for which the main features of scientific discourse, i. e. specialized terminology, dense and complex structures and a complex line of logic reasoning, hinder comprehension, since this secondary audience lacks the prior knowledge necessary to build a coherent and complete representation of the speech (Britton, 1994). Now, simultaneous interpreting is a highly complex task, which demands a high amount of cognitive resources, of memory and attention within a restricted temporal framework. In simultaneous interpreting, an interpreter has to understand a message delivered in one language whilst she is translating and producing a previous segment in a different language. As will be explained in detail later in this work, most theoretical models of the interpreting process recognize three macro-processes: a) comprehension of a segment of source speech; b) reformulation in target language; c) production of an equivalent segment in target language. Aside from these three macroprocesses, other executive operations of coordination and monitoring of output concur. The speed of production of the target speech is widely restricted by the speed of delivery of the source speech, so the interval of time allowed to conduct these operations is of merely a couple of seconds. (See a recent review in Christoffels and de Groot, 2005 and Padilla, Bajo and Macizo, 2007). Thus, the demands of comprehending, translating and producing a complex speech, about a topic with which they are not always familiar, in a very brief interval of time, results in interpreters having to work close to the limit of their cognitive capacity and therefore having to apply a set of strategies to avoid the interruption of the process and of interpretation. According to Gile??s ??Efforts?? model?? (1995 / 2009), interpreters must maintain a balance in the allocation of their limited cognitive resources in order to avoid the saturation of their processing system. Both practitioners and researchers agree on the relevance of advance preparation in the achievement of quality and satisfactory performance in simultaneous interpreting. The International Association of Conference Interpreters (AIIC), for instance, a leader in terms of professional standards and quality of performance in conference interpreters, highlights the importance of advance preparation by including it in the set of working conditions that make simultaneous interpreting possible and requires its members to demand conference documents in advance (AIIC, 2009) and to prepare them thoroughly for each assignment (AIIC, 2004). The prescriptive and descriptive literature on the professional aspects of interpretation, and simultaneous interpreting in particular reflect the same spirit. There is a consensus on the notion that interpreters are not specialists on every topic and that the topics that are interpreted vary constantly. For this reason, the literature presents methods and suggestions on how to exploit relevant documentation or, more recently, how to find relevant resources on the Internet, and extract specialized terminology and information that will support a more accurate interpretation. Most of these authors share the intuition that advance preparation might support anticipation or help accelerate the interpreting process (Seleskovitch, 1976; Moser, 1978; Gile, 2005). The literature also suggests how to prepare a glossary, which is a useful reference tool to consult while interpreting in the booth (see Seleskovitch, 1962; Gile, 1986; Moser-Mercer, 1992; Martin, 2002 y Donovan, 2001). However, on the empirical side only a few researchers have attempted to investigate the role of having background information for an interpreting task, or its effect on processing variables (like time-lag or response/reaction/production times) and performance (different measures of translation quality or accuracy). What is more, the few investigators that have shown an interest in this issue have faced huge methodological challenges (see, for instance, Anderson, 1979, 1994 and Lamberger-Felber, 2003). The results so far are not conclusive and even paradoxical, as those found by Griffin (1995) and Macizo and Bajo (2009), who observed longer reaction times in the conditions in which participants performed a translation task after studying relevant background information. For all these reasons, we believe that there is a research gap in Interpreting Studies, specifically in the research of the role of advance preparation. We argue that exploring the role of an instance of topic knowledge acquisition is of interest to Interpreting Studies, considering the role of prior knowledge in the comprehension of scientific discourse and the cognitive complexity of the simultaneous interpreting task. We also believe that it is relevant that research on this issue takes into account possible differences between experienced and inexperienced interpreters as this may shed light on the role of preparation at different stages of interpreting competence development. Empirical and experimental research on the acquisition and development of interpreting skills by deliberate practice also shows that professional interpreters' performance is qualitatively and quantitatively different from that of inexperienced interpreters or bilinguals and that these skills are susceptible of training and develop specifically to carry out the task of simultaneous interpreting (Christoffels, de Groot and Kroll, 2006; Yudes, 2010; Liu, 2008). Objectives, research questions and hypotheses The main objective of this study was to contribute to the empirical study of simultaneous interpreting by investigating the role of advance preparation in the simultaneous interpreting of scientific speeches. This subject has been addressed by previous researchers, but the results have been rather elusive as they have encountered important methodological obstacles. Thus, the main research question was: Is it possible to observe the effect of advance preparation in simultaneous interpreting? This question aims to test certain intuitive opinions that emerge from experience in professional and interpreter training practices and that are shared by several authors in Interpreting Studies literature. These intuitions, as Gile (2002 : 26) calls them, point towards a positive effect of preparation that might be reflected both in accelerated processing and in enhanced performance. However, testing these intuitions has not been an easy task. Simultaneous interpreting is a complex linguistic and human activity during which several variables come into play. In some previous studies, the lack of control over these variables has impeded the observation of clear effects (Anderson, 1979, 1994). In other cases, the high variability of the data did not allow for the extrapolation of the results to larger populations and statistical significance was not tested (Lamberger-Felber, 2003). Furthermore, in terms of knowledge acquisition, the study of speech manuscripts is not necessarily the same cognitive activity as the study of related conference materials and the elaboration of a glossary. In order to overcome these deficiencies, an experimental approach was taken and special attention was paid to controlling extraneous variables both in the design of materials, task, procedure and in the data analyses. We expected that this experimental setup would allow for the observation of measurable data and of a significant effect of advance preparation in processing and performance. However, the study of the role of prior topic knowledge in comprehension and simultaneous interpreting is quite a broad subject. In this research we have narrowed it down and restricted it to three specific research questions, objectives and hypotheses. As mentioned above, simultaneous interpreting is considered to be a complex task, not only in terms of cognitive processing, but also as a communicative activity. Hence the first specific research question is a two-fold research question: Does advance preparation have an effect on i) simultaneous interpreting processing; and ii) the accuracy of target speeches. Thus, the first specific objective of this research is to obtain a wide overview, a preliminary but comprehensive idea of the effect of advance preparation by measuring variables that have been traditionally studied in interpreting research, such as ear-voice span and target speech accuracy. Some researchers and scholars in Interpreting Studies have typically suggested that prior knowledge supports faster processing and improves performance and accuracy. Our first specific hypothesis is, then, that the acquisition of prior topic knowledge, by means of advance preparation, will be reflected in better processing and performance, as measured by ear-voice span, target speech accuracy scores and lexical-semantic content. Our second specific objective is to explore the role of advance preparation in overcoming difficult features of specialized source speeches. We considered that since coping with difficulties involves strategic problem-solving processing, it would be interesting to analyze the choice of reformulation strategies applied. So we set out to this task by measuring ear-voice span, target speech accuracy and the choice of reformulation strategies at segments of source speech classified as ??neutral?? and ??difficult??. Also, we further classified difficult segments according to the type of difficulty that presented: specialized terminology, complex syntactic structure and non-redundant information (proper names, figures, acronyms, etc.). Therefore, our second specific hypothesis is that advance preparation will support the interpreting process and performance in segments that contained difficult features of scientific speeches, such as terminology, complex syntactic structure and non-redundant information. We also expected that difficulty could have a detrimental effect on processing and performance, but hypothesized that preparation could probably contribute to mitigating this effect. Finally, due to the results obtained by the group of interpreting students, a second group of experienced interpreters was added to the design to learn more about the effect of preparation as a function of expertise in simultaneous interpreting. The specific research question in this regard was: Do experienced and inexperienced interpreters differ in the benefit they gain from advance preparation? Hence, the third objective of this research deals with investigating the role of expertise and its possible interaction with the acquisition of prior topic knowledge. Our hypotheses in this regard are less specific since, as reviewed in Chapter 3, there are aspects of simultaneous interpreting in which superior performance has been observed in experienced interpreters, when compared to novice interpreters (target speech accuracy, for instance). However, expertise research in interpreting is still in early stages of development, so any hypothesis in this regard needs to be taken with caution. Our third specific hypothesis is that experienced interpreters will show superior performance to students, as measured by target speech accuracy scores. We also expect that preparation has a positive effect on both groups, although we would not know to what extent. We further hypothesized that preparation could interact with expertise and perhaps bring students?? performance closer to that of an <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreter.</b> Furthermore, it could also be expected that we find aspects of processing and performance in which both experienced and inexperienced interpreters behave similarly. Methods Participants. Twenty-three participants, 16 students of English-Spanish conference interpreting and 7 professional interpreters participated in the study. Student interpreters form the advanced students?? group and professional interpreters, the professional interpreters?? group. Both groups were homogenous in terms of linguistic proficiency in their L 1 language skills and in their oral comprehension skills in L 2. Differences in L 2 reading, speaking and writing have been explained by the professional interpreters?? age and the period of time they have been actively using L 2, both of which are, as would be expected, significantly longer in the group of professional interpreters. There was a significant difference in the working memory span of both groups, - interpreters in the professional group had a significantly higher memory span than student interpreters. The students who participated in this study had a high record of academic performance, as rated by their own interpreting trainers at the Universidad de Granada and the Universidad de Las Am??ricas, and are thus considered advanced interpreting students. Interpreters had, on average, 11 years of experience in professional interpreting. Participants also reported having little to no knowledge about the topics, ideas and terminology of the experimental source speeches, especially the students and no significant differences were found between the groups in their prior knowledge about the speeches' topic, ideas and terminology and the personal interest participants had about them. Materials. The main materials used in this research were the experimental speeches and the preparation materials. Six speeches were pre-selected from real life scientific seminars available on the internet. Transcriptions of these six pre-selected speeches were handed to a panel of independent judges (four Conference interpreting lecturers and professors at the Department of Translation and Interpreting, University of Granada) who were asked i) to assess, on a scale of 1 ?? 7, the overall difficulty of each speech; and ii) to choose from the pool of six speeches the two that were more similar in degree of difficulty. Two pairs of speeches emerged with a very high correlation (r =. 92), of which the pair with the highest degree of concordance among judges (Kendall W = 1) was selected as the two experimental source speeches. The judges were also asked to identify in these speeches the segments that they considered to be difficult to interpret without proper prior knowledge. Forty-six segments were identified as the "Difficult". According to the judges' explanations, these segments were further classified as having a lexical, syntactic or semantic difficulty. Each speech contained then 46 difficult segments and 34 neutral segments, or segments that should not entail a difficulty for participants considering their linguistic and interpreting competence. The topics of the experimental speeches were ??The genetics of psychiatric disorders?? and ??Neuroscience of visual perception??. The source speeches were later recorded by a native speaker of English at a mean delivery rate of 99. 9 words per minute. The preparation materials included a 250 -word summary of the speech; a CV or brief biography of the speakers (80 -word); a slide presentation based on the speech (9 slides), a mock programme of the conference where the speech was supposedly presented (for communicative context) and a brief English-Spanish glossary that contained 30 specialised terms extracted from the corresponding source speech. The glossary contained the specialized term in English, its equivalent term in Spanish and, in some cases, additional information about the term or concept. These preparation materials were designed and written by the investigator, taking as a reference the set of documents and types of information that professional interpreters would realistically use when preparing for a conference in advance, based on her personal experience as a conference interpreter and as several authors in interpreting training literature suggest (see Chapter 4 and Moser-Mercer, 1992; Gile, 1995; Abril and Ortiz, 1998; Donovan, 2001; among others). Task and procedure. In the experimental task, participants had to simultaneously interpret two speeches from English into Spanish. One speech was to be interpreted with advance preparation, while the second speech had to be interpreted without advance preparation. The order of the experimental conditions (preparation) and of the presentation of the speeches was counterbalanced in four conditions (see Table 5. 6). In the preparation condition, participants were first given 30 minutes to study the preparation materials. They were provided with the preparation materials and supplied with pens, markers and additional blank sheets, so they could take their own notes. The speech was interpreted immediately afterwards. In the non-preparation condition, participants were instructed to interpret without any preparation or knowledge about the topic of the speech. Both tasks were separated by a 15 -minute break. Results and conclusions The results of the study show that advance preparation supported a more efficient processing and performance. Both the students and experienced interpreters who participated in our study obtained significantly better results when they had the opportunity to prepare relevant documentation for the interpretation task. The interpretation was more efficient since they produced significantly richer and more accurate target speeches, in terms of use of specialized terminology, an idiomatic rendition in the target language and a correct and complete rendition of the source speech meaning, while the time-lag allocated for this processing was significantly shorter. Advance preparation also had an effect on the choice of reformulation strategies. When participants prepared the task, their pattern of strategies was very homogenous. They consistently used the terminology provided in the glossary and applied the minimax strategy, or a minimum manipulation of the input. On the contrary, when participants did not prepare for the task, a host of remedial strategies appeared and both groups resorted more often to omission, paraphrasis, lexical and syntactic transcodification and generalization, especially when dealing with difficult segments. We were also able to observe how an increased level of difficulty affected processing and performance by slowing down ear-voice span and deteriorating the accuracy of the target segments. However, we could also observe that advance preparation played a significant role in mitigating these effects in the two experimental groups. Finally, our expertise approach allowed us to establish a set of aspects in which inexperienced and experienced interpreters behaved differently but also some in which they behaved similarly. The effect of expertise was significant in the superior performance that professional interpreters showed in the accuracy of the target speeches and in the frequency with which they chose the most efficient reformulation strategies, such as the use of direct target language equivalent and the minimax strategy. However, there were no significant differences in the ear-voice span of both groups, nor in some of the remedial strategies that they applied in the non-preparation condition or at neutral segments. Moreover, in the case of omissions, students omitted more segments than professional interpreters, but only in the non-preparation condition. Our third hypothesis dealt with the possible differences that we might find in the processing and performance of interpreting students and professional interpreters. We expected that the performance of professional interpreters would be superior to that of students, as measured by target speech accuracy scores. We also expected to observe differences in the other varia...|$|E

Vertical 70 mm color infrared photographs at scales of 1 : 6, 000 and 1 : 12, 000 were taken on several dates during 1979 - 80 over a St. Paul, Minnesota study area containing high incidence of DED.

However, salt formations are challenging geophysical interpretation issues and need to be addressed properly. In this paper we discuss how non-seismic data can be integrated in the cycle of iterative depth migration and model updating leading to better seismic imaging results and a more reliable prospect evaluation. Especially areas involving complex salt geometries, as in the Gulf of Mexico or offshore Brazil, are affected by issues limiting the success of pre-stack depth migrations; e. g., reduced data quality, incorrect structural concepts, unresolved geometries, or inaccurate velocities. Our approach to tackle these problems is the integration of data from independent geophysical techniques, which are linked to the same lithological model but respond to different geophysical properties, like density, susceptibility, or resistivity. Key ingredients for a successful application of this concept- besides a reasonable seismic coverage- are: adequate high-resolution non-seismic data, constraining geological boundary conditions, a flexible software environment for integrated 3 D modeling, inversion and visualization, <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreters</b> with excellent inter-disciplinary communication skills, and a proven workflow, adjustable to the specific project requirements.

The commercialisation of very high spatial resolution (VHR) satellite images such as IKONOS and QuickBird especially allows the detection of individual buildings or a block of buildings. However, a better spatial resolution image requires a more complicated processing. A VHR image possesses much more information than a coarser one. Pixel-based and texture-based methods, which are successfully used for coarse spatial resolution images, show certain limitation in processing VHR satellite images. Currently, visual interpretation of VHR images for building damage detection is the most reliable method.

This investigation compared variability in selection of V̇O 2 θ among interpreters with different levels of experience as well as from auto-detection algorithms employed by a commercially available metabolic cart (MC). Ten healthy young men performed three replicates of incremental cycle exercise during which gas exchange measurements were collected breath-by-breath. Two <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreters</b> (E) and four novice interpreters (N) determined V̇O 2 θ from plots of specific response variables. Interpreters noted methods used and confidence in their selections. V̇O 2 θ was automatically determined by the MC. Interclass correlations indicated that E agreed with each other (mean difference, 21 mL·min- 1) and with the MC (23 mL·min- 1), but not with N (- 664 to 364 mL·min- 1); N did not agree among themselves. Despite good overall agreement between E and MC, differences > 500 mL·min- 1 were seen in 50 % of individual cases.

We, therefore, aimed to validate reproducibility of the automated quantification with the TPD on myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images in Japanese patients with history of stable CAD. MethodsPatients (n= 47, age 67 ± 10) underwent rest 201 Tl and stress 99 mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial perfusion SPECT on two separate occasions with the same protocol within 3 – 26 months. They had abnormal findings on the first SPECT imaging by visual analysis and had no changes in symptoms, cardiac medications, coronary risk factors, and electrocardiogram findings {{at the time of}} the second imaging. They had no intervening coronary revascularization and myocardial infarction between the first and second imaging. The TPD was automatically derived from SPECT images through quantitative perfusion SPECT software with the Japanese normal database. A visual summed stress score (SSS) was estimated with the 5 -point visual scoring model for 20 segments of SPECT images by independent expert interpreters. Abnormal criteria for the stress TPD and SSS were defined as ≥ 5 % and ≥ 4, respectively. ResultsThe stress TPD determined by the quantitative analysis well correlated between the first and second imaging (r= 0. 985) as well as the SSS by the visual analysis showed good correlation (r= 0. 978). The correlation coefficients were similar between the visual and quantitative analyses. Bland–Altman analyses indicated extremely good reproducibility in both assessments. ConclusionThe TPD is evidently a quantitative index having high reproducibility and the automated quantification with it provides comparable results to the visual assessment by <b>experienced</b> <b>interpreters.</b> The automated quantification with the TPD is highly significant for clinical assessment of CAD, and allows easily performing myocardial perfusion SPECT imaging without expert interpreters...|$|R
