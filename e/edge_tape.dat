5000|$|The {{design is}} made from high-tenacity, low-porosity {{material}} of 49 g/m2 and incorporates diagonal tapes instead of the more commonly used whole diagonal ribs. The tapes form triangles, in conjunction with reinforcement tapes on the bottom surface of the glider wing and prevent airfoil deformation. The wing also is constructed with a trailing <b>edge</b> <b>tape</b> that extends across the complete wing's span. This tape reduces canopy oscillations and stiffens the wing in flight. Small intermediate 30 to 40 cm ribs are also sewn into the wing's trailing edge to improve stability. The wing also has [...] "safety cells" [...] of line attachment tapes that extend to the wing top surface, {{reducing the risk of}} [...] "zipper" [...] line failures. These design features result in a wing that provides good performance with high stability.|$|E

Tests examining the sealing characteristics of foam rubber <b>edge</b> <b>tape</b> found equally satisfactory performance when used with phenol-faced HMR particleboard as with faced formply. Weathering of faced and unfaced HMR board and of faced formply was studied using two sets of exposure tests of 5 months and of 2 months duration. The timber frames supporting the boards employed different joist and nail spacings.

40|$|Fatigue damage {{calculations}} {{are conducted}} as state-of-art design process for wind turbines. Fatigue analysis is performed on spar caps and trailing <b>edge</b> <b>tape</b> (UD material) considering uni-axial stress state. The main {{objective of the}} research project is to analyze the effect of various parameters like yaw errors, wind turbine design load cases and blade mass imbalances on fatigue damage of blade. Also, an overall structural study of the blade has been performed based on the guidelines of International Electro-technical Commission (IEC) 61400 - 1 Ed. 3 to understand the structural robustness of blade in terms of stiffness and strength. Loads based on an onshore site have been generated using aero-(servo) -elastic code, Fatigue Aerodynamics Structural and Turbulence (FAST). Based on these loads and predominantly linear Finite Element Model (FEM) calculations on a blade model in ANSYS (except for flapwise loading on spar caps), stress time series are calculated. Finally, using these stress time series, the fatigue damage at different blade sections are calculated in ’Octave’ environment using rain-flow cycle counting method and Miner’s rule. Results show that blade is stiff enough from blade-tower interference and resonance per- spective, but buckling is observed in the trailing edge close to the tip, with flapwise buckling mode coming out as the most critical one. Fatigue is not a structural issue based on state-of- art calculations and design load cases, even in the critical transition region (from circular to DU airfoil along the span of the blade). It was found that positive yaw errors are more detri- mental to fatigue life than negative ones for an anti-clockwise rotating turbine. Trailing <b>edge</b> <b>tape</b> is more affected by blade mass imbalance while spar caps are sensitive to changes in yaw errors in terms of fatigue life. Power production design load case is completely dominating fatigue life when compared to start up and shutdown load cases. All the results that have been presented here {{are based on a}} particular wind site conditions, a specific blade and a wind turbine model. The idea has been to give a qualitative and relative overview of different trends in the structural analysis, rather than coming to a conclusion in an absolute sense. Due to the presence of considerable cone angle, shaft tilt and rotor overhang, blade-tower interference is not an issue for the analyzed blade design. It should be, however, considered to increase the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>tape</b> length towards the tip region to prevent buckling issues. Also, extra core materials could be provided (thus increasing bending stiffness and thickness) to prevent buckling problems. Operation of turbine under other significant loading conditions like icing and heavy leading edge erosion should be incorporated to study fatigue in more detail. Fatigue life should be evaluated and validated with models other than Miner’s sum (for example, residual strength degradation model) along with full blade test (for an existent blade) for precise results. An aero-elastic stability analysis of full wind turbine model should be performed to understand the dynamics of whole system on blades. Finally, fatigue damage in bond lines between different components of blade is also a critical consideration for future work.

40|$|Lateral tape motion (LTM) is {{the motion}} of a tape {{perpendicular}} to the tape transport direction. It {{is a problem in}} magnetic tape recording technology that limits the track density on a tape. To reduce LTM, it is important to characterize the main sources of LTM in tape transports. In this dissertation, the effect of <b>tape</b> <b>edge</b> contact as well as tape tension transients on LTM is investigated. An optical non-contact tension sensor is developed and a correlation between LTM and tension transients is observed. Additionally, a method based on acoustic emission is established to measure <b>tape</b> <b>edge</b> contact. <b>Tape</b> <b>edge</b> contact is observed to cause high frequency LTM, and the magnitude of the impact is shown to be function of the tape pack size. The dynamics of a tape as it moves over a cylindrical guide are studied theoretically and validated experimentally. Good agreement between theory and experiments is observed. In the experimental analysis, the tape/guide friction coefficient is observed to be function of different operating and design parameters. A model for the friction coefficient between a tape and a cylindrical guide is presented and evaluated with experimental data. Finally, the use of laser surface texturing (LST) for improved tape guiding is proposed and investigated both experimentally and numerically. LST guides are observed to create an air bearing at low tape speeds and thus reduce the transition speed between boundary lubrication and full fluid lubrication. Additionally, the design of a dual stage actuator tape head for increased bandwidth track-following is introduced, as a means to enable increased track density on a tape for future high performance tape drive...|$|R
