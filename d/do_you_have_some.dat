However, there is a way that farmers can get energy from livestock manure and still use it {{as a source of}} fertility on their fields. When manure decomposes it releases a natural gas ? a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide ? which makes an excellent and clean fuel for cooking and lighting. In India and China this ?biogas? is used by millions of small farms, helping to improve farm sanitation as well as providing a low cost source of energy. In Africa, Uganda is leading the way in the adoption of biogas. Even here, however, it is still quite rare. Wambi Michael recently travelled to Mukono district to meet Ruth Musoke, one of Uganda?s biogas pioneers. IN:	?Madam Musoke, you are one ? OUT:	? delay the less fire you get. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 23 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Ruth Musoke, one of Uganda?s biogas pioneers, talking to Wambi Michael. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Michael	Madam Musoke, {{you are one of the}} few farmers within Mukono who are using a biogas digester. How did you learn about the biogas digesters? Musoke	We have a friend called Pastor Kakembo, he came and visited our place, he suggested to us that we can install a biogas system at our place because we had cows and he had the same system at his place. So we went to his place and we admired the system. So he is the one who gave us the technical person who did the work for us. Michael	When did this begin? Musoke	That was almost 8 years back. Michael	And has it been working throughout 8 years now? Musoke	Yes, very successfully. We normally use it for cooking and lighting. We get light from biogas and then fire. Michael	So let?s go back to where the process begins. I can see this hole here, what is it for? Musoke	This one is for the collection of urine from the main building where the cows stay throughout the day, but it was not enough, the urine was a lot so we had to construct another pit where the urine collects up. And that one it is more comfortable because it is where we do the mixing. Michael	How do you mix the cow dung into the digester? Musoke	At that system, there are two bowls which are prepared for the mixture. So we get urine from the pit and then we collect cow dung from the place where we keep the animals, and then we mix it up, pour it in the main digester. That is how it is done. Michael	We have heard reports that you need 19 kgs of cow dung daily to feed a digester. Where do you get the 19 kgs of cow dung? Musoke	Me, I have almost 9 animals and I normally use 2 wheelbarrows of cow dung to get the biogas I need for my home consumption. Michael	<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> excess of cow dung which you don?t use because you have many animals? Musoke	Yes, I have a lot of it. Because what I have, I can?t mix it up on a daily basis. We collect cow dung in the morning and in the evening. So we have a reserve pit again, where we keep this cow dung, the one which is not used up for biogas system, and it is normally taken up by those farmers and other people who have the system and don?t have access to cow dung. Michael	Can we go to the fireplace and see how it works? Musoke	Yes. Michael	In most times when you come to a kitchen like this in rural areas in Uganda, you see a lot of soot, but I can see here it?s very clean. Musoke	Yes and it?s because I?m using fire from biogas. Michael	Because normally entering such a kitchen would mean that maybe we would see some tears coming out of you! Musoke	I don?t think it?s so clean, but that?s how it is. Michael	OK. I see very clean fire coming out of the gas plate. Where is the fire coming from? Musoke	It is coming through the other pipe and these are the switches. Michael	Which means you can cook two saucepans of food on this same gas plate? Musoke	Yes, according to your plates. It can go up to three or four, it depends on what you want. Michael	So can you switch it back on? So how long does it take to boil such water? Musoke	It depends on the amount which you want, because now it is at the maximum. You can reduce, depending on the type of fire you want and on what you are cooking. Michael	How clean is the biogas? Musoke	Whatever you prepare is so clean, even the saucepan, they don?t get stained. Blue flames only, which doesn?t stain. And the maintenance is so low, just to repair the other plate, because they get stained. That thing is done in Katwe. Michael	Does it rust? Musoke	Yes. For instance you are cooking something, what you are cooking pours on it and then that metal part of it rusts. That is the main problem with it. But I have changed it ever since it was there only two times. Michael	What about the digester, does it require some maintenance? Musoke	Ever since we installed it we have never done any maintenance, but what you need to do, you have to be committed in mixing this. You become so smelly on the day when you do the mixing. That?s why some people don?t want that business. But here it is done, we regularly do it. I do it, my children do it, everyone who is on duty does it. We don?t employ someone to mix for us. Michael	Many Ugandans have heard of the biogas but many fear the installation costs. How much did it cost you to install this system in this farm? Musoke	We used almost 2. 5 million to install the system. Michael	And you think you have reaped some money from the 2. 5 million shillings that you initially invested here? Musoke	A lot, I have saved a lot, because what gets out of the system? They come here, those ones who are doing the business of the gardens and what, they get that waste from me and they give me some money. What matters most is for someone who is using this biogas to be active in mixing. The more you mix the more fire you get, the more you delay the less fire you get.

40|$|Moringa ? {{the miracle}} tree Cue: Every day, an {{estimated}} twenty five thousand people {{in developing countries}} die from water borne diseases. In water treatment plants, the most common purifying chemical used is aluminium salt. This often needs to be imported, making it quite expensive. There could soon be a home-grown solution, however. The Asian moringa tree, originally from India but now found in much of Africa, has seeds which contain a natural coagulant. This can bind impurities, cleaning water and making it safe to drink. Moringa also has many other useful properties. It contains high levels of iron, calcium and Vitamin A, and is used to boost the immune system, as well as treating {{a wide range of}} illnesses. Dr Stanley Hamalilo of the National Institute for Natural Plant Products promotes medicinal plants such as moringa in central and southern Zambia. Chris Kakunta visited his farm, 100 kilometres northwest of Lusaka, {{to find out more about}} this plant which some call the miracle tree. IN:		?Well, when we are talking about ? OUT:		? at the end of the day. ? DUR?N:	 5 ? 20 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Stanley Hamalilo describing the many benefits of the moringa tree. The interview comes from a radio pack produced by CTA. Transcript Hamalilo	Well, when we are talking about moringa, it has actually been proved that moringa is one of the powerful plants, or trees, which has got very high medicinal properties, and not only on the part of healing. It also contains essential elements like minerals, vitamins, which you cannot find in these other plants. So generally, when you talk about moringa, moringa is like a miracle tree, they way we call it. It?s a miracle tree. Kakunta	Being a miracle tree, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> examples of certain illnesses that it is able to cure? Hamalilo	When you talk about the problems of high blood pressure, diabetes, osteoporosis ? we are talking about the loss of calcium from the bones ? it has actually very high calcium, which you cannot compare in milk. So for bone density building up, it is actually very good. Kakunta	Now you mentioned promoting this particular tree; in what areas are you promoting it? Hamalilo	Well we are promoting on the nutrition part, and as well on the medicinal part. Because when you are talking about the nutrition part, there is a certain programme that we are doing on the HIV programme. Or just let me give a little formula where you get yellow maize or yellow corn, or popcorn. You know popcorn it has got a very high percentage of selenium, which helps to build up the immune system in human beings. If you get about 1 kg of popcorn, 1 kg of finger millet, 2 kg of soya beans, 1 kg of groundnut. You mix all these ingredients together; of course you have to take for milling. When you get the flour then you mix it with 400 grams of moringa powder. Then a patient is told to be getting one cup of this mixture, and in the evening one cup. At the end of the day, you will see how this person is going to build up the immune system. Kakunta	And this has been working out very well? Hamalilo	And this has been actually tremendously working, and powerful results in all the areas that we have introduced this programme. Kakunta	Here at the farm you are also feeding your livestock with moringa branches. Are they nutritious too? Hamalilo	That is the beauty of moringa. As I said in the first place, that this is actually a miracle plant. You see, when you look at all these animals, including even birds. You actually get these leaves of the moringa; then you dry them in the shade. You don?t dry them in the open place. There is a special place that we dry these plants; they have to use a shade drying. Then after they have done that then you bring them, you pulverise them. Which means you pound them. Then after they have been pounded, then actually you can add them to any feed, and give it to animals and birds. And at the end of the day you are going to discover that the birds will actually flourish, and the animals also will flourish, and they will have less infectious diseases because of the system which is so powerful. Kakunta	In terms of encouraging the small-scale farmers to grow this particular plant, do you have programmes on the ground? Hamalilo	We are working in collaboration with the ministry of agriculture and co-operatives department. So we are actually going to train the members of the co-operatives how actually to grow this plant, how to process it and how to use it at the end of the day. Kakunta	Wonderful. Now, what type of materials do you use for planting it? Hamalilo	Well we just use the stem. You can just cut the stem and then plant it directly. It is a very cheap kind of a thing. It is very easy. Within a short time, maybe within two years, you will have a very big forest of moringa. Then the other method is seed. You actually put in the seedling sacks, and then wait for them to germinate. When they germinate you can actually go around and plant them around your farm or any other place that you would like these plants to be. Kakunta	Here at your farm I have seen quite a number of moringa trees. Are you also using them for other purposes, other than the medicine? Hamalilo	Yes, yes. We are using them for animals, as I said, we are using them for the chickens. And we are using them also for water purification, we are using the seed. So you just have to pulverise the seed of moringa, and then you add it in the water that you want to drink, and then within 10 - 20 minutes time that water is purified, you can use it. And also for fertilising the fields. So we can chop some seeds or flowers or the leaves together, and then after you have done that you can actually put them in the growing pots, and then you put your flowers there. The flowers they shoot up nicely. Kakunta	This tree is relatively new here in Zambia. To what extent do you think that through your programme this tree will be able to be adopted by many small-scale farmers? Hamalilo	Well we have actually seen already that the movement is very nice, and people have started to appreciate the plant, because those who have already used it, they are actually spreading the information to others. We believe that with the help of the government and other stakeholders and other NGOs who are interested to come up with this kind of programme. Especially to alleviate the problem of poverty. Because I believe the coming of moringa is one way of reducing the impact of poverty in the lives of people. As they have animals, they will feed them, the animals, they will sell them, they will have money, at the end of the day. End of track.

At the same time, the University was facing a {{significant}} problem: increasing enrollment because of soldiers returning from World War II {{who were interested in}} higher education. Briggs was tasked with expanding the facilities of the University in order to handle the increase in enrollment. He {{played an important role in}} securing married student housing at the nearby Willow Run Airport. University administrators did not believe that the University was prepared for the amount of food that would be brought in for the dorms, so Briggs worked to raise funds for the eventual food service building. Robert Briggs was also critical in financing the building of key University of Michigan facilities such as Alice Lloyd Hall, South Quadrangle, the School of Business Administration, and the Administration Building, as well as acquiring land that would become the University of Michigan's North Campus. He reviewed different available land options the University could purchase, and settled on the site of what is now North Campus. Many within the University thought present day North Campus was too far to be a part of the University, however Briggs argued that it was the best location because it would allow for the most expansion, and with this expansion came the realization that the physical and architectural face of the University was changing.
