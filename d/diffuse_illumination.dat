40|$|Frustrated Total Internal Reflection (FTIR) {{is a key}} {{technology}} {{for the design of}} multi-touch systems. With respect to other solutions, such as <b>Diffused</b> <b>Illumination</b> (DI) and <b>Diffused</b> Surface <b>Illumination</b> (DSI), FTIR based sensors suffer less from ambient IR noise, and is, thus, more robust to variable lighting conditions. However, FTIR does not provide (or is weak on) some desirable features, such as finger proximity and tracking quick gestures. This paper presents an improvement for FTIR based multi-touch sensing that partly addresses the above issues exploiting the shadows projected on the surface by the hands {{to improve the quality of}} the tracking system. The proposed solution exploits natural uncontrolled light to improve the tracking algorithm: it takes advantage of the natural IR noise to aid tracking, thus turning one of the main issues of MT sensors into a useful quality, making it possible to implement pre-contact feedback and enhance tracking precision...|$|R

50|$|Cube maps can {{be useful}} for {{modelling}} outdoor illumination accurately. Simply modelling sunlight as a single infinite light oversimplifies outdoor illumination and results in unrealistic lighting. Although plenty of light does come from the sun, the scattering of rays in the atmosphere causes the whole sky {{to act as a}} light source (often referred to as skylight illumination). However, by using a cube map the diffuse contribution from skylight illumination can be captured. Unlike environment maps where the reflection vector is used, this method accesses the cube map based on the surface normal vector to provide a fast approximation of the <b>diffuse</b> <b>illumination</b> from the skylight. The one downside to this method is that computing cube maps to properly represent a skylight is very complex; one recent process is computing the spherical harmonic basis that best represents the low frequency <b>diffuse</b> <b>illumination</b> from the cube map. However, a considerable amount of research has been done to effectively model skylight illumination.|$|E

5000|$|Paper texture limits {{what can}} be done with the calotype process. This texture can be seen by holding a piece of copier paper up to the light: the way fibers clump in the paper making process causes a {{relatively}} low contrast pattern that may remind one of bushes growing on a hillside. [...] This pattern persists when paper is waxed, as similarly examining a piece of commercial waxed paper used for wrapping food will show. Since the contrast in the pattern is low, it does not interfere with tracing a drawing if the paper is thin enough for dark lines to show through. But it is very effective at obscuring low contrast patterns and textures and making them invisible. Consequently, calotype photographs can show bold outlines and high-contrast details clearly, but low-contrast details and textures tend to be lost because of non-uniform paper transmittance. Paper texture effects are limiting in nature photography, for example, where one expects to capture subtle patterns such as those produced by plants growing in close proximity or pebbles in a streambed. Early calotype photographers appear to have dealt with texture by composing with an eye for high contrasts and bold outlines. However, they sometimes resorted to inking in the sky areas of their negatives to eliminate distracting mottling. [...] Information given in various works where calotype images are reproduced indicates that negative sizes of 20 x 25 cm (8 x 10 in) or greater were not unusual. [...] This seems practical for a professional who planned to profit from the sale of contact prints that would be {{the same size as the}} original negative, but less so for an amateur because of the large amounts of silver nitrate required. The way paper texture effects become relatively more pronounced as negative size decreases can be demonstrated with a digital camera by photographing a sheet of paper lit from behind, first at a distance where the sheet just overfills the field of view, and then at a closer distance where the field of view is perhaps one third as wide. (A stack of the same paper will appear much more uniform if it is viewed by reflected light with <b>diffuse</b> <b>illumination.)</b> Anyone who wishes to make calotypes today should expect that otherwise successful negatives will suffer in comparison to the best surviving early work if a relatively small format such as 10 x 10 cm (4 x 4 in) is used. Despite the use of large formats and careful paper selection, continuing dissatisfaction with paper stimulated the invention of the collodion on glass process (see Collodion process) that quickly displaced calotypes after 1851, even though paper was the easier medium to work with.|$|E

It is planned, that the lighting acquisition data is based upon real data allocated from light manufacturers (Eulumdat-Formate/IES-Formate). The data has to be converted into an adapted form (textures) {{that can be used}} within the rendering system. The acquisition of the material-characterization is planned to be based upon photographs from real materials. Thereby have to be taken pictures in different lighting situations. That picture-sequence needs to be converted into an adapted form (3 d-textures) that can be used within the rendering system. The acquisition and postprocessing steps should be automated if possible. The Fraunhofer Institut für Graphische Datenverarbeitung (IGD) develops a software system that allows interactive light simulation. Interactive movement of scene objects and highly realistic simulation in real-time should be displayed. The purpose is to generate images, not to visualize numeric values of luminance intensity onto a raster, which is not intuitive for the user. A photorealistic image to work with is highly appreciated. A method to generate high quality images in real-time is PRT (Precomputed Radiance Transfer). The advantage of PRT to other real-time rendering methods as OpenGL is the simulation of soft shadows in real-time because of flat, homogenously illuminating surface light sources.

40|$|We {{introduce}} image-space radiosity and {{a hierarchical}} variant {{as a method}} for interactively approximating <b>diffuse</b> indirect <b>illumination</b> in fully dynamic scenes. As oft observed, <b>diffuse</b> indirect <b>illumination</b> contains mainly low-frequency details {{that do not require}} independent computations at every pixel.

We instead propose clustering computations in image space, allowing the use of cheap hardware mipmapping and implicit quadtrees to allow coarser illumination computations. We build on a recently introduced multiresolution splatting technique combined with an image-space lightcut algorithm to intelligently choose virtual point lights for an interactive, one-bounce instant radiosity solution. Intelligently selecting point lights from our reflective shadow map enables temporally coherent illumination similar to results using more than 4096 regularly-sampled VPLs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Multi-touch {{interaction}} with computationally enhanced surfaces has received considerable attention in recent years. Hardware implementations of multi-touch interaction such as Frustrated Total Internal Reflection (FTIR) and <b>Diffused</b> <b>Illumination</b> (DI) have {{allowed for the}} low cost development of surfaces. Although many of these technologies and associated applications have been presented in aca-demic settings, the practicalities of building a high quality multi-touch enabled surface, {{both in terms of}} the software and hardware required, are not widely known. We draw upon our extensive experience as developers of multi-touch technology to provide practical advice in relation to building, and deploying applications upon, multi-touch surfaces.

40|$|Light {{propagation}} volumes is a real-time single bounce {{indirect lighting}} approximation that uses spherical harmonics for light representation and a grid-based light transport. The technique {{is useful for}} applying indirect light to participating media, glossy specular reflection, and indirect <b>diffuse</b> <b>illumination,</b> but this thesis focuses on the indirect <b>diffuse</b> <b>illumination.</b> When applying indirect diffuse light, the light propagation volume method has issues with light bleeding, self lighting, and surface lighting artifacts. Also, when the indirect diffuse lighting is applied to more complex geometry, {{there is a lack}} of directional influence in the shading, producing a flat lighting effect, uncharacteristic of diffuse shading. I modify the light propagation volume approach by extending the spherical harmonics from two bands to three bands and describe a higher order propagation approach that considers 26 directions of propagation versus the original six. The new resulting technique is called higher order light propagation volumes. Higher order light propagation volumes are able to combat some of the problems present with light propagation volumes. The new technique reduces the appearance of lighting artifacts, and at the same time promotes a light distribution in scenes that resembles reference implementations, such as path tracing. Lastly, indirect <b>diffuse</b> <b>illumination</b> applied with the new technique produces higher quality diffuse shading detail because the directional representation of light is better preserved with the combination of extended spherical harmonics light representation and the higher order propagation metho...|$|E

Physi-cally correct, noise-free images can require {{hundreds or thousands}} of ray samples per pixel, and {{take a long time to}} compute. Recent approaches have exploited sparse sampling and filtering; the filtering is either fast (axis-aligned), but requires more input samples, or needs fewer input samples but is very slow (sheared). We present a new approach for fast sheared filtering on the GPU. Our algorithm factors the 4 D sheared filter into four 1 D filters. We derive complexity bounds for our method, showing that the per-pixel complexity is reduced from O(n 2 l 2) to O(nl), where n is the linear filter width (filter size isO(n 2)) and l is the (usually very small) number of sam-ples for each dimension of the light or lens per pixel (spp is l 2). We thus reduce sheared filtering overhead dramatically. We demonstrate rendering of depth of field, soft shadows and <b>diffuse</b> global <b>illumination</b> at interactive speeds.
