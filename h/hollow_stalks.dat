60|$|By {{the end of}} November the thistles {{would be}} dead, and their huge <b>hollow</b> <b>stalks</b> as dry and light as the shaft of a bird's feather--a feather-shaft twice as big round as a broomstick and six to eight feet long.

The thistle dead was just as great a nuisance as the thistle living, and in this dead dry condition they would sometimes stand all through December and January when the days were hottest and the danger of fire was ever present to people's minds. At any moment a careless spark from a cigarette might kindle a dangerous blaze. At such times the sight of smoke in the distance would cause every man who saw it to mount his horse and fly to the danger-spot, where an attempt would be made to stop the fire by making a broad path in the thistles some fifty to a hundred yards ahead of it. One way to make the path was to lasso and kill a few sheep from the nearest flock and drag them up and down at a gallop through the dense thistles until a broad space was clear where the flames could be stamped and beaten out with horse-rugs. But sheep to be used in this way were not always to be found on the spot, and even when a broad space could be made, if a hot north wind was blowing it would carry showers of sparks and burning sticks to the other side and the fire would travel on.|$|E

When diluted the scent of galbanum has variously been described as reminiscent of pine (due to the pinene and limonene content), evergreen, green bamboo, parsley, green apples, musk, or simply intense green. The oil has a pine like topnote which is less pronounced in the odor of the resinoid. The latter, in turn, has a more woody balsamic, conifer resinous character. Galbanum is frequently adulterated with pine oil.|$|E

60|$|A curious {{instance}} of intelligence in a cat {{was brought to}} my notice at this time by one of my neighbours, a native.

Smelling her prey, she would spring {{at one end of}} the stalk--the end towards which the mouse would be moving at the same time, but would catch nothing, for the mouse, instead of running out, would turn back to run to the other end; whereupon the cat, all excitement, would jump there to seize it; and so the contest would continue for a long time, an exhibition of the cleverness and the stupidity of instinct, both of the pursuer and the pursued. There were several cats at the house, and all acted in the same way except one. When a stalk was placed before this cat, instead of becoming excited like the others, it went quickly to one end and smelt' at the opening, then, satisfied that its prey was inside, it deliberately bit a long piece out of the stalk with its teeth, then another strip, and so on progressively, until the entire stick had been opened up to within six or eight inches of the further end, when the mouse came out and was caught. Every stalk placed before this cat was demolished in the same businesslike way; but the other cats, though they were made to look on while the stick was being broken up by their fellow, could never learn the trick.|$|R

(2) Spermatophore carrying adults are donors, their spermatophores being freshly made and on offer to a potential mate.

Entobdellines from southern Queensland differed morphologically from those from northern Queensland and Taiwan and the 2 new monogenean species are described and named Neoentobdella garneri sp. nov. and N. taiwanensis sp. nov., respectively. We determined that an entobdelline collected by Dyer and co-workers from a ray identified as T. melanospila (= T. meyeni) from an aquarium in Okinawa, Japan and identified by them as Entobdella squamula (Heath, 1902) Johnston, 1929 was misidentified and is tentatively assigned to N. taiwanensis sp. nov.

Caution is advised in deciding whether the male copulatory organs of capsalids may function as a penis or as a cirrus and we suggest that possession of a penis versus a cirrus may not necessarily indicate wide evolutionary divergence.
