A cell, in {{a cellular}} communication network, comprising an admission means (AC) able, when an <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> requests to be hosted, to make a decision by selecting among: - accepting said <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> in normal mode (NM), - rejecting (RE) said <b>incoming</b> <b>call,</b> - accepting said <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> in silent mode (SM) : servicing all signalling aspects of said <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> while suspending data traffic of said <b>incoming</b> <b>call.</b> A method, in a cellular communication network for avoiding a call drop...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Virtual {{connection}} tree (VCT) is {{a network}} architecture that can upgrade the quality-of-service (QoS) in wireless {{asynchronous transfer mode}} (ATM) network. The call admission control (CAC) limits the <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> into the network {{in order to maintain}} the quality-of-service of the on going calls, which are already connected to the network. In this paper two different types of systems using VCT are compared, one with queue for new <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> and the other without the queue of the new <b>incoming</b> <b>calls.</b> Both of the systems use prioritizing scheme of handoff calls. There will be some delay of the new <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> when using system with queue. The probability of delay and the handoff dropping probability of the systems will be analyzed...|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 2, the JRRM module {{contains}} the JCAC algorithm. An MT {{wanting to make}} a call (initiate a session) sends a service request to the JRRM module. The JCAC algorithm in JRRM module then selects for the <b>incoming</b> <b>call,</b> a set of T RATs (0 [*]≤[*]T[*]≤[*]J) from the available RATs in the heterogeneous network, where T is the number of RATs selected. T[*]=[*] 0 implies that the <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> cannot be admitted into the heterogeneous network. Therefore, the call is blocked or dropped. T[*]=[*] 1 implies that the <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> can be admitted into just one of the available RATs. Hence, there is no layer splitting. T[*]>[*] 1 implies that the <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> is scalable and it will be admitted into more than one RAT.|$|R
