5|$|The {{carcinogenity}} of chromate dust {{has been}} known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company. Three mechanisms have been proposed to describe the <b>genotoxicity</b> of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly reactive hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the <b>genotoxicity</b> to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.|$|E

25|$|A {{subacute}} rodent NOAEL of 43 μg/kg {{body weight}} {{as well as}} <b>genotoxicity</b> studies were primarily the cause for setting limits for patulin exposure, although a range {{of other types of}} toxicity also exist.|$|E
25|$|Inhibition of DNA repair {{processes}} {{is considered}} one of main mechanism of inorganic arsenic <b>genotoxicity.</b> Nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) are the processes implicated in the repair of DNA base damage induced by ROS after arsenic exposure. In particular, the NER mechanism is the major pathway for repairing bulky distortions in DNA double helix, while the BER mechanism is mainly implicated in the repair of single strand breaks induced by ROS, but inorganic arsenic could also repress the BER mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Reviews {{have found}} no {{association}} between aspartame and cancer. These reviews have looked at numerous carcinogenicity studies in animals, epidemiologic studies in humans, {{as well as in}} vitro <b>genotoxicity</b> studies. These studies {{have found no}} significant evidence that aspartame causes cancer in animals, damages the genome, or causes cancer in humans at doses currently used. This position is supported by multiple regulatory agencies like the FDA and EFSA as well as scientific bodies such as the National Cancer Institute. Aspartame did not show any DNA-damaging properties either.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{investigations}} {{indicate that}} anthracene is noncarcinogenic: [...] "consistently negative findings in numerous in vitro and in vivo <b>genotoxicity</b> tests." [...] Early experiments suggested otherwise because crude samples were contaminated with other polycyclic aromatic compounds. [...] Furthermore, it is readily biodegraded in soil. [...] It is especially susceptible to degradation {{in the presence}} of light.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Genotoxicity</b> {{involves}} {{inhibition of}} DNA repair and DNA methylation. [...] The carcinogenic effect of arsenic {{arises from the}} oxidative stress induced by arsenic. [...] Arsenic's high toxicity naturally {{led to the development}} of a variety of arsenic compounds as chemical weapons, e.g. dimethylarsenic chloride. Some were employed as chemical warfare agents, especially in World War I. [...] This threat led to many studies on antidotes and an expanded knowledge of the interaction of arsenic compounds with living organisms. [...] One result was the development of antidotes such as British anti-Lewisite. [...] Many such antidotes exploit the affinity of As(III) for thiolate ligands, which convert highly toxic organoarsenicals to less toxic derivatives. It is generally assumed that arsenates bind to cysteine residues in proteins.|$|E
2500|$|Cytocidal {{infections are}} often {{associated}} with changes in cell morphology, physiology and are thus important for the complete viral replication and transformation. [...] Cytopathic Effects, often include a change in cell's morphology such as fusion with adjacent cells to form polykaryocytes {{as well as the}} synthesis of nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. [...] Physiological changes include the insufficient movement of ions, formation of secondary messengers, and activation of cellular cascades to continue cellular activity. [...] Biochemically, many viruses inhibit the synthesis of host DNA, RNA, proteins directly or even interfere with protein-protein, DNA-protein, RNA-protein interactions at the subcellular level. [...] <b>Genotoxicity</b> involves breaking, fragmenting, or rearranging chromosomes of the host. [...] Lastly, biologic effects include the viruses' ability to affect the activity of antigens and immunologlobulins in the host cell.|$|E
2500|$|Arsenic is {{reported}} to cause DNA modifications such as aneuploidy, micronuclei formation, chromosome abnormality, deletion mutations, sister chromatid exchange and crosslinking of DNA with proteins. It has been demonstrated that arsenic does not directly interact with DNA and it is considered a poor mutagen, but instead, it helps mutagenicity of other carcinogens. For instance, a synergistic increase in the mutagenic activity of arsenic with UV light has been observed in human and other mammalian cells after exposing the UV-treated cells to arsenic. A series of experimental observations suggest that the arsenic <b>genotoxicity</b> is primarily linked to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during its biotransformation. The ROS production is able to generate DNA adducts, DNA strand breaks, crosslinks and chromosomal aberrations. The oxidative damage is caused by modification of DNA nucleobases, in particular 8-oxoguanine (8-OHdG) which leads to G:C to T:A [...] mutations. Inorganic arsenic can also cause DNA strand break even at low concentrations.|$|E
2500|$|The pathway for the {{metabolism}} of benzene {{is complex}} and begins in the liver. [...] Several enzymes are involved. [...] These include cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), quinine oxidoreductase (NQ01), GSH, and myeloperoxidase (MPO). [...] CYP2E1 is involved at multiple steps: converting benzene to oxepin (benzene oxide), phenol to hydroquinone, and hydroquinone to both benzenetriol and catechol. [...] Hydroquinone, benzenetriol and catechol are converted to polyphenols. [...] In the bone marrow, MPO converts these polyphenols to benzoquinones. [...] These intermediates and metabolites induce <b>genotoxicity</b> by multiple mechanisms including inhibition of topoisomerase II (which maintains chromosome structure), disruption of microtubules (which maintains cellular structure and organization), generation of oxygen free radicals (unstable species) {{that may lead to}} point mutations, increasing oxidative stress, inducing DNA strand breaks, and altering DNA methylation (which can affect gene expression). [...] NQ01 and GSH shift metabolism away from toxicity. [...] NQ01 metabolizes benzoquinone toward polyphenols (counteracting the effect of MPO). [...] GSH is involved with the formation of phenylmercapturic acid.|$|E
2500|$|The {{choice of}} a viral vector to deliver genetic {{material}} to cells comes with some logistical problems. There are {{a limited number of}} viral vectors available for therapeutic use. [...] Any of these few viral vectors can cause the body to develop an immune response if the vector is seen as a foreign invader. Once used, the viral vector cannot be effectively used in the patient again because it will be recognized by the body. If the vaccine or gene therapy fails in clinical trials, the virus can’t be used again in the patient for a different vaccine or gene therapy in the future. Pre-existing immunity against the viral vector could also be present in the patient rendering the therapy ineffective for that patient. It is possible to counteract pre-existing immunity when using a viral vector for vaccination by priming with a non-viral DNA vaccine, but this method presents another expense and obstacle in the vaccine distribution process. Pre-existing immunity may also be challenged by increasing vaccine dose or changing the vaccination route. Some shortcomings of viral vectors (such as <b>genotoxicity</b> and low transgenic expression) can be overcome through the use of [...] hybrid vectors.|$|E

[...] Similarly, ROS have been implicated in <b>genotoxicity</b> caused by particles and fibers. <b>Genotoxicity</b> of nonfibrous and fibrous particles is characterized by high production of ROS from inflammatory cells.|$|E
