40|$|Title: Solutions of the {{offensive}} futsal combinations Objectives: The main {{aim of this}} thesis is to analyse and illustrate the solutions of {{the offensive}} combinations as considered {{through the lens of}} the match process. Methods: The data were collected via the nonparticipating observations of the video recordings of the AC Sparta Praha matches. Categorial system of observation to compare the particular components of the match was employed in order to lay down the correctness of the hypotheses. The resulting values were statistically processed based on the written data. The commentary <b>files</b> <b>were</b> <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> via dashing and writing notes. Results: Through the observations, the combinations leading to scoring the goal were found, and the key aspects of the successful executions were laid out. More possible variants of executing the offense were found. The higher success rate was found when combining the gradual offense, quick counter-offense after gaining the ball, end-play executed from the centre of the field and also against the defence active in the defender's half of the field. Keywords: game performance, offensive combinations, game situations, analysis, training proce...|$|R

30|$|The {{essence of}} hot deck {{imputation}} is that missing {{data in a}} recipient <b>file</b> (TALIS) <b>are</b> <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> with actual values from a donor data file (PISA) based on a pre‐specified algorithm. This approach requires that the donor data set {{be at least as}} large or larger than the recipient data set. Once a PISA donor is found for a TALIS recipient, the missing data for the TALIS recipient is given the value of the PISA donor. The resulting synthetic data set has a sample size equivalent to that of the original TALIS sample. A number of algorithms exist for hot deck matching, however for this paper we will focus our attention only on nearest neighbor hot deck matching. For our analyses, will use the R program StatMatch (D’Orazio 2011) for non‐parametric hot deck matching.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Child {{abuse is}} often unrecognized at out-of-hours primary care (OOH-PC) services. The aim {{of our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the clinical outcome of the screening instrument SPUTOVAMO-R 2 for child abuse (checklist), followed by a structured approach (reporting code), at OOH-PC services. The reporting code with five steps should ensure consistent action {{in case of a}} suspicion. METHODS: All children attending one of the five participating OOH-PC services in the region of Utrecht, the Netherlands, in a year time, were included. The checklist is an obligatory field in the electronic patient <b>file</b> and <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> for all children. In case of a positive checklist, the steps in the reporting code were followed. Additionally, the case was evaluated in a multidisciplinary team to determine the probability of child abuse. RESULTS: The checklist <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> <b>in</b> for 50671 children; 108 (0. 2  %) were positive. The multidisciplinary team diagnosed child abuse in 24 (22  %) of the 108 positive checklists, and no child abuse in 36 (33  %). Emotional neglect was the most frequent type of abuse diagnosed. For all abused children, care was implemented according to the protocol. The most frequent care given was a referral to the hospital (N[*]=[*] 7) or contact with child's own general practitioner (N[*]=[*] 6). CONCLUSION: A checklist followed by a reporting code guarantees consistent actions and care for children with a suspicion of child abuse. The percentage of positive checklists is lower than expected. Validity of the checklist should be assessed in a diagnostic study...|$|R
