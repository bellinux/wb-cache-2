5|$|<b>Fried</b> chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern <b>fried</b> chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep <b>fried,</b> or pressure <b>fried.</b> The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates <b>fried</b> chicken from other <b>fried</b> forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made <b>fried</b> chicken.|$|E

5|$|The first dish {{known to}} have been deep <b>fried</b> was fritters, which were popular in the Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of {{seasoned}} <b>fried</b> chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Prior to the Second World War, <b>fried</b> chicken was often very expensive and was only enjoyed on special occasions. In the late 1900s and early 2000s, however, <b>fried</b> chicken has been mass-produced and the price of the dish has gone down significantly.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{industrial}} <b>frying</b> {{systems are}} not optimised towards homogeneous product quality, which is partly related to poor oil distribution across the packed bed of <b>fries.</b> In this study we investigate an alternative <b>frying</b> system with an oil cross-flow from bottom to top through a packed bed of <b>fries.</b> Fluidization of rectangular <b>fries</b> during <b>frying</b> was characterised with a modified Ergun equation. Mixing was visualized by using two coloured layers of <b>fries</b> and quantified in terms of mixing entropy. Smaller <b>fries</b> mixed quickly during <b>frying,</b> while longer <b>fries</b> exhibited much less mixing, which was attributed to the higher minimum fluidization velocity and slower dehydration for longer <b>fries.</b> The cross-flow velocity was found an important parameter for the homogeneity of the moisture content of <b>fries.</b> Increased oil velocities positively affected moisture distribution due to a higher oil refresh rate. However, inducing fluidization caused the moisture distribution to become unpredictable due to bed instabilities. </p...|$|R

Chinese migrants introduced a number of dishes that have become part of urban popular cuisine in regions with large Chinese communities, including riz cantonais (Chinese <b>fried</b> rice), soupe chinoise (Chinese-style noodle soup), misao (<b>fried</b> noodles), pao (hum bao) and nems (<b>fried</b> egg rolls).|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{repeated}} deep <b>frying</b> of potatoes versus repeated heating/quenching on the chemical profile of palm oil was investigated. The novelty {{of the work}} is that the <b>frying</b> and heating/quenching experiments were conducted under similar time-temperature profiles. The effects of the <b>frying</b> load (potato-to-oil ratio: 1 / 7 and 1 / 35 kgpotatoes/loil) and of the time-temperature profile were examined. Whole palm oil and its polar fraction were analyzed using high pressure size exclusion chromatography. Both repeated <b>frying</b> and repeated heating/quenching generated polar and polymerization products in palm oil. Interestingly, no hydrolysis or other decomposition products were generated under any of the examined conditions. The presence of potatoes during <b>frying</b> in palm oil increased the concentration of polymerization products and polar compounds compared to oils without potatoes significantly. The effects of <b>frying</b> load on oil quality depended on <b>frying</b> time. No significant effect of <b>frying</b> load was observed up to <b>frying</b> times of 13 h (or 10 <b>frying</b> batches). However, <b>frying</b> oil quality was affected by <b>frying</b> load once <b>frying</b> times exceeded 24 h (or 20 batches) ...|$|R
