Kohl, Todd Spencer and Tyler Osborn {{from the}} School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering {{presented}} a lecture at the Nano@Tech Meeting on September 9, 2008 at 12 noon in room 102 of the MiRC building. Runtime: 61 : 09 minutesThe "off-chip" bandwidth {{is a major}} bottleneck causing system delays and limited throughput, especially {{in areas such as}} processor-to-memory bandwidth and processor-to-network. The ITRS cites off-chip signal bandwidth exceeding 60 GHz within 10 years. Organic substrates (i. e. chip packages or interposers) with flip-chip solder connections are the core of the first and second level of interconnect. Off-chip bandwidth is limited to several GHz due to frequency dependent attenuation, signal reflections, and crosstalk within the polymer dielectric, via structures, and I/O signal path transitions within the chip substrate and mother board. In this work, we have introduced advances in off-chip interconnect using air-isolated, <b>coaxial</b> <b>links</b> on substrates and boards to demonstrate ultra high-speed chip-to-chip and chip-to-network communications.

Using such cables, no repeater amplifier is necessary to obtain a reasonable dynamic range [1]. From this point of view, the use of optical fibres is necessary for link lengths > 1. 4 km.

40|$|The {{reverse current}} tends {{to occur in}} the {{transition}} region of the guiding magnetic field in a magnetically <b>insulated</b> <b>coaxial</b> diode (MICD). Influence of the guiding magnetic field on characteristics of the MICD especially on the reverse current is studied by the particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation in this paper. The reverse current is confirmed to be irrelevant with the guiding magnetic field strength. However, the reverse current is clarified quantitatively to depend on the electric and magnetic field distribution in the upstream of the cathode tip. As the MICD has been widely employed in microwave tubes, a simple approach to suppress the reverse current on the premise of little change of the original diode is valuable and thus proposed. The optimum matching point between the cathode and the magnetic field is selected in consideration of the entrance depth tolerance, the diode impedance discrepancy and the reverse current coefficient...|$|R

50|$|Before {{utilizing}} microwave relay and coaxial cables, AT&T used {{lines for}} long distance service. In 1911, the system connected New York to Denver. The introduction of repeater towers allowed such connections to reach across North America. In the 1930s the company experimented with long-distance coaxial cable. The first long-distance L-carrier <b>coaxial</b> <b>link</b> in 1936 connected Philadelphia and New York City.

AT&T used the <b>coaxial</b> <b>link</b> to transmit the Republican National Convention in June 1940 from Philadelphia to New York City, {{where it was}} televised to a few hundred receivers over the NBC station W2XBS (which evolved into WNBC) as well as seen in Schenectady, New York via W2XB (which evolved into WRGB) via off-air relay from the New York station.|$|R
40|$|The tether and/or {{transmission}} line connecting the SP- 100 to space station presents some unorthodox challenges in high voltage engineering, power transmission, and distribution. The line, which {{doubles as a}} structural element of this unusual spacecraft, will convey HVDC from SP- 100 to the platform in low Earth orbit, and environment where the local plasma is sufficient to cause breakdown of exposed conductors at potentials {{of only a few}} hundred volts. Its anticipated several years operation, and continuously accumulating exposure to meteoroids and debris, raises an increasing likelihood that mechanical damage, including perforation, will be sustained in service.

Practical considerations of launch, deployment and assembly have lead to investigation of reel deployable, dielectric <b>insulated</b> <b>coaxial</b> cables.

A 40 kV, crosslinked polyethylene (XLPE) <b>insulated</b> <b>coaxial</b> cable was used as a model power cable. Sample lengths were immersed in a potassium chloride solution and some of these were subjected to AC electrical stress. After an 8 week duration, a high density of tress was found in the electrically stressed cable. Dielectric spectra have been measured for both sample types in the frequency range of 10 - 5 to 105 Hz. Insertion loss measurements were also carried out in the frequency range of 3 × 10 5 to 3 × 109 Hz. From both types of measurement, it was possible to distinguish between the cables containing water trees and those that were free from water tree structures. These approaches could therefore be developed in order to provide diagnostics for the detection of water tree damage in electrical power cables...|$|R
