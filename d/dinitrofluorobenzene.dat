[...] Sanger's initial results suggested that insulin was a smaller molecule than previously estimated (molecular weight 12,000), and that it consisted of four chains (two ending in glycine and two ending in phenylalanine), with the chains cross-linked by disulfide bonds. Sanger continued work on insulin, using <b>dinitrofluorobenzene</b> {{in combination with other}} techniques, eventually resulted in the complete sequence of insulin (consisting of only two chains, with a molecular weight of 6,000).|$|E
50|$|<b>Dinitrofluorobenzene</b> {{reacts with}} the amine group in amino acids to produce dinitrophenyl-amino acids. These DNP-amino acids are {{moderately}} stable under acid hydrolysis conditions that break peptide bonds.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between net nitrite uptake and its reduction in intact pea chloroplasts was investigated employing electron transport regulators, uncouplers, and photophosphorylation inhibitors. Observations confirmed {{the dependence of}} nitrite uptake on stromal pH and nitrite reduction but also suggested a partial dependance upon PSI phosphorylation. It was also suggested that ammonia stimulates nitrogen assimilation in the dark by association with stromal protons. Inhibition of nitrite uptake by N-ethylmaleimide and <b>dinitrofluorobenzene</b> could not be completely attributed to their inhibition of carbon dioxide fixation. Other protein binding reagents which inhibited photosynthesis showed no effect on nitrite uptake, except for p-chlormercuribenzoate which stimulated nitrite uptake. The results with N-ethylmaleimide and <b>dinitrofluorobenzene</b> tended to support the proposed presence of a protein permeation channel for nitrite uptake in addition to HNO 2 penetration. On {{the basis of a}} lack of effect by known anion uptake inhibitors, it was concluded that the nitrite uptake mechanism was distinct from that of phosphate and chloride/sulfate transport...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the present}} study, {{the effect of}} iron-deficiency anemia on delayed {{cutaneous}} hypersensitivity was measured using weanling C 57 BL/ 6 female mice which were fed either an ad libitum control diet supplemented with 25 to 30 mg Fe/kg diet (FePO 4), an iron-deficient test diet (5 to 6 mg Fe/kg diet), or a pairfed control diet (25 to 30 mg Fe/kg diet). When skin sensitizing agent (<b>dinitrofluorobenzene)</b> was applied to these animals and skin responses were measured 3 to 5 days later, anemic mice showed a significantly decreased inflammatory skin respone than either control or pairfed mice. Five days after sensitization, the animals were challenged with dinitrofluo-robenzene painted on the right ear and an equal dose of only the solvent on the left ear followed by ‘ 251 -deoxyuridine injected intraperitoneally. The ratio of either total or DNA associated radioactivity incorporated into the right over the left ears was significantly lower in anemic mice than either control or pairfed mice. A single dose of Imferon injected 24 h before the recall dose of <b>dinitrofluorobenzene</b> restored the ratio of mnIdUR incorporated in anemic mice without having any significant effect on either the control or pairfed groups. The results suggest that iron is not required for sensitization but is required for an effective inflammatory response. Am. J. Clin...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} {{of contact}} hypersensitivity is suppressed when hapten is applied topically {{to an area}} irradiated by ultraviolet B (UVB). There is no standardized procedure to induce this local immunosuppression by UVB. We investigated {{the effects of the}} following factors on induction of <b>dinitrofluorobenzene</b> contact hypersensitivity in mice, UVB dose, divided UVB exposure, timing of sensitization after irradiation, hapten concentration, hapten volume (application area), sex, age, and simultaneous sensitization on UV-exposed and nonexposed skin. The suppression was enhanced by increasing the UVB dose. When 100 mJ/cm 2 of UVB was irradiated, divided daily exposure (25 mJ × 4 d) was more suppressive than single exposure (100 mJ × 1 d). Sensitization 2 d after Irradiation (100 mJ/cm 2) induced suppression most effectively. When 25 μl of <b>dinitrofluorobenzene</b> solution was applied to exposed skin, higher concentrations induced lower suppression. When the total dose of hapten was kept constant (92, μg), the application of lower concentrations to large areas (0. 2 5 %, 25 μl) caused stronger suppression than higher concentrations (1 %, 6. 25 μl) to small areas, Simultaneous sensitization on UV-exposed and nonexposed skin revealed less suppression than sensitization only on exposed skin. The suppression of contact hypersensitivity was significantly greater in young than in old mice.

40|$|DNA is {{a target}} for ultraviolet-B-induced {{inhibition}} of contact hypersensitivity, and small DNA fragments such as thymidine dinucleotides (pTpT) can simulate several ultraviolet-induced effects. To determine whether pTpT mimics the suppressive influence of ultraviolet-B on contact hypersensitivity, we compared the effects of topical application of pTpT with those of ultraviolet-B irradiation on C 57 BL/ 6 mice sensitized to <b>dinitrofluorobenzene.</b> Mice pretreated with pTpT or ultraviolet-B irradiation showed markedly suppressed ear swelling responses to <b>dinitrofluorobenzene</b> challenge. Because tumor necrosis factor α mediates ultraviolet-B-induced suppression of contact hypersensitivity, and because pTpT exerts many ultraviolet-mimetic effects by augmenting mRNA and protein levels of effector molecules, we asked if pTpT mimics ultraviolet-B’s upregulatory influence on tumor necrosis factor α expression. Using transgenic mice carrying a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter linked to the tumor necrosis factor α promoter, we examined effects of ultraviolet-B irradiation versus intradermal injection of pTpT on tumor necrosis factor α gene transcription. Both treatments induced cutaneous chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity. Ultra- violet-B or pTpT treatment of cultured dermal fibroblasts from these mice also stimulated chloramphenicol acetyl transferase activity. To determine whether human cells responded similarly, a well- differentiated ultraviolet-responsive human squamous cell carcinoma line was treated with pTpT. pTpT increased tumor necrosis factor α mRNA expression and protein secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings expand the spectrum of ultraviolet effects mimicked by pTpT to include inhibition of contact hypersensitivity and activation of the tumor necrosis factor α gene.

40|$|Interleukin- 1 {{receptor}} antagonist (IL- 1 ra), {{a naturally}} occurring inhibitor of interleukin- 1 (IL- 1), blocks IL- 1 binding to its receptors {{but has no}} agonistic activity. IL- 1 Is thought {{to play an important}} role in contact hypersensitivity (CHS), although the effects of exogenously administered IL- 1 in CHS have been somewhat controversial. To clarify the role of IL- 1 in CHS, we studied the effect of IL- 1 receptor blockade using exogenous a-Ira and evaluated these effects on CHS. We examined the in vivo effects of local administration of recombinant human IL- 1 ra in the inurine CHS model. Local injection of IL- 1 ra to sensitized BALB/c mice just before challenge with <b>dinitrofluorobenzene</b> resulted in a significant reduction in the intensity of CHS responses, assessed by ear swelling. A dose-response study revealed that maximal inhibition of ear swelling (36 % to 43 %) was observed after intradermal injection of IL- 1 ra at doses of 10 to 100 μg/ear. This reduction in ear swelling in IL- 1 ra-injected ears consisted of less inflammatory cell infiltration and decreased edema in the dermis compared with controls. Suppression of CHS was observed when IL- 1 ra was applied in the 24 -h interval preceding challenge with <b>dinitrofluorobenzene,</b> whereas no suppressive effect was observed when IL- 1 ra was applied 48 h before or after the challenge. Local administration of IL- 1 ra to naive mice 5 h before sensitization also suppressed CHS responses. However, a- 1 ra injection did not suppress phenol-induced inflammation. These results suggest that IL- 1 ra is an effective inhibitor of both the sensitization and elicitation phases of CHS expression in mice, thus emphasizing the role of IL- 1 as an immunologic potentiator of responses associated with CHS...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to exogenous stimuli such as phorbol- 12 -myristate 13 -acetate, ultraviolet B radiation, and lipopolysaccharide, human keratinocytes produce soluble mediators {{that are important}} in primary contact irritancy including cytokines that are associated with proinflammatory properties (interleukin- 1 α [IL- 1 α], tumor necrosis factor α), chemotaxis (IL- 8), and growth activation (granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, IL- 6, transforming growth factor α). We examined qualitative and quantitative changes in selected intracellular and secreted cytokines in human keratinocyte cultures in {{response to}} non-sensitizing contact irritants (croton oil, sodium lauryl sulfate, methyl salicylate, ethyl phenylpropiolate), sensitizing irritants (oxazolone, <b>dinitrofluorobenzene),</b> and ulcerative agents (phenol, benzalkonium chloride, chromium trioxide). The chemicals were also applied to mouse skin to assess whether the chemical-specific pattern of inflammation correlated with the in vitro production of keratinocyte-derived cytokines. Although all agents elicited neutrophils to the site of chemical application, time dependent and chemical-specific patterns of inflammation could be detected. Sodium lauryl sulfate, phenol, and croton oil induced increases in IL- 8 production at non-cytotoxic concentrations in semi-confluent human keratinocyte cultures. Phenol and croton oil stimulated tumor necrosis factor α production, whereas croton oil was the only agent found to induce granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor production. Croton oil, phenol, benzalkonium chloride, and <b>dinitrofluorobenzene</b> induced the intracellular production of IL- 1 α without a concomitant release into the medium. The release of cytokines occurred in parallel with a relative increase in cytokine-specific mRNA transcripts. Studies using neutralizing antibodies to tumor necrosis factor α and IL- 1 α demonstrated that IL- 8 induction by croton oil and phenol occured directly rather than through autocrine circuits. These data suggest that a given pattern of cytokine production is chemical-specific and may predict the contribution of keratinocytes to skin inflammation...|$|E

In this study, we analyzed {{the contribution of}} dendritic cells (DC) in the induction of these two T cell subsets endowed with opposite functions. Hapten-pulsed skin- and bone marrow-derived DC, obtained from either normal C 57 BL/ 6 mice or from MHC class II (I � II �) and MHC class I(I � II �) -deficient mice, were tested {{for their ability to}} prime normal mice for CS to <b>dinitrofluorobenzene.</b> Expression of MHC class I molecules by transferred DC was mandatory both for the induction of CS and for the generation of hapten-specific CD 8 � T cells in lymphoid organs. I � II � DC were as potent as I � II � DC in priming for CS, demonstrating that activation of effector CD 8 � T cells can occur independently of CD 4 � T cell help. I � II � DC could not immunize for CS, although they could sensitize for a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to protein Ags. Moreover, I � II � DC injected simultaneously with cutaneous sensitization down-regulated the inflammatory response, suggesting that hapten presentation by MHC class II molecules could prime regulatory CD 4 � T cells. These results indicate that DC can present haptenated peptides by both MHC class I and class II molecules and activate Ag-specific CD 8 � effector and CD 4 � regulatory T cell subsets, concurrently and independently.

40|$|The {{facilitated}} diffusion of glucose across the human erythrocyte membrane {{has already been}} established by kinetic studies {{to be consistent with}} a carrier mechanism. Little is known biochemically about the carrier or the type of associations formed in its binding with glucose. In the experimental work to be described consideration was given to various possibilities of associations between membrane lipids and glucose molecules. Human erythrocyte stroma were incubated with glucosefor short periods at ice-cold temperatures and were then either extracted with lipid solvents, or freeze-dried prior to such extractions. Separation of the radioactivity and lipids in the extracts was effected by silicic acid/Hyflo column and thin-layer plate chromatography. Where possible a qualitative analysis was made of the lipid fractions associated with the radioactivity. One of the kinetic features of the system in whole cells is the saturation of the carriers with increasing glucose concentration. Indications of this were looked for in experiments with increasing amounts of glucose but recoveries of radioactivity amongst the lipids did not appear to become saturated. The effects of the reversible inhibitors phloretin and stilboestrol and of the irreversible inhibitors <b>dinitrofluorobenzene</b> (DNFB) and mercuric ions on the recovery of labelling and the chromatographic behaviour of the lipids and radioactivity have been studied. Sheep erythrocytes have no detectable sugar transfer system and so a comparison was made between sheep and human erythrocyte lipid extracts following incubation of the cells with C glucose under the same experimental conditions. The main advances resulting from the experiments has been the demonstration of a lipid soluble C glucose-containing material extractable from freeze-dried human ghosts by the methods used by Handa (1963) for glycolipids.
