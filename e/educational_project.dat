How to design <b>educational</b> <b>projects</b> successfully from both educational perspective and research perspective becomes a practical challenge. In this paper, we present a successful case to resolve this problem: we designed two <b>educational</b> <b>projects</b> in a software architecture course, based on which an empirical study about creativity in software development was carried out.

This study reports a fuzzy complexity model for <b>educational</b> <b>projects,</b> which has two primary aspects (technical aspects and transparency aspects). These aspects may not be measured precisely due to uncertain situations. Therefore, a fuzzy graph-based model to measure the relative complexity of <b>educational</b> <b>projects</b> is presented that uses an aggregation operator to resolve conflict among experts {{with respect to a}} complexity relation. The model maps the fuzzy graph into a scaled Cartesian diagram that depicts the relative degree of complexity among projects. An illustrative example for several <b>educational</b> <b>projects</b> is demonstrated to present the application of the model...|$|R

25|$|Its <b>educational</b> <b>project</b> being {{based on}} research, ENS seeks to train its {{students}} to become researchers. The main objective of the education given is getting a doctorate, and more than 85% of normaliens achieve this. The students are free {{to choose their own}} course of study but must at least attain a master's degree in research. Since, traditionally, the institution does not have the powers to grand university degrees, this entails that students have to follow courses in other universities in Paris. To this end, ENS cultivates a large number of partnerships and conventions with other higher education institutions to create master's degrees which are co-presided by two institutions. ENS works closely with the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), the Paris-Sorbonne University, the Panthéon-Sorbonne University, HEC Paris and ESSEC Business School in particular to deliver joint diplomas to a certain number of students who have followed courses shared between the two institutions. It is also the main partner in the Paris School of Economics project which it has launched along with the EHESS, the École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique (ENSAE) and the École des Ponts. This project seeks to create a unified Master's-level economics school in Paris.|$|E

The purpose of this <b>educational</b> <b>project</b> is to demonstrate the fate of the children who were imprisoned in Death camp. The idea of the project was born when one of the survivors noticed that Majdanek Museum does not inform the visitors and does not show them the lives {{of the children in the}} camp. It was hard for pupils who visited Majdanek museum to identify themselves emotionally with the things which happened in Majdanek.
