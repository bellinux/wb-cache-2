30|$|In (Majumdar and Ramchandran 2004), {{multi-level}} coset {{codes for}} PRISM architecture are presented. The codebook for each level {{is computed by}} coding bit at that level B_i and the remaining (i −  1) bits {{are determined by the}} bits at previous levels B_j (where B, i and j represents the coding bit, current coset level, and previous coset level, respectively, for 1  ≤ j ≤ i −  1). Therefore, quantization of X to the closest coset is done at the root level, which determines the path to the codebook of next level using partition tree that originally possesses the codeword for X. The encoded source bits are also determined by the codebook path and transmitted to the decoder. The total number of coset levels (and in turn the data rate) may vary depending on the distortion and noise that exist between the predictor and the received bitstream. Moreover, each coset level can be taken as a single level partition tree. In order to achieve the required rate for that level, a separate <b>dedicated</b> <b>encoder</b> and decoder can be designed. Although this slightly increases the complexity of the encoder, such a design allows the use of linear correction codes for each level and improves overall error resilience of the codec against channel and propagation errors.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} generic {{approach}} for providing enhanced security to communication systems which encode their data for reliability before encrypting {{it through a}} stream cipher for security. We call this counter-intuitive technique the encoding-encryption paradigm, and use as motivating example the standard for mobile telephony GSM. The enhanced security {{is based on a}} dedicated homophonic or wire-tap channel coding that introduces pure randomness, combined with the randomness of the noise occurring over the communication channel. Security evaluation regarding recovery of the secret key employed in the keystream generator is done through an information theoretical approach. We show that {{with the aid of a}} <b>dedicated</b> wire-tap <b>encoder,</b> the amount of uncertainty that the adversary must face about the secret key given all the information he could gather during different passive or active attacks he can mount, is a decreasing function of the sample available for cryptanalysis. This means that the wire-tap encoder can indeed provide an information theoretical security level over a period of time, but after a large enough sample is collected the function tends to zero, entering a regime in which a computational security analysis is needed for estimation of the resistance against the secret key recovery...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the design of}} a dedicated homophonic coding for a class of communication systems which, in order to provide both reliability and security, first encode the data before encrypting it, which {{is referred to as the}} encoding-encryption paradigm. The considered systems employ error-correction coding for reliability, a stream cipher for encryption, and homophonic coding to enhance the protection of the key used in the stream cipher, on which relies the security of all the system transmissions. This paper presents a security evaluation of such systems from a computational complexity point of view, which serves as a source for establishing dedicated homophonic code design criteria. The security evaluation shows that the computational complexity of recovering the secret key, given all the information an attacker could gather during passive attacks he can mount, is lower bounded by the complexity of the related LPN (Learning Parity in Noise) problem in both the average and worst case. This gives guidelines to construct a <b>dedicated</b> homophonic <b>encoder</b> which maximizes the complexity of the underlying LPN problem for a given encoding overhead. Finally, this paper proposes a generic homophonic coding strategy that fulfills the proposed design criteria and thus both enhances security while minimizing the induced overhead.
