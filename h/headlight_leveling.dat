This master’s thesis aims to be the foundation to that development. The thesis consists of several parts; a market analysis of how competitors to Scania and the general vehicle industry solve this problem; several available principles for detecting the amount of control needed; {{the construction of a}} test station for sensors, a control unit and components connected controlled by the control unit; a further theoretical and practical development of one principle – one rotational sensor connected between the chassis and the back drive axis; a state flow model programmed in Simulink that produces the control signal for the <b>headlight</b> <b>leveling</b> from the sensor input. Lastly the thesis gives some recommendations to the further development and implementation of automatic headlight level control on Scania vehicles...|$|E
