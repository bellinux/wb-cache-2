500|$|... "I {{covered this}} scene with {{another one of}} the key {{changing}} into the fat black guy, and the ignition slot turning into Maybellene. <b>I</b> <b>covered</b> a lot more cartoony foreplay scenes with a simple close-up of the fat black man's face with his hand covering his eyes. You can {{get a sense of how}} many scenes had to be altered, by how many times this close-up drawing was used. It got used a lot! At one point the original version [...] "A" [...] of Maybellene existed. Ralph had a print of it, but I have not seen it since I worked on it. We did versions [...] "A," [...] B", and [...] "C," [...] with [...] "C" [...] being the tamest and that is what got into the so-called [...] "X" [...] version of Heavy Traffic. Another scene I can recall doing multiple versions of was the guy in the racing cap, pissing on the fat black guy's ass. This was completely eliminated, causing a jump in the action." ...|$|E
500|$|Shilts {{decided to}} write And the Band Played On after {{attending}} an awards ceremony in 1983 where he was to receive a commendation for his coverage on AIDS. As described in the book, television announcer Bill Kurtis gave the keynote address and told a joke: [...] "What's the hardest part about having AIDS? Trying to convince your wife that you're Haitian." [...] Shilts responded to the joke by saying that it [...] "says everything about how the media had dealt with AIDS. Bill Kurtis felt that he could go {{in front of a}} journalists' group in San Francisco and make AIDS jokes. First of all, he could assume that nobody there would be gay and, if they were gay, they wouldn't talk about it and that nobody would take offense at that. To me, that summed up the whole problem of dealing with AIDS in the media. Obviously, the reason <b>I</b> <b>covered</b> AIDS from the start was that, to me, it was never something that happened to those other people." ...|$|E
500|$|Pat Nixon {{was listed}} on the Gallup Organization's top-ten list of the most admired women {{fourteen}} times, from 1959 to 1962 and 1968 to 1979. She was third in 1969, and remained at number two until 1972, when she was ranked number one as the most admired woman. She remained on the top-ten list until 1979, five years after her husband left office. To many, she {{was seen as an}} example of the [...] "American Dream," [...] having risen from a poor background, with her greatest popularity among the [...] "great silent majority" [...] of voters. Mary Brooks, the director of the United States Mint and a long-time friend of Pat's, illustrated some of the cultural divides present at the time when she described the First Lady as [...] "a good example to the women of this countryif they're not part of those Women's Liberation groups." [...] Additionally, it was the view of veteran UPI correspondent Helen Thomas that Pat [...] "was the warmest First Lady <b>I</b> <b>covered</b> and the one who loved people the most. I think newspeople who covered her saw a woman who was sharp, responsive, sensitive." ...|$|E
