S. nonfarm business sector during the past decade. Bosworth and Triplett found that retail trade alone contributed nearly one-half to the acceleration of multifactor productivity growth in the late 1990 ’s. At the same time, they expressed concern that productivity growth for these industries may be overstated {{because of the way}} real output is measured, especially for retail stores that sell computers and electronic devices whose quality continues to improve while prices fall. Different output concepts, data sources, and methodologies have led researchers to reach different conclusions about the sources of productivity growth and its attribution among industries.

These suggest a synthesis of the explanations for subsequent modeling of the role of services by means of the Sequential Interindustry Model (SIM), developed for examining transient processes. Services are viewed as <b>distributive,</b> <b>servicing,</b> and informative, each group with a successively larger information portion relative to materials in its output.

During this period a structural change is observed as agriculture declined in its share and service sector dominates the economy. Hence, {{in this study}} we used a Shapely decomposition method to identify the service sector contributions to per capita GDP and employment growth during two periods of (1999 - 2005) and (2005 - 2013). Per capita GDP was decomposed into employment rate, productivity, and demographic changes. The result shows that during (1999 - 2005) growth periods, Ethiopian per capita GDP growth was mainly contributed by employment rate changes originated from the agriculture sector. Whereas the service sector has the highest contribution in productivity but a negative contribution in employment change. However, during the high growth period of (2005 - 2013) the growth in per capita GDP is due to productivity growth which emanates from the service sectors specifically from the <b>distributive</b> <b>service</b> sector...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} is to describe and analyze the sectoral and spatial distribution of Department of Defense (DOD) procurement of services and to find the relationship between DOD services expenditures and change in services employment, population, and income. ^ It was discovered that defense procurement of services has, over the 1979 - 1987 period, increased faster than the overall defense budget. The findings also indicate that the sectoral composition of defense services procurement is concentrated in two categories: producer and equipment services. ^ When the spatial distribution of defense producer services allocations was examined {{it was found that}} several eastern states, notably Virginia, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, receive a high proportion of these expenditures. States specializing in military-related manufacturing, such as California and Washington, also rank highly in receipts of DOD producer services expenditures. ^ DOD equipment services procurement is allocated mainly to southern and western states, a distribution that indicates that these expenditures may be associated with both military manufacturing and base operations. ^ The third largest category of DOD services procurement are the <b>distributive</b> <b>services.</b> Many of the states receiving high levels of <b>distributive</b> <b>services</b> procurement are in the South, implying that these expenditures may be linked to the activities at military bases. ^ The spatial distribution of DOD producer services expenditures was relatively stable over the study period. And, while the spatial pattern of equipment and <b>distributive</b> <b>services</b> was less stable, overall, the geographic distribution of DOD services procurement exhibited a high degree of spatial continuity, supporting the incremental model of federal budget allocations. ^ The relationship between percentage change in services procurement and percentage change in services employment, income, and population was described through regression analysis. However, in the statistical models used here, the relationship between services procurement and services employment, population, and income was found to be very weak. ^ Overall, the results indicate that DOD services procurement is concentrated in those service sectors most critical to regional development. However, little statistical evidence was found to support the argument that these outlays are influencing state-level patterns of employment, population, and income growth. ...|$|E

The study focuses on how LSPs create value by {{taking advantage of}} being connected and exploring the presence of various forms of interdependence.

40|$|The {{increasingly}} complex character of American economy has created powerful incentives for {{new methods of}} distribution and marketing. First, as costs of distribution become a more significant part of total costs, producers seek the economic advantages of more efficient distributive methods. In other instances, new marketing techniques—combining <b>distributive</b> <b>services</b> with the supply of goods—have become important competitive devices. Since {{many of the new}} methods adopted are, on their face, similar to those used to establish monopolies or other market controlling combinations, it has been difficult to determine whether an attempted change in market structure would benefit consumers by lowering distribution costs or harm them by obstructing competition. In addition, substantial policy considerations have been advanced in opposition to any change which harms small competitors, even though the harm they suffer might be attributed to their inability to improve their own efficiency. To accommodate these goals—seeking greater efficiency, protecting competitors, and preserving competition—Congress enacted the Robinson- Patman Act, but instead of resolving these conflicts the act seems only to have added questions concerning its meaning...|$|E

This analysis was motivated by the possibility of exploit the optical layer facilities in the transport network, to carry <b>distributive</b> <b>services,</b> such as video channels (e. g.

The strategies and algorithms reported in this paper arise from a generalisation of those ones, which have been previously reported in literature. They are wavelength path (WP: which does not make use of wavelength conversion), virtual wavelength path (VWP: which make full use of wavelength conversion), and partial virtual wavelength path (PVWP: making a parsimonious use of wavelength conversion). The analysis shows the characteristics and performance of those strategies and algorithms considering, as a figure of merit, either the number of wavelengths or the system scale (dimensions of the optical nodes), and compare one to each other in order to point out advantages and disadvantages. The main result is that multicast optical paths can favourably be accommodated in a WDM network, and the strategy we propose, making a parsimonious use of wavelength conversion, allows the lowest system scale to be obtained with a very low number of wavelength converters...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{reconfigurable}} and transparentwavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks. Reconfigurability {{is used to}} achieve higher surveillance andthroughput in the network. This is done by wavelength selectiveand independent network elements. These network elements canaccomplish bypass and protection switching ofthe traffic. Transparency in the optical layer enables the transport networkto accept new bit rates, codes and formats of the clients. Theenabling technologies to achieve a reconfigurable andtransparent network are integrated tuneable devices andswitches. In this thesis some of these devices have beenexperimentally evaluated according to theirs cascadability andcrosstalk performance. A unidirectional self-healing wavelength divisionmultiplexed ring was designed, assembled and evaluated. Byutilising WDM, logical networks could be constructed withoptical add drop multiplexers (OADM) to support communicativeand <b>distributive</b> <b>services.</b> The main transmission limitation ofthe ring was homogenous broadening of the opticalamplifiers. The second network element investigated, was the opticalcrossconnect (OXC). The OXC was comprised of optical InP andLiNbO 3 switches and tuneable filters, which were experimentallyevaluated. Two OXCs and an OADM were installed in the Stockholmgigabit network (SGN) with fault and configurationmanagement. The cascadability of OXCs with reshaping repeaters andoptical or electrical switches was investigated. The jitter ofthe OXC with electrical switches limited its performance, whilethe OXC with optical switch was limited by its crosstalk. Crosstalk especially intra-band crosstalk, which beats with thesignal, is a severe limitation of optical networks. Experimentsand simulations were performed on the time dependence of theintra-band crosstalk. It was shown and experimentally confirmedthat the quasi-correlated intra-band crosstalk could be theworst case. In {{the next phase of}} the network five OADMs and one OXC,which interconnected a unidirectional and a bidirectionalprotected ring, were integrated into SGN with a web basedmanagement system. The OADMs were evaluated in a recirculating loop toinvestigate the cascadability of the nodes. The nodes could bedivided into optical channel or fibre protection and notch ordemultiplex filtering. An optimum of loss of the cascadedoptical amplifiers were found, which maximised the gainflatness and the signal to noise ratio. The OXC utilising fixedWDMs and polymer switches was designed and evaluated takinginto account the configuration, fault handling and performancemonitoring of the optical layer. Data services were evaluatedas clients to the optical layer, especially to provide opticalprotection without interfering with its client.

These dynamics have a direct influence and will trigger off service innovation. Firstly, the drivers of the service economy are presented, many of them fostering service innovation as a way to face new societal and business challenges. Secondly, emerging developments are discussed to identify the most promising service innovation dynamics. Finally, foresight scenarios demonstrate possible future trends of the new service economy. These scenarios are based on a methodology developed and applied in the context of an EC-funded project on Sectoral Innovation Systems. This exercise is performed for the overall set of services activities although a particular focus is given on activities such as knowledge intensive business <b>services</b> and <b>distributive</b> trade <b>services.</b> Results indicate that emerging developments are those related to the reconciliation between industrialisation and customisation associated with ICT, ageing population, sustainable development and service regression and extension dynamics.

40|$|Among the {{segments}} {{of economic development}} and shifts in the Miskolc agglomeration the present study introduces some characteristics of the functional, sectoral and regional differentiation of economic transformation. The functional, sectoral and geographical distribution of business corporations in the 35 settlements of the Miskolc agglomeration in 2016 may help to interpret and assess economic processes adapted to local characteristics in the past quarter-century. During the research, only those operating businesses were considered that had net sales of 20 million HUF or more in 2015. An empirical study of 640 active businesses in 35 settlements reveals the regional inequalities and sectoral concentration of the economy. The intensity of the spatial structure {{of the economy is}} uneven within the Miskolc agglomeration and spatial specialization can also be observed in the economic hinterland of Miskolc. The economic development induced significant changes in the spatial structure of three towns (Felsőzsolca, Nyékládháza, and Alsózsolca). Services (e. g. personal, <b>distributive,</b> and <b>services</b> for other businesses) as well as commerce, logistics and leisure functions concentrated in these towns strengthened their positions in the spatial structure. In addition, the technological and industrial parks of these towns are playing an increasing role. However, the towns of the agglomeration cannot or can hardly be regarded as economic competitors of Miskolc, i. e. the urban region has not become polycentric, and the inhabitants of these towns are not totally independent of Miskolc. In the case of Sajóbábony (due to its special situation) and Szikszó (despite its economic recovery) the functional, sectoral and regional transformation is not clear yet.

Specifically, the study investigates the levels of satisfaction associated with various combinations of procedural, interactional and <b>distributive</b> justice related <b>service</b> recovery strategies. Using especially designed video vignettes of a hotel service breakdown, respondents rated their levels of satisfaction for the video vignettes that depicted varying levels of: (a) level of concern shown by the service provider, (b) whether policy was adhered to, (c) degree of 'voice' given to the customer, and (d) type of compensation. Between subject MANOVA analyses revealed a number of main effects and interactions. Results clearly show that satisfaction varied significantly depending on the various combinations of recovery measures. In particular, a two-way interaction between adherence to policy and type of compensation was found. Furthermore, {{it was found that}} respondents expressed higher satisfaction with the service when a 50 % refund was given, and the provider was seen to be adhering to policy, rather than doing a special favor for the customer. In contrast, when a token measure of compensation is given (i. e. giving away a couple of drink vouchers), respondents expressed higher levels of satisfaction if the service provider was doing a special favor rather than merely adhering to company policy.

40|$|Purpose: The main aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the <b>distributive</b> utilisation of <b>services</b> provided by the Cancer Council of Western Australia according to age, social disadvantage and geographic location. Results were used to determine if social justice principles in terms of service provision were upheld. Methods: Cross-sectional study design to evaluate utilisation of cancer support services over a 12 -week period in 2007 using administrative records. Service utilisation incidence rates (population information obtained from de-identified cancer registry data) and incidence rate ratios were calculated by gender, age group, cancer type, socioeconomic status and location. Results: The Information services (52 %, n[*]=[*] 4, 932) were the most popular Cancer Council of Western Australia (CCWA) services followed by Emotional Support services (21 %, n[*]=[*] 2, 045). All CCWA services were more likely to be accessed by those with a lower socioeconomic status, except for Clinical Services. The rate of utilisation for patients with cancer in the 65 + years age group was found to be under-serviced relative to the 40 – 64 years age group. Conclusions: Overall, the study has shown that CCWA services are not provided uniformly (horizontal equity) across strata of socio-economic status. Given that the prevalence of cancer generally increases with socio-economic advantage, the findings were notable in regard to one particular outcome. Results for age indicate that there may be some underlying accessibility issues for the aged population.

A review of selected literature was conducted to gain background and supportive information in reference to the study. The data used in the study were collected through a statewide survey. A survey instrument was developed that had four parts. The first part contained questions seeking demographic information. The second and third parts contained attitudinal statements and factors to consider when hiring the handicapped. The last part dealt with identifying specific entry-level positions in which the visually or hearing impaired could work. ^ A stratified random sample was drawn from the population of Nebraska food service and general merchandising training sponsors associated with marketing and distributive education programs. The sample was stratified by occupational category. Once the sample was selected, the survey instrument was personally delivered to the participants. An explanation of the study was given to each participant and then each was asked to complete an instrument. ^ Findings and Conclusions. (1) There was no evidence of {{a significant difference between the}} overall attitudes of the food service and general merchandising training sponsors regarding the employment of the visually and hearing impaired. (2) The food service and general merchandising training sponsors 2 ̆ 7 attitudes were more positive toward employing the hearing impaired than the visually impaired.

They felt they could employ persons with hearing impairments without making these major alterations. (4) A majority of the food service and general merchandising training sponsors felt it would be unsafe for persons with visual impairments to work in their firms. They did not feel, however, that it would be unsafe for the hearing impaired to work in their firms. (5) The food service and general merchandising training sponsors believed hard of hearing persons could work in entry-level positions to a greater extent than deaf persons. (6) The food service and general merchandising training sponsors believed partially sighted persons could work in entry-level positions to a greater extent than blind persons. (7) The food service and general merchandising training sponsors indicated a preference for employing the hard of hearing, deaf, and partially sighted in entry-level positions involving very little or no customer contact.
