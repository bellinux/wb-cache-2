Then the two men came over to him, and he felt his bonds softly loosened. Only the gag remained in his mouth, {{and one by one}} his garments were removed from him. A trained valet {{could not have been more}} careful or deft. The contents of all his pockets were hastily run through and restored. His under garments were felt all over for any hidden hiding place. Even his shoes were taken off, and the <b>inner</b> <b>sole</b> cut through with a knife. Finally the two men turned towards Phineas Duge. Their faces were a mute expression of the fact that the search was over. Phineas Duge motioned them to remove the gag. They did so, and Vine, who was now free, stood up and commenced to dress.|$|E

Later, the effect of SBR-r on the cure behavior, mechanical performance, swelling, and crosslink density of reused rubber was investigated, with more emphasis placed on the effect of both particle size and loading of waste filler. Cure characteristics such as optimum cure time and scorch time were then reduced by the increasing amount of SBR-r filler. Owing to the reinforced nature of the largest particle size SBR-r, the best results for the mechanical properties of NBR were those in which SBR-r was added {{at the end of the}} cure process. The study has thus shown that SBR residue (SBR-r) can be used as an economical alternative filler in NBR...|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of wooden shoes was widespread in medieval Europe. They {{were made from}} {{a single piece of}} wood roughly cut into shoe form. A variant of this form was the clog, which were wooden soles to which a leather upper was attached. The sole and heel were made from one piece of maple or ash two inches thick, and a little longer and broader than the desired size of shoe. The outer side of the sole and heel was fashioned with a long chisel-edged implement, called the clogger’s knife or stock; while a second implement, called the groover, made a groove {{around the side of the}} sole. With the use of a 'hollower', the <b>inner</b> <b>sole's</b> contours were adapted to the shape of the foot. The leather uppers were then fitted closely to the groove around the sole. Clogs were of great advantage to workers in muddy and damp conditions, keeping the feet dry and comfortable.|$|R

40|$|Objective: {{to assess}} {{awareness}} of drug and non-drug treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and compliance in patients {{before and after}} their participation in an education program, {{as well as the}} survival of the knowledge and the need for retraining. Subjects and methods. The study included 43 patients with RA: 23 study group patients were trained according to an education program (Rheumatoid Arthritis Health School), 20 patients formed a control group. The education program consisted of 4 daily 90 -min studies. Adherence to drug and non-drug treatments was assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Results. In the study group, the basic therapy remained stably high (about 100 %) within 6 months. At 3 months after studies, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs could be discontinued in 23. 8 % (p < 0. 05). After 6 months, the proportion of patients using laser therapy increased by 57. 1 % (p < 0. 01) and accounted for 47. 8 %; the use of electric and ultrasound treatments showed a 55. 6 % increase (p < 0. 01) and was 60. 9 %. The number of patients who were compliant to the procedures for shaping a correct functional stereotype increased by 14 and 10 times following 3 and 6 months (60. 9 % and 43. 5 %, respectively; p < 0. 01). After 3 months, there was a {{rise in the number of}} patients using hand ortheses by 75. 0 % (30. 4 %; p < 0. 01); knee ortheses by 50. 0 % (39. 1 %; p < 0. 01); individual <b>inner</b> <b>soles</b> by 71. 4 % (52. 2 %; p < 0. 01); and walking sticks and crutches by 60. 0 % (34. 8 %; p < 0. 01). Following 6 months, the positive changes remained only after the relative use of <b>inner</b> <b>soles</b> (60. 9 %) and support means (34. 8 %; p < 0. 05). The number of patients who regularly did physical activity increased by 5. 3 (69. 6 %; р < 0. 01) and 3. 7 (47. 8 %; p < 0. 01) times at 3 and 6 months, respectively. The trend in the control group was less pronounced, determining statistically significant differences between the groups in most indicators (р < 0. 05). Conclusion. The education program retains high compliance to the basic therapy, reduces needs for symptomatic drugs, and enhances adherence to physiotherapy, methods for shaping a correct motor stereotype, orthesis wearing, and regular physical activity. The maximum positive result of the Rheumatoid Arthritis Health School was achieved after 3 months; this effect slightly diminished at 6 months.

50|$|The {{traditional}} shoemaker would {{measure the}} feet {{and cut out}} upper leathers according to the required size. These parts were fitted and stitched together.

The insole was then attached to a last made of wood, which was used to form the shoe. Some lasts were straight, while curved lasts came in pairs: one for left shoes, the other for right shoes. The 'lasting' procedure then secured the leather upper to the sole with tacks. The soles were then hammered into shape; the heel lifts were then attached with wooden pegs and the worn out-sole was nailed down to the lifts.

40|$|Intercropping {{is widely}} used by {{smallholder}} farmers in developing countries, and attracting attention {{in the context of}} ecological intensification of agriculture in developed countries. There is little experience with intercropping of food crops in Western Europe. Yields in intercrops depend on planting patterns of the mixed species in interaction with local growing conditions. Here we present data of two years field experimentation on yield and yield components of a wheat-maize intercrop system in different planting configurations in the Netherlands. Treatments included sole crops of wheat (SW) and maize (SM), a replacement intercrop consisting of strips of six wheat rows alternating with two maize rows (6 : 2 WM), as well as subtractive or additive designs, based on skip-row (6 : 0 WM, 0 : 2 WM) and add-row (8 : 2 WM, 6 : 3 WM) configurations. The land equivalent ratio (LER) of intercrops varied from 1. 18 to 1. 30 in 2013 and from 0. 97 to 1. 08 in 2014. Wheat grown in the border rows of wheat strips had higher ear number per meter row, greater kernel number per ear, and greater yield per meter row than wheat in <b>inner</b> rows and <b>sole</b> wheat, indicating reduced competition. Wheat in the border rows in the intercrops had, however, reduced thousand kernel weight and harvest index, indicating that competition in border rows intensified over time. Intercropping negatively affected maize biomass and thousand kernel weight, especially in add-row treatments. This study indicates that there is a potential yield benefit for the wheat-maize intercropping system under Western European growing conditions. However, the LER was affected by yearly variation in weather conditions and significantly greater than one in only one of the two years of the study. </p...|$|R

40|$|The high {{demands for}} cheap {{footwear}} {{can only be}} satisfied by mass fabrication. Costumed footwear would represent a regress, despite the advantages that it brings. This paper regards mainly the demands that mass footwear requires, {{in order to maintain}} the health of the foot. The desire to maintain the foot shape and functionality requires certain last forms and fabrication algorithms. We analyze certain aspects referring to: the correct design of the <b>inner</b> <b>sole,</b> insuring the flexibility of the lower part of the footwear by choosing the right type of materials and confection systems, choosing the right height of the heel, setting the adequate shape by increasing the number of different shoe sizes. In order to give a loose space to the adults’ toes, where they are not pressed, but have a complete range of motion, the orthopedists and the last specialists have set several requirements for building the contour of the <b>inner</b> <b>sole.</b> The technique of building a bond between the footwear forepart and the inferior ensemble is dependent to the purpose and partially to the fashion demands of the shoe. The sole shape is influenced by the buyers, as seen by the development of the ex-flex footwear. There must be noted that in this case, the work of the model designer coincides with the exigencies of the specialist in footwear health. With the help of certain functional considerations and of several mechanical calculations, it can be proven that a heel with a height of 3 cm does not necessarily have a negative impact on the foot health. This is why even the orthopedics consider this limit as acceptable. Higher heels must be avoided if we want to maintain a normal function and development of the foot. ...|$|E

They must also maximize movement, and provide safety and comfort for firefighters who work in extreme conditions. The structure of {{protective footwear}} for firefighters consists of the main body, <b>inner</b> <b>sole,</b> protective sole, lining, shin guard, outer sole, and slip prevention grooves. There are two types footwear: rubber footwear and leather footwear. Rubber footwear uses vulcanized rubber on the outside, and aramid fiber for the lining, and has a pulling loop-type opening. Leather footwear has leather material on the outside, penetration prevention fabric on the inside, and a zipper-type opening. According to KFIS 008 (KFIS 2001), protective footwear for firefighters in Korea {{must be at least}} 30  cm high {{from the bottom of the}} outer sole. When the heel and soles are attached to the upper leather, no metal parts such as nails or screws can be used. The weight limitation for rubber footwear is 2.8  kg, and the limitation for leather footwear is 3.0  kg. The evaluation categories for protective footwear for firefighters include tension, electricity-resistance, water-resistance, heat-resistance, heat transmission, and internal heat conduction. The international and domestic standards for protective footwear for firefighters include NFPA 1971 (National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 2013), CSN EN 15090 (Safety Protection Standards (CSN EN) 2012), and ISO 15538 (International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 2001).|$|E

The subjects wore Shimano M 037 shoes and used a standard clipless and toe-clipped pedal. The seat height was set at 100 % of subject's trochanteric height. Plantar pressures were recorded over 12 consecutive crank cycles at a constant speed for each of the power outputs.

Whether there is any dominance of any of the metatarsals, and any difference in plantar pressures between clipped and clipless pedal. There was {{a significant difference in the}} pressure at many positions of the foot, but the sites were different for each individual. General regression analysis indicated that pedal type had a statistically significant effect on plantar pressure at the sites of 1 (st) metatarsal (p= 0. 042), 3 (rd) metatarsal (p< 0. 001), 5 (th) metatarsal (< 0. 001), 2 (nd) (p= 0. 018) and 5 (th) toe (p< 0. 001), lateral midfoot (p< 0. 001) and central heel (p< 0. 001) areas.

40|$|Give Me the Ingredients and I’ll Give You the Salad: Ryan Gander Interviewed by Alex Coles Alex Coles: Was the {{exhibition}} with Michael Marriott at the Russian Club [Ernö Goldfinger v Groucho Marx, 2011] your first approach to Goldfinger’s Willow Road {{in terms of}} making an actual installation premised on your response to the house? Ryan Gander: The first time my interest in Goldfinger made its way into a work was in the form of postcard I did in 2005 [Of Any Actual Person Living Or Dead (collaboration with Aurélien Froment), 2005]. When I was writing the children’s book [The Boy Who Always Looked Up, 2003], largely based on Goldfinger’s Trellick Tower [1972], I visited Willow Road. Although the tower was interesting because it was a failure, I found Willow Road much more engaging because it helps you to understand the multiplicity of his thinking as an architect. The light switches, the bannister, the post box – everything is carefully thought out. AC: Trellick Tower and Willow Road are opposites: one is a private commission for a middle class client and full of subtle details, while the other is a public housing project with a brutal sense of order and anonymity. I guess the tower is much more widely known precisely because of its negative impact, but as a design the house is certainly the more interesting of the two. RG: When the National Trust approached me to do something at Willow Road - they’d read my children’s story and seen the show with Michael - it seemed like a brilliant way to extend a line of enquiry that had begun a decade ago. The way I’ve approached this project is to try and consider how, if he were alive, Goldfinger would approach the house’s design. To help articulate this I’ve introduced a series of different things into the house. When the viewer enters the building they won’t necessarily notice my interventions [...] . AC: Where have you taken the cue for each of the works? Is it from the house itself or from things that Goldfinger mentioned about it in interviews? RG: Both. What I’ve attempted to do is respond to his sensibility, and listening to a lot of archive interviews with the various people who knew Goldfinger helped. To give you an example, in Willow Road there’s a raised stage on the first floor with a plan chest built into it and concertinaing doors to allow more light and space. Both were designed around Goldfinger’s wife, Ursula Blackwell, being a painter. Goldfinger realised all of these details with the perfect economy of forms. Throughout, I’ve responded to the little tricks and devices Goldfinger uses, but I’ve responded to them by making a series of artworks that are positioned in the house as if they’ve always been there. AC: To just jump back to {{the exhibition}} with Michael for a moment: one of your pieces in the exhibition was based on a Surrealist mood board and the other was a script, right? RG: It was a transcript of one of my loose association lectures that mentioned Goldfinger, [Karl] Marx and Michael. AC: So where the exhibition at the Russian Club was more of an obtuse take on Willow Road, the present show… RG: …is more immersive. AC: But it’s immersive in a very particular way. I’m interested in what happens if the visitor to the exhibition doesn’t pick up the information sheet with the details of your intervention and just experiences the house. Would they necessarily notice your intervention? RG: Probably not, and I quite like that. I think of the works in the show as off-cuts that, in some sort of parallel reality, could exist as {{part of the fabric of}} Willow Road. Each of the works takes a different position. There’s works like the moneybox [Anyone with a family is motived by money, 2014] – that’s based on the chairs and tables Goldfinger’s daughter, Elizabeth, made from slotted together sections of wood. The moneybox is made from laser cut plywood – you just push the pieces out of the sheet and slot them together to create your moneybox. Then there’s works like [Your nostalgia, 2014], which consists of a pair of Nike Air Max trainers cast in bronze, left by the door. This refers to the way I, as an artist am a guest in the house of someone I admire – hence why I take my shoes off. And then there’s works like [Things just happen to me, 2014], a chess set made by reinterpreting parts from a Bedford van. This was based on my Dad’s description of the parts he’d encountered when he worked for Vauxhall in Ellesmere Port in the 1970 s. A kind of accidental aesthetic enters the work here because the components are a result of what my Dad said and the default forms are based on those in a Vauxhall Bedford van from decades ago. This notion of accident finds a parallel of sorts in the works of Goldfinger’s neighbour in Hampstead - the Surrealist Max Ernst. I listened to an interview with one of Goldfinger’s friends in which he speaks of how Ursula and Goldfinger used to have dinner parties that Ernst would attend. He talks of how Ursula used to make the same dish each time: to eat, a Russian black bread with caviar, and to drink, a dark tea with black rum in it [both laugh]. So one of the works is called Situational displays: a dish for a dish with Phil Mayer [2014], which is an update of her dish and drink: molasses tea loaf with red caviar and a rum and ginger based cocktail. These are served in ceramic vessels designed and fabricated by Phil [Mayer] from my studio. In a way, the whole history of the house is woven into this work – it’s a sort of allegory of the creative act. AC: Can you tell me more about the work The way things collide (Phaidon book meets <b>inner</b> <b>sole)</b> [2012]? RG: Its one of a series of ‘collisions’ where I take two objects that aren’t ordinarily associated and put them together: it could be a USM cabinet and a used condom or a Martino Gamper stool and a macaron. The one that you’re referring to I thought would work well in Goldfinger’s studio, which also contains his library. It’s carved from an intensely dark oak, which gives it a sort of musty tobacco look, like it’s been there for years. I liked the idea that this atlas of architecture has all of these iconic houses in it. When Willow Road was built the atlas was not yet published, hence an antiquated version of it in wood. The other component of the work is a carving of a sweaty used <b>inner</b> <b>sole</b> that has been placed beside the book - by comparison with the formal context of the atlas, a more domestic gesture. AC: Can you also tell me about the three lamp works in the exhibition? RG: The first is a lamp that replaces Goldfinger’s original, and clamps onto a shelf in his studio [A lamp made by the artist for his wife (twenty ninth attempt, 2014]; the second is in the hallway [A lamp made by the artist for his wife (twentieth attempt, 2013]; and I haven’t quite decided where the third one [A lamp made by the artist for his wife (eighteenth attempt, 2013] will go yet. When you look at each one you initially think, “Oh, it’s a lamp. ” but then you look again and notice that it’s made out of a paper towel holder and a bit of gaffer tape – not things that you’d associate with professionally made lamps. AC: What about the video work [A flawed and wounded man bleeding frames onto a page, 2014]? RG: Its based on my story The Boy Who Always Looked Up. I went to a place that does sound effects for films and cartoons and asked a voiceover artist to read the book in a Jackanory style, whilst at the same time two people provided sound effects. Usually sound effects are pre-recorded but I wanted something more like the Goon Show, so I asked them to perform live with the narrator. The video consists of the reading of the story with the sound effects in one-take - accidents and mistakes retained. Here, it was the space between the visible and the invisible or the audible and the inaudible that interested me. The video will be on constant loop on the old fashioned tube TV in the lounge of Willow Road. AC: In terms of the trajectory of your thinking about Goldfinger within the broader context of your practice, what is the status of the present exhibition for you? RG: The exhibition feeds into another, much larger, project that I’m just starting on. This future project consists of a series of show houses that are designed for creative types: one for an artist, one for a musician and one for an illustrator. From the front they’ll just look like a row of identical cottages, but from the back and above each one is totally different as they are tailored to each of their projected inhabitants. Like Goldfinger’s Willow Road, every fitting and fixture will be bespoke. In this sense The artists have the keys is a crucial stepping-stone in my work...|$|E
