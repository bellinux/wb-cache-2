500|$|I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One is the {{follow-up}} to Yo La Tengo's highly acclaimed 1995 album Electr-O-Pura, which was ranked at number 9 in The Village Voices 1995 Pazz & Jop critics' poll. Electr-O-Pura marked a new creative {{direction for the}} band. According to singer and guitarist Ira Kaplan, [...] "I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album {{is going to sound}} like [...] we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right." [...] At the time, Kaplan also explained that the lyrics used to come last: [...] "What will really happen is somebody will start playing and we'll all fall in and play for a long time. We'll finish playing an hour later and kinda say, 'Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> you did?' Then we'll write something down—or maybe we won't." ...|$|E

"Because he who {{is called}} the Helper said as much, and {{whatever}} he may be he is no liar. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> Red Eve told you when she awoke from that dream of hers, which was no dream? And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> Sir Andrew told you as to a certain meeting in the snow--pest upon it!" [...] and he wiped some of the driving flakes from his face--"Sir Andrew, who is a saint, and, therefore, like Murgh, can be no liar?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{very wrong}} of Gaspard; but, dearest Eda, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> {{is written in}} God's Word,--`Love your enemies?' It is wrong to hate anybody." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Of course I {{may be all}} wrong, but I'll {{give it to you}} {{for what}} it is worth. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> my father said about those papers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{apparently}} {{became of}} less importance when I did not come," [...] {{he said with}} a trace of dryness. [...] "There is a reliable postal service in this country. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> exactly <b>what</b> day <b>you</b> went to the Lake on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} you like me--a little. Oh Fred, {{if you were to}} go and never to come back I should die. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> Mariana? 'My life is dreary. He cometh not,' she said. She said, 'I am aweary, aweary; I would that I were dead!' <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> that? <b>What</b> has mother been saying to you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't bother you. But you--" [...] The {{lieutenant}} {{turned to}} Dave. [...] "I'll bear you in mind, my fine young cock-of-the-walk,--and I'll take you down a peg or two ere I'm <b>done</b> with <b>you,</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> I say!"

6000|$|... "There, papa!--Now {{you must}} be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who is carefulness itself. <b>Do</b> not <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> Mr. Perry said, so many years ago, when I had the measles?

6000|$|... "That's possible. It's a hard {{country and}} Jake took some chances {{when he brought}} you out across the snow. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> much about <b>what</b> {{happened}} when {{you were on the}} trail?" ...|$|R
50|$|One day, a Mullah asks Sharif, “So, I see you’ve {{stopped coming}} to the mosque! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> even <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> Namaz is?” To this, Sharif calmly replies, {{pointing}} at His own body, “I dwell in this mosque, so why go and come?

6000|$|... "Ah; {{but tell}} me the truth. <b>Remember</b> <b>what</b> we said as we parted,--about being friends. One tells one's friend the real truth. But I suppose <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> we said?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's no use," [...] Nora replied. [...] "Stephen simply wouldn't <b>do</b> it. <b>You</b> must <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{yourself}} said--procedure will be altered. So much of {{the government}} of the country will be done outside the House. Stephen has everything mapped out. You are going to be Prime Minister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} old rogue," [...] said Mr. Oldbuck; [...] "don't suppose I think the worse {{of you for}} your profession; they are only prejudiced fools and coxcombs that <b>do</b> so. <b>You</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> old Tully says in his oration, pro Archia poeta, {{concerning}} one of your confraternity--quis nostrum tam anino agresti ac duro fuit--ut--ut--I forget the Latin--the meaning is, which of us was so rude and barbarous as to remain unmoved at {{the death of the}} great Roscius, whose advanced age was so far from preparing us for his death, that we rather hoped one so graceful, so excellent in his art, ought to be exempted from the common lot of mortality? So the Prince of Orators spoke of the stage and its professor." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Yes; and if {{you will}} listen I'll tell you all. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> {{happened}} when I {{came into the room}} last night? Why, she turned colour and nearly fainted away. That was because she knew me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jack, do you {{remember}} when we parted at my home; when you left on this terrible trail, now ended, thank God! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> an ordeal that was for me? Must I go through it again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'La! my dear miss,' said Mistress Pauncefort, 'I {{should never}} have thought of such a thing! <b>Do</b> not <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> {{the old man said}} at Weymouth, [...] "there is many a boat will live in a rougher sea than a ship;" [...] and it is such an {{unlikely}} thing, it is indeed, Miss Venetia. I am certain sure my lord can manage a boat as well as a common sailor, and master is hardly less used to it than he. La! miss, don't make yourself nervous about any such preposterous ideas. And I dare say you will find them in the saloon when you go down again. Really I should not wonder. I think you had better wear your twill dress; I have put the new trimming on.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Ben sat thoughtfully {{for some}} time, and then, {{making all the}} {{preparations}} which Toby knew so well signified a long bit of advice, he said: [...] "Toby, my boy, I've been with a circus, man an' boy, nigh to forty years, an' I've seen lots of youngsters start in just as you re goin' to start in tomorrow; but the most of them petered out, because they got to knowin' more 'n them that learned 'em <b>did.</b> Now, <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> I say, an' you'll find it good advice: whatever business you get into, don't think you {{know all about it}} before you've begun. <b>Remember</b> that <b>you</b> can always learn somethin', no matter how old you are, an' keep your eyes an' ears open, an' your tongue between your teeth, an' you'll amount to somethin', or my name hain't Ben." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] I answered, [...] "there {{are certain}} writers to whom {{humanity}} owes much, whose talent is yet of so shy or delicate or retrospective a type {{that we do}} well to link it with certain quaint places or certain perishing associations. It would not be unnatural {{to look for the}} spirit of Horace Walpole at Strawberry Hill, or even for the shade of Thackeray in Old Kensington. But let us have no antiquarianism about Dickens, for Dickens is not an antiquity. Dickens looks not backward, but forward; he might look at our modern mobs with satire, or with fury, but he would love to look at them. He might lash our democracy, but it would be because, like a democrat, he asked much from it. We will not have all his books bound up under the title of 'The Old Curiosity Shop.' Rather we will have them all bound up under the title of 'Great Expectations.' Wherever humanity is he would have us face it and make something of it, swallow it with a holy cannibalism, and assimilate it with the digestion of a giant. We must take these trippers as he would have taken them, and tear out of them their tragedy and their farce. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> now <b>what</b> the angel said at the sepulchre? 'Why seek ye the living among the dead? He is not here; he is risen.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know about}} that. If I am so, it doesn't bring me happiness. ... <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> I told you once, about my being a preacher--disgrace, ruin, and all that--and my rainbow-chasing dream out here after a--a lost girl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know of her, {{and about}} her,' she replied, 'from Omer and Joram. I {{was there at}} seven o'clock this morning. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> Steerforth said to me about this unfortunate girl, that time when I saw you both at the inn?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is a woman," [...] Nancy said, {{with what}} seemed a touch of vehemence. [...] "It's useless to expect you to understand.... <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> I said to you about her? How I appealed {{to you when you}} married to try to {{appreciate}} her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘There’ll be a Fire to-night,’ he said, {{removing}} from her. ‘There’ll be Fires this winter-time, {{to light}} the dark nights, East, West, North, and South. When you see the distant sky red, they’ll be blazing. When you see the distant sky red, think of me no more; or, if <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> a Hell was lighted up inside of me, and think you see its flames reflected in the clouds. Good night. Good bye!’ She called to him; but he was gone. She sat down stupefied, until her infant roused her {{to a sense of}} hunger, cold, and darkness. She paced the room with it the livelong night, hushing it and soothing it. She said at intervals, ‘Like Lilian, when her mother died and left her!’ Why was her step so quick, her eye so wild, her love so fierce and terrible, whenever she repeated those words? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little alteration, {{except the}} growth of our dear children, has taken place since you left us. The blue lake and snow-clad mountains--they never change; and I think our placid home and our {{contented}} hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws. My trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me, and I am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy, kind faces around me. Since you left us, but one change {{has taken place in}} our little household. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>remember</b> on <b>what</b> occasion Justine Moritz entered our family? Probably <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not; I will relate her history, therefore in a few words. Madame Moritz, her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the third. This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill. My aunt observed this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house. The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it. Hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are more refined and moral. A servant in Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France and England. Justine, thus received in our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.|$|R
