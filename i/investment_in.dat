40|$|<b>Investments</b> <b>in</b> {{human capital}} (employees) include <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> the direct {{assurance}} of working abilities, <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> {{health and well-being}} and <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> loyalty to the company. These investments are crucial for the long-term existence and development of a company, but their value is not disclosed on the assets side of the classical balance sheet. The most important argument given by the proponents {{of this approach is}} that the economic benefits stemming from such investments are uncertain. However, <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> human capital are those with the highest long-term benefits for the company. Therefore, human capital is the only element of the business process that can add value. Other elements (means of production, materials and services) just transfer their value to products and services. This paper discusses the elements of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> human capital and the methods used to evaluate these investments. This is followed by the impact that treatment of <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> employees in classical accounting has on the true and fair view of financial statements.

For example, while foreign direct <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> Chongqing grew, foreign <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> other Western Chinese cities like Guizhou, Guangxi, and Ningxia declined significantly, dropping about USD $19.71, $250.96 million, and $34.54 million respectively.|$|E
