500|$|A British {{parliamentary}} motion {{put forward}} by Labour MP Kate Hoey in February 2013 to retrospectively condemn the Viscount attacks and memorialise the victims {{on the anniversary of}} the second shootdown prompted outcry in the Zimbabwean press, with the Herald branding it a racist [...] "Rhodie motion" [...] intended to antagonise the Mugabe administration and its supporters. Dumiso Dabengwa, a former ZIPRA commander, described the move as a provocation motivated by race that went against the spirit of the amnesty enacted at Lancaster House. Christopher Mutsvangwa, a diplomat and political analyst, took a similar line, calling Hoey's proposed commemoration [...] "a provocation... means they only regard the death of white people alone during the struggle. There is no mention of what happened to our sons and daughters in and outside the country." [...] ZAPU's official response to Hoey's motion included the assertion that in all conflicts [...] "civilians <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> cross-fires due to faulty intelligence reports and other communication errors", and juxtaposed the civilians killed in the Viscount shootdowns with those killed at Chikumbi.|$|E

He was joined on the grid's front row by Mears in his best qualifying performance of the season. Aric Almirola qualified third, his Dale Earnhardt, Inc. teammate Regan Smith was fourth, and Paul Menard started fifth. Mike Wallace, Joe Nemechek, Tony Raines, Vickers and Martin Truex Jr. rounded out the top ten qualifiers. Of the other drivers in the Chase, Edwards was twelfth, Burton 17th and Johnson 20th. The two drivers that failed to qualify were Sam Hornish Jr. and Patrick Carpentier.

In front of 7,247 at the MGM, Cotto defeated Mayorga via TKO in the 12th round, retaining his WBA light middleweight title. Throughout the fight, Mayorga looked to engage, however the discipline on Cotto played a big part in the win, saving his big shots for the final round. A left hook ended, which dropped Mayorga ended the bout. At the time of stoppage, Cotto was ahead by five points on all three judges scorecards. With the win, Cotto's record for world title fights improved to (17-2). Cotto earned $1 million from the fight and compubox stats showed that Cotto out punched Mayorga 249 to 176 in total punches.

500|$|Discussing the {{apparent}} {{failure of the}} cinematic universe's first team-up film, , to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Todd VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like [...] "showrunner" [...] in Feige, [...] "the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate", the DCEU has director Zack Snyder, whose DC films [...] "seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but {{a long series of}} teases for other ones. It's like he knows {{what he needs to do}} but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled." [...] Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to [...] "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" [...] and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the Justice League films, on top of Johns' involvement in several [...] "solo" [...] films, such as the post-production process of Suicide Squad or the writing process of a standalone Batman film. After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating, [...] "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn’t make sense, but there’s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you’ll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who’s creating them."

500|$|Eileen Lulevitch, {{entertainment}} reviewer for TV Guide, {{was generally}} favorable of the episode, writing, [...] "Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming {{an old friend}} back into your home. It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> all of the amazing moments that make this show {{so much fun to}} watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." [...] Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to {{a whole new set of}} interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots." ...|$|E
