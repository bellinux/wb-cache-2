Symbolic approaches derive their efficiency by exploiting high-level structure and regularity in the models {{to which they are}} applied, increasing the size of the state spaces which can be tackled. In general, this is done by using data structures which provide compact storage but which <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>efficient</b> to manipulate, usually based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs) or their extensions. In this paper we focus on BDDs, multi-valued decision diagrams (MDDs), multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDDs) and matrix diagrams. ...|$|R

Our method is based on the combination of two energy-based features and one new feature related to the frequency stability of a howling component.

The evaluation, carried out on a large database, showed that thealgorithm is able to detect both pure and multiple tones howling {{in a wide range of}} energy.

The broad-band SED cannot be explained by a one-zone model, and especially fails in the TeV domain. An extended jet has been detected on arcsec scales both in radio and X-ray frequencies. The spectral index of the X-ray band indicates an inverse Compton origin. Using an IC/CMB model, the TeV emission can be successfully modeled as originating in the extended jet. Several arguments in favor of this model, as well as observational tests, will be presented.

In Figure 11 d, Min/Max ratio of FC-MAC is approximately 0.827 even when the channel error is severe and the number of nodes is 32. As shown in Figure 11 b,e, the FC-MAC is better than the other algorithms in terms of fairness. Figure 11 c,f plot the aggregate throughputs of DCF, Idle sense, Optimal CW, and FC-MAC for different BER values.
