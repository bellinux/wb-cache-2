50|$|<b>Flash</b> <b>bracketing</b> is a {{technique}} of working with electronic flash, especially when used as fill flash in combination with existing light, maintaining the overall amount of exposure. The amount of light provided by the flash is varied in a bracketed series {{in order to find}} the most pleasing combination of ambient light and fill flash. If used for this purpose, <b>flash</b> <b>bracketing</b> can be differentiated from normal exposure <b>bracketing</b> via <b>flash,</b> although the usage of the term is not strict.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether {{repetitive}} opening and closure of self-ligating <b>bracket</b> <b>clips</b> can cause plastic deformation of the clip. METHODS: Three types of active/interactive ceramic self-ligating brackets (n = 20) were tested: In-Ovation C, Quicklear and WOW. A standardized controlled device performed 500 cycles of opening and closure movements of the <b>bracket</b> <b>clip</b> with proper instruments and techniques adapted as recommended by the manufacturer of each bracket type. Two tensile tests, one before and one after the repetitive cycles, were performed to assess the stiffness of the clips. To this end, a custom-made stainless steel 0. 40 x 0. 40 mm wire was inserted into the bracket slot and adapted to the universal testing machine (EMIC DL 2000), after which measurements were recorded. On the loading portion of the loading-unloading curve of clips, the slope fitted a first-degree equation curve to determine the stiffness/deflection rate of the clip. RESULTS: The results of plastic deformation showed no significant difference among bracket types before and after the 500 cycles of opening and closure (p = 0. 811). There were significant differences on stiffness among the three types of brackets (p = 0. 005). The WOW bracket had higher mean values, whereas Quicklear bracket had lower values, regardless of the opening/closure cycle. CONCLUSION: Repetitive controlled opening and closure movements of the clip did not alter stiffness or cause plastic deformation...|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, if {{the amount}} of flash light cannot be altered easily (for example with studio flashes), it is also {{possible}} to alter the aperture instead, however, this will also affect the depth of field and ambient light exposure. If the flash to ambient light ratio is to be changed in <b>flash</b> <b>bracketing</b> using this technique, it is necessary to counter-shift the shutter speed as well {{in order to maintain the}} level of ambient light exposure, however, with focal plane shutters, this is often difficult to achieve given their limited X-sync speed - and flash techniques such as high-speed synchronization are not available with studio flashes.|$|R

50|$|Light sensitivity: On {{sunny days}} {{the light is}} usually too intense for the camera which has a minimum {{aperture}} of f 8 and a minimum exposure time of 1/1000 second. It is necessary to add a polarizing filter of 3 f stops equivalent density (or a neutral density filter,) and this requires an adapter which extends the lens housing beyond the most extreme travel of the zoom lens. This adapter is available {{as part of a}} wide angle lens kit which while sold mainly for the Panasonic DMC-LC5, fiits the Digilux 1.

50|$|The RWR {{can be an}} {{important}} tool for evading threats if avoidance has failed. For example, if a SAM system or enemy fighter aircraft has fired a missile (for example, a SARH-guided missile) at the aircraft, the RWR may be able to detect the change in mode that the radar must use to guide the missile and notify the pilot with much more insistent warning tones and <b>flashing,</b> <b>bracketed</b> symbols on the RWR display. The pilot then can take evasive action to break the missile lock-on or dodge the missile. The pilot may even be able to visually acquire the missile after being alerted to the possible launch. What's more, if an actively guided missile is tracking the aircraft, the pilot can use the direction and distance display of the RWR to work out which evasive maneuvers to perform to outrun or dodge the missile. For example, the rate of closure and aspect of the incoming missile may allow the pilot to determine that if they dive away from the missile, it is unlikely to catch up, or if it is closing fast, {{that it is time to}} jettison external supplies and turn toward the missile in an attempt to out-turn it. The RWR may be able to send a signal to another defensive system on board the aircraft, such as a Countermeasure Dispensing System (CMDS), which can eject countermeasures such as chaff, to aid in avoidance.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{influence}} of resistance to sliding on expression of superelastic properties of NiTi wires. Methods and Materials. A three-point bending test was performed for 0. 014 NiTi wire engaged in self-ligating (Damon, SmartClip, In-Ovation) and conventional brackets (Victory) ligated with regular and reduced friction modules (Slide). The wire was deflected in the buccal direction and allowed to straighten. The maximum load, unloading plateau and unloading capacity were registered. Results. The lowest activation load was required in the active self-ligating group (In-Ovation 2. 2 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 4 &#x 2009;N) and reduced friction module group (Victory/Slide 2. 9 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 4 &#x 2009;N), followed by the passive self-ligating systems (Damon 3. 6 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 7 &#x 2009;N, SmartClip 3. 7 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 4 &#x 2009;N).

40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: To {{evaluate}} the frictional forces generated by five different orthodontic brackets {{when used in}} combination with stainless steel and NiTi archwires in dry conditions at physiological temperature. Approach: Five different types of maxillary canine brackets (Damon 3 MX, Step, Quick, Sprint, Mini Mono) with a slot size 0. 022 inch were coupled with 0. 016 ” and 0. 019 ”× 0. 025 ” stainless steel and with 0. 016 ” and 0. 018 ”× 0. 025 ” NiTi archwires. Step, Sprint and Mini Mono were used both with traditional ligatures and with Slide ligatures. A total of 320 archwires and brackets were used; ten tests were carried out for each group of bracket-wire combination at physiological temperature and in dry state. Frictional forces were measured by Instron Universal Testing Machine. The statistical significance level was established at P< 0. 05. Results: Damon 3 MX and Step brackets with Slide ligatures produced statistically lower friction than Quick and conventional brackets with elastomeric ligature. Frictional force increased proportionally to the wire size; NiTi archwires presented higher frictional resistance than stainless steel archwires. Slide ligatures showed lower fictional values in comparison with elastic ligatures.

40|$|Self-ligating {{brackets}} (SLBs) {{was introduced}} by Stolzenberg in the early 1930 s. Many SLBs systems have been patented since then, but few {{have been put on}} the market. Since SLBs have reduced friction and hence less force needed to produce tooth movement, they are proposed to have the potential advantages of producing more physiologically harmonious tooth movement. Here a case series of patients treated with SLBs is performed to verify the efficiency, effectiveness, and stability of treatment. Eighteen patients (8 females and 10 males, median age 19 ± 9. 2 years, min 10, max 39 years) affected by malocclusion were enrolled in this retrospective study. There were 8 class 1, 5 class 2 and 5 class 3 malocclusion, 3 cross-bites and 2 open-bite. Orthodontic treatment was performed by using 3 MUnitek Smart <b>Clip</b> <b>Brackets.</b> Lateral teleradiographic projections of the cranium were used. The cephalometric analysis was performed by using Dolphin Imaging System McLaughlin Cephalometric Analisys. Several variables related to teeth position were investigated.

40|$|Solospun is a {{spinning}} technology which provides {{the means to}} produce a singles yarn that can be successfully woven as either warp or weft. The technology is a versatile and cost effective alternative to two-folding, Sirospun or sizing. It offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity. Solospun is a simple, inexpensive, clip-on attachment for the spinning of long staple, weavable singles yarns. The technology {{is the result of}} a joint development between CSIRO Textile and Fibre Technology, The Woolmark Company and WRONZ and was commercially released in 1998. It is now successfully operating in worsted mills worldwide. The Solospun hardware consists of a pair of rollers held in a <b>bracket,</b> which is <b>clipped</b> onto the front of the pendulum-drafting arm. Each roller is positioned immediately below, and parallel to, each top front draft roller where it interacts with the emerging drafted fibre strand before twist insertion. The roller-fibre interaction subtly changes the structure of the yarn, which dramatically increases its abrasion resistance. This allows Solospun yarns to be woven without two-folding or sizing, providing significant cost savings. Depending on fabric structure, weaving performance is equivalent to that of conventional two-fold yarns. Fabrics woven from Solospun yarns are of good quality and appearance. Some aspects, including preferred hand and FAST results, are equal or superior to two-fold yarn fabrics. As with compact and condensed spinning, Solospun offers significant reductions in yarn hairiness. However, Solospun can be simply implemented on existing spinning frames and goes much further by making the singles yarns weavable...|$|R

A number of studies have evaluated the frictional characteristics of different self-ligating brackets but there have been only few studies which have actually evaluated their clinical efficiency. The present study was done to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of three contemporary selfligating <b>bracket</b> systems (Smart <b>Clip,</b> Damon 2, In-Ovation). Materials and methods: This was a prospective in vivo study in which a total of 18 patients were randomly divided into three groups treated with Smart Clip, Damon 2 and In-Ovation bracket systems. The total treatment time and the number of appointments required to complete the treatment were recorded. As a measure of quality of treatment, the ABO scores were measured at the end of treatment from the post-treatment dental casts and OPG. Results: The average time taken for the completion of treatment in Smart Clip, Damon 2, and In-Ovation group was 14. 0 ± 2. 6, 15. 3 ± 3. 2 and 17. 2 ± 3. 2 months respectively.
