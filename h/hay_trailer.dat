2500|$|... 10 September 2016. A {{passenger}} train {{was struck by}} a tractor pulling a heavily laden <b>hay</b> <b>trailer,</b> on occupation crossing number 10 (approximately half a mile north of Dymchurch station). Locomotive No 1 Green Goddess and its tender were both derailed and thrown onto their sides. The leading coach was also derailed but remained upright. The train driver and four passengers sustained minor injuries.|$|E
5000|$|A {{series of}} {{relatively}} newer Tatra trucks was {{offered in the}} 1980s and 1990s in plastic by Kaden, as were real Czech and Slovak production Zetor tractors which were often sold with <b>hay</b> <b>trailers,</b> with the tractor sometimes motorized with a simple remote control. Some of the trucks offered were delightful choices for miniature reproduction like the Tatra 815 in Paris-Dakar rally form or detailed diecast 815 dump truck with working suspension, tipping bed, tilting cabin, and two sets of steering wheels. Another 815 was a foam sprayer fire truck and another a [...] "Kaden African Expedition" [...] truck with trailer. Probably the most compelling Kaden Tatra 815 was the GTC ("Grand Touring Caravan") which in 1987, (while Czechoslovakia was still communist) was driven by a crew over 200,000 kilometers across six continents and through sixty-seven countries (Zikmund 2011). The huge Tatra was colorfully decorated in [...] "Tatra Around the World" [...] paint and had large windows {{on the front and}} sides of the box. The pressed tin miniature faithfully replicated the real truck, with window tampos, accurate colors and the many sponsors {{on the sides of the}} truck. This same 'big box' Tatra was also done as a large ambulance. One Tatra website also displayed an equally startling 815 - a Tatra car carrier handsomely filled with three non-Kaden T600 1938 Tatraplans (Rawicz 1996).|$|R
