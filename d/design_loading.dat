Nevertheless, for 8 % of design loads considered, significantly lower mass (> 10 %) designs are achieved with standard angle plies when designing directly for uncertain loading. Expansion of the ply envelope to include designs with continuous angles (0 ° ≤ θ ≤ 180 °) under an uncertain loading allows maximum mass savings up to 16 % over current design practice. However, when designing directly for an uncertain loading, no significant mass reductions are achieved through the use of continuous angles...|$|E

The methods for the <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> have been proposed by many famous classification societies rules. In this paper the methods of the <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> from the native existing classification societies rules and foreign rules were studied, and based on these rules, the <b>design</b> <b>loads</b> of a warship were obtained. Meanwhile, segment model self propulsion tests of this ship were performed in heading waves in the seakeeping tank to confirm the design values. Comparisons of calculation of classification societies rules with experimental data were also conducted and results were summarized in this paper.

40|$|To {{estimate}} the durability {{and reliability of}} a structural component its <b>design</b> <b>loading</b> spectrum must be defined. This spectrum is obtained by combining the loading spectra that correspond to all possible operating conditions. It can happen, however, {{that some of the}} loading spectra that should be used for building the <b>design</b> <b>loading</b> spectrum are not measured as a result of cost and time limitations. But if a relationship between the operating conditions and the corresponding loading spectra was known, it wouldbe possible to predict a loading spectrum for an arbitrary combination ofoperating conditions. In this paper, we present a new approach that makes itpossible to empirically model the relationship between the factors of the operating conditions and the corresponding loading spectra. This approach is based on a localised basis function neural network, and we have applied it on simulated and measured load states. The presented examples demonstrate that the new approach is suitable for predicting loading spectra for those combinations of operating conditions for which the load states were not measured...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{could accept}} onsite {{wastewater}} at rates {{two to three}} orders of magnitude higher than the current <b>design</b> <b>loading</b> rates if a clogging mat at the wastewater infiltration surface was limited or not present. The clogging mat controls system <b>design,</b> <b>loading</b> rate and life. Maintaining aerobic conditions at the wastewater infiltration surface could substantially reduce or eliminate clogging. This project is studying soil oxygen supply to the zone of clogging in soil. A model based on a form of Fick’s Law for diffusive transport is being applied to oxygen diffusion to the wastewater infiltration surface. Gas filled porosity controlled by soil characteristics of texture, structure, consistence and water content {{as well as the}} distance to the supply of oxygen and rate of oxygen consumption control the flux, F, of oxygen. If the oxygen consumption rate exceeds the maximum flux of soil oxygen then the soil infiltration surface will become anaerobic. To maximize delivery of oxygen, soil components should be shallow, narrow and have separated infiltration areas. Using models that incorporate system depth, geometry, and oxygen diffusion coefficients in soil, efficient loading rates can be estimated. Design of wastewater infiltration surfaces should be based o...|$|E
40|$|The {{durability}} {{and reliability of}} a structural component are usually estimated {{on the basis of}} its <b>design</b> <b>loading</b> spectrum, which is a combination of the loading spectra that correspond to various operating conditions. However, if some of the loading spectra that should be used to build the <b>design</b> <b>loading</b> spectrum were not measured, because of cost and time limitations, they must be determined in another way. In order to predict the missing loading spectra a relationship between the operating conditions and the corresponding loading spectra must be known. We showed previously that it is possible to estimate this relationship using a localised basis function neural network. However, with the localised basis function neural network only discrete loading spectra can be predicted and an extrapolation outside the domain of the known operating conditions is impossible. To avoid these problems we have developed a new approach for predicting the loading spectra. It is based on a combined multilayer perceptron neural network. This new approach enables the prediction of smoothed loading spectra and does not impose any restrictions on their extrapolation. In this paper we present the theoretical background to this new approach and then apply it to examples of simulated and measured load states...|$|E
40|$|The common {{wisdom is}} to design {{cladding}} and components using {{a lower level}} wind load than the main structural frames, i. e. a shorter recurrence period wind load is used for cladding design than for frame design. This paper first discusses the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> levels for structural frames and for cladding and components. Next, the <b>design</b> wind <b>loads</b> of scaffolds for building construction, those of buildings in the construction stage, and those of so-called “temporary” structures such as site offices are discussed. In Japan, the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> for scaffolds is defined as 1 -year-recurrence wind load, because its average setting period at one construction site is around 6 months, but this paper clearly proves the inappropriateness of this <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> estimation concept.

Finally, even for the <b>design</b> wind <b>load</b> for main structural frames, it is clearly demonstrated that the <b>design</b> <b>load</b> level {{may not be able to}} be determined based on the lifetime of an individual building. Therefore, although the LCC concept is applied in <b>design</b> <b>load</b> estimation, it is strongly recommended that the optimal <b>design</b> <b>load</b> level should be decided considering total LCC for the city or nation as a whole, and treat design as involving a group of buildings, rather than attempting to optimize the LCC of individual buildings.
