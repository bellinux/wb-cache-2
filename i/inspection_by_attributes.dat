40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we shall {{deal with the}} AOQL single {{sampling}} plans when the remainder of rejected lots is inspected. We shall consider two types of AOQL plans – for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables, and for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables and <b>attributes</b> (all items from the sample are inspected by variables, remainder of rejected lots is inspected <b>by</b> <b>attributes)</b> – see Klufa (1997). These plans we shall compare with the corresponding Dodge-Romig AOQL plans <b>by</b> <b>attributes.</b> From the results of numerical investigations it follows (see Klufa (2008)) that under the same protection of consumer the AOQL plans for <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> variables are in many situations more economical than the corresponding Dodge-Romig attribute sampling plans (saving of the inspection cost is 70 % in any cases). The calculation of these new plans is considerably difficult (in Klufa (2008) is only approximate solution).

Various procedures for the selection of conventional single sampling by attributes have been developed and are available in the literature. This paper presents a design methodology and tables for the selection of parameters of single sampling plans for specified requirements (strengths) under the conditions of a gamma prior and Poisson sampling distribution.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis recommends certain {{changes in the}} procedures and formatting of Military Standard 414 (Sampling Procedure and Tables for Inspection by Variable for Percent Defective) to bring its presentation in parallel with Military Standard 105 D (Sampling Procedures and Tables for <b>Inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>Attributes)</b> {{and to make the}} variables standard easier to use. The procedural changes involve eliminating the Form 1 procedure of the present standard and eliminating the average range method of estimating the lot standard deviation. The format changes involve relabeling the inspection levels, regrouping the lot size ranges, and relabeling the sample size code letters. Additions to the switching procedure for tightened and reduced inspection are also suggested. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|To {{avoid that}} {{defective}} units reach downstream production stages and cause {{a considerable amount}} of costs, quality control steps must be implemented. However, quality control steps cause further costs. Implemented sampling inspections are an opportunity to check the quality of lots within the production. In order to keep the costs to a minimum, the production planning must determine sample plans which incur the lowest costs. Due to the high number of different parameters and possible sample plans, this determination is extremely complicated. In order to deal with this issue, a tool to determine the economically optimal sample plan for destructive and nondestructive sampling <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>attributes</b> was developed. This paper describes the development of the tool as well as the procedure of the tool. The development is based on various sampling inspection related key figures and the international standard ISO 2859...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A dynamic {{approach}} to the Bayesian theory of sampling <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>attributes</b> for the single sampling case is presented. A model is developed which assumes a sequence of lots of equal known size and lots generated by a process operating in a random manner. The model also assumes constant associated costs for all lots and that the posterior distribution of the process quality of a given lot becomes the prior distribution of the process quality of the next lot. This allows the information from one lot {{to be used in}} the decision making for subsequent lots. The model is formulated by using a mixed binomial distribution with beta weights as the prior distribution of the lot quality. An improved algorithm for the solution of the single lot case, bounds for the optimal sample size, a lower bound for the expected cost of sampling for the single lot case and a lower bound for the expected cost for the sequence of lots are presented. Optimality conditions for the non-sampling alternatives, the 100...|$|E
40|$|An {{integral}} part of the MIL-STD- 105 D scheme for sampling <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>attributes</b> is the transfer from normal inspection to reduced or tightened inspection when the historical record of inspected lots suggests unusually good or bad quality. The switching rules in MIL-STD- 105 D have been criticized, especially by Japanese manufacturers, as being too severe when what is defined as acceptable quality material is submitted. This paper examines the long range fraction of lots rejected for several MIL-STD- 105 D sampling plans by using the MIL-STD- 105 D switching rules, using a modification suggested by the Japanese Standards Association, and by using a second modification developed by the authors. The Japanese Standards Association switching rules are more complex than those in MIL-STD- 105 D. It is demonstrated that they lead to improved long-range properties for Normal-Tightened-Reduced schemes, but to poorer properties for Normal-Tightened schemes. A simplified set of switching rules is suggested, wherein the “limit numbers” in MIL-STD- 105 D are eliminated. In comparison to MIL-STD- 105 D, the simpler rules lead to a lower probability of rejection for good lots and a comparable probability of rejection for bad lots...|$|E
40|$|HYPERSAMP is a {{demonstration}} of an attribute sampling system developed to determine the minimum sample size required for any preselected value for consumer's risk and fraction of nonconforming. This statistical method {{can be used in}} place of MIL-STD- 105 E sampling plans when a minimum sample size is desirable, such as when tests are destructive or expensive. HYPERSAMP utilizes the Hypergeometric Distribution and can be used for any fraction nonconforming. The program employs an iterative technique that circumvents the obstacle presented by the factorial of a non-whole number. HYPERSAMP provides the required Hypergeometric sample size for any equivalent real number of nonconformances in the lot or batch under evaluation. Many currently used sampling systems, such as the MIL-STD- 105 E, utilize the Binomial or the Poisson equations as an estimate of the Hypergeometric when performing <b>inspection</b> <b>by</b> <b>attributes.</b> However, this is primarily because of the difficulty in calculation of the factorials required by the Hypergeometric. Sampling plans based on the Binomial or Poisson equations will result in the maximum sample size possible with the Hypergeometric. The difference in the sample sizes between the Poisson or Binomial and the Hypergeometric can be significant. For example, a lot size of 400 devices with an error rate of 1. 0 % and a confidence of 99 % would require a sample size of 400 (all units would need to be inspected) for the Binomial sampling plan and only 273 for a Hypergeometric sampling plan. The Hypergeometric results in a savings of 127 units, a significant reduction in the required sample size. HYPERSAMP is {{a demonstration}} program and is limited to sampling plans with zero defectives in the sample (acceptance number of zero). Since it is only a demonstration program, the sample size determination is limited to sample sizes of 1500 or less. The Hypergeometric Attribute Sampling System demonstration code is a spreadsheet program written for IBM PC compatible computers running DOS and Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 or Quattro Pro. This program is distributed on a 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS format diskette, and the program price includes documentation. This statistical method was developed in 1992...|$|E
