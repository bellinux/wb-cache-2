Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne were his most frequent collaborators on disc from 1939 to 1952—a partnership that produced four million-selling singles: Pistol Packin' Mama, Jingle Bells, Don't Fence Me In, and South America, Take it Away. They made one film appearance together in Road to Rio singing You Don't <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> <b>the</b> Language, and sang together countless times on radio shows throughout the 1940s and 1950s. They appeared as guests on each other's shows quite often, {{as well as on}} many shows for the Armed Forces Radio Service during and after World War II. The quartet's Top-10 Billboard hits from 1943 to 1945 including The Vict'ry Polka, There'll Be a Hot Time in the Town of Berlin (When the Yanks Go Marching In), and Is You Is or Is You Ain't (Ma' Baby?) were major morale-boosters for the American public during the war years.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street {{has used}} many writers in its long history. As Dave Connell, one of Sesame Streets {{original}} producers, has stated, {{it was difficult}} to find adults who could identify a preschooler's interest level. Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. Norman Stiles, head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would [...] "burn out" [...] after writing about a dozen scripts. According to Gikow, Sesame Street went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that {{it would be easier to}} teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy. As Stone stated, [...] "Writing for children is not so easy". Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, [...] "It's not an easy show to write. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt".|$|E
500|$|VA Deputy Undersecretary for Health Administrative Operations William Schoenhard wrote a memo on March 15, 2013 {{indicating}} that the VA was changing its performance measure for appointment wait times. The new goal involved measuring {{the number of days}} between a veteran's desired appointment date and the actual date of the appointment. A VA Office of the Medical Inspector report from December 2013 showed a dramatic change in March 2013 of the number of appointments booked within the 14-day window for the Ft. Collins, Colorado outpatient clinic. When investigators asked VA employees to explain [...] "what occurred in March 2013" [...] the employees said that [...] "they were instructed by Business office staff to access the appointment schedule, review it for capacity, inform the Veteran of schedule availability, and then enter the Desired Date as the patient appointment date" [...] and [...] "By entering the Desired Date as the appointment date, the wait time … appears to be zero days." [...] The Ft. Collins clinic is overseen by the Cheyenne, Wyoming, Veterans Affairs office. A coordinator at the Cheyenne office sent an email on June 19, 2013 with instructions on how to manipulate the appointment dates. The coordinator wrote, [...] "Yes, it is gaming the system a bit, but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> rules of the game you are playing.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Mobile phones {{can be used}} in {{countries}} with different emergency numbers. This means that a traveller visiting a foreign country does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> local emergency numbers. The mobile phone and the SIM card have a preprogrammed list of emergency numbers. When the user tries to set up a call using an emergency number known by a GSM or 3G phone, the special emergency call setup takes place. The actual number is not even transmitted into the network, but the network redirects the emergency call to the local emergency desk. [...] Most GSM mobile phones can dial emergency numbers even when the phone keyboard is locked, the phone is without a SIM card, emergency number is entered instead of the PIN or there isn't a network signal (busy network).|$|E

[...] "This is a {{monument}} where people go and visit on a daily basis," [...] said Dietrich who is spearheading restoration efforts. [...] "The nearly 80-year-old popular plot at the Machpelah Cemetery has fallen into disrepair over the years." [...] "The Houdini Museum has teamed with The Society of American Magicians, {{one of the oldest}} fraternal magic organizations in the world, to give the beloved site a facelift." [...] The organization has a specific Houdini gravesite committee made up of nine members headed up by President elect David Bowers who brought this project to the Society's attention. Kenrick [...] "Ice" [...] McDonald, the current president of the Society of American Magicians said [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> history. Houdini served as President from 1917 until his death in 1926. Houdini's burial site needs an infusion of cash to restore it to its former glory." [...] Magician Dietrich said the repairs could cost [...] "tens of thousands of dollars", after consulting with glass experts and grave artisans. [...] "It's a wonderful project, but it's taken a lifetime to get people interested," [...] she said. [...] "It's long overdue, and it's great that it's happening." [...] Houdini was a living superhero," [...] Dietrich said. [...] "He wasn't just a magician and escape artist, he was a great humanitarian." [...] To this day, the Society holds a broken wand ceremony at the grave every November.|$|E
