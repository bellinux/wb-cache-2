50|$|The XB-46's {{first flight}} {{occurred}} 2 April 1947 {{after a month}} of taxi testing, and lasted ninety minutes as the bomber departed the Convair plant in San Diego, California for Muroc Army Airfield in the high desert. The pilot praised its handling qualities. Basic flight testing took place for five months, and by September 1947 it was concluded after 127 hours aloft on 64 flights by both the Convair company and AAF test pilots. Stability and control were excellent but there were engineering problems with <b>engine</b> <b>de-icing,</b> the cabin air system, and vertical oscillations caused by harmonic resonance between the wing and spoilers. There was also concern regarding {{the ability of the}} three man crew to exit the aircraft in case of an emergency, since the exit plan relied on the pneumatic system to hold the main door open against the airstream. The aircraft was accepted on 7 November and delivered on 12 November 1947.|$|E
25|$|Model 90 with TOGW {{increased}} to 9300lb, two 550shp PT6A-20 engines, redesigned flightdeck {{and a new}} <b>engine</b> <b>de-ice</b> system, 206 built.|$|R
50|$|The A-37B added a {{refueling}} probe to the nose, leading to pipes {{wrapped around the}} lower lip of the canopy, for probe-and-drogue aerial refueling. This was an unusual fit for USAF aircraft, which traditionally are configured for boom refueling. Other improvements included updated avionics, a redesigned instrument panel to make the aircraft easier to fly from either seat, an automatic <b>engine</b> inlet <b>de-icing</b> system, and revised landing gear. Like its predecessors, the A-37B was not pressurized.|$|R
5000|$|The PC-12 {{incorporates}} numerous safety measures. The PT6A-67 engine has {{a reputation}} for considerable reliability, a factor that has reportedly been decisive to some prospective operators. To counteract stall and spin conditions, dual angle-of-attack sensors near the wingtips force the stick forwards in advance of a potential stall. For greater redundancy, the PC-12 NG has a complete split-bus dual electrical system as akin to modern jet aircraft, in addition to two separate batteries and a third emergency battery. The type is certified for flight into known ice conditions; as per standard fit, pneumatic de-icing systems are installed in the wings and empennage, while electrical de-icing measures are integrated into the windshield and exhaust heat is used for <b>engine</b> inlet <b>de-icing.</b> Aviation Week describe the PC-12 as possessing [...] "...comparatively slow take-off and landing speeds, excellent short-field performance, and easy handling characteristics." ...|$|R
50|$|Component Maintenance Department {{consists}} of seven Workshops, Engineering Production Bureau and Support Unit.Radio Workshop {{is responsible for}} maintenance of components from navigation, communications, microwaves and auto flight systems using automatic test equipment to perform more accurate troubleshooting and fault isolation.Instrument Workshop covers testing, repair and overhaul of various types of sensors, transmitters, indicators, Air Data Computers and Cabin Pressure Controllers. It also has capabilities for maintenance of gyroscopic instruments such as vertical and horizontal gyros. Complete maintenance and readout of Flight Data Recorders is performed in this workshop.Maintenance of oxygen bottles, crew and passenger oxygen masks together with Passenger Service Units (PSU) is responsibility of Oxygen Workshop which {{is a part of}} Instrument Workshop.Electric Workshop performs maintenance of various control boxes, relays, components from distribution system of electrical power, electrical starters and generators, electrical harnesses, fire detection sensors, batteries and other electrical units.Pneumatic Workshop is in charge of components from pneumatic, air-conditioning, pressurization, anti-icing, <b>de-icing,</b> <b>engine</b> bleed and engine starting systems.Hydraulic and Mechanical Components Workshop is divided in two parts. First part is responsible for maintenance of components from hydraulic, flight controls and fuel systems such as actuators, hydraulic modules and various types of pumps. Second part deals with gearboxes and other components from flight controls systems together with all types of fire extinguishers, command cables, pipes and hoses.Landing Gear workshop covers repair and maintenance of landing gears, wheels and brakes.Test Equipment and Calibration Workshop is responsible for maintenance and calibration of tools, equipment and test equipment. It has accreditation of national standard institutions and traceability to international standards.Support Unit provides logistics in documentation and materials flow in whole department.Engineering Production Bureau is responsible to provide engineering and technological support to workshops from Component Maintenance Department. Its duties are to keep maintenance of components in accordance of latest requirements of manufacturers and relevant authorities.|$|R
