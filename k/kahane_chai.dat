2500|$|Kach (...) was {{a radical}} Orthodox Jewish, ultranationalist {{political}} party in Israel, existing from 1971 to 1994. Founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane {{in the early}} 1970s, and following his Jewish nationalist-Orthodox ideology (subsequently dubbed Kahanism), the party entered the Knesset following the 1984 elections, after several electoral failures. However, it was barred from participating {{in the next election}} in 1988 under the revised Knesset Elections Law banning parties that incited racism. After Kahane's assassination in 1990, the party split, with <b>Kahane</b> <b>Chai</b> ( [...] , [...] "Kahane Lives") breaking away from the main Kach faction. The party was also barred from standing in the 1992 election, and both organisations were banned outright in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Following Kahane's death, no leader {{emerged to}} replace him in the movement, {{although}} the idea of transferring populations, mainly attributed to Kahane, was subsequently incorporated into the political platform of various political parties in Israel, such as Moledet (applying to Arab non-citizen residents of the West Bank) and Yisrael Beiteinu (in the form of population exchange). Two small Kahanist factions later emerged; one under the name Kach, and the other under the name <b>Kahane</b> <b>chai</b> (Hebrew: כהנא חי, literally [...] "Kahane lives [...] "), the second one was led by his younger son, Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane. Neither one was permitted to participate in the Knesset elections by the Central Elections Committee.|$|E

He then began spending weekends in Kfar Tapuach, an Orthodox West Bank settlement. During his national service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Natan-Zada deserted the army and hid in Kfar Tapuach to avoid further service. According to Matthew Gutman of the Jerusalem Post, Kfar Tapuach [...] "became the unofficial headquarters of the Jewish terrorist group <b>Kahane</b> <b>Chai</b> in 1990," [...] but supporters deny the existence of a Kahane headquarters.|$|E

Later the same month Zündel was the recipient of a parcel bomb that was detonated by the Toronto police bomb squad. In 2011, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had launched an investigation against at least nine members of the JDL in regards to an anonymous tip that the JDL was plotting to bomb the Palestine House in Mississauga.|$|E

50|$|Feiglin and Sackett {{established}} Zo Artzeinu in December 1993, {{after the}} Knesset of Israel banned the Kach party movement in Israel.

50|$|Just {{a couple}} of parties like Chayil and Kahanist groups {{actively}} promote this (Kahanists such as Kach and <b>Kahane</b> <b>Chai</b> advocate the abolition of secular democracy {{and the creation of}} a Halakhic state in its stead). In contrast, United Torah Judaism (UTJ) and Shas believe that a Jewish-run state is halakhically forbidden until the Messianic age (based on the Three Oaths). Therefore, the aspiration is essentially messianic, and they are not trying to implement it. Meimad is the only Jewish religious political party in Israel that actively opposes a Halachic state. The National Religious Party wishes to increase the Jewish religious character of the state incrementally by influencing individuals.|$|E

The FBI’s Mary Doran described the JDL in 2004 Congressional testimony as [...] "a proscribed terrorist group".

50|$|On February 25, 1994, Baruch Goldstein, an American-born Israeli physician, perpetrated the Cave of the Patriarchs {{massacre}} {{in the city}} of Hebron, Goldstein shot and killed between 30 and 54 Muslim worshippers inside the Ibrahimi Mosque (within the Cave of the Patriarchs), and wounded another 125 to 150. Goldstein, who was lynched and killed in the mosque, was a supporter of Kach, an Israeli political party founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane that advocated the expulsion of Arabs from Israel and the Palestinian Territories. In the aftermath of the Goldstein attack and Kach statements praising it, Kach was outlawed in Israel. Today, Kach and a breakaway group, <b>Kahane</b> <b>Chai,</b> are considered terrorist organisations by Israel, Canada, the European Union, and the United States.
