5|$|Although Z. Marcas {{features}} {{characters from}} other Balzac stories and elements of literary realism– both hallmarks of Balzac's style– it is remembered primarily for its political themes. Balzac, a legitimist, believed that France's lack of bold leadership {{had led to}} mediocrity and ruin, and that men of quality were being ignored or worse. He maintained that the youth of France were in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> abandoned by the government, and predicted unrest {{in the years to}} come.|$|E
5|$|At one point, {{the prices}} for his {{pictures}} were exceeded only {{by those of}} renowned English artists Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough. Despite his many commissions, however, Stuart was habitually neglectful of finances and was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> sent to debtors' prison. In 1787, he fled to Dublin, Ireland where he painted and accumulated debt with equal vigor.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of Highbury was {{restricted}} because the East Stand had been {{designated as a}} Grade II listed building {{and the other three}} stands were close to residential properties. These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> left behind in the football boom of that time.|$|E
50|$|Gertrude Hardy-Fenton's sister. She has a {{knack for}} solving cases, {{identical}} to her brother and though proud of him and her nephews' abilities, lectures them about <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> detectives.|$|R
25|$|She {{carefully}} ascribes {{the norms}} {{she describes as}} those of the 'world' rather than herself, but steps back from challenging them, by advising her daughters <b>of</b> the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> known for what you know.|$|R
5000|$|The Telegraph {{praised the}} film's pace; [...] "This French thriller hurtles along with hardly a pause...The <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> out <b>of</b> your depth in {{criminal}} dealings give Fred Cavayé's film plenty of pulse and urgency".|$|R
5|$|Humble {{continued}} {{as a member}} of the Marine Reserves as his professional career continued, and in 1951 he was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> called up for service in the Korean War. He re-enlisted in the summer and played for a military team at Marine Corps Base Quantico later in the year. After the season, he was named the best service player in the country by the Washington Touchdown Club.|$|E
5|$|By 13 August, the {{offensive}} had fully halted, with German forces being {{driven out of}} Mortain. The Germans had lost 120 tanks and assault guns to Allied counter-attacks and air strikes, {{more than two-thirds of}} their committed total. As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions, the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and north toward Argentan. The German attack west left the 7th Army and Panzergruppe West in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> encircled by Allied forces. As American forces advanced on Argentan, British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise, threatening to cut off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the change}} in Code Letters in 1934, Centaur was {{allocated}} the Code Letters GMQP. A highlight of Centaurs pre-war career was the rescue of the 385ton Japanese whale-chaser Kyo Maru II in November 1938. Kyo Maru II had developed boiler problems while returning from the Antarctic and was drifting towards the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, where she was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> wrecked by the reefs in the area. Centaur responded to the distress signal and towed Kyo Maru II to Geraldton.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} a {{single point of failure}} has also been applied to the fields of Intelligence. Edward Snowden talked <b>of</b> the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> what he {{described}} as [...] "the single point of failure" [...] - the sole repository of information.|$|R
50|$|He was {{a speaker}} {{at a conference}} {{on the role of}} {{photography}} in war zones; the conference was organized by the Italian Foundation of Photography and took place in Turin in April 2002.

Mr Spears, a scientist, {{works on}} a formula to bring his wife back to normal size. He also makes some special gadgets to help her out - {{but there are still}} <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> so small.|$|R
5|$|In December 1987, the Conservancy {{performed}} one of {{its first}} breed rescues when it removed a viable population of Santa Cruz sheep from Santa Cruz Island. The sheep were in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> eradicated by The Nature Conservancy, which was working to save indigenous vegetation that the breed used as food. The first twelve lambs {{were removed from the}} island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, which kept it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to adverse conditions.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr in Denmark {{that the}} Nazis {{considered}} {{his family to}} be Jewish, {{and that they were}} in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September 1943. When the news of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a telegram asking Bohr to come to Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC).|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton set {{the pace}} in Q2, seven-tenths of a second ahead of Rosberg. Kimi Räikkönen was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{eliminated}} {{for the majority of}} the session, as he spun while preparing for his first timed lap and then ran wide over the track limits on his second attempt, but managed to proceed into Q3 with his third fast lap. He initially demoted Fernando Alonso outside the top ten with his time, but the McLaren driver hit back with a time sufficient to move on. This left Magnussen, Daniil Kvyat, Gutiérrez, Romain Grosjean, Felipe Massa, and Sergio Pérez on the sidelines for Q3.|$|E
50|$|During the song, {{he compares}} women to {{chickens}} ("A rooster in a chicken coop is better off'n men, he ain't the special property {{of just one}} hen!") and tells <b>of</b> the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> caught flirting ("If you make one mistake when the moon is bright, then they tie you to a contract so you make it every night!").|$|R
50|$|The planet Mercury {{has often}} {{been used as a}} setting in science fiction. Recurring themes include the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> exposed to solar {{radiation}} and the possibility of escaping excessive radiation by staying within the planet's slow-moving terminator (the boundary between day and night). Another recurring theme is autocratic governments, perhaps because of an association of Mercury with hot-temperedness.|$|R
5000|$|Cadbury's {{objectives}} in Bournville were {{the construction of}} decent quality homes at prices affordable to industrial workers. The particulars stated that it was: [...] "intended {{to make it easy}} for working men to own houses with large gardens, secure from the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> spoilt either by factories, or by the interference with the enjoyment of sun, light and air".|$|R
5|$|Norgrove {{was removed}} from the scene via {{helicopter}} and received medical care, but she died. It was reported initially that she had been killed by one of her captors setting off a suicide vest. According to The Guardian, insurgents often put on suicide vests if they think they are in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> attacked. Taliban commanders Mullah Basir and Mullah Keftan (who were holding Norgrove) were among those killed in the raid, according to an Afghan intelligence official. Other women and children in the compound were uninjured, and no members of the rescue team were wounded.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 1944 a train {{carrying}} 700 men on Schindler's {{list was}} initially {{sent to the}} concentration camp at Gross-Rosen, where the men spent about a week before being re-routed to the factory in Brünnlitz. Three hundred female Schindlerjuden were similarly sent to Auschwitz, where they were in imminent <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> sent to the gas chambers. Schindler's usual connections and bribes failed to obtain their release. Finally after he sent his secretary, Hilde Albrecht, with bribes of black market goods, food and diamonds, the women were sent to Brünnlitz after several harrowing weeks in Auschwitz.|$|E
5|$|On 17 August 1944, Model {{received}} from Hitler Diamonds {{to go with}} his Knight's Cross with Oakleaves and Swords, in reward for his shoring up of the Eastern Front. Simultaneously, he {{was transferred to the}} west, replacing Kluge as commander-in-chief of Army Group B and OB West. The front in Normandy had collapsed after nearly two months of severe fighting, the U.S. Third Army was driving for the Seine, and an Army group was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> annihilated in the Falaise pocket.|$|E
25|$|Civilian {{crimes against}} Germans or German {{property}} {{were supposed to}} be referred to the German police, many instances were overlooked at some risk to the policemen involved. Some Police gave out verbal warnings <b>of</b> the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> caught. In 1942, 18 Guernsey police officers were tried before the German military court for stealing or receiving foodstuffs and wood from a German military store.|$|R
50|$|His {{father was}} a {{baseball}} player for a company's team. During World War II, No supported Japan and considered becoming a kamikaze pilot, but his {{father was a}}damantly against it. No's support for Imperial Japan waned and he became pro-American, though he had to hide his pro-Americanism due to the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> recognized as <b>being</b> an admirer <b>of</b> the U.S. in northern Korea at the time.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> far more distracted from or unable to distinguish reality than with other drugs and retaining a truly fragmented dissociation from regular consciousness without being immobilized, the anticholinergics are toxic, carry {{the risk of death}} by overdose, and also include a number of uncomfortable side effects. These side effects usually include dehydration and mydriasis (dilation of the pupils).|$|R
5|$|On the division's right, Tabu-dong was in North Korean hands, on {{the left}} Waegwan was a no-man's land, {{and in the center}} strong North Korean forces were infiltrating southward from Hill 518. The 7th Cavalry Regiment in the center could no longer use the Waegwan-Tabu-dong lateral supply road behind it, and was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> surrounded. After {{discussing}} a withdrawal plan with Walker, on September 5 Gay issued an order for a general withdrawal of the 1st Cavalry Division during the night to shorten the lines and to occupy a better defensive position.|$|E
5|$|Raw {{subsequently}} {{served in}} staff and diplomatic roles until 1965, {{when he took}} command of No. 82 Wing. Between May 1966 and April 1967, he served as the air support coordinator for the Australian forces in South Vietnam; his initial refusal to commit RAAF helicopters to assist the Australian Army force that was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> defeated during the Battle of Long Tan in August 1966 generated lasting controversy. Raw served in various staff and training positions until 1972, when he was appointed the commander of RAAF Base Butterworth. He returned to Australia in 1976 and retired from the RAAF two years later.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that his}} ships were in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{caught by the}} much larger British ships of the line, Captain Beens gave orders for the {{squadron}} to separate. Gentille and Fraternité splitting from Gloire to the west with the ships of the line HMS Hannibal and HMS Robust in close pursuit while Gloire swung northwest, eluding most of the British squadron except for the 32-gun frigate HMS Astraea under Captain Lord Henry Paulet, which managed to stay in contact throughout the afternoon.|$|E
50|$|The Dunkin' Save {{continued}} into the semifinals, with the three acts in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> elimination <b>being</b> those voted in 4th, 5th, and 6th place.|$|R

50|$|The {{promontory}} of Sagres {{has always}} been important for sailors because it offers a shelter for ships before attempting the dangerous voyage around Cape St. Vincent (could be Belixe Bay, between Sagres Point and the Cape, or Sagres Bay, to the east). Given the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> blown onto the coastal rocks, captains preferred {{to wait in the}} lee of the point until favourable winds allowed them to continue.|$|R
5|$|The {{meetings}} of the Puerto Rican Independence movement which met in St. Thomas were discovered by the Spanish authorities {{and the members of}} the movement were either imprisoned or exiled. In a letter dated October 1, 1824, which Venezuelan rebel leader José María Rojas sent to María de las Mercedes Barbudo, Rojas stated that the Venezuelan rebels had lost their principal contact with the Puerto Rican Independence movement in the Danish island of Saint Thomas and therefore the secret communication which existed between the Venezuelan rebels and the leaders of the Puerto Rican independence movements was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> discovered.|$|E
5|$|The move 6.Nf3 {{controls}} the e5-square {{in order to}} prepare the push f4–f5. Unlike after 5...Nec6, White {{does not have to}} fear 6...Bc5?!, which encounters difficulties after 7.f5! Nh4 8.Ng5!, when the black knight is already in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> lost to Qd1–g4 or Qd1–h5. Instead Black must react quickly with 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6/0-0/Nc6/b6 or act boldly with 7...Qf6 threatening both the Nc3 and the f4-pawn. One point in favour of 7...Qf6 is that after 8.e5 Qb6 the black queen prevents White from castling short and is well placed if White castles long.|$|E
5|$|Under {{common law}} tradition, civilians could possess {{firearms}} except artillery and insidious weapons (e.g. firearms that had appearance of other objects, etc.). First gun control laws were enacted during early 18th century {{and dealt with}} illegal use of firearms for poaching. At the time, hunting was an exclusive noble privilige with little to no legal option for participation of common folk. Despite tough sentences of 12 years of hard labor or death introduced by a 1727 enactment, poaching with use of firearms remained widespread {{to the point that}} a 1732 Royal Gamekeeping Rules noted that gamekeepers were in constant <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> shot by poachers.|$|E

"The Mongolian People’s Party will aim to {{eliminate}} all brutal enemies harmful {{to the state and}} the religion; to re-gain the lost rights; to vigorously enhance the state and the religion; to regard the deeds for the sake of poor and vulnerable people as the supreme mission; to uphold long-lasting nature of internal affairs; and to create a living free from <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> oppressed and oppressing others." ...|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of other celebrities, Pasquale backed the Man Alive 2005 campaign. The campaign, which was run by Cancer Research UK, aimed to alert men to the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> {{overweight}} and to encourage exercise. The main danger highlighted by the campaign was that obesity and physical inactivity can cause cancer in men, and that the cancer caused by obesity may be prevented by a healthy diet and regular exercise.|$|R
