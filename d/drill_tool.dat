5000|$|The Indus Valley Civilization {{has yielded}} {{evidence}} of dentistry being practiced {{as far back}} as 7000 BC. This earliest form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead craftsmen. The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective. Cavities of 3.5 mm depth with concentric groovings indicate use of a <b>drill</b> <b>tool.</b> The age of the teeth has been estimated at 9000 years. In later times, mechanical hand drills were used. Like most hand drills, they were quite slow, with speeds of up to 15 rpm. In 1864, British dentist George Fellows Harrington invented a clockwork dental drill named Erado. [...] The device was much faster than earlier drills, but also very noisy. In 1868, American dentist George F. Green came up with a pneumatic dental drill powered with pedal-operated bellows. James B. Morrison devised a pedal-powered burr drill in 1871.|$|E
50|$|The user {{sits at the}} Dextroscope 3D {{interaction}} {{console and}} manipulates the Virtual Patient using both hands {{in a similar manner}} to how one would manipulate a real object. Using stereoscopic visualisations displayed via a mirror, the Dextroscope user sees the Virtual Patient floating behind the mirror but within easy reach of the hands and uses flexible 3D hand movements to rotate and manipulate the object of interest. The Dextroscope allows virtual segmentation of organs and structures, making accurate 3D measurements, etc.In one hand the user holds an ergonomically shaped handle with a switch that, when pressed, allows the 3D image to be moved freely {{as if it were an}} object held in real space. The other hand holds a pencil shaped stylus that is used to select tools from a virtual control panel and perform detailed manipulations and operations on the 3D image. The user does not see the stylus, handle or his/her hands directly, as they are hidden behind the surface of the mirror. Instead he/she sees a virtual handle and stylus calibrated to appear in exactly the same position as the real handle and stylus. The business end of the virtual handle can be selected to be anything that the software can create - <b>drill</b> <b>tool,</b> measurement tool, cutter, etc. Experience has shown that it is unnecessary to model the user's hands, provided that he/she can see and feel the real tools and that these perceptions match the virtual scene. This is highly advantageous since the hands would otherwise clutter the workspace and obscure the view of the object of interest.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an impact dynamic {{analysis of a}} percussive system based on rotary-percussive ultrasonic drill (RPUD). The RPUD employs vibrations on two sides of one single piezoelectric stack to achieve rotary-percussive motion, which improves drilling efficiency. The RPUD’s percussive system is composed of a percussive horn, a free mass, and a <b>drill</b> <b>tool.</b> The percussive horn enlarges longitudinal vibration from piezoelectric stack and delivers the vibration to the <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> through the free mass, which forms the percussive motion. Based on the theory of conservation of momentum and Newton’s impact law, collision process of the percussive system under no-load condition is analyzed to establish the collision model between the percussive horn, the free mass, and the <b>drill</b> <b>tool.</b> The collision model shows that free mass transfers high-frequency small-amplitude vibration of percussive horn into low-frequency large-amplitude vibration of <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> through impact. As an important parameter of free mass, the greater {{the weight of the}} free mass, the higher the kinetic energy obtained by <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> after collision. High-speed camera system and drilling experiments are employed to validate the inference results of collision model by using a prototype of the RPUD...|$|E

Vibrations of the <b>drilling</b> <b>tool</b> caused by changing cutting forces, based on form and position errors of a pilot hole, affects the drilling quality. Within the project IntiBo fundamental mechatronic and control insights on the integration of adaptronic components are being developed by the Fraunhofer IPT exemplified by a <b>drilling</b> <b>tool.</b> Such components contribute {{to the fact that the}} vibrations of the tool and machine structure are compensated, as well as form and position errors in the work piece are minimized. The construction of <b>drilling</b> <b>tool</b> enables the use of different adaptronic positioning systems. An integrated sensor actor system in the top of the <b>drilling</b> <b>tool</b> guarantee a highly dynamic radial drooping of the cutting edge. The surface of the drilling hole can thereby be structured with a maximum drooping frequency of several hundred hertz or a maximum stroke of 130 urn. Form and position errors of the work piece are compensated by three radially adjustable guiding pads, which are positioned with an offset of 120 on the circumference of the <b>drilling</b> <b>tool.</b> A third positioning system at the <b>drilling</b> <b>tool</b> body is used for active vibration damping of the tool structure. Based on an intelligent combination of different sensor actor systems, the precision of the machine tool can be clearly improved in relation to surface quality and geometrical accuracy of the work piece.

30|$|Research on lunar {{regolith}} {{can enhance}} knowledge regarding lunar regolith composition and planetary history [1, 2]. Drilling systems {{are widely used}} for extraterrestrial subsurface regolith sampling, because they are appropriate tools to acquire regolith samples while maintaining their stratification along the longitudinal direction [3 – 5]. The mission of Chang’e- 5 lunar exploration project aims to obtain lunar subsurface regolith through a drilling and coring device, {{and return it to}} the Earth. Though the mechanical properties of the lunar regolith obtained by the Soviet Union and the United States have been analyzed and reported in the literature, the regolith materials at a specific site are not known [6, 7]. The <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> should have operative performance to adapt to lunar regolith with different mechanical properties. Therefore, ground experiments must be conducted with the desired lunar regolith simulant to validate whether the <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> can obtain an appropriate sample [1, 8]. The modeling of the drill-simulant interaction simulates the drilling mechanism, which is used to predict drilling load, and represents a fundamental reference to eventually design an appropriate <b>drill</b> <b>tool</b> and develop a suitable drilling strategy [9].|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} the control of tool {{vibration}} {{has emerged as the}} critical area of scientific development. This is because tool vibration creates sound-noise and unwanted quality surface. Mathematically, the observed tool vibration is a ratio of the force acting on the tool to its dynamic stiffness. Because dynamic stiffness is strongly influence by tool damping, the tool vibration could be controlled by enhancing the damping ability of the tooling system. The Department of Production Engineering at KTH has designed new damped <b>drilling</b> <b>tools</b> which absorb the vibratory energy from machining. It is expected that they have better performances than the conventional <b>drilling</b> <b>tools.</b> In this paper, new <b>drilling</b> <b>tools</b> were tested and compared to conventional ones with Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) and Machining tests. The natural frequencies, the damping ratios, and mode shapes were detected. Also the <b>drilling</b> <b>tools</b> were tested while mounted in the damped clamping device and the conditional clamping device. Taguchi method was then conducted to find the optimal cutting parameters of each combination of the <b>drilling</b> <b>tool</b> and the clamping device. The EMA shows that the damped tools have higher damping ratio than the conventional one. In the machining test, damped tools also achieve better quality surface while mounted in the conventional clamp. The damped clamp helps the conventional tool improve the damping ratio significantly; however it does not give any improvement for the damped tool...|$|R
