5|$|The London Chess Club, which <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> with Staunton and his colleagues, {{organised}} {{a tournament}} that was played {{a month later}} and had a multi-national set of players (many of whom had competed in Staunton's tournament), {{and the result was}} the same – Anderssen won.|$|E

He replaced Manstein, who <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of favour with Hitler. Despite Manstein's previous victories, the Führer wanted someone whom he anticipated would be unyielding in defence.|$|E

5|$|The road {{had been}} {{proposed}} since the 1960s, {{as part of}} the London Ringways, and was an important link between central London and the Docklands to East Anglia. However, road protests elsewhere had become increasingly visible, and urban road building <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of favour with the public. Local Member of Parliament Harry Cohen had been a vocal opponent of this scheme.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} four years, Lassie {{received}} very decent ratings. However, {{at the end}} of the 1958–1959 season, the ratings <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of the top 30 due to the constant turnover in the cast. Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, Lassies ratings greatly improved and by the spring of 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.|$|E
5|$|Historian Wilhelm Levison, {{writing in}} 1946, was sceptical about the {{authenticity}} of this charter. In particular, {{he felt that the}} two separate addresses were incongruous and suggested that the first address, occurring before the preamble, may have been inserted by someone familiar with Bede to echo Eadbald's future conversion (see below). A more recent and more positive appraisal by John Morris argues that the charter and its witness list are authentic because it incorporates titles and phraseology that <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of use by 800.|$|E

5|$|Holmes was keenly {{involved}} with {{the details of the}} Agricultural College, influencing everything from the purchase of land for the campus, layout of the buildings, and even the placement of the chairs and tables. Once the College opened, he assumed the role of treasurer and later Professor of Horticulture. By 1861, Holmes <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of favor with the other College administrators, and retired to his home in Detroit. Nevertheless, he continued to support and visit the college until his death in 1887.|$|E
5|$|In 1802, France sent {{most of the}} disgruntled legionnaires (two demi-brigades, 5,280 strong) to Haiti to {{put down}} the Haitian Revolution (on the Caribbean island of Haiti, known then as Saint Domingue, the French West Indies). Napoleon wanted to regain the colony of Saint Domingue, but {{preferred}} to save his main French army for more important matters, closer to home. The now inconvenient Polish units were accompanied by contingents of Germans and Swiss French allies, as well as by French units that <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of favour with Napoleon and the French high command.|$|E
5|$|In 1849, {{while serving}} on the Texas {{frontier}} after the war, {{he was promoted to}} first lieutenant and then to captain in the 9th Infantry Regiment in 1855. In 1853, Pickett challenged a fellow junior officer, future Union general Winfield Scott Hancock, to a duel; (they had met only briefly when Hancock was passing through Texas). Hancock declined the duel, a response not unlikely as dueling <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of favor at the time.|$|E

5|$|Later, in the Central Asian campaign, {{a second}} plot against {{his life was}} revealed, this one instigated by his own royal pages. His {{official}} historian, Callisthenes of Olynthus, was implicated in the plot, and in the Anabasis of Alexander, Arrian states that Callisthenes and the pages were then tortured on the rack as punishment, and likely died soon after. It remains unclear if Callisthenes was actually involved in the plot, for prior to his accusation he <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of favour by leading {{the opposition to the}} attempt to introduce proskynesis.|$|E
5|$|The large centre canvas has {{not been}} {{positively}} identified. However both Koch and Campbell believe that a damaged Crucifixion, now in the Musées royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels, was probably the centrepiece. Its size (181×153.5cm) is exactly double that of the four wing panels. Campbell believes that the altarpiece was painted on commission for export, most likely to Venice. The altarpiece was probably broken up as large religious works <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of fashion by the 17th century, and would have had more value as single panels.|$|E
5|$|Trafford has two medieval castles. Dunham Castle is {{an early}} medieval castle in Dunham Massey. It belonged to Hamon de Massey, and was {{probably}} still standing in the early 14th century. The bailey was landscaped into the grounds of Dunham Massey Hall and its moat turned into an ornamental pond. Watch Hill Castle {{is an early}} medieval motte-and-bailey castle {{on the border of}} Dunham Massey and Bowdon. It is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The motte and surrounding ditch still survives, although it <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of use by the 13th century.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1944, the M3 <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> {{of favor}} even with {{airborne}} troops, despite their strong preference for {{compact and lightweight}} weapon systems. The Airborne Command had rejected the 57mm M1 {{in the summer of}} 1943 claiming its unfitness for airlifting and the Table of Organisation and Equipment (TO) of February 1944 still had airborne divisions keeping their 37mm guns. Nevertheless, the 82nd and the 101st, were reequipped with British-manufactured 6-pounder gun (57mm) on carriage Mk III (designed to fit into the British Horsa glider) for the Normandy airdrops. This change was officially introduced in the TO of December 1944.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{exploding}} cigars were being turned out by manufacturers such as Adams and Appel, the chemical explosive variety <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of favor. According to Adams, the large-scale {{switch to a}} non-chemical device occurred in approximately 1915 {{in the aftermath of}} a death caused by a homemade exploding cigar rigged with dynamite. Though exploding cigars were not normally rigged with dynamite but with explosive caps using a less powerful incendiary, following the incident, a number of U.S. states banned the product altogether. The replacement for chemical explosives was a metal spring mechanism, bound with cord—as the victim puffed away, the cord burned through, causing the device to spring open, thus rupturing the cigar's end.|$|E
5|$|In 1221 Llywelyn {{took control}} of {{neighbouring}} Meirionnydd from his son, Gruffydd; Llywelyn had previously placed Gruffydd in power there, but {{the father and son}} <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out.</b> The prince then began to build the castle of Castell y Bere with the intent of controlling the local population and securing his new south-west border, which included the mountain trade routes between Gwynedd, Powys Wenwynwyn and Deheubarth. Castell y Bere was the first of several stone castles built by Llywelyn and the initial castle consisted of several towers positioned around a courtyard, situated on a rocky hillock in the Dysynni Valley near Cadair Idris.|$|E

5|$|In 1975 and 1976, several {{stockholder}} lawsuits {{were filed}} against American Financial, and Keating was {{under fire for}} aspects involving unsecured loans, stock warrants, and {{the sale of the}} Enquirer. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched a major investigation of the company and charged Lindner, Keating and others with having defrauded investors and filing false SEC reports. At particular issue was a $14 million loan that the SEC said was made on preferential terms. Keating resigned from American Financial in August 1976, with conflicting stories {{as to whether or not}} Keating and Lindner had remained close or whether they <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{founding}} of Moldavia {{began with the}} arrival of a Vlach (Romanian) voivode (military leader), Dragoș, soon followed by his people from Maramureș to the region of the Moldova River. Dragoș established a polity there as a vassal to the Kingdom of Hungary in the 1350s. The independence of the Principality of Moldavia was gained when Bogdan I, another Vlach voivode from Maramureş who <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> with the Hungarian king, crossed the Carpathians in 1359 and took control of Moldavia, wresting the region from Hungary. It remained a principality until 1859, when it united with Wallachia, initiating the development of the modern Romanian state.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} assigned labour quotas {{for each}} district to native commissioners across the territory {{who in turn}} called on local chiefs and headmen to provide workers. The tribal leaders decided who was required at the kraal and who would report to the district native commissioner for work. This system, known locally as the chibaro, cibbalo, isibalo or chipara—according to Charles van Onselen, synonymous etymologically with concepts ranging from contract labour to slavery—had been relatively widespread during Company rule (1890–1923), but <b>had</b> <b>fallen</b> <b>out</b> of use by the 1930s.
