25|$|Tinamous have a pneumaticized {{skeleton}} with a sternal keel, 16–18 cervical vertebrae, and fused thoracic vertebrae. They have poor circulation, {{evidenced by}} a greenish tint to the skin. They also have relatively the smallest hearts and lungs of all birds, comprising only 1.6–3.1% {{of their body}} weight, whereas the equivalent in a <b>domestic</b> <b>chicken</b> is 12%. Despite their poor flying ability, the percentage of their body mass that is muscle is 28.6–40%, {{which is similar to}} that of hummingbirds. The preen gland is small and tufted. The male has a corkscrew shaped penis, similar to those of the ratites and to the hemipenis of some reptiles. The female has a small phallic organ in the cloaca which becomes larger during the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|Once bonded, a {{male and}} female kiwi tend to live their entire lives as a monogamous couple. During the mating season, June to March, the pair call to each other at night, and meet in the nesting burrow every three days. These {{relationships}} may last for up to 20years. They are unusual among other birds in that, along with some raptors, they have a functioning pair of ovaries. (In most birds and in platypuses, the right ovary never matures, so that only the left is functional.) Kiwi eggs can weigh up to one-quarter {{the weight of the}} female. Usually, only one egg is laid per season. The kiwi lays the biggest egg in proportion to its size of any bird in the world, so even though the kiwi {{is about the size of}} a <b>domestic</b> <b>chicken,</b> it is able to lay eggs that are about six times the size of a chicken's egg. The eggs are smooth in texture, and are ivory or greenish white. The male incubates the egg, except for the great spotted kiwi, A. haastii, in which both parents are involved. The incubation period is 63–92days. Producing the huge egg places significant physiological stress on the female; for the thirty days it takes to grow the fully developed egg, the female must eat three times her normal amount of food. Two to three days before the egg is laid there is little space left inside the female for her stomach and she is forced to fast.|$|E

500|$|Chickens are medium-sized, chunky {{birds with}} an upright stance and characterised by fleshy red combs and wattles on their heads. Males, known as cocks, are usually larger, more boldly coloured, {{and have more}} exaggerated plumage than females (hens). Chickens are gregarious, omnivorous, ground-dwelling birds that in their natural {{surroundings}} search among the leaf litter for seeds, invertebrates, and other small animals. They seldom fly except {{as a result of}} perceived danger, preferring to run into the undergrowth if approached. Today's <b>domestic</b> <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is mainly descended from the wild red junglefowl of Asia, with some additional input from [...] grey junglefowl. Domestication is believed to have taken place between 7,000 and 10,000 years ago, and what are thought to be fossilized chicken bones have been found in northeastern China dated to around 5,400 BC. Archaeologists believe domestication was originally for the purpose of cockfighting, the male bird being a doughty fighter. By 4,000 years ago, chickens seem to have reached the Indus Valley and 250 years later, they arrived in Egypt. They were still used for fighting and were regarded as symbols of fertility. The Romans used them in divination, and the Egyptians made a breakthrough when they learned the difficult technique of artificial incubation. Since then, the keeping of chickens has spread around the world for the production of food with the domestic fowl being a valuable source of both eggs and meat.|$|E

60|$|There {{is another}} {{possible}} {{way in which}} Whitooweek may carry her young, though I have never seen it. An old hunter and keen observer of wild life, with whom I sometimes roam the woods, once stumbled upon a mother woodcock and her brood by a little brook {{at the foot of}} a wild hillside. One of the chicks was resting upon the mother's back, just as one often sees a <b>domestic</b> <b>chicken.</b> At my friend's sudden approach the mother rose, taking the chick with her on her back, and vanished among the thick leaves. The rest of the brood, three of them, disappeared instantly; and the man, after finding one of them, went on his way without waiting to see whether the mother returned for the rest. I give the incident for what it is worth as a possible suggestion as to the way in which young woodcock are carried to and fro; but I am quite sure that those that have come under my own observation were carried by an entirely different method.|$|E

40|$|Newcastle {{disease is}} one of the {{important}} diseases of poultry. It usually causes a great loss in poultry industry and <b>domestic</b> village <b>chickens.</b> Since <b>domestic</b> <b>chickens</b> in villages are free ranging for food, the chance of contact with wild birds which may act as reservoirs is high. This can make <b>domestic</b> <b>chickens</b> as a reservoir. For determining the role of <b>domestic</b> <b>chickens</b> in the epizootiology of Newcastle disease in village conditions in Isfahan province 400 serum samples from chickens with no history of vaccination from four regions (Khomeinishahr, Zarinshahr, Falavarjan and Mobarekeh) were collected in summer of 1998 and summer of 1999. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was used for titration of antibodies against Newcastle disease virus. Chi-square and binomial tests were used for statistical analyses. Sixty nine and half and 68. 5 per cent of the sera were positive in the two consecutive seasons. The difference was not significant (P< 0. 05). About 25 % of young chickens (3 - 4 months) and adult chickens (1 - 2 years old) were negative for HI antibodies and so sensitive to the disease in each season. Significant correlation was observed between the HI antibody titers and the age of the chickens (P< 0. 01). A specific pattern of seroconversion was observed which was independent to the prevalence of the disease in industrial poultry flocks in each region and all regions studied. It was concluded that about thirty five per cent of the <b>domestic</b> village <b>chickens</b> are protected against virulent strains of Newcastle disease in summer and {{for the protection of the}} rest routine vaccination especially in spring and summer was suggested...|$|R

The meat-type chicken had more food daily (about 1. 7 folds) and greater body weights (about 1. 5 folds) and brain weights than the layer-type chicken at the age of 14 d. In the meat-type of chicken, NPY mRNA levels of the IN and PVN were significantly greater than those of the LHA, and were not significantly different between the IN and PVN. However, in the layer-type of chicken, NPY mRNA levels were significantly greater in the IN than those in the LHA and PVN, and were not significantly different between the PVN and LHA. In all these hypothalamic regions, the layer-type of chicken had significantly higher NPY mRNA levels than the meat-type chicken did.
