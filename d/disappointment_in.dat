This study explored such <b>disappointments</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of}} betrayal, rejection and the accompanying beliefs, emotions and behaviours using the Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy theoretical framework. A theory-building positivistic case study design was implemented. Five participants completed a quantitative measure of REBT beliefs, the Shortened General Attitudes and Beliefs Scale, and participated in a semi-structured interview. The experience of a romantic betrayal or rejection elicited greater irrational than rational beliefs, and more dysfunctional than functional outcomes (emotions and behaviours) for each participant. The implications for clinical practice are discussed using the REBT theoretical framework...|$|R
5|$|Andrea Bowen, {{who starred}} as Susan's daughter, Julie, {{departed}} from the cast, as her character left for college {{at the end of}} the fourth season.

Joy Lauren, who portrayed Bree's daughter, Danielle, and Lyndsy Fonseca, who played Katherine's daughter, Dylan, also left the main cast, although the former appeared in the season premiere as a guest star. Because the fourth season ended leaving Mike's whereabouts unknown, James Denton's return to the series was questioned during hiatus. Denton stated in May2008 that producers would not make a decision on his character until mid-June and that he was preparing to find work in case his contract was terminated.

5|$|After graduating, Horvath {{attended}} Ohio State University on a work scholarship, {{but managed}} to make the school's football team in 1940. Horvath was small for a football player – he weighed just 160 pounds – but was a quick runner and had a strong arm. Ohio State's football team was a <b>disappointment</b> <b>in</b> 1940, however, finishing {{the season with a}} 4–4 win–loss record under head coach Francis Schmidt. Schmidt was fired after the season and replaced by Paul Brown, an Ohio high school coach who had guided Massillon Washington to a series of undefeated records and state championships. Brown simplified Ohio State's offense, but imposed a level of discipline and organization that had been absent under Schmidt. Horvath was a reserve halfback in the Buckeyes' single-wing offense in 1941, when the team posted a 6–1–1 win–loss–tie record and finished second in the Big Ten Conference standings. He played in many games, but senior fullback Jack Graf and senior halfback Tom Kinkade got most of the carries for Ohio State.|$|E

Nao, on the other hand, reported the failure of his mission to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters; his superiors did not express <b>disappointment</b> <b>in</b> {{the failure of the}} operation, but instead they encouraged Nao and his men to destroy Card at all costs. Finally on May 1, 1964, Viet Cong reconnaissance teams spotted USNS Card as the ship sailed through Ganh Rai Bay and entered Long Tau River, so they immediately reported the information to the 65th Special Operations Group in Saigon. As usual, Card docked at the commercial port district in the city to unload another shipment of cargo and military helicopters, as well as upload a batch of helicopters scheduled to be returned to the United States.|$|E
