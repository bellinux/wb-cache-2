2500|$|The PFA-100 (Platelet Function Assay-100) is {{a system}} for {{analysing}} platelet function in which citrated whole blood is aspirated through [...] a <b>disposable</b> <b>cartridge</b> containing an aperture within a membrane coated with either collagen and epinephrine or collagen and ADP. These agonists induce platelet adhesion, activation and aggregation leading to rapid occlusion of the aperture and cessation of blood flow termed the closure time (CT). An elevated CT with EPI and collagen can indicate intrinsic defects such as von Willebrand disease, uremia, or circulating platelet inhibitors. The follow up test involving collagen and ADP is used to indicate if the abnormal CT with collagen and EPI {{was caused by the}} effects of acetyl sulfosalicylic acid (aspirin) or medications containing inhibitors.|$|E
2500|$|Aqueous {{film-forming}} foam (AFFF), used on A and B {{fires and}} for vapor suppression. The {{most common type}} in portable foam extinguishers. [...] AFFF {{was developed in the}} 1960s under Project Light Water in a joint venture between 3M and the U.S. Navy. AFFF forms a film that floats out before the foam blanket, sealing the surface and smothering the fire by excluding oxygen. AFFF is widely used for ARFF firefighting at airports, often as a twin agent unit (TAU) with purple-K dry chemical.It contains fluoro-tensides [...] which can be accumulated in the human body. The long-term effects of this on the human body and environment are unclear at this time. AFFF can be discharged through an air-aspirating branchpipe nozzle or a spray nozzle, and is now produced only in pre-mix form, where the foam concentrate is stored mixed with water. In the past, as solid charge model was produced, where the AFFF concentrate was housed as a dry compound in an external, <b>disposable</b> <b>cartridge</b> in a specially designed nozzle. The extinguisher body was charged with plain water, and the discharge pressure mixed the foam concentrate with the water upon squeezing the lever. These extinguishers received double the rating of a pre-mix model (40-B instead of 20-B), but are now considered obsolete, as parts and refill cartridges have been discontinued by the manufacturer.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} adopted for marking paper. In the telegraphic siphon recorder of 1858 a fine capillary tube is connected to an ink reservoir and is deflected by the process signal. In modern strip chart recorders, a <b>disposable</b> <b>cartridge</b> combining both a fiber-tipped pen and ink reservoir has been used. Other types of recorder use a heated stylus and thermally sensitive paper, an impact printer using a ribbon and an electrically operated hammer, an electric signal acting through a stylus onto electro-sensitive paper, or an electric spark that makes a visible spot on aluminized paper. One form of sensitive and high-speed recorder used beams of ultraviolet light reflected off mirror galvanometers, directed at light-sensitive paper.|$|E
5000|$|The {{engine was}} a modern unit, with a {{water-cooled}} inline design with forged crankshaft, alloy cross-flow head and five main bearings. An unusual feature on early models was {{the absence of}} a spin-on paper oil filter. Instead, the engine featured a form of centrifugal oil filter in the hollow rear crankshaft pulley, although all later versions used the more traditional <b>disposable</b> <b>cartridge</b> filters. One of its major innovations was the use of a swirl vortex on the intake valve port which gave very good combustion, and thus both power and economy for this time. This engine proved cheap to build, and several models of different sizes and market segments used this displacement, which survived until 1982, as the ever-present entry level for the Simca 1100.|$|E
50|$|As {{compared}} to the <b>disposable</b> and <b>cartridge</b> razors, straight razors are more economical, despite a higher initial cost {{due to the fact}} that if properly cared for, no additional cost is incurred, as {{compared to}} disposable razors where new cartridges must be periodically procured.|$|R

5000|$|A {{fountain}} pen uses water-based liquid ink delivered through a nib. The ink flows from a reservoir through a [...] "feed" [...] to the nib, then through the nib, due to capillary action and gravity.

A {{fountain pen}} reservoir can be refillable or disposable; the disposable type is called an ink cartridge. A pen with a refillable reservoir may have a mechanism, such as a piston, to draw ink from a bottle through the nib, or it may require refilling with an eyedropper. Refill reservoirs, also known as cartridge converters, are available for some pens which use <b>disposable</b> <b>cartridges.</b> A fountain pen {{can be used with}} permanent or non-permanent inks.|$|R
50|$|The {{greater part}} of Manton's career was to be spent at loggerheads with the British Army. Manton managed to {{interest}} the army in purchasing a larger version of his wooden cup design {{to be used in}} rifled artillery. Manton worked tirelessly to improve the very inaccurate cannon, and did so by creating a new type of ammunition. Firstly, the ammunition was to be loaded in a rifled cannon. Secondly, the cannonball was attached to the wooden cup that fit into the rifled grooves of the cannon, which was in turn connected to a sack of gunpowder, thus eliminating the need for powder and shot to be loaded separately. The idea of having the powder fixed behind the shot in a <b>disposable</b> <b>cartridge</b> is one still extant today; it is the basis for modern bullet design. It also helped pave the way for breech-loading weaponry.|$|E
5000|$|The plaintiff, a {{manufacturer}} of photocopiers and laser printers, incorporated the parts which might need replacing during the lifetime of a machine and a supply of toner in a <b>disposable</b> <b>cartridge,</b> which could be inserted in the machine by its owner when the toner had to be renewed.
