40|$|The {{concept of}} the More Electric Aircraft, where the {{majority}} of the aircraft’s secondary needs will be supplied by electrical power, is under continuous research {{over a number of years}} in order to conform the recent demand for more efficient and environmentally friendly aircrafts. Advancements in power electronics have contributed towards the realization of that demand, by introducing lightweight, high-power density and highly efficient in harsh environment power electronics. The increase in power density of power electronic systems was made feasible, so far, by developments in the semiconductors field, namely by semiconductors that can operate at higher switching frequencies and generate less power loss. Wide-bandgap devices, such as Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistors, have emerged as possible candidates to replace silicon and even silicon carbide devices in various power conversion applications offering potential benefits for high frequency power conversion due to their intrinsic material properties. Another step towards higher power densities is to utilize appropriate circuit topologies since they can reduce the stress upon the components and the cooling requirements. However, as the frequency goes up, the switching behavior of the device is not only influenced by the die itself and the device package’s and circuit’s parasitic elements can not be neglected any more. One of these parasitic elements is the the equivalent parasitic capacitance (EPC) of the magnetic component, which is part of almost every topology. This thesis project aims at two things: first, to observe the switching behavior of a high-voltage cascode GaN High Electron Mobility Transistor (HEMT) under <b>inductive</b> <b>clamped</b> load condition, which is the same commutation mode for the power devices as switching in a PWM, hard-switching type converter and second, to investigate the influence of the magnetic component’s EPC on the switching behavior of the GaN HEMT. For this, an analytical loss model of the device was developed and a double-pulse tester (DPT), which is considered to be a very good example of that load condition, was optimally designed and manufactured in order to verify the analytical model. Two pulses are launched to the device under test (DUT) and the switching transitions of the DUT can be captured for any desired current and voltage rating under hard-switching conditions. Moreover, when operating under that load conditions, applying active devices with reverse recovery charge has significant influence on the switching behavior of the DUT, so both cases will be examined. Finally, in order to characterize the device and eventually verify the analytical loss model, current and voltage measurements need to be taken during the turn-on and turn-off switching transitions. As the GaN HEMT is capable of switching are very high speed, there are issues and limitations that need to be taken into consideration in order to ensure the fidelity and the accuracy of these high frequency measurementsElectrical Power EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R

40|$|Synchronous buck {{converter}} based multiphase architectures are evaluated {{to determine whether}} or not the most widespread voltage regulator topology can meet the power delivery requirements of next generation computer microprocessors. According to the prognostications, the load current will rise to 200 A along with the decrease of the supply voltage to 0. 5 V and staggering tight dynamic and static load line tolerances. In view of these demands, researchers face serious challenges to bring forth compliant solutions that can further offer acceptable conversion efficiencies and minimum mainboard area occupancy. Among the most prominent investigation fronts are those surveying fundamental technology improvements aiming at making power semiconductor devices more effective at high switching frequency. The latter is of critical importance as the increase of the switching frequency is fundamentally recognized as the way forward to enhance power density conversion. Provided that switching losses must be kept low to enable the miniaturization of the filter components, one primary goal is to cope with semiconductor and system integration technologies enabling fast dynamic operation of ultra-low ON resistance power switches. This justifies the main focus of this thesis work, centered around a comprehensive analysis of the MOSFET switching behavior in the synchronous {{buck converter}}. The MOSFETs dynamic operation, far from being well describable with the traditional <b>clamped</b> <b>inductive</b> hard-switching mode, is strongly influenced by a number of frequently ignored linear and nonlinear parasitic elements that must be taken into account in order to fully predict real switching waveforms, understand their dynamics, and most importantly, identify and quantify the related mechanisms leading to heat generation. This will be revealed from in-depth investigations of the switched converter under fast switching speeds and heavy load. Recognizing the key relevance of appropriate modeling tools that support this task, the second focal point of the thesis aims at developing a number of suitable models for the switching analysis of power MOSFETs. Combined with a series of design guidelines and optimization procedures, these models form the basis of a proposed methodological approach, where numerical computations replace the usually enormous experimental effort to elucidate the most effective pathways towards reducing power losses. This gives rise to the concept referred to as virtual design loop, which is successfully applied to the development of a new power MOSFET technology offering outstanding dynamic and static performance characteristics. From a system perspective, the limits of the power density conversion will be explored for this and other emerging technologies that promise to open up a new paradigm in power integration capabilities.
