2500|$|The second section, [...] "The Love", {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "a thunderous yearning through gigantic mid tempo, electronic balladry". It opens with the [...] "volcanic" [...] ballad [...] "Moments", which boasts atmospherics and influences of [...] "trippy" [...] samba. Lyrically, it sees Lo confessing her flaws before declaring [...] "On good days, I am charming as fuck!". [...] "The Way That I Am" [...] is a dubstep song filled with [...] "pain and passion" [...] as Lo sings in a soulful rasp and lyrically cries out to her partner to love her as she is; including flaws. [...] "Got Love" [...] is one of the albums [...] "pure" [...] pop moments, and contains an unwaveringly positive attitude. Lyrically, she rejoices exultant feelings of first falling in love as she sings [...] "Good enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond/Good enough to turn the valleys into mountain tops", and discusses the theme of immortality [...] "We live like legends now, know that would never die/Oh, we Got Love". Closing out the section is the power pop song [...] "Not on Drugs". Primarily a guitar-driven song that explores the topic of a feeling of love so bewildering and overpowering that it affects your behavior, as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>on</b> drugs.|$|E
