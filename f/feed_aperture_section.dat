40|$|The {{performance}} of multibeam focal plane arrays <b>feeding</b> a single <b>aperture</b> is usually reduced due to conflicting requirements on the feed elements. Dense packing is usually required {{to minimize the}} beam separation, while typically large <b>feed</b> <b>apertures</b> are needed to provide the high feed directivity to reduce spillover losses from the reflector. In this paper the use of dielectric super-layers to shape the radiation pattern of each feed is demonstrated. The shaping is obtained by exciting, according to design, a pair of TE/TM leaky waves. The spillover from the reflector is reduced without physically increasing the dimensions of each single element aperture. A prototype of a feed array composed of 19 waveguides arranged in a hexagonal lattice was designed, manufactured and tested. The measured embedded patterns provided an increase of the edge of coverage gain, {{with respect to the}} free space case, of at least 0. 6 dB in an operating bandwidth (BW) of ≈ 12 %. Moreover when reactive loading of adjacent feeds is adopted the increase in the edge of coverage with respect to the free space case was demonstrated to be larger than 1. 6 dB over a 3 % BW. © 2008 IEEE...|$|R

With more high frequency satellite bands coming in the market, {{there is a need}} to develop such systems with multi-band or wideband operation with reconfigurable antennas which can provide simultaneous transmit receive capabilities on different polarizations as well as have properties suitable to track the satellite. This thesis is primarily focused on developing a satellite communication system which operates simultaneously over X (7. 25 - 8. 4 GHz) and Ka (20. 2 - 31 GHz) band using the new wide band technology referred to as Eleven feed with broad band choke horn. This type of system finds commercial applications in satellite earth terminals for voice, video or data communication for news broadcast or military warfare applications. The first section of this thesis describes basic blocks of such a satellite communication system and emphasizes on the feed with prime focus reflector which is very common type of antenna for these applications. Furthermore, it gives details of the ‘Eleven’ feed geometry formed by two parallel (linear as well as circular) dipoles above ground plane and describes how dipole separation and height above ground plane influence radiation performance characterized by <b>feed</b> <b>aperture</b> efficiency. In order to achieve dual band performance, different technologies like Eleven feed, Hat feed, Choke Horn, stacked patch arrays are briefly discussed in section two and combination of Eleven Feed with Choke Horn giving better than - 2 dB aperture efficiencies in both bands is considered as potential technology to explore further. Finally, the simulated performance of X band ‘Eleven’ feed integrated with Ka band choke horn is presented in section three.

40|$|Abstract- In {{the design}} of Reflector antenna systems, the control of sidelobes caused from {{spillover}} of the primary pattern presents a major design challenge. The design of the illumination pattern of the reflector system is key to designing a reflector system that optimizes gain while minimizing {{the level of the}} sidelobes. The reduction of spillover sidelobes requires the use of large <b>aperture</b> <b>feeds</b> that provide a highly tapered illumination pattern. One of the traditional methods for accomplishing this design is the use of large aperture conical or corrugated horns for the feed. These designs are extremely effective for single band feeds but present problems when needed to operate over an extended frequency band. The approach presented in this paper attempts to illustrate a broadband solution to the feed pattern shaping design. The use of a doubly shaped lens placed at the aperture of a multi-band feed is investigated. The investigation is performed on a parabolic antenna system. The first surface of the lens transforms the radiation pattern into a plain wave exiting the <b>feed</b> <b>aperture.</b> The second surface then refocuses the radiation to {{the focal point of the}} reflector’s parabolic surface. This approach allows greater control of the primary pattern and allows the illumination pattern to be optimized for the antenna system design...|$|R

40|$|Aperture and {{reflector}} antennas play a {{key role}} in the communication industry, and methods of enhancing the speed of their analysis and measurement can benefit industry as well as promote better understanding of software modeling through faster visualization. This dissertation addresses such methods. Use of the three-parameter aperture distribution, unified for both sum and difference patterns, provides fast calculation of the aperture radiation characteristics through the use of closed form equations. All reflector antenna systems require a feed to illuminate the reflector, and the <b>feed</b> <b>aperture</b> field integration and spherical wave expansion methods serve as means to trade accuracy for compute speed. The mode matching method of cylindrical corrugated feedhorn analysis is shown to be accelerated by nearly two orders of magnitude with the use of optimized computer math libraries. The Gaussian beam method is shown to improve computational speed by up to two orders of magnitude compared to brute force physical optics integration, and the Levin method up to three orders of magnitude acceleration. The use of graphics processors accelerates the physical optics compute speed by two orders of magnitude or more.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{holographic}} antennas are investigated as an alternate technology to reflectors and microstrip phased arrays {{for use in}} Ka-band applications. These antennas combine the advantages of low profile printed technology with an unconstrained feed to avoid excessive losses associated with conventional phased array feeds. The main purpose of this work is to apply optical holography theory at microwave frequencies {{in the design of}} Ka-band holographic antennas. As with optical frequencies, the interference pattern between two waves is calculated in order to generate the hologram. The simplest pattern is a zone plate representing the destructive pattern which can be easily reproduced using microstrip technology. To fabricate the antennas, conductor strips are etched on a dielectric material where the two interfering waves are 180 ° out of phase. The hologram is then illuminated by the reference wave to reconstruct the desired antenna pattern. An interesting feature of these antennas is that they can be designed so that the feed is in the same plane as the holographic plate, making the structures almost flat and preventing <b>feed</b> <b>aperture</b> blockage. Measurements of various prototypes validated the holographic concept and have shown that the efficiency of the proposed holographic antennas is comparable to that of Ka-band passive phased arrays with conventional microstrip feeds. Also, based on the experimental results, some design guidelines are established along with a methodology for enhancing the efficiency. The efficiency-improvement methods include multi-layer structures, feed horns, dipole-holograms, diamond-shaped holograms, and many others...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{involves the}} analysis and design of a new band of horn antennas, namely Frequency Selective Horns (FSHs). Folding a Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) into a shape of a cone makes a FSH. The stimulus behind this research emanates from an idea to use the FSH as a microwave camera for medical diagnostic purposes. FSHs with dipole geometries have been modelled using existing software. A quasi-static approximation models the dipole elements with a dielectric backing as dielectrically loaded cylindrical conducting elements. The curvature of the surface is taken into account by dividing the elements into segments that conform to the curved surface. An integral equation {{takes into account the}} interactions between all the elements. The current due to the incident electromagnetic incidence is solved using the Method of Moment (MoM) technique. The author modified the model in order to speed up the computational time by utilising the symmetries in the impedance matrix. The predicted results of the conical FSH with dipole elements have been compared with experimental results carried out in an anechoic chamber. The comparisons include E and H-plane radiation patterns and the frequency response. Furthermore, current distributions {{on the surface of the}} cone have been predicted and return-loss measurements have been produced. Five FSHs with different geometries are presented in this thesis. The near field of the horn is modelled by sub-dividing the <b>feed</b> <b>aperture</b> into small patches and summing the fields generated by each patch in order to find the total field from the circular waveguide.

This article begins with three working examples ofexisting dual-band-antenna approaches, and discusses the dual-band feed that was developed for the antenna to be used on the scorrADM, a satellite communications terminal for mobile command posts. Excellent performance for the feed and antenna in both bands has been achieved. Other applications ofthe feed with appropriate modifications for dielectric-lens antennas, ADE (displaced-axis elliptical) antennas, and compact eleetronic-Iobing antennas are also d 4 cussed. These variations offeeds have been used in the FEP spot-beam antenna backup and a military-communications-satellite spot-beam antenna, in satellite-communications terminals on submarines, and in portable terminals (e. g., SCAMP and Advanced SCAMP). I N THE MODERN WORLD, we have all encountered many communications and radar terminals (1, 2] and have therefore glimpsed profiles of big and small antenna dishes. But we rarely have the chance to see any details ofthe feeds ofthe antennas. In theory, we can design an antenna feed simply by applying the wellknown Maxwell equations with the appropriate boundary conditions. In practice, however, only the simplest antenna reeds operating in a single frequency band can be analyzed this way.
