40|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} {{hyponatremia}} in rats by intravenous saline: Comparison of rate versus magnitude of correction. The {{role of the}} rate of correction {{in the development of}} demyelinating brain lesions after correction of chronic severe hyponatremia is controversial. It has been recently suggested in rats treated by intravenous (i. v.) hypertonic saline (NaCl) that both the rate and the absolute change in serum sodium represent critical risk factors. However, we previously demonstrated in rats treated by intraperitoneal (i. p.) injections of NaCl that below a threshold of serum sodium rise of 20 mEq/liter/ 24 hr, only 5 % of the brain lesions were recorded, even in rats submitted to a rapid (1 hr) serum sodium increment following the i. p. <b>injection.</b> <b>Working</b> below this threshold (serum sodium rise < 20 mEq/liter/ 24 hr) in the present work, allowed us to independently determine the role of the rate in the outcome of the correction. This was done by submitting the rats to a rapid (1 hr) intravenous infusion of NaCl. As a difference between the i. p. and i. v. route in the degree of volume expansion produced by the NaCl administration could also {{play a role in the}} pathogenesis of the brain lesions, rats treated with rapid i. v. infusion of NaCl (associated with volume expansion) were compared to a group of rats treated with water restriction (associated to volume contraction) to evaluate the role of volemia on the incidence of neurological damage. Hyponatremia was induced over three days with d-glucose in water and vasopressin. The group 1 was corrected by intravenous (i. v.) infusion of hypertonic saline over one hour. Rats achieved a serum sodium correction of 12 ± 0. 5 mEq/liter (8 to 17 mEq/liter) at the end of the infusion and of 13. 5 ± 0. 6 mEq/liter (8 to 19 mEq/liter) after the first 24 hours. Group 2 was submitted to spontaneous correction with water restriction over 48 hours. The maximum daily increment in serum sodium observed during this period in this group was 14. 8 ± 0. 5 mEq/liter (9 to 19 mEq/liter). No difference could be observed in the incidence of brain lesions between both groups. Only one rat (1 of 25) was damaged in group 1 and two rats (2 of 24) in group 2, an incidence similar to our previous results. We conclude that: (1) A rapid (1 hr) and large (12 mEq/liter, range 8 to 17 mEq/liter in 1 hr) rise in serum sodium after NaCl administration is well tolerated provided that the limit of daily absolute change in serum sodium (20 mEq/liter/ 24 hr) is not exceeded. In these conditions, the rate of the correction is not important; (2) In the same conditions, a correction associated with an acute (1 hr) volume expansion (NaCl i. v.) is not more toxic for the brain than water restriction (volume contraction) alone...|$|E

The amplitude of this latter component varies with electrolyte composition from 25 to 9 %.

40|$|AbstractAs sensing {{techniques}} {{continue to}} enhance the manufacturing industry in terms of condition monitoring, process control and decision making, understanding uncertainty involved in sensing has remained a challenging problem. Sensor readings may be affected by deterioration of the hardware and environmental perturbations. Prior studies {{reported in the literature}} assumed multiple co-located homogeneous sensors to provide redundant information for uncertainty evaluation. Such an approach is often times not applicable given space restraint and cost-effectiveness concerns. Furthermore, it is difficult to distinguish the sources that have caused the variation of sensor readings, e. g., limitation in the sensor precision or variation in the measured quantity. To address these challenges, a method for computing uncertainty of non-homogeneous sensors is developed, using on-line injection molding quality monitoring as experimental verification. The method includes two computational steps. First, measurements provided by four spatially distributed sensors (two temperature and two pressure sensors) in an injection mould cavity are fused to estimate the part quality (thickness). Second, the ground truth is approximated from the estimated part quality, through inverse process. Subsequently, the approximated ground truth is utilized to calculate the uncertainty of each sensor used in the measurement process. To quantify sensor uncertainty, a metric including accuracy, precision and trust is defined. The detection of abnormal sensors in turn provides input to improved part quality estimation. The developed technique is evaluated experimentally by measurements on a production-grade <b>injection</b> molding machine <b>working</b> under a variety of machining settings.

40|$|AbstractThe antiatherogenic {{properties}} of repeated injections of egg phosphatidylcholine large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of 100 nm diameter {{were tested in}} an experimental model for atherosclerosis. Forty eight rabbits {{were divided into two}} diet groups fed standard rabbit chow or fed a cholesterol-enriched diet (0. 5 % by weight) to induce the formation of atherosclerotic lesions. Prior to the initiation of LUV therapy, the cholesterol diet was ceased and all animals were returned to standard rabbit chow. The treatment protocol consisted of a total of 10 bolus injections of vesicles, at a phospholipid dose of 300 mg/kg body weight or the equivalent volume of saline, with one injection given to each animal every 10 days. LUV injections brought about a large movement of cholesterol into the blood pool and resulted in a significant reduction in the cholesterol content as well as the degree of surface plaque involvement of aortic tissue in atherosclerotic animals. Most notably, the thoracic aorta of LUV-treated animals exhibited a 48 % reduction in tissue cholesterol content per gram of protein compared to saline-treated controls. Histochemical analyses revealed that aortas from animals receiving the repeated injections of LUVs displayed less cholesterol deposits in lesions, and a moderate reduction in intimal-to-medial thickness. This regression of atheroma, induced by LUV therapy, was observed even though animals possessed persistent elevated plasma cholesterol levels after the cholesterol-enriched diet was ceased. These results suggest that repeated <b>injections</b> of LUVs, <b>working</b> with endogenous HDL, may be a useful therapy in the management of atherosclerosis...|$|R

The need arose for more quantitative knowledge about NH 3 volatilization and for practical tools to reduce the NH 3 volatilization from manure. A database of field measurements was analysed to identify factors that effect the volatilization of NH 3 from manure applied by various techniques on grassland and arable land. The analyses showed that NH 3 volatilization is substantially reduced by application techniques like narrow band application and shallow injection, and by effective manure incorporation techniques. Also the manure composition, the application rate and the weather conditions substantially influenced the NH 3 volatilization rate. Draught force required for different application techniques on grassland varied considerably. The design of the shallow <b>injection</b> element, the <b>working</b> depth and soil circumstances had a substantial influence on the required draught force.

40|$|Modern {{manufacturing}} methods enable screw compressors to be constructed to such close tolerances that full 3 -D numerical {{calculation of the}} heat and fluid flow through them is required to obtain the maximum possible improvements in their design. An independent stand-alone CAD-CFD interface program has therefore been developed by the authors in order to generate a numerical grid for this purpose. Modifications implemented to the CFD procedure improved solutions in complex domains with strong pressure gradients. The interface employs a procedure to produce rotor profiles and an analytical transfinite interpolation method to obtain a fully structured 3 -D numerical mesh, which is directly transferable to a CFD code. Some features, which include an adaptive meshing procedure, mesh orthogonalization and smoothing, are employed to generate a numerical mesh which {{can take advantage of}} the techniques used in recent finite volume numerical method solvers.

An interface has therefore been developed in order to generate a 3 -D numerical grid for this purpose. This employs a procedure to produce rotor profiles and an analytical transfinite interpolation method with adaptive meshing to obtain a fully structured 3 -D numerical mesh, which is directly transferable to a Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. Robust calculations can then be performed while allowing for moving, stretching and sliding between the rotors with large variations in the chamber shape and proportions. Changes in the solver functions have improved convergence and increased the speed of solution. One of these is to include a means to maintain constant pressure within the inlet and outlet ports throughout the calculating procedure. Also, the CFD procedure has been modified to enable fast calculations to be made with real working fluids and to estimate two-phase flow effects due to phase change and oil <b>injection</b> in the <b>working</b> chamber. The interface, pre-processing code and calculating procedures have been used with a commercial CFD solver to estimate the performance of three different compressor applications. The predicted results for one of these were compared with those obtained from the author's measurement in an experimental test rig and good agreement was obtained...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a hybrid two-stage energy-recovery approach to sequester CO{sub 2 } and produce geothermal energy at low environmental risk and low cost by integrating geothermal production with CO{sub 2 } capture and sequestration (CCS) in saline, sedimentary formations. Our approach combines {{the benefits of}} the approach proposed by Buscheck et al. (2011 b), which uses brine as the working fluid, with those of the approach first suggested by Brown (2000) and analyzed by Pruess (2006), using CO{sub 2 } as the working fluid, and then extended to saline-formation CCS by Randolph and Saar (2011 a). During stage one of our hybrid approach, formation brine, which is extracted to provide pressure relief for CO{sub 2 } <b>injection,</b> is the <b>working</b> fluid for energy recovery. Produced brine is applied to a consumptive beneficial use: feedstock for fresh water production through desalination, saline cooling water, or make-up water to be injected into a neighboring reservoir operation, such as in Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS), where there is often a shortage of a working fluid. For stage one, it is important to find economically feasible disposition options to reduce the volume of brine requiring reinjection in the integrated geothermal-CCS reservoir (Buscheck et al. 2012 a). During stage two, which begins as CO{sub 2 } reaches the production wells; coproduced brine and CO{sub 2 } are the working fluids. We present preliminary reservoir engineering analyses of this approach, using a simple conceptual model of a homogeneous, permeable CO{sub 2 } storage formation/geothermal reservoir, bounded by relatively impermeable sealing units. We assess both the CO{sub 2 } sequestration capacity and geothermal energy production potential as a function of well spacing between CO{sub 2 } injectors and brine/CO{sub 2 } producers for various well patterns and for a range of subsurface conditions...|$|R
40|$|Transmission of {{bloodborne}} pathogens {{by means}} of unsafe injection practices is a significant public health problem in developing countries. Although the overall proportion for immunization is low among injections, unsafe immunization practices affect mostly infants, a population with an increased likelihood of becoming hepatitis B virus carriers. This study estimated the prevalence of unsafe <b>injection</b> among vaccinators <b>working</b> at the peripheral level in northwestern China {{and the risk of}} HBV infections among infant vaccinees, and analyzed factors contributing to the most prevalent unsafe practice: the reuse of a non-sterilized reusable syringe among infants. A knowledge-attitude-practice survey was conducted in which 180 peripheral vaccinators selected by multi-stage cluster sampling in each of four provinces and one autonomous region completed a self-administered questionnaire. The lack of observational data for assessing the validity of the self-reported practices made the study prone to systematic respondent bias that may have skewed the results towards underestimation of unsafe practices. The minimum estimate of the percentage of peripheral vaccinators reusing a syringe and/or needle without sterilization between infants was 7. 2 - 55. 0 %, whereas the percentage of those disposing of used disposable syringes and needles inappropriately was 8. 9 - 23. 3 % by province. According to a model-based estimate, the annual number of HBV infections among 100, 000 fully immunized children due to unsafe immunization injection was at least 135 - 3120. An insufficient supply of syringes and the attitude to justify reuse were significantly associated with the unsafe reuse of a reusable syringe in most part of the area studied. Introduction of auto-disable syringes may contribute to curb the unsafe practices, but the development of safe collection and disposal procedures for used syringes and needles is prerequisite. Sufficient supply of equipment as well as training, supervision, and monitoring targeting specifically on the risk behaviors and concerned attitudes are essential for behavior changes among the vaccinators.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Materials Science Program, Washington State UniversityTitanium dioxide {{functions}} as an electron transport medium in dye sensitized solar cells. Nanotubular anatase titanium dioxide {{is expected to}} be a better photoanode because of the direct path of the electrons from <b>injection</b> to the <b>working</b> electrode due to the ordered nanotube walls. However, the performance of titanium dioxide nanotube-based solar cells lags behind the nanoparticulate-based. In this work, the crystallographic and defect properties of titanium dioxide nanotubes are examined with spectroscopic and materials characterization techniques in order to understand its electrical properties. Defects in the crystal structure lead to trap states within the bandgap which either assist or hinder electron collection. Shallow traps, those within the range of kT from the conduction band help in increasing the density of states thus increasing conduction. Deep traps capture the electrons and increase the probability of recombination with the oxidized form of the electrolyte. To probe these intra-band states, intra-band photoluminescence spectroscopy was used. Nanotube photoluminescence consists of three types of emission at approximate peak positions of 425 nm (2. 9 eV), 550 nm (2. 2 eV), and 650 nm (1. 9 eV), which are attributed to recombination of the following nature: exciton, mobile electrons to trapped holes, and mobile holes to trapped electrons, respectively. These defects are similar to that found in nanoparticulate anatase. Although the nature of the defects is the same, the emission intensity in nanotubes is lower than nanoparticles. However, comparison with single nanotube photoluminescence revealed that quenching in "bulk" array is caused by significant charge transport in the lateral direction (between neighboring nanotubes). The orientation of the nanotube wall length is parallel (with slight angular deviations) to the c-axis direction of the unit cell as shown by electron backscatter diffraction. This leads to exposed planes of (100), (110), and (101). Single nanotube photoluminescence in epi-illumination showed that the walls are uniform with respect to defect densities. However, a focused laser beam gave satellite emissions from the ends of a nanotube that show recombination of mobile electrons with trapped holes giving a visual indication of electron transport in the nanostructure.
