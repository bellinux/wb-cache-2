40|$|We examine wage-bargaining in a two-sector economy when {{employers}} {{and labor unions}} in each sector are not always aware of all general equilibrium feedback effects. We show analytically that if agents only consider labor demand effects, low real wages and low unemployment result. With an intermediate view, i. e. when partial equilibrium effects within a sector are taken into account, high real wages and unemployment result. If all general equilibrium effects are considered at once, low real wages and low unemployment again result. The assumption that unions and <b>employers?</b> <b>federations</b> {{are not able to}} incorporate all feedback effects from other sectors may explain the persistence of high unemployment in Europe...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{regional}} labour {{markets in}} a country with centralised wage bargaining. We use a four-stage theoretical model with two regions and one sector. In the first stage the union and <b>employer</b> <b>federation</b> engage in Nash bargaining at the national level according to a Right To Manage (RTM) model. In the second stage the individual employers determine the number of employees they want to hire given the outcome of the national wage bargaining. In the third stage individuals decide whether or not they want to migrate to another region and if they want to participate in the labour market or not. In the fourth stage the product market clears. In this model, depending on the parameters, the change in participation and the level of migration determine the distribution of unemployment over the regions. ...|$|R
