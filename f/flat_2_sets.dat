The algorithm is designed to identify the <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>flat</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 regions based on certain criteria and filter these regions to minimize the noise prior and post Halftoning {{so as to make}} the hard copy look visibly pleasing. Noise prior to halftone process is removed using a spatial Gaussian filter together with a Hamming window, concluded from results after implementing various filtering techniques. A clustered dithering is applied in each channel of the image as Halftoning process. Furthermore, to minimize the post halftone noise, the halftone structure of the image is manipulated according to the neighboring sub-cells in their respective channels. This is done to reduce the brightness variation (a cause for noise) between the neighboring subcells. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm efficiently minimizes noise in <b>2</b> ̆ <b>2</b> <b>flat</b> <b>2</b> ̆ 2 regions of mirumal gradient change in color images...|$|R

The parametrization uses Hitchin's abelianization procedure to write such connections explicitly in terms of flat line bundles on a complex 1 -dimensional torus. This description is used to develop a spectral curve theory for the Lawson surface. This theory applies as well to other CMC and minimal surfaces with the same holomorphic symmetries as the Lawson surface but different Riemann surface structure. Additionally, we study the space of isospectral deformations of compact minimal surface of genus g≥ 2 and prove that it is generated by simple factor dressing.
