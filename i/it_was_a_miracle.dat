According to Godrich, [...] "I literally left him on a fucking table in my house and went and recorded. And it was a very, very emotional day for me. He was a string player as well so it was one of those things where it felt like he would want me to go and just do this." [...] Around the same period, Yorke announced his separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. He told Rolling Stone: [...] "There was a lot of difficult stuff going on at the time, and it was a tough time for us as people. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> that that record got made at all." ...|$|E

Club placed it among the 10 best {{chapters}} of the series and called it one of the scariest hours of television he had seen. In 2009, The Vancouver Sun named [...] "Home" [...] one of the best stand-alone episodes of the series and wrote that, because of its horrific theme of incest, the episode [...] "doesn't pull any punches". Den of Geek writer Nina Sordi placed the entry as the fourth best of the series in 2009, viewing its bleak humor and [...] "thought-provoking moments" [...] of dialogue as the factors that made it one of the most popular episodes. In 2008, Starpulse gave the installment an honorable mention as one of the 10 best X-Files episodes. In 2009, Connie Ogle from PopMatters rated the Peacock family among the greatest monsters of the series and stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> that the program [...] "slipped past" [...] the censors.|$|E

500|$|After the {{publication}} of Eureka, a vehement anonymous censure {{was published in the}} Literary Review. Poe believed it to have been written by John Henry Hopkins, Jr. (1820–1889), a young theological student, who had previously criticized the work as pantheistic and [...] "a damnable heresy" [...] that [...] "conscience would compel him to denounce". Literary critic George Edward Woodberry in 1885 thought the essay was based on a crude understanding of the science a student learns in school [...] "rendered ridiculous" [...] by absurdity and the density of his ignorance. Thomas Dunn English, a writer, lawyer, and doctor who frequently criticized Poe, wrote a news article for the John-Donkey with the headline, [...] "Great Literary Crash". The article explained that a shelf of books crashed because someone had [...] "imprudently" [...] stacked an edition of Eureka on it and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> that the whole building did not fall down because of it.|$|E
500|$|A {{letter to}} Hagenauer dated 16 August {{indicated}} that Leopold wished {{to proceed to}} Turin, then across northern Italy to Venice, and home via the Tyrol. [...] "Our own interest and love of travel should have induced us to follow our noses", he wrote, but added: [...] "...I have said I shall go [...] home and I shall keep my word". The family took a shorter route through Switzerland, arriving in Geneva on 20 August, where the children gave two concerts, and were received by the distinguished composer André-Ernest-Modeste Grétry. Many years later Grétry wrote of this encounter: [...] "I wrote for him [...] an Allegro in E flat, difficult but without pretension; he played it, and everyone, except myself, thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle.</b> The child had never broken off, but following the modulations, he had substituted a number of passages for those I had written".

2500|$|When the Rosary Way was {{successfully}} completed, Kossowski received [...] "the biggest ceramic commission that I ever had till then", The Vision of St. Simon Stock. Kossowski recalled:At that time I {{had already had}} some experience with the famous old Fulham Pottery which was still operating. They were quite ready to fire for me the larger pieces of ceramics in their old-fashioned kiln, one not used anymore elsewhere, heated by coal and coke. They could get only one temperature and one kind of glaze. You could not make any changes and I realized that every piece could be fired only once. So I had to put the colours and the glazes and the body in one firing only. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> that it came out quite alright, with very few small cracks.

2500|$|The Muqaddimah further {{notes that}} Moses lived {{only a few}} generations after Jacob, {{the founder of the}} Israelite tribes, {{according}} to the Levite tribe genealogy, as described by Al-Masudi. Ibn Khaldun argues that it [...] "is improbable that the descendants of one man could branch out into such a number within four generations." [...] The Muqaddimah also states that there was a general assumption that Solomon's army was similarly large, but Ibn Khaldun refutes this, noting that Solomon came only eleven generations after Jacob, and argues that the [...] "descendants of one man in eleven generations would not branch out into such a number, as has been assumed." [...] He then agrees with another statement from the [...] "Israelite Stories" [...] suggesting that Solomon's army had 12,000 soldiers and 1,400 horses. He notes that this was when the Israelite state was at its strongest, making other claims giving larger numbers for the Israelite army unlikely. Ibn Khaldun notes that Jews have claimed the unrealistically large increase in the Israelite population within several generations was possible because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> of God, a claim that Ibn Khaldun did not dismiss completely. He considers such a miracle highly unlikely, but appears to be open to the possibility.|$|E
