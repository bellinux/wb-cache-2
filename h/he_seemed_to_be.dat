5|$|For the old Diefenbaker {{was in full}} cry. All {{the agony}} of the {{disintegration}} of his government was gone, and <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a giant revived by his contact with the people. This was Diefenbaker's finest election. He was virtually alone on the hustings. Even such loyalists as Gordon Churchill had to stick close to their own bailiwicks, where they were fighting for their political lives.|$|E
5|$|On April 17, 2014, Ann Shulgin {{reported}} on Facebook {{that her husband}} had developed liver cancer, and in a May 31 update on Facebook she said that, although appearing frail, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> experiencing his last moments in peace and without pain. On June 2, 2014, Shulgin died at home in bed surrounded by family, fifteen days before his 89th birthday.|$|E
5|$|Celtic again {{qualified}} for the UEFA Champions League for the 2013–14 season, and again played against Barcelona at Parkhead on 1 October 2013, losing 1–0. Despite the defeat, Forster again impressed with several excellent saves, in particular an outstanding double save {{near the end of}} the match. Forster also pulled off a crucial save during a 2–1 win on 22 October 2013 over Ajax at Parkhead, saving from Thulani Serero when <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> clean through on goal.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} his four-year college eligibility, Bowen was {{eligible for the}} 1993 NBA draft, but went undrafted. Instead, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> destined to become a journeyman athlete. Between 1993 and 1997, Bowen played for five different teams, starting his professional career for the French teams of Le Havre in 1993–94 and Évreux the following season. In 1995–96 {{he played in the}} CBA with Rockford Lightning; he spent the next season back in France with Besançon, before returning to the Lightning in February 1997. Bowen made his NBA debut when he was signed to a ten-day contract by the Miami Heat the following month. His output consisted of 1 game, 1 minute and 1 block.|$|E
5|$|Having ascertained the {{identity}} of the ships Dance signalled for his merchants to form the line of battle, and continued their heading, while the French closed, but made no move to attack. Dance used the delay to gather his ships together so the stronger East Indiamen stood between the French and the weaker country ships. The merchants continued on towards the straits, followed by Linois, who was trying to gauge the strength of the convoy. There were more ships in the convoy than he had expected, and taken in by Dance's manoeuvres and the painted gunports, Linois suspected that several warships were escorting them. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> confirmed in his suspicions when at dawn on 15 February, both forces raised their colours. Dance ordered the brig Ganges and the four lead ships to hoist Blue Ensigns, {{while the rest of the}} convoy raised Red Ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this implied that the ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Peter Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection.|$|E

25|$|The Senate {{began to}} improve {{conditions}} for Blackwell {{towards the end of}} 1798. At their meeting on 24 November, the removal of the captives’ chains was ordered, and for Blackwell, a teacher of German was procured. Nevertheless, the deprivations of his confinement started to wear him down, and by the summer of 1799 <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{at the end of his}} tether.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Blake shared Dante's {{distrust}} of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly relished {{the opportunity to}} represent the atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's Inferno; {{he is said to}} have spent one of the very last shillings he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.|$|E
25|$|In 1847 President Riché died. During {{his tenure}} he had {{acted as a}} figurehead for the Boyerist ruling class, who {{immediately}} began {{to look for a}} replacement. Their attention quickly focused on Faustin Soulouque, whom the majority considered to be a somewhat dull and ignorant man. At the age of 65 <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a malleable candidate and was subsequently enticed to accept the role offered him, taking the Presidential Oath of Office on 2 March 1847.|$|E

25|$|Pernkopf {{was born}} in 1888 in the Lower Austria village of Rappottenstein, near the border with Bavaria. The {{youngest}} of three sons, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> considering a career in music upon his completion of the Gymnasium in Horn. However, {{the death of his}} father, the village's doctor, in 1903 led him to pursue medicine instead, as his father's death caused the family considerable hardship that a career as a physician was more likely to reverse.|$|E
25|$|Moro {{developed}} {{his interest in}} politics between 1943 and 1945. Initially, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{very interested in the}} social-democratic component of the Italian Socialist Party, but then his Catholic faith moved him towards the newly constituted Democrazia Cristiana (DC). In the DC, he took part {{in the work of the}} leftist trend, headed by Giuseppe Dossetti. In 1945 he became director of the magazine Studium and president of the Graduated Movement of the Azione Cattolica.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, Agha Mohammad Shah sent a {{force of}} 8,000 {{soldiers}} under Suleiman Khan Qajar, followed by Mirza Mehdi, to conquer Mashhad and affirm its citizens of the Shah's generosity. A day later, Agha Mohammad Shah, followed the customary of the famous Iranian shah Abbas I the Great, and entered Mashhad by foot as a pilgrim to the Imam Reza shrine, whilst being teary eyed and kissing the ground. His pilgrimage continued for 23 days, where <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unaware {{of the politics of}} the country.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand {{then came}} to tour England and Pietersen again {{struggled}} {{in the first}} two Test matches, scoring 3 in the first match. He improved slightly in the second but only making 26 in the first innings and then running himself out on 42 having looked well set. <b>He</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> struggling particularly against Daniel Vettori but he showed no signs of that as he struck a century in the third Test, forming a valuable partnership with Tim Ambrose, making a crucial 115. Pietersen hit a winning 42 not out in the Twenty20 match.|$|E
25|$|Caruso's health {{deteriorated}} further {{during the}} new year. He experienced episodes of intense pain {{because of the}} infection and underwent seven surgical procedures to drain fluid from his chest and lungs. He returned to Naples to recuperate from the most serious of the operations, during which part of a rib had been removed. According to Dorothy Caruso, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recovering, but {{allowed himself to be}} examined by an unhygienic local doctor and his condition worsened dramatically after that. The Bastianelli brothers, eminent medical practitioners with a clinic in Rome, recommended that his left kidney be removed. He {{was on his way to}} Rome to see them but, while staying overnight in the Vesuvio Hotel in Naples, he took an alarming turn for the worse and was given morphine to help him sleep.|$|E
25|$|Heinz Heydrich was an Obersturmführer (lieutenant), {{journalist}} {{and publisher of}} the soldiers' newspaper, Die Panzerfaust. He was at first a fervent admirer of Hitler. But before Reinhard Heydrich’s State funeral in Berlin in June 1942, Heinz Heydrich had been given a large packet containing his brother’s files, released from his strongbox at Gestapo Headquarters, 8 Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, Berlin. Heinz had shut himself away in his room with the papers. Next morning his wife noticed that her husband had sat up all night burning the documents from the package. Heinz, on leave from the front, could not be engaged in conversation, his wife remembered; <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> elsewhere mentally, and like stone. The files in the package were probably Reinhard Heydrich’s personal files, from which Heinz Heydrich understood {{for the first time in}} all its enormity the systematic extermination of the Jews, the so-called Final Solution. Thereafter, Heinz Heydrich helped many Jews escape by forging identity documents and printing them on Die Panzerfaust presses.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, King Khalid {{was not an}} {{effective}} leader. Although <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reluctant to rule the country initially, he later warmed to the throne and displayed an apparent interest in improving the education, health-care and infrastructure of the country during his seven-year reign. King Khalid is also considered {{to have been a}} genial caretaker during his reign. However, King Khalid failed to monopolize the power during his reign, leading to the empowerment of the princes who had been in powerful posts in late King Faisal's reign. He had some personal characteristics that made him a respected king. Although he did not have an active interest in affairs of state and his health was not good, he was admired as an honest man who managed to have good relations with the traditional establishment of Saudi Arabia. Therefore, he was granted support by other princes and powerful forces of the country.|$|E
500|$|After {{about three}} days, <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> feeling better; his blood work became normal and his {{diarrhea}} cleared up, {{but he still}} had low-grade fevers. Against the odds, his hoof X-rays came back showing no separation of the laminae, and no rotation or sinking of the coffin bone in any of his feet. [...] Although the cryotherapy had not prevented laminitis, it might have kept it from becoming worse. On September 21, the casts were removed from his legs. [...] The laminitis treatment was successful and his feet were returning to normal, raising hopes that he could race again some day.|$|E

James also wrote that he never understood St Hill as he did others: [...] "His eyes used to blaze when he was discussing a point with you; but even within his clipped sentences there were intervals when <b>he</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thinking of other things, far removed." ...|$|E
