40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to achieve the optimal parameters for producing forged aluminium alloy 7075 aircraft <b>door</b> <b>bracket</b> by using finite element modelling (FEM) with commercial DEFORM- 3 D V 6. 1 and physical simulations with plasticine and Plexiglas dies. Also, forging speed has been examined as the main factor for controlling to produce a part without any defects. The results of Physical Simulation showed that the flow pattern has good agreement with the results of FEM that based on the use of hydraulic presses with initial billet and dies temperatures 410 and 400 ° C, respectively, and different forging speeds 5, 10 and 15 mm/sec. Distribution of effective strain rate, effective strain, effective stress, temperature, forging force and dies­ wear showed improvement the results in forging speed of 5 mm/sec. Processing map of Aluminium alloy 7075 also checked out at constant strain 0. 5, indicated that the specified area of the forged part is located in a safe area. Forging force in optimized forging speed 5 mm/sec showed that the forging process using a 1000 -ton press can be done easil...|$|E

50|$|People under suicide watch are {{put into}} an {{environment}} {{where it would be}} difficult for them to hurt themselves. In many cases, any dangerous items will be removed from the area, such as sharp objects and some furniture, or they may be placed in a special padded cell, which has nothing outcropping from the walls (e.g., a clothes hook or <b>door</b> closing <b>bracket)</b> to provide a place for a ligature to be attached, and with only a drain-grill on the floor. They may be stripped of anything with which they might hurt themselves or use as noose, including shoelaces, belts, neckties, bras, shoes, socks, suspenders and bed sheets. In extreme cases the inmate may be undressed entirely.|$|R
5000|$|His {{citation}} for the Navy Cross reads in part: ...for extraordinary heroism {{during an}} extremely daring escape from a solitary confinement cell while a Prisoner of War in Hanoi, North Vietnam on October 12, 1967. During {{a period of}} particularly harsh treatment, Lieutenant Commander Coker and another prisoner executed an escape as a two-man team despite the high risk of brutal reprisal or possible loss of life. That night, after opening the cell door by removing <b>door</b> bolt <b>brackets</b> from inside the room, he proceeded over the wall and through several blocks of housing to the Domer Bridge. Walking under the bridge to the Red River's edge, he swam downstream all night and at sunrise buried himself in a mudbank {{in an effort to}} remain concealed. He was later discovered, recaptured, severely beaten for many hours, and banished to solitary confinement {{for two and a half}} years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{house was}} built in 1664 as the town house of the Earls of Shrewsbury who held control of the nearby Bridgegate. [...] It was also {{probably}} used as a grain warehouse because in the gable are double <b>doors</b> and a <b>bracket</b> for a hoist. The building became an inn in the 18th century, although it continued to be owned by the Shrewsbury family until 1867. [...] Its name is taken from the heraldic device of the Earls that consist of a bear tied to a billet (or stake).|$|R
50|$|The Three Lakes Patrol Cabin {{was built}} in 1934 in Mount Rainier National Park as a {{district}} ranger station. The log cabin was built to a standard plan designed by W.G. Carnes, Acting Chief Architect of the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs, supervised by Thomas Chalmers Vint. The cabin measures about 13.5 ft by 24 ft. It is a simple gable structure with a shed roof over the front <b>door,</b> supported by <b>brackets.</b> The eaves have a similar bracket detail. Log ends project prominently at the corners. It consists of a single room, unfinished apart from a wood floor.|$|R
50|$|The place remains highly intact {{externally}} and substantially intact internally, and {{is important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of early, purpose-designed, middle-class flats in Brisbane - including the domestic scale, design and layout; the garden setting; the inclusion of separate entrances and separate laundries; and the attention to aesthetic detail (including leadlights in the front entrance <b>doors,</b> decorative timber <b>brackets</b> to the internal picture and plate rails in the living and dining rooms, and early decorative wall and floor tiling to the original bathrooms). In addition, the location is illustrative {{of many of the}} principal concerns of investors in up-market flats, including: accessibility to public transport, workplaces, shops, schools and entertainment; aesthetics; and good light and ventilation.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1944 it {{appeared}} at a PRR exhibition in Chicago's Union Station entitled [...] "Presenting a Line of Modern Coal-Burning Steam Locomotives". At some {{time during the}} next year it {{lost much of its}} streamlining, the nosecone being removed in favor of a conventional PRR smokebox front including the keystone numberplate placed centrally on the small smokebox <b>door.</b> A headlamp <b>bracket</b> mounted above that door also hung the locomotive's bell. The side skirting was cut back to expose pipework and fittings for easier maintenance. The skyline casing atop the boiler remained in place.The Q1 remained in service until late 1946, after which it was placed in storage. It was dismantled around 1949.|$|R
5000|$|The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Combination Depot-Hornick, {{also known}} as the Hornick Depot, is a {{historic}} building located in Hornick, Iowa, United States. The town was patted by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad's land company when the railroad created a branch line from Manilla, Iowa to Sioux City. Completed in 1887, the railroad built this two-story frame structure to serve as its passenger and freight depot. It is one of six such depots that remain in Iowa, and the best preserved. [...] These buildings were built from a standard design used by the railroad. The two-story stations included living quarters for the station manager because the towns had yet to develop when the depot was built. [...] This was an island depot, with freight loaded on the north side and passengers boarded on the south. Decorative elements on this depot include lathe-turned wooden finials, angled wooden <b>brackets,</b> and <b>bracketed</b> <b>door</b> and window hoods. Passenger service ended in the 1950s, and grain was loaded here until 1980 when the Milwaukee Road abandoned the Sioux City branch line. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It has been converted into a local history museum.|$|R
50|$|The Church of Saint Peter (12th century) was {{the main}} element of a Benedictine priory. It {{was part of the}} former diocese of Saintes and belonged to the abbey of Baignes. Its nave, which has no pilaster, covered by a ceiling is next to a false square from the 11th century. The choir with a flat chevet is surmounted by a vault from the late 15th century mounted on heavy ribs. Only the choir has three windows, two of them - {{the north and the south}} - are broken and one has three transoms and {{flamboyant}} latticework. The side walls are pierced with fake square arches leading into two Gothic chapels with two bays extending along the nave. The South has three keyhole arches and three columns with capitals decorated with small leaves from the end of the 14th century. The Cylindrical baptismal font with ornate ring moldings dates from the 16th century. The facade has a door and three open arches. The first floor is decorated with three arches. The north chapel has a <b>door</b> with curly <b>brackets</b> on its west wall. Buttresses reinforce the corners of the chapels and the chevet. The rectangular bell tower is on the first floor with its faces pierced with two bays. The second floor has a rectangular bay and is surmounted by a cornice and a hipped roof on four sides.|$|R
