50|$|<b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis,</b> {{commonly}} known as the Norwegian skate or black skate, is a species of skate found in the Norwegian Sea, North Sea and the Bay of Biscay. It is occasionally encountered off the western coast of Ireland, and historically has been found near Rockall and in the Norwegian Deep, though recent surveys have not identified the species there. It inhabits waters from 200m to over 1000m in depth. In 2010, researchers reported the species in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{confirms}} {{the presence of}} the Norwegian skate <b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis</b> (Storm, 1881) in the Mediterranean Sea, by means of morphological traits and molecular markers providing the first record of this species in the Alboran Sea. Cannas et al. (2010) reported D. nidarosiensis {{for the first time in}} the Mediterranean from specimens captured in the central western basin, but Ebert & Stehmann (2013) and Stehmann et al. (2015) considered these records "likely refer to the smaller morphotype, Dipturus sp. ", a species not yet described. Eight specimens of the Dipturus genus (Rajiformes: Rajidae) were caught off the Alboran Island (western Mediterranean) in 2012, 2013 and 2016, between 620 and 819 m depth. These specimens showed morphometric diagnostic features corresponding to those of Norwegian skates from the Northeast Atlantic and the central western Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, the Alboran individuals were genetically compared to Northeast Atlantic specimens available in GenBank by means of two mitochondrial DNA fragments: cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb). Analyses showed that the Northeast Atlantic Norwegian skate specimens and the Alboran Sea ones were genetically similar and shared haplotypes, corroborating the identification of the Alboran individuals as <b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis.</b> However, they were different from other Dipturus species distributed throughout the Northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea. Our results confirm the occurrence of this deep-sea large skate species in the Mediterranean, although the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species does not consider it possible (Stehmann et al., 2015) Versión del edito...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-three <b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis</b> (Collett, 1880) (Elasmobranchii: Rajidae) were {{collected}} off {{the coasts of}} Sardinia between 550 m and 1688 m of depth in 2005 - 2011. A first description of some biological aspects as the vertical distribution, the reproduction and the diet of the Norwegian skate from the Central Western Mediterranean is provided. Females attained a greater length than males, they mature at larger sizes and were found mature always at depths of 550 - 600 m {{in the same area}} of the Southern coast of Sardinia. The diet of D. nidarosiensis was based almost entirely on decapod crustaceans and completed by bony fish...|$|E

The main species in biomass terms in this survey were Galeus melastomus (blackmouth catshark), Deania calcea (birdbeak dogfish), Deania profundorum (arrowhead dogfish), Scyliorhinus canicula (lesser spotted dogfish), Scymnodon ringens (Knifetooth dogfish), Etmopterus spinax (velvet belly lantern shark), Dalatias licha (Kitefin shark) Hexanchus griseus (bluntnose sixgill shark), Leucoraja circularis (sandy ray), Leucoraja naevus (cuckoo ray), <b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis</b> (Norwegian skate) and Dipturus spp. / Dipturus cf. flossada / Dipturus cf. intermedia (common skate). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed. Many of these species occupy mainly the deep areas covered in the survey, especially D. calcea, D. profundorum and S. ringens...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFourteen {{specimens}} of the Norwegian skate, <b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis</b> (Rajiformes, Rajidae), were caught off the Sardinian coasts (Central Western Mediterranean Sea) in 2005 - 2008 between 600 and 1420 m of depth. Their identification {{has been confirmed}} by the sequencing of three regions of the mtDNA (16 SrDNA, control region and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1) and comparison of the obtained sequences with that of three species of Dipturus (D. batis, D. oxyrinchus and D. nidarosiensis) from the Mediterranean Sea and the adjacent North-eastern Atlantic Ocean. A simple PCR-RFLP assay has been developed for an easy, reliable and robust identification of these skate species. A morphological comparison of the Norwegian skate with congeneric species is given {{in order to help}} future identifications. This is the first record ofD. nidarosiensis in the Mediterranean Sea; the possibility of recent or ancient but unnoticed occurrence of the Norwegian skate in the region is discusse...|$|E
40|$|This working {{document}} {{presents the results}} on the most significant elasmobranch species of the Porcupine Bank Spanish surveys in 2014 and updates the documents presented in previous years with {{the information in the}} whole historical series from 2001. The main species in biomass terms in this survey were Galeus melastomus (blackmouth catshark), Deania calcea (birdbeak dogfish), Scymnodon ringens (Knifetooth dogfish), <b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis</b> (Norwegian skate), Scyliorhinus canicula (lesser spotted dogfish), Etmopterus spinax (velvet belly lantern shark), Hexanchus griseus (bluntnose sixgill shark), Dalatias licha (Kitefin shark), Leucoraja circularis (sandy ray), Dipturus cf. flossada, Leucoraja naevus (cuckoo ray) and Dipturus cf. intermedia (common skate). Biomass, distribution and length ranges were analysed for these species. All the species analysed increased its biomass in 2014, except S. canicula and D. cf. flossada that decreased. D. calcea individuals smaller than 65 cm were captured again in 2014 after not having been captured the previous year, although catches were very low. Raja brachyura was recorded {{for the first time in}} the survey area...|$|E
40|$|Eggcases {{of eight}} rajiform skates (<b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis,</b> D. oxyrinchus, Leucoraja melitensis, Raja asterias, R. brachyura, R. clavata, R. miraletus and R. polystigma) {{present in the}} central-western Mediterranean are described, based on speci- mens {{obtained}} from shery surveys. Eggcase features such as dimensions, horns and apron lengths, and presence/ absence of lateral keels were crucial to discriminate the eggcases of the various species. Morphological and morpho- metric data, con rmed by the multivariate analysis, indicated that the eggcase of R. miraletus and L. melitensis were distinct {{from those of the}} other species for being unkeeled. Within the species having keeled eggcases, those of the genus Dipturus and R. brachyura were discriminated from the remaining group by having the largest dimensions and aprons. Sandy bottoms (< 100 – 150 m depth) were identi ed as egg-laying sites (i. e. sites with females bearing eggcases in uteri) for many species belonging to genus Raja Raja asterias, R. brachyura, R. miraletus and R. polystigma). The nding of R. asterias and R. miraletus carrying eggcases yearly on the same sites, seems to con rm the theory that many rajid species demonstrate site delity, returning to the same depositional area on an annual basis. Some remarks on reproductive biology of these skates are also provided. The eggcase identi cation key reported here repre- sents the rst for the Mediterranean and may be useful, in the future, to identify egg-laying grounds of skates with a nonlethal method...|$|E
40|$|Elasmobranchs are an {{important}} by-catch of commercial fisheries targeting bony fishes. Fisheries targeting sharks are rare, but usually almost all specimen bycatched are marketed. They risk extinction if current fishing pressure continues (Ferretti et al., 2008). Accurate species identification is critical {{for the design of}} sustainable fisheries and appropriate management plans, especially since not all species are equally sensitive to fishing pressure (Walker & Hislop 1998). The identification of species constitutes the first basic step for biodiversity monitoring and conservation (Dayrat B et al., 2005). More recently, mtDNA sequencing has also been used for species identification and its use has become widespread under the DNA Barcode initiative (e. g. Hebert et al. 2003 a, 2003 b; Ward et al. 2005, 2008 a; Moura et al 2008; Steinke et al. 2009). The aims of this work were: 1) identify sharks and skates species using DNA barcode; 2) compare species of different provenance; 3) use DNA barcode for misidentified species. Using DNA barcode 15 species of sharks (Alopias vulpinus, Centrophorus granulosus, Cetorhinus maximus, Dalatias licha, Etmopterus spinax, Galeorhinus galeus, Galeus melastomus, Heptranchias perlo, Hexanchus griseus, Mustelus mustelus, Mustelus punctulatus, Oxynotus centrina, Scyliorhinus canicula Squalus acanthias, Squalus blainville), 1 species of chimaera (Chimaera monstrosa) and 21 species of rays/skayes (Dasyatis centroura, Dasyatis pastinaca, Dasyatis sp., <b>Dipturus</b> <b>nidarosiensis,</b> Dipturus oxyrinchus, Leucoraja circularis, Leucoraja melitensis, Myliobatis aquila, Pteromylaeus bovinus, Pteroplatytrygon violacea, Raja asterias, Raja brachyura, Raja clavata, Raja miraletus, Raja montagui, Raja radula, Raja polystigma, Raja undulata, Rostroraja alba, Torpedo marmorata, Torpedo nobiliana, Torpedo torpedo) was identified...|$|E
