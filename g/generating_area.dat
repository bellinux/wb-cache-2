40|$|Gravity waves {{generated}} by severe thunderstorms {{in the eastern}} Ohio-Pennsylvania area were recorded by an array of microbarovariographs at Palisades, New York and by standard microbarographs across northeastern United States. The waves {{were associated with the}} cold mesohigh from the outflow of the thunderstorms. Along their path the waves apparently triggered new thunderstorms. The waves were observed to propagate with the velocity of the wind just below the tropopause. The long-distance propagation of the waves is explained by the presence of a dust associated with the critical level (steering level), in agreement with the derivations given by Lindzen and Tung (1976). The dust was directional and waves were absent {{to the west of the}} <b>generating</b> <b>area.</b> In the <b>generating</b> <b>area</b> wave-CISK might have been operating.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe spectral method of sea and swell wave forecasting yields more meaningful results than do other forecasting methods. To shorten {{the time required}} to make such a forecast the authors used high-speed computer methods and the Piers on-Neumann-James spectra to make spectral forecasts and display the results in graphic form for several synoptic weather models and a wide range of wind and fetch speeds. Forecasts were completed for a stationary fetch model, a fetch moving to leeward and a fetch moving to windward. Computations were made with the assumptions that a rectangular <b>generating</b> <b>area</b> could be delineated; that a spatially-uniform mean wind existed; that this wind did not increase or decrease until the time of forecast; and finally that if the fetch were moving, its movement was steady. The following parameter limits were established: a. wind speeds, 15 to 55 knots; b. speed of the <b>generating</b> <b>area,</b> 15 knots to and including the wind speed; c. forecast times, 6 to 72 hours. Results of the forecasts are plotted on approximately 250 graphs which show the geographic distribution of spectral sea or swell components relative to the fetch at forecast times.

40|$|In {{looking at}} the videos of the Indonesian tsunami coming ashore at various locations, I thought, “That’s {{a lot of water}} with a lot of {{momentum}}, and that’s what does the damage. ” Perhaps the momentum of a tsunami might be a physical quantity to focus on. Only external forces on the designated body of water create its momentum. Within the body of water, turbulence, internal friction and laminar flow involve internal forces and are not relevant. This could be particularly useful in the <b>generating</b> <b>area.</b> There could be external forces on a designated body of water from a landslide, a pyroclastic flow, an explosion, from steam generation and from chunks of matter falling into the ocean. The horizontal components of those forces result in horizontal momentums. Ultimately when the wave moves out from the <b>generating</b> <b>area</b> and the internal turbulence and laminar flow get dissipated by friction, in the remaining long wave motion the wave height is simply related to the horizontal momentum. The horizontal momentum contribution to the directionality of the wave would be narrower than that due only to the initial vertical displacement. Focusing on the momentum description of the tsunami introduces many new kinds of physical problems that are interesting in themselves...|$|E

The Fouta Djallon is the main West African hydrographic source area. The two principal rivers (Niger and Senegal) take birth in this region where, in addition, {{one of the highest}} cumulative rain heights in the world (> 10 m) is observed.
