50|$|The {{issue of}} {{handling}} toxic waste {{has become a}} global problem as international trade has arisen out of the increasing toxic byproducts produced with the transfer of them to less developed countries. In 1995, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights began to notice the illicit dumping of toxic waste and assigned a Special Rapporteur to examine the human rights aspect to this issue (Commission resolution 1995/81). In September 2011, the Human Rights Council decided to strengthen the mandate to include the entire life-cycle of hazardous products from manufacturing to final destination (aka cradle to grave), as opposed to only movement and dumping of hazardous waste. The title of the Special Rapporteur has been changed to the “Special Rapporteur on the implications for human rights of the <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> management and <b>disposal</b> of hazardous substances and wastes."(Human Rights Council 18/11).

EPA proposed that the following three types of hazardous wastes be managed as universal wastes: batteries, certain pesticides, and thermostats. Because EPA believed that the authority to propose the promulgation of the universal waste rule was not significantly linked to HSWA provisions, the Agency proposed the promulgation of the universal waste rule under pre-HSWA authority.

40|$|Today, over consumption, {{pollution}} and resource depletion threaten sustainability. Waste management policies frequently fail to reduce consumption, prevent pollution, conserve resources and foster sustainable products – {{as seen in}} the context of managing end-of-life refrigerators and appliances containing ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). However, waste policies are changing to focus on lifecycle impacts of products from the cradle to the grave by extending responsibilities of stakeholders to post-consumer management. Product stewardship and extended producer responsibility are two policies in use, with radically different results when compared for one consumer product, refrigerators. North America has enacted product stewardship policies that fail to require producers to take physical or financial responsibility for recycling or for <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>disposal,</b> so that releases of ozone depleting substances routinely occur, which contribute to the expanding the ozone hole. Conversely, Europe’s Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive requires extended producer responsibility, whereby producers collect and manage their own post-consumer waste products.

However, how far this convention will be applicable for all aspects of transboundary movement of end-of-life ships is still, {{at least in the}} view of some scholars, a debatable issue. Against this backdrop, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has adopted a new, legally binding convention for shipbreaking. There is a rising voice from the developing countries that the convention is likely to impose more obligations on recycling facilities in the developing countries than on shipowners from rich nations.

40|$|Obsolete {{pesticide}} stocks pose {{a serious}} threat to {{public health and the environment}} as storage conditions rarely meet international standards. In many countries, pesticide containers are kept in the open where containers deteriorate and leak their contents, which contaminate soil, surface water and groundwater. Many of the chemicals are so toxic that a few grams could poison thousands of people or contaminate a large area, and as most stores are in urban areas, the danger this poses is considerable. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), donor countries, aid agencies, agrochemical companies and recipient governments are all responsible for the steady accumulation of obsolete pesticides in developing countries. FAO estimates that there are more than 100, 000 tonnes of these substances in developing countries: 20, 000 tons in Africa alone. Some stocks are over 30 years old and, due to the absence of <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>disposal</b> facilities, stocks are constantly increasing. FAO has recently disposed of some 370 tonnes of unused pesticides in Zambia and Seychelles as part of its on-going programme to help developing countries clean up obsolete pesticides. Storage sites were cleaned and highly dangerous and persistent chemicals, including DDT, Lindane, Dieldrin, Atrazine, Diazinon, Captan, Malathion and Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were shipped to Europe for incineration. FAO received financial assistance from the Dutch Government and the German Technical Cooperation Agency (GTZ) for the operation, which cost US$ 1. 3 million. The cost of disposing of obsolete pesticides stocks in Africa alone are estimated to exceed US$ 100 million. FAO is currently seeking financial support from agro-industry companies for pilot disposal operations in the Gambia (20 tonnes), Senegal (300 tonnes) and Botswana (200 tonnes). None of the developing countries has facilities for the safe and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>disposal</b> of pesticides, which requires high-temperature incineration. The long-term solution to the problem lies in preventing the accumulation of these obsolete materials; stocks should be kept as low as possible and pesticide use should be drastically reduced. FAO has prepared Guidelines on The prevention and accumulation of obsolete pesticides; Pesticide storage; Stock control and Disposal of bulk quantities of obsolete pesticides which are available in Arabic, English, French and Spanish.

The hypothesis is that Swedish popular media representations of digital technologies contribute to fuelling an understanding of these technologies as resource-free, consumable goods, and that this in turn might affect peoples ’ tendencies to stockpile obsolete digital technologies in their homes. Previous {{studies have shown that}} stockpiling of obsolete electrical and electronic equipment is a common phenomenon in many countries (see for comparison Grossman, 2006; Saphores et al., 2006, 2009; Lescak, 2008; Gabrys, 2011). At the same time, little light is shed on why people stockpile obsolete electrical and electronic equipment in their homes. This article focuses particularly on digital technologies such as computers, televisions, smart phones, cell phones, laptops and tablets. Digital technologies are interesting as they account for a large – and increasing – amount of electrical and electronic equipment. Looking at the ways in which Swedish popular media represent digital technologies, this article suggests that popular media representations of digital technologies matter, not only in the ways people imagine and use digital technologies, but also the ways in which we think (or choose not to think) about their afterlife.

40|$|Project Overview: The {{current state}} of play shows that the {{national}} implementation of the EU directives on the <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>disposal</b> of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and End of Life Vehicles (ELV) differs among European countries. This poses a particular challenge for the Centrope region (covering the eastern parts of Austria and the Czech Republic, {{as well as the}} western parts of Slovakia and Hungary), since it makes cross-border cooperation more complicated. With a view to geographic proximity, however, cross-border cooperation suggests itself for these countries, since material flows can be easily transported within the "Vienna Basin", the "Little Hungarian Plain" and neighboring regions. In January 2006, a project called "Recycling Network Centrope" has been set up to intensify the business contacts between Austrian, Hungarian, Slovakian and Czech companies. Primary project objective is to analyze the existing structures of the recycling market in the Centrope region to identify cooperation opportunities for the companies involved. Thus, solutions can be found to mutual problems, by making better use of and sharing the knowledge available in the regions. Solving the existing problems (e. g. recycling of CRT glass, plastics, etc. through joint efforts would cut down recycling costs in Centrope. The project, which was funded by the BMWA/FFG through the CIR-CE "Innovation networks with Central and Eastern Europe" program, involved 14 project partners: seven from Austria, three from Hungary and foud from Slovakia.

40|$|Management of the nation’s {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) {{continues to be a}} high priority issue for many communities as we near the turn of the century. Increasingly, the concept of integrated solid waste management—source reduction of wastes before they enter the waste stream, recovery of generated wastes for recycling and composting, and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>disposal</b> through combustion facilities and landfills that meet current standards—is being used by communities as they plan for the future. There are many regional variations that require each community to examine its own waste management needs. Such factors as local and regional availability of suitable landfill space, proximity of markets for recovered materials, population density, commercial and industrial activity, and climatic and groundwater variations all may motivate each community to make its own plans. Identifying the components of the waste stream is an important step toward addressing the issues associated with the generation and management of {{municipal solid}} wastes. MSW characterizations, which analyze the quantity and composition of the {{municipal solid waste}} stream, involve estimating how much MSW is generated, recycled, combusted, and disposed of in landfills. By determining the makeup of the waste stream, waste characterizations also provide valuable data for setting waste management goals, tracking progress toward those goals, and supporting planning at the national, state, and local levels. For example, waste characterizations can be used to highlight opportunities for source reduction and recycling and provide information on any special management issues that should be considered. Readers should note that this report characterizes the municipal solid waste stream of the nation as a whole. Local and regional variations are not addressed, but suggestions for use of the information in this report by local planners are included i...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{incremental}} impacts of coal ash and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) wastes associated with increased coal usage by utilities and industry under the National Energy Plan (NEP). In the paper, 1985 and 2000 are the assessment points using the baseline data taken from the Annual Environmental Analysis Report (AEAR, September 1977). In each EPA region, the potential mix of disposal options has been broadly estimated and impacts assessed therefrom. In addition, future use of advanced combustion techniques has been taken into account. The quantities of coal ash and FGD wastes depend on ash and sulfur content of the coal, emission regulations, the types of ash collection and FGD systems, and operating conditions of the systems and boiler. The disposal of these wastes is (or will be) subject to Federal and State regulations. The one key legal framework concerning environmental impact on land is the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RCRA and related Federal and State laws provide a sufficient statutory basis for preventing significant adverse health and environmental impacts from coal ash and FGD waste disposal. However, much of {{the development and implementation}} of specific regulations lie ahead. FGD wastes and coal ash and FGD wastes are currently disposed of exclusively on land. The most common land disposal methods are inpoundments (ponds) and landfills, although some mine disposal is also practiced. The potential environmental impacts of this disposal are dependent on the characteristics of the disposal site, characteristics of the coal ash and FGD wastes, control method and the degree of control employed. In general, the major potential impacts are ground and surface water contamination and the "degradation" of large quantities of land. However, assuming land is available for disposal of these wastes, control technology exists for <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>disposal.</b> Because of existing increases in coal use, the possibility of significant environmental impacts, both regionally and nationally, exists regardless of whether the NEP scenario develops or not. Existing baseline data indicate that with sound control technology and successful development and implementation of existing regulatory framework, regional scale impacts are likely to be small; however, site-specific impacts could be significant and need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Both Federal and privately-funded programs are developing additional data and information on disposal of FGD sludges and coal ash. Continuation of these programs will provide additional vital information in the future. However, further information in several areas if desirable: further data on levels of radionuclides and trace metals in these wastes: studies on biological impacts of trace metals; and completion of current and planned studies on disposal problems associated with advanced combustion techniques like fluid bed combustion...|$|E

This one work has as main objective to diagnose the situation of solid waste home and health services in the villages Central, New and St. Anthony in MaracanaÃ, Enchanted Lagoon, in Singapore, and Varjota, Tapera, Blender and Mixer II, Itarema, in Ceara state, proposing reduction of viable techniques of waste generation and of <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> <b>disposal.</b> To characterize the environment of indigenous health study, a history was presented from the first protective actions to the health of Indian to this day, with the Special Secretariat of Indigenous Health - SESA. The methodology work, visits were made to villages, questionnaires, studies composition of the waste, interviews with those responsible for managing the prefectures and statistical analysis of the data obtained. As a result, it was observed that there gathering for household waste in most villages, but the waste of health services They are collected correctly. Aquiraz and MaracanaÃ have landfill and Itarema, dump. THE main form of waste disposal in the villages are burnt and there is the presence of disease vectors in most homes. Wastes that might not reverse logistics They are aimed correctly. The villages have high numbers of homes with breeding and growing crops. As for environmental education, the concept of Recycling is further known that the concept of composting. The practice of segregation waste is not common in the villages. The per capita generation of household waste is among 0. 60 and 0. 80 kg / inhab. / Day. As conclusions, the municipalities of MaracanaÃ and have Aquiraz structure sufficient to meet the villages on the {{management of}} waste, but Itarema must be better analyzed. In the villages educational actions must be performed environmental, designed to prepare the population for implementing collection programs selective and composting. The Sanitation Indigenous Agent - AISAN is a professional, properly trained, can be of great support to solid waste management in the villages indigenous. Finally, as a recommendation should be made more work with this same methodology as they are few and the work is to be extended to more villages CearÃ, and for other villages of Special Indigenous Health Districts - DSEI. THE DSEI and partnership between municipalities is of great value, for only then, all stages of management may be performed, ensuring a healthy environment and quality of life indigenous peoples.

Como conclusÃes, os municÃpios de MaracanaÃ e Aquiraz possuem estrutura suficiente para atender as aldeias quanto ao gerenciamento dos resÃduos, porÃm Itarema deve ser melhor analisada. Nas aldeias devem ser realizadas aÃÃes de educaÃÃo ambiental, visando Ã preparaÃÃo da populaÃÃo para implantaÃÃo de programas de coleta seletiva e compostagem. O Agente IndÃgena de Saneamento - AISAN Ã um profissional que, corretamente capacitado, pode ser de grande apoio Ã gestÃo de resÃduos sÃlidos nas aldeias indÃgenas. Por fim, como recomendaÃÃo, devem ser realizados mais trabalhos com essa mesma metodologia, pois sÃo poucos e esses trabalhos devem ser ampliados para mais aldeias do CearÃ, como para aldeias de outros Distritos SanitÃrios Especiais IndÃgenas - DSEI. A parceria entre DSEI e prefeituras Ã de grande valia, pois sÃ assim, todas as etapas do gerenciamento poderÃo ser executadas, garantindo um ambiente saudÃvel e qualidade de vida Ãs populaÃÃes indÃgenas...|$|E
