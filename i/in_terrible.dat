5|$|Varvara Dobroselova and Makar Devushkin {{are second}} cousins twice-removed and live {{across from each}} other on the same street <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> apartments. Devushkin's, for example, is merely a portioned-off section of the kitchen, and he lives with several other tenants, such as the Gorshkovs, whose son who groans in agonizing hunger almost the entire story and {{eventually}} dies. Devushkin and Dobroselova exchange letters attesting to their terrible living conditions and the former frequently squanders his money on gifts for her.|$|E
5|$|Stewie is <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> {{pain from}} {{teething}} and cannot find comfort anywhere. When his mother Lois {{tells him that}} his pain will ultimately pass, it gives him the idea to build a machine that will move time forward {{to the point where}} his teething will have already stopped. Meanwhile, Lois tells Peter to drive their other son Chris to his soccer match, then come right back to look after Stewie. However, Peter's friend Quagmire is there, and has brought beer, so Peter decides to ignore Lois and stay at the game. While there, another member of the crowd insults Chris. Enraged, Peter punches this person in the face, only to discover that it is a pregnant woman who looks and sounds like a man.|$|E
5|$|Following British defeats at the First and Second Battles of Gaza in March and April 1917, Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode {{commanding}} the EEF's Eastern Force and Kress von Kressenstein's Ottoman Empire force had each adopted a defensive posture and a stalemate had developed in Southern Palestine. Entrenched defences approximately {{on the lines}} held {{at the end of}} the second battle were strengthened, and both sides undertook regular mounted reconnaissances into the open eastern flank. In late June, Allenby replaced General Archibald Murray as commander of the EEF, which he quickly reorganised. At about the same time, the Ottoman Fourth Army was also restructured. As the stalemate continued <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> conditions through the summer, reinforcements began to arrive to replace the large number of casualties suffered by the EEF during the previous fighting for Gaza, while several additional divisions also arrived. The Ottoman defenders were also reinforced at this time, and both sides carried out training while manning the front lines and monitoring the open eastern flank. By mid-October, as the Battle of Passchendaele continued on the Western Front, the last of the British reinforcements arrived as Allenby's preparations to commence a campaign of manoeuvre neared completion.|$|E

25|$|Hastings had {{suffered}} {{over the years}} {{from the lack of}} a natural harbour, and there have been attempts to create a sheltered harbour.

25|$|The {{persecution}} of Quakers in North America began in 1656 when English Quaker missionaries Mary Fisher and Ann Austin began preaching in Boston. They were considered heretics {{because of their}} insistence on individual obedience to the Inner Light. They were imprisoned and banished by the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Their books were burned, and most of their property was confiscated. They were imprisoned <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> conditions, then deported.|$|E
25|$|The {{night was}} spent <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> anxiety and {{extraordinary}} human effort. The fires, from hour to hour progressed rampantly, irresistibly bearing down everything which came {{within range of}} their power, checked only providentially. The authorities moved, throughout, with all speed at their disposal, directed by the two Mayors, with assistance from men of the councils; members of the Board of Guardians; two fire brigades, and officers and men of the local garrison.|$|E
25|$|Food {{supplies}} were frequently <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> condition, infested with mould, weevils, worms, and maggots. Provisions were frequently destroyed by rats, and their containers were too fragile {{to sustain a}} long ocean voyage or the rigors of campaigning. The climate was also against the British in the southern colonies and the Caribbean, where the intense summer heat caused food supplies to sour and spoil. British troops stationed in America were often {{on the verge of}} starvation.|$|E

25|$|In 1831, one of {{his sons}} died. Brown fell ill, and his {{businesses}} began to suffer, leaving him <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> debt. In the summer of 1832, shortly after the death of a newborn son, his wife Dianthe died. On June 14, 1833, Brown married 16-year-old Mary Ann Day (April 15, 1817 â€“ May 1, 1884), originally from Washington County, New York. They eventually had 13 children, in addition to the seven children from his previous marriage.|$|E

A woman warns him he is <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> danger. A porter then takes him to the ritual room, where a disguised red-cloaked Master of Ceremonies confronts Bill with a question about a second password. Bill says he has forgotten it. The masked woman {{who had tried to}} warn Bill intervenes and insists that she will redeem him. Bill is ushered from the mansion and warned not to tell anyone about what happened there.|$|E
25|$|While testing {{an early}} 1.5m set the team failed to detect any aircraft, but easily picked out large objects like cranes and ships at nearby wharves. Further {{experiments}} demonstrated {{the ability to}} pick up ships at sea, leading to a live demonstration where the team was able to track down Royal Navy capital ships <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> weather. This led to immediate interest on behalf of RAF Coastal Command which saw this {{as a way to}} find enemy ships and U-Boats, and by the British Army, which was interested in using the radars to direct fire against shipping in the English Channel. Work on the system for AI use largely ended.|$|E

25|$|In Poland, Seel parted {{ways with}} the Russian army and joined {{a group of}} {{concentration}} camp survivors soon to be brought back to France. The Red Cross soon took over and organised a train convoy. This however did not go west but south, through Odessa and the Black Sea, <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> sanitary conditions. Seel was still in Poland on 8 May 1945 when the Armistice was declared. In Odessa, as he {{was put in charge}} of order in the refugee camp he was in, he contracted malaria. At this time he was also advised to change his name to Celle and hide {{the fact that he was}} Alsatian by saying he was from Belfort.|$|E
25|$|The third book {{provides}} more {{details of the}} love triangle that has erupted between Fyodor, his son Dmitri, and Grushenka. Dmitri's personality is explored in the conversation between him and Alyosha as Dmitri hides near his father's home to see if Grushenka will arrive. Later that evening, Dmitri bursts into his father's house and assaults him while threatening {{to come back and}} kill him in the future. This book also introduces Smerdyakov and his origins, as well as the story of his mother, Reeking Lizaveta. At the conclusion of this book, Alyosha is witness to Grushenka's bitter humiliation of Dmitri's betrothed Katerina, resulting <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> embarrassment and scandal for this proud woman.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the squad}} were disappointing though. Of the other batsmen, only Smith {{averaged}} over 30, and that was flattered by his big century at Antigua. He was <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> form {{for the vast majority}} of the tour. Ramprakash averaged just over 10 in four Tests â€“ a poor return for a man of his talents. None of the other bowlers impressed at all â€“ Salisbury picked up seven wickets, but they were expensive, and Igglesden and Malcolm showed little to earn continued selection in the Tests in their brief appearances. Steve Watkin didn't even get that chance in the Test series, despite his fine end to the 1993 Ashes, after an early injury gave the impetus to others.|$|E

25|$|When Germany invaded Norway in 1940, TromsÃ¸ served {{briefly as}} {{the seat of}} the Norwegian government. General Carl Gustav Fleischer arrived in TromsÃ¸ on 10 April 1940 after flying <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> conditions. From TromsÃ¸ he issued orders for total {{civilian}} and military mobilisation and declared Northern Norway a theatre of war. Fleischer's strategic plan was to first wipe out the German forces at Narvik and then transfer his division to Nordland to meet a German advance from TrÃ¸ndelag. The Germans eventually captured all of Norway, after allied support had been withdrawn, although they encountered fierce resistance from the Finnmark-based Alta Battalion at Narvik. TromsÃ¸ escaped the war unscathed, although the German battleship Tirpitz was sunk by the RAF off the TromsÃ¸y island on 12 November 1944, killing close to 1,000 German sailors.|$|E
25|$|This {{period was}} also characterised {{by the first}} contact between the Sicilian mafia (the crime {{syndicate}} also known as Cosa Nostra) and the Italian government. The Mafia's origins are still uncertain, but it is generally accepted that it emerged in the 18th century initially {{in the role of}} private enforcers hired to protect the property of landowners and merchants from the groups of bandits (briganti) who frequently pillaged the countryside and towns. The battle against the Mafia made by the Kingdom of Italy was controversial and ambiguous. The Carabinieri (the military police of Italy) and sometimes the Italian army were often involved <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> fights against the mafia members, but their efforts were frequently useless because of the secret co-operation between mafia and local government and also because of the weakness of the Italian judicial system.|$|E
25|$|Woods's {{inconsistent}} {{play in the}} 2010 FedEx Cup playoffs {{failed to}} qualify him into the top 30 players for The Tour Championship, {{for the first time}} since he turned professional in 1996. He had won the FedEx Cup in 2007 and 2009. He also failed to qualify on points for the 2010 Ryder Cup team, for the first time in his career. But captain Corey Pavin chose Woods as one of his four captain's picks. Woods, again partnering with Steve Stricker in pairs play, played inconsistently <b>in</b> <b>terrible</b> weather conditions at Celtic Manor in Wales; the matches were delayed several times when the course became unplayable, and the format had to be significantly modified and then even extended to a fourth day to complete the event. The U.S., entering as Cup holders, lost the Cup to the European team, by the narrowest possible margin, 14.5 to 13.5. However, Woods played impressive golf in his final-day singles match, winning decisively over Francesco Molinari.|$|E
