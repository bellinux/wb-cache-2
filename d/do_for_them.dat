2500|$|Propelled by {{a string}} of hit singles, Tango in the Night became the band's biggest album since Rumours a decade earlier. However, {{following}} its release, Buckingham left Fleetwood Mac largely because of his desire not to tour and the strain he was feeling within the band. [...] "I needed to get some separation from Stevie especially, because I don't think I'd ever quite gotten closure on our relationship," [...] he said. [...] "I needed {{to get on with}} the next phase of my creative growth and my emotional growth. When you break up with someone and then for the next 10 years you have to be around them and <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> and watch them move away from you, it's not easy." [...] Fleetwood Mac continued without him, and Buckingham was replaced by guitarists Rick Vito and Billy Burnette.|$|E

2500|$|After {{referring}} to the bequest of the Outhwaite family and making placatory remarks about the Marist Brothers, Liston welcomed the Christian Brothers. He {{said that they were}} [...] "here at the invitation of the Bishop to take charge of St Peter's school and to have their part, along with the Marist Brothers and other religious communities, in our Catholic education system. They have their own traditions to give us, formed in the society's work of teaching since 1802, and the fruit of the experience gathered, to speak only of Australia and New Zealand, of over 500 Brothers teaching more than 20,000 boys". Liston added, [...] " ... if I know the Brothers at all, the boys under their care will be put to hard work - an excellent thing - and teachers will not <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> what they should do for themselves. The thought of the years ahead and of the eternal life will be regarded as of first importance. Teachers will feel it their daily duty to fit the boys to bear life's burdens with a spirit of nobility and to meet life's problems with unfaltering courage". At the conclusion of his speech, Bishop Liston said, [...] "This is a very happy day for me indeed for I owe much more than I can say to the training I received {{at the hands of the}} Christian Brothers in Dunedin long years ago".|$|E
2500|$|Family {{formed in}} Late 1966 in Leicester, England from the {{remaining}} {{members of a}} group that was previously known as The Farinas and later briefly The Roaring Sixties, whose sound was grounded in R. The Farinas originally consisted of John [...] "Charlie" [...] Whitney, Tim Kirchin (born c. 1944, Birstall, Leicestershire died c. 2000), Harry Ovenall (born Richard Harry Ovenall, 12 September 1943, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire) and Jim King, forming at Leicester Art College in 1962. Ric Grech replaced Kirchin on bass in 1965 and Roger Chapman joined the following year on vocals. The American record producer Kim Fowley suggested they call themselves [...] "The Family" [...] as they regularly wore double-breasted suits in performances, giving themselves a mafia appearance, a look they soon abandoned in favour a more casual dress code. They played the famous Marquee Club regularly and other London clubs including The Hundred Club and the famous Sybilla's in Swallow Street where they met Henrietta Guinness who introduced them into society. On meeting Mim Scala who they had known before, Scala asked if there was anything he could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> Because they were looking for material at the time, and probably a producer, Ovenall asked Scala if he could arrange for Jimmy Miller to produce the first single which he duly did. Scala also introduced them to John Gilbert, who from then on took over managing the band. Thanks to Miller, Steve Winwood and other members of Traffic participated in the recording. Shortly after the recording and before the release, Ovenall voiced his concern over the movement away from their black musical roots i.e. blues, R, soul. In fact around 1965 The Farinas had publicity cards saying [...] "Farinas Soul and Roll". The single seemed to be going towards psychedelia, emphasised by the use of a phono fiddle borrowed from an Oxford Street busker, and played by Ric Grech. His concerns also included the role of management in the band. A meeting of the band was called, during which it was suggested that Ovenall's heart was no longer in the band and as a consequence he walked away from the band. Contrary to several reports he was not asked to leave the band. Family's debut single [...] "Scene Through The Eye of a Lens/Gypsy Woman", produced by Jimmy Miller and released by Liberty Records in October 1967, was not a success. Drummer Ovenall was replaced by Rob Townsend.|$|E
