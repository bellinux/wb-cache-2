The huge market demand increases the market revenue from 10. 6 billion dollars in 2005 to 25. 1 billion dollars in 2011 and {{it is expected to}} continue the growth. The increasing demand of data transmission and data storage forms tremendous gap between the flash capacity and application demand. In order to catch the market, flash memory device has been scaled down over 18 years. Highly reliable, fast reading, programming and <b>erasing</b> <b>speed,</b> and lower cost are always pursued. In 1998, the feature size of floating gate memory is 0. 7 um and right now it has been shrunk to 20 nm. There are fundamental issues that impede the further scaling down.

TiSi 2 nanocrystals were synthesized on SiO 2 by annealing Ti covered Si nanocrystals. Compared to the reference Si nanocrystal memory, both experiment and simulation results show that TiSi 2 nanocrystal memory exhibits larger memory window, faster writing and erasing, and longer retention lifetime {{as a result of the}} metallic property of the silicide nanocrystals. Due to thermally stable, CMOS compatible properties, TiSi 2 nanocrystals are highly promising for nonvolatile memory device application. Metal/high-k dielectric core-shell nanocrystal memory capacitors were proposed. This kind of MOS memory shows good performance in charge storage capacity, programming and <b>erasing</b> <b>speed.</b> A self-assembled di-block co-polymer is used to align the NCs to improve the scalability of the overall sample. An ordered Co/Al 2 O 3 core-shell nanocrystal (NC) nonvolatile memory device was also fabricated. Self-assembled di-block co-polymer process aligned the NCs with uniform size. Co/Al 2 O 3 core-shell NCs were formed using atomic layer deposition of Al 2 O 3 before and after the ordered Co NC formation. Compared to Co NC memory, Co/Al 2 O 3 core-shell NC memory shows improved retention performance without sacrificing writing and erasing speeds. Another new discrete NiSi nanocrystals (NCs) were synthesized by rapid thermal oxygen annealing (RTO) of very thin Si/Ni/Si films on SiO 2 tunneling layer. The RTO process resulted in smooth surface of the NC floating layer, in turn, uniform thickness of subsequent control oxide layer. Metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitor memory was fabricated. Electrical properties of the memory device such as programming, erasing and retention were characterized and good performance was achieved, which is due to the reduction of the leakage paths in the smooth device structure. Therefore, it is concluded that metallic nanocrystal with aligned core-shell structure memory is a very promising candidate to replace Si nanocrystal for future generation nonvolatile flash memory devices...|$|E

In particular, building ferroelectric memory with low power consumption and low operation voltage is critical for energy-saving and long-term operation of modern potable electronic devices. However, researchers face significant challenges, such as depolarization fields and charge trapping, which degrade the device performance, thereby preventing ferroelectric memory from realizing its potential [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. One-dimensional (1 D) nanostructures such as nanowires (NWs), nanotubes, and nanocables have attracted much attention over the past decades as conducting channels for FeFETs owing to their unique physical properties [6]. Many reports have suggested that nanowire ferroelectric {{field effect transistor}}s (NW FeFETs) have higher performance, that is, longer retention time, and better endurance memory characteristics compared with thin-film-based FeFET memory devices. For example, an NW with small dimensions is desirable for increasing the area density of devices, and a single-crystalline semiconductor NW can function as a superior carrier transport channel with enhanced field effect mobility (μ eff [...]), subthreshold slope (SS), and operation voltage [7, 8]. The superior mobility and small size of CNTs and semiconducting 2 -dimensional graphene ribbons have also been exploited to surpass the latest silicon (Si) technology in device operation speed [9, 10]. Despite great progress {{in the development of}} these materials, graphene FeFETs still suffer from a low ION/IOFF ratio and the OFF-state leakage problem owing to various undesirable tunneling mechanisms and ambipolar behavior. Furthermore, the difficulty in selecting metallic or semiconductor CNTs continues to limit the industrial applications of these materials.

40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{advances in}} structure and material optimization, poor <b>erase</b> (E) <b>speeds</b> and high retention charge loss remain the challenging issues for charge trap Flash (CTF) memories. In this paper, {{the dependence of}} SANOS memory performance and reliability on the composition of silicon nitride (SiN) layer is extensively studied. The effect of varying the Si:N ratio on program (P) /E and retention characteristics is investigated. SiN composition is shown to significantly alter the electron and hole trap properties. Varying the SiN composition from N-rich (N(+)) to Si-rich (Si(+)) lowers electron trap depth but increases hole trap depth, causing lower P state saturation but significant over-erase, resulting in an enhanced memory window. During retention, P state charge loss depends on thermal emission followed by the tunneling out of electrons mostly through tunnel dielectric, which becomes worse for Si(+) SiN. Erase state charge loss mainly depends on hole redistribution {{under the influence of}} internal electric fields, which improves with Si(+) SiN.

40|$|Metal-Oxide-Silicon Field-Effect-Transistors with a {{layer of}} {{electrically}} isolated Si nanocrystals (NCs) embedded in the gate oxide are known to improve conventional floating gate flash memories. Data retention, program and <b>erase</b> <b>speeds</b> as well as the memory operation voltages can be substantially improved due to the discrete charge storage in the isolated Si NCs. Using ion beam synthesis, Si NCs can be fabricated along with standard CMOS processing. The optimization of the location and size of ion beam synthesized Si NCs requires {{a deeper understanding of the}} mechanisms involved, which determine (i) the built-up of Si supersaturation by high-fluence ion implantation and (ii) NC formation by phase separation. For that aim, process simulations have been conducted that address both aspects on a fundamental level and, on the other hand, are able to avoid tedious experiments. The built-up of a Si supersaturation by high-fluence ion implantation were studied using dynamic binary collision calculations with TRIDYN and have lead to a prediction of Si excess depth profiles in thin gate oxides of a remarkable quality. These simulations include in a natural manner high fluence implantation effects as target erosion by sputtering, target swelling and ion beam mixing. The second stage of ion beam synthesis is modeled with the help of a tailored kinetic Monte Carlo code that combines a detailed kinetic description of phase separation on atomic level with the required degree of abstraction that is necessary to span the timescales involved. Large ensembles of Si NCs were simulated reaching the late stages of NC formation and dissolution at simulation sizes that allowed a direct comparison with experimental studies, e. g. with electron energy loss resolved TEM investigations. These comparisons reveal a nice degree of agreement, e. g. in terms of predicted and observed precipitate morphologies for different ion fluences. However, they also point clearly onto impact of additional external influences as, e. g., the oxidation of implanted Si by absorbed humidity, which was identified with the help of these process simulations. Moreover, these simulations are utilized as a general tool to identify optimum processing regimes for a tailored Si NC formation for NC memories. It is shown that key properties for NC memories as the tunneling distance from the transistor channel to the Si NCs, the NC morphology, size and density can be adjusted accurately despite of the involved degree of self-organization. Furthermore, possible lateral electron tunneling between neighboring Si NCs is evaluated on the basis of the performed kinetic Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R

It has been demonstrated that BE-SONOS memories exhibit a good performance in terms of programming and <b>erasing</b> (P/E) <b>speed</b> and data retention.

40|$|Discrete charge-trapping {{flash memory}} is being {{developed}} for the next-generation commercial flash-memory applications due to its advantages over the traditional floating-gate counterpart. Currently, Si 3 N 4 is widely used as charge-trapping layer (CTL). However, Si 3 N 4 has low dielectric constant and small conduction-band offset {{with respect to the}} SiO 2 tunneling layer, imposing limitation on further applications. Therefore, this research emphasized on investigating new dielectrics with appropriate fabrication methods to replace Si 3 N 4 as CTL for achieving improved memory performance. Firstly, GeON CTL annealed at different temperatures was investigated. The memory device with post-deposition annealing at 600 0 C exhibited the largest memory window, the best charge retention performance, and the highest reliability. These good results are {{due to the fact that}} optimal annealing temperature could suppress shallow traps and also produce new traps with desirable energy levels in the CTL. Since ZnON has a negative conduction-band offset (NCBO) with respect to Si, the traps located in the bandgap of ZnON should have deep energy levels. The memory performances of ZrON film with and without Zn doping were studied. Experimental results showed that ZrZnON film had higher program speed and better charge retention performance due to many deeper trap levels induced by the Zn doping, as well as higher <b>erase</b> <b>speed</b> due to the direct recombination of electrons at these deeper trap levels with incoming holes and the intermediary role of these deeper trap levels under erase mode. MoO 3 is another NCBO dielectric with a high K value and many oxygen vacancies. La 2 O 3, a rare-earth metal oxide, is a promising dielectric as CTL. To combine the advantages of both La 2 O 3 and MoO 3, Mo-doped La 2 O 3 was proposed as a new CTL. Compared to the device with pure La 2 O 3, the one with LaMoO film as CTL had significantly larger C-V hysteresis window, much higher P/E speeds, and better charge retention due to the deeper-level traps and deeper quantum wells created by the LaMoO film. Nitrogen incorporation is a popular approach to increase the trap density in the bulk of CTL. In this research, the memory performances of GdTiO films with and without nitrogen incorporation were compared. Since the nitrogen incorporation induced smaller equivalent oxide thickness, produced nitride-related traps with desirable energy level and larger cross-section for charge capture, the GdTiON film possessed better memory performance than the GdTiO film. Finally, fluorine plasma was employed to improve the quality of blocking layer. The memory device with AlOF blocking layer obtained higher program speed, better reliability and better charge retention than that based on AlO blocking layer. The improved performance was due to the fact that the fluorine incorporation passivated the defects and removed the excess oxygen in the bulk of the blocking layer. In summary, dielectric plays important roles in the performance of charge-trapping flash memory. Memory devices with GeON, ZrZnON, LaMoO, or GdTiON as charge trapping layer and AlOF as blocking layer can produce large memory window, high program/erase speed and good charge retention. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Tunnel oxide {{thickness}} scaling is encountering {{problem for}} next generation flash memory device. With tunnel oxide shrinking down, the stress-induced leakage current becomes more serious leading to degraded retention. To overcome this, flash memory with discrete-traps as floating gate was proposed, including nitride charging and nanocrystal storage. The first report on nanocrystal memory is Si nanocrystal memory. After that, tremendous {{efforts have been}} put on using semiconductor or metal nanocrystals for memory application. However, for Si, although long retention time has been demonstrated, the long retention is believed to be related to charge storage on defect levels. Those levels are distributed throughout the whole band gap of Si and are not thermally stable, resulting in compromised device reliability. For metals, on the other hand, the band gap is negligible, therefore the issue of defect level charging is effectively avoided. However, the problem with metal nanocrystal memory lies in the reaction or inter-diffusion between metal and tunnel oxide underneath at high-temperature process step, such as source/drain dopant activation annealing for MOSFET. The reaction or diffusion of metal atoms generates weak points in the tunnel oxide, which degrades the device retention. To solve the dilemma between long retention and scaled tunnel oxide, in this work, engineered floating gate, such as hybrid-nanocrystal and new materials nanocrystals that are compatible with current Si technology, was proposed and good memory performance was demonstrated. Chapter 1 introduces the conventional flash memory, including the operation principle, architectures, challenge in next generation flash memory and some new technologies to address this issue in conventional flash. Chapter 2 describes the methodologies used in this thesis work, including nanocrystal growth methods, nanocrystal characterization techniques, and nanocrystal memory fabrication and device characterization. Chapter 3 discusses the flash memory with Ge/Si hetero-nanocrystals as floating gate. Type-II band alignment between Ge and Si makes Ge/Si hetero-nanocrystal good for long time hole storage than Si nanocrystal memory. In addition to p-MOS, we also developed n-MOS memory with CoSi 2 -coated Si nanocrystals as floating gate in the Chapter 4. The Fermi-level of CoSi 2 locates around the midgap of Si so that the device is good for both electrons and holes trapping. Furthermore, the quantum well formed between CoSi 2 and SiO 2 is deeper than that of Si and SiO 2, leading to an elongated retention time. The Si nanocrystal underneath the CoSi 2 effectively prevents the charges stored in CoSi 2 from leaking back to the channel. In order to lower the thermal budget to make silicide nanocrystals, vapor-solid-solid (VSS) growth mode was employed and NiSi 2 nanocrystsals were synthesized as presented in Chapter 5. The long retention of NiSi 2 nanocrystal memory is also benefited from the deep quantum well between NiSi 2 and SiO 2. For next generation flash memory, more uniform nanocrystals with higher dot density, 1012 cm- 2, is necessary to meet the requirement of 22 nm technology and beyond. In Chapter 6, we developed PtSi nanocrystals using the similar synthesis technique as NiSi 2. The nanocrystal density is enhanced from 3 × 1011 cm- 2 to 1. 5 × 1012 cm- 2. In short, engineering the nano-floating gate by replacing Si nanocrystals with hybrid nanocrystals and silicide nanocrystals benefits the device retention time. These new memories also exhibit faster programming and <b>erasing</b> <b>speeds.</b> The enhanced memory performance makes the devices fit for next generation memory with further scaled tunnel oxide...|$|R
