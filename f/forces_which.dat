The entire UNSC fleet at Onyx is destroyed by the ensuing battle, save for one stealth ship, the Dusk, which stays hidden, observing the events.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1930s, Barrowclough was {{disenchanted with}} the state of New Zealand's {{military}} <b>forces,</b> <b>which</b> was in decline {{due to a lack of}} resources and the discontinuation of compulsory military training. In 1936, he encouraged the reformation of the National Defence League of New Zealand (NDL), a defence lobby group which aimed to encourage and revitalise New Zealand's defence preparations for war. The country's defence arrangements were in a poor state of affairs at the time but the NDL gained little traction with the Labour Government.|$|E

50|$|Equilibrant {{force is}} a <b>force</b> <b>which</b> brings {{equilibrium}} state. It {{is considered to}} be the equal and opposite of the resultant force. Equilibrant force is the <b>force,</b> <b>which</b> keeps any object motionless and acts on virtually every object in the world that is not moving. This term was first used in the 1800s to indicate counterbalancing a force system.|$|R
5|$|In 1913 the Admiralty {{agreed to}} lend Philomel to New Zealand as a {{seagoing}} training cruiser {{to form the}} nucleus of the newly established New Zealand Naval <b>Forces,</b> <b>which</b> was a new division of the Royal Navy. This was in response to the desire of the New Zealand Minister of Defence at the time, James Allen, who wanted to establish a local naval force which would co-operate with the fledgling Royal Australian Navy.|$|E
5|$|In {{his pursuit}} of a {{unification}} of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear <b>forces,</b> <b>which</b> were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.|$|E
5|$|Individually, {{each game}} in the series has been {{generally}} well received. In 1995, Dark Forces became LucasArts' highest sell-in with more than 300,000 copies accounted for at launch. Games in the series have achieved consistently favorable review scores from most publications, and hold high aggregate scores on both Metacritic and GameRankings. The only exceptions are the PlayStation version of Dark <b>Forces,</b> <b>which</b> was perceived to have graphical problems and the GameCube version of Jedi Outcast, which was seen as considerably inferior to the PC and Xbox versions.|$|E

Nor could Stephen decisively defeat Matilda's <b>forces,</b> <b>which</b> meant that England remained divided in allegiance between the two rivals. But while Matilda was in England, her husband Geoffrey was conquering Normandy, which he finally overran in 1144.|$|E
5|$|Murray made steady {{progress}} against the Turkish <b>forces,</b> <b>which</b> were {{defeated in the}} battles of Romani, Magdhaba and Rafa. However, he was repulsed at {{the first and second}} battle of Gaza in 1917. The defeat in the Second Battle of Gaza prompted the War Office to change the command of the EEF, and on 28 June 1917, Murray was replaced by General Sir Edmund Allenby, who reinvigorated the campaign.|$|E

5|$|Pernick and Wilder {{highlight}} eight major {{clean technology}} sectors: solar power, wind power, biofuels, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications, and water filtration. Six major <b>forces,</b> <b>which</b> {{they call the}} six C’s, are pushing clean technology into the mainstream: costs, capital, competition, China, consumers, and climate. Very large corporations such as GE, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are making multibillion-dollar investments in clean technology.|$|E
5|$|Philip's {{campaign}} in Greece became linked with a new, fourth, Sacred War. The citizens of Amphissa in Ozolian Locris had begun cultivating land sacred to Apollo on the Crisaean plain south of Delphi; after some internal bickering the Amphictyonic council decided {{to declare a}} sacred war against Amphissa. A Thessalian delegate proposed that Philip should be made leader of the Amphictyonic <b>forces,</b> <b>which</b> therefore gave Philip a pretext to {{campaign in}} Greece; it is, however, probable that Philip would have gone ahead with his campaign anyway.|$|E
