Our findings suggest that methods integrating HMMs with current holistic acoustic measures of speech may be a useful tool in accounting for acoustic change due to speaker interaction...|$|R

They view the cardiorenal syndrome in a more <b>holistic,</b> integrative <b>manner.</b> They defined the cardiorenal syndrome as a pathophysiological condition in which combined heart and kidney dysfunction amplifies progression of failure of the individual organ, by inducing similar pathophysiological mechanisms. Therefore, regardless of which organ fails first, the same neurohormonal systems are activated causing accelerated cardiovascular disease, and progression of damage and failure of both organs. These systems are broken down into two broad categories of [...] "hemodynamic factors" [...] and non-hemodynamic factors or [...] "cardiorenal connectors".|$|R

40|$|Gait {{recognition}} algorithms {{are being}} increasingly widely researched, however a common {{assumption is that}} the subject will be presented side on to the camera. In practice {{it may not be}} possible to capture data from this view, so a useful gait recognition algorithm will have to provide a measure of orientation independence. Three gait recognition algorithms are examined and found to perform poorly with nonnormal orientation. The complex detail used for recognition can not be translated between orientations in a <b>holistic</b> silhouette <b>manner.</b> It is shown that orientation independent features can be extracted using a human model. The algorithm is developed and tested on live captured data and found to perform better across orientations than silhouette based approaches. The performance recorded at a single orientation is lower than that of other approaches, however only the motion of the subject is currently used for recognition. More accurate motion estimation will increase performance as will the inclusion of other model based features. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} number of {{connections}} between administratively controllable causes of fatigue and problems associated with police performance, health, and safety – problems that have long been overlooked. The effects of fatigue on human behavior, performance, and physiology are well understood, and widely known. Excess fatigue arising from sleep loss, circadian disruption, and other factors tends to decrease alertness, impair performance, and worsen mood. It therefore {{may be expected to}} influence the performance, health, and safety of patrol officers. The argument is made that much of the fatigue experienced by patrol officers could be controlled administratively, just as we control the working hours of many other occupational groups. As was emphasized in a recent special issue of Human Factors devoted to fatigue, it is important to approach fatigue-related research in a <b>holistic,</b> interdisciplinary <b>manner</b> (Mital and Kumar, 1994 : 195 - 6).
