Around the world, several regions are subjected to a decline of fertility due to an increasing degradation of soils, loss of organic matter and increasing desertification. Recently research was carried out to evaluate, in the same pedological and climatic conditions, the impact of three long-term (14 years) agricultural systems, continuous giant reed, natural grassland, and cropping sequence, on the organic-matter characteristics and microbial biomass size in soil. The study pointed out that a long term Giant reed cropping system, characterized by low tillage intensity, positively affect the amount and quality of soil organic matter. Arundo donax showed greater values than tilled management system for total soil organic carbon, light fraction carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon. Regarding the <b>humification</b> parameters, there were noticed any statistically differences between giant reed and a cropping sequence (cereals-legumes cultivated conventionally).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Peat <b>humification</b> {{analysis}} {{is a widely}} used palaeoclimate proxy. However, recent studies combining <b>humification</b> with other proxies of mire surface wetness have identified inconsistencies between the records. We illustrate this inconsistency by comparing <b>humification</b> records with plant macrofossil profiles in three ombrotrophic bogs. Peat <b>humification</b> is a measure for organic decay and reflects changing palaeohydrological conditions and former vegetation composition. The resulting signal {{is considered to be}} a derived response to climate. However, even minor changes in the botanical composition of the peat may have a significant influence on <b>humification</b> measurements. The implications of this for palaeoclimate studies are discussed. The assumption that climate has been the major influence on variations in <b>humification</b> rests on the botanical composition being relatively homogeneous throughout the peat profile, and is therefore questionable. Consideration should be given to developing species-specific measures of <b>humification</b> and to testing the assumption that the major influence on peat <b>humification</b> is the surface wetness of the bog (and therefore climate) ...|$|E

30|$|The {{spectroscopy}} {{technique is}} widely used for determining the maturity in vermicompost material. Gieguzynska et al. (1998) and Sellami et al. (2008) suggested three important regions where exact absorbance could be measured in the UV-vis spectra: (1) the absorption at 280  nm indicates {{the beginning of the}} transformation of lignin and aliphatic compounds, (2) the absorption at 472  nm indicates the beginning of organic macromolecules depolymerisation and <b>humification,</b> and (3) the absorption at 664  nm is an indication of a highly humified material {{with a high degree of}} aromatic compounds and oxygen content in the stabilization phase. Ravindran et al. (2013) performed UV-vis spectroscopy analysis to assess the degree of <b>humification</b> during vermicomposting of fermented animal fleshing waste. The absorbance ratios (Q 2 / 6, Q 4 / 6 and Q 2 / 4) in all treatments decreased and reached minimum at the end. The <b>humification</b> index decreased in treated mixtures with earthworms compared to that in the treated mixtures without earthworm. Low <b>humification</b> index in the final vermicompost indicates a high level of organic material <b>humification.</b> Lim and Wu (2015) studied UV-vis spectroscopy analysis to determine the degree of <b>humification</b> during vermicomposting of palm oil industry effluent. The UV-vis spectra of the final vermicompost showed wider shoulder as compared to initial waste mixtures, reflecting the maturity of the final vermicompost. The results indicated that both the <b>humification</b> index ratios (Q 2 / 6, Q 2 / 4) were lower in the final vermicompost as compared to initial wastes. The decreases in <b>humification</b> index ratios (Q 2 / 6, Q 2 / 4) indicates decomposition and degradation of organic compounds by earthworms. Hussain et al. (2016 b) studied UV-vis spectroscopy analysis to assess the degree of <b>humification</b> during vermicomposting of toxic parthenium weed. The results reveal that the <b>humification</b> index (Q 4 / 6) values of initial parthenium weed (7.29) were reduced (1.89) after vermicomposting. The reduction in the <b>humification</b> index of final vermicomposted parthenium weed indicates weed’s transformation into a strongly humified and matured material. Hussain et al. (2016 c) also confirmed the high level of <b>humification</b> during the vermicomposting of toxic and allelopathic ipomoea weed. The findings indicated that the <b>humification</b> index (Q 4 / 6) values of toxic weed reduced from 7.74 to 1.90 in the final vermicompost. The fall of <b>humification</b> index achieved after vermicomposting of ipomoea weed indicates high level of <b>humification</b> by earthworms. The earthworm along with microorganisms accelerates the decomposition and stabilization of organic material and turns it into stable humus.|$|E

Base leaching and acidification of decarbonated Rendzinas led to a decrease in <b>humification</b> degree of humic acids. In calcareous Rendzinas, the <b>humification</b> degree of humic acids was in descending order: grassland>arable land>forest land, and in decarbonated Rendzinas: arable land>grassland>forest land. The <b>humification</b> degree of humic acids was higher in the calcareous forest and grassland Rendzinas compared to decarbonated Rendzinas, analogously in decarbonated arable land compared to calcareous arable land Rendzinas.

Their potential in western North America remains largely unexploited despite an abundance of candidate sites. Peat <b>humification</b> analysis is a widely used technique for palaeoclimatic inference from peatlands. This study attempts to demonstrate a climatic role in determining peat <b>humification</b> by comparing low-resolution peat <b>humification</b> records from five mires in south-east Alaska. <b>Humification</b> was determined by alkali extraction and colorimetry and records dated by radiocarbon and tephrochronology. Testate amoebae analysis was carried out across a major humification-inferred wet shift in three of the sites. The <b>humification</b> results show variability {{down the length of the}} cores but there is only limited agreement between records from different sites. Many general trends in the data appear to be out of phase and periods of proxy 'complacency' are shown. This study does not provide strong evidence for climatic forcing of <b>humification</b> in these sites. Methodological issues including possible problems with the age-depth models and the role of a peat-forming plant species signal in the <b>humification</b> data are discussed.

30|$|The <b>humification</b> {{degree and}} {{characteristics}} of SOM could be evaluated by ratio of alkyl-C/O-alkyl-C and aromaticity. The high ratio of alkyl-C/O-alkyl-C and aromaticity indicates the high <b>humification</b> degree of SOM in the soils (Baldock et al. 1997; Almendros et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2004; Mueller and Koegel-Knabner 2009). The alkyl-C/O-alkyl-C ratios of the Oi, Oe, and Oa horizons in the 3 positions increased with increasing soil depth (Table  3), which indicates a higher <b>humification</b> degree in the Oa horizon. We found no typical pattern for alkyl-C/O-alkyl-C ratios in O horizons along topographical positions (Table  3), which indicates restrained decomposition and <b>humification</b> because of low temperature and high annual precipitation. The results for aromaticity {{were similar to those}} for alkyl-C/O-alkyl-C (Table  3), which could reflect the <b>humification</b> state of SOM. The influence of litter input on changes in remnant masses of each carbon during the early <b>humification</b> processes showed that mass loss rate of aromatic C in humified litter is higher in cypress than cedar (Ono et al. 20092011). Our previous studies showed that <b>humification</b> degree of HAs, determined by E 4 /E 6 ratio (Chen et al. 2001 a, b) and by 13 C NMR (Chung et al. 2012) differed little by topographic position of the study site.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) {{is derived from}} dead biomass of animals and plants, and its {{formation}} {{process in which the}} precursor materials of SOM are transformed into macro organic molecules through geo-chemical and geo-biological reactions in the subsurface environment is referred to as <b>humification.</b> Carbon content increases, but oxygen content decreases along with marked increased in molecular weight and degree of condensation of SOM during <b>humification.</b> It has been known that humus materials evolve in the order of biopolymer, fulvic acid, humic acid, and humin. <b>Humification</b> process takes place in a geological time scale, but it can be accelerated at extremely high temperatures, which can be achieved by microwave (MW) with hyperthermal catalysts (HTCs). Thus, MW was irradiated to the mixture of soil and HTCs to stimulate <b>humification</b> of SOM and to enhance its binding capacity for recalcitrant organic contaminants in this study.

40|$|The {{polyphenol}} pathway and Maillard reaction (polycondensation of sugars and amino acids) {{are regarded}} as important pathways in natural <b>humification.</b> The significance of linking the Maillard reaction and polyphenol pathways into an integrated <b>humification</b> pathway has been addressed. However, the ability of mineral colloids commonly occurring in tropical and temperate environments to promote the Maillard reaction and integrated polyphenol-Maillard <b>humification</b> pathways remained to be uncovered. Furthermore, {{the effect of the}} nature and relative abundance of biomolecules on <b>humification</b> and associated reaction products remained to be studied. The results of this study show that the structure of polyphenols and the relative molar ratio of polyphenol, glucose and glycine, significantly affected <b>humification</b> processes and the associated carbonate formation in the integrated polyphenol-Maillard reaction catalyzed by birnessite. Increasing the molar ratio of ortho-polyphenols (catechol and pyrogallol) to Maillard reagents in the polyphenol-Maillard pathway catalyzed by birnessite enhanced <b>humification</b> while suppressing the formation of rhodochrosite (MnCO 3). The opposite trend of MnCO 3 formation was observed in the meta-polyphenol (resorcinol) -Maillard reaction system. Increasing the amount of glucose in the integrated catechol-Maillard system under the catalysis of birnessite promoted the formation of Maillard reaction-type humic acid in the supernatant and MnCO 3 in the solid phase. The catalytic abilities of commonly occurring mineral colloids from temperate and tropical regions greatly differed in influencing <b>humification</b> processes and products in the Maillard reaction and integrated polyphenol-Maillard pathways. Compared with layer silicate colloids, the poorly ordered Fe and Mn oxides were by far the strongest catalysts of <b>humification</b> reactions in the Maillard and catechol-Maillard pathways. This accounted for the significant difference in reactivity between the sesquioxide-rich Oxisol clay from the high rainfall region of South Africa and the Mollisol clay from the Canadian Prairies. Furthermore, the nature of the mineral colloids also affected the extent of organic C accumulation in the solid phase upon <b>humification,</b> and related mineral surface alteration. The metal oxide- and Oxisol clay-catalyzed Maillard and catechol-Maillard reaction systems had the highest accumulation of organic C in the solid phase, indicating their significance in contributing to C sequestration in the environment. The findings obtained in this study are of fundamental significance in understanding the influence of the atomic bonding, structural configuration and related surface properties of mineral colloids, and the nature and abundance of biomolecules on the abiotic <b>humification</b> pathways and related reaction products in natural environments...|$|E
