50|$|In a {{commercial}} income-producing property this approach capitalizes an income stream into a value indication. This {{can be done}} using revenue multipliers or capitalization rates applied to a Net Operating Income (NOI). Usually, an NOI has been stabilized {{so as not to}} place too much weight on a very recent event. An example of this is an unleased building which, technically, has no NOI. A stabilized NOI would assume that the building is leased at a normal rate, and to usual occupancy levels. The Net Operating Income (NOI) is gross potential income (GPI), less vacancy and collection loss (= Effective <b>Gross</b> Income) less <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> (but excluding debt service, income taxes, and/or depreciation charges applied by accountants).|$|R

Descriptive statistics, Cost and return analysis, Herfindahl index, <b>Gross</b> ratio, <b>Operating</b> ratio, <b>Expense</b> structure ratio, Return per capital invested, Benefit cost ratio were used to analyze the data. The study showed that majority (64 %) of the plantain marketers were male. 65. 3 % are within the active age range of 31 - 60 years. Most respondents are married and educated having a household size of between 1 - 10 members. Herfindahl index of 0. 03 revealed that plantain market tends towards perfect competition. The costs and return analysis showed that purchased cost, transportation, labour and storage cost constitute the variable cost and rent, tools and market charges forms the fixed cost. Furthermore, the finding showed that plantain marketing is profitable with the net return of 14, 369 naira per month from the sales of 163 plantains bunches.

5000|$|In his analysis, Berry {{determined}} that the best method for determining an arm's length result was to compare the Swiss distributor's markup on <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> to the same markup earned by uncontrolled (i.e., third-party) distributors performing substantially similar functions. Berry's key insight in the case was that distributors should earn a return proportionate to the distribution services performed. The value of the products being distributed, in other words, was irrelevant. Accordingly, distributors must achieve a particular gross profit in order to compensate them for their value-adding services, the costs of which are accounted for, almost entirely, in their <b>operating</b> <b>expenses.</b> The IRS defines the ratio now, awkwardly, as the [...] "Ratio of <b>Gross</b> Profits to <b>Operating</b> Costs".|$|R

Their findings show that undistributed <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> are related to the extent of the property’s business and product-services mix.

In fiscal year 2003, USAID estimates that it will obligate about $ 13 billion for assistance programs in almost 160 countries. In recent years, demands on USAID's budget and workforce have increased as the agency strives to meet emerging requirements, such as reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq and increased funding for health programs. However, USAID officials have expressed concern that funds provided for its administrative or <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> have not kept pace with the agency's requirements. Since 1976, Congress has included a separate appropriation to consolidate USAID's <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> into a single budget item. Congress intended that USAID pay for the administrative costs of delivering foreign assistance (its "cost of doing business") from an <b>operating</b> <b>expense</b> account separate from its humanitarian and development assistance program funds. These <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> are costs incurred primarily {{for the benefit of the}} United States rather than the foreign assistance recipient. In accordance with congressional guidance, USAID reports all expenses related to the U.

Other <b>operating</b> <b>expenses</b> such as depreciation charges (D) trigger no payment, meaning that they have no impact on cash. 9 These book entries are purely accounting charges.
