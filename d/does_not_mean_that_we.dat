5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely {{as a means to}} an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can never treat a human as a means to an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions {{is that if}} we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, this <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E

[...] He also made an off-the-cuff, unserious remark on the Straight Talk Express that referred to Robertson and Falwell as [...] "forces of evil", that came across as angry hostility to many Christian conservatives.

500|$|McCain's {{campaign}} {{never completely}} recovered from his South Carolina defeat, {{although he did}} rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan a few days later. He made a speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders, including Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, as divisive conservatives, declaring [...] "...we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community. But that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> will pander to their self-appointed leaders." [...] McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29, and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush. With little hope of overcoming Bush's delegate lead, McCain withdrew from the race on March 9, 2000. He endorsed Bush two months later, and made occasional appearances with the Texas governor during the general election campaign.|$|E

Ezekiel said that McCaughey's euthanasia claims were a [...] "willful distortion of my record". Jim Rutennberg said that Emanuel's critics oversimplified complex issues, such as who should get a kidney. Such rationing {{was said to be}} unavoidable because of scarcity, and because a scarce resource such as a liver is [...] "indivisible". Emanuel said that McCaughey took words out of context, omitting qualifiers such as [...] "Without overstating it (and without fully defending it) ... Clearly, {{more needs to be done}} ..." [...] Emanuel once compared the word [...] "rationing" [...] to George Carlin’s seven words you can't say on television.

60|$|I am {{inclined}} to think--but here I speak beyond {{the text of}} contemporary Socialist literature--that in certain directions Socialism, while destroying property, will introduce a compensatory element by creating rights. For example, Socialism will certainly destroy all private property in land and in natural material and accumulated industrial resources; {{it will be the}} universal landlord and the universal capitalist, but that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall all be the State's tenants-at-will. There {{can be little doubt that}} the Socialist State will recognize the rights of the improving occupier and the beneficial hirer. It is manifestly in accordance both with justice and public policy that a man who takes a piece of land and creates a value on it--by making a vineyard, let us say--is entitled to security of tenure, is to be dispossessed only in exceptional circumstances and with ample atonement. If a man who takes an agricultural or horticultural holding comes to feel that there he will toil and there later he will rest upon his labours, I do not think a rational Socialism will war against this passion for the vine and fig-tree. If it absolutely refuses the idea of freehold, it will certainly not repudiate leasehold. I think the State may prove a far more generous and sentimental landlord in many things than any private person.|$|E
60|$|And {{the same}} antithesis exists about another modern {{religion}}--I mean {{the religion of}} Comte, generally known as Positivism, or the worship of humanity. Such men as Mr. Frederic Harrison, that brilliant and chivalrous philosopher, who still, by his mere personality, speaks for the creed, would tell us that he offers us the philosophy of Comte, but not all Comte's fantastic proposals for pontiffs and ceremonials, the new calendar, the new holidays and saints' days. He <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should dress ourselves up as priests of humanity or let off fireworks because it is Milton's birthday. To the solid English Comtist all this appears, he confesses, {{to be a little}} absurd. To me it appears the only sensible part of Comtism. As a philosophy it is unsatisfactory. It is evidently impossible to worship humanity, just as it is impossible to worship the Savile Club; both are excellent institutions to which we may happen to belong. But we perceive clearly that the Savile Club did not make the stars and does not fill the universe. And it is surely unreasonable to attack the doctrine of the Trinity as a piece of bewildering mysticism, and then to ask men to worship a being who is ninety million persons in one God, neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance.|$|E

60|$|We have {{to follow}} our reason as our sole guide in our {{individual}} treatment of all such things as food and health and sex. God is {{the king of the}} whole world, he is the owner of our souls and bodies and all things. He is not particularly concerned about any aspect, because he is concerned about every aspect. We have to make the best use of ourselves for his kingdom; that is our rule of life. That rule means neither painful nor frantic abstinences nor any forced way of living. Purity, cleanliness, health, none of these things are for themselves, they are for use; none are magic, all are means. The sword must be sharp and clean. That <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are perpetually to sharpen and clean it--which would weaken and waste the blade. The sword must neither be drawn constantly nor always rusting in its sheath. Those who have had the wits and soul to come to God, will have the wits and soul to find out and know what is waste, what is vanity, what is the happiness that begets strength of body and spirit, what is error, where vice begins, and to avoid and repent and recoil from all those things that degrade. These are matters not of the rule of life but of the application of life. They must neither be neglected nor made disproportionally important.|$|E
6000|$|In such living Russian {{writers as}} I have read, in Kuprin, Gorky, and others, I still see and welcome this {{peculiar}} quality of rendering life through--but not veiled by--the author's temperament; {{so that the}} effect is almost as if no ink were used. When one says that the Russian novel has already profoundly modified our literature, one <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have now nearly triumphed over the need for ink, or that our temperaments have become Russian; but {{that some of us}} have become infected with the wish to see and record the truth and obliterate that competitive moralising which from time immemorial has been the characteristic bane of English art. In other words, the Russian passion for understanding has tempered a little the English passion for winning. What we admire and look for in Russian literature is its truth and its profound and comprehending tolerance. I am credibly informed that what Russians admire and look for in our literature is its quality of [...] "no nonsense" [...] and its assertive vigour. In a word, they are attracted by that in it which is new to them. I venture to hope that they will not become infected by us in this matter; that nothing will dim in their writers spiritual and intellectual honesty of vision or tinge them with self-consciousness. It is still for us to borrow from Russian literary art, and learn, if we can, to sink ourselves in life and reproduce it without obtrusion of our points of view, except in that subtle way which gives to each creative work its essential individuality. Our boisterousness in art is too self-conscious to be real, and our restraint is only a superficial legacy from Puritanism.|$|E
6000|$|Now, my dear Adelaide, dismiss {{from your}} mind the least idea of fault upon your side; nothing is {{further from the}} fact. I cannot forgive you, for I do not know your fault. My own is plain enough, {{and the name of}} it is cold-hearted neglect; and you may busy {{yourself}} more usefully in trying to forgive me. But ugly as my fault is, you must not suppose it to mean more than it does; it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have at all forgotten you, that we have become at all indifferent to the thought of you. See, in my life of Jenkin, a remark of his, very well expressed, on the friendships of men who do not write to each other. I can honestly say that I have not changed to you in any way; though I have behaved thus ill, thus cruelly. Evil is done by want of - well, principally by want of industry. You can imagine what I would say (in a novel) of any one who had behaved as I have done, DETERIORA SEQUOR. And you must somehow manage to forgive your old friend; and if you will be so very good, continue to give us news of you, and let us share the knowledge of your adventures, sure that it will be always followed with interest - even if it is answered with the silence of ingratitude. For I am not a fool; I know my faults, I know they are ineluctable, I know they are growing on me. I know I may offend again, and I warn you of it. But the next time I offend, tell me so plainly and frankly like a lady, and don't lacerate my heart and bludgeon my vanity with imaginary faults of your own and purely gratuitous penitence. I might suspect you of irony! ...|$|E

60|$|They are children--that is, {{ignorant and}} unable {{to take care of}} themselves; because they do not know what they are. St. Paul tells us what they are. That they are all God's offspring, though they know it not. He likens them to young children, who, though they are their father's heirs, have no more liberty than slaves have; but are kept under tutors and masters, till they have arrived at years of discretion, and are fit to take their places as their father's sons, and {{to go out into the}} world, and have the {{management}} of their own affairs, and a share in their father's property, which they may use for themselves, instead of being merely fed and clothed by, and kept in subjection to him, whether they will or not. This is what he means by receiving the adoption of sons. He <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are not God's children till we find out that we are God's children. That is what some people say; but that is the very exact contrary to what St. Paul used to say. He told the heathen Athenians that they were God's children. He put them in mind that one of their own heathen poets had told them so, and had said, 'We are also God's offspring.' And so in this chapter he says, You were God's children all along, though you did not know it. You were God's heirs all along, although you differed nothing from slaves; for as long as you were in your heathen ignorance and foolishness, God had to treat you as His slaves, not as His children; and so you were in bondage under the elements of the world, till the fulness of time was come.|$|E
60|$|This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> should {{throw away}} legend and parable and drama: {{they are the}} natural {{vehicles}} of dogma; but woe to the Churches and rulers who substitute the legend for the dogma, the parable for the history, the drama for the religion! Better by far declare the throne of God empty than set a liar and a fool on it. What are called wars of religion are always wars to destroy religion by affirming the historical truth or material substantiality of some legend, and killing those who refuse to accept it as historical or substantial. But who has ever refused to accept a good legend with delight as a legend? The legends, the parables, the dramas, are among the choicest treasures of mankind. No one is ever tired of stories of miracles. In vain did Mahomet repudiate the miracles ascribed to him: in vain did Christ furiously scold those who asked him {{to give them an}} exhibition as a conjurer: in vain did the saints declare that God chose them not for their powers but for their weaknesses; that the humble might be exalted, and the proud rebuked. People will have their miracles, their stories, their heroes and heroines and saints and martyrs and divinities to exercise their gifts of affection, admiration, wonder, and worship, and their Judases and devils to enable them to be angry and yet feel that they do well to be angry. Every one of these legends is the common heritage of the human race; and there is only one inexorable condition attached to their healthy enjoyment, which is that no one shall believe them literally. The reading of stories and delighting in them made Don Quixote a gentleman: the believing them literally made him a madman who slew lambs instead of feeding them. In England today good books of Eastern religious legends are read eagerly; and Protestants and Atheists read Roman Catholic legends of the Saints with pleasure. But such fare is shirked by Indians and Roman Catholics. Freethinkers read the Bible: indeed they seem to be its only readers now except the reluctant parsons at the church lecterns, who communicate their discomfort to the congregation by gargling the words in their throats in an unnatural manner that is as repulsive as it is unintelligible. And this is because the imposition of the legends as literal truths at once changes them from parables into falsehoods. The feeling against the Bible has become so strong at last that educated people not only refuse to outrage their intellectual consciences by reading the legend of Noah's Ark, with its funny beginning about the animals and its exquisite end about the birds: they will not read even the chronicles of King David, which may very well be true, and are certainly more candid than the official biographies of our contemporary monarchs.|$|E
