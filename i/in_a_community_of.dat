5|$|Elie Wiesel {{was born}} on 30 September 1928 in Sighet, a town in the Carpathian {{mountains}} of northern Transylvania, to Chlomo Wiesel, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah, née Feig. The family lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> 10,000–20,000 mostly Orthodox Jews. Northern Transylvania had been annexed by Hungary in 1940, and restrictions on Jews were already in place, but the period Wiesel discusses {{at the beginning of}} the book, 1941–1943, was a relatively calm one for the Jewish population.|$|E
5|$|The {{fortunes}} of the Moreton family declined during the English Civil War. As supporters of the Royalist cause, they found themselves isolated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> Parliamentarians. Little Moreton Hall was requisitioned by the Parliamentarians in 1643 and used to billet Parliamentary soldiers. The family successfully petitioned for its restitution, and survived the Civil War with their ownership of Little Moreton Hall intact, but financially they were crippled. They tried to sell the entire estate, but could only dispose of several parcels of land. William Moreton died in 1654 leaving debts of £3,000–£4,000 (equivalent to about £12–16 million as of 2010), which forced his heirs to remortgage {{what remained of the}} estate. The family's fortunes never fully recovered, and by the late 1670s they no longer lived in Little Moreton Hall, renting it out instead to a series of tenant farmers. The Dale family took over the tenancy in 1841, and were still in residence more than 100 years later. By 1847 most of the house was unoccupied, and the deconsecrated Chapel was being used as a coal cellar and storeroom. Little Moreton Hall was in a ruinous condition; its windows were boarded up and its roof was rotten.|$|E

Unlike members of other minority groups (e.g., ethnic and racial minorities), most LGB individuals are not raised <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> similar others from whom they learn about their identity and who reinforce and support that identity. Rather, LGB individuals are often raised in communities that are either ignorant of or openly hostile toward homosexuality.|$|E

25|$|With digital publishing, Fiztpatrick {{envisions a}} shift in the {{accepted}} conception of authorship from a solitary enterprise with a definite endpoint {{in the creation of the}} text to one of writing within a community as part of an ongoing process. This change is a result of the capabilities of word processing, which allows for the swift and simple revision of text, and the digital networking, which enables linking, reader commentary, and version control. By releasing text to be read and commented upon online authorship becomes ongoing, process-oriented work taking place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> interested readers.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{effect of}} (1) covariance between environment and competition, and (2) species-specific {{response to the}} environment decouple the strongest intraspecific and interspecific competition experienced by a species. Intraspecific competition is strongest when a species is favored by the environment, whereas interspecific competition is strongest when its rivals are favored. After this decoupling, buffered population growth limits the impact of interspecific competition when a species is not favored by the environment. As a consequence, the impact of intraspecific competition on the species favored by a particular environment exceeds that of the interspecific competition on species less favored by that environment. We see that the fundamental requirement for species coexistence is fulfilled and thus storage effect is able to maintain stable coexistence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> competing species.|$|E

500|$|Whereas the {{sociologist}} Loretta Orion {{had believed}} that contemporary Paganism was a postmodern movement, <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>Community</b> <b>of</b> Witches, Berger argued against this, instead considering Wicca to be a religion of late modernity. In supporting this position, Berger {{turned to the}} work of the British sociologist of religion, James A. Beckford (1942), who in his book Religion and Advanced Industrial Society (1989) had argued that many new religious movements reflect the characteristics of late modernity by challenging traditional definitions of religion, sharing a holistic worldview and emphasising the development and transformation of the self. Berger stated that while [...] "Wicca is not specifically mentioned by Beckford, it does fit the model of New Age religions that he is analyzing." [...] Whilst accepting that elements of postmodernism can be found within Wicca, Berger argued that the religion does not [...] "signify an epistemological break with Enlightenment thought", and that as such it was intrinsically late modernist in structure; as she related, the [...] "emphasis on globalism, the belief in personal and social transformation, and the use of noninstrumental rationality place Wicca firmly within the Enlightenment tradition." ...|$|E
500|$|Helen Berger, then a {{lecturer}} in {{sociology at the}} West Chester University of Pennsylvania, had initially {{become involved in the}} study of the Pagan movement in preparation for a series of public lectures that she gave at the Boston Public Library in October 1986. Based on the subject of the historical witch trials that took place in New England during the Early Modern period, she devoted the final lecture in the series to an examination of the contemporary Pagan Witches, or Wiccans, then living in the area. Having yet to perform the sociological investigation that would culminate <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>Community</b> <b>of</b> Witches, Berger gained her information for this lecture from the information published in the works of Margot Adler, Starhawk and Marcello Truzzi, and also from a singular interview that she had carried out with a woman who was [...] "peripherally associated" [...] with Paganism. After the lecture, several audience members approached Berger to identify themselves as practicing Wiccans, and it was through them that she came into contact with the New England Pagan community. Three of the Wiccans at the lecture invited Berger to [...] "participate as a researcher" [...] as they founded their own coven, the Circle of Light, and she attended their weekly meetings and festival celebrations for the next two years.|$|E

500|$|In July 1623, {{two more}} ships arrived: the Anne, {{under the command}} of Captain [...] "Master" [...] William Peirce and Master John Bridges; and the Little James, {{under the command of}} Captain Emanuel Altham. These ships carried 96 new settlers, among them Leideners, {{including}} William Bradford's future wife Alice, and William and Mary Brewster's daughters Patience and Fear. Some of the passengers who arrived on the Anne were either unprepared for frontier life or undesirable additions to the colony and returned to England the next year. According to Gleason Archer, [...] "those who remained were not willing to join the colony {{under the terms of the}} agreement with the Merchant Adventurers. They had embarked for America upon an understanding with the Adventurers that they might settle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> their own, or at least be free from the bonds by which the Plymouth colonists were enslaved. A letter addressed to the colonists and signed by thirteen of the merchants recited these facts and urged acceptance of the new comers on the specified terms."

2500|$|Another {{significant}} distinction can be {{made between}} what medical statisticians call incidence and prevalence. For example, even if two studies agree on a common criterion for defining a sexual orientation, one study might regard this as applying to any person who has ever met this criterion, whereas another might only regard him/her as being so if they had done so during {{the year of the}} survey. According to the American Psychological Association, sexual orientation refers to an [...] "enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes", as well as to [...] "a person's sense of identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> <b>of</b> others who share those attractions." [...] Therefore, a person can be celibate and still identify as being bisexual or homosexual based on romantic proclivities.|$|E

40|$|Three {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{in order to examine}} (1) what can be measured with three commonly used Dutch self-report personality questionnaires, and (2) which instrument is most suitable for measuring personality in The Netherlands. In Study 1, the relationships between the Five Factor Personality Inventory (FFPI) and the Dutch Personality Questionnaire (DPQ) were examined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> sample <b>of</b> 329 participants. In the second study, the relationships between the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) and the DPQ were examined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> sample <b>of</b> 275 participants. Finally, in the third study the relationships between the DPQ, EPQ and FFPI were examined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>community</b> sample <b>of</b> 254 participants. There are considerable relationships between all three questionnaires. The factor structures in all three studies are very similar, suggesting that a total of four personality dimensions can be assessed using these self-report personality questionnaires: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conformity and Egoism. The factor Egoism can only be measured with the DPQ. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
