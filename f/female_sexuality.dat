5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian and bisexual women as part of feminism.|$|E

5|$|Beyonce has crafted her brand around {{embracing}} femininity and <b>female</b> <b>sexuality.</b> Although as Dr. Cheryl Thompson {{explains in}} her article “The sweet taste of lemonade: Beyonce serves up black feminist history most recent album,” Beyonce is only recently exploring the intersecting themes of feminism and black empowerment in her work. According to Thompson, Beyonce - like many other black female artists - has held back with her identity as a black woman {{for the sake of}} appealing to the masses. Like the SNL skit that pokes fun at white Beyonce fans that listened to “Lemonade” and realized {{for the first time that}} Beyonce is indeed a black woman, it is only very recently that the artist has transformed her feminist image into something more specific to the issues black women face. As Thompson explains, all of Beyonce’s previous albums were about feminism. “Lemonade” is about black feminism. The importance of having artistry like “Lemonade” in the mainstream is critical to examining the lived experiences of black women, and the racial and gender-based oppression that intersect to create a unique set of obstacles.|$|E
25|$|Spuhler's {{hypothesis}} is a stand-alone hypothesis of extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality.</b> Spuhler suggests that extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> has evolved as {{a by-product of}} an adaptation in females that increases the levels of adrenal hormones. He proposed that secretion of higher levels of adrenal hormones were initially selected in women {{in order to increase}} endurance for walking or running. This hypothesis suggests that the larger adrenal glands {{may have contributed to the}} development of extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> as they are also the main source of 'libido hormones', which increase the female's sexual drive. Thus, extended sexuality is little to do with sexual behavior, or evolutionary advantage, but rather it is just a by-product of hormones. However, this hypothesis cannot account for extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> in invertebrates, which lack adrenal systems. Additionally Spuhler highlighted the existence of larger thyroid and adrenal glands in humans compared to other primates. However, no empirical evidence has established the link between hormones and endurance walking as an adaptation and extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> as a natural incidental effect. As there are costs to extended sexuality, it can be argued that selection would serve the dissociation of extended sexuality from the mechanism that affects endurance walking.|$|E

In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film has been seen to incorporate a clash between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends one by one.

25|$|Extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> {{is where}} the female of a species mates when infertile. In most species, the female only engages in {{copulation}} when she is fertile. However, extended sexuality has been documented in old world primates, pair bonded birds and some insects (such as carrion beetles). Extended sexuality is most prominent in human females who exhibit no change in copulation rate across the ovarian cycle. Although this behaviour incurs costs to females, such as energy and time, many researchers have proposed reasons for its existence. These hypotheses include the male assistance hypothesis, which proposes that females gain non-genetic benefits (such as food and shelter) in exchange for sexual access. A sub-hypothesis of this is Hrdy's, proposing extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> as an adaptive process aiming to creating paternity confusion in males. Alternative hypotheses, classified as 'male-driven', claim that extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> occurs due to male adaptations, resulting from an inability to detect fertility status in females or to dampen immune responses against sperm. Finally, Spuhler's hypothesis suggests that the behaviour may have arisen as an incidental effect of larger adrenal glands in humans.|$|E
40|$|The South African Constitution prohibits {{discrimination}} on the basis of a variety of factors including race and gender and sexual orientation. This inclusion came in 1996 after an oppressive apartheid regime was overcome, also positioning the South African Constitution amongst the more liberal, especially in the wider African context. This inclusion and the contextual disparity has caused curiosity about the realities of same-sex sexualities, especially taking into consideration media reports on violence and perceived social opposition of same- sex sexualities in South Africa. Much of this attention has motivated research studies on same-sex sexualities. Within this research, however, black <b>female</b> same-sex <b>sexualities</b> have been positioned as vulnerable and victimised within the heteronormative context, with much of this research focusing on ‘corrective/curative’ rape. There has however been increasing efforts in moving away from this limiting position by a select few (e. g. Zanele Muholi and Zethu Matebeni) in a more explorative direction in attempts to investigate black <b>female</b> <b>sexualities</b> as complex and expressive rather than passive. This study is an interpretive phenomenological investigation of the lived experiences of black <b>female</b> same-sex <b>sexualities</b> and the plurality of identities that influence their everyday experiences. This took into account intersectionality, heteronormativity and queer theory, which provided a theoretical framework for this study. During the interview process, participants described their experiences as black same-sex females in a variety of contexts including their experiences and influences of external factors (such as family and university.

It is also rather interesting to point out that Güreş is more interested in ‘how the works will be read by women’. It is also this femininity that guides her artistic career in a way, as Güreş feels {{that she was able to}} study art because she is a woman, she adds that perhaps this is true of her generation, precisely because painting was seen as a sort of handicraft, thus they were able to study art.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT—Researchers have {{documented}} substantial {{variability in the}} development and expression of same-sex sexuality, especially among women, posing challenges to traditional linear developmental models. In this article, I argue for a new approach to conceptualizing the development and expression of <b>female</b> same-sex <b>sexuality</b> over the life course, based in dynamical systems theory. Dynamical systems models seek to explain how complex patterns emerge, stabilize, change, and restabilize over time. Although originally developed by mathematicians and physicists to model complex physical phenomena in the natural world, they have increasingly been applied to social-behavioral phenomena, ranging from motor development to cognition to language. I demonstrate the utility of this approach for modeling change over time in <b>female</b> same-sex <b>sexuality,</b> reviewing extant published research and also introducing data collected from an ongoing, 10 -year longitudinal study of young nonheterosexual women. I provide evidence that <b>female</b> same-sex <b>sexuality</b> demonstrates the emblematic features of a dynamical system: nonlinear change over time, spontaneous emergence of novel forms, and periodic reorganizations and phase transitions within the overall system. I highlight the specific contribution of a dynamical systems perspective for understanding such phenomena and suggest directions for future study. Research on the nature and development of same-sex sexuality seems to suggest that the more we learn, the more we do not understand. There was a period around the late 1980 s and earl...|$|R
25|$|This {{hypothesis}} {{has received}} much criticism.

25|$|Firstly, {{in species}} that {{demonstrate}} extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality,</b> {{there should be}} evidence that the males provide non-genetic resources to females. This prediction is supported {{in a variety of}} animals, with reviews revealing that male assistance (such as food or protection), is provided to certain mammals and communally breeding birds in exchange for mating outside the conceptive period. For example, female blackbirds that solicit mating outside the fertile period have increased mate guarding from their pair-bonded partner. This increases protection against other sexually coercive males and ensures the provision of other material benefits. In a review investigating primates that exhibit extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality,</b> it was noted that females engaging in extended sexuality benefited from increased offspring protection and paternal care from males.|$|E
40|$|Changing {{attitudes towards}} <b>female</b> (hetero) <b>sexuality</b> {{throughout}} {{the nineteenth and}} twentieth centuries are generally storied within Western societies as a move away from regulation and towards liberation. This narration of the (hi) story of <b>female</b> (hetero) <b>sexuality</b> is underpinned by a taken-for-granted assumption that in terms of sexual freedom, liberty and autonomy, these changes have been progressive and beneficial for women. The narrative study presented in this paper explores the ways in which a group of young women make sense of and narrate their unique sexual experiences and relationships. The implications of these findings are then discussed in terms of the options for negotiating sexual encounters that are made available or denied to young women by their appropriation of different narrative frameworks. This discussion raises questions about the degree to which young women in contemporary society can be considered to be sexually liberated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Nowhere {{on earth}} do men {{participate}} in contraception in larger numbers than do women. As highly effective forms of contraception for women have become widely available throughout the world, and as women became the crucial target of planned parenthood cam-paigns {{in the last}} several decades, decisions about birth control have increasing occurred in a female contraceptive culture. Men have been intentionally and inadvertently marginalized from responsibility for preventing pregnancy, including by the transnational pharmaceutical industry, national family planning agencies, religious institutions, and multilateral aid agen-cies and foundations. Through a cultural history of male contraception and ethnographic research on vasectomies in Oaxaca, Mexico, I explore men’s experiences in contemporary female contraceptive cultures. The low rate of male participation in contraception in Oaxaca is shaped by global structures and ideologies articulated in the modernist premise of dichoto-mous male and <b>female</b> <b>sexualities,</b> legitimated through flawed biological platitudes...|$|R
40|$|Against a {{backdrop}} of a ‘pornographication’ of mainstream media {{and the emergence of}} a more heavily sexualized culture, women are increasingly targeted as sexual consumers. In the UK, the success of TV shows like Sex and the City and the ‘fashion ‘n’ passion’ of sex emporia like Ann Summers suggests that late twentieth century discourses which foregrounded female pleasure have crystallised in a new form of sexual address to women. This article examines how sex products are being marketed for female consumers, focussing on the websites of sex businesses such as Myla, Babes n Horny, Beecourse, tabooboo and Ann Summers. It asks how a variety of existing discourses – of fashion, consumerism, bodily pleasure and sexuality - are drawn on in the construction of this new market, how they negotiate the dangers and pleasures of sexuality for women, and what they show about the construction of ‘new’ <b>female</b> <b>sexualities.</b> </p...|$|R
25|$|Although {{not found}} in all organisms, {{researchers}} have identified sexual intercourse patterns in certain animals that reflect extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality,</b> such as in some old world primates, birds and insects. Extensive {{research has focused on}} analysing the musk shrew's rate of sexual behaviour. The only period that is associated with a drop in female receptivity to copulation is during mid to late pregnancy; yet, even at this time, occasional mating is reported. Therefore, researchers have concluded that this animal has similar sexual receptivity across infertile and fertile phases. Within primates, research has consistently found evidence of extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> in the rhesus monkey and chimpanzees. Both of these primates mate at all stages of the ovarian cycle, with only slight increases in sexual receptivity during fertile stages, and decreases during menstruation.|$|E
25|$|Hrdy's {{hypothesis}} {{has been}} criticised, however, {{on the basis}} that some female primates show both extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> and sexual swellings. In terms of Hrdy's hypothesis these two concepts are incompatible. Sexual swellings appear only during the most fertile phase of the female's ovarian cycle, with the purpose of advertising fertility. In sharp contrast, according to Hrdy, extended sexuality is adapted to conceal fertility and ensure mating across all stages of the ovarian cycle, to aid paternity confusion.|$|E

5000|$|The {{character}} of Lulu {{has been described}} as embodying both elements of <b>female</b> <b>sexuality's</b> dualism, earth-mother and whore. In the words of Karl Kraus, she is the woman [...] "who became the destroyer of all because everyone destroyed her". Berg's involvement with the lower depths of society in his two dramatic works, Wozzeck and Lulu, surprised even Schoenberg. Like Wozzeck, Lulu is social criticism, a tragedy in which the protagonists are portrayed as victims, gradually becoming enslaved to social forces they are too weak to deal with. Palindromes in the piece take many forms, such as {{the rise and fall of}} Lulu and the recycling of the actors: the three men whose deaths she contributes become Lulu's three clients, and the man she murdered murders her. Alwa, thought to be the antithesis of Lulu, was changed from Wedekind's dramatist to Berg's composer, and is assumed to be a stand-in for Berg himself. In all cases the music underscores and confirms Berg's dramatic allusions.|$|R
25|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} mating in non-conceptive periods {{and to encourage}} males to maintain their proximity, males must possess imperfect knowledge of the female's fertility status. This is achieved through concealed ovulation in most animals that exhibit extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality.</b> A review of studies revealed that, in humans, females only exhibit subtle changes during estrus, {{making it difficult for}} males to assess fertility with precision. In the , for instance, females lack any overt signals of fertility and are continuously receptive to sexual intercourse, encouraging males to remain and provide resources.|$|E
25|$|Hrdy's {{hypothesis}} {{is an extension}} of the male assistance hypothesis, in that both hypotheses argue that women have evolved this adaptation to gain some tangible benefit from males. According to Hrdy's hypothesis, extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality</b> is an adaptive process with an aim of creating paternity confusion in their male counterparts. Paternity confusion refers to the male being unsure as to whether offspring are genetically his own. If the female mates with different males (at all points of her ovarian cycle) whilst concealing fertility, then the males will inevitably have paternity confusion.|$|E
25|$|Human {{females are}} {{considered}} to exhibit the greatest degree of extended <b>female</b> <b>sexuality,</b> with receptivity to sexual intercourse remaining constant across fertile and infertile phases of the reproductive cycle, including during pregnancy, lactation, and in adolescence.

The only notable drop in sexual behaviour occurred during menstruation. Therefore, women largely showed {{the same level of}} sexual behaviour in the non-fertile phases of their ovarian cycles as in the fertile phases.|$|E
40|$|I {{consider}} the apparent invisibility of lesbianism {{throughout the history}} of the Hispanic Caribbean, especially during the twentieth century, {{and the way in which}} certain environments simultaneously regulate, allow, and hide what are considered sexual 2 ̆ 2 deviancies. 2 ̆ 2 My thesis centers on the ways in which alternative <b>female</b> <b>sexualities</b> have found a voice in the Hispanic Caribbean during recent decades. I study the three discourses or tropes that do allow for the emergence of a 2 ̆ 7 lesbian voice 2 ̆ 7 during the late twentieth century: poetry, sexile (Manolo Guzmán), and the trope of 2 ̆ 7 the sexually undefined, 2 ̆ 7 in which writers approach sexuality simply as a practice, and refuse to provide or define a 2 ̆ 7 lesbian identity 2 ̆ 7 for their characters. Lastly, I show how both recent cinema and LGBTQ anthologies make an effort to develop a lesbian identity that would try to function within the public discourse. The assumption of lesbian invisibility is sustained by presenting how canonical literary works of the Hispanic Caribbean from early and mid-twentieth century portrayed deviant <b>female</b> <b>sexualities</b> as anomalous and unexplainable, thus proving that there was not yet a concept for referring to lesbianism. Chapter 1 establishes poetry as the first vehicle for an open lesbian identity within the Hispanic Caribbean. Various poets articulate a genealogy of lesbian writing, specifically, through the trope of motherhood and family ties. Chapter 2 considers works of narrative, and how they only shyly suggest a lesbian presence in the Caribbean, this through the role of the émigré. Chapter 3 focuses on the cinematic representation of lesbianism in the Hispanic Caribbean, especially during the last twenty years. This new role confronts challenges like the representation of lesbianism as a component of male heterosexual fantasies, and the disruptive nature imposed on the character. Chapter 4 contrasts two reconstructions of the lesbian stereotype produced by heterosexual males. The conclusion intends to portray the tensions between defining lesbianism as a practice or as an identity, together with their consequences, a discussion that the whole thesis thrives to establish. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{subjectivities}} of <b>females</b> practicing same-sex <b>sexuality</b> in Mexico City. These subjectivities are here viewed {{in relationship to}} recent economic transformations in Mexico and to ideas on gender and sexuality produced by diverse actors such as {{the gay and lesbian}} and feminist movements, government programs, the media, and the Catholic Church. While the individual subject is constructed through different dominant ideas, <b>female</b> same-sex <b>sexuality</b> in Mexico, offers an interesting case because most dominant ideas suggest that it cannot exist. Analyzing dominant ideas is, then, not sufficient to understand how subjectivities are constructed. Hegemonic ideas are pieced together to form subjectivities, but meanings on gender and sexuality are also produced by subjects that are here viewed as possessing a creative potential. Subversive ideas are not only considered reactive responses to hegemonic ideals but rather as an active shaping of life to make the everyday experience possible. The presentation of subjectivities here focuses on three main themes: Gender and sexual self-representation; love and sexuality; and, life with the family. The second part of the thesis presents three testimonies that have the potential of challenging fixed definitions of these women's identities and realities. This thesis contributes to the understanding of gender and sexuality in Mexico City from the unexplored location of <b>female</b> same-sex <b>sexuality,</b> and {{to the understanding of the}} effects on sexualities and subjectivities of the social and economic changes that have taken place in Mexico during the past decades...|$|R
