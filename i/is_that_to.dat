In practice, with Royal London the only maternal hospital nearby, few would today be born within earshot.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between clock pendulums and gravimeter pendulums <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> measure gravity, the pendulum's length {{as well as}} its period has to be measured. The period of freeswinging pendulums could be found to great precision by comparing their swing with a precision clock that had been adjusted to keep correct time by the passage of stars overhead. In the early measurements, a weight on a cord was suspended in front of the clock pendulum, and its length adjusted until the two pendulums swung in exact synchronism. Then the length of the cord was measured. From the length and the period, g could be calculated from equation (1).|$|E
25|$|The Glock 17P, 22P, and Glock 17R are all {{training}} pistols for practicing hand-to-hand combat, {{loading and}} unloading of the pistol. These Glocks are identical to a standard Glock 17/22 except for their red frame; some models have an inert barrel (without a chamber, thus preventing the accidental chambering of a live cartridge) and no firing pin hole in the breech face (preventing someone from using a live barrel with the training slide). The difference between models <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> perform a 'reset' of the trigger, a cycling of the slide has to be performed on the 17P/22P, {{but not on the}} 17R.|$|E
25|$|Some 'genuine' power {{retained}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> appoint the Chancellor, Pro-Chancellors and Treasurer, on {{the nomination}} of Council, to appoint the external auditors and to elect 15 of the lay members of Council. Note, however, that it can only select these (mainly ceremonial) posts on recommendation from other bodies and Court does not usually disagree with them. It also retains the power to remove its own members and those of Council, apart from those whose membership results from their office or from being members of the academic staff of the University. Thus most {{of the members of}} Court are excluded from this provision, though notably not most of Council, a situation the Privy Council does not seem concerned with.|$|E

25|$|It {{is often}} useful {{to compare the}} Americanist {{tradition}} with another widespread tradition, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Unlike the IPA, Americanist phonetic notation {{does not require a}} strict harmony among character styles: letters from the Greek and Latin alphabets are used side-by-side. Another contrasting feature <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> represent some of the same sounds, the Americanist tradition relies heavily on letters modified with diacritics; whereas the IPA, which reserves diacritics for other specific uses, gave Greek and Latin letters new shapes. These differing approaches reflect the traditions' differing philosophies. The Americanist linguists were interested in a phonetic notation that could be easily created from typefaces of existing orthographies. This was seen as more practical and more cost-efficient, as many of the characters chosen already existed in Greek and East European orthographies.|$|E
25|$|Rejecting a {{work is a}} {{very serious}} action and one which we do not take lightly. Where {{possible}} we try to consider cuts or, in the case of games, modifications which remove the material which contravenes the Board's published Guidelines. In the case of Manhunt 2 this has not been possible. Manhunt 2 is distinguishable from recent high-end video games by its unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone in an overall game context which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing. There is sustained and cumulative casual sadism {{in the way in which}} these killings are committed, and encouraged, in the game. Although the difference should not be exaggerated the fact of the game's unrelenting focus on stalking and brutal slaying and the sheer lack of alternative pleasures on offer to the gamer, together with the different overall narrative context, contribute towards differentiating this submission from the original Manhunt game. That work was classified '18' in 2003, before the BBFC's recent games research had been undertaken, but was already at the very top end of what the Board judged to be acceptable at that category. Against this background, the Board's carefully considered view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> issue a certificate to Manhunt 2, on either platform, would involve a range of unjustifiable harm risks, to both adults and minors, within the terms of the Video Recordings Act, and accordingly that its availability, even if statutorily confined to adults, would be unacceptable to the public.|$|E

500|$|... that, being closed loops, {{imply the}} {{presence}} of diverging integrals having no mathematical meaning. To overcome this difficulty, a technique called renormalization has been devised, producing finite results in very close agreement with experiments. It {{is important to note}} that a criterion for theory being meaningful after renormalization is that the number of diverging diagrams is finite. In this case the theory is said to be renormalizable. The reason for this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>to</b> get observables renormalized one needs a finite number of constants to maintain the predictive value of the theory untouched. This is exactly the case of quantum electrodynamics displaying just three diverging diagrams. This procedure gives observables in very close agreement with experiment as seen e.g. for electron gyromagnetic ratio.|$|E
