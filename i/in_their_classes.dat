5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students {{do not believe that}} the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through friends or relatives, which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E

He only took {{outright}} wins in lesser sports car racing events, {{such as at}} AVUS or the 500 km Nürburgring. The Abarths were hard to beat <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> from 850cc to 1600cc, though. Being the only pro in a small team Hermann {{learned a lot about}} testing and developing, which helped him later. However, being dissatisfied with the preparation of his car for the 1965 Schauinsland practice, Hans went home to witness the birth of his son, Dino.

He tells Elphaba that there is a conspiracy to stop the Animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it ("Something Bad").|$|E

When the auction is over, Bart reveals {{that he was the}} real Mrs. Knickertwist and that there is no money for the school. Frustrated over Bart's latest prank and pressured by his supervisor Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner challenges Chalmers to take over Bart's education. Chalmers accepts and immediately gives Bart his own lesson plan, which primarily consists of former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt. He makes Bart interested in the subject by talking about Roosevelt's heroic and rebellious nature. [...] Classmates Milhouse, Nelson, Jimbo, Kearney and Dolph soon join Bart in his education.|$|E

500|$|Because of {{the title}} of the Sports Illustrated story that {{compared}} Parker to LeBron James, Mike DeCourcy of Sporting News stated that [...] "Jabari Parker is, rather, the best [...] since Greg Oden." [...] In addition, Parker was considered to have a much less developed physique than James at the same stage of development. [...] CBS Sports' Jeff Borzello also contested the proclamation, pointing out that since James's 2003 class both Dwight Howard (2004) and Oden (2006) were consensus top players <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> and that Parker might not be any better than the most recent consensus, Oden. [...] In addition, CBS noted that Parker [...] "might not even be the best high school basketball player in the country, given the development of class of 2014's Andrew Wiggins." [...] Chicago Tribune writer Mike Helfgot described the Sports Illustrated comparison as [...] "incredibly irresponsible journalism", noting he had once worked for the Star-Ledger when it described Derrick Caracter as the next James.|$|E

2500|$|Bless Me, Ultima is a coming-of-age {{novel by}} Rudolfo Anaya [...] {{centering}} on Antonio Márez y Luna and his mentorship under his curandera and protector, Ultima. It {{has become the}} most widely read and critically acclaimed novel in the Chicano literary canon since its first publication in 1972. [...] Teachers across disciplines in middle schools, high schools and universities have adopted {{it as a way to}} implement multicultural literature <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classes.</b> The novel reflects Chicano culture of the 1940s in rural New Mexico. Anaya’s use of Spanish, mystical depiction of the New Mexican landscape, use of cultural motifs such as La Llorona, and recounting of curandera folkways such as the gathering of medicinal herbs, gives readers a sense of the influence of indigenous cultural ways that are both authentic and distinct from the mainstream.|$|E
2500|$|In Brazil, {{teaching}} of creationism in scientific education classes is forbidden by the Ministry of Education (MEC). Religious {{education is not}} forbidden as such, but the federal constitution states that the union can neither impose, nor promote, nor finance any religion, because by law Brazil is a secular state. In 2004 however, teachers of religious education classes in schools of the education department of Rio de Janeiro began to present creationism <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> as scientific fact. The practice was directly initiated by politicians in power who were promoting their personal religious views, and their action moved Brazilian scientists to protest the abuse. Subsequently, in congress a [...] "religious bench," [...] or faction, has become increasingly influential. For example, a Brazilian senator, Marcelo Crivella, the former , publicly declared his religiously founded antagonism to evolution. Such prominent influences have drawn {{the attention of the}} defenders of the secular state.|$|E

2500|$|Each {{episode of}} Arthur runs {{for half an}} hour. Episodes usually consist of two {{completely}} self-contained 11-minute stories. The episodes start off {{with one of the}} characters (usually Arthur) speaking towards the audience about a situation within the story followed by the title card. The episodes are separated by a one- to two-minute live-action interstitial called [...] "And Now a Word from Us Kids" [...] (or, in some cases, a permutation of that title more specific to its contents). The live-action segments almost always feature children from elementary schools (generally in the Boston area) presenting subjects they are currently learning about or projects they have been working on <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> (the subjects covered here relate to the first cartoon segment in the half-hour). This segment is seen exclusively on PBS telecasts of the show, filling space otherwise used for commercials, which are generally forbidden on PBS. There is also a segment that sometimes appears {{at the end of the}} second 11-minute episode called [...] "And Now a Word from Marc Brown" [...] where he shows the viewers how to draw various main characters from the show. In 2007, the show began encouraging viewers to send in [...] "video postcards" [...] (similar to those used in the spin-off show Postcards from Buster), which were shown in the interstitials of episodes until the middle of Season 12. Beginning with Episode 151, the show reverted [...] "And Now a Word from Us Kids".|$|E
2500|$|Contextual {{factors that}} {{individual}} teachers can affect often make the least difference on cheating behavior. A {{study found that}} increasing the distance between students taking an exam has little effect on academic misconduct, and that threatening students before an exam with expulsion if they cheat actually promotes cheating behavior. [...] Indeed, increased exam proctoring and other methods of detecting cheating in the classroom are largely ineffective. According to one survey of American college students, while 50% had cheated {{at least once in}} the previous six months, and 7% had cheated more than five times in that period, only 2.5% of the cheaters had been caught. As teachers invent more elaborate methods of deterring cheating, students invent even more elaborate methods of cheating (sometimes even treating it as a game), leading to what some teachers call a costly and unwinnable arms race. [...] Increased punishment for academic misconduct also has little correlation with cheating behavior. It has been found that students with markedly different perceptions of what the severity of the punishment for cheating were all equally likely to cheat, probably indicating that they thought that increased penalties were immaterial since their cheating would never be discovered. However, if a professor makes clear that he disapproves of cheating, either in the syllabus, in the first class, or {{at the beginning of a}} test, academic dishonesty can drop by 12%. [...] Some professors may have little incentive to reduce cheating <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>classes</b> below a point that would otherwise be obvious to outside observers, as they are rated by how many research papers they publish and research grants they win for the college, and not by how well they teach.|$|E
