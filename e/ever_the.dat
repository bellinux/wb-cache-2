5|$|After {{completing}} {{the list of}} 21 tropical cyclone names {{for the first time}} <b>ever,</b> <b>the</b> NHC began naming storms with the Greek alphabet. Epsilon was the fifth name of the list, and ultimately there was one additional storm, making the 2005 season the most active on record with 27named storms. Since Epsilon stayed well out to sea and never approached land, no warnings or watches were issued. No ships reported tropical storm force winds from Epsilon and there were no damages or fatalities.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} last in 1966–67, the Bruins {{qualified for}} the 1968 playoffs, their first appearance in the playoffs since the 1958–59 season. In the pre-season, the Bruins added Phil Esposito, Fred Stanfield and Ken Hodge from the Chicago Black Hawks {{in one of the}} most famous deals <b>ever.</b> <b>The</b> Bruins also added rookies Glen Sather and Derek Sanderson, developing a more aggressive image that led to the nickname of the 'Big Bad Bruins.' The Bruins, happy to make the playoffs, were swept by eventual champion Montreal in the first round.|$|E
5|$|Benin {{took part}} in the 2008 Summer Olympics, which were held in Beijing, China from 8 to 24 August 2008.

5|$|A co-production of the United States and the United Kingdom, The Dark Knight was {{released}} on July 16, 2008 in Australia, on July 18, 2008, in North America, and on July 25, 2008, in the United Kingdom. Considered by film critics {{to be one of}} the best films of the 2000s and one of the best superhero films <b>ever,</b> <b>the</b> film received highly positive reviews and set numerous records during its theatrical run. The Dark Knight appeared on more critics' top ten lists (287) than any other film of 2008 with the exception of WALL-E, and more critics (77) named The Dark Knight the best film of 2008 than any other film released that year. With over $1billion in revenue worldwide, it is the 29th-highest-grossing film of all time, unadjusted for inflation. The film received eight Academy Award nominations; it won the award for Best Sound Editing and Ledger was posthumously awarded Best Supporting Actor. The Dark Knight Rises, the final film in the trilogy, {{was released}} on July 20, 2012.|$|E

5|$|After initial preparations, the Americans and French {{built their}} first {{parallel}} {{and began the}} bombardment. With the British defense weakened, on October 14, 1781 Washington sent two columns to attack the last major remaining British outer defenses. A French column took Redoubt No. 9 and an American column took Redoubt No. 10. With these defenses taken, the allies were able to finish their second parallel. With the American artillery closer and its bombardment more intense than <b>ever,</b> <b>the</b> British position began to deteriorate rapidly and Cornwallis asked for capitulation terms on October 17. After two days of negotiation, the surrender ceremony occurred on October 19; Lord Cornwallis was absent from the ceremony. With the capture of more than 7,000 British soldiers, negotiations between the United States and Great Britain began, resulting in the Treaty of Paris of 1783.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he took on}} {{a variety}} of jobs {{including}} school bus driver, farmer, deacon and cosmetics salesman, the latter of which he performed well past his 100th birthday. He received the Victory Medal, a special medal from the Mississippi National Guard and the French Légion d'honneur. In 1999, the Mississippi Legislature adopted a resolution recognizing him as an outstanding citizen of Mississippi. At the time of his death, at the age of 112, he was recognized as the oldest combat veteran <b>ever,</b> <b>the</b> oldest male ever recorded in Mississippi and the second-oldest man and World War I veteran in the world.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, he was the oldest United States combat veteran <b>ever,</b> <b>the</b> oldest male ever {{recorded}} in Mississippi and had outlived at least three of his eight children.

5|$|Custine's son, Renaud-Louis-Philippe-Francois, (b. in Paris in 1768 {{and died}} 3 January 1794), also called Armand, was a captain {{in one of}} the regiments in the Army of the Rhine. As a young man, he had {{traveled}} widely, and made a long study of the art of war in Berlin. Comte de Mirabeau, <b>ever</b> <b>the</b> politician, predicted that the young Custine would become a well-respected diplomat. By 1792, Armand was Nicholas Luckner's aide-de-camp; following Luckner's dismissal, he entered a brief embassy duty in Berlin in 1792 as chargé de affaires and eventually, as diplomatic relations between France and the rest of Europe became strained, he was a hostage for the safe return of Prussian and Austrian diplomats in Paris. His deceased mother had left him capital of 700,000 livres, making him a wealthy young man; it was assumed that his father would also settle a suitable amount on him upon his marriage as well as the family estates in Niderviller, which included six farms.|$|E
5|$|Dredd persuaded {{new chief}} judge McGruder {{to permit the}} {{citizens}} to vote in a referendum on whether democratic government should be restored, or the existing Judge System should be retained. McGruder agreed because the Judges had lost much of their credibility in failing to protect the citizens from the Dark Judges during Necropolis: since the Judges' argument in favour of their dictatorial rule rested largely on their allegedly unique ability to protect the city and preserve order (which the last elected government had conspicuously failed to do), the Democrats' calls for reform were consequently more compelling than <b>ever.</b> <b>The</b> Democracy Referendum was scheduled for 2113, and was not popular among the rank-and-file judges, or even the senior ranks, since almost everybody predicted that the unpopular Judges would lose the vote by a landslide. So much did the Referendum depend on Dredd's personal support that Judge Grice and other judges even tried to assassinate him to prevent the vote from going ahead.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{two nations}} were still working at cross-purposes. The British saw the IRBMs as a step {{on the path to}} an {{independent}} nuclear deterrent, while the Americans saw it as an augmentation of the Strategic Air Command (SAC). The Americans originally envisaged the employment of 120 Thor missiles in four USAF squadrons, the 672nd, 673rd, 674th and 675th Strategic Missile Squadrons, and four RAF squadrons, the first two of which would at first be manned by USAF personnel. The October 1957 Sputnik crisis caused this plan to be modified. It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment of missiles by a shocked and distraught nation. Sputnik demonstrated the Soviet Union's capability to deploy ICBMs. The United States now needed the IRBMs—and British cooperation—more than <b>ever.</b> <b>The</b> proposal to base USAF Thor squadrons in Britain was dropped on 12 October 1957.|$|E
