40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a grid-powered supply for {{supplying}} power LED used in illuminating application. The power supply consists of an <b>input</b> <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> which attenuates conducted high frequency signals (EMI filter), an active rectifier (PFC circuit) to improve the power factor and the main constant output current double-sided forward converter. It thoroughly focuses at design of the converter's power stage, mainly at pulse transformer, switching transistors, output rectifier and output filter. Main converter model {{was created in the}} Matlab-Simulink environment in order to simulate behaviour of the current loop. Final product of this work is a fully functional power supply and the main converter's model...|$|E
40|$|Metal oxide varistors (MOV) are popularly used {{to protect}} offline {{electronic}} equipment against power line transients. The offline switched mode power supplies (SMPS) use power <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> and MOVs in the front-end. The power <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> is used to reduce the conducted noise emission into the power line and the MOVs connected before this <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> and the MOVs connected before this <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> to clamp <b>line</b> transients to safer levels thereby protecting the SMPS. Because {{of the presence of}} 'X' capacitors at the <b>input</b> of <b>line</b> <b>filter</b> the MOV clamping voltage is increased. This paper presents one such case and gives theoretical and experimental results. An approximate method to predetermine the magnitude of such clamping voltages is also presented...|$|R
40|$|Charts {{relating}} the capacitance to the width, spacing, thickness and height {{above the ground}} plane of coupled microstrips have been obtained. These are used to design hairpin line and hybrid hairpin <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> as well as multiplexers using microstrip comb <b>line</b> <b>filters.</b> The experimental results agree reasonably well with the design specifications. Getsinger's original charts for parallel coupled bars between parallel plates have been formulated for the microstrip case. Corresponding charts {{relating the}} capacitances to the width, spacing, thickness and height above the ground plane of coupled microstrips have been obtained. Examples {{of the use of}} these charts are shown in the design of hairpin lines and hybrid hairpin <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> as well as multiplexers using comb <b>line</b> <b>filters.</b> The hairpin line/hybrid hairpin <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> were designed to operate at a central frequency of 9 ÃÂ· 5 GHz with 11 per cent bandwidth and 0 ÃÂ· 5 dB ripple. The three filters constituting the comb <b>line</b> <b>filters</b> have center frequencies of 2 ÃÂ· 4, 3 ÃÂ· 0 and 3 ÃÂ· 6 GHz. The components so designed were fabricated and tested. The dielectric used for the microstrip was teflon. Experimental curves for the attenuation (insertion loss) and VSWR are given. The design specifications arc satisfied quite well...|$|R

40|$|Mark de Berg Jit Bose David Bremner William Evans Lata Narayanan 1 Introduction Suppose {{the only}} access {{we have to}} an {{arrangement}} of n <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> is to "probe" the arrangement with horizontal lines. A probe returns the set of probe points which are the intersections of the probe's horizontal line (the probe <b>line)</b> with all <b>input</b> <b>lines.</b> We assume {{that none of the}} <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> is horizontal, so a probe <b>line</b> intersects every <b>input</b> <b>line.</b> Our goal is to reconstruct the set of <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> using a small number of probes. Aoki, Imai, Imai, and Rappaport [1] observed that if one is allowed to place the probe lines after seeing the results of previous probes, then the number of probes required is at most three. This paper addresses the problem of fixed probes; in our setting the locations of the probes must be chosen before the input is examined. We show that for each natural number n there is a set of n + 1 probe lines that will serve to determine any arrangement of n <b>input</b> <b>lines</b> and that [...] ...|$|R
