Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to honey bee colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and <b>foraging</b> <b>activity</b> of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{movement}} of workers is associated with temperature, and foraging workers leave the nest after sunrise when the nest is warmed in the early morning. Meat ants emerge and start foraging when temperatures are approximately 14°C (57°F), but {{they are capable of}} withstanding extremely hot temperatures, as workers have been seen foraging in 43°C (109°F) heat. Workers may only forage for several minutes when soil temperature is well above their thermal limit at 45.8°C (114°F). At 50°C (122°F) (soil surface temperature), <b>foraging</b> <b>activity</b> is reduced even further. As these ants exhibit high running speeds during hot days, their speed decreases after temperatures of 50°C due to the physiological stress put onto them. Workers can withstand such temperatures by exhibiting opportunistic thermal responses to adjust their behaviour in order to handle high trail temperatures and alter their thermal biology for low temperatures. They will also deliberately expose themselves closely to their thermal maxima.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{factors such}} as time spent outside and {{distance}} travelled by workers has been correlated to colony size. Workers living in smaller colonies tend to forage smaller distances and spend less time outside, whereas those in larger colonies spend more time outside and at greater distances from their nest. Such results have also {{been seen in the}} western honey bee (Apis mellifera), but, unlike the honey bees, workers from small and large colonies transported equal workloads. The decreased foraging time may reduce the risk of predation and save energy; for example, the limited energy in R.aurata is a result of time spent looking for food sources, rather than the collection of food items. The shorter foraging periods seen in smaller colonies results in these nests preserving energy and adopting behaviour that is less energetic. Group retrieval only occurs if a worker encounters another nestmate that is heavily loaded with resources. As these ants are solitary foragers and rarely recruit other nestmates, the chance of a worker encountering others is improved by marking the ground with trail pheromones. This behaviour may serve as a simple method of localised chemical recruitment of other nestmates. Marking behaviour increases when workers encounter large prey items, which suggests that foragers with heavy loads deliberately try to raise the encounter rate with nestmates. However, when workers are transporting small to large crickets, marking behaviour decreases to ensure transport efficiency and lower the retrieval time for other ants. Workers can quickly readjust their <b>foraging</b> <b>activity</b> in accordance with food quality.|$|E

25|$|Generally, wasps {{are unable}} to predict heavy rainfalls. They {{continue}} their <b>foraging</b> <b>activities</b> even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests.

Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} {{individuals}} in a colony varies. A mature nest of several years old can hold between 11,000 and 64,000 ants, while other colonies can house around 300,000. In some cases, enormous colonies can {{have as many as}} a million ants. Observed colonies are known to contain nearly 70,000 larvae and 64,000 workers; some can have 20,000 males and over 1,000 virgin queens, but others may have more virgin queens than males. The ratio of worker ants to the number of the larvae in colonies ranges from one worker for every two larvae or two larvae for every worker. The population of a nest can be affected or altered by several factors: human interference can severely damage or completely destroy nests which potentially devastates the nest population, and overshadowing is the main cause of a nest's demise. As well as that, neighbouring nests may increase in population if damaged or abandoned sites are taken over. Meat ants also rely on their nests to withstand climatic stress in summer and winter, as <b>foraging</b> <b>activity</b> and food sources are sometimes limited in summer, and in winter plant growth is almost impossible and workers are unable to survive cold temperatures. As a result, meat ants overwinter, which is a process where some organisms wait out the winter season due to cold conditions making everyday activity and survivability almost impossible; populations may be affected greatly.|$|E
25|$|The first brood {{of workers}} {{are all of}} normal size, but the next {{generation}} of workers are generally smaller. This is due to the decrease in the queen's <b>foraging</b> <b>activity</b> after producing the first batch of larvae.

25|$|The {{earliest}} P. exigua foragers {{leave the}} nest around 6am and foraging stops around 7pm. <b>Foraging</b> <b>activity</b> {{has been recorded}} from 11 to 12 am. In the hot and humid season, P. exigua exhibit greater nest activity than {{in the cold and}} dry season. Although the foraging of wasps decreases in rainy weather, the delivery of food and nest material does not stop completely. The habitat temperatures directly correlate with wasp activity: as the temperature increases, so does worker foraging. Luminosity has also been reported to influence {{the beginning and the end}} of the species’ <b>foraging</b> <b>activity.</b> Luminosity seems to have a greater affect on wasp activity when temperatures are more moderate. Additionally, wind speed directly impacts wasp activity; the stronger the wind, the less likely wasps are to exit their nests. Silva (2002) suggests P. exigua participate in a greater amplitude of activity as the latitude of their nesting region decreases. In other words, the closer the wasps are to the Equator, the more active the colonies are. In Ribeiro Jr.’s study on P. exigua from Brazil, he proposed that the wasp develops its foraging activities more efficiently within a flight range of 75m from its nest.|$|E

25|$|The <b>foraging</b> <b>activity</b> of Vespula vulgaris is {{dependent}} on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2°C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2°C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be – i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.|$|E

40|$|Ecological factors, such as {{predation}} {{pressure or}} survival rate, affect social structure (e. g., gyny or founding modes) in social insects. Multiple females may cooperatively found a nest under severe ecological conditions. In bivoltine sweat-bees, most nests {{in the first}} reproductive period include a single female, but nest organization changes to cooperative in the second period. This fact predicts low predation pressures during the first period. However, {{few studies have examined}} corresponding changes between nest organization and predation pressures in social insects. Here, we compare the predation pressure between the two reproductive periods by using a sweat bee, Lasioglossum baleicum, that shifts the social organization from solitary to cooperative between the two reproductive periods.

The <b>foraging</b> <b>activities</b> vary among bee populations depending on temperature conditions.

25|$|Queens {{and males}} are {{unlikely}} to forage since female workers will collect and capture resources for the colony. P. exigua females have been observed carrying orange-colored crops with some solid material that is most likely chitin filled. These chunks seem to be larvae structures of insects belonging to the order Lepidoptera (Dias 2006). There are butterfly and moth fragments of thoracic legs with spines and claws, parts of abdominal legs, pieces of the head cuticle with sensory setae, and apparently parts made of trachea and muscle tissue. P. exigua were observed to transfer complete batches of nest material more often after {{the appearance of a}} new generation of workers. In this post-emergence phase, colonies grow a lot, thus <b>foraging</b> <b>activity</b> amplifies. Colonies in the post-swarming stage exhibit a decrease in activity.|$|E
25|$|Intermediates are {{workers with}} fully {{developed}} ovaries. These wasps are non-inseminated laying females, {{and they are}} present throughout the entire colony cycle. Intermediates lay eggs, but the eggs are eaten either by themselves or by other colony members. It is possible that non-inseminated laying females are always present {{in order to provide}} extra energy in the colony. Their eggs may be used for trophic purposes, since male production is controlled entirely by queens. This oophagy (egg eating behavior) can provide additional sustenance for the colony. Inseminated workers are typically older and are likely to have been potential queens at colony initiation. Therefore, non-inseminated egg layers are young and seem to be about to swarm. In a study on P. exigua <b>foraging</b> <b>activity,</b> a higher proportion of workers than intermediates were observed in all the colonies.

The comb is suspended from a leaf or branch {{by one or more}} peduncles, with an exit-hole on the side or bottom of the envelope. The nests are also observed to provide many entrance holes, which seem to be a unique feature to the species. On average, there are 1.7 combs and 566 cells per colony. While P. exigua nests typically have one comb, additional combs are sometimes found on certain nests. Cells with brown wafers of meconium towards the bottom indicate that there has been an emergence of new larvae; this discoloration {{is the result of the}} larva shedding its waste products during pupation. P. exigua tend to build their nests in locations facing west; it is suggested that this specific placement leads to higher environmental temperatures and proportionally greater <b>foraging</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E

Both the <b>foraging</b> <b>activities</b> of individuals in the Spruce A timber in excavating tunnel-galleries and the nest-founding activities of the royal pair in the other two timbers were observed to occur on the springwood, and the termites were seen to avoid the summerwood (Figs.  2, 3, 4).|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} <b>foraging</b> <b>activity</b> of P. fraternus {{occurs during}} the hottest {{part of the}} day, which is usually between noon and 2:30pm. There is a positive correlation of temperature and foraging behavior and a negative correlation between humidity {{in the air and}} foraging behavior. There was the greatest foraging (bringing back the most food) during the pre-emergence phase of the colony cycle because of increased nest construction and a large nutritional demand from the brood. Foraging is important because the nest needs water to maintain a certain temperature. It also needs wood pulp to construct and repair cells and sugary substances like nectar and honeydew to feed the brood and adults. Protein of animal origin is also required to feed to the larvae. When workers are bringing back food and building materials it slows their flight down. There are food foragers, nectar foragers and water foragers. Foragers with distended abdomens that exchange liquid at the nest entrance are most likely water foragers; while foragers with normal abdomens that exchange liquids inside the nest are nectar foragers. Prey and pulp are easy to see in the wasp's mandibles, and so these wasps were more easily identified as food and material foragers.|$|E
25|$|In the colony, {{the queen}} is {{responsible}} {{for all of the}} foraging for the nest until workers mature. This includes foraging for wood to make into pulp for the nest as well as food for the larvae. Most workers begin to help with foraging the day after they emerge from the nest as adults. Almost immediately, they take over all <b>foraging</b> <b>activity</b> for the queen. The behavior of the workers who forage differs depending on their activity. Those trying to catch flies move quickly from one flower head to the next and pounce on prey when it is found. In comparison, wasps that forage for nectar move slower and spend more time at each flower. Other workers collect pulp from dead wood to use for nest construction. It appears that if the wasp is unable to quickly catch a fly it goes on to collect nectar suggesting one worker does not always collect the same type of material. Different amounts of time are given to each activity with the most time spent gathering fluid, then pulp, and then flies. Foraging takes place from roughly sunrise to sunset of each day in order {{to keep up with the}} resources needed for the colony.|$|E
25|$|In {{comparison}} to other ant species like Anoplolepis gracilipes, which rapidly take over areas {{they have been}} contained in, red imported fire ants are fairly easy to control. The first proposals to controlling the ant occurred in 1957 when the United States Congress authorised an eradication program using federal and state funding. Research on the ant and its biology has been continuous after {{the establishment of an}} eradication program, and many chemicals were used to eliminate them. However, scientists discovered that these insecticides were killing native fauna, and the Environmental Protection Agency subsequently outlawed them. Some scientists even questioned whether the ants were pests or not. Today, {{it is unlikely that the}} red imported fire ant will be eradicated in areas such as the United States. Populations can be managed properly if an integrated approach is used. Some scientists have considered using the ants' natural enemies against it; this includes T. solenopsae and B. bassiana. Phorid flies have also been viewed as potential biological agents, as they can reduce <b>foraging</b> <b>activity</b> in red imported fire ants and affect population levels. However, they are unable to affect colony growth rate. In addition, parasitic ants, parasitic wasps, mites, other pathogens, nematodes, and fungi have been considered to be potential biological agents. Others suggest that populations can be maintained or reduced by manipulating several ecological factors.|$|E

25|$|Generally, American {{black bears}} are largely crepuscular in <b>foraging</b> <b>activity,</b> though may {{actively}} feed at any time. Up to 85% {{of the black}} bear's diet consists of vegetation, though they tend to dig less than brown bears, eating far fewer roots, bulbs, corms and tubers than the latter species. When initially emerging from hibernation, they will seek to feed on carrion from winter-killed animals and newborn ungulates. As the spring temperature warms, black bears seek new shoots of many plant species, especially new grasses, wetland plants and forbs. Young shoots and buds from trees and shrubs during the spring period are also especially important to black bears emerging from hibernation, as they assist in rebuilding muscle and strengthening the skeleton and are often the only digestible foods available at that time. During summer, the diet largely comprises fruits, especially berries and soft masts such as buds and drupes. During the autumn hyperphagia, feeding becomes virtually the full-time task of black bears. Hard masts {{become the most important}} part of the black bear's diet in autumn and may even partially dictate the species distribution. Favored masts such as hazelnuts, oak acorns and whitebark pine nuts may be consumed by the hundreds each day by a single black bear during fall. During the fall period, American black bears may also habitually raid the nut caches of tree squirrels. Also extremely important in fall are berries such as huckleberries and buffalo berries. Black bears living in areas near human settlements or around a considerable influx of recreational human activity often come to rely on foods inadvertently provided by humans, especially during summertime. These include refuse, birdseed, agricultural products and honey from apiaries.|$|E
