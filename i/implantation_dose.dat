40|$|Abstract Diamond is {{nowadays}} {{regarded as}} a potential semiconductor material of the future, due to its extreme and unique properties. Some of these properties, in- clude its high hardness, highest breakdown ¯eld, high Debye temperature, high thermal conductivity, high hole and electron mobilities, large bandgap and op- tical transparency, among others. These properties make diamond suitable for high-temperature, high-speed and high-power electronic applicatons, {{as well as in}} other applications. However, defects associated with ion implantation have been shown to make it rather di±cult to obtain n-type doping in diamond. As such, an {{understanding of the nature of}} defects produced during ion implanta- tion of diamond remains a subject of great importance, if not essential, for the optimization of high-temperature, high-power electronic applications in partic- ular. In this respect, this study investigates the nature of the radiation damage generated within the collision cascades of multi-implantations of carbon ions in high-pressure, high-temperature single-crystal synthetic type Ib diamond, spread over a range of energies (50 - 150 keV) and doses. This is achieved by means of the cold-implantation-rapid-annealing (CIRA) routine, and the anal- ysis of damage caused was done by using cross sectional transmission electron microscopy techniques. More precisely, the modes used to achieve this are the bright ¯eld transmission electron microscopy (BFTEM) coupled with selected area di®raction or SAD. At low <b>dose</b> <b>implantation</b> or at sub-critical <b>implantation</b> <b>doses</b> (2. 5 x 1015 ions/cm 2), it was found that the ion-damaged diamond layer consists of some threading dislocations, not homogeneously distributed which propagate from the surface into the ion-damaged diamond. In contrast to the sub-critical <b>implantation</b> <b>doses,</b> it was found that at very high <b>implantation</b> <b>doses</b> (7. 0 x 1015 ions/cm 2), i. e., above the critical dose (where diamond transforms to graphite upon annealing), the damaged diamond layer had some unconventional defect features close to the implanted surface...|$|R
