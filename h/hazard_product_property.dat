Crosslinking of the polymer resulted in a higher polymer melt viscosity. It was demonstrated that not only the <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> but also the process characteristics were strongly influenced by the addition of divinylbenzene to the reaction mixture. The <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> changed as expected: more crosslink agent led to a higher molecular weight or an increase in gel fraction, and a much higher melt viscosity of the polymer.

40|$|Purpose - On {{the basis}} of {{empirical}} studies this paper aims at identifying and analysing <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> that affect performance of end-of-life systems for {{electrical and electronic equipment}} (EEE). Design/Methodology/Approach – The research was carried out as case studies of end-of-life management of EEE. Case A focused on disassembly of computer screens and TV-sets, whereas Case B addressed logistics systems for recycling of various types of EEE. Data collection methods include interviews, on-site visits and observations, video recording, and studies of documents. Findings – Nine <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> that affect performance of end-of-life systems for EEE are identified. The properties relate to three different product levels: the product assortment level, the product structure level, and the component level. A model is presented which indicates that choices made and decisions taken in the product development process affect the end-of-life system performance. Application of modular product architectures and component standardisation are suggested as relevant design strategies during product development. Practical implications - The implications for managers are that the findings presented in this paper provide strengthened arguments that modular product architectures and component standardisation are favourable approaches to apply in product development. Complementary to the benefits for manufacturing and logistics also end-of-life system performance will improve when these approaches are applied. Originality/Value - Previous research has indicated some <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> that are supposed to influence performance of end-of-life systems. These properties originate primarily from conceptual discussions rather than empirical studies. This paper add to current understanding by presenting empirically based insights regarding which specific <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> affect performance.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{consumer}} electronic product industries have been confronted {{with an increase in}} consumer complaints. Interestingly about half of the reasons for product return are based on so called ‘soft problems’, consumer complaints that cannot be traced back to technical problems. Probably this phenomenon results from technological changes as well as user diversity. Therefore, this PhD project focused on how soft problems are related to <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> and user characteristics. In the study three types of soft problems were identified, related to sensory, functional, and operational qualities. Based on the categorization, the relationship between types of soft problems, <b>product</b> <b>properties,</b> user characteristics and follow-up (re) actions were investigated. In the studies people expressed a huge amount of complaints about a large variety of electronic products, all of which can be defined as soft problems. Overall, all studies revealed that soft problems are partly related to <b>product</b> <b>properties,</b> user characteristics and follow-up (re) actions. In order to make these findings useful for design practice, two methods were proposed and discussed: an interactive tool and a workshop approach. This study gives an overview of how user characteristics and <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> interact with <b>product</b> use. When these aspects are taken into consideration in the product development process, the seriousness of potential problems can be identified. The data found and the methods developed can contribute to better design that will increase consumer satisfaction. Industrial DesignIndustrial Design Engineerin...|$|R

We introduce two {{conditions for the}} set of orbits, called respectively g-almost <b>product</b> <b>property</b> and uniform separation <b>property.</b> The g-almost <b>product</b> <b>property</b> holds for dynamical systems with the specification property, but also for many others. For example all β-shifts have the g-almost <b>product</b> <b>property.</b> The uniform separation property is true for expansive and more generally asymptotically h-expansive maps. Under these two conditions we compute the topological entropy of saturated sets. If the uniform separation condition does not hold, then we can compute the topological entropy of the set of generic points, and show that for any invariant probability measure µ, the (metric) entropy of µ {{is equal to the}} topological entropy of generic points of µ. We give an application of these results to multi-fractal analysis and compare our results with those of Takens and Verbitskiy (Ergod. Th. & Dynam. Sys. 23 (2003)). 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Owing to {{the notion}} of a normal {{adjacency}} for a digital product in [8], the study of <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> of digital topological properties has been substantially done. To explain a normal ad-jacency of a digital product more efficiently, the recent paper [22] proposed an S-compatible adjacency of a digital product. Using an S-compatible adjacency of a digital product, we also study <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> of digital topological properties, which improves the pre-sentations of a normal adjacency of a digital product in [8]. Besides, the paper [16] studied the <b>product</b> <b>property</b> of two digital covering maps in terms of the LS- and the LC-property of a digital product which {{plays an important role in}} studying digital covering and dig-ital homotopy theory. Further, by using HS- and HC-properties of digital products, the paper [18] studied multiplicative properties of a digital fundamental group. The present paper compares among several kinds of adjacency relations for digital products and pro-poses their own merits and further, deals with the problem: con-sider a Cartesian product of two simple closed ki-curves with li elements in Zni, i ∈ { 1, 2 } denoted by SCn 1,l 1 k 1 × SC n 2,l 2 k 2. Since a normal adjacency for this product and the LC-property are differ-ent from each other, the present paper address the problem: for the digital product does it have both a normal k-adjacency of Zn 1 +n 2 and another adjacency satisfying the LC-property? This research plays an important role in studying <b>product</b> <b>properties</b> of digital topological properties...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{construct}} torsion-free hyperbolic groups without unique product whose subgroups {{up to some}} given finite index {{are themselves}} non-unique product groups. This is achieved by generalising a construction of Comerford to graphical small cancellation presentations, showing that for every subgroupH of a graphical small cancellation group there exists a free group F such that H ∗ F admits a graphical small cancellation presentation. The unique <b>product</b> <b>property</b> was introduced {{as a way to}} prove Kaplansky’s zero-divisor conjecture [Kap 57] on the group ring of a torsion-free group [Coh 74]. A group G is said to have the unique <b>product</b> <b>property</b> if every pair of non-empty finite sets A,B of G admits a unique product, that is, if there exists c ∈ G for which there exist unique elements a ∈ A and b ∈ B satisfying c = ab.
