5|$|Acute pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease is highly unlikely when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used. A sensitive serum pregnancy test is typically obtained to rule out <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Culdocentesis will differentiate hemoperitoneum (ruptured <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy</b> or hemorrhagic cyst) from pelvic sepsis (salpingitis, ruptured pelvic abscess, or ruptured appendix).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other causes may produce similar {{symptoms}} including appendicitis, <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> hemorrhagic or ruptured ovarian cysts, ovarian torsion, and endometriosis and gastroenteritis, peritonitis, and bacterial vaginosis among others.|$|E

30|$|Non-tubal <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{account for}} only 5 % of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> but they {{contribute}} {{a disproportionate number of}} serious complications. Their diagnosis may be difficult and they are associated with significant haemorrhage leading to a higher morbidity and mortality than tubal <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> is generally increasing; there {{also appears to}} be a concurrent increase in the proportion of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> that are IPs. The increase in {{incidence of}} IPs may be due to various factors, including better diagnosis, more prevalent pelvic inflammatory disease, pelvic surgery, and assisted reproductive techniques [3, 4]. IPs account for 2 – 6.8 % of all <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> [5 – 7].|$|R
30|$|The {{proportion}} of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> treated by laparoscopic surgery {{can be increased}} by the appointment of consultants with special interest in this area. The time taken to treat <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> laparoscopically {{is the same as}} that taken for laparotomy.|$|R
5|$|Official Church {{teaching}} {{allows for}} medical procedures and treatments {{intended to protect}} or restore the mother's health if {{she would be in}} mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus. Examples include the removal of a fallopian tube {{in the case of an}} <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> removal of a pregnant cancerous uterus, or an appendectomy.|$|E
5|$|PID {{can cause}} {{scarring}} inside the reproductive system, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy</b> (the {{leading cause of}} pregnancy-related deaths in adult females), and other complications of pregnancy. Occasionally, the infection can spread to in the peritoneum causing inflammation {{and the formation of}} scar tissue on the external surface of the liver (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
30|$|Management of cornual <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{is another}} area of difficulty. Studies using medical {{management}} with methotrexate have reported failure rates approaching 35 %. In comparison, various surgical modalities have demonstrated better success rates (72 – 95 %) [2]. However, they offer no protection against recurrent cornual pregnancies and have implications for future pregnancies. As yet, the incidence of recurrent interstitial pregnancy is unknown. For tubal <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> recurrence rates are 10 % overall for both surgical (laparoscopic) and medical management with methotrexate [3]. In this report, we describe the management of a patient who developed two consecutive cornual <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> in a year preceded by two tubal <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> on the same side.|$|R
40|$|Of {{clinical}} pregnancies in our {{in vitro}} fertilisation (IVF) programme, 5. 4 % were ectopic and 0. 85 % of clinical pregnancies (15 % of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies)</b> were heterotopic. <b>Ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> were more common after IVF/embryotransfer (ET) than frozen embryotransfer (FET). Although there was a suggestion that tubal factors were more common in those with <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> the difference did not reach statistical significance. No relationship existed {{with regard to the}} ovarian stimulation regimen, the dosage/duration of human menopausal gonadotrophin used, the details of embryo transfer and number of embryos transferred.

5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sterilization}} {{is considered}} a permanent procedure, {{it is possible to}} attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse. Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent. Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal. Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.|$|E
25|$|An <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{should be}} {{considered}} as the cause of abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding in every woman who has a positive pregnancy test. The primary goal of diagnostic procedures in possible <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy</b> is to triage according to risk rather than establishing pregnancy location.|$|E
30|$|Over the 5  years form 1997 to 2001 we audited all 384 <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{that were}} treated surgically. The rate of surgically treated <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{expressed}} {{as a proportion of}} maternities ranged from 1.17 to 1.5 %. During this time the proportion of these pregnancies treated laparoscopically rose from 28 % to 66 %, with the most rapid increases occurring following the appointment of gynaecologists with a special interest in laparoscopic surgery. The mean time taken to treat <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> surgically was the same regardless of whether the procedure was performed by laparotomy of laparoscopy.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{majority}} of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> are {{located within the}} fallopian tube. Nevertheless, pregnancies {{have been reported to}} implant in the cervix, ovary, interstitial tubal segment, and at various intra-abdominal sites. The diagnosis and treatment of these unusual implantation sites presents a challenge for clinical as well as radiological diagnosis and {{there is a tendency to}} overlook its possibility. In this study, we attempt to summarize the current data regarding diagnosis and optimal treatment of these unusual <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> from our experience with six unusual types of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> from the Women Hospital, Doha, Qatar...|$|R

30|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> are still managed surgically. There is, however, great scope for {{the increased use of}} non-surgical management options, especially as increasingly more <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> are diagnosed in women who are stable and at lower levels of serum hCG. A select group of non-ruptured tubal <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> should be offered medical management in the form of methotrexate as it is safe and obviates the need for surgical intervention. Resolution is expected in up to 90 % of these cases. A select few will be suitable for expectant management, with successful resolution seen in up to 88 % of cases. Trials comparing expectant management to current practices are needed to evaluate its benefit or otherwise.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the best management options in decision making in cases of cervicoisthmic and cesarean scar pregnancies and rare forms of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> with high rates of pregnancy-related morbidity in the first trimester, more commonly associated with assisted reproductive medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a literature review of the description of a case report of a cervicoisthmic pregnancy near a cesarean scar in a premature ovarian failure woman. She obtained pregnancy after ovum donation, hormonal therapy, and in vitro fertilization. The researchers focused on the MEDLINE/PubMed database articles on <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> particularly on cesarean scar pregnancies, cervical <b>pregnancies,</b> and <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> after in vitro fertilization in English-language journals published from January 1996 to December 2011. RESULTS: The conservative or nonconservative options for medical or surgical treatments are disposables. Moreover, in literature, no consensus was found about the best treatment method. CONCLUSIONS: Obstetricians should pay great attention to a possible cesarean scar pregnancy in patients with risk factors in their medical history. Until now, the rarity of these findings does not allow {{the definition of a}} commonly accepted management, so the best personalized approach may be guided by early recognition, close surveillance, and appropriate counseling. Further investigations are necessary to recognize high-risk factors for all <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and those unique to cesarean scar <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies...</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{laparoscopy}} or laparotomy {{can also}} be performed to visually confirm an <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> This is generally reserved for women presenting with signs of an acute abdomen and/or hypovolemic shock. Often if a tubal abortion or tubal rupture has occurred, {{it is difficult to}} find the pregnancy tissue. A laparoscopy in very early <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy</b> rarely shows a normal looking fallopian tube.|$|E

25|$|A {{persistent}} <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{refers to}} the continuation of trophoblastic growth after a surgical intervention to remove an <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> After a conservative procedure that attempts to preserve the affected fallopian tube such as a salpingotomy, in about 15-20% the major portion of the ectopic growth may have been removed, but some trophoblastic tissue, perhaps deeply embedded, has escaped removal and continues to grow, generating a new rise in hCG levels. After weeks this may lead to new clinical symptoms including bleeding. For this reason hCG levels {{may have to be}} monitored after removal of an <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancy</b> to assure their decline, also methotrexate can be given at the time of surgery prophylactically.|$|E

30|$|There {{are only}} a few cases in the English {{literature}} about advanced <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> successfully treated with the laparoscopic method. This method of treatment of such <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> is still debatable [4, 5]. The PubMed search identified only one case of laparoscopic treatment in advanced (14 th week) interstitial pregnancy [5]. Our article describes an additional case of successful laparoscopic treatment of unruptured isthmic pregnancy at the 13 th week of gestation.|$|R
30|$|Despite its rarity, cornual (interstitial) {{pregnancy}} poses {{a significant}} diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, and carries a greater maternal mortality risk than ampullary <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> In general, {{the rate of}} deaths from <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> has not declined since the last Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) report, and is still an increase on the rates described for 1991 – 1993. There were ten deaths from ruptured ectopic pregnancies: eight in the extrauterine tube {{and one in the}} interstitial portion of the tube (cornual pregnancies). In the previous report, four deaths were related to cornual pregnancy. Cornual pregnancies account for 2 – 4 % of <b>ectopic</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and are said to have a mortality rate in the range 2.0 – 2.5 % [1].|$|R
