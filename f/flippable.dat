In this paper, we revisit the problem of data embedding for binary images and investigate the incorporation of a most recent steganography framework known as the wet paper coding to improve the embedding capacity.

The flip-graph has the triangulations as vertices, and it has two triangulations adjacent if one can be obtained from the other by replacing one single edge (an edge whose incident triangles form a convex quadrilateral, called a <b>flippable</b> edge). We demonstrate that the flip-graph of the triangulations of the n×n lattice is an induced subgraph of the (3 n² − 2 n) -dimensional hypercube (no such embedding in a hypercube of smaller dimension is possible).

For two of the NP-hard maximization problems we provide for any constant ε> 0, factor (1 −ε) approximation algorithms that run in 2 O(1 /ε) ·n and 2 O(1 /ε 2) ·n time (when the Delaunay triangulation is given). For a third NP-hard problem the NP-hardness proof provides an inapproximability result. Our results are presented for the class of first-order Delaunay triangulations, but also apply to triangulations where every triangle has at most one <b>flippable</b> edge.

40|$|Watermarking is a {{technique}} of hiding information in image including scanned text, figures, and signatures {{in such a way}} that it is difficult to intercept. In this paper, we discuss hard authentication for detecting tampering in binary images. Morphological transform domain is selected to avoid quantization errors introduced in real valued transform domain. Instead of using Detail coefficients as location map for data hiding locations, flipping of an edge pixel in binary image is viewed as shifting of edge location one pixel vertically and horizontally. To track these edges, algorithm based on Interlaced Morphological Binary Wavelet Transform (IMBWT) is used. We process an image as 2 x 2 pixel blocks called main processing blocks. This allows flexibility in tracking edges and reduces computational complexity. Flip ability of a coarse signal is determined by considering 3 x 3 blocks which consist of both main processing block and subsidiary blocks. In Single Processing Case (SPC), a coarse signal is considered <b>flippable</b> if both horizontal and vertical edges exist. Orthogonal embedding i. e. flipping the candidates of one does not affect the flippability conditions of another is used in Double Processing Case(DPC) and DPDC. This increases capacity of data hiding. RSA public key algorithm is used to generate hard watermark. Experimental results demonstrate validity of our argument.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{investigated}} {{the possibility of}} executing DNA-based computation in living cells by engineering Escherichia coli to address a classic mathematical puzzle called the Burnt Pancake Problem (BPP). The BPP is solved by sorting a stack of distinct objects (pancakes) into proper order and orientation using the minimum number of manipulations. Each manipulation reverses the order and orientation {{of one or more}} adjacent objects in the stack. We have designed a system that uses site-specific DNA recombination to mediate inversions of genetic elements that represent pancakes within plasmid DNA. Results Inversions (or "flips") of the DNA fragment pancakes are driven by the Salmonella typhimurium Hin/ hix DNA recombinase system that we reconstituted as a collection of modular genetic elements for use in E. coli. Our system sorts DNA segments by inversions to produce different permutations of a promoter and a tetracycline resistance coding region; E. coli cells become antibiotic resistant when the segments are properly sorted. Hin recombinase can mediate all possible inversion operations on adjacent <b>flippable</b> DNA fragments. Mathematical modeling predicts that the system reaches equilibrium after very few flips, where equal numbers of permutations are randomly sorted and unsorted. Semiquantitative PCR analysis of in vivo flipping suggests that inversion products accumulate on a time scale of hours or days rather than minutes.

To achieve blind watermark extraction, {{it is difficult to}} use the detail coefficients directly as a location map to determine the data-hiding locations. Hence, we view flipping an edge pixel in binary images as shifting the edge location one pixel horizontally and vertically. Based on this we propose an morphological binary wavelet transform to track the shifted edges, which thus facilitates blind watermark extraction with support of cryptographic concepts. In existing block-based approach, in which the block size is taken as 3 * 3 pixels or larger,and then we insert the text into that particular blocks and they are using morphological binary wavelet transform. now we propose an alternative approach to the above approach i. e we process an image in 2 * 2 pixel blocks.

40|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} beta-turn features in peptides and proteins are the type I and type II turns, which differ mainly in {{the orientation of the}} central peptide unit. Facile conformational interconversion is possible, in principle, by a flip of the central peptide unit. Homologous crystal structures afford an opportunity to structurally characterize both possible conformational states, thus allowing identification of sites that are potentially stereochemically mobile. A representative data set of 250 high-resolution (less than or equal to 2. 0 Angstrom), non-homologous protein crystal structures and corresponding variant and homologous entries, obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, was examined to identify turns that are assigned different conformational types (type I/type II) in related structures. A total of 55 examples of beta-turns were identified as possible candidates for a stereochemically mobile site. Of the 55 examples, 45 could be classified as a potential site for interconversion between type I and type II beta-turns, while ten correspond to flips from type I' to type II' structures. As a further check, the temperature factors of the central peptide unit carbonyl oxygen atom of the 55 examples were examined. The analysis reveals that the turn assignments ape indeed reliable. Examination of the secondary structures at the flanking positions of the <b>flippable</b> beta-turns reveals that seven examples occur in the loop region of beta-hairpins, indicating that the formation of ordered secondary structures {{on either side of the}} beta-turn does not preclude local conformational variations. In these beta-turns, Pro (11 examples), Lys (nine examples) and Ser (seven examples) were most often found at the i + 1 position. Glycine was found to occur overwhelmingly at position i + 2 (28 examples), while Ser (seven examples) and Asn (six examples) were amongst the most frequent residues. Activation energy barriers for the interconversion between type I and type II beta-turns were computed using the peptide models Ac-Pro-Aib-NHMe and Ac-Pro-Gly-NHMe within the framework of the AM 1 semi-empirical molecular orbital procedure. In order to have a uniform basis for comparison and to eliminate the distracting influence of the deviation of backbone dihedral angles from that expected for ideal beta-turns, the dihedral angles phi(i+ 1) and psi(i+ 2) were fixed at the ideal values (phi(i+ 1) = - 60 degrees and psi(i+ 2) = 0 degrees). The other two angles (psi(i+ 1) and phi(i+ 2)) were varied systematically to go from type II to type I beta-turn structures. The computational results suggest that there exists one stereospecific, concerted flip of the central peptide unit involving correlated single bond rotation that can occur with an activation barrier of the order of 3 kcal/mol. The results presented here suggest that conformational variations in beta-turns are observed in protein crystal structures and such changes may be an important dynamic feature in solution...|$|E
40|$|A {{workshop}} on stable oceanographic research platforms {{was held at}} the Marine Physical Laboratory June 29 - 30, 1987. Research needs of several scientific disciplines, including physical oceanography, air-sea interaction, biological oceanography (especially bio-optics), and acoustics were discussed in detail with respect to the advantages of various stable platforms. This workshop was stimulated by recent requests involving the use of FLIP in weather conditions beyond its original capabilities, with more equipment and people than it can hold, and by the naval architect's opinion that FLIP, after 25 years of service, may be approaching the need for some expensive structural rework. While the immediate purpose was to consider requirements for a new FLIP, the workshop adopted a much broader approach recognizing the unique advantages of different stable platforms for particular research needs. The physical oceanography, bio-optics, and acoustics communities, from their experience working with FLIP, cited very specific reasons for a new FLIP with increased capabilities for rough weather operation (100 foot wave survivability, 60 - 80 foot wave operations), improved laboratory, living and working spaces and increased power capability. It should continue to retain deep water mooring capability, and to present a minimal cross-sectional area both in air and water. SWATH ships and submarines, stable platforms with mobility, were also discussed. In addition to their ability to provide improved work platforms for a variety of oceanographic experiments in higher sea states, small high-speed SWATH ships could increase dramatically the sampling region about a moored or drifting stable platform. Small submersibles, manned or autonomous, could also be launched and recovered from a large platform using present technology. For expeditious gathering of data under the Arctic ice pack, a manned research submarine is virtually the only means by which this area can be studied. The payload capability of a <b>flippable</b> barge or a larger FLIP could make possible all-weather operations possible with either autonomous or manned submersibles, by providing them with a deep underwater garage for launch and recovery. A track system for bringing the vehicle through the surface to a station for crew rotation and resupply would eliminate the dangers from rough seas associated with present operations. The acoustics community also was interested in the capabilities of a large semi- submersible from the standpoint of handling very large and powerful sound sources as well as for deploying multiple acoustic arrays for three dimensional measurements of the ambient noise field. The biological community also was interested in a large platform such as a semi- submersible which would he suitable for time-series studies and which would have resupply capability at sea for logistics as well as personnel rotation. Typically, large rigs can pick up 300 ton packages from resupply vessels. Such large lift capabilities also enhance the utility of a large platform to launch and recover highly mobile vehicles to capture and return for analysis samples with minimum delay time, a key unique feature of an Iron Island station for biologists along with the stability necessary for high accuracy laboratory work at sea. Similarly, a moored rig would make possible long term benthic studies including sampling by remote underwater manipulator (RUM) type vehicles which have already been used by the biological community in deployments from the Research Platform ORB. Results of an NSF funded study on the need for long time-series measurement studies, while not presented at the workshop, are included since they complement and reinforce our conclusions. The scale of operations for large platforms, especially semi-submersibles, becomes {{similar to that of the}} Deep Sea Drilling Project, requiring steady use by a large base of scientists that may require an international effort in order to be economically feasible. The unexpected, rather broad, pluralistic approach this workshop adopted in considering requirements of the research community for stable ocean platforms made the proceedings both more interesting and complex. A wide variety of platform types was considered, all of which already exist in some form. Each had unique contributions for satisfying the particular requirements of various research communities for stable ocean platforms. It may be, as we focus on the realities of operations and needs, that hybrid combinations of existing platforms will evolve as candidates for future use. Just as the original FLIP was designed as a simple platform for a particular acoustics experiment but with other potential users in mind, its evolution as a platform useful to other interests may serve as a model for the development of future larger stable platforms. Twenty-five years of operations have demonstrated the value of RIP FLIP as a platform for collecting time-series data on physical characteristics of the ocean. Twelve years of operations of SSP KAIMALINO have demonstrated the value of the SWATH ship as a mobile platform for research and development in demanding sea conditions. Floating stable platforms offer the possibility of measurements in higher sea states and wider latitude variations, of "sea truth" measurements for observations from space, and for coordinated multi- disciplinary time-series measurements of oceanic ecosystems...|$|E
