40|$|Abstract. According to the {{characteristics}} of AVS video data, a RTP <b>encapsulation</b> <b>method</b> based on frame type is proposed. When the video data is encapsulated by the RTP protocol, different types of video data such as sequence header, sequence end, I frame, P frame and B frame are encapsulated with different method. Under the limit of maximum transmission unit (MTU), sequence headers, sequence ends and I frames are encapsulated individually to reduce the packet length and protect the important data. While multiple P frames and B frames are encapsulated into one RTP packet to reduce the quantity of the RTP packets and decrease the overload of link. Simulation results show that, compared to the frame-based <b>encapsulation</b> <b>method,</b> the proposed method can reduce the packet loss rate of the video data effectively and {{improve the quality of}} video service...|$|E

40|$|We {{report a}} {{monolithic}} thin-film <b>encapsulation</b> <b>method</b> that satisfies {{the most popular}} requirements for on-wafer packaging: low temperature, low cost, hermetic, and RF compatible. The key for this new nano-porous thin-film <b>encapsulation</b> <b>method</b> is the technique to produce a large free-standing porous alumina membrane on-chip by post-deposition anodization of aluminum at room temperature. A porous alumina membrane allows for the diffusion of gas or liquid etchants through the nano-pores into the cavity to etch the sacrificial material, freeing the movable structures encapsulated inside. Subsequent vacuum sealing was achieved by depositing a thin film over the nano-porous alumina shell in a vacuum deposition tool, with no detectable penetration of the sealing material owing to the nano-pores with a high aspect ratio (> 30). The process, done at a low temperature, produced a hermetic vacuum seal and demonstrated an exceptionally low RF insertion loss: < 0. 1 dB up to 40 GHz. 1...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the primary}} drugs used in {{treatment}} of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is L-asparaginase (ASNase), which despite its therapeutic efficacy, faces challenges often faced in protein drug treatment: the immunogenicity and short half-life of the drug. In order to overcome these major challenges, the red blood cell (RBC) <b>encapsulation</b> <b>method</b> has been employed to prevent degradation by serum proteases and elimination by reticuloendothelial system, thereby increasing circulation half-life of the protein drug. However, the encapsulation methods used thus far, such as hypotonic dialysis/resealing and electroporation, showed compromise in the oxygen transport function and structural integrity of RBCs. Herein we introduce a novel RBC <b>encapsulation</b> <b>method</b> that involves low molecular weight protamine (LMWP), a protein transduction domain (PTD) peptide. Protein drug was first conjugated to LMWP via disulfide bond and the cell penetrating property of LMWP allowed encapsulation of protein drug into RBCs as verified by the confocal microscopy images. The optimal encapsulation condition {{was determined to be}} 37 °C for 30 minutes. Hematological parameters as well as SEM and osmotic fragility curve of LMWP-ASNase encapsulated RBCs showed that the structural integrity was maintained while Hill coefficients and pO 50 values indicated oxygen transport functionality was maintained. LMWP-mediated <b>encapsulation</b> <b>method</b> considerably increased the circulating half-life of ASNase compared to that of the hypo-osmotic rupture/resealing method and improved the survival time of tumor-bearing mice by 44 % compared to the saline control group.
