During the first night, as <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes {{that in the long}} history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{returned}} to Transylvania {{and started to}} rule it {{for the second time}} after 20 August 1260. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> jointly invaded Bulgaria and seized Vidin in 1261. His father {{returned to}} Hungary, but Stephen continued the campaign alone. He laid siege to Lom on the Danube and advanced as far as Tirnovo in pursuit of Tsar Constantine Tikh of Bulgaria. However, the Tsar succeeded in avoiding any clashes with the invaders and Stephen withdrew his troops from Bulgaria {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E

5|$|Because <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> held strong anti-communist beliefs, Koubek {{decided to}} flee Czechoslovakia after the Communist coup d'état of February 1948. He tried {{to cross the}} border into the American Zone of Occupation of Allied-occupied Germany, and failed. A second attempt in July succeeded. Koubek emigrated to the United Kingdom in October 1948, where he worked in a brickyard, as a {{draftsman}} for the city of Gloucester and county of Gloucestershire, a draftsman for the Ministry of Works, and announcer for the Czech language news service of the BBC. He encountered his future wife, Eva, in a bookstore in London. Eva was born in Prague, the daughter of a Czech Army officer. Her brother, whom she later rescued, was imprisoned in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of war on Henry by Prince Richard and King Philip II of France in 1187, Geoffrey was given command of {{a quarter of the}} English royal army. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> were driven from Le Mans, Henry's birthplace, in 1189. Geoffrey did not attend the subsequent conference at which Henry submitted to Philip immediately before Henry's death, unwilling to witness his father's humiliation, but he did help nurse him during his final days. Henry made a bedside wish that Geoffrey be made either Archbishop of York or Bishop of Winchester, and Geoffrey used his father's seal to make appointments to York after Henry's death. Geoffrey then escorted Henry's body to Fontevrault Abbey for burial. He {{was the only one of}} Henry II's sons present at his death.|$|E
5|$|Gossip {{was born}} in New York City on December 6, 1841, to George Hatfeild Gossip, an Englishman, and his wife Mary Ellen Dingley Gossip, of New York. When he was sixteen months old, his mother died; about two years later, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> moved to England. His aunt, Mrs. Reaston Rodes, raised him, {{apparently}} with little involvement by his father. Gossip grew up at Barlborough Hall, Derbyshire (the Rodes family seat) and at Hatfield, in Yorkshire. Both the Gossip and Rodes families are listed in Burke's Landed Gentry. He was educated at Windermere College, Westmorland, and won a scholarship to Oxford University, {{but was unable to}} attend as his father, uncle, and aunts lost a lawsuit that ruined them financially. As a result, Gossip had to support himself through his own labors.|$|E

5|$|The 2009–10 season proved {{successful}} for Stastny and the Avalanche. He stayed uninjured the entire season, and only missed one {{game as a}} healthy scratch after the Avalanche clinched a playoff spot the previous evening. His 79 points (20 goals, 59 assists) was a career best, and he led the team in points and assists. Tied with Alexander Ovechkin, only five {{players in the league}} ended up with more assists. Stastny's second career appearance in the post season ended after the San Jose Sharks eliminated the Avs in the first round. On January 26, 2011, Stastny was named to his 2nd NHL All-Star Game. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> became the 8th father-son duo in NHL history to both play in an All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|The peoples {{known to}} us as the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, began to arrive in Britain in the 5th century. By 600, a number of kingdoms had begun to form in {{southern}} and eastern Britain, and {{by the beginning of}} the seventh century, southern England was almost entirely under their control. Tytila was a member of the Wuffingas family, the ruling dynasty of the Kingdom of the East Angles that was named after his father Wuffa. The Wuffingas may have been descendants of an earlier Scandinavian dynasty. Both <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> are semi-historical figures.|$|E
5|$|Against his wishes, Jabara {{received}} a stateside leave for a publicity tour. The Jabara family {{grocery store in}} Wichita was thronged with people for days, and both <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> John appeared on local and national radio and television. Wichita mounted one of its most-attended parades in the city's history. Jabara was even sent on a goodwill tour with his father through the Middle East, and gave a speech in his father's hometown of Marjayoun, Lebanon. Film newsreels included footage of his aircraft and other accolades included his own song ("That Jabara Bird") and a ritual rewarding of his Distinguished Service Cross at a Boston baseball game. Jabara returned to the United States in May 1951 for temporary assignment to Air Force Headquarters, Washington, D.C. Two months later he {{was transferred to the}} Air Training Command at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. Upon his request, he returned for another tour of duty overseas, arriving in Korea in January 1953.|$|E

2500|$|Davey Allison's 1989 season did {{not start}} well. [...] A year after <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father's</b> one-two Daytona 500 finish, Davey started at 16th, then was {{involved}} in an early incident with Geoff Bodine that sent his car careening into the sand bar separating the track's backstretch from Lake Lloyd. [...] The car made one slow, complete, roll-over with Davey eventually restarting the car and driving {{it back to the}} pits. [...] He drove the damaged, hood-less car to a 25th-place finish and had a heated exchange with Bodine following the race (the first of several exchanges with other drivers during his career).|$|R
5|$|In November 1978, Evans {{broke the}} Western Australian {{record for the}} 100m breaststroke during his final year at school. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> decided that he should step up his {{swimming}} career, and Evans entered the 1979 Australian Championships in Perth. Despite only four weeks of solid training {{leading up to the}} meet, Evans came second to Lindsay Spencer. Evans was omitted from the Australian squad that toured Britain because he was an unknown swimmer. After the meet, Evans vowed to become an elite swimmer and Olympian. A week later, Evans travelled to England to train at Crystal Palace in London under David Haller, coach of future Olympic breaststroke gold medallist Duncan Goodhew. Evans did so feeling that there was insufficient coaching support for breaststrokers in Australia. In three months of training in London, Evans had risen up the breaststroke rankings from outside the top 200 into the top 25. He returned to Australia and won selection in the national team for the FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) World Cup in Japan, before returning to London for more training.|$|E
5|$|St. John's {{is one of}} North America's oldest European settlements, with {{fishermen}} {{setting up}} seasonal camps in the early 16th century. Sebastian Cabot declares in a handwritten Latin text in his original 1545 map, that St. John's earned its name when <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father,</b> the Venetian explorer John Cabot became the first Europeans to sail into the harbour, {{in the morning of}} 24 June 1494 (against British and French historians stating 1497), the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. However, the locations of Cabot's landfalls are disputed. A series of expeditions to St. John's by Portuguese from the Azores took place in the early 16th century, and by 1540 French, Spanish and Portuguese ships crossed the Atlantic annually to fish the waters off the Avalon Peninsula. In the Basque Country, it is a common belief the name of St. John's was given by Basque fishermen because the bay of St. John's is very similar to the Bay of Pasaia in the Basque Country, where one of the fishing towns is called St. John (in Spanish, San Juan, and in Basque, Donibane).|$|E
5|$|Following {{his return}} from the war to his {{hometown}} of Romney in June 1865, White was unable to recommence his practice of law or hold a public office due to the existing state laws of the Constitution of West Virginia which disbarred former Confederate States government and military personnel. White's situation was further complicated, as {{he had not been}} pardoned or paroled by the United States for his service in the Confederate States Army. White rented a farm in Hampshire County and engaged in successful agricultural pursuits until the disenfranchisement of former Confederates was struck from the state's constitution in 1872. In 1872, White was elected to the position of Clerk of Court for Hampshire County and began his term the following year in 1873. During his tenure as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County, White also served one term as Clerk of the Circuit Court between 1873 and 1876, but declined to run for a second term in that office. Prior to the American Civil War, White's father John Baker White had also served as the county's Clerk of Court for 47 years between 1815 and 1861. White served as Clerk of Court for Hampshire County for 29 years until 1902. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>father</b> served in the position a combined total of 76 years. Also following the war, White was elected {{as a member of the}} Romney Literary Society.|$|E
