5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, I think maybe, the most passionate {{one on the}} record. I mean, I'm really proud of it because that's really one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has really very good sexual images, images of cars - which <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E
500|$|In an 18 August 2006 Science Friday interview, Mike Brown {{expressed}} {{doubt that}} a scientific definition was even necessary. He stated, [...] "The analogy that <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to use {{is the word}} [...] "continent". You know, the word [...] "continent" [...] has no scientific definition ... they're just cultural definitions, and I think the geologists are wise to leave that one alone and not try to redefine things so that the word [...] "continent" [...] has a big, strict definition." ...|$|E

60|$|PRINCE PAUL. He {{can start}} to-night, Sire. I shall really miss you very much, Marquis. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> your taste in wines and wives extremely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Happy!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Sutton. [...] "Oh, yes, of course, Ephraim's always happy, {{in spite}} of his {{troubles}} and his rheumatism. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> Ephraim Prescott." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{asked by}} Rolling Stone editor, David Wild {{why he was}} {{performing}} the album again live after forty years, Morrison replied: [...] "It received no promotion, from Warner Bros.—that's why I never got to play the songs live. [...] I {{had always wanted to}} play the record live and fully orchestrated—that is what this is all about. [...] <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> live recording and I like listening to live records too. [...] I'm not too fond of being in a studio—it's too contrived and too confining. I like the freedom of live, in-the-moment sound." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} verse, Ross' lyrics are {{somewhat}} different, [...] "Red bottom Bawse house big as Baltimore" [...] and [...] "With a blonde bombshell trying {{to bond with}} your boy." [...] Additionally, he makes reference to strippers, as well as driving with a suspended drivers' license. Throughout the bridge, Carey sings about achieving despite surrounding odds: [...] "In spite of the chains that bind you/ You can see the mountain top/ It’s not too far." [...] Additionally, towards the last chorus, the singer releases a series of her [...] "signature" [...] high notes. During an August 2, conference call, Carey described how she felt working with the duo, and how she felt Ross' voice blended well with her own: [...] "Working with Ross and Meek on the same record was incredible. Obviously Ross is a star and everybody loves him. I'm a fan of his music," [...] said Carey on the collaboration. [...] "I really, really {{wanted to work with}} him. I love the tone of his voice. I think the contrast of his voice and mine would be something special. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to do collaborations that people might think are different." ...|$|E
500|$|Joel Keller of AOLTV complimented Jones in [...] "A Very Glee Christmas" [...] for [...] "shining in this storyline" [...] as Coach Beiste: [...] "Her {{scene as}} Santa, {{and then her}} knowing {{expression}} as she watched Artie walk, were the best moments of the episode." [...] The Atlantic Patrick Burns agreed: Jones's [...] "performance as the Santa Claus bearer of harsh reality was quite moving. It's nice to see her get to show her acting chops and refreshing to see her character's vulnerability." [...] Poniewozik also agreed, and said Jones [...] "has been remarkable", [...] "taking every ridiculous moment Glee has thrown at her and finding the true emotion {{at the core of}} the absurdity, which is what Glee at its best does." [...] A similar sentiment was expressed by VanDerWerff in his review of the following episode, [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle": [...] "I also like Coach Beiste because she’s one of the few characters who seems to grasp how insane some of this is. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> when a show that frequently goes over the top introduces someone who’s able to undercut some of that ridiculousness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{glad to hear}} of it. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> Dick. We were in {{the woods}} together. I hated to see him leave the valley. How's Belle?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I! <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> you. After {{what you}} have just said to me, I should be insensible indeed if I didn't respect and admire you as well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you mean. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> Tregear, and <b>I</b> am very sorry for him. If you would take it a little quieter, I {{think it would be}} better." ...|$|R
500|$|Jude Law {{stars as}} Joseph [...] "Joe" [...] Sullivan, a.k.a. Sky Captain: He {{commands}} a private air force {{known as the}} Flying Legion. His personal aircraft is a modified Curtiss P-40. In 2002, producer Jon Avnet showed Law the teaser trailer and the actor was very impressed by what he saw. He remembers, [...] "All I got at that early stage was that he'd used pretty advanced and unused technology to create a very retrospective look." [...] Avnet gave him the script to read and some preliminary artwork to look at. Law: [...] "What was clear was also that at the center was a really great cinematic relationship, which you could put into any genre and it would work. You know, the kind of bickering [...] <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to call it The African Queen meets Buck Rogers." [...] Avnet {{wanted to work with}} Law because he knew that the actor had [...] "worked both period, who worked both having theatrical experience, who worked on blue screen, who hadn't hit yet as a major action star." [...] The actor had just finished filming Cold Mountain (2003) and was intrigued at going from filming on real locations to working on a movie done completely on a soundstage. [...] Sky Captain would be one of three Jude Law films released by Paramount Pictures in 2004, along with the remake of Alfie (2004) and [...] Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events (2004). It also was one of six overall Jude Law films released that year.|$|E
500|$|A {{focus of}} Tang's {{art is the}} theme of {{national}} and cultural identities, I Was Born Japanese (1995) being an example. Tang notes that he has had four nationalities. He was issued with a Japanese birth certificate as he was born during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He became a British national after World War II, a Malaysian citizen when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, and a Singaporean citizen when Singapore gained full independence in 1965. While living in the UK he was conscious of his Chinese identity, but later on he took the view that he might not be fully Chinese since China had been occupied by the Mongols and Manchurians: [...] "I'm not sure if I'm 100% Chinese blood. I'm sure my ancestor has got mixture of Mongolian and even Thai and Miao people [...] We are all mixed, and this is true. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to think {{that there is only one}} race in the world. We are all one human race." [...] Another of Tang's performances, Jantung Pisang – Heart of a Tree, Heart of a People, centres around the banana tree. He was inspired by the fact that the banana is used widely in Southeast Asia as an offering to bring blessings, but is also feared as it is associated with ghosts and spirits. He also sees banana trees as a reminder of the lack of democracy in certain parts of the world: [...] "Democracy in many Asian countries and Third World countries is as shallow as the roots of a banana tree. We need to deepen [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|Maggie {{debuted in}} 2002. Hendrickson, at first, had a {{difficult}} time differentiating her from Frankie. [...] "Oh, my gosh, I was so afraid about that," [...] she said. [...] "I was trying to go for something completely different, but the problem was that the writers left it so ambiguous; the character was such a blank slate. I just decided to make her lighter, prettier [...] I kept the humor; <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to play a little bit of humor. And I was playing her straight [...] at first ! So I went for heterosexual, pretty, funny. And smarter!" ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{learned how}} to play chords and {{progress}} the chords—I got together at least 16 or 17 different keyboards for this album. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> orchestras and strings, so I composed a digital orchestra. RZA ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, we were friends. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> him. <b>I</b> {{used not to}} {{know what}} to think about him. Miss Anne Prettyman told me that it would be so; and once before I thought so myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was so nice}} to {{meet her}} again. She is such an honest, {{wholesome}} creature, and so bright and full of sense. She always {{made me think of}} the broad daylight. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> that girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So {{much the}} better,' growled Dennis--it was that amiable gentleman. 'She's quiet. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> 'em to faint, unless they're very tender and composed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank you, mistress," [...] said Tyrrel; [...] "but I {{have some}} {{drawings}} and colours in these saddle-bags, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> {{to carry them}} myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why must I, Mr. Wilson? One {{thing is}} {{suitable}} for one thing and one another, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> a color that {{is suitable for}} the occasion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we've got {{a pretty}} good houseful already," [...] said Willard thoughtfully. [...] "But I suppose if Aunt Josephina wants to come we'd better have her. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> Aunt Josephina, and so did Mother, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe Aunt Sally's {{bread is}} coming back to her after all," [...] said his wife. [...] "People used to be hard on Lovell. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> him and I'm real glad he's turned out so well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{we shook}} hands. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> the old cuss. He {{was a great}} reader--always talkin' about Napoleon--he'd been a great man if he'd ever got off the farm and into {{something}} that required just his kind o' brain-work.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you didn't {{sound like}} Ohio. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to make sure. Well, you must pull up. Mother, {{have you got}} {{anything}} fit to eat, this evening?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very well then, we will go. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> their dinners, {{because she}} comes from our {{neighbourhood}} and one always meets {{three or four of}} our Lincolnshire friends.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will it be very hot, Gregory?" [...] she asked, as {{they ate}} their meal. [...] "Not that I am afraid of heat, you know. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> summer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{were only}} a boy--a very nice boy, Jamie. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> you. <b>I</b> don't approve of long engagements, and I thought you'd change your mind. Most young men are a little wild; it's right that they should be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] {{said the}} countess; [...] "but I'm sure I shall {{be delighted to}} see anybody happy in the house again, and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> Lord Ballindine myself. There was never any trouble about his dinners or anything." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "This {{song was}} {{recorded}} in the late 1960s, and for some reason, it didn't get onto an album. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> it a lot and was glad when it was included on the 'Friends/20/20' two-fer. By the way, that's me singing the lead up high." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, yes, Mrs. Rowan. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to hear {{of young}} men getting married; that is when they've got {{anything}} to live upon. It makes them less harum-scarum like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! I {{am glad to}} know that, because <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to be put {{right when}} I am wrong,' said Rosa Dartle. 'You mean {{it is a little}} dry, perhaps?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Southward," [...] she answered. [...] "The {{other side}} of the Channel. That, at least, is something. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>like</b> to feel that there is sea between me and a place which I--loathe!" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. Lord Illingworth, {{there is}} one thing <b>I</b> shall <b>always</b> <b>like</b> you for.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm real {{glad you}} take that view of it, Louisa. I'm not displeased, either, {{although}} Mrs. Harmon would take my head off if she heard me say so. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> Lige. But <b>I</b> must say I'm amazed, too, after the way Sara used to rail at him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have hit}} it! I see why <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>liked</b> her, besides {{that it is}} {{pleasant}} to have any sort of visit, and a good scrimmage is refreshing; she is just what I should have been without papa and Edward to keep me down, and without the civilizing atmosphere at the park." ...|$|R
