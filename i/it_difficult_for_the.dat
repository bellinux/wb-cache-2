At the molecular level, repandiol is an alkylating agent. It inserts crosslinks between strands of DNA, making <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> genetic material to be expressed or replicated.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a wave of}} {{political}} reforms in the late 1990s, Antara began to produce its reporting independently {{of the government and}} was reorganized as a state-owned enterprise in 2007. However, media scholars argue that a lengthy relationship with the government makes <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> agency to become an unbiased news organization. Antara celebrated its 75th anniversary on 13December 2012.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in {{the second}} wave on Jig, the 56th Infantry Brigade was to capture Bayeux and a nearby ridge, thus cutting the N13 highway between Caen and Bayeux to make <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Germans to move in reinforcements. The second wave on King, the 151st Infantry Brigade, was tasked with {{capturing}} the Caen road and railway, along with setting up positions on high ground between the Aure and Seulles rivers. Other forces involved in the landing included artillery regiments, signals corps, and engineering units.|$|E
5|$|By 1907, Londoners {{had seen}} the network of deep tube {{underground}} railways expand from the original C line of 1890 with its six stations to a network of seven lines serving more than 70 stations. These companies, along with the sub-surface Metropolitan Railway and District Railway, criss-crossed beneath the city streets, competing with one another for passengers {{as well as with}} the new electric trams and motor buses. In several cases pre-opening predictions of passenger numbers had proven to be over optimistic. The reduced revenues generated from the lower numbers of passengers using the lines made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> operators to pay back the capital borrowed and pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

Under the English law, the [...] "warranty" [...] is a contractual promise which is not the condition of the contract, so the innocent party can only claim damages but not terminate the contact if there is breach of warranty.

5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with real-time environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a real-time engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the real-time engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment. Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E
5|$|South Sudan gained its {{independence}} from Sudan in 2011, but the South Sudanese Civil War made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nation to garner the support of five sport federations as required for its National Olympic Committee to gain recognition by the International Olympic Committee. Guor Marial, a South Sudanese refugee living in the United States, competed in the men's marathon at the 2012 Summer Olympics, but did so as an Independent Olympic Athlete after refusing to compete for Sudan. South Sudan became the 206th IOC member in August 2015, with the affiliations of track and field, basketball, association football, handball, judo, table tennis, and taekwondo. The nation chose Marial at its flagbearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Storylines often {{centred on}} new signings who {{were unable to}} settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style of play and {{expected}} the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for {{only three or four}} years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{had a large}} {{impact on}} the community, with only 1,600 {{people living in the}} two Russian settlements. The population in the communities do not speak Norwegian, and do not have a road connection to Longyearbyen. This made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Governor to give accurate and detailed information. Issues were further complicated by erroneous reports in Russian media that there were five survivors. The Governor's cabin in Barentsburg was manned during the aftermath, and bulletins were distributed with updated information in Russian. The accident was one of the triggers causing Arktikugol to abandon Pyramiden in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The large {{budget and}} notable talent {{for the project}} made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} company to secure directors {{willing to take on}} the series, causing 2009 to begin with a brief stir of media attention. Shortly thereafter, Taewon announced that the search was over and Kim Kyu-tae and Yang Yun-ho would be helming the series. Simultaneously, KBS was announced as the South Korean broadcaster. Later in the month, on February 19, Kim So-yeon was cast as a North Korean agent.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower than}} {{expected}} passenger numbers were {{partly due to}} competition between the tube and sub-surface railway companies, but the introduction of electric trams and motor buses, replacing slower, horse-drawn road transport, took {{a large number of}} passengers away from the trains. The problem was not limited to the UERL; all of London's seven tube lines and the sub-surface DR and Metropolitan Railway were affected to some degree. The reduced revenues generated from the lower passenger numbers made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> UERL and the other railways to pay back the capital borrowed, or to pay dividends to shareholders.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen {{to the city}} center had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements between {{the city and the}} company, in part because the two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminus. The municipality wanted it at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> company to build the tunnel through the city center to connect to the suburban tramways east of the city center. Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E
5|$|The state {{constitution}} had come under considerable criticism {{beginning in the}} 1840s because it allowed most government positions to be filled by appointment. The problem with this method of filling positions did not manifest itself until {{the advent of the}} state's political parties. Once in power, a party could stack the government with its own members, making <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> minority to regain power. Another problem was that the authority for many trivial issues were not delegated to other authorities. For example, if a man was to divorce his wife, the divorce bill had to be approved by the General Assembly before he or she could legally remarry.|$|E

The clouds were thinning out and visibility was improving. Braham decided it was now a folly to continue and decided to head for home. While flying over Funen island he spotted a building with a big Swastika flag draped from a pole. A car was parked outside the entrance. Believing it might contain someone of importance, he dived to attack, strafing the building and destroyed the car.|$|E

5|$|While on Washington's staff, Hamilton {{had become}} {{frustrated}} with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states. This lack of a stable source of funding had made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and to pay its soldiers. During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often {{unable or unwilling to}} contribute), and from European loans.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, {{to win a}} discrimination lawsuit against a state that maintained a literacy test, the Department needed {{to prove that the}} rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|As a precautionary move Alboin {{strengthened}} his {{alliance with}} the Avars, signing what Paul calls a foedus perpetuum ("perpetual treaty") and what is {{referred to in the}} 9th-century Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani as a pactum et foedus amicitiae ("pact and treaty of friendship"), adding that the treaty was put down on paper. By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories if the plan to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Although the {{traditional}} PID controller {{is widely used}} in many practical application fields, it’s unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> control of the complex plant. The powder metallurgy sintering process had such characteristics as nonlinearity and large delay, etc., and <b>it’s</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conventional PID controller to meet the control requirements. According to these traits, we used a parameter self-adjusting fuzzy controller to control the heating temperature of the vacuum sintering furnace. In practice it shows that every quality index and control effect of this scheme is better than that of traditional PID controller...|$|R
