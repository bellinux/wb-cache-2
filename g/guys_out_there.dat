Surrounding this fervor, Singh was misquoted as having said that Sörenstam [...] "didn't belong" [...] on the men's tour and that he would not play if he were paired with her. What he actually said is {{that he would not be}} paired with her because his playing partner was being selected from the past champion's pool. Singh later clarified, [...] "There are <b>guys</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> trying to make a living. It's not a ladies' tour.

5000|$|Other {{experts have}} {{suggested}} that the problem is that bloggers will cherry-pick information from the documents to solidify their own perspectives without putting the tidbits they find in an overall historical context.

You'll have <b>guys</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> with a smattering of Arabic drawing all kinds of crazy conclusions.

Jack's playboy issues stem from missing his mother. His unfaithfulness was a way of unconsciously punishing all women for his abandoning him.|$|R
