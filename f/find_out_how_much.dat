500|$|The tube frame design using {{steel core}} and {{perimeter}} columns protected with sprayed-on fire resistant material created a relatively lightweight structure that would sway more {{in response to}} the wind, compared to traditional structures such as the Empire State Building that have thick, heavy masonry for fireproofing of steel structural elements. During the design process, wind tunnel tests were done at Colorado State University and at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom to establish design wind pressures that the World Trade Center towers could be subjected to and structural response to those forces. Experiments were also done to evaluate how much sway occupants could tolerate. Subjects were recruited for [...] "free eye exams," [...] while the real purpose of the experiment was to subject them to simulated building sway and <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> they could comfortably tolerate. Many subjects did not respond well, experiencing dizziness and other ill effects. One of the chief engineers Leslie Robertson worked with Canadian engineer Alan G. Davenport to develop viscoelastic dampers to absorb some of the sway. These viscoelastic dampers, used throughout the structures at the joints between floor trusses and perimeter columns, along with some other structural modifications reduced the building sway to an acceptable level.|$|E
