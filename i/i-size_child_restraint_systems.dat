40|$|When small {{children}} travel in minibuses, during for example daycare transports, they seldom have adequate protection {{in terms of}} crash safety. To be sufficiently protected the child should travel in a rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> (CRS). The possibility to use such a seat is unfortunately accompanied by several problems. The main issues are {{that it can be}} hard and time consuming to secure a conventional <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> and that the available space in a minibus is limited. The task is therefore to develop a new system that makes it possible to easily secure the <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> in the bus, without compromising the space and mobility of the other passengers. This is done by using the newly developed anchorage system, Isofix, in combination with a small stand that replaces the bus seat.

The overall aim is to find factors that enables the increase in usage of rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems,</b> including the increase of usage time to as long as possible.   Swedish accident data, obtained by the Swedish Traffic Data Acquisation, was studied. It was found that the fatally injured children during car accidents in Sweden between the years 2000 - 2016 commonly were involved in extraordinarily accident scenarios with an outcome independent of how they were restrained. The literature study and the survey that was made were both supporting the statement of inconvenience while using rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems.</b> The inconvenience often corresponded to different types of misuse. The main issue with rearward facing according to the responding parents was lack of leg space, both for their child but also for the driver and the front seat passenger. These issues made some parents turning their children forward facing at early age, whereas they could still fit in the rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system.</b>   One key in order to increase the global use of rearward facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> lies in changes of the materials and design.

40|$|During {{the past}} 40 years, {{different}} <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> (CRS) {{have been developed}} to improve protection for children of different sizes and ages. Development of more effective CRS, and a higher frequency in use of the restraints, in addition to enhanced vehicle safety, has resulted in an increased level of child safety. This study examines accident data with Volvo cars in Sweden to evaluate child safety with respect to age, size and impact situation (including impact severity in frontal impacts); identifying optimal restraints as well as potential areas needing more attention. A total of 3670 children, aged 0 - 15 years, involved in car crashes 1987 - 2004 were selected from Volvo's statistical accident database. The injury-reducing effect of the <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> was high overall. The highest injury-reducing effect was found in rearward-facing <b>child</b> <b>restraints</b> for <b>children</b> up to 3 - 4 years of age, offering an injury-reducing effect of 90 % compared to an unrestrained child. Belt-positioning boosters from 4 to 10 years of age were found to have an injury reducing effect of 77 %. Compared to adults, this study indicates that children have a generally lower AIS 2 + injury rate, except for abdominal and lower-extremity injuries. Abdominal injuries are mainly found in children using only a seat belt, emphasizing the need for belt-positioning boosters. A tendency of higher injury risk was found when the growing child switches from one restraint to another, i. e. when the child is at the youngest age approved for the restraint. Thus, the total injury-reducing effect would increase if all children were to use the <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> most appropriate for their size and age.

CRS must be approved according to UN-ECE Regulation No. 44. The regulation classifies CRS in 5 body weight categories. The upper weight group is approved for children from 22 to 36 kg. However, studies show that already today many children weigh more than 36 kg although they have not reached a size of 150 cm. Therefore, no ECE R 44 approved CRS is available for these "overweight " children. In conclusion, today’s sizes and weights of children are no longer represented by the current version of the ECE R 44. The heaviest used dummy (P 10) weighs just 32. 6 kg and has a body height of 137. 9 cm. Statistical data of German children show that already 5 % of the children at a size of 137. 9 cm have a body weight above 45. 3 kg.

However, care {{needs to be taken}} to ensure that the mix of existing Australian <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> and any proposed lower anchorage system does not pose safety risks for children. In addition, it is desirable to avoid unique requirements for an Australian lower anchorage system and hence an assessment of UNECE ISOFIX and US FMVSS LATCH requirements was undertaken. A series of 28 frontal impact sled tests were conducted based on the Australian Standard AS/NZS 3629 <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> dynamic test method. A further series of 15 tests were conducted in a vehicle body mounted on an impact sled with an acceleration-time history representative of a 56 km/h full frontal rigid barrier crash. Three different models of forward-facing <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> were tested, with varying anchorage configurations including rigid ISOFIX, flexible LATCH strap and 3 -point seatbelt. Top tethers were evaluated with anchorages directly behind the <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> (0 °) and offset at an angle of 20 °. P 3 and Hybrid III 3 year old dummies were used. Anchorage loads and safety performance of the <b>restraint</b> <b>system</b> were assessed. In tests in the vehicle body, maximum dynamic top tether loads were in the range of 7 - 8 kN and maximum dynamic lower anchorage loads are estimated to be in the range 13 - 14 kN. Tests using rigid ISOFIX anchorages generally produced lower head acceleration and forward excursion than other tested anchorage types. However, this was accompanied by increased chest deflections and neck flexion moments. These data suggest that lower anchorage systems may be acceptable in Australia, but that modifications to the UNECE and LATCH requirements may be required to ensure compatibility with existing Australian <b>child</b> <b>restraint</b> <b>systems</b> without a degradation of child safety...|$|R
