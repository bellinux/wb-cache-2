5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} way, without taking his pencil from the paper or <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, {{and the next year}} sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.|$|E
500|$|The Season 2 episode [...] "Los Moscos" [...] has Management urge Ben to seek Scudder; Ben {{needs to}} learn {{the name of the}} preacher of his dreams (Brother Justin) to prevent a future catastrophe. An induced vision {{transports}} Ben into a desert where he suddenly hears an alarm-like noise. A massive explosion occurs, followed by a rising mushroom cloud. When Ben opens <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> blast of dust, Justin kneels {{in front of him and}} asks [...] "Ye offspring of serpents, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?" [...] Ben drives past this location one episode later in [...] "Alamogordo, NM". In a shared vision in the episode [...] "Creed, OK", Ben and Sofie kiss in a desert, surrounded by bright light and swirling dust. Season 2 takes place in 1935.|$|E
500|$|Six runs {{after the}} fall of Washbrook, the {{diminutive}} Emmett fended a rising ball from Lindwall to Sid Barnes at short leg, leaving England 28/2. Surprised by Lindwall's bouncer, Emmett took <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ball and fended with one hand on the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett's bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia's match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not deliver any more bouncers to Emmett during the match, and O'Reilly thought the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent's weakness against the short ball. O'Reilly concluded that Australia's pace duo [...] "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".|$|E

500|$|When {{the teams}} reconvened at Old Trafford for the Third Test, Hutton had been dropped, {{sparking}} much acrimony and {{controversy in the}} English cricket community. The reason {{was said to be}} Hutton's difficulties against Lindwall's short-pitched bowling. Observers noticed Hutton backing away, and the English selectors believed such a sight would {{have a negative effect on}} the rest of the side as it was a poor example from a key player. The Australians were pleased and believed the England selectors had erred, because they regarded Hutton as the hosts' best batsman. England batted first and Lindwall removed Hutton’s replacement as opener, George Emmett, who fended a short ball to Sid Barnes at short leg to leave England at 2/28. Emmett had been surprised by Lindwall's bouncer and took <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ball, fending with one hand on the bat, while ducking his head below his arms. The ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett’s bat, rebounded gently up in the air for Barnes to collect. In Australia’s match against Gloucestershire immediately preceding the Test, Lindwall bowled a bouncer to Emmett, who hesitantly parried it away for a single. Lindwall did not bounce Emmett again during the match, and O’Reilly surmised that the paceman was quietly waiting until the Tests to expose his opponent’s weakness against the short ball. O’Reilly concluded that Lindwall and Johnston [...] "had again disposed of the English opening batsmen with the minimum amount of effort".|$|E
500|$|The teams {{reassembled}} at Old Trafford for the Third Test. Australia dropped Brown, who {{had scored}} 73 runs at 24.33 in three Test innings in his unfamiliar {{position in the}} middle order. Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, and England made 363. Barnes caught his first victim for the Test series, the diminutive debutant opener George Emmett, who was surprised by a rising ball from Ray Lindwall. Emmett took <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ball and fended {{with one hand on}} the horizontally-held bat, while ducking his head down below his arms; the ball bounced slowly off the pitch and after hitting Emmett’s bat, rebounded gently up in the air to Barnes, leaving England at 2/28. Barnes dropped two catches later in the day, but neither cost Australia substantially. Jack Crapp hit Ernie Toshack to Barnes at short leg, who failed to hold the catch. However, Crapp did not capitalise and was out soon after. During the same middle session, Yardley hit Toshack to Barnes, who was again unable to complete the reflex catch. However, Yardley was dismissed shortly after for 22. Tail-ender Dick Pollard came to the crease on the second morning and pulled a ball from Ian Johnson into the left ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg, almost {{on the edge of the}} cut strip. According to Fingleton, Barnes [...] "dropped like a fallen tree", and a minority of spectators loudly celebrated the injury. Briefly paralysed on his left side, he had to be carried from the ground by four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1899, Maldonado was {{involved}} in a fight in the City of Ponce and was arrested. His men tried in vain to liberate him and the incident erupted into an armed confrontation between Maldonado's men and the local authorities in which Maldonado lost the sight from one of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wounds received. [...] Maldonado received support from the local press and was exonerated from all wrongdoing. He later married Juana Estrada and became a professional barber. According to his granddaughter Margarita Maldonado Colón, Maldonado was a generous man with the less fortunate and he was often visited {{by the president of the}} Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, Pedro Albizu Campos.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Eleazar {{interpreted}} the words [...] "He withdraws not <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> righteous" [...] in [...] to teach that God rewards righteousness, even generations later. The Gemara taught that in reward for Rachel's modesty {{as shown in}} her dealings with Jacob, God rewarded her with King Saul as a descendant. The Gemara taught that Jacob asked Rachel, [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, but {{my father is a}} trickster, and he will outwit you." [...] Jacob replied, [...] "I am his brother in trickery." [...] She said to him, [...] "Is it permitted to the righteous to indulge in trickery?" [...] He replied, [...] "Yes, with the pure you show yourself pure, and with the crooked you show yourself subtle." [...] He asked her, [...] "What is his trickery?" [...] She replied: [...] "I have a sister older than I am, and he will not let me marry before her." [...] So Jacob gave her certain tokens through which he could identify her. When night came, she said to herself, [...] "Now my sister will be put to shame," [...] so she gave Leah the tokens. Thus when [...] reports, [...] "And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah," [...] we are not to infer that up until then she had not been Leah, but rather that on account of the tokens that Rachel had given Leah, Jacob did not know until then that it was Leah. Therefore, God rewarded Rachel with having Saul among her descendants..|$|E
