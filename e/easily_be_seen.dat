5|$|Edward built further luxurious, {{self-contained}} lodgings for {{his court}} around {{the east and}} south edges of the Upper Ward, creating the modern shape of the quadrangle. The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward. In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside. The earliest weight-driven mechanical clock in England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354. William of Wykeham went on to build New College, Oxford and Winchester College, where the influence of Windsor Castle can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started {{to dry up}} about 10,000 years ago as the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E

5|$|Marking {{the heart}} of the serpent is the constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Serpentis. Traditionally called Unukalhai, is a red giant of spectral type K2III located approximately 23 parsecs distant with a visual magnitude of 2.630 ± 0.009, meaning it can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> with the naked eye even in areas with substantial light pollution. A faint companion is in orbit around the red giant star, although it is not visible to the naked eye. Situated near Alpha is Lambda Serpentis, a magnitude 4.42 ± 0.05 star rather similar to the Sun positioned only 12 parsecs away. Another solar analog in Serpens is the primary of Psi Serpentis, a binary star located slightly further away at approximately 14 parsecs.|$|E

A typical advantage of ATG is best felt when using a weapon sight which experiences a flame burst during shooting (see figures below showing pictures {{taken at the}} impact zone of a dropped bomb). ATG would reduce the temporary blindness that a standard BSP tube would introduce, allowing them to continuously maintain “eyes on target”.|$|E

25|$|Orion's seven {{brightest}} stars form a distinctive hourglass-shaped asterism, or pattern, {{in the night}} sky. Four stars—Rigel, Betelgeuse, Bellatrix and Saiph—form a large roughly rectangular shape, in the centre of which lie the three stars of Orion's Belt—Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka. Coincidentally, these seven stars {{are among the most}} distant that can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> with the naked eye. Descending from the 'belt' is a smaller line of three stars (the middle of which is in fact not a star but the Orion Nebula), known as the hunter's 'sword'.|$|E
25|$|Years {{after the}} war, {{memories}} faded {{and in the}} public mind it became popular to assume that the few pillboxes and other concrete objects that could <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> were all that was done to defend Britain; that their purpose was just to bolster morale and that {{there would have been no}} realistic hope of resisting a German assault. Even the Home Guard came to be seen as something of a joke, as exemplified by the BBC sitcom Dad's Army. However, what can be seen today are just the most visible and robust remains of a massive programme of fortification undertaken in a very short period.|$|E

Building One, the {{clothing}} section, is expanded by vendors who also sell clothes.

Stalls change merchandise frequently and currents modes of fashion can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from these stalls. One example was the proliferation of Indian style clothing which was popular in the mid 2000s in the city. There are also vendors selling other things related to fashion, such as henna tattoos and custom fingernail work.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} the German {{artillery}} behind the Gheluvelt Plateau after 31 July was undiminished and a continuous bombardment fell {{on the front line}} and rear areas of II Corps. The counter-battery artillery of the Fifth Army fired on German artillery positions along the width of the army front, ready for the general attack due after the II Corps operation on the Gheluvelt Plateau. The British guns often bombarded the wrong artillery positions {{because of a lack of}} air reconnaissance to track the moves of German artillery from one artillery position to another in the bad weather. The British failed to achieve artillery superiority over the German artillery behind the plateau, which made the completion of new battery positions a long and costly effort that took until 8 August. Casualties in men and guns were so high that on 4 August, many British batteries were reduced to half strength. The state of the ground was so bad that gunners had to live in shell holes. New plank roads to carry ammunition forward could <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> by German artillery observers and wagon drivers and carrying parties moved only at night, dodging German bombardments which frequently included mustard gas. Amidst the rain and mud, the delivery of supplies and the passage of troops across the beaten zone extremely dangerous and caused a constant drain of casualties.|$|E

He proposed that the shoreline artillery should be pulled back some [...] to [...] "retired batteries" [...] situated higher up the hill, equipped with the latest and most powerful guns and firing from barbettes rather than through embrasures. Such positions could not <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> from the sea, were out of the effective range of enemy ships and could not be flanked by landward guns. The sea wall would be defended solely by musket fire with the artillery support being provided from the bastions and retired batteries.|$|E
