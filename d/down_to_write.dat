5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E
25|$|Years later, when I sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> Tropic of Fear, a {{political}} thriller set in South America, I thought of those experiences.

She said after her first year of writing: [...] "I'm a private person and never thought that I could express my feelings. But strangely enough, {{whenever}} I sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> this column, my inner most thoughts came to the fore." [...] In March 2009, she met several readers who had submitted feedback on her weekly column.|$|E

500|$|In June 1659 Robinson and Stephenson {{were once}} again apprehended and {{brought back to the}} Boston jail. [...] When Dyer heard of these arrests, she once again left her home in Newport, and {{returned}} to Boston to support her Quaker brethren, ignoring her order of banishment, and once again being incarcerated. [...] Her husband had already come to Boston two years earlier to retrieve her from the authorities, signing an oath that she wouldn't return. [...] He wouldn't come back to Boston again, but on 30 August 1659 he did sit <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a long and impassioned letter to the magistrates, questioning the legality of the actions taken by the Massachusetts authorities.|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz {{said of the}} episode's origins, [...] "We've {{destroyed}} all {{the stuff}} about Mulder's father, the project, and the Syndicate. All the things that had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone. We had no crutches. From that point on, every time we sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a mythology show, {{we knew it was}} going to be a completely different challenge." [...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to get us to '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Shave Magazine, Ben Gibbard commented on his song writing saying that he [...] "never sit <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> an album number one. I just kind of sit down and write songs and the theme kind of makes itself apparent. But I would never say I was writing about searching for something as much as just trying to document with every song where I am in that moment when I’m writing that song. If a theme kind of makes itself apparent in a record, it {{has more to do}} with the fact that just what’s been on my mind recently. So I guess clearly I have been and was and am, but it was never a conscious decision." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{the fall}} of Saigon in 1975, Havan worked in defense sales as the Southeast Asia {{consultant}} for the Office General de l'Air (OGA), {{a branch of the}} French Defense Ministry that focused on the promotion of French military equipment.

50|$|Paul {{began writing}} as a teen. She and three or four friends would write during the week and share their stories at a Friday night slumber party. She took the Institute of Children’s Literature {{correspondence}} course when her children were preschoolers, and she later wrote a romance novel for her thirteen-year-old daughter, but she didn’t settle <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> until she got an infection in her leg that ultimately ended her school-teaching career.|$|R
50|$|Simultaneously, during Bregović's {{temporary}} army leaves, the duo, {{backed up}} by Bijelo Dugme singer Željko Bebek, initiated many discussions as they wanted things inside the band to be handled differently going forward. Most of the issues they brought up boiled <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> credits and subsequent revenue sharing. Dissatisfied with Bregović's flat rejection of their demands, the two abandoned Bijelo Dugme altogether in late July 1978 in order to fully commit to their new project.|$|R
500|$|Brooks {{discussed}} the cultural {{influences on the}} novel. He claimed inspiration from [...] (1984) by Studs Terkel, stating: [...] " [...] an oral history of World War II. I read it when I was a teenager and it's sat with me ever since. When I sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, I {{wanted it to be}} in the vein of an oral history." [...] Brooks also cited renowned zombie film director George A. Romero as an influence and criticized the Return of the Living Dead films: [...] "They cheapen zombies, make them silly and campy. They've done for the living dead what the old Batman TV show did for the Dark Knight." [...] Brooks acknowledged making several references to popular culture in the novel, including one to alien robot franchise Transformers, but declined to identify the others so that readers could discover them independently.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Neil Gaiman. After Steven Moffat {{replaced}} Russell T Davies as the showrunner of Doctor Who, being a fan of Gaiman's blog, Moffat met with Gaiman and Gaiman had asked to write an episode. In an interview Gaiman stated [...] "I came {{up with something that}} {{was one of those things}} where you thought that nobody's done that before." [...] The episode was originally titled [...] "The House of Nothing" [...] before Gaiman sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> it, but that was changed to [...] "Bigger on the Inside". This title remained until about six weeks before the episode aired, but the crew was beginning to worry that [...] "Bigger on the Inside" [...] would give away the surprise that Idris was the TARDIS, so it was changed. [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] was also a fake title attached to the 1984 serial The Caves of Androzani; then-producer John Nathan-Turner had changed the title to that on his planning board in an attempt to weed out a suspected leak in his office.|$|E
500|$|After the 53rd Grammy Awards, held in February 2011, {{band members}} Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood {{said in a}} {{backstage}} interview that work on the group's third album was almost complete. On May 2, 2011, the band [...] digitally released [...] "Just a Kiss", the lead single from the new project. In a blog entry on their website, the group said that [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] was among the last songs that were written for the album. Haywood commented, [...] "We were about six songs into recording and someone had this idea, so we sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> it." [...] Hillary Scott, Kelley and Haywood wrote the song with Dallas Davidson. Davidson discussed the conception of the song with country music blog Taste of Country: [...] "I {{went out on the}} road with them, and we wrote a couple of things. We recorded one song called 'We Own the Night'. Charles called me as they were about done with the record. He said, 'Man, we want to write again.' So the band came over [...] one morning. We started writing this other song. We were trying to find Hillary a little uptempo girl song. We wrote this cool thing." ...|$|E

6000|$|Fortunately for {{everybody}} who reads, London interested and stimulated Mr. Kipling, and he settled <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>writing.</b> [...] "The Record of Badalia Herodsfoot," [...] {{and his first}} novel, [...] "The Light that Failed," [...] appeared in 1890 and 1891; then a collection of verse, [...] "Life's Handicap, being stories of Mine Own People," [...] was published simultaneously in London and New York City; then followed more verse, and so on through an unending series.|$|R

2500|$|Heap {{states that}} her song lyrics come from {{personal}} experience, {{but are not}} straightforwardly confessional. She has stated [...] "Most of the time, the lyrics are kind of like my secret messages to my friends or my boyfriend or my mum or my dad. I would never tell them that these songs are about them or which specific lyric is about somebody. Often, when I sit <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> a lyric, {{it is in the}} heat of the moment, and something has just happened." ...|$|E
2500|$|Enigk confessed in an {{interview}} in December 2008 that because the band had already broken up during the recording of LP2, he and Hoerner never sat down to complete the lyrics; [...] "We broke up and we just felt like we were done. We put no energy into the artwork or into anything. On a lot of songs, there aren’t lyrics! In a lot of cases, we never sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> them, because we just wanted {{to get it out of}} the way as fast as possible. So I just sang a lot of gibberish, which makes it really quirky. My favorite is the Japanese translations".|$|E
50|$|By 1932 Massingham began <b>to</b> <b>write</b> {{more and}} more on country life, and the first of a long series of such books, {{possibly}} his best-known, was Wold Without End (1932), reflecting his experiences living in Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds. A serious accident happened in 1937, when he injured his leg, leading to a two-year period of regular hospital visits, {{at the end of which}} he hurt the same leg again, and it had to be amputated. He was forced to stop travelling as frequently as he had been doing and settled <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>writing</b> some thirty more books.|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} recorded in Jamaica where True, a porn star, had been appearing {{in a television}} commercial.

2500|$|Wray wrote {{three of}} the {{collection}} films celebrated in Martin Scorsese’s 2007 documentary film , two of them groundbreaking screenplays that helped define the genre of the psychological thriller and establish Lewton's reputation as the master of horror. [...] In Wray, Lewton found a writer with a gift for character development who was also {{willing to take on}} challenging or controversial subject matter: the supernatural, a serial killer, the plagues of war and superstition, and the relationships in the notorious Borgia family -- all were out of the mainstream when Wray sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> about them. [...] Her ability to seduce 1940's audiences into following Lewton down a path to some of the darker corners of human experience was evident in the unexpected critical and box office success of those films.|$|E
2500|$|Armageddon was {{originally}} slated for release mid-2012, {{but it was}} delayed because Sebastian wanted to be completely happy with it before it was released. He said, [...] "It's the longest I have spent with an album but I'm not rushing it for a TV performance or anything. It will happen when it's ready". He explained he had approached Armageddon {{in a different way}} than his previous albums, [...] "I haven't sat <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> an album, I've just been writing whatever I feel. I'm still learning what defines me as an artist. There's stuff in there that radio won't touch but it needs to be there and I think it lifts the album. [...] I've done most of it myself and I've really taken my time." [...] While the album has the upbeat happy music and love songs he is known for, Sebastian said becoming a father earlier in the year brought new awareness, and he started analysing the world his son would grow up in. He explained it gave him a broader perspective, and while he had always taken notice of the state of world affairs, he had never written about it in song before. Because of this he said the album has more light and shade, [...] "there's definitely moments where it has a bit more depth to it -- it's not just 'I love you, do you love me too?' Obviously there's some love songs in there, but there's also a bit more commentary on the world that my little boy (Hudson) is going to inherit." [...] When asked to give five words that could describe the album Sebastian used the words [...] "dark", [...] "reflective", [...] "happy", [...] "appreciative" [...] and [...] "anxious".|$|E
