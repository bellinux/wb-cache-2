5|$|On 10 December 2011, O'Gara became {{only the}} second player, the first being his Munster {{colleague}} John Hayes, to win 100 caps in the Heineken Cup. He achieved the feat in Munster's third pool game, away to Scarlets, which Munster won 14–17, with O'Gara contributing 12 points with his boot. The following week, O'Gara scored 14 points in the home tie against Scarlets, helping Munster to a 19-13 victory. He became the most capped Heineken Cup player <b>ever</b> <b>on</b> 14 January 2012, when Munster played Castres in Round 5 of the 2011–12 Heineken Cup, scoring 16 points along the way in a 26-10 win for Munster. In Munster's final pool game against Northampton Saints, O'Gara scored 24 points as Munster won 51-36.

As a result, O'Gara missed Munster's bonus-point victory against Edinburgh in Round 2, but he returned and scored 15 points in Munster's next pool game against Saracens, which saw Munster scrape a win. He became Munster's most capped player <b>ever</b> <b>on</b> 5 January 2013, when he won his 233rd cap against Cardiff Blues. O'Gara was cited and banned for one week after kicking Edinburgh's Sean Cox in the Heineken Cup Round 4 fixture between the two sides, which ruled him out of Munsters 29-6 victory over Racing Metro which secured qualification from the group stages. He kicked all of Munster's points in their 12-18 Heineken Cup quarter-final victory over Harlequins on 7 April 2013. O'Gara kicked five points for Munster in their 16-10 Heineken Cup semi-final defeat to Clermont Auvergne on 27 April 2013.|$|E

5|$|The Bills struck back quickly. On {{the first}} play of the fourth quarter, Thurman Thomas ran for a 31-yard {{touchdown}} that put the Bills back in front, 19–17. A few possessions later, the Giants drove down to the Bills' 4-yard line but {{had to settle for}} a 21-yard field goal by Matt Bahr that gave the Giants a 20–19 lead. Both teams exchanged possessions before the Bills began one final drive. The Bills drove down to the Giants' 30-yard line to set up a game-winning 47-yard field goal attempt by Scott Norwood. Just before the kick, ABC showed a graphic indicating that, on grass that season, Norwood had only made three of seven field goals from at least 40yards, and that the 47-yarder would be Norwood's longest <b>ever</b> <b>on</b> grass. A few moments later, in what became the game's signature moment, Norwood's attempt missed wide right, and the Giants won their second Super Bowl in five years, 20–19.|$|E
5|$|The {{intensification}} trend {{picked up}} {{again the next}} day with a fairly rapid drop in the storm's central pressure as it entered the southeastern Caribbean Sea, a region typically unfavorable for intensification. Hurricane Emily's winds increased in reaction, briefly bringing the storm to Category 4 strength early on July15. During the day, the storm's strength fluctuated greatly, dropping to a Category2 storm and then rebuilding to Category4. On July16, Emily strengthened considerably, making it the strongest hurricane <b>ever</b> <b>on</b> record to form in the month of July with peak winds of 160mph (260km/h), the earliest known Category 5 in the Atlantic basin. Initially at this point Emily was thought to have peaked as a Category4 storm, but the post-storm analysis showed it was indeed a Category5 hurricane. The storm weakened slightly as it continued westward, and remained a Category4 while passing south of Jamaica and, on July17, the Cayman Islands. Hurricane Emily continued on its nearly straight track to the west-northwest, weakening somewhat but remaining at Category4 until striking Cozumel just before mainland landfall at Playa del Carmen at 06:30UTC on July18. Sustained winds were 135mph (215km/h), and the eyewall passed directly over Cozumel.|$|E
5|$|Veronica asks Beaver {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and Beaver {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver pushes a button, and there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where we learn that Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she {{had to go back to}} New York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not <b>ever</b> <b>on</b> the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E
