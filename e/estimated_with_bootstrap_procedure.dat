40|$|Many {{researchers}} {{have studied the}} prevalence and content of men's aggressive sexual fantasies, including their link with rape-supportive cognition. However, little to no research has examined the link between imaginal ability {{and the use of}} such fantasies. Based on existing research and theory, we propose that men who hold hostile beliefs towards women will use aggressive sexual fantasies more often if they possess a greater ability to engage in a ‘rich fantasy life’. Operationally, we argue this involves: (1) a proneness to fantasize in general; (2) an ability to vividly envision mental imagery; and (3) frequent experiences of dissociation. To test this, the present study hypothesized that a latent variable termed ‘Rich Fantasy Life’, via ‘Hostile Beliefs about Women’, influences the use of ‘Aggressive Sexual Fantasies’. A sample of 159 community males was recruited. Each participant completed a measure of fantasy proneness, dissociation, and vividness of mental imagery, along with two measures that assess hostile beliefs about women. Assessing how often the participants fantasized about rape-related and sadistic themes provided a measure of aggressive sexual fantasies. Structural equation modeling (along <b>with</b> <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>procedures)</b> indicated that the data had a very good fit with the hypothesized model. The results offer an important contribution to our understanding of aggressive sexual fantasies, which may have implications for clinical assessment and treatment.

Data were collected before the campaign and monthly for 16 months during the campaign through cross-sectional telephone surveys among a sample of 3, 277 adult Philadelphia smokers. Follow-up interviews were conducted among 877 participants 3 months after their first survey. Cross-sectional and longitudinal mediation models <b>with</b> <b>bootstrap</b> <b>procedures</b> assessed the indirect effects of campaign exposure on outcomes through conversations, and the indirect effects of conversations about ads on outcomes through conversations about quitting. In addition, lagged regression analyses tested the causal direction of associations between the variables of interest. The results partially support hypotheses that conversations about quitting mediate campaign effects on quitting-related behaviors and, in line with previous research, that conversations about the ads have indirect effects on quitting-related behaviors by triggering conversations about quitting.

Path analyses <b>with</b> <b>bootstrapping</b> <b>procedures</b> were used to model direct and indirect effects of trait and social cognition constructs on physical activity through two distinct frameworks – the Theory of Planned Behavior and Neo-Socioanalytic Theory. While both models showed good internal fit, comparative model information criteria showed the Theory-of-Planned-Behavior-informed model provided a better fit. In the model, social cognitions fully mediated the relationships from the activity facet and industriousness to intentions for and engagement in physical activity, such that the relationships were primarily maintained by positive affective evaluations, positive expected outcomes, and confidence in overcoming barriers related to physical activity engagement. The resultant model – termed the Disposition-Belief-Motivation model – is proposed as a useful framework for organizing and integrating personality trait facets and social cognitions from various theoretical perspectives to investigate the expression of health-related behaviors, such as physical activity. Moreover, the results are discussed in terms of extending the application of the Disposition-Belief-Motivation model to longitudinal and intervention designs for physical activity engagement...|$|R
