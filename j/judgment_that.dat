5|$|At Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy grows {{jealous of}} Tyrion after his {{favorite}} prostitute Ros taunts {{him with the}} <b>judgment</b> <b>that</b> Tyrion is a better lover and from a richer family. Meanwhile, Bran is depressed over his paralysis {{and the fact that}} his mother left him while he was in a coma. To cheer him up, Maester Luwin decides to teach Bran the Dothraki art of horseback archery.|$|E
5|$|However, {{sometime}} later Jack learns the patient's husband {{is suing the}} hospital. Jack and Christian then attend a board meeting discussing what went wrong during the operation. The board reveals that the deceased woman was pregnant, which was unknown by Jack. Horrified, he confesses to the board that Christian was operating under the influence during the surgery, which impaired his <b>judgment</b> <b>that</b> led to the chain of events causing the woman's death.|$|E
5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or <b>judgment</b> <b>that</b> {{assists in}} {{distinguishing}} right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience {{is often described}} as leading to feelings of remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate through much of the history of Western philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{having taken}} Anne to France on a pre-nuptial honeymoon, Henry married her in Westminster Abbey in January 1533. This was made easier {{by the death}} of Archbishop Warham, a strong {{opponent}} of an annulment. Henry appointed Thomas Cranmer as his successor as Archbishop of Canterbury. Cranmer was prepared to grant the annulment of the marriage to Catherine as Henry required, {{going so far as to}} pronounce the <b>judgment</b> <b>that</b> Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God on 23 May. Anne gave birth to a daughter, Princess Elizabeth, in September 1533. The Pope responded to the marriage by excommunicating both Henry and Cranmer from the Roman Catholic Church (11 July 1533). Henry was excommunicated again in December 1538.|$|E
5|$|The {{discussion}} {{which has}} taken place here, and the consideration which {{has been given to}} the facts alleged, most conclusively show {{that this is not a}} case that can admit of no denial or proof to the contrary; under these circumstances, however obnoxious I am myself to the trial by battle, it is the mode of trial which we, in our judicial character, are bound to award. We are delivering the law as it is, and not as we wish it to be, and therefore we must pronounce our <b>judgment,</b> <b>that</b> the battle must take place.|$|E
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its <b>judgment</b> <b>that</b> the aims of Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E

25|$|The {{policies}} {{have been the subject}} of intense debate for more than seventy years among academics, politicians and diplomats.

50|$|<b>Judgments</b> <b>that</b> have as its matter true propositions can {{be called}} cognitions (§36). Cognitions are also {{dependent}} on the subject, and so, opposed to truths in themselves, cognitions do permit degrees; a proposition can {{be more or less}} known, but it cannot be more or less true. Every cognition implies necessarily a judgment, but not every judgment is necessarily cognition, because there are also <b>judgments</b> <b>that</b> are not true. Bolzano maintains that there are no such things as false cognitions, only false judgments (§34).|$|R
5000|$|... § 18. Judgments of {{experience}} are empirical <b>judgments</b> <b>that</b> are valid for external objects. They require special pure concepts which have {{originated in the}} pure understanding. All judging subjects will agree on their experience of the object. When a perception is subsumed under these pure concepts, it is changed into objective experience. On the other hand, all empirical <b>judgments</b> <b>that</b> are only valid for the one judging subject are judgments of mere perception. These judgments of perception are not subsumed under a pure concept of the understanding.|$|R

25|$|But in 1999, the Supreme Court of the HKSAR made a <b>judgment</b> <b>that</b> {{as long as}} {{the person}} is born in Hong Kong, they will be {{regarded}} as a permanent resident and will get the right of abode, even though their parents are not permanent residents of Hong Kong at the time they are born.|$|E

50|$|The writ is {{distinguished}} from other remedies primarily {{in terms of}} the timing of the grounds for objecting to the judgment, rather than the actual nature of the grounds, such as whether they are purely equitable. It may be further distinguished from the writ of coram nobis in that the latter is used to vacate a judgment, rather than the consequences of a judgment. Thus, audita querela may issue against <b>judgments</b> <b>that</b> were valid when rendered, while coram nobis would be used against <b>judgments</b> <b>that</b> were never valid.|$|R
40|$|One {{prominent}} {{argument for}} pragmatic encroachment (PE) is that PE is entailed {{by a combination}} of a principle that states that knowledge warrants proper practical reasoning, and <b>judgments</b> <b>that</b> it is more difficult to reason well when the stakes go up. I argue here that this argument is unsuccessful. One problem is that empirical tests concerning knowledge judgments in high-stakes situations only sometimes exhibit the result predicted by PE. I argue here <b>that</b> those <b>judgments</b> <b>that</b> appear to support PE are better interpreted not as <b>judgments</b> <b>that</b> the epistemic demands for knowing increase as one’s practical situation becomes more demanding, but instead as judgments reflecting a different kind of normative epistemic evaluation, namely whether one is acting in an epistemically responsible way. The general idea is that when someone treats a proposition as a reason for acting we can evaluate them epistemically both in terms of whether they know that proposition, as well as in terms of whether they are acting on their knowledge in the right kind of way. My charge against the PE proponent, then, is that she is interpreting <b>judgments</b> <b>that</b> are indicative of whether we are adhering to certain normative epistemic requirements generally as being indicative of whether we have knowledge specifically. There are, however, normative epistemic requirements that make demands of us that are indicative of something other than our possession of knowledge...|$|R

25|$|But, {{beginning}} in the 1950s and on through the 1970s, Heppenstahl began teaching that there were bigger issues involved in the pre-advent judgment than just humans. Heppenstahl’s protégés, Hans LaRondelle, Raoul Dederen and Morris Venden, through the 70s and 80s, taught {{an understanding of the}} purpose of the pre-advent <b>judgment</b> <b>that</b> includes humans, Satan, the entire universe, and even God Himself.|$|E
25|$|In 1899, the Court of Claims {{rendered}} a <b>judgment,</b> <b>that</b> {{only the}} Choctaw and Chicksaw {{were entitled to}} the payment for the surplus land. The Wichita appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which overturned the ruling. The Court of Claims awarded the Wichitas $673.371.91 ($1.25 an acre) for their surplus land. When Congress finally appropriated the funding in 1902, it deducted 43,332.93 from the total payment for attorney fees.|$|E
25|$|Associate Justice Jackson {{writes in}} his dissenting opinion that since the Court upheld the Alien Land Law, it could not logically set aside the <b>judgment</b> <b>that</b> {{resulted}} from its valid enforcement. He noted further that since it was accepted that California was permitted to forbid certain aliens from owning land, {{it should also be}} accepted that the state was empowered to modify its laws in order to preclude individuals from circumventing the relevant statutes.|$|E
