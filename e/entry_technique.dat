The top 32 drivers with the highest qualifying scores are entered in a competition bracket pairing the highest scoring drivers against the lowest scoring drivers. 1st v. 32nd, 2nd v. 31st, 3rd v. 30th, etc. The drivers are judged on line, speed, angle, and overall impact. The judges can also make additional request at the drivers meeting for actions or techniques that will weigh in their decision making (ex; <b>entry</b> <b>technique,</b> racing line, proximity, etc.). Formula D drivers are scored on a points-deduction system where every driver will start their judged run with a perfect score of 100 pts. For every mistake, points will be deducted. These points will vary between [...]25 point to the most severe mistakes (-1.75).|$|E

30|$|A {{major concern}} {{with regard to}} laparoscopic {{procedures}} during pregnancy is the initial insertion of the Veress needle and the first trocar. In contrast to general surgery [12], in gynaecology no official guidelines are available concerning the laparoscopic approach during pregnancy. General surgeons’ published {{data suggest that the}} open laparoscopic <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> is preferred in pregnancy so that entry-related complications may be avoided [12]. Although the closed <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> in gynaecology should not be abandoned [24], in the case of pregnancy we advocate the use of the open <b>entry</b> <b>technique.</b> Although our series do not give enough evidence to support the abandoning of the closed <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> in pregnancy, we have to bear in mind that an ovarian cyst, when located in the pouch of Douglas, can lift the uterus and increase the chance of injury by the sharp instruments. In addition, the risk of penetration of the adnexal mass during the closed <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> is possible, with the adverse effect of spillage of cystic content [25]. However, a closed <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> can be considered when the size of the pelvic mass is less than 12 weeks of gestation. In our series no entry-related complications for either <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> was experienced.|$|E
30|$|On {{theoretical}} grounds, {{the selection}} of a high-risk group of patients for an alternative entry instead of a closed-entry technique can still be recommended. At this time it seems that either <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> has its risks for complication. It is advisable to be familiar with more than one <b>entry</b> <b>technique.</b>|$|E

30|$|Randomised {{controlled}} {{trials were}} included when one laparoscopic <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> was compared with another.|$|E
30|$|In general, no {{completely}} safe <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> can be recommended. Specialists should preferably {{practice the}} technique {{they have learned}} and {{with which they are}} familiar. According to expert opinion, experience with a particular <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> will reduce the risks of complications. Exceptions to this rule are: patients with prior abdominal surgery, obese patients, very thin patients and pregnant patients (see key question 1.7).|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Trocar {{insertion}} injury {{has a high}} morbidity, mortality, and cost. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare standard trocar entry with our reduced-force closed trocar <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> by measuring trocar insertion force using a mechanical force gauge. Methods: In the operating room, the force gauge was inserted into a sterile glove and connected to the proximal portion of the trocar to measure insertion force. Through one incision, we used a standard closed trocar entry, while through the other incision, we used our reducedforce closed trocar <b>entry</b> <b>technique.</b> After making the skin incision and before trocar entry, we spread and dilated the skin, subcutaneous tissue, fascia, and muscle with a hemostat. Results: Twenty-five patients entered the trial and none were excluded. Median trocar insertion force was 3. 3 lb (range, 1. 6 to 5. 4) with our reduced-force trocar <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> versus 6. 5 lb (range, 2. 0 to 14. 0) with the standard trocar entry (P�. 001). No complications occurred with the reduced-force trocar <b>entry</b> <b>technique.</b> Conclusion: Our reduced-force trocar <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> decreases trocar insertion force by 50 %, requires no additional instruments or cost and is fast and safe. Reducedentry force pressure may decrease the risk of trocar insertion injury...|$|E

A total of forty-eight undergraduate students answered a set of sixteen items which were used to gather participants 2 ̆ 7 opinions on the three techniques.

30|$|The {{incidence}} of complications related to laparoscopy is low; however, {{they can be}} very severe. More than 50 % of laparoscopic complications are entry related and these occasionally require emergency surgery. Basically, two different <b>entry</b> <b>techniques</b> can be distinguished׃ the open- and closed-entry technique. Surgeons and urologists often use the open technique with Hasson trocar (also called the Hasson technique) [9] while gynecologists often use the closed technique with blind introduction of the Veress needle and primary trocar. The risks associated with the two different techniques are investigated and can be variously interpreted. The text below describes the strategies for a safe application of <b>entry</b> <b>techniques</b> in laparoscopy.|$|R
30|$|In {{the event}} of doubt or {{suspected}} periumbilical adhesions, the Veress needle and primary trocar should not be introduced at the umbilicus. An alternative technique (e.g., the open <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> or insufflation {{at the point of}} Palmer) should be chosen.|$|E
30|$|Closed trocar <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> was {{employed}} with carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum achieving a pressure of 15  mmHg. A twisted left ovarian cyst was noted. Laparoscopic cystectomy was performed successfully after untwisting the cyst. The time taken for {{the procedure was}} 45  min.|$|E
30|$|Conclusion: Laparoscopic <b>entry</b> <b>technique</b> {{should take}} into account this distance. Veress needle should be {{inserted}} vertically through the pit of umbilicus not deeper than these suggested depths to reduce the vascular injury. Marked veress needle will be helpful to guide the insertion.|$|E
