40|$|Abstract. Millions {{of people}} {{all around the world}} suffer from <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> known as {{anorexia}} nervosa, bulimia nervosa, pica, and others. When <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> coexist with other mental health <b>disorders,</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> often go undiagnosed and untreated; a low number of sufferers obtain treatment for the <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> Unfortunately, <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> have also the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, upwards of 20 %. This paper focuses on monitoring <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> of cognitive impaired people as patients with the Alzheimer’s disease. The proposed approach relies on the application of Ambient Intelligence (AmI) technologies and a new method for the detection of abnormal human behaviors in a con-trolled environment...|$|R
25|$|Weight loss is {{one such}} method. For instance, Mexican American {{women who have been}} attuned to {{mainstream}} US culture reported greater body dissatisfaction and have described their ideal body types to be similar to the white norm. In {{spite of the fact that}} certain ethnicities naturally have different body types, this ideal has led to <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> amongst Latinas.|$|E
25|$|Studies have {{hypothesized}} the continuance of <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> patterns may be epiphenomena of starvation. The {{results of}} the Minnesota Starvation Experiment showed normal controls exhibit many of the behavioral patterns of anorexia nervosa (AN) when subjected to starvation. This {{may be due to}} the numerous changes in the neuroendocrine system, which results in a self-perpetuating cycle.|$|E
25|$|Objectification theory {{suggests}} both {{direct and indirect}} consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include self consciousness in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this. Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment {{is one of the}} challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading. Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental health threats (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including <b>disordered</b> <b>eating,</b> mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, cosmetic surgery, etc. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.|$|E

500|$|Self-harm (SH), also {{referred}} to as self-injury (SI), self-inflicted violence (SIV), nonsuicidal self injury (NSSI) or self-injurious behaviour (SIB), refers to a spectrum of behaviours where demonstrable injury is self-inflicted. The behaviour involves deliberate tissue damage that is usually performed without suicidal intent. [...] The most common form of self-harm involves cutting of the skin using a sharp object, e. g. a knife or razor blade. The term self-mutilation is also sometimes used, although this phrase evokes connotations that some find worrisome, inaccurate, or offensive. Self-inflicted wounds is a specific term associated with soldiers to describe non-lethal injuries inflicted in order to obtain early dismissal from combat. This differs from the common definition of self-harm, as damage is inflicted for a specific secondary purpose. A broader definition of self-harm might also include those who inflict harm on their bodies by means of <b>disordered</b> <b>eating.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Eating {{disorders}} expert Margo D. Maine {{used the}} concept of [...] "father hunger" [...] in her book : Fathers, Daughters and Food (Nov 1991), with particular emphasis on {{the relationship with the}} daughter. Such father hunger, as prompted by paternal absence, may leave the daughter with an unhealthy kind of narcissism, and with a prevalent search for external sources of self-esteem. Maine further examined the longing that all children have for connection with fathers, and how an unmet father hunger influences <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> and other mental illnesses.|$|E
2500|$|The Female Athlete Triad is a {{condition}} among women that consists of three related health irregularities: <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> habits, irregular menstruation, and premature bone loss or osteoporosis. [...] The term was coined in the early 1990s when researchers from the National Institutes of Health noticed unusual health patterns among female athletes. [...] These researchers observed increases in eating habit disorders in young female athletes. Exercising intensely while getting inadequate nutrition can lead to amenorrhea - or irregular menstrual cycles - which in turn can lead to osteoporosis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{a variety}} of personality disorders in individuals with <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and also {{emphasizes the importance of}} identifying clinically meaningful <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> subtypes based on concurrent personality disorder. The relationship between personality <b>disorders</b> and <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> is an important issue as this association has implications for assessment and treatment. Different hypotheses concerning the relationship between personality <b>disorders</b> and <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> will be reviewed. The prevalence rates of concomitant personality <b>disorder</b> diagnoses in <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> patients is highlighted to illustrate some of the pertinent conceptual issues concerning the meaning of the co-occurrence of separately defined diagnostic entities. The literature review reveals a robust finding that patients with ersonality pathology have a poorer response to treatment of Axis I disorders than those without such pathology. It is also argued that therapeutic relationship deserves more attention in the assessment and treatment of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> patients with a co morbid personality disorder...|$|R

2500|$|According to an 80-year old {{and ongoing}} study started in 1921 by {{psychologist}} Lewis Terman on over 1,500 gifted adolescent Californians, [...] "The strongest predictor of long life was conscientiousness." [...] Specific behaviors associated with low conscientiousness may explain {{its influence on}} longevity. Nine different behaviors that are among the leading causes of mortality—alcohol use, <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> (including obesity), drug use, lack of exercise, risky sexual behavior, risky driving, tobacco use, suicide, and violence—are all predicted by low conscientiousness. Health behaviors are more strongly correlated with the conventionality rather than the impulse-control aspect of conscientiousness. Apparently, social norms influence many health-relevant behavior, such as healthy diet and exercise, not smoking and moderate drinking, and highly conscientious people adhere the most strongly to these norms. Additionally, conscientiousness is positively related to health behaviors such as regular visits to a doctor, checking smoke alarms, and adherence to medication regimens. Such behavior may better safeguard health and prevent disease.|$|E
2500|$|Bulimia nervosa can be {{difficult}} to detect, compared to anorexia nervosa, because bulimics tend to be of average or slightly above or below average weight. Many bulimics may also engage in significantly <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> and exercise patterns without meeting the full diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa. Recently, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was revised, which resulted in the loosening of criteria regarding the diagnoses of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. [...] The diagnostic criteria utilized by the DSM-5 includes repetitive episodes of binge eating (a discrete episode of overeating during which the individual feels out of control of consumption) compensated for by excessive or inappropriate measures taken to avoid gaining weight. The diagnosis also requires the episodes of compensatory behaviors and binge eating to happen a minimum of once a week for a consistent time period of 3 months. The diagnosis is made only when the behavior is {{not a part of the}} symptom complex of anorexia nervosa and when the behavior reflects an overemphasis on physical mass or appearance. Purging often is a common characteristic of a more severe case of bulimia nervosa.|$|E

40|$|The transdiagnostic {{approach}} to theory {{and treatment of}} psychological disorders is gaining increasing interest. A transdiagnostic process is one that occurs across disorders and explains their onset or maintenance. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence that perfectionism is a transdiagnostic process that it is elevated in anxiety <b>disorders,</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> depression, obsessive compulsive personality disorder and somatoform disorders. Data are also reviewed to show that perfectionism can explain aetiology {{as it is a}} prospective predictor of depression and <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> Perfectionism is also demonstrated to predict poorer outcome to treatment for anxiety <b>disorders,</b> <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> and depression, suggesting the need for specific treatment of perfectionism. Evidence is provided to demonstrate that perfectionism can be successfully treated with cognitive behavioural therapy which results in reduction in psychopathologies. Clinical guidelines are outlined to assist in treatment planning for individuals with elevated perfectionism...|$|R

50|$|Another study {{specifically}} investigated {{whether a}} parental's eating disorder could predict <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> in their children. It {{was found that}} rates of eating disorder appearances in children with either parent or the mother having a history of an eating disorder were much higher than those with parents without an eating disorder. Reported <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> peaked between ages 15 and 17 with the risk of eating disorder occurrences in females 12.7 times greater than of that in males. This is, “of particular interest {{as it has been}} shown that maternal ED disorders predict <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> behaviour in their daughters.” This suggests that poor eating habits result as a coping mechanism for other direct issues presented by an unstable home environment.|$|E
50|$|One study {{explored}} {{the connection between}} the <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> patterns of adolescents and the poor socio-emotional coping mechanisms of guardians with mental disorders. It was found that in homes of parents with mental health issues (such as depression or anxiety), the children living in these environments self-reported experiencing stressful home environments, parental withdrawal, rejection, unfulfilled emotional needs, or over-involvement from their guardians. It was hypothesized that this was directly related to adolescent study participants also reporting poor emotional awareness, expression, and regulation in relation to internalized/ externalized eating disordered habits. Parental anxiety/ depression could not be directly linked to <b>disordered</b> <b>eating,</b> but could be linked to the development of poor coping skills that can lead to <b>disordered</b> <b>eating</b> behaviors.|$|E
40|$|Eating disorders, {{which are}} {{associated}} with a host of adverse medical morbidities, negative psychological sequelae, and considerable reductions in quality of life, should be diagnosed and treated promptly.

40|$|Introduction: Eating {{disorders}} commonly affect {{young girls}} and women. Four <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> are analyzed in this study: anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> not otherwise speciﬁed (EDNOS), and binge <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> (BED). Eating disorders are a modern concept {{and as such}} there is no critically appraised research on how Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) conceptualizes of or treats <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify and quantify the TCM patterns relevant to <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> based on a systematic evaluation of the results of a self-reported questionnaire. Methods: One hundred and ninety-six (196) female participants (142 with a self-reported <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and 54 with no <b>eating</b> <b>disorder)</b> completed an online survey, designed to collect data on their current general health and, where relevant, their <b>eating</b> <b>disorder.</b> The Berle methodology was used to identify TCM patterns involved in <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> to tabulate and score the number of signs and symptoms experienced by the participants. Results: For many of the TCM patterns, statistically signiﬁcant differences were found between presentation severity across the four <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> Conclusions: For the ﬁrst time, there is evidence-based research to classify the TCM patterns involved in AN, BN, EDNOS, and BED. Evidence is given to support the anecdotal theories of TCM patterns involved in <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> presentation. These results have relevance on how <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> are treated and viewed by TCM practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Eating {{disorders}} are debilitating psychological illnesses for which sufferers often face stigmatisation. This stigma has consequences for wellbeing, treatment outcomes, and help-seeking. Men with <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> {{may be particularly}} vulnerable to stigmatisation. Relatively understudied, there is growing recognition that the “male experience” of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> {{is not confined to}} thinness-oriented eating problems, including anorexia nervosa, but also muscularity-oriented eating problems, namely, muscle dysmorphia. This thesis constitutes four peer-reviewed and published studies examining stigma toward males with <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> and <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> stigma more broadly. Two additional manuscripts, also published, provide context for the aforementioned studies, and are provided in this thesis. The core research of four studies examined a) stigmatising attitudes and beliefs about men and women with anorexia nervosa and muscle dysmorphia, b) the prevalence and adverse associations of stigmatisation among men and women with <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> c) the contribution of self-stigma of seeking treatment to rates of <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> diagnosis among male and female sufferers, and d) stigma resistance among men and women with <b>eating</b> <b>disorders.</b> Results showed that women with anorexia nervosa may be particularly susceptible to stigmatisation from males, that stigmatisation of males with anorexia nervosa and muscle dysmorphia may be strongly tied to perceptions of masculinity, that more frequent stigma among <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> sufferers is associated with a more severe <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> and longer duration of illness, that the key sex difference in stigmatisation as reported by <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> sufferers is that males report more frequently being stigmatised as “less of a man”, that the self-stigma of seeking psychological help is a stronger predictor of an <b>eating</b> <b>disorder</b> sufferer being undiagnosed if the sufferer is male compared to female, and that stigma resistance may offer some protection against the internalization of mental illness and <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> stigma. Taken together, these findings have considerably broadened our understanding of <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> stigma, particularly toward males. The findings should be used inform the development of early intervention and destigmatisation initiatives aimed at <b>eating</b> <b>disorders,</b> and offer promising directions for future research on <b>eating</b> <b>disorders</b> stigma...|$|R
