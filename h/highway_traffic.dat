5|$|The U.S. National <b>Highway</b> <b>Traffic</b> Safety Administration (NHTSA) is {{conducting}} a study due in 2014 to establish whether lithium-ion batteries in plug-electric vehicles pose a potential fire hazard. The research is looking at whether the high-voltage batteries can cause fires when they are being charged and when the vehicles are involved in an accident. Both General Motors and Nissan have published a guide for firefighters and first responders to properly handle a crashed plug-in electric-drive vehicle and safely disable its battery and other high voltage systems.|$|E

Controversies regarding the Volt include {{the extent to}} which the U.S. federal government may have participated in the Volt’s development, which continued through General Motors' 2009 government-led bankruptcy, and concerns about the battery pack fire risk following a crash test that the National <b>Highway</b> <b>Traffic</b> Safety Administration (NHTSA) performed on a Volt in 2011.

5|$|A bushfire burnt {{through the}} area in December 1993, {{destroying}} the former railway's bridge over Clackline Brook. Clackline Bridge survived, weakened but in a reasonable condition. The damage included internal expansion joints that had failed, split bedlogs, and other deteriorated timbers. Steel props were installed to support the bridge, and the substructure was repaired in 1995, which mainly involved replacing connecting bolts. A concrete approach slab was installed adjacent to the western abutment in 1998, and in 2013 the concrete deck near pier13 was repaired. Clackline Bridge was the crossing point for Great Eastern Highway until the highway's bypass of Clackline opened in February 2008. The bridge remains open to traffic, {{as part of the}} local road network. In July 2012 it once more carried <b>highway</b> <b>traffic,</b> excluding heavy vehicles, when an accident temporarily closed Great Eastern Highway at Spencers Brook Road.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National <b>Highway</b> <b>Traffic</b> Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{consideration}} of highway passenger transportation {{system is a}} Grey system of incomplete information; this paper constructs a Grey model and a cubic-exponential-smoothing model at first. In {{order to avoid the}} shortcomings of a single model, it constructs a cubic-exponential-smoothing combination model based on Grey system theory by using the optimal weighted principle. Compared with the single model, the prediction accuracy of the cubic-exponential-smoothing combination model is higher, and the predicted results are much more reliable. So it is better suitable for <b>highway</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> volume prediction. At last, this paper gives the prediction of the National <b>highway</b> passenger <b>traffic</b> volume in the first five months of 2014.
