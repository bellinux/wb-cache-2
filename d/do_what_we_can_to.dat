500|$|In {{conversation}} with Woods, Biko {{insisted that the}} BCM would not degenerate into anti-white racism [...] "because it isn't a negative, hating thing. It's a positive black self-confidence thing involving no hatred of anyone". He acknowledged that a [...] "fringe element" [...] may retain [...] "anti-white bitterness"; he added: [...] "we'll <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> restrain that, but frankly it's not one of our top priorities or one of our major concerns. Our main concern is the liberation of the blacks." [...] Elsewhere, Biko {{argued that it was}} the responsibility of a vanguard movement to ensure that, in a post-apartheid society, the black majority would not seek vengeance upon the white minority. He stated that this would require an education of the black population in order to teach them how to live in a non-racial society.|$|E

We are also called to serve, to share, to give and to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> lift up the lives of others. No other college emphasizes this challenge so strongly. That’s what makes Antioch so special." ...|$|E

2500|$|Peter Hitchens {{argued that}} Pullman pursues an anti-Christian agenda, citing an {{interview}} in which Pullman is quoted as saying: [...] "I'm trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief." [...] In the same interview, Pullman acknowledges that a controversy {{would be likely to}} boost sales, but continues [...] "I'm {{not in the business of}} offending people. I find the books upholding certain values that I think are important, such as life is immensely valuable and this world is an extraordinarily beautiful place. We should <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> increase the amount of wisdom in the world." [...] Hitchens also views the His Dark Materials series as a direct rebuttal of C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia; Pullman has criticised the Narnia books as religious propaganda. Hitchens' brother Christopher Hitchens, author of God Is Not Great, praised His Dark Materials as a fresh alternative to Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and J. K. Rowling, describing the author as one [...] "whose books have begun to dissolve the frontier between adult and juvenile fiction". However, he was more critical of The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ, accusing Pullman of being a [...] "Protestant atheist" [...] for supporting the teachings of Christ but being critical of organised religion.|$|E
