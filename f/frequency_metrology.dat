50|$|Optical spectroscopic {{techniques}} in general, and laser-based {{techniques in}} particular, {{have a great}} potential for detection and monitoring of constituents in gas phase. They combine {{a number of important}} properties, e.g. a high sensitivity and a high selectivity with non-intrusive and remote sensing capabilities. Laser absorption spectrometry has become the foremost used technique for quantitative assessments of atoms and molecules in gas phase. It is also a widely used technique for a variety of other applications, e.g. within the field of optical <b>frequency</b> <b>metrology</b> or in studies of light matter interactions. The most common technique is tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) which has become commercialized and is used for a variety of applications.|$|E
50|$|During {{the last}} decade, the {{development}} of supercontinua sources has emerged as an interesting and active research field. This {{is largely due to}} new technological developments, which have allowed more controlled and accessible generation of supercontinua. This renewed research has created a variety of new light sources which are finding applications in a diverse range of fields, including optical coherence tomography, <b>frequency</b> <b>metrology,</b> fluorescence lifetime imaging, optical communications, gas sensing and many others. The application of these sources has created a feedback loop whereby the scientists utilising the supercontinua are demanding better customisable continua to suit their particular applications. This has driven researchers to develop novel methods to produce these continua and to develop theories to understand their formation and aid future development. As a result, rapid {{progress has been made in}} developing these sources since 2000. While supercontinuum generation has for long been the preserve of fibers, in recent years, integrated waveguides have come of age to produce extremely broad spectra, opening the door to more economical, compact, robust, scalable and mass-producible supercontinuum sources.|$|E
50|$|Supercontinuum sources {{driven by}} ultrashort pump pulses (on {{the order of}} tens of femtoseconds in {{duration}} or less) are generally much more stable than those pumped by longer pulses. Even though such supercontinuum sources may make use of anomalous or zero dispersion, the propagation lengths are usually short enough that noise-seeded modulation instability has a less significant impact. The broadband nature of the input radiation makes it such that octave-spanning supercontinua can be achieved with relatively modest broadening factors. Even so, the noise dynamics of such sources can still be nontrivial, though they are generally stable and can be suitable for precision time-resolved measurements and <b>frequency</b> <b>metrology.</b> Nevertheless, soliton timing jitter in supercontinuum generation with 100 fs pulses has also been traced to input noise amplification by modulation instability, and L-shaped statistics in filtered energy have been observed in supercontinuum sources driven by such pulses. Extreme statistics have also been observed with pumping in the normal dispersion regime, wherein modulation instability occurs due the contribution of higher-order dispersion.|$|E

40|$|The next {{generation}} of atomic frequency standards based on an ensemble of neutral atoms or a single-ion will provide very stringent tests in metrology, applied and fundamental physics requiring a new step in very precise control of external systematic corrections. In {{the proceedings of the}} 8 th Symposium on <b>Frequency</b> Standards and <b>Metrology,</b> we present a generalization of the recent Hyper-Ramsey spectroscopy with separated oscillating fields using composites pulses in order to suppress field frequency shifts induced by the interrogation laser itself. Sequences of laser pulses including specific selection of phases, frequency detunings and durations are elaborated to generate spectroscopic signals with a strong reduction of the light-shift perturbation by off resonant states. New optical clocks based on weakly allowed or completely forbidden transitions in atoms, ions, molecules and nuclei will benefit from these generalized Ramsey schemes to reach relative accuracies well below the 10 $^{- 18 }$ level.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the late}} 1990 ’s mode-locked {{femtosecond}} lasers were introduced {{as an important}} new tool for the synthesis and measurement of optical frequencies. The simplicity, robustness and improved precision of femtosecond lasers has now led to their prominence {{in the field of}} optical <b>frequency</b> <b>metrology.</b> In addition, their use is developing significant new time-domain applications based on the precise control of the carrier-envelope phase. It is anticipated that narrow linewidth lasers referenced to optical transitions in atoms and ions will soon be the best electromagnetic frequency references of any kind, with projected fractional frequency instability below 1 × 10 - 15 τ- 1 / 2 and uncertainties approaching 1 × 10 - 18. When used in conjunction with such ultraprecise frequency standards, the femtosecond laser serves as a broadband synthesizer that phase-coherently converts the input optical frequency to an array of optical frequencies spanning hundreds of terahertz and to countable microwave frequencies. The excess fractional frequency noise introduced in the synthesis process can approach the level of 1 × 10 - 19.
