It is shown that to satisfy the AGK rules the vertex has to be fully symmetric in all four reggeized gluons which form the two final pomerons. The single inclusive cross-sections are found for different cuttings of the triple pomeron vertex. They sum into the expression obtained by Yu. Kovchegov and K. Tuchin in the colour dipole picture.

40|$|In many {{applications}} of the intranuclear-cascade (INC) model to spallation reactions, all nucleons in the target are assumed to move in a common potential well. However, the potential depth should depend upon nucleon isospin and energy. The present paper describes the first results obtained after the introduction of these features in the Liege INCL 3 model. It is shown that such modifications change cascade particle multiplicities significantly but total particle multiplicities are only slightly altered. Nucleon inclusive cross-sections are not modified significantly, except {{in the region of}} the quasi-elastic peaks. In particular, the centroid of the peak in neutron <b>double</b> differential <b>cross-sections</b> relative to proton-induced reactions can be sizeably shifted toward larger energy losses, as is observed experimentally.
