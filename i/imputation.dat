5|$|A key {{step in the}} {{majority}} of GWA studies is the <b>imputation</b> of genotypes at SNPs not on the genotype chip used in the study. This process greatly increases the number of SNPs that can be tested for association, increases the power of the study, and facilitates meta-analysis of GWAS across distinct cohorts. Genotype <b>imputation</b> is carried out by statistical methods that combine the GWAS data together with a reference panel of haplotypes. These methods take advantage of sharing of haplotypes between individuals over short stretches of sequence to impute alleles. Existing software packages for genotype <b>imputation</b> include IMPUTE2 and MaCH.|$|E
5|$|Church {{growth in}} the Northeast was also {{accompanied}} by revivalism. While calmer and more reserved {{than those in the}} South, the revivals of the Second Great Awakening transformed religion in the Northeast, and they were often led by Presbyterians and Congregationalists. The Plan of Union led to the spread of New England theology (also known as the New Divinity and New Haven theology), originally conceived by Congregationalists. The New England theology modified and softened traditional Calvinism, rejecting the doctrine of <b>imputation</b> of Adam's sin, adopting the governmental theory of atonement, and embracing a greater emphasis on free will. It was essentially an attempt to construct a Calvinism conducive to revivalism. While the Synod of Philadelphia condemned the New Divinity as heretical in 1816, the General Assembly disagreed, concluding that New England theology did not conflict with the Westminster Confession.|$|E

25|$|Australia and New Zealand have a {{dividend}} <b>imputation</b> system, wherein companies can attach franking credits or <b>imputation</b> credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax {{paid by the}} company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company tax paid generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 - company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders {{who are able to}} use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.|$|E

30|$|An {{alternative}} treatment for missing data, {{which we could}} have implemented as a fourth scaling approach, {{would have been to}} use <b>imputations</b> as a means of replacing missing information with “pseudo-information.” However, <b>imputations</b> for missing data are model-dependent draws from the posterior distribution of random variables, conditional on the observed values of other available variables, and requiring use of estimated relationships between the variable that is missing and the remainder of the variables. In order to account for the uncertainty associated with these <b>imputations,</b> we would need to have multiple sets of data, a requirement that would increase the operational burden by a multiplier equal to the number of <b>imputations</b> (often 5).

25|$|Previously, some economists, such as Carl Menger {{and others}} of the Austrian School, {{maintained}} {{that the value of}} factors of production is the individual contribution of each in the final product, but its value is the value of the last contributed to the final product (the marginal utility before reaching the point Pareto optimal). Thus, Wieser identified a flaw in the theory of <b>imputation</b> as expounded by his teacher, Carl Menger: overvaluation may occur if one is confronted with economies where profits jump (maximums and minimums in his utility function, where its second derivative equals 0). Wieser thus suggested as an alternative the simultaneous solution of a system of industrial equations.|$|E

Later, Paul Fry argued against McGann's stance when he pointed out, [...] "It scarcely seems pertinent to say that 'To Autumn' is therefore an evasion of social violence when it is so clearly an encounter with death itself [...] {{it is not a}} politically encoded escape from history reflecting the coerced betrayal [...] of its author's radicalism.

500|$|Weber, {{like his}} {{colleague}} Werner Sombart, regarded economic calculation {{and especially the}} double-entry bookkeeping method of business accounting, {{as one of the}} most important forms of rationalisation associated with the development of modern capitalism. Weber's preoccupation with the importance of economic calculation led him to develop a critique of socialism as a system that lacked a mechanism for allocating resources efficiently in order to satisfy human needs. Socialist intellectuals like Otto Neurath had realised that in a completely socialised economy, prices would not exist and central planners would have to resort to in-kind (rather than monetary) economic calculation. According to Weber, this type of coordination would be inefficient, especially because it would be incapable of solving the problem of <b>imputation</b> (i.e. of accurately determining the relative values of capital goods).

When he returned to Washington for the lame-duck session of the Senate beginning in December, Borah pressed the passage of legislation that would help business and suggested that members of Congress turn back their salary to the Treasury. The economy continued to worsen in the winter of 1931, and Borah urged relief legislation, stating that opponents argued [...] "that for the Government to feed this woman and her sick children would destroy her self respect and make a bad citizen of her.

[...] These concerns were communicated to Carmichael-Smyth, who decided that the parade would go ahead as planned; during the night, Carmichael-Smyth's tent and some buildings were destroyed by fire. The following morning, 90 men, the regiment's carabiniers or skirmishers, were lined up to carry out the new parade drill using blank ammunition. When Carmichael-Smyth arrived at the parade ground, he found that no man had taken their ammunition, and he ordered the Havildar Major to carry out the drill. There was then an attempt to distribute the cartridges {{to the rest of the}} carabiniers but this was refused, despite a speech from Carmichael-Smyth reminding the men that the cartridges were the type they had been using for years.
