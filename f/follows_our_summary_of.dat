The aim {{of this study is to}} create scenarios on how new information systems for improved road traffic can evolve. What are the driving forces? Who can act? Who can benefit?

40|$|Background: Ganciclovir, a drug against {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) infection, {{is generally}} well tolerated, but can cause neurotoxicity such as encephalopathy. Although ganciclovir-induced encephalopathy {{has been described}} in several reports, a literature search revealed that ganciclovir concentrations in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid were previously measured in only 3 patients with encephalopathy. Symptoms usually include confusion and disturbed consciousness, which mimic CMV encephalitis. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is thus sometimes difficult, and is derived solely from accumulated clinical information of definite cases, since ganciclovir concentrations, not routinely measured, become available after several days or a few weeks. Case Presentation: Here, we summarize clinical information of all patients with definite ganciclovir-induced encephalopathy including our own patient, who had severe symptoms, with the highest reported trough concentration of ganciclovir in the blood, and underwent therapeutic dialysis with complete recovery.

40|$|Aim: Oxytocin {{presents}} an exciting potential {{to target the}} core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) pharmacologically in an easily administered, cost-effective form with possibly minimal adverse effects. But, there are still major gaps {{in this area of}} research. This paper reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of oxytocin administration on social cognition and restricted, repetitive behaviors in individuals with an ASD. Method: Electronic literature searches were conducted from PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and EMBASE for RCTs published through June 2015. Results: 12 RCTs were included in this review. 7 out of the 11 studies that examined social cognition reported improvements. Additionally, one out of the 4 studies on restricted, repetitive behaviors, reported improvements following oxytocin administration.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{thorough}} research showing many positive benefits of school choice. However, many questions remain on how school choice works. Rigorous school choice experiments can only determine if access to school choice programs alters student outcomes; they cannot confidently identify the specific mechanisms that mediate various outcomes. Two commonly theorized mechanisms in school choice programs that lead to positive outcomes are (1) an increased access to higher-quality schools and (2) an improved match between schools and students. We examine the existing empirical evidence and the theoretical arguments for these two primary mechanisms. While there is evidence supporting both mechanisms, no studies are able to isolate the effect of quality schools independent of families selecting schools that match their preferences. Since the majority of this research is descriptive and has limited causal interpretation, theory is essential in guiding interpretation and policy implications. Theory suggests that people make choices based on what they believe to be the best match for their children, and those choices lead to incentives for individual schools to improve.

However, little is known about how much software developers are concerned about energy consump-tion, what aspects of energy consumption they consider im-portant, and what solutions they have in mind for improving energy efficiency. In this paper we present the first empir-ical study on understanding the views of application pro-grammers on software energy consumption problems. Using StackOverflow as our primary data source, we analyze a carefully curated sample of more than 300 questions and 550 answers from more than 800 users. With this data, we observed a number of interesting findings. Our study shows that practitioners are aware of the energy consumption prob-lems: the questions they ask are not only diverse – we found 5 main themes of questions – but also often more interest-ing and challenging when compared to the control question set. Even though energy consumption-related questions are popular when considering a number of different popularity measures, the same cannot be said about the quality of their answers.

Methods: We briefly surveyed the American Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, and the British Cancer Research UK database for the latest trends in MM incidence. We did a systematic Pubmed search for other MM reports with tongue metastases. Results and presentation of case: American and British data show that MM incidence in men has stabilised in the last 10 years, earlier than previously predicted. The tongue is an unusual site for MM spread, with ours being only the 9 th such case described. <b>Our</b> <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> published cases of MM metastasising to the tongue brings out our patient to be the least in age(35 years), and the only one to have peritoneal MM as the primary.

40|$|Among vertebrates, most of {{the largest}} genomes are found within the salamanders, a clade of {{amphibians}} that includes 613 species. Salamander genome sizes range from ∼ 14 to ∼ 120 Gb. Because genome size is correlated with nucleus and cell sizes, {{as well as other}} traits, morphological evolution in salamanders has been profoundly affected by genomic gigantism. However, the molecular mechanisms driving genomic expansion in this clade remain largely unknown. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of transposable element (TE) content in salamanders. Using high-throughput sequencing, we generated genomic shotgun data for six species from the Plethodontidae, the largest family of salamanders. We then developed a pipeline to mine TE sequences from shotgun data in taxa with limited genomic resources, such as salamanders. <b>Our</b> <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> overall TE abundance and diversity for each species demonstrate that TEs make up a substantial portion of salamander genomes, and that all of the major known types of TEs are represented in salamanders. The most abundant TE superfamilies found in the genomes of our six focal species are similar, despite substantial variation in genome size. However, our results demonstrate a major difference between salamanders and other vertebrates: salamander genomes contain much larger amounts of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, primarily Ty 3 /gypsy elements. Thus, the extreme increase in genome size that occurred in salamanders was likely accompanied by a shift in TE landscape.
