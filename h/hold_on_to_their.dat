5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason for the lack of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E

5|$|From 1921–22, {{the third}} tier of The Football League {{consisted}} of two parallel sections of 22 clubs, fighting both for promotion to the Second Division and also battling to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> league status. There was a re-election system in place which meant the bottom two teams {{in each of the}} two divisions had to apply for re-election to the league. Watford finished outside the top six league positions in every season between 1922 and 1934. Following Kent's departure in 1926, they finished 21st out of 22 clubs in 1926–27, but were unanimously re-elected to the league after a ballot of clubs in the top two divisions of The Football League. By contrast, under Neil McBain and subsequently Bill Findlay, the team recorded five consecutive top six finishes between 1934–35 and 1938–39, and won the Football League Third Division South Cup in 1937. The Football League was suspended in 1939 due to the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of March 12, elements of the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division were dropped off at designated landing zones around Phuoc An. Initially about 100 South Vietnamese helicopters participated in the operation, and 81 fighter-bombers were deployed to strike at North Vietnamese positions to cover the landings. At 3:10pm, Phu took off in his Cessna U-17 to direct the operation over the skies of Ban Me Thuot. As he approached the battlefield, Phu phoned the South Vietnamese units at Hoa Binh airfield to notify them that an operation was underway, and he encouraged the soldiers to <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> positions. On the morning of March 13, another 145 helicopters were used to complete {{the first phase of}} the operation with the entire 44th Infantry Regiment, the last soldiers of the 45th Infantry Regiment, and the 232nd Artillery Battalion dropped off at various points in Nong Trai, Phuoc An and along Highway 21. At the completion of the landing operation, Phu returned to Pleiku to have a meeting with Thieu, during which they discussed the sudden appearance of the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division.|$|E

40|$|This {{concept paper}} proposes a {{conceptual}} model of employee's job security during economic downturn. Due to the turbulent global economy, natural resources are under strain, austerity cuts are threatening public sector jobs. Organisations are laying off their workforce {{in order to}} cope with the economic conditions. The future has become more unpredictable and uncertain about the workers keeping their jobs. The fear of losing their jobs in the midst of uncertainty becomes a great concern that needs an urgent attention. The question remains, should the organisations lay off their workforces? Or should the employees continue <b>to</b> <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> jobs {{in the midst of this}} economic turbulence? Based on this, the paper examined theoretical issue relating to employees job security in relation to economic downturn. It presents a conceptual model to examine employees' job security during economic downturns, and further argued on the possibilities of employees <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> jobs during economic turbulence...|$|R
