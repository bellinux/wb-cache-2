5|$|In this role, Gilchrist {{is perhaps}} {{disadvantaged}} by his relatively tall stature for a pure wicket-keeper. However, while perhaps not as elegant as some, he has successfully kept wicket for spin bowler Shane Warne and fast bowlers Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee {{for most of}} his international career. His partnerships with McGrath and Lee are second and fourth respectively in both test and ODI history for the number of wickets taken. With Alec Stewart and Mark Boucher, he shares the record for most catches (6) by a wicketkeeper in a ODI match, however <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>now</b> achieved this feat five times, the most recent versus India in 2008 CB Series. The match in 2007 was also the second time he took six dismissals and scored a half century in the same ODI; he remains the only player to do so even once. At Old Trafford in August 2005, he passed Alec Stewart's world record of 4,540 runs as a Test wicketkeeper, Statistically, he is currently the most successful ODI wicket-keeper in history; with 417 catches and 55 stumpings, a total of 472 dismissals, his closest rival, Mark Boucher, is more than 80 dismissals behind.|$|E
5|$|When Seymour later arrives {{that morning}} {{suffering}} a toothache, Mushnick sends Seymour to Dr. Farb, {{who tries to}} remove several of his teeth without anesthetic to get even with Seymour for ruining Farb's flowers.

Seymour is horrified that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>now</b> murdered twice, and after posing as a dentist to avoid the suspicion of Farb's masochistic patient Wilbur Force, Seymour feeds Farb's body to Audrey Jr. The unexplained disappearances {{of the two men}} attract the attention of the police and Mushnick finds himself questioned by Sergeant Joe Fink and his assistant Officer Frank Stoolie (take-offs of Dragnet characters Joe Friday and Frank Smith,). Although Mushnick acts suspiciously nervous, Fink and Stoolie conclude that he knows nothing. Audrey Jr., which has grown several feet tall, is beginning to bud, as is the relationship between Seymour and Audrey (whom Seymour invites on a date).|$|E
