25|$|Phages may be {{released}} via cell lysis, by extrusion, or, {{in a few}} cases, by budding. Lysis, by tailed phages, is achieved by an enzyme called <b>endolysin,</b> which attacks and breaks down the cell wall peptidoglycan. An altogether different phage type, the filamentous phages, make the host cell continually secrete new virus particles. Released virions are described as free, and, unless defective, are capable of infecting a new bacterium. Budding is associated with certain Mycoplasma phages. In contrast to virion release, phages displaying a lysogenic cycle do not kill the host but, rather, become long-term residents as prophage.|$|E

40|$|Bacteriophage-encoded <b>endolysins</b> are {{produced}} {{at the end}} of the phage lytic cycle for the degradation of the host bacterial cell. <b>Endolysins</b> offer the potential as alternatives to antibiotics as biocontrol agents or therapeutics. The lytic mechanisms of three bacteriophage <b>endolysins</b> that target Clostridium species living under different conditions were investigated. For these <b>endolysins</b> a trigger and release mechanism is proposed for their activation. During host lysis, holin lesion formation suddenly permeabilises the membrane which exposes the cytosol-sequestered <b>endolysins</b> to a sudden environmental shock. This shock is suggested to trigger a conformational switch of the <b>endolysins</b> between two distinct dimer states. The switch between dimer states is proposed to activate a novel autocleavage mechanism that cleaves the linker connecting the N-terminal catalytic domain and the C-terminal domain to release the catalytic domain for more efficient digestion of the bacterial cell wall. Crystal structures of cleaved fragments of CD 27 L and CTP 1 L were previously obtained. In these structures cleavage occurs at the stem of the linker connected to the C-terminal domain. Despite a sequence identity of only 22 % between 81 residues of the C-terminal domains of CD 27 L and CTP 1 L, they represent a novel fold that is identified in a number of different lysins. Within the crystal structures the two distinct dimerization modes are represented: the elongated head‐on dimer and the side-by‐side dimer. Introducing mutations that inhibit either of the dimerization states caused a decrease in the efficiency of both the autocleavage mechanism and the lytic activity of the <b>endolysins.</b> The two dimer states were validated for the full-length <b>endolysins</b> in solution by using right angle light scattering, small angle X‐ray scattering and cross-linking experiments.

These <b>endolysins</b> share a modular structure with anNterminal cell wall binding domain and a C-terrninal catalytic domain, a unique property of <b>endolysins</b> belonging to giant phiKZ related phages and some other giant, non-related myoviruses. All three <b>endolysins</b> showed strong muralytic activity on the peptidoglycan of a broad range of Gram-negative bacteria, a feature linked with their modular composition. In case of OBPgp 279, the presence of the cell wall binding domain is responsible for 38 % of the total muralytic activity. Moreover, the binding domain of PVP-SE 1 gp 146 has a binding affinity for Salmonella peptidoglycan that falls within the range of typical cell adhesion molecules. Remarkably, PVP-SElgp 146 shows thermoresistant properties up to temperatures of 90 °C, making it a potential candidate as antibacterial in hurdle technology for food preservation.

Lytic bacteriophages encode peptidoglycan (PG) lytic enzymes able to degrade the PG layer in different steps of their infection cycle. <b>Endolysins</b> degrade the bacterial cell wall {{at the end of}} the infection cycle, causing lysis of the host to release the viral progeny. Recombinant <b>endolysins</b> have been successfully applied as anti-bacterial agent against antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. This has boosted the study of these enzymes as new anti-microbials in different fields (e. g. medical, food technology). A key example is the recent development of endolysin-based anti-bacterials against Gram-negative pathogens in which the exogenous application of <b>endolysins</b> is hindered by the outer membrane (OM). These novel anti-microbials, termed Artilysin (R) s, are able to pass through the OM and reach the PG where they exert their action. In addition, mycobacteria whose cell wall is structurally different from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have also been reported to be inhibited by mycobacteriophage-encoded <b>endolysins.</b> <b>Endolysins</b> and endolysin-based anti-microbials can be considered as ideal candidates for an alternative to antibiotics for several reasons: (1) their unique mode of action and activity against bacterial persisters (independent of an active host metabolism), (2) their selective activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens (including antibiotic resistant strains) and mycobacteria, (3) the limited resistance development reported so far.

40|$|The {{release of}} phage progeny from an {{infected}} bacterium {{is necessary for}} the spread of infection. Only helical phages are secreted from a cell without causing its destruction. The release of remaining phages is correlated with bacterial lysis and death. Thus, the understanding of phage lytic functions is crucial for their use in the fight with bacterial pathogens. Bacteriophages with small RNA or DNA genomes encode single proteins which are called amurins and cause lysis by the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Bacteriophages of double-stranded DNA genomes, which dominate in the environment, encode enzymes that are called <b>endolysins</b> and contribute to lysis by the cleavage of cell wall peptydoglycan. <b>Endolysins</b> that do not contain signal sequences cannot pass the cytoplasmic membrane by themselves. Their access to peptidoglycan is provided by membrane proteins – holins, which can form in the membrane large pores, that are called “holes”. Some <b>endolysins</b> do not require holins for their transport, owing to the presence of the so called SAR sequence at their N-terminus. It enables their transport through the membrane by the bacterial sec system. However, it is not cleaved off, and thus these <b>endolysins</b> remain trapped in the membrane in an inactive form. Their release, which is correlated with the activation, occurs as a result of membrane depolarization and depends on proteins that are called pinholins. Pinholins form in membrane pores that are too small for the passage of <b>endolysins</b> but sufficient for membrane depolarization. Proteins that are called antiholins regulate the timing of lysis, through the blockage of holins action until the end of phage morphogenesis. Additionally, newly identified lytic proteins, spanins, participate in the release of progeny phages from Gram-negative bacteria cells. They cause the destruction of outer cell membrane by its spanning with the cytoplasmic membrane. This is possible after the endolysin-mediated destruction of peptidoglycan, which separates both membranes, and ensures the fast completion of lysis...|$|R
