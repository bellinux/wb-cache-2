40|$|This paper reviews recent {{advances}} {{that have been}} made in enhancing film condensation of fluorocarbon refrigerants in ·a bundle of horizontal tubes. The emphasis in the discussion is on the effects of fin geometry, vapor shear and condensate inundation. It is shown that the fin geometry is an important factor that controls the heat transfer performance. The effect of vapor shear is much smaller for a finned tube than for a smooth tube. The effect of condensate inundation is more marked for a three-dimensional <b>fin</b> <b>tube</b> than for a two-dimensional <b>fin</b> <b>tube.</b> Also, the effect is more marked for an in-line tube bundle than for a staggered tube bundle. For a two-dimensional <b>fin</b> <b>tube</b> with and without the effect of vapor shear and for a bundle of two-dimensional fin tubes with negligible vapor shear, several theoretical models exist that can predict the heat transfer coeffi-cient with sufficient accuracy. The theoretical model can be used to optimize the fin geometry. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of plate fin, <b>fin</b> <b>tube</b> and protrusion parameters on heat transfer and pressure drop {{characteristics of a}} finned tube gas to liquid heat exchanger is examined in this study. The optimization of plate fin, <b>fin</b> <b>tube</b> and protrusion dimensions as well as protrusion locations on plate fin surface is performed numerically using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program named "Fluent". The dimensions of the plate fin of a commercially available combi boiler apparatus heat exchanger are taken as basic dimensions. As the first step, the best plate fin and <b>fin</b> <b>tube</b> geometry is determined. Secondly, the best dimensions for three different protrusions (balcony, winglet and imprint) and their most suitable locations on the plate fin surface are found. Finally, the cumulative effects of several combinations of these three protrusions on the plate fin surface are analyzed. The placement combinations of protrusions are decided according to the results obtained for the individual effect of each protrusion. The fin named as I 5 B 2 W 3 {{is found to be}} the most efficient fin among the investigated cases. A comparison with a numerical and computational study is also performed to validate the numerical results of the present study. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Finned-tube heat {{exchangers}} are predominantly used in space conditioning systems, {{as well as}} other applications requiring heat exchange between two fluids. One important widespread use is in residential air conditioning systems. These residential cooling systems influence the peak demand on the U. S. national electrical system, which occurs on the hot summer afternoons, and thereby sets the requirement for the expensive infrastructure requirement of the nations power plant and electrical distribution system. In addition to this peak demand, these residential air conditioners are major energy users that dominate residential electrical costs and environmental impact. The design of finned-tube {{heat exchangers}} requires the selection of over a dozen design parameters by the designer. The refrigerant side flow and heat transfer characteristics inside the tubes have been thoroughly studied. However, the air side flow around the tube bundle and through the fin gaps is much more complex and depends on over a dozen design parameters. Therefore, experimental measurement of the air side performance is needed. First this study built an experimental system and developed methodology for measuring the air side heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of <b>fin</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchangers. This capability was then used to continue the goal of expanding and clarifying the present knowledge and understanding of air side performance to enable the air conditioner system designer in verifying an optimum <b>fin</b> <b>tube</b> condenser design. In this study eight <b>fin</b> <b>tube</b> heat exchangers were tested over an air flow face velocity range of 5 ?? ft/s (675 - 1600 cfm). The raw data were reduced to the desired heat transfer and friction data, j and f factors. This reduced heat transfer and friction data was plotted versus Reynolds number and compared. The effect of fin spacing, the number of rows and fin enhancement were all investigated. The heat transfer and friction data were also plotted and compared with various correlations available from open literature.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{requirement}} for reduction of energy consumption have been increasing {{to solve the problems}} of the global warming and the short of petroleum resources. For example in the power generation field, as the thermal power generation occupied 60 % of the power generation demand, the improvement of the thermal efficiency is required considerably. This paper described that the pressure drop characteristics of the <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> banks used for the heat exchanger in the thermal power generation were clarified by testing the serrated <b>finned</b> <b>tubes</b> banks for improvement of higher heat transfer and the conventional spiral <b>finned</b> <b>tube</b> banks under the same test conditions, and that the equations to predict pressure drop coefficient which is necessary to design the heat exchanger were proposed...|$|R
