5|$|A {{total score}} of ≤2 {{indicates}} mild croup. The characteristic barking cough and <b>hoarseness</b> may be present, {{but there is}} no stridor at rest.|$|E
5|$|Strep throat is {{unlikely}} when {{any of the}} symptoms of red eyes, <b>hoarseness,</b> runny nose, or mouth ulcers are present. It is also unlikely {{when there is no}} fever.|$|E
5|$|The RLN may be {{compressed}} by tumors. Studies {{have shown}} that 218% of lung cancer patients develop <b>hoarseness</b> because of recurrent laryngeal nerve compression, usually left-sided. This is associated with worse outcomes, and when found as a presenting symptom, often indicates inoperable tumors. The nerve may be severed intentionally during lung cancer surgery in order to fully remove a tumor.|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves may {{be injured}} {{as a result}} of trauma, during surgery, {{as a result of}} tumour spread, or due to other means. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerves can result in a weakened voice (<b>hoarseness)</b> or loss of voice (aphonia) and cause problems in the respiratory tract. Injury to the nerve may paralyze the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle on the same side. This is the sole muscle responsible for opening the vocal cords, and paralysis may cause difficulty breathing (dyspnea) during physical activity. Injury to both the right and left nerve may result in more serious damage, such as the inability to speak. Additional problems may emerge during healing, as nerve fibres that re-anastamose may result in vocal cord motion impairment, uncoordinated movements of the vocal cord.|$|E
5|$|African {{tribes in}} several {{countries}} have termites as totems, {{and for this reason}} tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, <b>hoarseness,</b> influenza, sinusitis, tonsillitis and whooping cough. In Nigeria, Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; this is known as Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where they pray for good health, protection and luck.|$|E
5|$|The cooling {{properties}} of the leaves were used in Britain {{as a treatment for}} trench foot in World War I, and as compresses for ulcers and breast abscesses. Accumulated scientific evidence corroborates that cabbage leaf treatment can reduce the pain and hardness of engorged breasts, and increase the duration of breast feeding. Other medicinal uses recorded in European folk medicine include treatments for rheumatism, sore throat, <b>hoarseness,</b> colic, and melancholy. In the United States, cabbage {{has been used as a}} hangover cure, to treat abscesses, to prevent sunstroke, or to cool body parts affected by fevers. The leaves have also been used to soothe sore feet and, when tied around a child's neck, to relieve croup. Both mashed cabbage and cabbage juice have been used in poultices to remove boils and treat warts, pneumonia, appendicitis, and ulcers.|$|E
25|$|Disturbances of {{the stomach}} and digestion, loss of {{appetite}} or ravenous hunger, vomiting, nausea, weakening of the organs of breathing, coughing, <b>hoarseness,</b> paralysis, weakening of the organ of generation {{to the point of}} impotence, lack of libido, back pain, disorders of the eye and ear, total diminution of bodily powers, paleness, thinness, pimples on the face, decline of intellectual powers, loss of memory, attacks of rage, madness, idiocy, epilepsy, fever and finally suicide.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} after King Ludwig II of Bavaria became a sponsor of Wagner (he granted the {{composer}} a generous stipend, and supported Wagner's artistic endeavours in other ways) that enough resources could be found to mount the premiere of Tristan und Isolde. Hans von Bülow was chosen to conduct the production at the Nationaltheater in Munich, {{despite the fact that}} Wagner {{was having an affair with}} his wife, Cosima von Bülow. Even then, the planned premiere on 15 May 1865 had to be postponed until the Isolde, Malvina Schnorr von Carolsfeld, had recovered from <b>hoarseness.</b> The work finally premiered on 10 June 1865, with Malvina's husband Ludwig partnering her as Tristan.|$|E
25|$|SS {{can damage}} vital organs {{of the body}} with {{symptoms}} that may plateau or worsen, or go into remission as with other autoimmune diseases. Some people may experience only the mild symptoms of dry eyes and mouth, while others have symptoms of severe disease. Many patients can treat problems symptomatically. Others are forced to cope with blurred vision, constant eye discomfort, recurrent mouth infections, swollen parotid glands, dysphonia (vocal disorders including <b>hoarseness),</b> and difficulty in swallowing and eating. Debilitating fatigue and joint pain can seriously impair quality of life. Some patients can develop renal (kidney) involvement (autoimmune tubulointerstitial nephritis) leading to proteinuria (excess protein in urine), urinary concentrating defect, and distal renal tubular acidosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of diphtheria usually begin two {{to seven days}} after infection. Symptoms of diphtheria include fever of 38°C (100.4°F) or above, chills, fatigue, bluish skin coloration (cyanosis), sore throat, <b>hoarseness,</b> cough, headache, difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge, and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose. This thick gray coating is called a “pseudomembrane.” It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making {{it very hard to}} breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.|$|E
25|$|A large {{clinical}} study of high to very high oral dosages of NET (10 to 40mg/day) administered for prolonged {{periods of time}} (4 to 35 weeks) to prevent miscarriage in pregnant women found that 5.5% of the women experienced mild androgenic side effects such as mild voice changes (<b>hoarseness),</b> acne, and hirsutism and that 18.3% of female infants born to the mothers showed, in most cases only slight, virilization of the genitals. Maternal androgenic symptoms occurred most often in women who received a dosage of NET of 30mg/day or more {{for a period of}} 15weeks or longer. In the female infants who experienced virilization of the genitals, the sole manifestation in 86.7% of the cases was varied but almost always slight enlargement of the clitoris. In the remaining 13.3% of the affected cases, marked clitoral enlargement and partial fusion of the labioscrotal folds occurred. The dosages used in these cases were 20 to 40mg/day.|$|E
500|$|In early 1950, when.he was 55, Kimball, who {{had never}} smoked or used tobacco, began {{experiencing}} persistent <b>hoarseness</b> and after a physical examination, he underwent a biopsy of a white spot in his throat. The biopsy caused some brief voice impairment and indicated that Kimball had a throat infection but not cancer. In late 1956, Kimball's <b>hoarseness</b> returned, coupled with occasional bleeding {{in the back of}} his throat. Kimball's physician sent him to New York City to meet with Dr. Hayes Martin (18921977), an expert on cancers of the head and neck. [...] Martin performed another biopsy, which indicated [...] "borderline malignancy," [...] and in early 1957, Martin recommended immediate surgery. Kimball had neglected to seek approval from church president David O. McKay regarding his 1957 biopsy. At the time, the biopsy itself could cause permanent vocal damage. He felt that as an apostle, he should have sought McKay's approval before he underwent surgical procedures that could render him incapable of fulfilling apostolic duties.|$|E
500|$|Croup is {{characterized}} by a [...] "barking" [...] cough, stridor, <b>hoarseness,</b> and difficulty breathing which usually worsens at night. The [...] "barking" [...] cough is often described as resembling the call of a seal or sea lion. [...] The stridor is worsened by agitation or crying, and if it can be heard at rest, it may indicate critical narrowing of the airways. As croup worsens, stridor may decrease considerably.|$|E
500|$|The auditory, or [...] "acoustic" [...] {{abnormalities}} {{observed with}} the syndrome include {{sensorineural hearing loss}} and <b>hoarseness.</b> Two affected Turkish brothers with a mild form of this hearing loss, and a hoarse voice were reported. A laryngoscopic examination of both brothers revealed swelling of the vocal cords, and a malformed epiglottis. Sensorineural-associated hearing impairment and hoarsness was also observed in a 10-year-old girl and her father, and {{in a number of}} other cases.|$|E
500|$|Frederick {{had been}} a heavy smoker for many years. At a ball held by William on 31 January 1887, a guest {{reported}} the Crown Prince [...] "was so hoarse that he could hardly say a word." [...] His <b>hoarseness</b> continued through February, and was diagnosed as a thickening of the mucous membrane over the vocal cords, caused by [...] "a chronic laryngeal catarrh." [...] On 7 February, Frederick consulted a doctor, Karl Gerhardt, who scraped a wire across the membrane for 10 days {{in an attempt to}} remove thickened tissue. After the procedure proved unsuccessful, Gerhardt cauterised the left vocal cord with an electric wire on 15 March in an attempt to remove what was then thought to be a vocal fold nodule. Due to Frederick's highly inflamed throat, Gerhardt was unable to remove the entire growth. After several cauterisations, and with no signs of improvement, Frederick and his wife went to the spa of Bad Ems, where he drank the mineral waters and underwent a regimen of gargles and inhaling fresh air, with no effect.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{operations}} on {{his throat and}} having taken the sea air at Cowes, Frederick remained hoarse, and was advised by Mackenzie to spend the coming winter on the Italian Riviera. In August, following reports {{that his father was}} gravely ill, he considered returning to Germany, but was dissuaded by his wife, and went to Toblach in South Tyrol with his family, where Victoria had rented a house. He arrived in Toblach on 7 September, exhausted and hoarse. Concerned by Frederick's lack of visible improvement after a brief meeting with Frederick in Munich, Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg consulted the distinguished laryngologist Max Joseph Oertel, who urged a drastic and thorough operation on Frederick's throat, and said he suspected a benign tumour which could soon become malignant. By this time, Mackenzie's treatment of Frederick was generating strong criticism. After a fortnight in Toblach, Mackenzie arrived to reexamine Frederick, who had continued to suffer from colds and hoarseness; in public, however, the doctor remained largely unconcerned, and attributed the <b>hoarseness</b> to a [...] "momentary chill." [...] However, he recommended that Frederick should leave Toblach for Venice, to be followed by Victoria. The weather soon turned cold, and Frederick's throat caused him pain, for which he received cocaine injections.|$|E
500|$|On 26 December 1887, Frederick {{wrote that}} his [...] "chronic catarrh" [...] {{appeared}} to be taking [...] "a turn for the better and that [...] "a further bond has been forged between our people and myself; may God preserve it by giving me, when I resume my duties, the capacity to prove myself worthy of the great trust that has been shown me!" [...] A week later, however, on 5 January 1888, his <b>hoarseness</b> and the swelling under his left vocal cord returned, with the previously unaffected {{right side of his}} throat becoming inflamed. He ran high fevers and began coughing violently, with his breathing becoming more laboured. The doctors diagnosed perichondritis, an infection of the throat membrane. Frederick again became unable to speak, and suffered violent headaches and insomnia. On 29 January, Mackenzie returned to San Remo from a trip to Spain, and after examining his patient recommended an immediate tracheotomy. [...] The operation was conducted at 4 p.m. on 8 February, by which time Frederick was continually suffering from insomnia and [...] "embarrassing bouts of suffocation." [...] A cannula was fitted to allow Frederick to breathe; for the remainder of his life he was unable to speak and often communicated through writing. During the operation, Dr. Bergmann almost killed him by missing the incision in the trachea and forcing the cannula into the wrong place. [...] Frederick started to cough and bleed, and Bergmann placed his forefinger into the wound to enlarge it. The bleeding subsided after two hours, but Bergmann's actions resulted in an abscess in Frederick's neck, producing pus which would give Frederick discomfort for the remaining months of his life. Later, Frederick would ask [...] "Why did Bergmann put his finger in my throat?" [...] and complain that [...] "Bergmann ill-treated [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Vagal paraganglioma: These are {{the least}} common {{of the head and}} neck paragangliomas. [...] They usually present as a painless neck mass, but may result in {{dysphagia}} and <b>hoarseness.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... voice (<b>hoarseness</b> (dysphonia), poor vocal volume (hypophonia), {{abnormal}} (e.g. rough, breathy, strained) vocal quality. Research demonstrates {{voice therapy}} {{to be especially}} helpful with certain patient populations; individuals with Parkinson's Disease often develop voice issues {{as a result of}} their disease.|$|E
2500|$|Laryngeal {{diphtheria}} {{can lead}} to a characteristic swollen neck and throat, or [...] "bull neck". The swollen throat is often accompanied by a serious respiratory condition, characterized by a brassy or [...] "barking" [...] cough, stridor, <b>hoarseness,</b> and difficulty breathing, and historically referred to variously as [...] "diphtheritic croup", [...] "true croup", or sometimes simply as [...] "croup". Diphtheritic croup is extremely rare in countries where diphtheria vaccination is customary. As a result, the term [...] "croup" [...] nowadays most often refers to an unrelated viral illness that produces similar but milder respiratory symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|He apologised for his {{interview}} performance {{the following day}} saying, [...] "It wasn't my best performance and I would like to apologise for that. I would hate to think {{the reputation of the}} country or the office of taoiseach would in any way be affected by what I had to say." [...] He claimed that there was a <b>hoarseness</b> in his voice and denied that he had been hungover. His version of this event was substantiated in 2017 by {{his interview}}er who stated that Cowen was weary and not drunk or hungover.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the skull}} base is {{progressively}} involved, the adjacent exiting cranial nerves and their branches, especially {{the facial nerve}} and the vagus nerve, may be affected, resulting in facial paralysis and <b>hoarseness,</b> respectively. If both of the recurrent laryngeal nerves are paralyzed, shortness of breath may develop and necessitate tracheotomy. Profound deafness can occur, usually later in the disease course due to relative resistance of the inner ear structures. [...] Gallium scans are sometimes used to document {{the extent of the}} infection but are not essential to disease management. Skull base osteomyelitis is a chronic disease that can require months of IV antibiotic treatment, tends to recur, and has a significant mortality rate.|$|E
2500|$|The Middle Ages saw {{tonsillectomy}} {{fall into}} disfavor; Ambroise Pare (1509) wrote {{it to be}} [...] "a bad operation" [...] and suggested a procedure that involved gradual strangulation with a ligature. This method was not popular with the patients due to the immense pain it caused and the infection that usually followed. Scottish physician Peter Lowe in 1600 summarized the three methods in use at the time, including the snare, the ligature, and the excision. At the time, {{the function of the}} tonsils was thought to be absorption of secretions from the nose; it was assumed that removal of large amounts of tonsillar tissue would interfere with the ability to remove these secretions, causing them to accumulate in the larynx, resulting in <b>hoarseness.</b> For this reason, physicians like Dionis (1672) and Lorenz Heister censured the procedure.|$|E
2500|$|Andrews {{was forced}} to quit the show {{towards the end of}} the Broadway run in 1997 when she {{developed}} <b>hoarseness</b> in her voice. She subsequently underwent surgery at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital to remove non-cancerous nodules from her throat. (However, Andrews has recently stated that it was due to [...] "a certain kind of muscular striation [...] happens on the vocal cords" [...] as a result of strain from Victor/Victoria, adding [...] "I didn't have cancer, I didn't have nodules, I didn't have anything.") She emerged from the surgery with permanent damage that destroyed the purity of her singing and gave a rasp to her speaking voice. In 1999 she filed a malpractice suit against the doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital, including Scott Kessler and Jeffrey Libin, who had operated on her throat. Originally, the doctors assured Andrews that she should regain her voice within six weeks, but Andrews' stepdaughter Jennifer Edwards said in 1999 [...] "it's been two years, and it [...] still hasn't returned." [...] The lawsuit was settled in September 2000 for an undisclosed amount.|$|E
