40|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{ventilation}} is a cost-effective method to lower respirable <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> in all types of mining applications. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has been working on a number of different research techniques that use ventilation as a critical component to lower respirable dust levels at surface and metal/nonmetal operations in the United States. This article presents five such research efforts. The first research area discusses how improving the ventilation flow patterns in an iron ore mill facility lowered respirable <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> by 31 pct throughout the primary grinding area. The second research area examines how respirable dust levels were lowered at a dimensional stone shop by using air cleaning units suspended from the ceiling. A third area discusses how improvements in ventilation at underground limestone mines lowered respirable <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The fourth area examines how improvements in dust filtration and pressurization systems significantly impacted the air quality in enclosed cabs of surface mining equipment.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{understand}} the variations of selenium (Se) concentration relative {{to changes in}} occupational exposure to coal dust, taking into account age and changes in smoking habits in miners surveyed twice, in 1990  and 1994.  To better {{understand the}} relation of Se concentration with glutathione peroxidase activities (GSH-Px) in these miners.  METHODS—In 1994, blood samples were obtained from active (n= 131) and retired (n= 40) miners without coal worker's pneumoconiosis, in whom Se concentration was available at both surveys and in whom International Labour Organisation (ILO) profusion grade had not been changed. Active miners were exposed to high <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> (n= 48) or low <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> (n= 83). Miners were classified into three subgroups according to their estimated cumulative exposure to dust, and into three subgroups according to their smoking habits.  RESULTS—Selenium concentration and GSH-Px activities were significantly lower in active than in retired miners (Se adjusted means: 62. 6  v 72. 2  ng/ml p= 0. 01). Moreover, Se concentration was lower in miners exposed to high compared with those exposed to low <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> (adjusted means: 59. 4  v 65. 8). In miners exposed to high <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations,</b> Se concentration was significantly lower whereas erythrocyte GSH-Px activity was significantly higher in the subgroup with estimated cumulative exposure > 68 mg/m 3. y. In all miners, plasma GSH-Px activity was correlated with Se concentration (r= 0. 22, p< 0. 005). The 4  year Se changes were negatively related to exposure to high <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and positively related to change in exposure from high to retirement and to change from smoker to ex-smoker (p= 0. 01).  CONCLUSION—The variations of Se concentration in relation to changes in occupational exposure to coal dust and in smoking habits, and the close correlation found between plasma Se concentration and GSH-Px activity suggest that both are required in antioxidant defence. These results agree well with {{the hypothesis that the}} decrease in Se concentration reflects its use against reactive oxygen species generated by exposure to coal mine dust and by smoking.    Keywords: antioxidant enzymes; coal miners; dust exposure; selenium; reactive oxygen specie...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} odour, {{greenhouse}} gas emissions and indoor air quality in swine buildings have become a great concern for the neighbouring communities as well as governments. Air dispersion models have been adopted widely as an approach to address these problems which determine science-based distance between livestock production site and neighbours. However, no existing model considers the diurnal and seasonal variations of odour, gas (ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, greenhouse gas), and <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and emissions, which may cause great uncertainty. The primary objective of this project is to monitor and model the diurnal and seasonal variations of odour, gases, and <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and emissions from nursery, farrowing, and gestation rooms. Additionally, this study tried to quantify the greenhouse gas contribution from swine buildings and evaluate the indoor air quality of swine barns. Strip-block experimental design {{was used to measure}} the diurnal variation of odour and gas concentrations and emissions in PSC Elstow Research Farm. It was found that: 1) odour and gas concentrations in winter were significantly higher than those in mild and warm weather conditions for all three rooms (P 0. 05); 3) significant diurnal variations occurred in August and April (P 0. 05); 4) apparent diurnal variation patterns were observed in August and April for NH 3, H 2 S and CO 2 concentrations, being high in the early morning and low in the late afternoon; 5) positive correlation was found between odour concentrations and NH 3, H 2 S, and CO 2 concentrations, respectively. A whole year (August 2006 to July 2007) monitoring of odour, gas and <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and emissions revealed that: 1) significant seasonal effect on odour and gas concentrations and emissions, total <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> and <b>dust</b> depositions were observed (...|$|R

40|$|Objective- A {{case study}} {{was carried out}} to assess cement dust {{exposure}} and its determinants among construction workers and for comparison among workers in cement and concrete production. Methods- Full-shift personal exposure measurements were performed and samples were analysed for inhalable dust and its cement content. Exposure variability was modelled with linear mixed models. Results- Inhalable <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> at the construction site ranged from 0. 05 to 34 mg/m(3), {{with a mean of}} 1. 0 mg/m(3). Average concentration for inhalable cement dust was 0. 3 mg/m(3) (GM; range 0. 02 - 17 mg/m(3)). Levels in the ready-mix and pre-cast concrete plants were on average 0. 5 mg/m(3) (GM) for inhalable dust and 0. 2 mg/m(3) (GM) for inhalable cement <b>dust.</b> Highest <b>concentrations</b> were measured in cement production, particularly during cleaning tasks (inhalable dust GM = 55 mg/m(3); inhalable cement dust GM = 33 mg/m(3)) at which point the workers wore personal protective equipment. Elemental measurements showed highest but very variable cement percentages in the cement plant and very low percentages during reinforcement work and pouring. Most likely other sources were contributing to <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations,</b> particularly at the construction site. Within job groups, temporal variability in exposure concentrations generally outweighed differences in average concentrations between workers. 'Using a broom', 'outdoor wind speed' and 'presence of rain' were overall the most influential factors affecting inhalable (cement) dust exposure. Conclusion- Job type appeared to be the main predictor of exposure to inhalable (cement) dust at the construction site. Inhalable <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> in cement production plants, especially during cleaning tasks, are usually considerably higher than at the construction site...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To better {{understand}} the relations between occupational exposure, blood antioxidant enzyme activities, total plasma antioxidant concentration, and the severity of coal workers' pneumoconiosis (CWP). METHODS: Blood samples were obtained from miners without CWP exposed to low <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> for > or = 4 years {{at the time of}} the study (n = 105), or exposed to high <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> for > or = 14 years {{at the time of the}} study (n = 58), and from retired miners with CWP (n = 19). Miners without CWP were classified into three subgroups according to their estimated cumulative exposure to dust. Chest x ray films were obtained for each miner. Miners were classified in five subgroups according to their International Labour Organisation (ILO) profusion grades. Univariate tests were completed by multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: The estimated cumulative exposure to dust was strongly positively related to erythrocyte catalase activity and strongly negatively related to Cu++/Zn++ SOD activity only in miners exposed to high <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> for > or = 14 years at the time of the study (F tests p = 0. 006 and p = 0. 004 respectively). Moreover, catalase activity was strongly related to the severity of CWP expressed as five subgroups of ILO profusion grades (F test p = 0. 003); the greatest difference in the mean values was found between the group of 1 / 1 to 1 / 2 ILO profusion grades and the group of 2 / 1 to 3 / 3 ILO profusion grades. CONCLUSION: These results are in good agreement with the hypothesis that production of reactive oxygen species may be an important event in the exposure to coal mine dusts and the severity of CWP. Erythrocyte catalase and Cu++/Zn++ SOD activities are more closely related to recent exposure to high <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> than to cumulative exposure, and could be considered as biological markers of exposure rather than as markers of early adverse biological effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} and evaluate the performance of a whole-body human exposure chamber for controlled test atmospheres of gases and particulates. The chamber was constructed from Plexiglass, has a volume of 75 ft 3, operated at a flowrate of 33. 8 CFM, and both the makeup and exhaust air are HEPA filtered. Fly ash dust was generated using a Wright Dust Feeder. An elutriator was used to eliminate particles larger 8 μm aerodynamic diameter from the airstream. A direct reading instrument, the Rupprecht and Patashnick PM- 10 TEOM, was used for determination of particle concentration. Particle size distributions were determined by a QCM cascade impactor. Data from gravimetric analysis were used to test for the evenness of <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the chamber. CO 2 is used as a representative gas and its concentration was measured using the Metrosonics aq- 5000. Total <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> as measured by the TEOM, in μg/m 3, at 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 6 and 1. 6 RPMs of the Wright Dust Feeder, were 110 + 2. 8, 173 + 8. 5, 398 + 20 and 550 + 17, respectively. For these RPMs, particle size distributions were associated with a MMD of 1. 27 μm and a GSD of 2. 35, a MMD of 1. 39 and a GSD of 2. 22, a MMD of 1. 46 and a GSD of 2. 08, a MMD of 1. 15 and a GSD of 2. 2, respectively. Total <b>dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> as measured by gravimetric analysis, in μg/m 3 for the respirable fraction. <b>Dust</b> <b>concentrations</b> measured at different points within the chamber showed uniform distribution with a variability less than 10 %. Similarly, the particle size distributions were found to be consistent across the different RPMs settings. Regarding carbon dioxide, its concentration was straightforward and the measured and theoretical maximum concentration levels were in agreement. The performance of this whole-body human exposure chamber has been characterized and evaluated for low levels of particles and gases and now it is a valuable research tool for inhalation challenge studies...|$|R
