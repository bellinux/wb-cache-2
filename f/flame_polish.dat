50|$|<b>Flame</b> <b>{{polishing}}</b> is {{a method}} of polishing a material, usually thermoplastics or glass, by exposing it to a flame or heat. By melting {{the surface of the}} material, surface tension smooths the surface out. Operator skill is critical with this method. When done properly, <b>flame</b> plastic <b>polishing</b> produces the clearest finish, especially when polishing acrylic. This method is most applicable to flat external surfaces. <b>Flame</b> <b>polishing</b> is frequently used in acrylic plastic fabrication because of its high speed when compared to abrasive methods. In this application, a torch burning hydrogen and oxygen is typically used, one reason being that the flame chemistry is unlikely to contaminate the plastic.|$|R
5000|$|Ends are {{generally}} rounded by <b>flame</b> <b>polished</b> to prevent scratching on surface of glassware which {{may lead to}} cracks later on, especially when glassware are heated.|$|R
50|$|The exposed side(s) of the {{material}} was <b>flame</b> <b>polished,</b> which left the product highly reflective and brilliant. Later manufacturing techniques used fine sand to polish the surface, followed by felt blocks and iron(III) oxide powder.|$|R
50|$|Although modifying glass tubing is {{no longer}} an {{essential}} laboratory technique, many are still familiar with the basic methods. A glass cutter is used to break pieces of glass tubing into smaller pieces. Freshly cut edges are <b>flame</b> <b>polished</b> before use to remove the rough edge. Glass tubing can be bent by heating evenly over a Bunsen flame to red heat. Hose barbs can be added to tubing, giving a better grip and seal for attaching plastic or rubber tubing.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was made}} using the ancient lost-wax casting method. In this method, the sculptor makes a full-size {{model of the}} sculpture in wax. From the wax, a plaster cast is then made, and the wax is melted out. Then, molten bronze is poured into the mold, and it assumes {{the shape of the}} wax. Finally, the plaster cast is removed, leaving behind the sculpture in bronze. The wax version of this sculpture was made from one-quarter-inch wax sheets, then the final touches were added by <b>flame</b> <b>polishing.</b> The final version of the wax sculpture weighed 50 pounds. It was taken to a foundry in Cleveland to be cast in bronze.|$|R

40|$|High laser intensities {{are being}} {{transmitted}} through optical fibers {{in a growing}} number of applications. The author`s interest in laser initiation of explosives has led him to examine the transmission of Q-switched, Nd:YAG laser pulses through step-index, multimode, fused-silica fibers for a number of years. A common limiting process is a plasma-forming breakdown occurring at the fiber entrance face. The breakdown threshold at this face depends on the surface characteristics that result from the particular method of end-face preparation. In previous studies he examined entrance-face breakdown thresholds for several different mechanical polishing schedules, and also for several schedules of CO{sub 2 }-laser conditioning following mechanical polishing. In the present study he examined three end-face preparation methods that were based on the recent availability of exceptionally good cleaved surfaces for the fibers of interest. Using test procedures similar to those in past studies, he examined the cleaved fibers directly, fibers with cleaved surfaces that were subsequently <b>flame</b> <b>polished,</b> and fibers with cleaved surfaces that were subsequently conditioned with a CO{sub 2 } laser. All of these preparation methods resulted in fibers that showed a broader range of entrance-face breakdown conditions than found in past studies, together with a susceptibility to subsurface exit-face damage. By introducing additional cleaning steps with the cleaved surfaces, he was able to reduce the variability in breakdown thresholds observed after subsequent CO{sub 2 }-laser conditioning. A consistent location of exit-face damage sites indicates that subsurface fracturing occurs during the cleaving process, and that the subsequent end-face processing steps were not effective in mitigating damage at these sites. Threshold energies for entrance-face breakdown are also affected by the relation between incident laser energy and the resulting peak local fluence at this surface...|$|R
50|$|A massive {{explosion}} {{occurred at}} the factory at 7:37 a.m. At the time, more than 260 people were present, which {{was more than the}} usual amount of employees working since overtime wages were doubled during the weekends. 44 people died {{at the scene of the}} explosion, while another 31 died at local hospitals. Five hospitals in Kunshan and nearby Suzhou treated over 180 wounded. It is believed the explosion may have been caused by <b>flames</b> igniting metal <b>polishing</b> dust.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} the determination of the total content of Cu, Pb and Zn by the method of atomic absorption spectrometry with atomization in an air-acetylene <b>flame</b> in <b>Polish</b> honeys samples. The research material was a honeydew, monofloral honey and buckwheat honey. For the mineralization of samples, the following solutions were applied:  1) HNO 3 (conc), 2) HNO 3 (conc) and H 2 O 2 (conc)  in the volume ratio equal to 4 : 1 and 3 : 1. On the basis of the results and recommended food standards the percentage of the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) in connection with the consumption of 100 g of product were estimated. To verify the results validation of analytical method used was carried out. It was included defining the following validation parameters values: the limit of detection and quantification; linearity and measurement range; repeatability and accuracy of the results. The contamination of the analyzed honeys by Pb is higher than the acceptable level of contamination of this element. The highest contents of Cu and Zn were characterized by monofloral honeys...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} {{a number of}} gas <b>flames</b> for fire <b>polishing</b> borosilicate glass capillaries used in the manufacturing of IVF micro-pipettes. Hydrofluoric acid (HF) was also used {{as an alternative to}} finish the pipette end. Glass micro tools in the IVF industry are drawn from hollow glass capillaries of diameter 1 mm. These capillaries are cut manually to a length of 100 mm from hollow glass rods resulting in sharp and chipped edges. These capillaries are held in a customised holder having padding of soft silicone or rubber. Sharp and uneven edges of these capillaries pick up particles of rubber or soft silicone shavings, rendering them ineffective for IVF treatments. The working range of borosilicate glass is 800 - 1, 200 degrees C. The experiments involved analysis of fire polishing process for borosilicate glass capillaries using candle, butane, propane, 2350 butane propane, oxyacetylene gas flames, finding the optimum distance of the capillary relative to the flame, optimum time for which the capillary should be held in the flame and optimum region of the flame which gives the required temperature range. The results show that 2350 butane propane gas mix is optimum for fire polishing of borosilicate glass capillaries. The paper is concluded by comparing the results of fire polishing with the results of acid polishing, in which HF of 1. 6 % concentration is used to etch the ends of the borosilicate glass pipettes...|$|R
40|$|The {{aggregation}} method utilizes outbred blastocysts {{which are}} easier to obtain in numbers. The ES cells are intorduced into the developing embryo by the adherance of the cells to a dezonulated 8 cell stage embryo. The embryos are cultured to blastocysts and then transfered into a pseudopregnant hybrid (C 57 X CBA) F 1 recipient. ### Method: **Preparation of the aggregation plate. ** Aggregation {{and culture of the}} embryos with the ES cells is performed in microwells prepared in a plastic tissue culture plate using a darning needle. 1. In a 6 cm petri dish add up to 10 drops of M 16 media (ca. 3 - 4 mm, larger allows too muh turbulence when the palte is moved). - Cover the entire plate with parafin or Dow Corning Fluid 200 (viscosity 50 cs). - Sterilize a darning needle by dipping in ethanol and ignite. Note be very careful not to burn the plastic layer off (ie. don't place in a bunsen burner). Just sterilizing in ethanol is probably sufficient and more"needle friendly". - Press the darning needle through the oil and media into the palstic and make a circular movement with the free end of the needle but DO NOT twist the needle (it scores the sides). The well should be ca. 300 um dia with a smooth wall. *NOTE. In our experience it is critical to make the wells through the oil and media rather than on a dry plate, presumably to make smooth (lubricated) wells. When we made wells on dry plates the embryos always died*. - Make 5 - 6 wells in each drop and then return the plate to the incubator. **Removal of the Zona pellucida from the embryo. ** After recovering 2. 5 day mouse embryos (see Flushing Morula protocol) the zona is removed in acid Tyrode's solution. Acid Tyrode's: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") - Make to 90 ml with Travenol water and dissolve components. Adjust pH to 2. 5 with 5 M HCl and make to 100 ml with Travenol water. Filter sterilize and make aliquots of 1 ml. Store at - 20 °C. - Warm to room temperature before use. - After removing the zona the embryos become extremely sticky and therefore siliconized pipettes are required for handling them. **Siliconizing Capillary Glass** Embryos that have had the zona pellucida (jelly-like outer coating) removed are "sticky" to handle, often getting stuck inside the transfer pipette during handling. This problem is overcome by siliconizing the capillary glass (inside only) before it is used to fashion transfer pipettes. NOTE: This procedure must be carried out wearing gloves in a fume hood! Use a 27 gauge needle and 3 cc syringe (filled) to run a small amount of silicone (Sigmacote) through the inside of a piece of capillary glass, allowing excess Sigmacote to drip into a 10 ml tube. This is repeated with each piece of glass and the glass placed in a measuring cylinder. The excess Sigmacote in the 10 ml tube may be used to refill the syringe when empty. Once 50 - 80 pieces have been siliconized the glass is rinsed no less than eight times with Milli-Q water, shaking the water out of the glass by hand after each rinse. The glass is then rinsed six times with "Travenol" water. The cylinder is then sealed with Parafilm which is punctured several times with a needle to allow evaporation with minimal dust collection. The cylinder is placed in a hot air oven to speed evaporation. Once completely dry, the glass is ready to use. Sigmacote is made by Sigma Chemicals. The catalogue number for Sigmacote is SL- 2 **Dezonulating** 1. Put several drops of M 16 and also acid Tyrodes into a small petri dish (do not mix). - Transfer all of the embryos to one of the drops of M 16. We use Random bred Swiss embryos. - Collect up to 50 embryos (less if unable to handle that no. quickly) with as little media as possible and transfer to a drop of acid Tyrodes, then transfer immediately to a fresh drop of acid Tyrodes. - Agitate the embryos while watching them under the scope. - Transfer the embryos to a drop of M 16 as soon as the zona dissolves. This should take around 90 seconds. - Rinse in a second drop of M 16 immediately and then transfer to the aggregation plate, placing one embryo in each well. Return plate to the incubator. - We include a control of 6 - 8 unmanipulated embryos during the culture period. **Preparation of ES cells for aggregation** We use small clumps of ES cells rather than single ES cells as these are much easier to place in the wells. The cells are harvested essentially as described in "Passaging and Spliting ES cells" except {{that at the end of}} the tyripsinization step they are GENTLY pipetted up and down 6 - 8 times rather than the vigourous motion usually used to create a single cell suspension. This yields clumps of cells of 4 - 12. 1. Aspirate media from the plate, wash with 5 ml PBS and with 5 ml PBS/EGTA. Aspirate and place plate on 37 °C warming tray. - After 2 - 5 min. remove the flask and checl under the dissecting scope. Individual cells should be apparent in the collonies. - Add 1 ml trypsin/EDTA and rock flask back and forward for ca. 1 min. until the cells lift off the plate. Gently pipette the cells up and down with a 1 ml pipette 6 times and then add 1 ml of ES cell media. Wash gently up and down several times. - Add cells to 2 ml of ES cell media to dilute to an appropriate concentration. **Aggregation** 1. Using a pasteur pipette, place a drop of suspended ES cell clumps in a small petri dish. - Under the dissecting scope and using a very narrow siliconized transfer pipette, select clumps of 5 - 10 cells. Transfer one clump to each well and watch to be sure that it comes to rest adjacent to the embryo. Very carefully return the plate to the incubator once all the embryos and wells are filled. - Our embryos take 24 hours to develop to expanded blastocysts at which point they are transfered into psuedopregnant (C 57 X CBA) F 1 mice using a siliconized, <b>flame</b> <b>polished</b> pipette. **Removal of Expanded Blastocysts from Aggregation Wells** Before attempting to remove expanded blastocysts, make sure that the pipette is wide enough. To remove blasts from wells, fill a transfer pipette with M 16 up to the end of the narrow pulled section then position the end over each well and blow the embryos out. Arrange them in groups of 12 for easy collection during transfer...|$|R
