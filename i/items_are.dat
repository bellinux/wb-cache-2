5|$|Swords are {{included}} in the crafts category, and either the sword itself or a sword mounting is designated as a National Treasure. Currently 110 swords and 12 sword mountings are National Treasures. The oldest designated properties date to the seventh century (Asuka period). However, 86 of the <b>items</b> <b>are</b> from the Kamakura period, with the most recent object from the Muromachi period. The designated <b>items</b> <b>are</b> located in Buddhist temples, Shinto shrines, museums, and private collections.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{statistical}} analysis, 8 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected from physical (literacy) environment, 8 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected from parent literacy habits, 6 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected from child literacy habits, 23 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected from parent-child interaction for language and literacy activities, and 10 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected from parental beliefs, {{to make a}} questionnaire containing 55 items (Refer to Additional file  3). However, we acknowledge the limitation that the sample size of experts we had was small for the analyses.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the more}} than four {{thousand}} items collected, {{only about a third}} came from the professional literature, and the other two-thirds from non-academic sources. These <b>items</b> <b>were</b> classified, similar <b>items</b> <b>were</b> eliminated, and the remaining <b>items</b> <b>were</b> rewritten to be clear. The rewritten <b>items</b> <b>were</b> then classified into 33 subcategories, and the subcategories supplemented with newly generated items to give equal coverage.|$|R

40|$|Purpose Computer-adaptive tests (CATs) {{can measure}} {{precisely}} at individual level with few items selected from an item bank. Our {{aim was to}} select fatigue items to develop a CAT for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and include expert opinions that are important for content validity of measurement instruments. Methods <b>Items</b> <b>were</b> included from existing fatigue questionnaires and generated from interview material. In a Delphi procedure, rheumatologists, nurses, and patients evaluated the initial pool of 294 <b>items.</b> <b>Items</b> <b>were</b> selected for the CAT development if rated as adequate by at least 80 % of the participants (when 50 % or less agreed, they <b>were</b> excluded). Remaining <b>items</b> <b>were</b> adjusted based on participants’ comments and re-evaluated in the next round. The procedure stopped when all <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected or rejected. Results A total of 10 rheumatologists, 20 nurses, and 15 rheumatoid arthritis patients participated. After the first round, 96 of 294 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> directly selected. Nine <b>items</b> <b>were</b> directly excluded, and remaining <b>items</b> <b>were</b> adjusted. In the second round, 124 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> presented for re-evaluation. Ultimately, 245 <b>items</b> <b>were</b> selected. Conclusion This study revealed a qualitatively evaluated <b>item</b> pool to <b>be</b> used for the item bank/CAT development. The Delphi procedure is a beneficial approach to select adequate items for measuring fatigue in R...|$|R
5|$|Enemies {{can hear}} {{footsteps}} and other sounds. When Fiona is {{in a dangerous}} situation, she may fall into a panic. During panic mode, visibility gets worse, the menu can't be opened, and she will begin running on her own, tripping and falling into walls. Panic mode will elapse after some time, or certain items {{can be used to}} calm her down. If Fiona sustains a significant amount of damage, she will slow down and become unable to backstep. If she receives too much damage she can die. Damage heals with time or items can be used to bring her vitality back to normal. While some <b>items</b> <b>are</b> used to heal Fiona and Hewie, others are used to damage enemies. Some can be thrown while others are set like traps for the enemy to walk over. Some <b>items</b> <b>are</b> found by searching while others can be crafted in refining rooms.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fruit and seeds, {{a number of}} other food <b>items</b> <b>are</b> taken by many species. Some, particularly the ground doves and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms. One species, the atoll fruit dove, is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey. Snails, moths, and other insects are taken by white-crowned pigeons, orange fruit doves, and ruddy ground doves.|$|E
5|$|Kansai, {{the region}} of Japan's capitals from ancient times to the 19th century, has the most National Treasures; Kyoto alone has about one in five National Treasures. Fine arts and crafts {{properties}} are generally owned privately or are in museums, including national museums such as Tokyo, Kyoto, and Nara, public prefectural and city museums, and private museums. Religious <b>items</b> <b>are</b> often housed in temples and Shinto shrines or in an adjacent museum or treasure house.|$|E

5000|$|The {{decoding}} step proceeds column-wise (i.e. by item). If every test {{in which}} an <b>item</b> appears <b>is</b> positive, then the <b>item</b> <b>is</b> declared defective; otherwise the <b>item</b> <b>is</b> assumed to be non-defective. Or equivalently, if an item appears in any test whose outcome <b>is</b> negative, the <b>item</b> <b>is</b> declared non-defective; otherwise the <b>item</b> <b>is</b> assumed to be defective. Of particular note {{here is that this}} algorithm never creates false negatives, though a false positive occurs when all locations with ones in the j-th column of [...] (corresponding to a non-defective <b>item</b> j) <b>are</b> “hidden” by the ones of other columns corresponding to defective items.|$|R

Artists such as Henry Hargreaves have deep-fried replicas of electronic items such as iPads, Game Boys, and laptops.|$|E
5|$|Sales are {{primarily}} derived from branded ice cream parlors, quick-serve restaurants, {{and the distribution}} of its pre-packaged items to convenience stores, food service operators such as schools, hospitals, prisons, military installations, sports stadiums, amusement parks, and assisted living centers. Pre-packaged <b>items</b> <b>are</b> also sold in regional supermarkets, but this accounts for a minority of the company's sales.|$|E

50|$|The {{first stage}} was a {{deductive}} approach and involved developing a large pool of items. 245 new <b>items</b> <b>were</b> {{generated by the}} authors in accordance with relevant personality research, reference materials, and the current diagnostic criteria. These <b>items</b> <b>were</b> then administered to 449 clinical and non-clinical participants. The number of <b>items</b> <b>was</b> reduced based on a rational approach according to {{the degree to which}} they fit Millon's evolutionary theory. <b>Items</b> <b>were</b> also eliminated based on simplicity, grammar, content, and scale relevance.|$|R

5|$|Three {{of the six}} prion {{species have}} bills filled with lamellae, which act as filters to sift {{zooplankton}} from the water. Water is forced through the lamellae and small prey <b>items</b> <b>are</b> collected.

5|$|Because of Monitors {{advanced}} state of deterioration, timely recovery of remaining significant artifacts and ship components became critical. Numerous fragile artifacts, including the innovative turret and its two Dahlgren guns, an anchor, steam engine, and propeller, have been recovered. They were transported back to Hampton Roads to the Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Virginia, {{where they were}} treated in special tanks to stabilize the metal. It is reported {{that it will take}} about ten years for the metal to completely stabilize. The new USS Monitor Center at the Mariners' Museum officially opened on March 9, 2007, and a full-scale copy of USS Monitor, the original recovered turret, and artifacts and related <b>items</b> <b>are</b> now on display.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{that employ}} many {{strategies}} to obtain food or feed {{on a variety}} of food <b>items</b> <b>are</b> called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programmes.|$|E
5|$|Characters can equip weapons, armor, rings, and amulets, {{which provide}} attack or defense points, or give bonuses {{to some other}} statistic. There are also usable items such as potions to restore a character's health or mana. Weapons, armor, and other <b>items</b> <b>are</b> found by killing enemies, {{breaking}} containers, or by purchase from vendors. Each character has an inventory, represented as a fixed grid, with each item depicted by a shape taking up spaces on the grid. One character type, the mule, cannot use weapons or magic, but has a much larger inventory.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} <b>items</b> <b>are</b> {{in short supply}} in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, {{the date of the}} Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E
