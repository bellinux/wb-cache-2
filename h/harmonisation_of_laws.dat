In that obscure field he became quite distinguished for his skill, even attracting the attention of the CARICOM secretariat, who consulted with him on the issue of <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws.</b> He further took up the position of Commissioner for Law Review, in which capacity he compiled nine volumes of The Laws of Belize, Revised Edition, published in 2000.

The dissertation examines the role of regional and sub-regional laws in this regard in an effort to ascertain whether there is sufficient legal certainty and <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> for environmental regulation. No specific law currently exists in South Africa regarding the regulation of dangerous goods transportation, rather the regulation of dangerous goods is effected by a multiplicity of laws. This state of affairs illustrates the difficulty that exists and may be associated with the enforcement of the regulation of dangerous goods transportation. Despite this, the multiple laws vividly elucidate the fact that there is a considerable degree of environmental protection vis-a-vis dangerous goods transportation premised on the fact that all environmental impacts could never be avoided or eliminated, but can be reduced to an extent.

40|$|Uncertainty, {{linguistic}} or otherwise, {{may lead}} to legal disputes. More complications are likely to arise when more than one language is involved. Inter-lingual uncertainty such as ambiguity, vagueness and other meaning indeterminacy {{is an area that}} has not received sufficient attention, in particular with regard to language used in law. This essay focuses on inter-lingual uncertainty with specific reference to legislative texts. It identifies three sources of gap in meaning in bilingual and multilingual laws, and discusses how the courts in Canada, Hong Kong and the European Court of Justice approach and construe meaning in such cases of linguistic uncertainty. It argues that judicial interpretation in the case of linguistic uncertainty is unique and is constrained by established laws, statutory interpretive rules, policy and other considerations. This is particularly the case for bilingual and multilingual law for the reconciliation of legal meanings and <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws.</b> The court has to resolve linguistic uncertainties to provide the uniform interpretation that the law requires. This has implications for the study of legal language, legal translation and pragmatics. Arts, Education & Law Group, School of Languages and LinguisticsNo Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the existing 38 commercial {{laws of the}} Maldives based on the benchmark set out in Article 10 of the Maldives‟ Constitution 2008 : the confirmation of the tenets of Islam. This benchmark represents a constitutional standard that all laws in the Maldives are required to meet. Thus, this thesis aims to identify those laws, and/or provisions, within the Maldives‟ commercial legislations that remain contrary to the benchmark {{with the objective of}} seeking out, and ultimately suggesting, law reforms in order to fully accommodate the tenets of Islam. The study adopts a qualitative method along with content analysis and various informal interviews with Maldivian Islamic scholars, lawmakers and lawyers etc. The key elements of Islamic commercial law contain the prohibition of riba(usury), gharar (uncertainty) and mysir (gambling), all of which stand as the basic tenets of Islam in relation to commerce. Additionally, these laws must comply with the general tenets of Islam such as the prohibition of any form of business and trade in liquor, pork and pornography etc. To accommodate these tenets, this thesis tested various Islamic commercial reform models, i. e Islamisation and <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> with reference to Shari‘ah.

40|$|Objective To explore social equity, health planning, {{regulatory}} and ethical dilemmas {{in responding to}} a pandemic influenza (H 5 N 1) outbreak, and the adequacy of protocols and standards such as the International Health Regulations (2005). Approach This paper analyses the role of legal and ethical considerations for pandemic preparedness, including {{an exploration of the}} relevance of cross-jurisdictional and cross-cultural perspectives in assessing the validity of goals for <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> and policies both within and between nations. Australian and international experience is reviewed in various areas, including distribution of vaccines during a pandemic, the distribution of authority between national and local levels of government, and global and regional equity issues for poorer countries. Conclusion This paper finds that questions such as those of distributional justice (resource allocation) and regulatory frameworks raise important issues about the cultural and ethical acceptability of planning measures. Serious doubt is cast on a ‘one size fits all’ approach to international planning for managing a pandemic. It is concluded that a more nuanced approach than that contained in international guidelines may be required if an effective response is to be constructed internationally. Implications The paper commends the wisdom of reliance on ‘soft law’, international guidance that leaves plenty of room for each nation to construct its response in conformity with its own cultural and value requirements...|$|E

Development of audit methods and improvement of audit control are being characterised as priorities in accordance with International audit standards. This reform aspect represents also an obligation of Bosnia and Herzegovina defined by the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. In order to provide support to candidate countries in their association process with their reform system of public internal control, the European Commission has developed a concept of public internal financial control.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore the need for, and the legal implications <b>of,</b> harmonising labour <b>laws</b> in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Chapter One highlights a number of factors that call for the <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>laws</b> in the SADC region and discusses some of the reasons why labour laws are not well developed in the region. The influence of globalisation on labour standards in southern Africa and the influence of regionalism on the <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>laws</b> are discussed at length. The inference that could be drawn from this discussion is that for a regionalisation process in southern Africa to be successful, there is an urgent need to harmonise the region’s labour law system. This thesis confirms that Southern Africa has many lessons to learn from the regional <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>law</b> in the European Economic Community and the current European Union. The implementation of international labour standards in southern Africa is investigated. The main areas examined include (1) freedom of association, (2) collective bargaining, (3) forced labour and (4) discrimination. The findings of this investigation show that there is no uniformity in the implementation of International Labour Organisation (ILO) standards in the SADC region and, therefore, it is recommended labour law should be harmonised in terms of ILO standards. In respect of the benefits to be derived from the harmonisation process, an empirical investigation was conducted in the SADC region and the following is recommended: the <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>law</b> in the SADC region will help with the implementation of ILO standards, protection of workers against the economic power of employers in the workplace and maintaining similar benefits for migrants in the region.

40|$|The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) {{represents}} {{the most significant}} step towards the advancement of children’s rights globally. Article 4 of the UNCRC requires states to take concrete measures to ensure the <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> relating to children with the Convention’s substantive provisions, including legislative and administrative measures. A similar duty prevails under the regional treaty, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child (ACRWC). Angola is the most recent example of an African country which has enacted a children’s statute to bring domestic law in line with international law requirements. The traditional link between children’s rights and family law is evident in many UNCRC and ACRWC requirements. These include: the child’s right to know and be cared for by both parents who shall bear responsibility for the upbringing {{and development of the}} child (UNCRC, art 18 (1) and ACRWC, arts 19 and 20); the child’s right not to be separated from his or her parents against their will unless so determined by competent authorities (UNCRC, art 9 (1); ACRWC, art 19 (2)); the right of a child who is separated to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents (UNCRC, art 9 (2); ACRWC, art 19 (3)), and the child’s right to protection from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation including sexual abuse, whilst in the care of parents, legal guardians or any other person who has the care of the child (UNCRC, art 19 (1); ACRWC, art 16 (1)) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the laws of Seychelles in terms of their genesis, evolution and status today. While all legal traditions are hybrids, so-called mixed legal systems where laws are explicitly the product of different traditions, provide a unique perspective on the process of the movements and mixing of laws. In the Seychellois national language, kreol, a mÃ©tis is someone of mixed parentage. This mÃ©tissage of race, culture and language is parallelled in its legal system. These small islands, {{in the middle of the}} Indian Ocean, colonised twice, combine French and English legal ideas in a non-Western setting. Recently, the world recession has brought new challenges in the form of a third wave of quasi colonisation with the bail out of struggling economies, including Seychelles, by financial bodies like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund which, as part of the aid packages, impose homogenous common law style legislation. The research is a comparative analysis of the Seychellois legal tradition. Seychelles is also, given its small size, one of many micro-jurisdictions around the world. As with mixed systems, such small legal orders provide important information for general legal theory. The thesis adds to the understanding of both mixed and micro-jurisdictions, and as a result, allows a reconsideration of the relevance of both to comparative law. It permits an examination of the utility of contemporary legal taxonomies, rooted in Western experiences, to non-European, post-colonial jurisdictions. The Seychellois experience may have important lessons for legal transplantation, reception and <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> as well as relevance for colonialism (including neo colonialism) and culture and for the viability and sustainability of such mixed systems of law. 2016 - 09 - 1...|$|E
40|$|Taxes will fulfil their {{function}} in economy adequately when and only {{they are in}} conformity {{with the principles of}} a market economy, and in particular with the freedom of economic activity and free competition rules. Therefore the implementation of external elements such as taxes into the economic mechanism must be properly integrated with that mechanism. On the microeconomic scale, taxation rules should, above all, conform with the principle of the ability of a tax payer to perform the obligation, i. e. the subjects on whom the tax obligation has been imposed must be capable of fulfilling that obligation. Further, the influence of national economies must be recognised, which is of particular significance in the European Union where tax harmonisarion {{is one of the key}} elements of the overall <b>harmonisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>laws</b> of its member states. From the legal aspect, the tying of taxes to economy manifests itself mainly in the relations between tax law and civil law. A reasonable legislator should attempt to ensure a compromise between the interest of the State Treasury and the cohesion and completeness of the legal system ensuring that institutions formed and regulated according to the procedures of the civil law code can function in a manner not disrupted or hindered by tax law. In the exercising the objectives of the legislation policy and selecting legislative techniques, it is necessary to account for the fact that tax law operates within an area of natural economic activities phenomena and that the legal regulations must be very precise and clear. Another important element of proper legislation procedure is accounting for potential conflicts of interests of different groups subjected to a given legislation, and providing for compromises to alleviate their such potential conflicts...|$|E
