25|$|Standard {{equipment}} for 1953 included bumper guards, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, chrome moldings, twin interior sun visors, rear seat robe rails, special rear stainless steel trim, chrome window ventiplanes, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with <b>horn</b> <b>ring.</b> In 1953 a padded safety dash also became standard on the 98. For {{the first time}} air conditioning was an option.|$|E
25|$|Interiors were revised with all-new {{instrument}} panels featuring a larger dose of walnut trim which now {{extended to the}} center console standard with bucket seats, along with a new steering wheel with horn bars replacing the <b>horn</b> <b>ring</b> used in previous years. The standard bucket seats could be upholstered either in expanded Morrokide vinyl or a new cloth-and-Morrokide trim. New for 1965 was a no-cost bench seat option with center armrest available with either upholstery choice.|$|E
2500|$|A revised {{instrument}} panel was highlighted {{by a new}} deep-dish steering wheel with [...] "horn bars" [...] replacing the long-standing <b>horn</b> <b>ring</b> still common during that period.|$|E

5000|$|The age {{of cattle}} is {{determined}} chiefly by {{examination of the}} teeth, and less perfectly by the <b>horn</b> <b>rings</b> or {{the length of the}} tail brush; however due to bang-tailing, which is the act of cutting the long hairs {{at the tip of the}} tail short to identify the animal after management practices, the latter is least reliable.|$|R
2500|$|The 1968 models {{featured}} additional safety features, including {{side marker}} lights and shoulder belts on cars built after December 1, 1967. The 1967 model's large steering wheel hub {{was replaced by a}} soft [...] "bar" [...] spoke that ran though the diameter of the wheel (and like the 1967 style, was used throughout the Ford Motor Company line). A plastic <b>horn</b> <b>ring</b> was also featured.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, {{a revised}} {{instrument}} panel featured a [...] "Mirromatic" [...] speedometer {{for which the}} lens could be adjusted to better visibility to suit the driver. A new two-spoke steering wheel with horn bars was introduced, replacing the time honored <b>horn</b> <b>ring</b> then still common to most automobiles. Brisbane cloth interiors graced closed models while the convertible was trimmed in leather. Convertibles also had a two way power seat adjuster and power windows standard.|$|E
2500|$|Drivers faced {{a highly}} stylized {{steering}} wheel with a double-delta shaped <b>horn</b> <b>ring</b> which framed {{the view of}} an unusual [...] "slot-machine" [...] speedometer, which consisted of a stationary horizontal [...] "needle" [...] and a vertically rotating black drum on which the numerals were printed in white. The numerals descended behind the needle as the vehicle gained speed. All other gauges, indicators and controls were grouped within fairly easy reach of the driver.|$|E

Up to two years, there are thicker transverse rings, of greater length and flexion than in adults. Into adulthood, thinner <b>horn</b> <b>rings</b> force the thick transverse rings upward. Growth increment slows earlier in maturation in females than in males. Researchers use genitalia and sexual behaviour to distinguish the sexes. Females have two pairs of mammae.|$|R

The 250- and 300-horsepower 364-cubic-inch V8s were continued from 1959, but a new no-cost option was a 235-horsepower lower-compression two-barrel version of the 364 with a lower compression ratio to permit use of regular-grade gasoline instead of the premium fuel required with all other Buick engines.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954, Oldsmobiles were {{redesigned}} {{across the}} line, with a three body style 98 series at the top. Convertibles were dubbed Starfires, after the previous year's Starfire dream car. A slightly higher horsepower [...] Rocket V8 was {{shared with the}} Super 88 series. Standard 98 equipment included bumper guards, rubber simulated carpets front and rear, electric clock, lined trunk, dual horns, cigarette lighter, aluminum door sill plates, turn signals, chrome rocker panel moldings, deck lid ornament, foam rubber seat cushions, padded dash, parking brake light, courtesy light package, stainless steel wheel discs, windshield washer, and Deluxe steering wheel with <b>horn</b> <b>ring.</b> Upholstery choices were nylon and leather, {{in a variety of}} colors.

2500|$|In 1952 the 98 {{remained}} {{as the top}} of the line Oldsmobile. The series shared the higher output 160 HP Rocket V8 with the Super 88s.

Another new option was the Autronic Eye, an automatic headlight dimmer, which in its initial year was shared only with Cadillac.|$|E
60|$|Whilst {{time was}} thus {{creeping}} on, the exiled glover {{had not even}} once set eyes upon his former apprentice. The care that was taken to attend to his wants and convenience in every respect showed {{that he was not}} forgotten; but yet, when he heard the chieftain's <b>horn</b> <b>ringing</b> through the woods, he usually {{made it a point to}} choose his walk in a different direction. One morning, however, he found himself unexpectedly in Eachin's close neighbourhood, with scarce leisure to avoid him, and thus it happened.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, all {{push-button}} transmission selectors {{became a}} safety issue {{due to lack}} of industry-wide standardization. In addition, since the 1920s the center of the steering wheel had typically held the horn button. While some cars of the late 50s had <b>horn</b> <b>rings,</b> some drivers instinctively hit the steering wheel center in an emergency, sometimes causing them to either damage the controls or cause an unexpected, hazardous gear change (occasionally causing transmission damage). The Edsel's system included an electro-hydraulic inhibitor switch activated by transmission fluid pressure which virtually eliminated the possibility of this happening.|$|R
50|$|Town hall's clock {{has been}} working {{continuously}} since 1901. ist constructor was a resident of Slupsk, and his name was OTTO PILA. The chimes were added to clock in 1973 (one phrase of Karol Szymanowski's IV Symphony). The load of the clockwork amounts to 36 kg and it is at most 2 seconds slow per day. In 1998 the resident of Slupsk, Jacek Stańczyk, composed town's bugle-call. Every day at midday, the recording of the call, performed by musicians of Polish Philharmonic Sinfonia Baltica, Jerzy Lis, Jan Buczko and Mieczysław Gach (trumpet and 2 French <b>horns)</b> <b>rings</b> out from the town hall's tower.|$|R
2500|$|The 98 {{topped the}} Oldsmobile line again for 1951 with Three body styles available. The 4-door sedan and {{convertible}} came only with Deluxe equipment, while the Holiday hardtop was available with either Deluxe or Standard trim. The 98 standard equipment included bumper guards, cigarette lighter, dome light, rubber floor mats, stainless steel moldings, lined trunk, illuminated ashtray, foam rubber seat cushions and extra chrome moldings. Deluxe equipment was special rear door ornament, rear center armrests, Deluxe electric clock, Deluxe steering wheel with <b>horn</b> <b>ring</b> and special chrome trim. Upholstery choices were nylon cord, nylon cloth and leather. The pillared Club coupe {{was no longer}} offered. With the only choice in a closed 2-door 98 now being the hardtop, Holiday sales nearly doubled to 17,929 units.|$|E
2500|$|Motor Trend {{magazine}} {{gave the}} Bel Air top marks for handling. Popular Mechanics reported acceleration for a V8 Bel Air with Powerglide as being 0-60mph in 12.9 seconds, plus a comfortable ride, and good visibility. On the other hand, the <b>horn</b> <b>ring</b> blocked {{some of the}} speedometer, regular gasoline made the engine knock, and the first V8 engines off the line burned too much oil. Front legroom was 43.1". Brakes were 11" [...] drums. A new option for V8-equipped 1955 models was air conditioning, with outlets {{on each side of}} the dashboard; a heavy-duty generator was included on cars equipped with this option; in 1955 and 1956, air conditioning could be installed on cars ordered with the standard three-speed manual transmission, overdrive or Powerglide, but from 1957 onward, an automatic transmission (or minus that, 4-speed manual transmission) was a pre-requisite option.|$|E
2500|$|For 1967, the 7 Litre model {{no longer}} carried the Galaxie name; {{it was to}} be the last year of it being {{separately}} identified. That identification was mainly trim such as <b>horn</b> <b>ring</b> and dashboard markings as well as the [...] "Q" [...] in the Vehicle Identification Number. The 7 Litre for 1967 was a trim and performance option on the Ford XL, which was now a separate model as well. Little else changed, except for trim and the styling; the same engines were available, from the 240 cu. inch six-cylinder to the 428 cu. inch V8. Modifications to the styling included adding a major bend {{in the center of the}} grille and making the model less [...] "boxy" [...] than the 1966 model. [...] An 8-track tape cartridge player became an option. Back-up lights were standard.|$|E

2500|$|Bel Air {{interiors}} had {{an optional}} massive expanse of chrome across {{the lower part}} of the dashboard (most were painted), along with a deluxe Bel Air steering wheel with full chrome <b>horn</b> <b>ring.</b> Carpeting and full wheel covers rounded out Bel Air standard equipment. For 1954, the Bel Air stayed essentially the same, except for a revised grille and taillights, and a revised engine that had insert bearings and higher oil pressure, needed for the full-flow oil filtration system that was not available prior to 1954. [...] Prior to 1954, the 235 and 216 cubic inch six cylinder engines had babbit bearings and scoops to create oil pressure at the bottom of each rod and the oil pressure was standard at 15-30 PSI. During these years, there were three engine choices, depending on the transmission ordered. Both 235 cubic inch engines were [...] "Blue Flame" [...] inline six cylinder OHV engines, featuring hydraulic valve lifters (in 1953 with automatic transmissions) and aluminum pistons. The [...] 235 cubic inch displacement engine was standard on stickshift models, with solid lifters and splash plus pressure lubrication including babbit bearings. Powerglide cars got a [...] version which had hydraulic lifters and full pressure lubrication.|$|E
2500|$|In 1955 the Oldsmobile 98 again had {{a longer}} {{wheelbase}} than the 88. Standard equipment included turn signals, bumper guards, stainless steel molfings, dual horns, cigarette lighter, {{front and rear}} floor mats, inside rearview mirror, foam rubber seat cushions, stainless steel rocker panel moldings, front seatback robe cord, spun glass hood insulation, rear window ventiplanes, electric clock, stainless steel wheel discs, custom cushion lounge seats front and rear, hand brake light, courtesy light package, padded dash, Deluxe steering wheel with <b>horn</b> <b>ring,</b> and windshield washer. Upholstery choices were covert and pattern cloth, leather and pattern cloth, leather and nylon, and leather and dimple leather. Standard tire size was [...] by [...] The optional air conditioning unit {{was moved to the}} engine bay instead of the trunk. The turning diameter was 43ft. The Hydramatic automatic transmission gear selector had an S on it, which was used for better performance climbing hills. At mid-year, Olds introduced the new pillarless four-door hardtop body, dubbed the Holiday sedan, in the 98 series. The 4-door Oldsmobile 98 Holiday, along with the 4-door 88 Holiday and the 4-door Buick Century Riviera and 4-door Special Riviera, were the first 4-door hardtops ever produced. Perhaps because of the popularity of the new 4-door hardtop body style total 98 sales set a new record of 118,626.|$|E

2500|$|Models were molded in {{different}} colors, but often painted with actual factory paints, {{a practice that}} {{went back to the}} 1930s. Also, as with the 1964 Pontiac Grand Prix, the roof was cast in [...] "vinyl" [...] black. Script and emblem details were intricately molded into plastic bodies, grilles and wheels. Hoods did not open, there was no engine detail and no interiors on most models in the 1950s. Thus promos without interior or engine detail were called “coaster models” as opposed to kits with more detail. With the development of kits, however, viewing the interior became practical and as important as exterior appearance. Speedometer numbers could be read on the instrument panels. <b>Horn</b> <b>rings</b> on the steering wheels were accurately depicted brand by brand.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{slightly}} upscale Bel Airs, Biscaynes are easily {{identified by the}} use of two taillights per side; the only exceptions to this were in 1959 and 1972. The more expensive Impalas (and later Caprices) have three taillights per side. The Biscayne was largely devoid of exterior chrome trim and was normally fitted with small hubcaps, though several exterior trim pieces and upgraded wheel covers were available at extra cost. Interior trim was spartan, with lower-grade cloth and vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery trim, a standard steering wheel with center horn button, and rubber floor mats. Slight upgrades were made throughout the life of the series — for instance, the 1964 models came standard with deluxe steering wheels with <b>horn</b> <b>rings,</b> deep-twist carpeting and foam-cushioned front seats.|$|R

50|$|Early 1970 models {{built from}} the {{introduction}} in April until August 1969 {{had a few}} interior features that the later 1970 models built from September 1969 onward did not. The earliest Mavericks featured a two-spoke steering wheel with a partial <b>horn</b> <b>ring</b> that was also found on other 1969 Fords, while the cars built in the 1970 model year had a revised steering wheel with no <b>horn</b> <b>ring.</b> Also, the early models featured the ignition switch in the instrument panel while the cars built after September 1, 1969 had the ignition switch mounted on a locking steering column, as did all other 1970 Fords in compliance with a new federal safety mandate that took effect with the 1970 model year.|$|E
60|$|As the French {{came on the}} Portuguese on {{the high}} ground {{remained}} silent and unnoticed, but when a flash of fire ran across the road and a deadly volley was poured in upon the enemy, those on the flanks at once opened fire.

The colonel and several other officers who had been at its head had fallen; in the din no orders could be heard, and for some minutes {{the head of the}} column wasted away under the rain of bullets.
