5|$|The {{work was}} carried out in an <b>empty</b> <b>room</b> of Okada's house where their {{business}} was also operated. While other people were present, the work was shared and Anno, Akai and Yamaga worked full-time on the production, the direction was not professional, but Takeada attributed Okada as the producer, with Yamaga directing, Akai doing character animation and Anno as the mecha animator. Takeada also said other individuals were involved and were used to trace cels or paint cels as needed, but still credits Yamaga, Akai and Anno with the production itself. Filming was done by a camera on a tripod and frames were called out by Anno because the production lacked timing sheets.|$|E
5|$|As other {{scenes of}} Carey in the latex mini {{and by the}} large red hone prop are interspersed, the club scene alters to a poker table, where Ealy reveals three of his card, '556', {{completing}} four of the seven digits of Carey phone number. The next scene finds Carey sitting on a large pink sofa in an <b>empty</b> <b>room</b> in the club, sporting only a white man's suit jacket and stilettos. As the song reaches the bridge, Carey is shown back in the club's main room dancing, as she leaves a number '4' on a nearby table for the man to find. As Carey once again {{is shown in the}} yellow latex dress, she walks down a small aisle, placing another card with the number '4' into Ealy's jacket pocket, before storming through the club by several followers. As the video ends, the number '555-6464' are shown lying on a small table, while Carey sits on the large pink sofa, and Ealy is seen on the other side gazing at her. The video concludes with Ealy slowly approaching Carey on the large sofa, as she winks and smiles to the camera.|$|E
5|$|One of the Techniques {{most popular}} {{features}} is the Sliver Box, an analogue of the Vent {{feature of the}} Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which allows readers to submit any comment they wish. Comments are submitted on the Techniques website and as many Slivers that will fit appear in the week's paper, usually in order of submission. Slivers are subject to minimal censorship, with only full names of non-public figures, personal information and strong profanities typically removed or altered. Other entries are occasionally removed or truncated, usually in cases of spamming of the Sliver submission system. According to the paper, the Box is used to fill <b>empty</b> <b>room</b> left between advertisements {{in order to maintain}} a modular layout style. It is not uncommon for students to have conversations using the Sliver Box. Slivers were originally comments made by editorial board members during deadline night and were placed in narrow boxes ("Slivers") at the bottom of each page. Comments made on deadline night and opinions of editorial board members still occasionally find their way into the Sliver Box.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} an <b>empty</b> <b>room</b> with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna holding to {{what looks like}} a baby, but is {{actually}} a big bag of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features a group of people of Asian heritage, who walk down a dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto the bag of water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on {{through the rest of the}} song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while someone is painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking and laughing towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black.|$|E
5|$|Leslie quickly seeks revenge against Lindsay {{by getting}} her parks {{employees}} to throw garbage over the Eagleton {{side of the}} fence. When Lindsay arrives to stop it, the two get into a fight amid the garbage bags. The police arrive and arrest both women: Lindsay is jailed in Pawnee, while Leslie is jailed in Eagleton's pristine and hotel-like holding cell. After Ann bails Leslie out, she tells her that Lindsay built the fence because she is jealous that Leslie was offered the Eagleton job first and wants to get a rise out of her. Ann suggests that Lindsay should be hit with a baseball bat, which gives Leslie the idea to turn Pawnee's side of Lafayette Park into a wiffle ball field, with the fence serving as the outfield wall. Lindsay is impressed by how fast Leslie turned the fence into something positive, and remembers why she and Leslie joined the parks department in the first place. With their relationship on the mend, the two agree {{to get a drink}} together. Later, Leslie returns to the office to throw Ron's party: she takes him to an <b>empty</b> <b>room</b> with steak, whiskey and his favorite movies waiting for him, and reveals that April and Andy's duties were false leads to trick him. Leslie explains she made a party that he would want and leaves a content Ron alone to enjoy his birthday.|$|E

25|$|The {{effective}} use {{of light and shadow}} to create mood also is central to Hopper's methods. Bright sunlight (as an emblem of insight or revelation), and the shadows it casts, also play symbolically powerful roles in Hopper paintings such as Early Sunday Morning (1930), Summertime (1943), Seven A.M. (1948), and Sun in an <b>Empty</b> <b>Room</b> (1963). His use of light and shadow effects have been compared to the cinematography of film noir.|$|E
25|$|Visitors {{enter the}} room after a short walk up a slight {{concrete}} incline, embossed with concrete squares. Inside visitors confront a low-hewn granite square, too empty to be a base, too short to be a table, but too square to be a tomb, in which the name John Fitzgerald Kennedy is carved. The letters have been painted gold to capture {{the light from the}} white floating column walls and the pale concrete floor. These words – three words of a famous name – are the only verbal messages in the <b>empty</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E

Thanks to an enormous publicity drive, 3,000 people queued up, waiting to be let into an <b>empty</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} factor in {{the sound of a}} loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's hands in a typical <b>empty</b> <b>room,</b> without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due both to a lack of absorption and to reverberation (that is, repeated echoes) from flat reflective walls, floor, and ceiling. The addition of hard surfaced furniture, wall hangings, shelving and even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes the echoes, primarily because of diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes and surfaces having sizes on the order of the sound wavelengths. This somewhat breaks up the simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces, and spreads the reflected energy of an incident wave over a larger angle on reflection.|$|E

The entire hue of this scene are in shades of red with interspersed scenes of the band slowly walking towards the camera. Muted color shots of each individual member interspersed the band scenes, with falling drapes, {{in the second half of}} the video. In the final moments of the video, the band stand in the center of the draped set, without any instruments, singing the final chorus of the song while yellow pansy petals fall on top of them. The scene switches to an empty shot of the draped room with falling yellow pansy petals before cutting to black.|$|E

First, he is seen {{in the middle of a}} virtual corridor in the same shiny grey suit he wears on the album cover. The second location is an attic, where he is sitting on a white sofa.

25|$|On February 3, {{in front}} of Ministry of Education {{headquarter}} in Naypyidaw, the students announced {{that they would be}} resuming their nationwide protests. Earlier that day, the government declared that the second quadripartite meeting was postponed after refusing to allow extra attendees who came along with the students to the meeting. During the meeting, Aung Min read out a letter, which he claimed to have just received from the president. The letter suggested that the meeting should be postponed and the government representatives decided to follow the president’s advice after a discussion. That early afternoon, the Ministry of Information released photos of government delegates standing in an <b>empty</b> <b>room</b> with a caption saying that the students did not show up to the meeting. Later that day, the government announced that the meeting would be postponed until February 12. The student leaders, meanwhile, declared that they have students ready to continue marching to Yangon from different parts of the country, including Mandalay in the north, Pathein in the southwest and Dawei in the south. On the same day, Aung San Su Kyi confirmed her opinions on the current protests, asking Thein Lwin to resign from his position in the central executive committee if he wanted to pursue his work with NNER. Initially silent on the topic, U Thein Lwin said in a press conference on February 3 that he would accept NLD's decision.|$|E

500|$|As Channel LP {{had little}} to do with the typical {{military}} contracts Sanders worked on, rather than bring the idea to his bosses Baer instead commandeered an <b>empty</b> <b>room</b> and assigned one of his technicians, Bob Tremblay, to work on it with him. By December 1966 an initial prototype later christened [...] "TV Game #1" [...] was completed, which could display and move a vertical line on a television screen. Baer demonstrated the prototype to the Sanders director of research and development, Herbert Campman, who hesitantly agreed to fund it for US$2,000 of labor and US$500 for materials, making it an official project.|$|E

In {{the script for}} [...] "Cathexis", Janeway's outfit included a crinoline and a corset. The space used {{for all of the}} holonovel scenes was dubbed [...] "the Jane Eyre set" [...] by the film crew. The story was compared to Henry James' novella The Turn of the Screw, and Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca. The story contained elements of mystery, such as [...] "music from a seemingly <b>empty</b> <b>room,</b> a locked fourth-floor door that Davenport/Janeway is forbidden to enter". The implication that the holonovel would end with Davenport's marriage to Lord Burleigh shifted the narrative so that it was [...] "more romantic than gothic".|$|E
