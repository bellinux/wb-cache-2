5|$|The Satake clan claimed {{descent from}} Satake Masayoshi, the {{grandson}} of the prominent 11th century warrior Minamoto no Yoshimitsu. Yoshimitsu received land in Mutsu Province and <b>Hitachi</b> Province {{as a reward for}} his military service, and took up residence at Satake village, in <b>Hitachi.</b> Yoshimitsu willed the territory around Satake village to his son, Yoshinobu. Yoshinobu, in turn, passed it on to his own son, Masayoshi. The Satake clan would remain in <b>Hitachi</b> until they were ordered to move in 1602. In 1106, Masayoshi led a rebellion against Minamoto no Yoshikuni, a power figure in neighboring Shimotsuke Province, but was defeated and killed by Yoshikuni, who followed him back to <b>Hitachi.</b> During the Genpei War, Masayoshi's son Takayoshi sided with Taira no Kiyomori. The Satake clan was defeated by Minamoto no Yoritomo in 1180, and its territory confiscated; it was not until nine years later that Yoritomo forgave Takayoshi's son Hideyoshi, and allowed Hideyoshi to become his vassal. Hideyoshi served in the attack on Mutsu Province. The Satake clan later returned to its old territory in <b>Hitachi.</b>|$|E

5|$|Development of the Saturn {{began in}} 1992, {{the same year}} Sega's {{groundbreaking}} 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted. Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company <b>Hitachi,</b> another video display processor was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation. The Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, known in development as Sonic X-treme, has been considered {{a factor in the}} console's poor performance.|$|E
5|$|Joined by Howe and re-designated Task Force 57, the British Pacific Fleet {{was again}} {{involved}} in operations in late March 1945, when it launched {{attacks on the}} Sakishimo-Gunto airfields, a task it repeated in early May. On 4 May 1945 King George V led battleships and cruisers in a forty-five-minute bombardment of Japanese air facilities in the Ryukyu Islands. As the Allies approached the Japanese homeland, King George V was dispatched in mid-July to join the US battleships in a bombardment of industrial installations at <b>Hitachi.</b> King George V fired 267 rounds from her 14-inch guns during this operation. The task force {{then moved on to}} Hamamatsu in southern Honshu, where it carried out a further bombardment of aviation factories. During the Okinawa campaign, the battleship supported four fast carriers of the British Pacific Fleet. Her last offensive action was a night bombardment of Hamamatsu on 29 and 30 July 1945.|$|E
