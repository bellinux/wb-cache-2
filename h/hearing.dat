5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} found with Nasodigitoacoustic syndrome {{can be managed}} or treated. Sensorineural <b>hearing</b> loss in humans {{may be caused by}} a loss of hair cells (sensory receptors in the inner ear that are associated with <b>hearing).</b> This can be hereditary and/or within a syndrome, {{as is the case with}} nasodigitoacoustic syndrome, or attributed to infections such as viruses. For the management of sensorineural <b>hearing</b> loss, <b>hearing</b> aids have been used. Treatments, depending upon the cause and severity, may include a pharmacological approach (i.e., the use of certain steroids), or surgical intervention, like a cochlear implant.|$|E

During the course of the <b>hearing,</b> Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers.

5|$|<b>Hearing</b> aids or {{cochlear}} implants {{may be used}} if the <b>hearing</b> loss is severe or prolonged. <b>Hearing</b> aids work by amplifying {{the sound}} of the local environment and are best suited to conductive <b>hearing</b> loss.

5|$|<b>Hearing</b> loss may {{be either}} partial or total. This {{may be a}} result of injury or damage, {{congenital}} disease, or physiological causes.

When deafness is a result of injury or damage to the inner ear, vestibulochoclear nerve, or brain, it is known as sensorineural <b>hearing</b> loss.|$|E

5|$|Noise as {{high volume}} {{is common for}} musicians from {{classical}} orchestras to rock groups as {{they are exposed to}} high decibel ranges. Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced <b>hearing</b> loss from their music, it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause <b>hearing</b> impairments. Music-induced <b>hearing</b> loss is still a controversial topic for <b>hearing</b> researchers.

5|$|The {{pinniped}} ear {{is adapted}} for <b>hearing</b> underwater, {{where it can}} hear sound frequencies at up to 70,000Hz.

One study of three species‚Äîthe harbor seal, California sea lion and northern elephant seal‚Äîfound that the sea lion was best adapted for airborne <b>hearing,</b> the harbor seal was equally capable of <b>hearing</b> in air and water, and the elephant seal was better adapted for underwater <b>hearing.</b> Although pinnipeds have a fairly good sense of smell on land, it is useless underwater as their nostrils are closed.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one out of}} one {{thousand}} children suffer some type of congenital deafness related {{to the development of}} the inner ear. Inner ear congenital anomalies are related to sensorineural <b>hearing</b> loss and are generally diagnosed with a computed tomography (CT) scan or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. <b>Hearing</b> loss problems also derive from inner ear anomalies because its development is separate from that of the middle and external ear. Middle ear anomalies can occur because of errors during head and neck development. The first pharyngeal pouch syndrome associates middle ear anomalies to the malleus and incus structures as well as to the non-differentiation of the annular stapedial ligament. Temporal bone and ear canal anomalies are also related to this structure of the ear and are known to be associated with sensorineural <b>hearing</b> loss and conductive <b>hearing</b> loss.|$|E
