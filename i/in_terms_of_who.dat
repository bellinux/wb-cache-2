5|$|Fine {{reckoned}} Lasker {{paid little}} attention to the openings, but Capablanca thought Lasker knew the openings very well but disagreed with a lot of contemporary opening analysis. In fact before the 1894 world title match, Lasker studied the openings thoroughly, especially Steinitz's favorite lines. He played primarily e4 openings, particularly the Ruy Lopez. He opened with 1.d4 relatively rarely, although his d4 games had a higher winning percentage than his e4 ones. With the Black pieces, he mainly answered 1.e4 with the French Defense and 1.d4 with the Queen's Gambit. Lasker also used the Sicilian Defense fairly often. In Capablanca's opinion, no player surpassed Lasker in the ability to assess a position quickly and accurately, <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> had the better prospects of winning and what strategy each side should adopt. Capablanca also wrote that Lasker was so adaptable that he played in no definite style, and that he was both a tenacious defender and a very efficient finisher of his own attacks.|$|E

Those who have secure residential status in both the home and host countries {{are better able to}} travel between the two without concern for legal status. <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> migrates, circular migrant workers {{are more likely to be}} male, have primary education, and come from more rural and less developed areas. Education, gender, age, and the reasons for return from the first migration all affect the choice of migration form. In addition, circular migration rates are high among the poor.|$|E
500|$|Orion {{was less}} {{resolute}} <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> they wanted {{for the role}} of Agent Alan Ward. After filming The Last Temptation of Christ (1988), Willem Dafoe expressed interest in playing Ward, and Parker traveled to Los Angeles, where he met with the actor to discuss the role. Dafoe was cast shortly thereafter. To prepare for the role, Dafoe researched the time period and Neshoba County. He also read Willie Morris's 1983 novel The Courting of Marcus Dupree, and looked at 1960s documentary footage detailing how the media covered the murder case. Frances McDormand plays Mrs. Pell, the wife of Deputy Sheriff Clinton Pell. On working with Hackman, McDormand said, [...] "...in Mississippi Burning, I didn't do research. All I did was listen to [...] He had an amazing capacity for not giving away any part of himself (in read-throughs). But the minute we got on the set, little blinds on his eyes flipped up and everything was available. It was mesmerizing. He's really believable, and it was like a basic acting lesson." ...|$|E

500|$|The Giro {{was often}} {{described}} as being wide open <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> had {{the best chance to}} win it. This is because many notable riders, including the past three champions, did not enter. 2007 Giro d'Italia champion Danilo Di Luca, who originally finished second in the 2009 Giro d'Italia, was suspended by his national federation in February for a doping incident in the 2009 Giro. 2008 Giro d'Italia champion Alberto Contador skipped the Giro to better focus on the Tour de France, as he also had in the previous season. After first indicating that he might defend his championship, 2009 champion Denis Menchov also announced that he would not ride the Giro, instead focusing on the Tour de France, in order to complete the career sweep of the Grand Tours. Lance Armstrong and Levi Leipheimer, leaders of the [...] squad in the 2009 Giro, announced in October 2009 that they would ride the partially concurrent Tour of California instead of the Giro, which is why [...] was not selected for the Giro.|$|E
500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E
2500|$|In {{determining}} {{the success or}} failure of a Dutch Auction, one must consider competing objectives. If the objective is to reduce risk, a traditional IPO may be more effective because the underwriter manages the process, rather than leaving the outcome in part to random chance <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> chooses to bid or what strategy each bidder chooses to follow. From the viewpoint of the investor, the Dutch Auction allows everyone equal access. [...] Moreover, some forms of the Dutch Auction allow the underwriter to be more active in coordinating bids and even communicating general auction trends to some bidders during the bidding period. Some have also argued that a uniform price auction is more effective at price discovery, although the theory behind this is based on the assumption of independent private values (that the value of IPO shares to each bidder is entirely independent of their value to others, even though the shares will shortly be traded on the aftermarket). [...] Theory that incorporates assumptions more appropriate to IPOs does not find that sealed bid auctions are an effective form of price discovery, although possibly some modified form of auction might give a better result.|$|E

2500|$|More men {{are realizing}} that work is not their only primary source of {{fulfillment}} from life. A new study on fatherhood (2010) shows that more men are looking for alternatives to their 40-hour workweek in order {{to spend more time}} with their family. [...] Though working less means a smaller paycheck and higher stress levels, men are looking for flexibility just as much as women. [...] However, with an ever-changing [...] society, flexibility is becoming much more apparent. [...] "It seems that some traditional stereotypes are starting to lessen just a bit <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>who’s</b> responsible for care of the children" [...] says human resource specialist Steve Moore. [...] Traditionalism is becoming less frequent due to what’s actually practical for each individual family.|$|R
