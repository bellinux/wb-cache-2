500|$|The group {{obtained}} a duplicate nuclear football and Gold Codes card, {{and kept it}} in the situation room. (Reagan's football was still with the officer at the hospital, and Bush also had a card and football.) The participants discussed whether to raise the military's alert status, {{and the importance of}} doing so without changing the DEFCON level, although the number of Soviet submarines proved to be normal. Upon learning that Reagan was in surgery, Haig declared, the [...] "helm <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>here.</b> And that means right in this chair for now, constitutionally, until the vice president gets here." [...] However, Haig made an inaccurate statement. As the sitting Secretary of State, he was fourth behind Vice President [...] Bush, [...] Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and President pro tempore of the Senate Strom Thurmond in the line of succession and, under , O'Neill and Thurmond would have had to resign their positions to become acting president. Although others in the room knew that Haig's statement was constitutionally incorrect, they did not object at the time to avoid a confrontation.|$|E

Two weeks prior to this deadline, the council had raised $31,750, more than $20,000 short of the asking price. In an interview published by The Oregonian, Nye said, [...] "Lee Kelly is a living legend and the pride of Oregon's artistic community. And his studio <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> in Clackamas County. He's a local treasure." [...] She also wrote in a press release, [...] "It would be a terrible loss to the community to have this sculpture removed, but it's fast becoming a reality". The council's board chair, Shari Newman, also stressed the urgent need for financial assistance, saying [...] "We’re more than halfway there, but what we really need is a handful of lead donors to step forward and make this important work a permanent part of the City’s collection. And we need them now." [...] During the final two weeks of the fundraising campaign, the council draped a black parachute over the sculpture and posted signs requesting financial assistance, such as [...] "Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, this sculpture is leaving... Let's hope it's not." ...|$|E

60|$|It <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>here</b> {{to remark}} that {{something}} of the pupil's return of courage and resolution was due to his quick perception. He had time to reflect that he really had been at, or near, {{the bottom of the}} sea--at all events over head and ears in water--for several minutes without being drowned, even without being moistened, and his faith in the diving-dress, though still weak, had dawned sufficiently to assert itself as a power.|$|E

60|$|Too {{late for}} use here came Vedic Mythology, from Grundriss der indo-arischen Philologie, {201} by Mr. A. Macdonell, the {{representative}} of the historic house of Lochgarry. This even a non-scholar can perceive to be a most careful and learned work. As to philological 'equations' between names of Greek and Vedic gods, Mr. Macdonell writes: 'Dyaus=[Greek] is the only one which can be said to be beyond the range of doubt.' As to the connection of Prometheus with Sanskrit Pramantha, he says: '[Greek] has every appearance of being a purely Greek formation, while the Indian verb math, to twirl, is found compounded only with nis, never with pra, to express the art of producing fire by friction.' (See above, p. 194.) If Mr. Macdonell <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>here,</b> the Greek myth of the fire-stealer cannot have arisen from 'a disease of language.' But scholars must be left to reconcile this last typical example of their ceaseless differences in the matter of etymology of names.|$|E
60|$|For {{these are}} formed {{for that very}} end, that they might hope in the Lord; yea, the word and {{testament}} are given to them for this purpose (Psa 78:5-7). These are prisoners of hope all {{the time they are}} in the state of nature, even as the whole creation is subjected under hope, all the time of its bondage, by the sin and villainy of man; and unto them it shall be said, in the dispensation of the fullness of time, 'Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope' (Zech 9:12); as certainly as that which is called the creature itself shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God (Rom 8:18-21). Only here, as I said before, let all men have a care in this thing: this is the pinnacle, the point; he that <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>here,</b> is right in all that is necessary to salvation; but he that misses here, can by no means be right anywhere to his soul's advantage in the other world.|$|E

"We have had," [...] he said, [...] "in the {{previous}} {{part of our}} duty" [...] (alluding to some former trials), [...] "to discuss crimes which infer disgust and abhorrence, while they call down the well-merited vengeance of the law. It is now our still more melancholy task to apply its salutary though severe enactments to {{a case of a}} very singular character, in which the crime (for a crime it is, and a deep one) arose less out of the malevolence of the heart, than the error of the understanding--less from any idea of committing wrong, than from an unhappily perverted notion of that which <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> <b>Here</b> we have two men, highly esteemed, it has been stated, in their rank of life, and attached, it seems, to each other as friends, one of whose lives has been already sacrificed to a punctilio, and the other is about to prove the vengeance of the offended laws; and yet both may claim our commiseration at least, as men acting in ignorance of each other's national prejudices, and unhappily misguided rather than voluntarily erring from the path of right conduct.|$|E
