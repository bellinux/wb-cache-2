5|$|The game's sound team {{consisted}} of ten people: five handling general sound design, and five handling music composition. Hajime Wakai acted as the game's sound director and lead composer, {{with the other}} composers being Shiho Fujii, Mahito Yokota, and Takeshi Hama. Longtime series composer Koji Kondo had a supervisory role, only composing a single piece by himself: the music accompanying the prologue video describing the mythical origins of Demise and Hylia. He also helped in arranging the other composer's pieces, using an electric piano and a Mac computer. Fujii {{was responsible for the}} music focused on environments, dungeons, boss battles: among her work was the music for Skyloft. She used art and environmental assets so that her compositions would fit in with their environments. A first for the Zelda series, the music was performed using a live orchestra rather than synthesized instruments. It was the first time Nintendo EAD had used a live orchestra. Any previous orchestral elements in Twilight Princess, which amounted only to one track, were handled by their Tokyo division. Due to his experience, the department's musical lead Yokota was brought on to help orchestrate the score. Aonuma initially <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> using an orchestra, and was still sure the score would remain synthesized even after Wakai asked him about it. An orchestra was finally chosen after Miyamoto insisted upon it, a decision which surprised the entire team.|$|E

Fox and Christopher Lloyd, who allowed their likenesses to be used for the in-game characters. Season designer and writer Michael Stemmle emphasized that the game's graphics would take a less realistic and more stylized approach while trying to stay true to the feel of the trilogy. The puzzles were designed to rely on applying items in the inventory to characters and objects as the developers <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Marty as a protagonist that would build a gadget from various parts.|$|E
5000|$|While chanting, {{keep your}} mind {{positive}} and sound bright. Your mindset {{and the manner}} in which you chant determine the kind of energy and spirit that responds to you. Taesabunim (Supreme Dao Master) teaches that when meditating, [...] "Do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> goodness. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> badness." [...] This is the nondiscriminating mind that allows a practitioner to become one with the universe. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> yourself as good or bad, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> others as good or bad, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> any phenomena as good or bad.

25|$|However, if no {{possible}} arrangement of ground conditions {{leads to the}} port conditions, the circuit might not behave the same way. The improvement factors (1 + βFB AOL) for determining input and output impedance might not work. This situation is awkward, because a failure to make a two-port may reflect a real problem (it just is not possible), or reflect a lack of imagination (for example, just <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> splitting the emitter node in two). As a consequence, when the port conditions are in doubt, at least two approaches are possible to establish whether improvement factors are accurate: either simulate an example using Spice and compare results with use of an improvement factor, or calculate the impedance using a test source and compare results.|$|E
500|$|After the Pagan studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly {{published}} {{a summary of}} Voigt's research, Anderson released an open letter dated to August 21, 1991, refuting many of Kelly's claims and referring to it as [...] "the stupid drivel {{of those who have}} only a shallow grasp of their alleged research." [...] He stated that contrary to Kelly's assertions, the Harpy Coven had worshiped a goddess, who was known as Lilith, and that [...] "we <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her as merely the Goddess, but as God Herself".|$|E

Emily, for example, succumbs to the temptation to eat some forbidden plums: “no eye was looking at her, but the eye of God, who sees every thing we do, and knows even the secret thoughts of the heart; but Emily, just at that moment, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> God." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{collection}} contains the first episodes in the series' mythology, or fictional story arcs. When the series began, Chris Carter <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> creating a [...] "mythology" [...] for the episodes focusing on extraterrestrial life, {{because he felt}} that [...] "they were just stories we wanted to tell". Eventually, however, the writers saw that the most [...] "personal" [...] episodes were those based on the government conspiracy, and, as such, developed more stories based around the conceit. Jerry Hardin, William B. Davis, Mitch Pileggi, Tom Braidwood, Dean Haglund and Bruce Harwood all play supporting roles in the collection. Released on June 7, 2005, the collection received generally positive reviews from critics.|$|E

500|$|... "Blurred Lines" [...] was controversial: its {{video was}} called sexist for its {{perceived}} degradation of women, and some felt its lyrics promoted rape. Others disagreed, {{asserting that the}} lyrics supported female power and sexual freedom. Martel defended Ratajkowski's performance, saying: [...] "it's very, very funny and subtly ridiculing." [...] Ratajkowski <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> the video as sexist and claimed that the producers, {{through the use of}} humor and sarcasm, [...] "took something that on paper sounded really sexist and misogynistic and made it more interesting". She said that the song [...] "gave me an opportunity to say the things that I felt about feminism today and about women in general in pop culture." [...] Ratajkowski did not feel objectified and enjoyed performing in a sexual manner: the attention given to the nudity in the video, she said, shows that America has not advanced as far as it should have, and, she believes, society represses sexuality, which is bad for both sexes.|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{became more}} [...] "politicized" [...] in The Heart of Woman, and {{developed}} {{a new sense of}} Black identity. McPherson argued that even Angelou's decision to leave show business was political, and regarded this book as [...] "a social and cultural history of Black Americans" [...] during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Angelou saw herself as a historian of both the Civil Rights movement and the Black literary movement of the time. She became more attracted to the causes of Black militants, both in the U.S. and in Africa, to the point of entering into a relationship with South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make, and became more committed to activism. She became an active political protestor during this period, but she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> herself in that way. Instead, the focus was on herself, and she used the autobiographical form to demonstrate how the Civil Rights movement influenced one person involved in it. According to Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and effective.|$|E
500|$|Naruto's romantic {{partner was}} decided {{during the early}} stages of the manga. Since Hinata Hyuga always {{respected}} Naruto, even before the series' beginning, even before Iruka Umino, Kishimoto felt they were meant to be. This angered his wife who wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno. When Sakura was introduced, Kishimoto <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> her as Naruto's future wife, as he saw them as being just friends and teammates, although once Hinata had appeared, the author thought of forming a love triangle between the three characters. He later regretted the love triangle as he considered Naruto a fighting series with little focus on romance, and he reiterated that [...] "it was all about Naruto and Hinata getting married from an early stage". Later, when seeing the staff's work to focus a film on Naruto's relationship with Hinata, he decided to oversee the project. Nevertheless, he enjoyed seeing Naruto and Hinata's romantical scenes he did not write. In regards to Naruto's rank which remains as the lowest one, Genin, due to Naruto spending most of his Part II's time fighting and training, Kishimoto decided Naruto would skip the following ranks to become the Hokage, which he felt was appealing.|$|E

500|$|Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg: The German army Colonel who was {{instrumental}} in the conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Bryan Singer saw von Stauffenberg as [...] "very much a humanist", saying, [...] "He understood his role as a colonel, but he also understood that the Nazis were doing terrible, terrible, terrible things." [...] Having directed Superman Returns, Singer compared von Stauffenberg's dual identity as loyal colonel and conspirator to Superman and his civilian identity Clark Kent. Cruise had wanted to work with Singer since they met at the premiere for , and the actor was enticed by the script's background, the truth of which struck him as a surprise. The actor described von Stauffenberg's heroism, [...] "I thought of it in terms of what [...] Stauffenberg represents. He was someone who realized that he had to take the steps that ultimately cost him his life.... He recognized what was at stake." [...] Cruise felt von Stauffenberg <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> himself as a hero. The actor prepared for the role for eight months by hiring a researcher, studying history books, and speaking with some of von Stauffenberg's family. Since von Stauffenberg lost his left eye, right hand and two fingers on his left hand in an Allied attack in Tunisia, Cruise affected the same disabilities to practice dressing, moving items and writing. Cruise initially found the eyepatch difficult to work with but acknowledged that von Stauffenberg had to live with this discomfort.|$|E
500|$|Though Hemmings <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> {{his work}} as a biography, Richard L. Hopkins (Comparative Education Review) said it {{essentially}} was strongest as one. Hopkins wrote in 1976 that Hemmings's book was the best biography of Neill available at the time, and called it [...] "comprehensive", [...] "objective", and [...] "sympathetically thoughtful". In comparison, Neill's autobiography [...] "rambles" [...] and Skidelsky's biography [...] "preens" [...] over [...] "small insights", while Hemmings unpacks larger issues to contextualize [...] "a complex man in a complex world". Reflecting on these three biographies of Neill, Hopkins added that Hemmings's book would interest [...] "comparative educators" [...] most, as that it addressed the two points readers would find most interesting about Neill: the role of his history on his ideas, and the role of his ideas in the outside world. Still, Hopkins thought many readers would find the work [...] "too long and detailed". Hopkins himself found Hemmings's book [...] "a struggle to work through", though more complete compared to Neill's [...] "easy", [...] "stream-of-consciousness" [...] prose. Leonard W. Cowie (British Journal of Educational Studies) said that Fifty Years was written with [...] "great competence" [...] and would be both [...] "interesting and essential" [...] for those interested in understanding Neill. [...] recommended the [...] "excellent volume" [...] for [...] "all readership levels", and considered it more telling than Neill's own autobiography. Shelley Neiderbach (Library Journal) agreed that Hemmings's [...] "admiring ... historical biography" [...] remained [...] "clear, cool, and evenhanded". [...] Sarah Curtis (The Times Literary Supplement) wrote in 1972 that Hemmings's account of Neill was [...] "the most lucid, dispassionate yet sympathetic" [...] published. No system, she wrote, has reconciled the needs for individual freedom and societal regulation.|$|E
500|$|Toriyama {{said that}} by {{the second half of}} the series, he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than drawing it, and that the battles became more intense by him simplifying the lines. He also said he would get letters from readers complaining that the art had become [...] "too square", so he intentionally made it more so. Years later he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborately, suggesting that he was not interested in the art. As the manga progressed, he struggled with the Android and Cell arc, feeling that the manga could not outdo the Freeza arc. He added time travel, but said he had a hard time with the plot, only being able to think of what to do that week. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for it and changed his mind. Even after the Cell arc, Toriyama felt it could not end there and so continued to the Majin Boo arc. Having resolved it would be the finale, he decided to draw what he wanted and inserted comedy with Gohan's Great Saiyaman persona and the character Gotenks. However, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> an ending until the final chapter. At the time, Toriyama said he gave Dragon Ball a low-key ending to make it seem as if the story might continue. But would later say he skipped 10 years ahead in the story to signal that it was truly the end. Wanting to make it clear that Goku's battles were over, and a new generation was taking over, Toriyama added a message to the ending for the kanzenban re-release of Dragon Ball which finished in 2004.|$|E

2500|$|The Herald {{published}} {{a story on}} May 3 that Hart had spent Friday night and most of Saturday with {{a young woman in}} his Washington, D.C. townhouse. On that same day, in an interview with E. J. Dionne that appeared in the New York Times, Hart, responding to the rumors of his womanizing, said: [...] "Follow me around. I don't care. I'm serious. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They'll be very bored." [...] The Heralds reporters at some point learned that the New York Times was planning to feature the story with the quote on Sunday, incorporated it into their story, and the two articles appearing on the same day ignited a political firestorm. On Sunday, Hart's campaign denied any scandal and condemned the Heralds reporters for intrusive reporting. [...] Hart later noted that his [...] "follow me around" [...] comment was not [...] "challenging the press with a taunt", but, made in frustration, was only intended to invite the media to observe his public behavior, and [...] never intended to invite reporters to be [...] "skulking around in the shadows" [...] of his home. [...] '“He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as a challenge,” Dionne would recall many years later. “And at the time, I <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it as a challenge.”' [...] Nor did Hart's comment influence the Miami Herald to pursue the story.|$|E
