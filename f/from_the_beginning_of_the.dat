40|$|BACKGROUND : Depression {{is common}} in primary care but is suboptimally managed. Collaborative care, that is, {{structured}} care involving a greater role of nonmedical specialists to augment primary care, {{has emerged as a}} potentially effective candidate intervention to improve quality of primary care and patient outcomes. METHODS : To quantify the short-term and longer-term effectiveness of collaborative care compared with standard care and to understand mechanisms of action by exploring between-study heterogeneity, we conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that compared collaborative care with usual primary care in patients with depression. We searched MEDLINE (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> 1966), EMBASE (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> 1980), CINAHL (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> 1980), PsycINFO (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> 1980), <b>the</b> Cochrane Library (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> 1966), and DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews <b>of</b> Effectiveness) (<b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> 1985) databases <b>from</b> study inception to February 6, 2006. RESULTS : We found 37 randomized studies including 12 355 patients with depression receiving primary care.

5|$|A {{number of}} other {{techniques}} developed in parallel {{with the use of}} daguerreotypes. The ambrotype, using collodium to produce a positive image on glass, and the pannotype, also collodium-based, were both used in Denmark from around 1855. Negative-based paper prints, used <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1850s, were produced on salt paper until around 1857 when salt was replaced by albumen. Collodion emulsion chloride paper was used from 1865 and in 1880 gelatin emulsion paper was introduced.|$|E

5|$|Between {{two thirds}} and three {{quarters}} of the population live in urban areas. Switzerland has gone from a largely rural country to an urban one in just 70 years. Since 1935 urban development has claimed as much of the Swiss landscape as it did during the previous 2,000 years. This urban sprawl does not only affect the plateau but also the Jura and the Alpine foothills and there are growing concerns about land use. However, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century, the population growth in urban areas is higher than in the countryside.|$|E
