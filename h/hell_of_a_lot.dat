500|$|Desolate North {{received}} mixed reviews. The album garnered positive {{reviews from}} a number of ezines, with comparisons to founders of the genre, such as Disembowelment. AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia, however, felt that Desolate North compared negatively with the efforts of more prominent bands, concluding that [...] "Celestiial could be a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> worse, but they could be much better, too." [...] Scott Seward of Decibel Magazine felt that the music compared well to similar bands, said that Anderson [...] "makes beautiful sounds out of the darkness that others would rather run from".|$|E
500|$|Farrell also starred {{that year}} in Triage, {{directed}} by Oscar-winning Bosnian screenwriter and director Danis Tanović, {{about the life}} of a war correspondent.

500|$|A Lesson in Romantics is {{considered}} a fan favorite. Daniel Thompson of Music Emissions wrote that: [...] "every song is spectacular on this album and is a potential hit." [...] Despite its eventual success and acclaim, A Lesson In Romantics received little attention from professional music critics. Reviewers noted the improved sound from the band's debut EP, Tales Told by Dead Friends. Joe DeAndrea from AbsolutePunk.net wrote that: [...] "after their unimpressive release of the EP Tales Told By Dead Friends in November, the band's back with their debut album that will surely become one of your most played of the Summer." [...] Sputnikmusic reviewer Adam Knott gave the album a score of 4.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> better" [...] than most pop punk records.|$|E
500|$|According to Davis, while 2K Games was {{supportive}} of Yager and [...] "took a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of risk with the project", they {{insisted that the}} game have multiplayer components to boost the sales. This was a decision that Yager thought would hurt the game. Davis described the project as a [...] "waste of money" [...] and a [...] "low-quality Call of Duty clone". The president of Darkside Game Studios, Hugh Falk, responded by calling Davis' opinion [...] "outlying". He added that Darkside participated in the project {{towards the end of}} the game's development cycle and that they had to revamp the entire multiplayer system within tight deadlines. Davis later claimed that his comments were not directed at Darkside Game Studios, and that he is satisfied with their final product after a long and troubled development cycle.|$|E
500|$|Director Rob Bowman {{was worried}} that the episode's monster would not appear [...] "scary" [...] and that the story would not be [...] "compelling". By {{utilizing}} unique camera angles and quick action Bowman {{was able to make}} the episode feel [...] "a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> better than [...] was afraid it might". The monster was created by special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich, a task he considered [...] "the single most difficult thing [...] did all season". The tentacles were created out of a combination of silicone and urethane to make them translucent, but give them a flexible feel. The [...] "octopus bite marks" [...] numbered in the hundreds and required 90 minutes to apply. The episode's title, [...] "Agua Mala", means bad water in Spanish. [...] Aguamala is also the slang name for the Portuguese Man o' War, a venomous jellyfish similar in form to the episode's primary antagonist.|$|E

"Glorified G", a song mocking gun enthusiasts, was {{inspired}} by an incident that involved Abbruzzese telling the band he had just bought two guns, which sparked a conversation about guns within the band.

500|$|Stan Love, Wilson's {{cousin and}} band manager, fired Landy in December 1976 when Landy doubled his fee. Landy remembered 15 Big Ones as [...] "the only major success" [...] the Beach Boys had in recent years; [...] "Brian and I did that together. Right after that, I {{had to leave}} the situation. ... I was {{interested}} in making Brian a whole human being; they [...] were interested in getting another album done in time for 1977." [...] In 1977, Wilson was asked if Landy had too much control; he said, [...] "I thought so, but there was nothing I could do about it and I eventually gave in to it.... control of my life legally through the commitment of my wife.... He definitely helped me. It cost over a hundred thousand dollars – he charged a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> per month." [...] Wilson then reported that Landy was replaced with a new doctor, Steve Schwartz. After several sessions with Wilson, Schwartz died in a camping accident, falling off a mountain to his death.|$|E
500|$|The anime {{adaptation}} received mixed reviews. Chris Beveridge of Mania.com {{praised the}} series' aesthetics.

[...] Stig Høgset of THEM Anime Reviews also noted the characters are [...] "generally pleasant to look at." [...] He described the adaptation's story as [...] "fairly straightforward and hardly difficult to follow," [...] but criticized it as [...] "basically written with a complete disregard for logic and common sense." [...] Høgset concluded by comparing Tayutama anime adaptation to Natsume's Book of Friends, stating that although the former is [...] "honestly trying to tell a decent story about the possible friendship between two different races ... does this a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> better." ...|$|E

500|$|GameSpot's Mc Shea {{considered}} the combat well-balanced between Infamous's slower pace and Infamous 2s frenetic action, and enjoyed Delsin's agility and power. Chris Carter of Destructoid {{considered the}} combat's simplicity its strength, finding Delsin easy {{to control and}} navigate the world. Edge were underwhelmed with the game's opening because of its [...] "skittish" [...] parkour, but noted that once Delsin gained powers and reached Seattle, the game became very fun. They felt that enemies were clever enough to make combat a fun challenge, and called the main missions [...] "for the most part well designed and generously proportioned". IGN's Ingenito enjoyed using Delsin's powers in combat, and called each set [...] "strong enough to hang an entire game on". He found upgrading Delsin's powers helped keep the combat fresh and made for good replay value. Philip Kollar of Polygon favored using neon power, but praised the balance and variety between all of them. He called the combat [...] "a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun".

500|$|... "Nisei" [...] {{received}} largely positive reviews. In {{a retrospective}} {{of the third}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Nisei" [...] was rated an A. The review noted that the episode contained [...] "lots of excitement for Scully", though it also described Mulder's plot thread as [...] "equally gripping". Writing for The A.V. Club, Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode an A-, calling it [...] "a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of fun". VanDerWerff described the cliffhanger ending as [...] "just phenomenal", and felt that the episode had [...] "the drive of a big-budget action film". However, he noted that it was becoming evident by this stage that the series' mythology was becoming [...] "too big to ever resolve wholly satisfactorily". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris noted that, despite the teaser and first act being [...] "promising enough", the episode [...] "slides downhill rapidly with a storyline that crosses the border into ludicrous." [...] Vitaris called the scene where soldiers kill prisoners [...] "a scene more disturbing than anything else previously seen on The X-Files." [...] Furthermore, she wrote that the final scene between Mulder and Scully was [...] "beautifully written and acted." ...|$|E
500|$|By March, {{they had}} {{finished}} recording the track, but {{felt that it}} was rather unfocused and needed something else. The band had been introduced to Ron Geesin via the Rolling Stones tour manager, Sam Cutler, and were impressed with his composition and tape editing capabilities, particularly Waters and Mason. Geesin was handed the completed backing tracks the band had recorded, and asked to compose an orchestral arrangement over the top of it while the band went on tour to the US. Geesin described the composing and arranging as [...] "a <b>hell</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of work. Nobody knew what was wanted, they couldn't read music …" [...] According to him, Gilmour came up with some of the melodic lines, while the pair of them along with keyboardist Richard Wright worked on the middle section with the choir. When it came to recording his work in June with the EMI Pops Orchestra, the session musicians present were unimpressed with his tendency to favour avant garde music over established classical works, and, combined with the relative difficulty of some of the parts, harassed him during recording. John Alldis, whose choir were also to perform on the track, had experience in dealing with orchestral musicians, and managed to conduct the recorded performance in place of Geesin.|$|E
