40|$|Reverse {{investment}} {{occurs when}} a direct investment enterprise (DIE) has acquired a financial claim on its direct investor (DI). There is a difference in treatment between those situations where the DIE holds less than 10 per cent of the ordinary shares or voting power of the DI and those where the DIE holds 10 {{percent or more of}} the ordinary shares or voting power of the DI. The directional principle only applies in the former case, so that where the DIE has a claim on its DI, it is recorded under direct investment in the reporting economy, resulting in the netting of the asset against the liability at the total level for direct investment in the reporting economy, (and vice versa under direct investment abroad).

40|$|Direct {{investment}} is {{the category of}} international investment that reflects the objective of an entity resident in one economy obtaining a lasting interest in an enterprise resident in another economy. The lasting interest implies {{the existence of a}} long-term relationship between the direct investor and the enterprise and a significant degree of influence by the investor on the management of the enterprise. Direct investment covers the cross-border transactions of entities that are in a direct investment relationship—in other words, direct investment covers the cross-border transactions with the subsidiaries, associates and branches either directly or indirectly owned by a direct investor, as well as the cross-border transactions among the affiliated group of direct investment enterprises.

40|$|This Coordinated Direct Investment Survey Guide {{has been}} {{prepared}} to assist economies in participating in the 2009 Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS). The CDIS is being conducted {{under the auspices of}} the IMF‘s Statistics Department across a wide range of economies. The survey is conducted simultaneously by all participating economies with respect to end-of-December 2009, uses consistent definitions, and encourages best practices in collecting data on foreign direct investment positions. The CDIS is thus a unique tool in capturing world totals and the geographic distribution of direct investment positions, thereby contributing to important new understandings of the extent of globalization, and improving the overall quality of direct investment data worldwide. A pragmatic strategy has been adopted in conducting the CDIS. The CDIS is fully consistent with the fourth edition of the OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment and the sixth edition of the IMF‘s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, but where these standards offer compilers a choice of methods (such as in identifying units that are in a <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>relationship),</b> this guide favors simplified methods over conceptually ideal methods for economies that do not have fully developed data collection and compilation systems in place.

40|$|This paper reviews how {{long-term}} {{relationships between}} firms and banks shape {{the structure and}} integration of banking markets worldwide. Bank relationships arise to span informational asymmetries that are endemic in financial markets. Firm-bank relationships not only entail specific benefits and costs for both the engaged firms and banks, but also directly affect the structure of banking markets. In particular, the sunk cost of screening and monitoring activities and the 'informational capital' collected by the incumbent banks may act {{as a barrier to}} entry. The intensity of the existing firm-bank relationships will determine the height of this barrier and shape the structure of international banking markets. For example, in Scandinavia where firms maintain few and strong relationships, foreign banks may only be able to enter successfully through mergers and acquisitions. On the other hand, Southern European firms maintain many bank relationships. Therefore, banks may consider entering Southern European banking markets through <b>direct</b> <b>investment.</b> Bank-FIRM <b>Relationships,</b> International Banking Markets,...|$|R
40|$|Foreign <b>Direct</b> <b>Investment</b> plays a very {{important}} role in the growth of the country. It is very much vital in the case of developing countries. A typical characteristic of these developing economies is the fact that these economies do not have the needed level of savings {{in order to meet the}} required level of investment needed to sustain the growth of the economy. In such cases, foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> plays an important role of bridging the gap between the available capital and the required capital. It plays an important role in the long-term growth of a country not only as a source of capital but also for enhancing competitiveness of the domestic economy through transfer of technology, strengthening infrastructure, raising productivity and generating new employment opportunities.

40|$|This paper asks {{a simple}} question: Did Wilfred Laurier’s dream {{of free trade}} with the United States, {{when it came to}} {{fruition}} in 1989, also impact on foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> (FDI) into Canada by US multinationals? This paper argues that the customary static econometric approach found in the FDI literature, along with the assumption that policy changes influence only the intercept term, are inadequate to address the question. Instead we introduce an innovative dynamic framework to support the testing of hypotheses on behavioural changes in the variables using a structural break framework. A key conclusion is that prior to signing the free trade agreement US FDI responded only to current growth in the Canadian economy, in a unitary fashion, and current exchange rate shifts. This can be described as a static relationship. The implementation of the free trade agreements between Canada and the USA increased the responsiveness of US FDI to growth in the Canadian economy by a factor greater than two. Furthermore, dynamics are found {{in the form of a}} lagged effect for changes in the growth in the Canadian economy and interest rate differentials. These conclusions challenge the dominant view, including that in official policy circles, that the free trade agreement had no impact on US firms’ FDI decisions in Canada.

Yet economists have not reached a clear consensus on a number of important questions such as the labor market impact of trade reform, the linkages between trade and foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment,</b> and the <b>relationship</b> between trade and growth.

Although many studies have shown a positive relationship between various measures of openness and growth, many nagging problems remain. Trade policy is almost never measured using the most obvious indicators [...] such as tariffs. In addition, many studies are plagued by serious econometric problems. The evidence on labor markets and trade reform is less extensive. Based on the studies to date, it appears that the unemployment and wage effects of trade reforms have generally been small. In the paper, we discuss the possibility that small wage and employment responses are due to labor market regulations. The paper concludes with an analysis of the linkages between trade policies and foreign investment flows. Our evidence suggests that trade reform has been accompanied by significant increases in investment inflows. ...|$|R
