This formula includes 833 adjustable parameters, 9 in the <b>gross</b> <b>term</b> and 824 in the shell terms.

40|$|A nuclidic {{mass formula}} {{composed}} of a <b>gross</b> <b>term,</b> an even-odd term and a shell term {{is presented as a}} revised version of the mass formula constructed by the present authors and published in 2000. The <b>gross</b> <b>term</b> has almost the same functional form as in the previous formula, but the parameter values in it are somewhat different. The even-odd term is treated more carefully, and a considerable improvement is realized. The shell term is exactly the same as the previous one; it was obtained using spherical single-particle potentials and by treating the deformed nucleus as a superposition of spherical nuclei. The new mass formula is applicable to nuclei with Z ≥ 2 and N ≥ 2. The root-mean-square deviation from experimental masses is 666. 7 keV, which is less than that of the previous mass formula, 689. 8 keV. Nuclear masses are important quantities to determine the ground state prop-erties and reactions.

5000|$|The {{power of}} the patriarchal society on her views is evident. The {{influence}} is exemplified in line 6, [...] "I am thy subject, conquered, bound to stand". Voicing her situation, Pamphilia feels subjected to male dominance. However, her desires are unclear on this matter because she says, [...] "behold I yield", (5) as if a declaration of her choice to the relations with Amphilanthus. The idea of free choice for women would be classified as a protofeminist thought because they were grossly oppressed and not allowed to think for themselves. Stephen Mullaney provides insight into the reason that Mary Wroth's work survived by stating, [...] "What comes to reside in a wonder-cabinet are, in the most reified sense of the phrase, strange things: tokens of alien cultures, reduced {{to the status of}} sheer objects, stripped of cultural and human contexts {{in a way that makes}} them eminently capable of surviving the period that thus produced them". This essay was first published in 1983 and was subsequently included as chap. 3 in Mullaney's extended study of The Place of the Stage: License, Play, and Power in Renaissance England. The social analysis of the survival of the oppressed writings comes from [...] "Strange Things, <b>Gross</b> <b>Terms,</b> Curious Customs". The treatment of women caused Pamphilia to question whether she even has a choice in who she loves (consent) or if that is determined by society (coercion). Her inability to differentiate in the poem is probably due to the subjugation of inferior treatment that she has experienced. Mullaney refers to this as being [...] "reduced to the status of sheer objects". She is forced to analyze if she is merely an object at the disposal of men. As a result, her ability to analyze, invoke higher level thinking, and even her personhood is examined.|$|E
5000|$|In recent times, Eurostat {{publishes the}} [...] "business {{investment}} rate" [...] (also called the [...] "gross investment rate of non-financial corporations") in its quarterly sector {{accounts for the}} EU27. This ratio is defined as gross fixed capital formation divided by gross value added, in other words the share of GFCF in gross product. It provides {{an indication of how}} much of the total factor income is reinvested in new fixed assets. Normally that ratio is about 20-23% of gross value-added. However, calling it the [...] "business investment rate" [...] or the [...] "gross investment rate" [...] is somewhat deceptive, since this indicator refers only to fixed investment, and more specifically, the net fixed investment (fixed assets bought, less disposals of fixed assets). The actual total funds which are spent by enterprises on investments, in <b>gross</b> <b>terms,</b> are much larger, both because enterprises invest in far more than fixed assets only (they also buy intermediate goods and services, and some financial assets), and because the total money they spend on buying fixed assets is larger than the same sum netted of asset disposals. The main reason why this Eurostat indicator is published is that it shows something about the longer-term expectations of enterprises. If business confidence is low, enterprises are less likely to tie up new earnings in additional fixed assets, which are usually held for a number of years. If, on the other hand, business confidence is buoyant, {{it is more likely that}} enterprises will spend more of their current earnings on longer-term investments in fixed assets. In turn, the rate at which enterprises invest earnings in longer-term assets is an indicator of business expansion - if the rate declines, then this typically lowers the rate of cumulative business expansion. For example, in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the ratio dropped to slightly below 20% in Q1 2010 from a high of 23% in Q2 2008. Although this 3% drop in the ratio may not seem so large, in reality it signifies a very large amount of money that was no longer spent. The reason is that the total gross investment and gross value-added for the European Union amount to trillions of euro's, while the total gross value-added also fell significantly in 2008-2010.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present differences in Poland’s bilateral trade balances in <b>gross</b> <b>terms</b> and in value added terms in 1995 - 2011, as well as an explanation of such differences. Research Design & Methods: It was decided to explain why Poland’s bilateral trade balances in <b>gross</b> <b>terms</b> and value added terms differ. The calculations were made using the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), based on the input-output approach. Findings: In the years 1995 - 2011, Poland’s trade with the majority of the countries was characterised by widening gaps between balances in <b>gross</b> <b>terms</b> and those in VA terms. The decomposition of bilateral trade balances by VA content demonstrated that the differences in the value of trade balances in <b>gross</b> <b>terms</b> and in VA terms had been mostly determined by two components: ‘multilateral VA net exports to third countries via partner’ and ‘foreign VA in net exports from other countries than partner’. Implications & Recommendations: To appraise benefits from Poland’s bilateral trade better it is recommended to use the decomposition of trade balances by value added content. Contribution & Value Added: The originality of this work lies in the decomposition of Poland’s bilateral trade balances by value added content. Such a decomposition allows to identify factors driving Poland’s bilateral net exports...|$|E
