5|$|Classes were {{initially}} held in July 1754 and were {{presided over by}} the college's first president, Dr. Samuel Johnson. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson</b> was the only instructor of the college's first class, which consisted of a mere eight students. Instruction was held in a new schoolhouse adjoining Trinity Church, located on what is now lower Broadway in Manhattan. The college was officially founded on October 31, 1754, as King's College by royal charter of King George II, making it the oldest institution of higher learning {{in the state of}} New York and the fifth oldest in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1763, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson</b> was {{succeeded in}} the {{presidency}} by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the charged political climate of the American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the college was an undergraduate {{of the class of}} 1777, Alexander Hamilton. The American Revolutionary War broke out in 1776, and was catastrophic for the operation of King's College, which suspended instruction for eight years beginning in 1776 {{with the arrival of the}} Continental Army. The suspension continued through the military occupation of New York City by British troops until their departure in 1783. The college's library was looted and its sole building requisitioned for use as a military hospital first by American and then British forces. Loyalists were forced to abandon their King's College in New York, which was seized by the rebels and renamed Columbia College. The Loyalists, led by Bishop Charles Inglis fled to Windsor, Nova Scotia, where they founded King's Collegiate School.|$|E

50|$|The Rev. Donald MacNicol (Domhnall MacNeacaill; 1735 - 1802), was a Scottish clergyman, as Minister of Lismore in Argyll, and an author. He {{was the son}} of Nicol Macnicol of Succoth, Argyll, and {{the nephew}} of Alexander Stewart of Invernahyle. He is perhaps best known for his Remarks On <b>Dr.</b> Samuel <b>Johnsons</b> Journey To The Hebrides, a work which commented rather vituperatively on <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnsons</b> equally {{insulting}} A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland.|$|R

25|$|Huxley {{was also}} {{an active member of}} the Metaphysical Society, which ran from 1869 to 1880. It was formed around a nucleus of clergy and {{expanded}} to include all kinds of opinions.

25|$|When <b>Dr</b> <b>Johnson</b> and I were by {{ourselves}} at night, I observed of our host, aspectum generosum habet. Et generosum animum, he added.

25|$|In 1775 Frances Burney {{turned down}} a {{marriage}} proposal from one Thomas Barlow, a man whom she had met only once. Her side of the Barlow courtship is amusingly told in her journal. During the period 1782–85 she enjoyed the rewards of her successes as a novelist; she was received at fashionable literary gatherings throughout London. In 1781 Samuel Crisp died. In 1784 <b>Dr</b> <b>Johnson</b> died, and that year also saw the failure of her romance with a clergyman, George Owen Cambridge. She was 33 years old.|$|E

25|$|In 1763, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson</b> was {{succeeded in}} the {{presidency}} by Myles Cooper, a graduate of The Queen's College, Oxford, and an ardent Tory. In the political controversies which preceded The American Revolution, his chief opponent in discussions at the College was an undergraduate {{of the class of}} 1777, Alexander Hamilton. On one occasion, a mob came to the College, bent on doing violence to the president, but Hamilton held their attention with a speech, giving Cooper enough time to escape. The next year the Revolutionary War broke out and the College was turned into a military hospital and barracks.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of Johnson's presidency, the College's campus began to expand, and in 1792 a new library {{extension}} was built to accommodate the College's growing library {{with the help of}} a grant from the Legislature of New York State. In December 1793, the Professorship of Law was filled by the election of James Kent, who gave the first instruction of law at any American University and was a forerunner to the University's Law School. On July 16, 1800, the seventy-four-year-old <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson</b> resigned his presidency of the College. In 1801, the Board of Trustees appointed Charles Henry Wharton as Dr. Johnson's successor. Wharton was to assume the office of president at the August commencement ceremonies, but he did not appear for them, and resigned in the fall.|$|E
25|$|After a short {{residence}} in London, Lucas proceeded {{to the continent}} {{for the purpose of}} studying medicine. At Paris he studied under Petit, and after visiting Rheims proceeded to Leyden, where he graduated M.D. on 20 December 1752. The title of his thesis was De Gangrena et Sphacelo, written in Latin. Не then visited Spa, Aachen, and other baths for the purpose of investigating the composition of their mineral waters. He returned to England in 1753, proceeding to Bath, and after a series of elaborate experiments conducted in public he went to London, where he established himself in practice. In 1756 he published An Essay on Waters. In three Parts: (i) of Simple Waters, (ii) of Cold Medicated Waters, (iii) of Natural Baths. This treatise, reviewed by <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> gave great offence to the faculty at Bath, and having occasion to visit that place in 1757 he became involved in an acrimonious controversy with the heads of the profession there owing to their refusal to consult with him. But the book obtained for him considerable reputation, and enabled him, it is improbably said, to make an annual income of £3,000 by his profession. On 25 June 1759 he was admitted a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London, and he established a successful practice in London.|$|E

500|$|Samuel Johnson (18 September 1709 – 13 December 1784), often {{referred}} to as <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> was an English writer who made lasting contributions to English literature as a poet, essayist, moralist, literary critic, biographer, editor and lexicographer. Johnson was a devout Anglican and committed Tory, and is described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as [...] "arguably the most distinguished man of letters in English history". He is also the subject of the biography, The Life of Samuel Johnson by James Boswell.|$|E
500|$|Rather than an English critic, {{it was the}} German August Wilhelm Schlegel, whose {{lectures on}} the drama had {{recently}} been translated into English, whom Hazlitt {{believed to be the}} greatest critic of Shakespeare's plays. Hazlitt here includes long extracts from Schlegel on Shakespeare, differing with him principally with respect to what he called a [...] "mysticism" [...] that appears in Schlegel's interpretations. He shared with Schlegel an enthusiasm for Shakespeare that he found lacking in <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson.</b> [...] "An overstrained enthusiasm", he remarks, [...] "is more pardonable with respect to Shakespear than the want of it; for our admiration cannot easily surpass his genius." ...|$|E
500|$|The Monthly Review, the Critical Review, the English Review, and the European Magazine {{contained}} reviews that, in {{the words}} of Bertram Davis, characterised the biography as [...] "a malevolent and spiteful account of Johnson's life, grossly inaccurate, and rendered utterly ridiculous by its pompous legalisms and its digressions on every conceivable subject. The book, if they were to be believed, was less a biography than a polemic, less a work of art than a collection of senile gossip." [...] In particular, the Critical Review said, [...] "we often lose <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson...</b> The knight sinks under the weight of his subject, and is glad to escape to scenes more congenial to his disposition, and more suitable to his talents, the garrulity of a literary old man." ...|$|E

500|$|Differing with <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> {{who found}} nothing of genius in Henry VIII but the {{depiction}} of the meek sorrows and virtuous distress of Queen Katherine, Hazlitt finds in this play, though not one of Shakespeare's greatest, [...] "considerable interest of a more mild and thoughtful cast, {{and some of the}} most striking passages in the author's works." [...] In addition to the portrayal of Katherine, Hazlitt likes that of Cardinal Wolsey and of King Henry himself, which, though [...] "drawn with great truth and spirit [...] like a very disagreeable portrait, sketched by the hand of a master." [...] And [...] "the scene of [...] Buckingham led to execution {{is one of the most}} affecting and natural in Shakespear, and one to which there is hardly an approach in any other author." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{classical}} view, {{through at least}} <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson,</b> poetry [...] "holds a mirror up to nature". The Romantics began to shift the focus {{to the role of}} the imagination. In common with his Romantic contemporaries, Hazlitt focuses on how, to communicate the meaning of the play, Shakespeare's imagination, by the medium of poetry, stimulates the reader's or audience's imagination. Several times, Hazlitt observes how Shakespeare by this imaginative construction seemed to become each character in turn. For example, in [...] "Antony and Cleopatra" [...] he stops to observe, [...] "The characters breathe, move, and live. Shakespear [...] becomes them, and speaks and acts for them." [...] And in [...] "Henry IV": [...] "He appears to have been all the characters, and in all the situations he describes." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding Shakespeare's weaving {{together}} of the story's threads, Hazlitt marvels at the [...] "ease and conscious unconcern" [...] with which [...] "he most straggling and seemingly casual incidents are contrived [...] {{in such a}} manner as to lead at last to the most complete developement of the catastrophe." [...] Again, he broadens the discussion and argues against the view of <b>Dr.</b> <b>Johnson</b> [...] "that Shakespear was generally inattentive to the winding-up of his plots. We think the contrary is true; and we might cite in proof of this remark not only the present play, but the conclusion of Lear, of Romeo and Juliet, of Macbeth, of Othello, even of Hamlet, and of other plays of less moment, in which the last act is crowded with decisive events brought about by natural means." ...|$|E
