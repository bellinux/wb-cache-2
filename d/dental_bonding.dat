50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} because this resin can cause severe {{allergic contact dermatitis}} in {{a significant percentage of}} individuals who come into contact with the resin.

Use of PTBP-FR in manufacturing is ubiquitous across numerous industries and commercial products, but most commonly its usage in the manufacture of shoes is implicated in the majority of cases involving contact dermatitis.|$|E
5000|$|Persons with visible white {{fillings}} or crowns. Tooth whitening {{does not}} usually change {{the color of}} fillings and other restorative materials. It does not affect porcelain, other ceramics, or dental gold. However, it can slightly affect restorations made with composite materials, cements and dental amalgams. Tooth whitening will not restore color of fillings, porcelain, and other ceramics when they become stained by foods, drinks, and smoking, as these products are only effective on natural tooth structure. As such, a shade mismatch may be created as the natural tooth surfaces increase in whiteness and the restorations stay the same shade. Whitener does not work where bonding has been used and neither is it effective on tooth-color filling. Other options {{to deal with such}} cases are the porcelain veneers or <b>dental</b> <b>bonding.</b>|$|E
30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the aging {{evaluation}} of <b>dental</b> <b>bonded</b> interfaces is commonly performed by storing specimens in water for different periods of time (as performed in {{the first phase of the}} study) [34], the shelf-life simulation of adhesive vials may be also used in an attempt to obtain important information about the degradability of dental adhesives in regards to their bonding ability. Manufacturers usually perform shelf-life simulation as a standard process during the development of new products. Nevertheless, combining both methods (shelf-life simulation and storage of specimens) may be important for predicting the degradation susceptibility of adhesive blends before polymerization, as well as after their application to the tooth substrate.|$|R

50|$|Bonding {{agents are}} often methacrylates with some {{volatile}} carrier and solvent like acetone. They may also contain diluent monomers. For proper bonding of resin composite restorations, dentin should be conditioned with polyacrylic acids {{to remove the}} smear layer, created during mechanical treatment with dental bore, and expose some of the collagen network or organic matrix of dentin. Adhesive resin should create the so-called hybrid layer (consisting of a collagen network exposed by etching and embedded in adhesive resin). This layer is an interface between dentin and adhesive resin and the final quality of dental restoration depends greatly on its properties. Modern <b>dental</b> <b>bonding</b> systems come as a “three-step system”, where the etchant, primer, and adhesive are applied sequentially; as a “two-step system”, where the etchant and the primer are combined for simultaneous application; and as a “one-step system”, where all the components should be premixed and applied in a single application (so-called seventh generation of bonding agents).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{presented}} a well-characterized biocompatibility profile of <b>dental</b> <b>bonding</b> agents in a mouse macrophage in vitro model. The cellular response to four different formulations of <b>dental</b> <b>bonding</b> resins and the cell viability was determined. Materials were prepared by photopolymeriza-tion and the unreacted monomers were extracted in a buffered medium. Murine macrophages were incubated in the extract medium for 24 h. Cellular viability {{was assessed by}} fluorescence microscopy and Wst- 1 assay, while flow cytometry was used to quantify the apoptotic response. As an indicator of inflammatory responses, real-time polymerase chain reaction was utilized to quantify elevated cytokine production. These responses were monitored by quantifying the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) produced by the cells. Murine macrophage cells exposed to the unfilled resin systems containing glycidyl ether of bisphenol A (Bis-GMA) and 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) had the most adverse response and cells exposed to the filled Bis-GMA and HEMA resin system were the most viable at photopolymerization times. Other resin systems displayed intermediate levels of viability {{when compared with the}} untreated control. The levels of IL- 1 were significantly elevated in all samples.

30|$|The {{development}} of self-etch adhesive systems in dentistry allowed the bonding protocol to become simpler with faster clinical application [1]-[5]. Self-etch adhesives are commonly comprised of methacrylate monomers (mono- or bi-functional), solvents, and initiators [6]. Water is also present {{since it is}} essential to the ionization of acidic monomers, thus enabling substrate demineralization and subsequent monomer infiltration processes [3],[7]. In theory, self-etch adhesives reduce the presence of non-infiltrated collagen layers when compared to etch-and-rinse adhesives since the former can simultaneously demineralize and infiltrate the substrate [8],[9]. In addition, the ionization of acidic monomers allows calcium ion chelation and collagen fiber hybridization, which are important adhesion mechanisms in <b>dental</b> <b>bonding</b> [3].|$|E

30|$|Dental {{adhesive}} {{systems are}} commonly {{characterized by the}} application of three different substances that fill three distinct clinical steps: etching, priming, and bonding [7]. Etching corresponds to the application of an acid substance to demineralize the surface; priming is {{the preparation of the}} etched surface before application of the adhesive, and it is usually applied to dentin alone. Bonding is the application of the hydrophobic resin bond adhesive over enamel and dentin. Acid-etching might be a separate clinical step (etch-and-rinse technique approach [1]), or it might be produced by acidic functional monomers (self-etch materials) [2]. Despite their differences, both techniques have demonstrated long-lasting <b>dental</b> <b>bonding</b> results [1],[2].|$|E

40|$|Over 200 million dental restorations are {{performed}} {{each year in}} America. A dental restoration require a strong bonding of restoration to tooth structure and relies on the dental adhesive to create this mechanical and chemical <b>bonding.</b> <b>Dental</b> adhesion or <b>bonding</b> {{is the process of}} forming an adhesive joint between the composite and tooth substrate: dentin or enamel. Clinical problems such as microleakage at the restoration tooth interface, influx of fluids, or bacteria growth at the cavity wall can be prevented with adhesives that obtain a more intimate bonding. Longevity of the restoration can be enhanced by the adhesive that creates the tight bonding to reduce problems such as postoperative sensitivity, marginal staining, and recurrent caries. The goal of this research project is to investigate the influence of active scrubbing application as compared to passive non-scrubbing application of the etchant component in 4 th generation etch-and-rinse adhesive systems. Shear bond stresses have been measured and compared between application techniques. Verification of resin infiltration depth with each etchant application has been examined with scanning electron microscopy by mounting the etched and bonded enamel surface of the tooth in epoxy and slicing the tooth longitudinally producing a transverse, depth-wise view. Results from this study have clarified the role of resin tag formation as well as tooth morphology during an active acid etchant application for dental restoration...|$|R

30|$|Adhesion {{to tooth}} {{substrates}} should be {{stable over time}} since {{the success of the}} restorative procedure depends on this outcome. However, polymerization stresses originating from the volumetric shrinkage of resin composites and hydrolysis of the hybrid layer/adhesive material are considered the most frequent reasons for bonding failure [1],[10]-[12]. Indeed, the latter reason is an important factor responsible for failure of restorations [5],[13]. Even though the presence of acidic monomers is essential for <b>dental</b> <b>bonding</b> purposes, the acidic nature of self-etch primers/adhesives is also responsible for increasing hydrolysis phenomena [14]. Moreover, hydrophilic monomers commonly present in self-etch formulations such as the 2 -hydroxyl methacrylate (HEMA) and the 10 -methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP) may experience hydrolysis prior to their clinical application when still inside the adhesive vial. This may easily occur if environmental conditions such as humidity and temperature are inadequately controlled, leading to phase separation of the adhesive formulation or volatilization of solvents. Consequently, these chemical alterations may lead to a potential loss of bonding ability of the adhesive [15].|$|E

30|$|Universal {{adhesives}} {{have the}} versatility of being applied to dental tissues either using etch-and-rinse/ER or self-etch/SE bonding approaches. Although SE adhesives {{are easier to}} apply and commonly less technique-sensitive than ER versions [2], {{it has been shown}} that both techniques may lead to appropriates <b>dental</b> <b>bonding</b> [1],[2]. Results of the present study corroborate with those previous findings, since groups SBU-SE and SBU-ER had similar enamel and dentin bond strengths. Taking into consideration that the acid-etching with 37 % phosphoric acid was the only difference between the groups, it can be suggested that the application of the acid as a separate clinical step is not essential to improve the bond strength results when using the universal adhesive tested herein. This may be due to the unique composition of SBU (Table  1): first, it is constituted of 10 -MDP, which is a phosphate monomer that renders the adhesive an acidic character (in Table  1, SBU and CLSE, which are both 10 -MDP-based adhesives, showed the lowest pH values), enabling simultaneous demineralization and monomer infiltration [2]; second, 10 -MDP is a recognized monomer able to chemically interact with tooth minerals [2], improving the long-term stability of the adhesion formed; lastly, SBU is also comprised of a polyalkenoic acid copolymer (Vitrebond™ copolymer), which, according to the manufacturer, provides satisfactory bonding to dentin under moist or dry conditions [11].|$|E

The aim of this in vitro experimental study was to evaluate the effect of vital tooth bleaching on microleakage of existent class V composite resin restorations bonded with three <b>dental</b> <b>bonding</b> agents. Methods : Class V cavities were prepared on buccal surfaces of 72 intact, extracted human anterior teeth with gingival margins in dentin and occlusal margins in enamel, and randomly divided into 3 groups. Cavities in the three groups were treated with Scotch bond Multi-Purpose, a total etch system and Prompt L-Pop and iBond, two self-etch adhesives. All teeth were restored with Z 250 resin composite material and thermo-cycled. Each group was equally divided into the control and the bleached subgroups (n = 12). The bleached subgroups were bleached with 15 % carbamide peroxide gel for 8 {{hours a day for}} 15 days. Microleakage scores were evaluated on the incisal and cervical walls. Data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney and Bonferroni post-hoc tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Bleaching with carbamide peroxide gel significantly increased the microleakage of composite restorations in Prompt L-Pop group at dentinal walls (P = 0. 001).

[1 - 4] As antioxidants were found to protect cells from cytotoxicity of resin monomers in previous studies,[5 - 8] we investigated the effects of common antioxidants, such as!-carotene, res-veratrol and Vitamin E on anti-differentiation activity of bonding agents without compromising bond strength. Methacrylate monomers used in dentistry {{have been shown to}} induce DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), a severe type of DNA damage. The formation of classical products of oxidative DNA damage, were studied using the UV-detection method. We found that exposure of 2 ’-deoxyguanosine, phenylalanine and 2 ’-deoxythymene to a commercially available dental composite restorative material (Esthet-X micromatrix restorative composite material) lead to various degrees of formation of 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 ’-deoxyguanosine (8 oxodG), tyrosine and 5 -hydroxy- 2 ’-deoxythymidine (5 OHdT) as essential markers of oxidative DNA double stranded damage. The yields of 8 oxodG, tyrosine and 5 OHdT appear to be negligible in the presence of antioxidant containing chitosan hydrogels.
