25|$|The ballet {{became famous}} for Nijinsky's leap {{through one of}} the two large windows {{at the back of the}} stage. The height of the leap was an {{illusion}} though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through the window on the sixth step. The skirting board (base board) under the window was very low, giving the illusion that the leap was higher than it actually was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. No one in the audience saw Nijinsky land. <b>It</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> would soar on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the orchestra pit who held the penultimate chord. In doing so, the leap was given a sense of great length and height.|$|E
25|$|The Ashes series {{had been}} a {{disappointment}} and Cowdrey decided to miss the tough tour of India and Pakistan, which was led by Ted Dexter. He lost to India 2–0, but beat Pakistan 1–0 and made 712 Test runs (71.20) on the tour, including his highest Test score of 205. May returned to play for Surrey, but refused to play for England and retired from cricket after a few games in 1963. When Pakistan toured England in 1962 Dexter was made captain for the First Test, winning by an innings and 24 runs (Cowdrey making 159) and the Second Test, which was won by 9 wickets. Cowdrey replaced him in the Third Test as the selectors considered their options for the forthcoming tour of Australia and he won by an innings and 117 runs. When Cowdrey was made captain in the final Gentleman v Players match at Lord's <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> would be chosen, but {{he was forced to}} withdraw because of kidney stones and Dexter was put in charge. However, he found a new rival in the old Sussex captain the Reverend David Sheppard, who was willing to take a sabbatical from his church mission in the East End in order to tour Australia. Sheppard made 112 for the Gentlemen and was chosen for the tour, but Dexter was confirmed as captain for the last two Tests against Pakistan and the forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand with Cowdrey as vice-captain. Cowdrey recovered to open the batting in the Fifth Test and make his highest Test score of 182, adding 238 with Dexter (172) and ending the series with 409 runs (81.80).|$|E

500|$|On the Broadway beat, Broderick swiftly {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for violence. His fists were once described as [...] "huge lethal pistons that could beat a man senseless in half a heartbeat," [...] and to [...] "broderick" [...] became Broadway slang for being knocked out by a single punch. His knuckles were broken many times. Once he knocked out the gangster Francis [...] "Two Gun" [...] Crowley with a single punch, even though Crowley was pointing a gun at him. He {{was said to have}} demanded that hoodlums tip their hat to him, and once was said to have gone to the funeral of a member of the Hudson Dusters gang and spat in his eye. Broderick would wrap a lead pipe in a newspaper, which allowed him to beat gangsters while <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was giving them a friendly swat with a rolled-up newspaper.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{put effort}} into trying to make Edgeworth look right; Eshiro described Edgeworth's running animation as [...] "graceful, while exerting effort", while Iwamoto was not entirely convinced and thought <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> is [...] "walking really fast accidentally". Eshiro and Yamazaki wanted to add a lot of features to the Little Thief system, but due to time constraints it ended up more simplistic than they had originally envisioned. Eshiro used his experience with producing action games such as Shadow of Rome and laying out scenes to get backgrounds to move smoothly without scrolling issues when Edgeworth moves. The programmers faced big technical challenges and had to make significant modifications to the game when implementing the graphics: in the game, two animated characters - whose graphics each are larger than those in previous Ace Attorney games - appear simultaneously {{and on top of}} smaller [...] "mini-avatar" [...] graphics. Eshiro said that he thinks they pushed the graphic processing ability of the Nintendo DS system to its limits for this. Eshiro said that they would consider making DSiWare episodes if demand was high enough, but {{that they did not have}} any plans at the time. He said that there were many technical aspects to consider, such as memory limitations for DSiWare.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} a PG-13 rating. To avoid an R rating, {{a scene that}} implied sex was cut. Browning said, [...] "Ihad a very tame and mild love scene with Jon Hamm ... I think it's great for this young girl to actually take control of her own sexuality." [...] She added, [...] " [...] got Zack to edit the scene and make it look less like she's into it. Zack said he edited {{it down to the}} point where <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> was taking advantage of her.

With Tony Pérez and Pete Rose already gone, the [...] "Big Red Machine" [...] was {{beginning}} to come apart, and the Reds slumped to a third-place finish in [...] Foster led the club with 25 home runs and 93 RBIs. A rejuvenated Cincinnati Reds team won a major league best 66 games in the strike shortened [...] season, but managed to miss the playoffs {{as a result of}} the split-season format used that season. Foster returned to form, finishing second to Mike Schmidt in the NL's RBI race. At this point in his career, when <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> would one day rank among the game's all-time greats, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.|$|E
2500|$|While Thurber {{drew his}} {{cartoons}} {{in the usual}} fashion in the 1920s and 1930s, his failing eyesight later required changes. He drew them on very large sheets of paper using a thick black crayon (or on black paper using white chalk, from which they were photographed and the colors reversed for publication). Regardless of method, his cartoons became as noted as his writings; they possessed an eerie, wobbly feel that seems to mirror his idiosyncratic view on life. He once wrote that people said <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> drew them under water. Dorothy Parker, a contemporary and friend of Thurber, referred to his cartoons as having the [...] "semblance of unbaked cookies". The last drawing Thurber completed was a self-portrait in yellow crayon on black paper, which was featured as the cover of Time magazine on July 9, 1951. The same drawing {{was used for the}} dust jacket of The Thurber Album (1952).|$|E
2500|$|It was {{initially}} stated by police that Menezes was shot {{five times in}} the head. Mark Whitby, a passenger on the train Menezes had run onto, said: 'one of [...] was carrying a black handgun—it looked like an automatic—He half tripped… they pushed him to the floor, bundled {{on top of him}} and unloaded five shots into him.' Another passenger, Dan Copeland, said: 'an officer jumped on the door to my left and screamed, [...] "Everybody out!" [...] People just froze in their seats cowering for a few seconds and then leapt up. As I turned out the door on to the platform, I heard four dull bangs.' Menezes's cousin Alex Pereira, who lived with him, asserted that Menezes had been shot from behind: 'I pushed my way into the morgue. [...] They wouldn't let me see him. His mouth was twisted by the wounds and <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had been shot {{from the back of the}} neck.' Later reports confirmed that Jean Charles de Menezes was shot a total of eight times: seven times in the head and once in the shoulder.|$|E

2500|$|The Browns' {{success was}} {{replicated}} in , with 22 {{touchdown passes and}} 3,000 yards for Kosar and eight Pro Bowlers (Kosar, Mack, Dixon, Golic, Minnifield, linebacker Clay Matthews, wide receiver Gerald McNeil, and offensive lineman Cody Risien). Cleveland won another AFC Central crown with a 10–5 record and easily defeated the Indianapolis Colts 38–21 in the divisional playoff {{to set up a}} rematch with the Broncos in the AFC championship game, this time in Denver. With the score 21–3 in favor of the Broncos at halftime, Kosar led a third-quarter comeback with two touchdowns by Earnest Byner and another by Reggie Langhorne. Early in the fourth quarter, Webster Slaughter's four-yard touchdown catch tied the game at 31–31. The Broncos regained the lead with a 20-yard Sammy Winder touchdown with less than five minutes to go, setting the stage for one final drive by the Browns. Kosar drove the Browns to the Broncos' 8-yard line with 1:12 to go, and handed off to Byner. Just when <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>like</b> <b>he</b> had an open route to the end zone, Broncos defensive back Jeremiah Castille stripped him of the ball. The Broncos recovered what became known as [...] "The Fumble". After taking an intentional safety, the Broncos had shocked the Browns again, 38–33.|$|E
2500|$|British {{newspapers}} The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph both {{reported that}} [...] "The End" [...] had received negative reviews and disappointed its viewers. Alan Sepinwall of Star-Ledger was less enthusiastic of the finale, stating [...] "I'm still wrestling with my feelings about 'The End'... I thought {{most of it}} worked like gangbusters. ... But as someone who did spend {{at least part of}} the last six years dwelling on the questions that were unanswered—be they little things like the outrigger shootout or why The Others left Dharma in charge of the Swan station after the purge, or bigger ones like Walt—I can't say I found 'The End' wholly satisfying, either as closure for this season or the series. ... There are narrative dead ends in every season of 'Lost,' but it felt like season six had more than usual." [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times gave [...] "The End" [...] a mixed review, as the episode showed that the series was [...] "shaky on the big picture—on organizing the welter of mythic-religious-philosophical material it insisted on incorporating into its plot—but highly skilled at the small one, the moment to moment business of telling an exciting story. Rendered insignificant ... were the particulars of what they had done on the island." [...] David Zurawik of the Baltimore Sun gave the episode a highly negative review, writing [...] "If this is supposed to be such a smart and wise show, unlike anything else on network TV (blah, blah, blah), why such a wimpy, phony, quasi-religious, white-light, huggy-bear ending. ...
