25|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} a 150-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8, {{which was the}} standard engine for all Centurys. In addition to the 175-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 (with single exhaust), the 190-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 (with <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust)</b> was available only on the Gran Sport. Two 455 cubic-inch V8s were available including the 250-horsepower four-barrel and the Stage 1 four-barrel rated at 270 horsepower (both with <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust)</b> - all net figures and similar to the 1972 models. More than 700 '73 Century GS models were built with the Stage 1 455, the majority with the three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission and a small number with the four-speed manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1987, Oldsmobile {{attempted}} to bolster sagging Toronado sales by introducing a sportier model called the Troféo, which boasted standard leather bucket seats, faux <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust,</b> more-aggressive styling, and a stiffer suspension (the highly regarded corporate FE3 package, with retuned shocks, struts and other components).|$|E
2500|$|The {{price was}} reduced {{and the power}} was {{increased}} by way of AMC's new [...] V8 that was rated at [...] with a four-barrel carburetor and <b>dual</b> <b>exhausts.</b> Consumers reacted by buying only 4,108 units.|$|R
2500|$|All Rambler Rebels {{benefitted from}} bigger brakes, {{improved}} automatic transmission controls, and numerically lower axle ratios for improved fuel economy.

5000|$|Many {{cars were}} [...] "hopped up" [...] with engine {{modifications}} such as adding additional carburetors, high compression heads, and <b>dual</b> <b>exhausts.</b> Engine swaps were often done, {{the object of}} which was to put the most powerful engine in the lightest possible frame and body combination.|$|R
25|$|Factory {{cast iron}} {{manifolds}} exited to a true <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust</b> with Thrush (a Tenneco brand) two-chamber oval mufflers with Woodpecker logos. These were standard baffled mufflers, not glass packs. Minimal baffeling gave a deep throaty sound, similar to modern Flowmasters. The exhaust exited through chrome tips attached with hose clamps.|$|E
25|$|The Mustang GT {{features}} a stiffer, better handling {{version of the}} standard suspension, larger 12.4-inch front brake discs (versus the 11.4-inch discs used on V6 Mustangs), standard four-channel ABS with traction control, a two-piece drive shaft, a stainless steel <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust,</b> standard grille-mounted fog lights, and 17-inch wheels with optional 18-inch wheels.|$|E

50|$|Compared to the Retro models (and {{the others}} that would follow) the VTX1800 type C was {{identifiable}} by its two-into-one exhaust system, and its speedometer mounted within the handlebar risers. All the other models had staggered <b>dual</b> <b>exhausts</b> and a tank-mounted speedometer, {{as well as a}} larger radiator.|$|R
50|$|The {{package was}} dubbed 4-4-2 {{based on its}} {{combination}} of four-barrel carburetor, four-speed manual transmission, and <b>dual</b> <b>exhausts.</b> Priced at $285.14, it was available on any F-85 or Cutlass model except the station wagon, although most were Cutlass hardtop coupés (Oldsmobile archives indicate that approximately 10 four-door sedans were built with the B09 option).|$|R
25|$|The Taurus {{received}} another redesign for 2000, which replaced {{many of the}} oval-derived design {{elements of}} the previous model with sharper creases and corners, an aspect of Ford's New Edge styling language. To reduce the car's price and keep it competitive, Ford reduced costs on the car in 1999, such as giving the Taurus sedan rear drum brakes on ABS equipped vehicles (previously, upgrading to ABS included the addition of rear disc brakes), eliminating the <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust</b> on the higher end models, and trimming many other small features.|$|E
25|$|Technical {{changes for}} 1975 {{included}} {{the addition of}} a catalytic converter and electronic ignition to not only meet the stringent 1975 and later emission requirements, but also extended routine maintenance intervals, and improved fuel economy and driveability which was a must in the era immediately following the 1973–74 energy crisis, but also spelled the end of <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust</b> systems and mandated the use of unleaded gasoline as the converter could be rendered useless if contaminated with lead. Axle ratios were also numerically lowered to aid in improving gas mileage. The 455 four-barrel V8, now rated at , was retained as the standard and only available engine.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{inspired}} by a dominating 1–2 finish for Falcon hardtops at the 1977 Hardie Ferodo 1000, Ford introduced the limited-edition Cobra, which used the last 400 hardtop coupé bodyshells. Based on the Falcon GS Hardtop model, each Cobra was individually numbered and featured highlights such as Globe 15-in alloy road wheels copied from Ferrari intended to aid brake disc cooling, ER70 H15 radial-ply tyres, comprehensive instrumentation, bonnet scoops, driving lights, <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust,</b> four-wheel disc brakes, and a distinctive white and blue colour scheme. The 5.8-l engines were installed in cars numbered 002 to 199 and No 351, and the 4.9-litre engines were installed in the rest (001, plus 200 to 400 except for no. 351).|$|E

25|$|The Caprice PPV {{concept car}} {{was based on}} the Middle Eastern spec Caprice LS, which {{was based on the}} Holden WM Caprice Series I. The front end and grille are the same as the 2007-2010 Caprice LS. The Caprice letter is {{engraved}} into the chrome trim on the trunk, there is PPV lettering {{on the right side of}} the rear fascia and a FlexFuel nameplate, which was on GM vehicles in North America from 2007 through 2009. The PPV has <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust,</b> a floor shifter in the console, a prisoner partition with rifle and shotgun mounts, lights and siren controls in the console, 18 inch steel rims & center caps from the Impala 9C1, and a touch screen in place of the radio and HVAC controls. A prototype similar to the concept car in LAPD was shown around Australia by Holden.

25|$|In 2004 the re-introduction of the Pontiac GTO (based on the Holden Monaro from Australia) took place, {{effectively}} {{replacing the}} spot {{left by the}} Firebird and Camaro. The GTO was also initially powered by the 350 HP LS-1 V8 in 2004. It had an independent front and rear suspension and an upscale full leather interior. Its clean lines and understated looks drew some criticism. Sales did not reach the 18,000 units that GM predicted. Initial dealer mark ups, slow shipping transit from Australia, and lack of advertisement by GM were to blame. Due to the retirement of the LS1 engine in 2004, Pontiac added the drive-by-wire 400 HP LS2 V8 for 2005–2006 model years at no additional cost. Additional upgrades also consisted of stainless steel <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust</b> outlets, larger Corvette sourced PBR brakes with EBD, larger front vented rotors with vented rear rotors, and functional heat extractor hood scoops. The Bonneville introduced the GXP trim level to replace the SSEi. The Bonneville GXP featured a 4.6 Northstar V8, borrowed from Cadillac, and replaced the Supercharged 3800 Series II. The redesigned Grand Prix made its appearance, and featured a GT and GTP trim level. The GTP's new 3.8L supercharged V6 now made , up 20 from the previous generation. TAPshift was also introduced {{as well as a}} Competition Group package (Comp G).|$|E
500|$|For the 2008 Australian International Motor Show in Sydney, Holden {{announced}} the MY09.5 upgrade involving the standardisation of the [...] "premium" [...] Alloytec V6 across the Commodore range from 1 November 2008, whereas previously {{it had been}} reserved for the SV6 and Calais. Omega and Berlina variants acquired variable valve timing, like the High Output engine, but not the [...] "premium" [...] <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust</b> system and the five-speed automatic transmission. These changes result in the base petrol V6 producing [...] less power and [...] less torque than the engine it replaces. However, Omega and Berlina sedans benefit from a twopercent fuel efficiency improvement, or fourpercent for wagons. Additionally, emissions have also been reduced allowing petrol-powered variants to achieve Euro VI certification, a pending emission standard for European introduction in 2014. These changes extend further than the petrol engine as bi-fuel LPG variants benefit from an eightpercent improvement in fuel economy when run on LPG. This reduced fuel consumption does however, come at a cost—LPG-equipped models are rated at , [...] less than before.|$|E

500|$|Toyota {{claims that}} the Aurion is {{designed}} to Australian tastes, {{although it has been}} designed with markets such as Asia in mind. Hogios states that the Aurion follows the traits of current Australian styling, with a tendency to look towards European designs for inspiration. In addition, like its other vehicles of similar vintage, Toyota designed the Aurion within the realm of its [...] "vibrant clarity" [...] design language. According to chief designer Hogios, the car makes particular use of the [...] "vibrant clarity" [...] theory known as [...] "perfect imbalance". This involves body features that act as a counterpoint to other body features. Examples of this include intersecting concave and convex surfaces and vertical sculpted features on the front fascia, which are balanced by the horizontal headlamps. The front-end's [...] "double concave architecture" [...] can also be characterised by its protruding bonnet crease line and deep grille. The same architecture is applied at the rear, with a deep bumper, a clamshell-shaped boot lid that envelops over the flanks, <b>dual</b> <b>exhaust</b> pipes and tail lamps. Design patents were filed on 27 December 2005 at the United States Patent and Trademark Office.|$|E
