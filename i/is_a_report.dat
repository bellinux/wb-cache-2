5|$|KC-33A – A {{proposed}} 747 {{was also}} adapted as an aerial refueling tanker and was bid against the DC-10-30 during the 1970s Advanced Cargo Transport Aircraft (ACTA) program {{that produced the}} KC-10A Extender. Before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, Iran bought four 747-100 aircraft with air-refueling boom conversions to support its fleet of F-4 Phantoms. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> of using a KC-33A in H-3 airstrike during Iran–Iraq War. It is unknown whether these aircraft remain usable as tankers. Since then, other proposals have emerged for conversion of later 747-400 aircraft for this role.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, though there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow {{in a range of}} soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
5|$|Telopea oreades is {{not listed}} under Commonwealth {{environmental}} legislation {{and is not}} considered by respective state authorities to be rare or threatened in Victoria or New South Wales. The species does occur in the threatened Cool Temperate Rainforest Community in Victoria that is protected under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, {{and it is a}} component of the threatened Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests of far southern New South Wales. Furthermore, planted specimens are frequently stolen from bush regeneration sites as they are desirable garden plants. Conversely in New Zealand, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> of T. oreades escaping into kanuka scrub from the trout hatchery gardens on the Tongariro River south of Lake Taupo.|$|E

In the Indian Ocean, it occurs from South Africa to the Red Sea, including Madagascar, Mauritius, and the Seychelles, and from there eastward {{along the coast of}} the Indian Subcontinent to Southeast Asia, including Sri Lanka, the Andaman Islands, and the Maldives. In the Pacific Ocean, it is found from southern China and the Philippines to Indonesia, northern Australia and New Caledonia, and also inhabits numerous oceanic islands, including the Marshall, Gilbert, Society, and Hawaiian Islands and Tuamotu. Contrary to what most sources state, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> suggesting that the specimens of this species from Japanese waters might be from Taiwan, however a number of sightings and captures of this species have been reported from the inshore waters of Ishigaki Island of Okinawa Prefecture in southern Japan. A Lessepsian migrant, this shark has colonized the eastern Mediterranean Sea by way of the Suez Canal.|$|E

However, the source of this story is Ives himself; since Mahler died, {{there was no way to}} verify whether he had seen the score of the symphony or decided to perform it in the 1911–12 season. Nonetheless, it is known that Ives regularly attended New York Philharmonic concerts and probably heard Mahler conduct the Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
