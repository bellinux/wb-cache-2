50|$|A {{concept paper}} on the Law of <b>Ecocide</b> was sent out to governments In June 2012 {{the idea of making}} <b>ecocide</b> a crime was {{presented}} to legislators and judges from around the world at the World Congress on Justice Governance and Law for Environmental Sustainability, held in Mangaratiba before the Rio +20 Earth Summit, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development.

40|$|This work {{incorporates}} {{the concept of}} biocultural heritage to the discussion on the alternatives for the socio-environmental crises promoted by globalization and transnationalization of the economy. Climate global change represents the largest failure the markets have ever seen, and interacts with other market imperfections. From a southern perspective, environmental politics does not trust globalization {{as an alternative to}} solve global environmental crisis, even under a “green economy” concept. Poverty and <b>ecocides</b> as components of the neoliberal colonialism are the intrinsic logic to the extractivism suffered in Latin America: green fields with millions of hectares of transgenic corn and soya, massive deforested areas for timber plantations, mega hydro electrical projects for mining concessions and fracking for shell gas extraction are just a few examples which have invaded our landscapes. From the multi diverse movements in Latin America, the critical interculturalism, indigenous philosophies, biocultural memory, the ecological importance of traditional knowledge and well living, it seeks approaches that go beyond this abysmal nature-culture duality and the instrumental western idea about body and nature. Since 2000 the concept of biocultural diversity has emerged and the idea of heritage was added to this concept, as an essential component of “defend what is ours” idea. In this work I intend to link the concept of biocultural heritage with the southern epistemology...|$|R

The definition proposed includes provisions for both individual and state responsibility and would be a strict liability crime(including both intent and negligence). It would create a duty of care in events of naturally occurring <b>ecocide</b> as well as creating criminal responsibility for human caused <b>ecocide.</b>|$|E

This initiative aimed at criminalising <b>ecocide,</b> the extensive damage and destruction of ecosystems, including the denial of market access for products based on <b>ecocide</b> to the EU and investments in activities causing <b>ecocide.</b> Three MEPs, Keith Taylor, Eva Joly, and Jo Leinen, publicly gave the first signatures.

5000|$|The term <b>ecocide</b> is more {{recently}} {{used to refer}} to the destructive impact of humanity on its own natural environment. As a group of complex organisms we are committing <b>ecocide</b> through unsustainable exploitation of the planet's resources. The geological era we are living in, known as the anthropocene, is so named because the activities of the human species are influencing the Earth's natural state in a way never seen before. The most notable example is that of the atmosphere which is being transformed through the emission of gases from fossil fuel use : carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons etc. The <b>ecocide</b> we are witnessing is a symptom of the disregard and reward for accounting for the damage being caused. U.S. environmental theorist and activist Patrick Hossay [...] argues that the human species is committing <b>ecocide,</b> via industrial civilization's effects on the global environment. Much of the modern environmental movement stems from this belief as a precept.|$|E

Others, including Indira Gandhi from India and Tang Ke, {{the leader of the}} Chinese delegation, also denounced the war in human and environmental terms. They too called for <b>ecocide</b> to be an international crime. A Working Group on Crimes Against the Environment was formed at the conference, and a draft <b>Ecocide</b> Convention was submitted into the United Nations in 1973.|$|E

He proposed that such breaches, where deliberate, reckless or negligent, be identified as <b>ecocide</b> where they entail serious, and extensive or lasting, ecological damage; international consequences; and waste.|$|E

The Rome Statute currently acknowledges four crimes against peace: genocide; crimes against humanity; war crimes; and the crime of aggression. Each of these crimes affects human victims. While Higgins’ proposed definition of <b>ecocide</b> attends to inhabitants’ “peaceful enjoyment”, the victim the amendment is primarily promising to protect is not human but environmental.|$|E
