Citing a 1965 study by McFarlane, Poocharoen reported that beer contained ~ 12-24 mg/L, wort contained ~11-13 mg/L, and malt contained ~ 67 μg/g of hordenine.The hordenine content of various malts and malt fractions was extensively studied by Poocharoen himself, who also provided a good coverage of related literature up to 1983. This researcher found a mean concentration of hordenine in raw barley of ~ 0.7 μg/g; in green malts (i.e. barley that had been soaked in water for 2 days then germinated for 4 days), the mean concentration was ~ 21 μg/g, and in kilned malts (i.e. green malts that had been heated in a kiln for 1-2 days) the mean concentration was ~ 28 μg/g.

50|$|NMT was {{isolated}} {{as a natural}} product for the first time, from germinating barley roots, by Kirkwood and Marion in 1950. These chemists found that 600 g of barley, after germination and 10-day growth, yielded 168 mg of N-methyltyramine. Since barley, via its conversion to malt, is used extensively {{in the production of}} beer, beer and malt have been examined by several groups of investigators for the presence of NMT. Citing a 1965 study by McFarlane, Poocharoen reported that beer contained ~ 5-8 mg/L of NMT.

40|$|Low {{concentrations}} of (1, 3; 1, 4) -β-ᴅ-glucan are desired in malt/wort created from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to ensure efficiency during brewing. This goal {{can be achieved}} through low grain β-glucan content, high malt β-glucanase activity, or a combination thereof. Evaluation of these traits is time-consuming and expensive since malting must occur before analysis, thus they are ideal for the identification of associated markers to permit marker-assisted selection. Two genetic mapping approaches were taken to evaluate these traits. First, a bi-parental QTL mapping population was developed from the Western Canadian two-row, spring, hulled varieties CDC Meredith and CDC Kindersley. CDC Meredith has normal to higher grain β-glucan content and higher wort β-glucan content, while CDC Kindersley has normal to lower grain β-glucan content and very low wort β-glucan content. Secondly, a 92 member association mapping (AM) population was assembled consisting of two-row, spring, hulled elite malting breeding lines and varieties derived from eight different barley breeding programs focused on Western Canada. Both populations were grown over a two year period and assessed for <b>kilned</b> <b>malt</b> β-glucanase activity, grain, malt, and wort β-glucan content, plus green malt β-glucanase activity in the AM population. Both populations were genotyped using the Barley 9 K iSELECT Genotyping BeadChip and the QTL population was also genotyped with DArTseq markers. As expected, green malt β-glucanase activity typically had a stronger correlation to malt/wort β-glucan content than did either <b>kilned</b> <b>malt</b> β-glucanase activity or grain β-glucan content. Ten unique QTLs (four for grain β-glucan, two for malt β-glucan, and three for <b>kilned</b> <b>malt</b> β-glucanase) were identified in the QTL population and eight marker-trait associations were identified in the AM population for grain β-glucan, green/kilned malt β-glucanase, or a combination thereof. One common genomic region on chromosome 2 H was identified in both studies which was associated with grain β-glucan content. In the QTL and AM populations, six and five QTLs and marker-trait associations identified were novel, respectively, while the others overlay previously identified regions. In some cases, underlying genes were identified which may explain the observed associations. Lines with high β-glucanase activity and heat stability were identified in the AM population, thus through crossing, lines possessing both of these beneficial traits could be generated. Further trials {{to collect data on}} these traits would be desirable to validate the identified markers and confirm the β-glucanase heat stability data...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of microorganisms producing cell wall hydrolysing enzymes such as xylanases during malting can improve mash filtration behaviour and consequently have potential for more efficient wort production and enhanced beer flavour quality and stability. Therefore, arabinoxylan-degrading bacteria occurring on the grains during malting were isolated, screened for xylanase activity, and identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. In this way, xylanolytic bacteria such as Sphingobacterium multivorum, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Aeromonas salmonicida were identified. In addition, as especially microbial xylanases {{belonging to the}} glycosyl hydrolase (GH) family 10 are highly interesting for malting process optimisation, we also assessed the diversity and distribution of these xylanase genes by 454 pyrosequencing during malting, i. e. from barley up to <b>kilned</b> <b>malt.</b> Results provide a deep insight into the occurrence and diversity of xylanase sequences of microbial origin during malting. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Compounds {{possessing}} antioxidant activity play {{a crucial}} role in delaying or preventing lipid oxidation in foods and beverages during processing and storage. Such reactions lead to loss of product quality, especially as a consequence of off-flavor formation. The aim of this study was to determine the antioxidant activity of kilned (standard) and roasted (speciality) malts in relation to phenolic compounds, sugars, amino acids, and color [assessed as European Brewing Convention units (degrees EBC) and absorbance at 420 nm]. The concentrations of sugars and amino acids decreased with the intensity of the applied heat treatment, and this was attributed to the extent of the Maillard reaction, as well as sugar caramelization, in the highly roasted malts. Proline, followed by glutamine, was the most abundant free amino/imino acid in the malt samples, except those that were highly roasted, and maltose was the most abundant sugar in all malts. Levels of total phenolic compounds decreased with heat treatment. Catechin and ferulic acid were the most abundant phenolic compounds in the majority of the malts, and amounts were highest in the kilned samples. In highly roasted malts, degradation products of ferulic acid were identified. Antioxidant activity increased with the intensity of heating, in parallel with color formation, and was significantly higher for roasted <b>malts</b> compared to <b>kilned</b> <b>malts.</b> In <b>kilned</b> <b>malts,</b> phenolic compounds were the main identified contributors to antioxidant activity, with Maillard reaction products also playing a role.

This study evaluated changes in rheological profiles under different operational conditions and compared these changes with reference to malt fermentability from {{a limited number of}} samples. Viscosity measurements of samples were also made using different RVA (models 3 D+and 4) analysis conditions including a brewhouse time-temperature profile, heating/cooling rate, particle size and enzyme activity. Rheological measurements using the RVA- 3 D+gave similar results compared with the RVA- 4, indicating adequate sensitivity of the RVA 3 D+for discriminatory purposes. Use of a time-temperature profile of a commercial brewery mashing process was unsuitable. When malt enzymes were inactivated with silver nitrate, differences in viscosities were observed. However, this eliminated the ability to discriminate on fermentability. Increasing or decreasing the heating rate influenced the time available for enzyme action, which affected the degree of discrimination. This also provided some insight into physical and biochemical processes affected by differences in particle size.

40|$|Malt has {{a complex}} {{microbial}} population, which changes as the malting process commences. Little {{is known about}} the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in each of the malting phases. In this study, we determined the number of LAB present in the different phases of malting with Clipper and Prisma barley cultivars. The strains were identified to species level by using numerical analysis of total soluble cell protein patterns, RAPD-PCR banding patterns and 16 S rRNA sequencing. The number of viable LAB in the barley before steep was higher in Prisma than Clipper (7. 6 × 104 and 1. 2 × 103 cfu/g, respectively). Despite this, the number of viable cells recorded in the first steep water was slightly higher for Clipper (9. 0 × 105 cfu/g) than Prisma (5. 5 × 105 cfu/g). More or less, the same cell numbers were recorded for the two barley cultivars after the first and second dry stands. Both cultivars displayed {{more or less the same}} cell numbers (3. 7 × 107 for Clipper and 3. 2 × 107 cfu/g for Prisma) after the third day of germination. However, a higher number of LAB were detected in the kilned Prisma malt (6. 9 × 104 cfu/g) than the Clipper malt (1. 5 × 104 cfu/g). Leuconostoc argentinum, Le. lactis and Weissella confusa were the most predominant in both cultivars. A few strains were identified as W. paramesenteroides (four strains), Lactobacillus casei (five strains), Lactococcus lactis (five strains) and Lb. rhamnosus (two strains).

40|$|Description of topic - Optimization of {{malt quality}} {{in terms of}} fast {{filtration}} is {{a critical factor in}} the malting and brewing industry. Since malt quality is inversely related to the concentration of endosperm cell wall components, management of cell wall degrading microorganisms may result in enhanced processing. An essential step in microflora management during malting, however, requires the understanding of the microbial community structure as well as the population dynamics in the processing. Although most studies undertaken so far focus on specific microbial populations using culture-dependent techniques, in this study an integrated approach of different technologies for microbial community profiling is presented as a basis for process optimization. Materials and methods - Both culture dependent and culture independent molecular techniques will be used to characterize the microbial (bacterial) communities in different industrial malting settings, generating malt of different quality. 16 S ribosomal DNA-targeted Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, supported by sequencing of clone libraries, will be used to screen and compare the microbial communities in the different maltings at different stages of the malting process, i. e. from barley up to <b>kilned</b> <b>malt.</b> In addition, the microflora present in used irrigation water and the air will be monitored. Specific patterns associated with high-quality malt will be further investigated, aiming at obtaining cultures responsible for the malt quality. Subsequently, promising bacterial strains will be screened for their cell wall degrading capacity using agar plate assays. Finally, one or more bacterial strains will be selected to evaluate their performance in practice using inoculation trials on a representative pilot scale malting facility. In addition, based on an off line closed-circuit perfusion approach, efforts will be made to manage the microbial community {{in such a way that}} desired populations will be stimulated and can be re-inoculated in the process. Novelty - With the increased demand for ‘clean-label’ technology, the malting and brewing industry is seeking for novel approaches to optimize the use of in-house microflora in the malting process. This study may result in the discovery of promising, process-borne microorganisms which may enhance malt processability, or the malting and brewing process in general. Most presumably, this research will reveal previously unidentified species as novel detection technologies will be used to unravel the microbial communities. Altogether, this project might be the basis for further process optimization such as the improvement of the filtration step. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Non-starch polysaccharides, such as beta-glucans and arabinoxylans, {{present in}} the cell walls of barley grains, are {{important}} contributors to wort filtration problems due to their viscous nature. Since nowadays it is the current practice to produce well-modified malts in the malting plant, the role of beta-glucans in reduced filtration rate is of minor importance because of their advanced degradation during malting. Conversely, {{a lot of the}} filtration problems to date are associated with arabinoxylans which are not extensively degraded during malting, as the endogenous enzymes that hydrolyse arabinoxylans, i. e. xylanases, are produced relatively late in the germination process. Furthermore, because of the relatively low temperature stability of endogenous xylanases, arabinoxylans are insufficiently degraded during the brewing process. In addition, it is well-known that a substantial part of the malt xylanolytic activity originates from the microbial community present on the barley kernels, representing a second metabolically active compound in the malting ecosystem. Against this background, this doctoral study aimed to generate insights into the xylanase-producing bacterial community present during barley malting. Special emphasis was put on the bacterial glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 xylanases, since they degrade arabinoxylans very effectively and are resistant to xylanase inhibitors present in barley. As traditional culture-dependent approaches are known to underestimate the microbial species diversity, molecular culture-independent 454 amplicon pyrosequencing was successfully applied to investigate the structure and dynamics of the bacterial communities associated with industrial malting. The bacterial community structure in the malting ecosystem was found to be complex and community dynamics appeared to differ from year to year and to be influenced by the malting process steps. Although many bacteria were found to occur from the harvested barley kernel up {{to the end of the}} malting process, the observed differences between two harvest years could not be explained by a different microbial load initially present on the barley kernels. Environmental parameters such as varying seasonal weather conditions and, as a consequence of this, adjustments of the air circulation pattern in the maltings, could potentially explain the differences in bacterial community structure of germinated barley and <b>kilned</b> <b>malt</b> samples between both investigated years. The bacterial community structure was also found to change along the malting process, but eventually the <b>kilned</b> <b>malt</b> samples were more similar to their corresponding harvested barley sample than to the germinating barley samples. Also at the phylum level, clear differences could be observed between both harvest and malting years. In order to explore the arabinoxylan-degrading microbial community present during barley malting, the genetic diversity and distribution of GH 10 xylanase genes during malting were examined using 454 amplicon pyrosequencing. Most of the GH 10 xylanases detected in the malting barley samples showed a high identity with known xylanases. The GH 10 xylanase sequences obtained in this study were mainly related to xylanases from the phylum Bacteroidetes, in particular from the genus Sphingobacterium. The second part of this study focuses on the availability of xylanolytic bacteria and their exploitation during malting. Therefore, the diversity of the arabinoxylan-degrading bacterial community during barley malting was assessed by microbial isolation, cultivation on different media enriched with arabinoxylan, and identification. As such, 33 species-level operational taxonomic units belonging to 25 genera were found. Most of the arabinoxylan-hydrolysing bacteria isolated during malting could be assigned to Sphingobacterium species. Genetic fingerprinting revealed shifts in S. multivorum populations during the process, especially during germination. Furthermore, the xylanase produced by an isolate showing the highest activity (identified as Cellulomonas flavigena) was partially purified and characterised with respect to temperature stability, revealing a relatively thermostable enzyme. A filtration assay which is relevant to current brewing practices, was successfully applied to study the lautering performance of kilned malts. Addition of commercially available, thermostable xylanases at mashing-in was highly efficient to increase the wort filtration rate, especially when GH 10 xylanases were applied. Besides direct application in mashing, the addition of exogenous GH 10 xylanase during barley germination also resulted in improved lautering performance. Furthermore, the addition of two xylanolytic bacteria (Cellulomonas flavigena or Enterococcus casseliflavus), originating from malting barley, into the steeping or germination process resulted in an increased wort filtration rate without negative effects on malting performance or on standard malt quality characteristics. This knowledge opens up new perspectives for the application of xylanolytic bacteria during steeping or germination on an industrial scale. In conclusion, this doctoral study contributes to the existing body of knowledge of bacterial diversity during malting and leads to a better understanding of the role of bacteria in the malting process. In particular, this study may provide a basis for microbiota management during malting, aiming at an increased mash filtration rate since introducing more xylanase activity in the malting/brewing process shows high potential in this respect. As improved wort filtration is linked to lower heat load and reduced production of aldehydes, it may ultimately also result in enhanced beer flavour quality, including flavour stability. nrpages: 184 status: publishe...|$|E

Analytical procedures were developed {{and applied to}} extract and quantify these alkaloids from malt, green malt, malt roots, and raw barley. A ground malt sample under nitrogen atmosphere was extracted with 5 percent concentrated ammonium hydroxide in methanol {{at room temperature for}} 24 hours. After purification, the extracted alkaloids were quantitated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography using both phosphate buffer and ion-pairing solvent systems. The recoveries obtained for the alkaloids listed were, respectively, 77. 4, 92. 0, 74. 0 and 80. 5 percent with detection limit of 0. 2, 0. 2, 0. 1 and 0. 1 μg/gm. Conformation of identity of each alkaloid was accomplished by TLC, UV, and MS. Twenty-three samples of kilned malts, five samples of green malts, ten samples of <b>kilned</b> <b>malt</b> roots, five samples of green malt roots, and ten raw barley samples, from a total of 11 varieties of Hordeum vulgare were analyzed for the alkaloids of interest. N-Methyltyramine was found in every sample from all sources with a mean and range, respectively, of 26. 8 (15. 7 - 48. 5), 21. 4 (11. 6 - 37. 5), 1959. 8 (1358. 4 - 2798. 4), 1532. 5 (962. 3 - 2091. 1) and 4. 7 μg/gm (0. 4 - 17. 9 μg/gm) on a dry weight basis. The means and ranges for hordenine were, respectively, 28. 1 (8. 9 - 42. 4), 21. 2 (9. 6 - 35. 5), 4066. 4 (2741. 2 - 5180. 1), 3363. 3 (1956. 2 - 4744. 3) and 0. 7 μg/gm (0. 5 - 1. 0 μg/gm). Gramine was found in only two barley malt varieties examined where kilned and green malts contained, respectively, mean values and ranges of 7. 4 (4. 9 - 10. 0) and 6. 0 μg/gm (4. 7 - 7. 3 μg/gm). N-Methyl- 3 -aminomethylindole was not detected in any of the samples examined. The results of this investigation indicated that the variety of barley affected alkaloid production during malting. The results also showed that the kilning step of the malting process increased the total amount of each alkaloid produced. Finally, room temperature nitrosation of five varieties of kilned and green malts, in which the contents of hordenine and gramine were known, was carried out with an excess of nitrite in acetic acid at pH 3. 2 for 18 hours. The amounts of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) obtained from this nitrosation were far greater than the expected yields for NDMA from the hordenine and gramine present in the malts. The results strongly suggest that the alkaloids hordenine and gramine were not the only precursors for NDMA and that there must be additional precursors; dimethylamine was suggested as a possibility...|$|E
