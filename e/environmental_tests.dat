5|$|From 1969 until 1987, {{the eastern}} {{terminus}} of Route 25 {{was at a}} junction with Maple Springs Road, US 6 and Route 28 in Wareham near the modern location of Exit 2. The MassDPW and the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) had plans to extend the freeway eastward to Cape Cod as early as 1953, when the route {{was included in the}} proposed Cape Cod Expressway that would connect New York City with Cape Cod. Route 25 was originally planned to connect to the Sagamore Bridge, which carried US 6 over the Cape Cod Canal and was used to access the towns of Hyannis and Provincetown. In 1962, however, the MassDPW conducted traffic studies on the two bridges crossing the canal and found that the Sagamore Bridge was above vehicular capacity, whereas the more southern Bourne Bridge had excess capacity. The Route 25 freeway was then redesigned to cross over the Bourne Bridge and connect with the Mid-Cape Highway (US 6) on the southern side of the canal via the proposed Southside Connector. The connector would have been constructed through the Massachusetts Military Reservation in Bourne, but was canceled by the MassDPW and MassHighway in 1977 when <b>environmental</b> <b>tests</b> indicated the freeway would disturb underground aquifers serving as water sources for the region. MassDPW instead changed the proposed eastern terminus of the Route 25 expressway to the approach ramps of the Bourne Bridge.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the types of marine weapons used in response to diverse hostile threats. However, because marine weapons are only tested under a single set of environmental conditions, failures due to different environmental stresses have been difficult to detect. Hence, this study proposes an <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> sequence for multi-environment <b>testing.</b> The <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> sequences for electrical units described in the international standard IEC 60068 - 1, and for military supply described in the United States national standard MIL-STD- 810 G were investigated to propose guidelines for the appropriate test sequences. This study demonstrated the need for tests in multiple environments by investigating marine weapon accidents, and evaluated which <b>environmental</b> stresses and <b>test</b> items have the largest impacts on marine weapons using a two-phase quality function deployment (QFD) analysis of operational scenarios, environmental stresses, and <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> items. Integer programming was used to determine the most influential test items and the shortest <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> time, allowing us to propose optimal test procedures. Based on our analysis, we developed optimal <b>environmental</b> <b>test</b> sequences that could be selected by a test designer...|$|R
