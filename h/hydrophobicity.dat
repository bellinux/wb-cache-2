5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} encoded {{directly}} by the genetic code {{can be divided into}} several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or <b>hydrophobicity,</b> size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried {{in the middle of the}} protein, whereas hydrophilic side chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. (Note that in biochemistry, a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide, protein or nucleic acid.) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine. There are different <b>hydrophobicity</b> scales of amino acid residues.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} <b>hydrophobicity</b> of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The water drops maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E
25|$|V. rotundifolia fruits {{have been}} shown to {{transfer}} cuticular alkanes to the sand substrate. This results in intense sand <b>hydrophobicity</b> that persists in the soil for many years. This <b>hydrophobicity</b> might negatively impact dune recovery or serve as a means for limiting growth of native plant species.|$|E

Water {{contact angles}} (<b>hydrophobicities)</b> were {{calculated}} from automated contact angle measurements (OCA 15 plus; Dataphysics Instruments, Filderstadt, Germany) with deionized water. Nine drops {{of the liquid}} (one drop 1  μl) were examined on each substratum, and the contact angle was measured exactly 15  s after the positioning of the drop.|$|R
25|$|HIC {{media is}} amphiphilic, with both {{hydrophobic}} and hydrophilic regions, allowing {{for separation of}} proteins based on their surface <b>hydrophobicity.</b> In pure water, the interactions between the resin and the hydrophobic regions of protein would be very weak, but this interaction is enhanced by applying a protein sample to HIC resin in high ionic strength buffer. The ionic strength of the buffer is then reduced to elute proteins in order of decreasing <b>hydrophobicity.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrophobicity</b> {{can also}} affect {{the ability of}} {{bacteria}} to form biofilms. Bacteria with increased <b>hydrophobicity</b> have reduced repulsion between the extracellular matrix and the bacterium. Some bacteria species {{are not able to}} attach to a surface on their own successfully due to their limited motility but are instead able to anchor themselves to the matrix or directly to other, earlier bacteria colonists. Non-motile bacteria cannot recognize surfaces or aggregate together as easily as motile bacteria.|$|E

40|$|Film {{flotation}} is {{a process}} which consumes much lower energy than mechanical cells. The extended film flotation technique is to separate mineral mixtures by different critical impact velocities. In this study the maximum penetration depth of a particle at its critical condition was investigated experimentally and theoretically. Experiments were performed using spherical glass beads of different diameters and <b>hydrophobicities</b> and different liquids. The penetration depth at critical condition was recorded and measured using high speed video camera. Buckingham’s PI theorem was applied to analyse the dimensionless groups, and then an empirical correlation for penetration depth was obtained by partial least squares method. It {{was found that the}} prediction results of the empirical equation were in good agreement with the measurements. Also, the influence factors were analysed. It was noticed that the <b>hydrophobicities</b> of particle and particle-liquid density ratio had most significant effects on the penetration depth...|$|R

25|$|The {{partition}} coefficient (Log P) {{is a measure}} of differential solubility of a compound in a hydrophobic solvent (1-octanol) and a hydrophilic solvent (water). The logarithm of these two values enables compounds to be ranked in terms of hydrophilicity (or <b>hydrophobicity).</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly how these {{proteins}} can translocate {{such a wide}} variety of drugs, however one model (the hydrophobic vacuum cleaner model) states that, in P-glycoprotein, the drugs are bound indiscriminately from the lipid phase based on their <b>hydrophobicity.</b>|$|E
40|$|Several {{synthetic}} carbonaceous adsorbents produced through pyrolysis of {{polymeric materials}} are available commercially. Some {{appear to have}} advantages over activated carbon for certain adsorption applications. In particular, they can have tailored <b>hydrophobicities</b> that are significantly {{greater than that of}} activated carbon, while moderately high surfaces areas are retained. These sorbents are being investigated for possible use in removing trace contaminants and excess carbon dioxide from air in closed habitats, plant growth chambers, and other applications involving purification of humid gas streams. We have analyzed the characteristics of a few of these adsorbents through adsorption and desorption experiments and standard characterization techniques. This paper presents pure and multicomponent adsorption data collected for carbon dioxide and water on two synthetic carbonaceous adsorbents having different <b>hydrophobicities</b> and capillary condensation characteristics. The observations are interpreted through consideration of the pore structure and surface chemistry of the solids and interactions between adsorbed carbon dioxide, water, and the solvent gas...|$|R

25|$|Because {{of their}} low vapour pressure, PCBs {{accumulate}} {{primarily in the}} hydrosphere, despite their <b>hydrophobicity,</b> in the organic fraction of soil, and in organisms. The hydrosphere is the main reservoir. The immense volume {{of water in the}} oceans is still capable of dissolving a significant quantity of PCBs.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hydrophobicity</b> of a {{compound}} can give scientists {{an indication of}} how easily {{a compound}} might be taken up in groundwater to pollute waterways, and its toxicity to animals and aquatic life. Partition coefficient can also used to predict the mobility of radionuclides in groundwater. In the field of hydrogeology, the octanol-water partition coefficient, or Kow, is used to predict and model the migration of dissolved hydrophobic organic compounds in soil and groundwater.|$|E

The SUMOplot score system is based on two criteria: 1) direct amino acid match to the SUMO-CS observed and shown to bind Ubc9, and 2) substitution of the consensus amino acid residues with amino acid residues exhibiting similar <b>hydrophobicity.</b> SUMOplot has been used in the past to predict Ubc9 dependent sites.|$|E

Among other things, {{they can be used}} to increase the water solubility of hydrophobic, oily substances or otherwise increase the miscibility of two substances with different <b>hydrophobicities.</b> For this reason, these polymers are commonly used in industrial applications, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals. They have also been evaluated for various drug delivery applications and were shown to sensitize drug resistant cancers to chemotherapy.|$|R

A <b>hydrophobicity</b> plot lacking any patterns which are common to possible membrane-spanning domains. The structures of other multimeric membrane proteins (such as diphtheria toxin) provide the answer to how PA manages to span the membrane. It is thought that PA acts like these multimeric membrane proteins that form β-barrels made from stretchs of both polar and non-polar amino acids from each monomer.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} can be functionalized {{to attain}} desired properties {{that can be}} used in a wide variety of applications. The two main methods of carbon nanotube functionalization are covalent and non-covalent modifications. Because of their hydrophobic nature, carbon nanotubes tend to agglomerate hindering their dispersion in solvents or viscous polymer melts. The resulting nanotube bundles or aggregates reduce the mechanical performance of the final composite. The surface of the carbon nanotubes can be modified to reduce the <b>hydrophobicity</b> and improve interfacial adhesion to a bulk polymer through chemical attachment.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{containing}} the protein complement desired are grown. Proteins are then {{extracted from the}} mixture and digested with a protease to produce a peptide mixture. The peptide mixture is then loaded directly onto a microcapillary column and the peptides are separated by <b>hydrophobicity</b> and charge. As the peptides elute from the column, they are ionized and separated by m/z {{in the first stage}} of tandem mass spectrometry. The selected ions undergo collision-induced dissociation or other process to induce fragmentation. The charged fragments are separated in the second stage of tandem mass spectrometry.|$|E

All new isolates were highly hydrophobic, indicating that the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor concept selects for hydrophobic bacteria. Methanothrix soehngenii, a methanogen often observed in methanogenic granular sludge, was highly hydrophobic and showed low electrophoretic mobility at pH 7. The role of this strain in the formation of methanogenic granular sludge is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Two major antigens of Bordetella pertussis, {{filamentous}} hemagglutinin (FHA) and {{pertussis toxin}} (PT), were efficiently purified from culture filtrate by exploiting their relative <b>hydrophobicities</b> {{and differences in}} affinity to sialic acid-containing protein. High yields of FHA (40 to 80 mg/liter) and PT (8 to 16 mg/liter) were first produced by growing the bacteria in the modified CL medium. The FHA and PT in the culture filtrate were adsorbed onto butyl-Sepharose by hydrophobic interaction at appropriately high ionic strength. Elution of the antigens was effected by decreasing their <b>hydrophobicities</b> with a buffer of low ionic strength. FHA was then separated from PT with an affinity column of fetuin-Sepharose. The fraction passing through the column contained purified FHA, and the fetuin-bound PT was eluted with buffered MgCl 2. The FHA and PT purified by these steps were electrophoretically and serologically identical to the reference purified FHA and PT preparations. Approximately 16 to 32 mg of purified FHA and 4 to 8 mg of purified PT were obtained from 1 liter of culture filtrate. The described procedure for making FHA and PT antigens from B. pertussis for serologic and immunologic use is very simple, efficient, and reproducible...|$|R
40|$|Taste and odor causing organic {{compounds}} {{of concern to}} the general public are produced at low concentrations (i. e., ng/L) in surface water. Bench-scale membrane filtration experiments were conducted with 2, 4, 6 -trichloroanisole (TCA), which is of special interest as a model compound due to its very low odor threshold level (i. e., 10 ng/L). Four different tight ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, with different molecular weight cutoffs (MWCO) and <b>hydrophobicities</b> were investigated. The removal of TCA decreased with increasing permeability for all of the UF membranes tested. Relatively hydrophobic UF membranes, even those with higher MWCO and permeability values, exhibited much higher TCA removal efficiencies than relatively hydrophilic UF membranes, both in the presence and absence of hydrophobic natural organic matter (Suwannee River NOM). The adsorption of TCA onto the membrane surfaces/pores through the hydrophobic interaction was found to be important for the efficient removals of TCA by hydrophobic UF membranes, especially those with greater <b>hydrophobicities.</b> The removals of TCA by the tight-UF membranes were affected by two major mechanisms: (1) a convection mechanism for the transmission of TCA through the membrane pores and (2) the adsorption of TCA onto the membrane surfaces/pores through hydrophobic interactionsclose 141...|$|R

Subsequently, in 1988, MIM tested the flotation of a stream of fine lead-bearing particles in a conventional mechanical flotation cell, a conventional column and the Jameson Cell. The Cell gave the best recoveries. This {{was thought to be}} a combination of the short residence time of the particles in the Cell {{and the fact that the}} <b>hydrophobicity</b> of the lead particles decreased over time.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the {{similarity}} of different amino acid sequences {{has been the most}} common method of inferring homology. Sequence similarity is considered a good predictor of relatedness, since similar sequences are more likely the result of gene duplication and divergent evolution, rather than the result of convergent evolution. Amino acid sequence is typically more conserved than DNA sequence (due to the degenerate genetic code), so is a more sensitive detection method. Since some of the amino acids have similar properties (e.g., charge, <b>hydrophobicity,</b> size), conservative mutations that interchange them are often neutral to function. The most conserved sequence regions of a protein often correspond to functionally important regions like catalytic sites and binding sites, since these regions are less tolerant to sequence changes.|$|E

The CCDC130 protein is rich in charged amino acids and deficient in uncharged, non-polar amino acids. Mobyle @ Pasteur predicted CCDC130 to be extremely hydrophilic due to {{the large numbers of}} charged and polar amino acids, with no site scoring above zero on the <b>hydrophobicity</b> graph and some sites reaching as low as -6 (F180). There is a region in the coiled coil domain (182-214) in which 14 of 18 amino acids are charged. SAPS analysis predicted that this protein would be unstable. Due to its high hydrophilicity, this protein definitely does not contain transmembrane segments.|$|E
