40|$|We {{report a}} novel method for rapid {{quantification}} {{of the degree}} of DNA methylation of a specific gene. Our method combined bisulfite-mediated PCR and quantification of <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (dNMP) contents in the PCR product through capillary electrophoresis. A specific bisulfite-PCR product was enzymatically hydrolyzed to dNMP monomers which were quantitatively analyzed through subsequent capillary electrophoresis. PCR following bisulfite treatment converts unmethylated cytosines to thymines while leaving methyl-cytosines unchanged. Then the ratio of cytosine to thymine determined by capillary electrophoresis represents the ratio of methyl-cytosine to cytosine in genomic locus of interest. Pure oligonucleotides with known sequences were processed in parallel as standards for normalization of dNMP peaks in capillary electrophoresis. Sources of quantification uncertainty such as carryovers of dNTPs or primers and incomplete hydrolysis were examined and ruled out. When the method was applied to samples with known methylation levels (by bisulfite-mediated sequencing) as a validation, deviations were within ± 5 %. After bisulfite-PCR, the analytical procedure can be completed within 1. 5 h...|$|E

In 15 -min incubations, <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> {{had no effect}} or stimulated [3 H]DNA binding, depending on the concentration. The uptake of radioactivity from [3 H]DNA resulted in little accumulation of trichloroacetic acid-soluble intracellular radioactivity and was inhibited by the DNA synthesis inhibitor novobiocin. Molecular fractionation studies indicated that some radioactivity from [3 H]DNA appeared in the RNA (10 and 30 % at 4 and 24 h, respectively) and protein (approximately 3 %) fractions. The ability of estuarine microbial assemblages to transport gene sequences was investigated by plasmid uptake studies, followed by molecular probing. Although plasmid DNA was detected on filters after filtration of plasmid-amended incubations, DNase treatment of filters removed this DNA, indicating {{that there was little}} transport of intact gene sequences. These observations led to the following model for DNA utilization by estuarine microbial populations. (i) DNA is rapidly bound to the cell surface and (ii) hydrolyzed by cell-associated and extracellular nonspecific nucleases. (iii) DNA hydrolysis products are transported, and (iv) the products are rapidly salvaged into nucleic acids, with little accumulation into intracellular nucleotide pools...|$|R

We demonstrate that bdellovibrios, in contrast to almost all other bacteria, take up these nucleoside monophosphates into the cell in an intact, phosphorylated form. In this way {{they are able to}} assimilate more effectively the cellular contents of their prey. Studies with UMP and dTMP demonstrate that they are transported and accumulated against a concentration gradient, achieving internal levels at least 10 times the external levels. Treatment of the bdellovibrios with azide or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone eliminates their ability to either transport or maintain accumulated UMP and suggests the presence of a freely reversible exchange mechanism. There are at least two separate classes of transport systems for nucleoside monophosphates, each exhibiting partial specificity for either ribonucleoside <b>monophosphates</b> or <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates.</b> Kinetic analyses of UMP transport in different developmental stages of strain 109 J indicate that each stage expresses a single, saturable uptake system with a distinct apparent substrate affinity constant (Kt) of 104 microM in attack phase cells and 35 microM in prematurely released growth phase filaments. The capacity for transport of UMP by the growth phase filaments was 2. 4 times that of the attack phase cells.

40|$|Deoxyribonucleoside {{triphosphates}} (dNTPs) are {{the building}} blocks of DNA and can be synthesized either de novo or via salvage pathways. The first reaction in the salvage pathway of dNTPs is the conversion of deoxyribonucleosides (dN) into the <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate</b> (dNMP). The corresponding enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs), are also important for the activation of many nucleoside analogs used in anti-viral and anti-cancer therapy. Nucleoside analogs mimic the natural DNA precursors and can interfere, as antimetabolites, with DNA synthesis leading to cell-death. In this thesis I studied the diversity of deoxyribonucleoside kinases in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Several of the microbial deoxyribonucleoside kinases were over-expressed, purified and characterized for their substrate specificity, kinetics and structure function relationship. Nucleoside analogs were studied for their antibacterial potential and we show in this study that microbial deoxyribonucleoside kinases could activate nucleoside analogs, like 3 ’-azido-thymidine (AZT) in Gram-negative bacteria, and 2 ’, 2 ’-difluorodeoxycytidine in Gram-positive bacteria. Human thymidine kinase 1 (TK 1) has a very strict substrate specificity, and via a random mutagenesis approach I identified mutants with an increased selectivity towards nucleoside analogs, like AZT and 5 -ethyl-deoxyuridine. I show that a decrease of kcat for thymidine is the main reason that TK 1 mutants sensitize the host against analogs. Several animal and bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases have so far been thoroughly investigated, but the salvage of deoxyribonucleosides in plants is so far largely unknown. Here, I show that plants salvage deoxyribonucleosides mainly in the mitochondria and our plant model Arabidopsis thaliana contains two TK 1 s and an ancestor-like multisubstrate dNK.

Among its side effects, phototoxic and photoallergic reactions are reported in treated patients inadvertently exposed to sunlight and higher efficacy against actinic keratosis was found when affected areas are exposed to irradiation. 5 -FU and its <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate</b> are known to undergo photodegradation under UVC and UVB light. Therefore the drug itself and its formulations are suggested to be protected from light. Phototoxicity was studied in vitro on NCTC- 2544 and 3 T 3 cell lines. The photoallergic potential was evaluated through photosensitization reactions to model amino acids and proteins. Experiments in cancerous 5 -FU resistant MCF- 7 cell lines were performed in order to assess the antiproliferative effect of 5 -FU in combination with UVB light. The photostability of 5 -FU parenteral and topical formulations and the consequences of photolysis on therapeutic activity have been also evaluated. We have demonstrated that photolysis of 5 -FU caused loss of its antiproliferative activity in HCT- 15 and HeLa tumor cell lines sensitive to 5 -FU. Moreover, a slight in vitro phototoxicity of 5 -FU was detected on NCTC- 2544 and 3 T 3 cell lines. The nucleophilic addition of amino acids and peptides (i. e. serine, cysteine, angiotensin fragment) to the 5, 6 double bond of 5 -FU (detected by Mass Spectrometry) as well as photooxidation of proteins (BSA carbonyl content assay) were shown, possibly explaining the occurrence of photoallergy and other undesired light–induced side effects of this drug. A little improvement of the antiproliferative activity of 5 -FU in combination with UVB irradiation on MCF- 7 resistant cells was also evidenced, but not enough effective to justify its use as a phototherapeutic agent...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{replication}} is a semiconservative {{process in}} which a DNA polymerase uses one DNA strand as a template for the synthesis of a second, complementary, DNA strand. However, in contrast to RNA polymerases, which can initiate RNA synthesis on a DNA template de novo, all DNA polymerases require a preexisting primer on which to initiate DNA synthesis (Kornberg and Baker 1992). One apparent exception to this rule is a mitochondria 1 DNA (mtDNA) -encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) in Neurospora (Wang and Lambowitz 1993). Preexisting primers can be classified into four groups. The simplest primer consists of the 3 '-hydroxyl (3 '-OH) termini of DNA chains that are complementary to the DNA template and thereby form a stable duplex structure at the site where DNA synthesis begins. This primer is used for DNA repair (Friedberg and Wood, this volume), parvovirus DNA replication (Brush and Kelly; Cotmore and Tattersall; both this volume), some RTs. The second type of primer consists of a <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphate</b> that is covalently attached to a specific serine, threonine, or tyrosine residue of a protein. Examples are bacteriophage, plasmids, and animal viruses that replicate as a linear DNA genome, and animal viruses such as hepadnaviruses whose genome is partially doublestranded and partially single-stranded. The third type of primer consists of tRNA molecules that anneal to specific sequences in the RNA The fourth class of primers consists of nascent RNA chains. These comprise nascent RNA transcripts that are processed to create a primer at a specific site in the template and short nascent oligoribonucleotides (initiator RNA) that are synthesized at many sites in the template and rapidly extended into short RNA-DNA primers by DNA polymerase-a:DNA primase (pol-a:primase). Nascent RNA transcripts are used during initiation of mtDNA replication, whereas replication forks in cellular chromosomes and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viral genomes that replicate within the nucleus use the initiator RNA mechanism.

40|$|We have cloned {{the gene}} for polyphosphate:AMP {{phosphotransferase}} (PAP), the enzyme that catalyzes phosphorylation of AMP to ADP {{at the expense of}} polyphosphate [poly(P) ] in Acinetobacter johnsonii 210 A. A genomic DNA library was constructed in Escherichia coli, and crude lysates of about 6, 000 clones were screened for PAP activity. PAP activity was evaluated by measuring ATP produced by the coupled reactions of PAP and purified E. coli poly(P) kinases (PPKs). In this coupled reaction, PAP produces ADP from poly(P) and AMP, and the resulting ADP is converted to ATP by PPK. The isolated pap gene (1, 428 bp) encodes a protein of 475 amino acids with a molecular mass of 55. 8 kDa. The C-terminal region of PAP is highly homologous with PPK 2 homologs isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO 1. Two putative phosphate-binding motifs (P-loops) were also identified. The purified PAP enzyme had not only strong PAP activity but also poly(P) -dependent nucleoside monophosphate kinase activity, by which it converted ribonucleoside <b>monophosphates</b> and <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> to ribonucleoside diphosphates and deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates, respectively.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{contribution}} of mismatch sequences to the trinucleotide repeat expansion that causes hereditary diseases. Using an oligonucleotide duplex, (CAG) 5 /(CTG) 5, as a template-primer, DNA synthesis was carried out using either Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) or human immunodeficiency virus type I reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT). Both enzymes expanded the repeat sequence longer than 27 nucleotides (nt), beyond the maximum length expected from the template size. The expansion was observed under conditions in which extension occurs either in both strands or in one strand. In contrast, with another template-primer that contains a non-repetitive flanking sequence 5 '-upstream of the repetitive sequence, the reaction products were not extended beyond the template size (45 nt) by these DNA polymerases. We then used mismatched template-primers, in which either 1, 2 or 6 non-complementary nucleotides {{were introduced to the}} repeat sequence that is flanked by a non-repetitive sequence. In this case, primers were efficiently expanded over the expected length of 45 nt, in a mismatch-dependent manner. One of the primers with six mismatches extended as long as 72 nt. These results imply that the misincorporation of non-complementary <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> (dNMPs) into the repeat sequence makes double-stranded DNA unstable and triggers the slippage and expansion of trinucleotide repeats by forming loops or hairpin structures during DNA synthesis...|$|R

Incorporation of each of these labeled compounds was not dependent upon the addition of the other deoxyribonucleotide precursors, suggesting that a functioning de novo pathway to deoxyribonucleotides was being monitored. The second pathway or reaction required all four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates or the <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> together with ATP. However, in this reaction, dTTP was not replaced by TdR. The two pathways were also distinguished {{on the basis of their}} apparent Mg 2 + requirements and responses to N-ethylmaleimide, micrococcal nuclease, and to hydroxyurea, which is a specific inhibitor of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase. Separate products were synthesized by the two channels, as shown by density-gradient experiments and velocity sedimentation analysis. Each of the pathways required the products of the T 4 DNA synthesis genes. Furthermore, DNA synthesis by each pathway appeared to be coupled to the functioning of several of the phage-induced enzymes involved in deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis. Both systems represent replicative phage DNA synthesis as determined by CsCl density-gradient analysis. Autoradiographic and other studies provided evidence that both pathways occur in the same cell. Further studies were carried out on the direct role of dCMP hydroxymethylase in T 4 DNA replication.

The separation of common and modified deoxyribonucleosides derived from DNA hydrolyzates was examined under different chromatographic conditions on silica-based octadecyl (C 18) columns, involving hydrophobic interactions with the matrix. A novel method for the analysis of the DNA composition is described. It involves the removal of RNA contaminants and enzymatic hydrolysis of DNA, first to <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> and then dephosphorylation of the latter to deoxyribonucleosides. Hydrolysis conditions were sought to avoid deamination of dA and dC residues to dI and dU contaminants, respectively. Elution of these contaminants and the artifacts (ribonucleosides derived from RNA) is described in relation to the elution of deoxyribonucleosides. Chromatographic separation of the hydrolyzate derived from a 15 -micrograms sample of DNA under selected separation conditions and on one high-performance liquid chromatographic column is achieved in 18 min at room temperature. Detection of modified components (and contaminants) present in minute amounts is enhanced {{with the use of a}} diode-array detector. The power of this technique lies in its ability to characterize and quantitate accurately the amount of modified species present in the DNA structure (less than 2 % of all the other residues). Examples of the composition analysis of DNA derived from a prokaryote (Escherichia coli B) and a eukaryote (salmon sperm) are described.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 This {{dissertation}} {{describes an}} investigation of DNA precursor supply for mitochondrial and nuclear DNA synthesis in HeLa cells and Mouse L-cells. HeLa cells {{were used for the}} quantitation of cellular and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) and ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP) pools and of changes in pools in response to treatment with the antimetabolites methotrexate (mtx) and 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR). Use of an enzymatic assay for dNTPs and of improved nucleotide extraction methods allowed quantitation of mitochondrial dNTP pools. All four mitochondrial dNTP pools expand following treatment with mtx or FUdR whereas cellular dTTP and dGTP pools are depleted. Mitochondrial rNTP pools were also found to expand in response to these antimetabolites. The cellular dGTP pool is severely depleted by mtx and FUdR' which indicates dGTP levels might {{play an important role in}} mtx- and FUdR-induced cytotoxicity. Mouse L-cells were used to determine the relative contributions of an exogenously supplied precursor to nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication. These experiments provide a dynamic representation of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA precusor metabolism. Cells were labeled to near steady state specific activities with ³²P-orthophosphate and subsequently labeled with [³H]uridine, a general pyrimidine precursor, in the continuing presence of ³²P. Cells were harvested at time intervals up to four days after [³H]uridine addition and mitochondrial and nuclear DNAs were purified. <b>Deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> derived from these DNAs were separated by HPLC and the ³H/ ³²P ratio in each pyrimidine determined.

The dTMP residues from nuclear and mtDNA and the dCMP residues from nuclear DNA were seen to be synthesized partly from exogenous sources and partly from other sources, presumably de novo pyrimidine synthesis. The results suggest mtDNA replication can utilize exogenous dCTP precursors more efficiently than nuclear replication.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), {{building blocks of}} DNA, {{can be achieved by}} two different pathways in the cell. One is called de novo synthesis and the other is known as salvage pathway. The de novo pathway involves {{synthesis of}} dNTPs by utilizing basic molecules like sugars, amino acids, CO 2, NH 3, etc., while in the other pathway, dNTPs are formed by salvaging intra- or extra-cellular deoxyribonucleosides (dNs). Deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs) catalyze the rate-limiting step of the nucleoside salvage pathway by converting the dNs into the corresponding <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates</b> and {{play an important role in}} maintaining the balanced dNTP pools in the cell. Furthermore, dNKs show a great deal of multiplicity among different organisms and present an excellent choice to study different evolutionary phenomena, such as, the origin of regulatory activities and gene/enzyme duplication. The present study deals with the characterization of different dNKs in order to understand their structure-function relationship, substrate specificities and evolutionary history. The ‘ATP-induced’ dimer/tetramer shift on thymidine kinase 1 (TK 1) from different organisms was studied to comprehend the evolutionary origin of oligomerization based regulation of TK 1. The results suggested that the dimer form is the original form and the tetramer form has originated in early animals to serve as a fine-tuning mechanism for the regulation of TK 1 activity. In addition, the evolutionary background of various dNKs was studied. An apparent duplication of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) in some vertebrates and loss of deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) in one of the bird families were observed. The kinetic properties of the recombinant dCK/dGK-like enzymes from an amphibian, Xenopus laevis, and a bird, Gallus gallus, were determined and the sub-cellular localization of these enzymes was predicted. It seems that substrate specificity and sub-cellular localization are the likely biological forces behind vertebrate dCK/dGK evolution. Finally, the dNK activities in sub-cellular fractions of plants, Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum tuberosum, were analyzed and the results showed that most of the plant dNK activity mainly occurs in mitochondria, but not in chloroplasts...|$|R

The predicted primarystructures of human dCK, dGK and TK 2 are = 30 % similar, and these enzymes are sequence-relatedto both viral and prokaryotic deoxyribonucleoside kinases. The cloning of the deoxyribonucleosidekinases provides the basis for studies on their structures, substrate specificity,and activation of novel therapeutic nucleoside analogs. The genes that encode human dGK and TK 2 are located at chromosomes 2 pl 3 and 16 q 22,respectively. The chromosome regions are associated with several human diseases,and the regions show allelic rearrangements or deletions in certain malignant tumours. There are, however, no obvious phenotypic features that suggest involvement of thedeoxyribonucleoside kinases in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Toxicity of dCK phosphorylated nucleoside analogs differ between human and mousecells. We have identified differences in kinetic properties of recombinant humanand mouse dCK for both deoxyribonucleosides, nucleoside analogs, and phosphate donorsthat may be determinants of the species differences observed in vivo. We cloned the complete mouse dCK gene and determined its structure to enable futurestudies on the physiological importance of dCK by gene targeting experiments in transgenicmice. To study the transcription regulation of dCK, we cloned and determined theDNA sequences of = 1. 7 kbp upstream of both the human and mouse dCK genes. This regioncontained five major interspecies sequence conserved regions that included the transcriptionstart site and an SP 1 binding site.

Structurally modified precursors of deoxyribonucleotides, i. e. nucleoside analogs, {{are used as}} anti-viral and anti-cancer compounds. The deoxyribonucleosides and the nucleoside analogs are phosphorylated to the triphosphate form in three subsequent phosphorylation steps, that are catalyzed by nucleoside kinases, nucleoside monophosphate kinases and nucleoside diphosphate kinases. Five of these enzymes have been cloned and characterized in this thesis. Deoxyribonucleoside kinases catalyze the phosphorylation of <b>deoxyribonucleosides</b> to <b>deoxyribonucleoside</b> <b>monophosphates.</b> We have cloned and expressed the cDNA of the Drosophila melanogaster deoxyribonucleoside kinase. This enzyme showed a broader substrate specificity and higher catalytic rate compared to the human enzymes and the herpes simplex virus type- 1 thymidine kinase. The enzyme phosphorylated all four natural deoxyribonucleosides {{as well as several}} nucleoside analogs. The broad substrate specificity and high catalytic rate of Dm-dNK makes this enzyme an interesting candidate for suicide gene therapy. Two human uridine-cytidine kinases (UCK) were cloned and shown to catalyze the phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine to their monophosphate forms. UCK 1 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in twelve different human tissues, whereas human UCK 2 mRNA was detected only in placenta. The genes encoding UCK 1 and UCK 2 were mapped to chromosome 9 q 34. 2 - 9 q 34. 3 and lq 22 -lq 23. 2, respectively. We tested 28 cytidine and uridine nucleoside analogs and several of these were shown to be substrates of the enzymes. UCK 1 and UCK 2 were overexpressed in a Chinese hamster ovary cancer cell line to determine the importance of UCK mediated nucleoside analog phosphorylation. The transfected cells showed a nuclear and cytosolic location for UCK 1 and UCK 2, respectively. The UCK 1 and UCK 2 overexpressed cell line exhibited increased sensitivity to several analogs. Our data imply that UCK 1 and UCK 2 activity are ratelimiting for the efficacy of some ribonucleoside analogs in the cell line investigated. Nucleoside monophosphate kinases catalyze the second phosphorylation step, from the monophosphate to the diphosphate form. A novel human adenylate kinase, AK 5, was cloned and shown to be predominantly expressed in brain. The enzyme phosphorylated AMP and dAMP with ATP as phosphate donor. The gene that encoded this cytosolic enzyme was localized to chromosome 1 p 3 1. The cytosolic human UMPCMP kinase was cloned and characterized. The UMP-CMP kinase phosphorylated CMP, dCMP, UMP and dUMP and also the nucleoside analogs dFdC-MP, AraC-MP and ddC-MP. UMP-CMP kinase mRNA was ubiquitously present in human tissues. The human UMP-CMP kinase gene was localized to chromosome 1 p 34 1 - 1 p 33. The cloning, recombinant expression and characterization of these five nucleoside and nucleotide kinases will allow the pathways of nucleoside and nucleoside analog metabolism to be outlined in more detail. Knowledge of the metabolic pathways will be important for the development of novel ribonucleoside- and deoxyribonucleoside analogs and for the characterization of their pharmacological activation in different tissues...|$|R
