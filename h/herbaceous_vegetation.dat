5|$|Vegetation: Most of {{the spray}} zone {{adjacent}} to the Falls is covered with patches of various mosses, liverworts, and other low <b>herbaceous</b> <b>vegetation,</b> including Eutrochium purpureum, Angelica atropurpurea, and Aster spp. In addition, watercress Nasturtium officinale increased after the 1993 flood event. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found on vegetation up to 92cm above the ground and at 1/3 the maximum sunlight intensities of the sympatric Succinea sp. B. Vegetation is quite sparse {{on the west side}} of the Falls, and the only snails that have been observed there are Succinea sp. B. In drier talus {{adjacent to the}} mossy areas are various plant species, such as eastern skunk cabbage Symplocarpus foetidus and Angelica atropurpurea, upon which Succinea sp. B has also been found. During periods of heavy water flow, dew, or rain, when the vegetation is saturated, the snails have been observed actively crawling on the vegetation. During drier times, both species of snails attach themselves to the underside of leaves with a mucous epiphragm. In the patch of watercress, the vegetation is dense and lush. Although the watercress is dominant, other species include Angelica atropurpurea, jewelweed Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida, forget-me-nots Myosotis scorpioides, various mints Mentha spp., and poison ivy Toxicodendron radicans, which again support Succinea sp. B but not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The ledges where Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found clearly comprise an early successional sere, periodically rejuvenated to a bare rock substrate by flood waters.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of soil formation, the bare rock out crops is gradually colonized by pioneer species (lichens and mosses). They are succeeded by <b>herbaceous</b> <b>vegetation,</b> shrubs and finally forest. In parallel, the first humus-bearing horizon is formed (the A horizon), followed by some mineral horizons (B horizons).

Pelotas is 55km (34mi) from the Atlantic Ocean, and possesses a beach along the Lagoa dos Patos, called Laranjal. In the vicinity of the beach one can find quagmires and sand dunes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Herbaceous</b> <b>vegetation</b> such as {{grasses and}} forbs {{make up the}} {{majority}} of the Amargosa vole’s diet, but they may also rely on roots and seeds throughout certain times of the year. When harvesting the seed heads from grasses and forbs, individuals will often stand on their hind feet and chew off the herbaceous stem, causing the seeds to fall into their reach. Around dusk and dawn is when they are usually most active, but during extremely hot, dry weather, they adjust their foraging strategy to occur mostly at night.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePrevious {{morphological}} and {{isotopic studies}} indicate that Late Pleistocene cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) diet ranged from mostly vegetarian to omnivory or even carnivory. However, such analyses do not provide information on seasonal diets, and only provide an average record of diet. A dental microwear analysis of 43 young and adult individuals demonstrate that, during the predormancy period, cave bears from Goyet (Late Pleistocene, Belgium) were not strictly herbivorous, but had a mixed diet composed of hard items (e. g., possibly bone), invertebrates (e. g., insects), meat (ungulates, small vertebrates), and/or plant matter (hard mast, seeds, <b>herbaceous</b> <b>vegetations,</b> and fruits). Therefore, our results indicate that cave bears at Goyet were generalist omnivores during the predormancy period, {{which is consistent with}} current data on the dietary ecology of extant bears during this season. These data also raise questions about the ecological role and causes of the extinction of cave bears...|$|R

30|$|In this study, we {{evaluated}} shrub and herbaceous cover and density, and ground cover (litter, bio-crust, bare ground) responses to seasonal burning of western juniper in three distinct plant communities in eastern Oregon.

We hypothesized that <b>herbaceous</b> and shrub <b>vegetation</b> and ground cover variables would not be different among seasonal burning or cutting treatments of juniper. Finally, we hypothesized that density of juniper seedlings and saplings would not be different among seasonal burning and cutting treatments of juniper.|$|R
25|$|In {{tropical}} forests, gorillas are hunted {{to provide}} meat for the bushmeat trade. Logging also destroys gorilla habitats. Although logging diminishes gorilla habitats, {{it may also}} provide for increased <b>herbaceous</b> <b>vegetation</b> {{as a result of}} gaps in the tree cover. Destruction of gorilla habitat may harm the overall forest ecosystem. Western lowland gorillas are seed dispersers, which mean they carry seeds from one place to another, and this trait is beneficial to many of the animals in the forest. Therefore, if there are no western lowland gorillas to disperse the needed seeds to other animals, not only will the gorillas become extinct but so will many other animals, which could over time destroy an entire ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Conventional wisdom {{has held}} that beavers girdle and fell trees {{and that they}} {{diminish}} riparian trees and vegetation, but the opposite appears to be true when studies are conducted longer-term. In 1987, Beier reported that beavers had caused local extinction of Quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) and Black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa) on 4–5% of stream reaches on the lower Truckee River in the Sierra Nevada mountains; however willow (Salix spp.) responded by regrowing vigorously in most reaches. He further speculated that without control of beaver populations, aspen and cottonwood could go extinct on the Truckee River. Not only have aspen and cottonwood survived ongoing beaver colonization, but {{a recent study of}} ten Sierra Nevada streams in the Lake Tahoe basin using aerial multispectral videography has also shown that deciduous, thick herbaceous, and thin <b>herbaceous</b> <b>vegetation</b> are more highly concentrated near beaver dams, whereas coniferous trees are decreased. These findings are consistent with those of Pollock, who reported that in Bridge Creek, a stream in semiarid eastern Oregon, the width of riparian vegetation on stream banks was increased several-fold as beaver dams watered previously dry terraces adjacent to the stream. In a second study of riparian vegetation based on observations of Bridge Creek over a 17-year period, although portions of the study reach were periodically abandoned by beaver following heavy utilization of streamside vegetation, within a few years, dense stands of woody plants of greater diversity occupied a larger portion of the floodplain. Although black cottonwood and thinleaf alder did not generally resprout after beaver cutting, they frequently grew from seeds landing on freshly exposed alluvial deposits subsequent to beaver activity. Therefore, beaver appear to increase riparian vegetation given enough years to aggrade sediments and pond heights sufficiently to create widened, well-watered riparian zones, especially in areas of low summer rainfall.|$|E

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the extent of}} ecological impacts of the invasive Asian paper wasp across different landscapes in New Zealand. We used: (i) a baseline distribution layer (modelled via MaxEnt); (ii) Asian paper wasp nest density (from > 460 field plots, related to their preferences for specific land cover categories); and (iii) and their foraging intensity (rates of foraging success, and the time available to forage on a seasonal basis). Using geographic information systems this information is combined and modelled across different landscapes in New Zealand in a step-wise selection process. The highest densities of Asian paper wasps were in <b>herbaceous</b> saline <b>vegetation,</b> followed closely by built-up areas, and then scrub and shrubland. Nest densities of 34 per ha, and occupancy rates of 0. 27 were recorded for <b>herbaceous</b> saline <b>vegetation</b> habitats. However, the extent of impacts of the Asian paper wasp remains relatively restricted because of narrow climate tolerances and spatial restriction of preferred habitats. A step-wise process based on geographic information systems and species distribution models, in combination with factors such as distribution, density, and predation, create a useful tool that allows the extent of impacts of invasive species to be assessed across large spatial scales. These models will be useful for conservation managers as they provide easy visual interpretation of results, and can help prioritise where direct conservation action or control of the invader are required...|$|R
