50|$|QuayLink is a {{bus service}} in Tyne and Wear, England, {{connecting}} the city centres of Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead with the Quayside area. Conceived as a high-quality environmentally friendly operation, it {{was launched in}} 2005 as routes Q1 and Q2 using <b>diesel</b> <b>turbine</b> hybrid electric buses (Designline Olymbus) operated by Stagecoach North East under contract to the local authorities, who funded {{the purchase of the}} buses and other improvements. After problems with the hybrid buses coping with the hilly terrain, when put out to re-tender in 2010 new buses were specified, and the contract transferred to Go North East using eco-friendly diesel buses (Optare Versa Euro V EEV). Following budget cuts, in 2015 the service was operated by Go North East on a commercial basis, reaching further into the suburbs as a renumbered Q1/Q2/Q3 route network. From 31 July 2016 Q3 was extended to run to Wallsend Metro.|$|E

50|$|Gas {{and steam}} {{turbines}} are most efficient at thousands of revolutions per minute. This {{is a major}} drawback {{because of the need}} for heavy gears, which drive the engine into one single duty, propulsion. Electric motors provide numerous applications including use of accessories besides that of propulsion. Permanent magnets and even motor generator sets will soon be included into Naval fleets that will have a larger variety of applications. Along with increased application usage, Naval fleets will produce less exhaust than leading <b>diesel</b> <b>turbines,</b> which will lead to a cleaner and more efficient vehicle.|$|R
30|$|Cavitation erosion (CE), {{which is}} the {{predominant}} cause {{for the failure of}} overflow components, can be frequently observed in fluid machinery such as ship propellers and rudder blades, the cylinder liners of marine <b>diesel,</b> <b>turbine</b> impellers and various pumps. Corrosive ocean environment will accelerate the cavitation damage of the overflow parts of ships and drilling platforms. CE has become the central technical problems of the fluid equipment, which threatens the safety of the equipment, reduces the efficiency and increases the cost [1, 2]. Therefore, improving the CE resistance of the materials in fluid machinery has significant economic benefits.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to review issues related to the design of heat recovery unit in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems. To meet specific needs of CHP systems, configurations can be altered to affect different factors of the design.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to make a}} clean sheet of paper {{approach}} to develop a platform for a future frigate/destroyer size warship based on the operational requirements in the context of future crisis management and constrained resources. The envisioned timeframe {{is the beginning of the}} next decade, i. e. 2010 +. Basic operational requirements regarding the bare warship platform will be weighted and discussed. The study is concentrating on the hull and propulsion configuration to support the derived operational needs. All weapons and control systems will be handled as interchangeable modules, hence only spaces and interfaces will be discussed in this thesis. Special emphasis is given to Total Ownership Costs and the risk from incorporating not yet introduced technologies.
