50|$|Cyclopean stairs form as {{a result}} of glacial erosion. The term refers to the {{longitudinal}} profile of a <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley</b> that has several consecutive hanging valleys.|$|E
50|$|From {{south to}} north the Endicott Mountains present long, broad <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys</b> with rounded hills between {{rising in the}} center of the range to steep tors and aretes. The {{northern}} slopes of the Endicotts are steeper and more heavily incised, before they give way to the Arctic Coastal Plain.|$|R
50|$|The {{ranges of}} the Baffin Mountains are {{separated}} by deep fjords and <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys</b> with many spectacular glacial and ice-capped mountains. The snowfall in the Baffin Mountains is light, much less than {{in places like the}} Saint Elias Mountains in southeastern Alaska and southwestern Yukon which are plastered with snow.|$|R
40|$|Four glacial {{advances}} {{are preserved}} and exposed in the stratigraphy of the South Fork Hoh River valley. The oldest of these advances extended beyond the South Fork valley into the Hoh River valley. The three younger advances are {{preserved in the}} stratigraphy cut bank exposures in the valley and geomorphically by moraines and outwash plains. One of these advances represents a re-advance to the same terminal position of the previous advance and has not previously been recognized in this <b>valley</b> or other <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys</b> in the western Olympic Mountains. This finding advocates for a detailed sedimentologic and stratigraphic approach to glacial deposits and questions whether a similar advance is seen in other <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys</b> of the region. If so, this may reveal information regarding climate influences on glacial advance not previously considered for this specific time period...|$|R
50|$|Situated in the {{northeast}} is Haslingden Grane, a <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley</b> with three reservoirs, Calf Hey, Ogden and Holden Wood. There is a car park and information centre at Clough Head.|$|E
50|$|The {{property}} covers about 166 acre, and {{consists of}} a <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley</b> with a stream running {{the length of the}} property from North to South. Other habitats include woodland and Heath (habitat).|$|E
50|$|Coniston Water is {{an example}} of a ribbon lake formed by glaciation. The lake sits in a deep U-shaped <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley</b> scoured by a glacier in the {{surrounding}} volcanic and limestone rocks during the last ice age.|$|E
50|$|A riegel (from German, {{literally}} crossbar) is a transverse {{ridge of}} bedrock {{that has been}} exposed by glacial erosion. Riegels are also known as rock bars, thresholds, and verrous. They are found in <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys,</b> and are often associated with waterfalls and zones of rapids when streams are present. When multiple riegels are stacked in a series they {{are referred to as}} a glacial stairway.|$|R
50|$|The Penny Ice Cap is a 6000 km2 ice cap in Auyuittuq National Park of Baffin Island, Nunavut, Canada. It forms a 2000 m high barrier on the Cumberland Peninsula, {{an area of}} deep fiords and <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys.</b> It is {{a remnant}} of the last ice age. During the mid-1990s, Canadian {{researchers}} studied the glacier's patterns of freezing and thawing over centuries by drilling ice core samples.|$|R
5000|$|Greenan (...) is {{a village}} in County Wicklow, Ireland. Nearby are the towns of Rathdrum and Aughrim along with the <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys</b> of Glendalough and Glenmalure. The name is spelled 'Greenane' on older signs in the village (see thumbnail); the modern version drops the final 'e'. Greenan is also {{the name of a}} {{crossing}} in County Monaghan, Ireland. Its coordinates are 54° 11' 33" [...] North, 7° 4' 37" [...] West.|$|R
50|$|This part of Glen Lui {{is a broad}} <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley</b> {{dotted with}} moraines - {{the remains of the}} ancient glacial past. Other remains - seen as grassy, roughly {{rectangular}} outlines - are those of the townships and farms.|$|E
5000|$|Tal-y-llyn Lake, {{also known}} as Talyllyn Lake, Llyn Mwyngil or Llyn Myngul is a large glacial ribbon lake in Gwynedd, North Wales. It is formed by a post-glacial massive {{landslip}} damming up the lake within the <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Dwarfie Stane is a megalithic {{chambered}} tomb {{carved out}} of a titanic block of Devonian Old Red Sandstone located in a steep-sided <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley</b> between the settlements of Quoys and Rackwick on Hoy, an island in Orkney, Scotland. The stone is a glacial erratic located in desolate peatland.|$|E
50|$|Île de la Possession lies in {{the eastern}} group of the archipelago, about 20 km west of Île de l'Est (East Island). It has a rugged, {{landscape}} of mountains cut by deep <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys.</b> The coastal areas and valleys are covered with herbaceous subantarctic vegetation. The island is uninhabited except for {{the staff of the}} Alfred Faure research station at the eastern end of the island, with a maximum of about 20 people.|$|R
50|$|U-shaped valleys, trough valleys or glacial troughs, {{are formed}} {{by the process of}} glaciation. They are {{characteristic}} of mountain glaciation in particular. They have a characteristic U shape, with steep, straight sides and a flat bottom. <b>Glaciated</b> <b>valleys</b> are formed when a glacier travels across and down a slope, carving the valley by the action of scouring. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice, called glacial till or glacial erratic.|$|R
5000|$|A fjard (fjärd, [...] ) is an inlet {{formed by}} the marine {{submergence}} of formerly <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys</b> and depressions within a rocky glaciated terrain of low relief. Fjards are characterized by a profile that is shorter, shallower, and broader than {{the profile of a}} fjord. A fjard lacks the steep walls that characterize a glacial trough that has been partially submerged to form a fjord. Examples of fjards are Bråviken on the coast of Sweden, Hjortsholm on the coast of Denmark, and Somes Sound in Acadia National Park, Maine.|$|R
50|$|Portage Lake is a glacial {{lake in the}} Chugach National Forest of Alaska. It sits in a long, heavily <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley,</b> and abuts the calving face of Portage Glacier at its {{southern}} end. The lake has only become visible since approximately 1914, with the rapid retreat of Portage Glacier.|$|E
50|$|St. Moritz {{lies on the}} {{southern}} slopes of the Albula Alps below the Piz Nair (3,056 m) overlooking the flat and wide <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley</b> of the Upper Engadine and eponymous lake: Lej da San Murezzan (Romansh for Lake of St. Moritz). It hosted the Winter Olympics in 1928 and 1948.|$|E
50|$|Skagway {{is located}} in a narrow <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley</b> {{at the head of the}} Taiya Inlet, the north end of the Lynn Canal, which is the most {{northern}} fjord on the Inside Passage on the south coast of Alaska. It is in the Alaska panhandle 90 miles northwest of Juneau, Alaska's capital city.|$|E
50|$|The Humboldts run roughly north-south for a {{distance}} of some 30 km, its eastern and western edges defined by the roughly parallel <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys</b> of the Hollyford and Dart Rivers. They are separated from the Ailsa Range to the south by the smaller valley of the Caples River. In the extreme southeast, the range drops straight to the waters of Lake Wakatipu, close to the small settlements of Kinloch and Glenorchy. Numerous small rivers have their sources within the Humboldts, notably the Routeburn River and the Olivine River. Two major tramping tracks follow valleys within the Humboldt Range, the Caples Track and the Routeburn Track.|$|R
25|$|Among the {{features}} {{left behind by}} the ice are the <b>glaciated</b> U-shaped <b>valleys</b> of the Lake District and erratics (blocks of rock) that have been transported from the Oslo region of Norway and deposited on the coast of Yorkshire.|$|R
50|$|The Polychrome Glaciers {{are five}} glaciers in the Alaska Range of Denali National Park and Preserve in the U.S. state of Alaska. The glaciers {{originate}} in parallel <b>glaciated</b> north-trending <b>valleys</b> in the Alaska Range, opposite Polychrome Mountain across Polychrome Pass.|$|R
50|$|Isaac Palmer {{founded the}} village of Lodi in 1846 {{in what was then}} the Pleasant Valley Precinct of the Wisconsin Territory. He named it after Lodi, in Italy. Palmer chose this <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley</b> as the {{location}} for the village because of its water power potential. Spring Creek powered a sawmill that year and a grist mill followed in 1850.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the last}} Ice age, the River Twymyn did not {{flow through the}} valley. When the valley was filled by a glacier, the ice ground out a U-shaped <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley.</b> When the glacier that filled the valley melted the Twymyn started to run down the wide channel left behind and the fast flowing river further eroded the valley, cutting the V-shaped gorge as seen today.|$|E
50|$|The {{upper section}} of the river lies in a <b>glaciated</b> <b>valley,</b> with glacier {{scouring}} scars {{high up on the}} upper parts of the mountains of the West Coast Range. Also small glacial lakes occur on and north of Mount Sedgwick. Lake Beatrice for instance lies on the eastern slope of Mount Sedgwick. The upper portion of the King River valley was first surveyed for damming in 1917 by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company.|$|E
50|$|Larne sits on {{the western}} side of a narrow inlet that links Larne Lough to the sea. On {{the eastern side of the}} inlet is a {{peninsula}} called Islandmagee. To the west of Larne is the ancient volcanic formation of Antrim Plateau, with its <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys</b> scenically sweeping down to the sea to the north of Larne in what are known as the Glens of Antrim. Larne is 25 miles from the Scottish mainland, with stunning views across the North Channel towards the Mull of Kintyre, Rhins of Galloway, Islay and Paps of Jura often visible from the Larne area - this proximity to Scotland has had a defining influence on Larne's history and culture.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the history}} {{recorded}} by the Alaska Volcano Observatory: “The first episode began in Pliocene or early Pleistocene time (the oldest known age of lavas is 0.93 Ma 1990) and produced extensive flows and subordinate pyroclastic deposits of basaltic and andesitic composition, which enlarged the island by several kilometers along the northwest coast. Radial dips of flows suggest that Makushin Volcano itself was the principal vent area. The older flows are extensively glaciated, which implies a minimum age of late Pleistocene. The summit of Makushin subsequently collapsed, forming a caldera. Andesitic pyroclastic-flow and debris flow deposits occur in <b>glaciated</b> <b>valleys</b> on {{the north and south}} sides of the volcano indicating a Holocene age for the caldera-forming eruption." ...|$|R
50|$|Indian Chimney Falls is a 60-foot (18.2 m) {{waterfall}} in Lansing, New York. It {{is named}} after a nearby shale formation formed by a creek. The creek with its waterfall are a hanging valley entering as a tributary to the <b>glaciated</b> main <b>valley</b> of Cayuga Lake.|$|R
