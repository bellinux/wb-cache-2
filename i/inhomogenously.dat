40|$|Abstract—We {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{studied the}} dispersion effects in an actively mode-locked inhomogeneously broadened laser. In the positive group velocity dispersion (GVD) re-gion, the laser generates incoherent pulses. Self-phase modulation and resonant dispersion impede {{reduction of the}} pulse duration when the GVD is small or near zero. A single, stable, soliton-like pulse can be generated only when the GVD is within a certain range of negative values. When the negative GVD is too small, the laser generates only multiple soliton-like pulses because of excess gain filtering. When the negative GVD is too large, the soliton pulse-shaping process fails, and the laser generates only incoherent pulses due to insufficient gain filtering. In the experiment, we char-acterized an actively mode-locked inhomogeneously broadened Nd: silicate glass laser and confirmed this GVD dependence. The laser generated self-sustaining, soliton-like pulses as short as 77 fs. Index Terms—Dispersion, <b>inhomogenously</b> broadened lasers, mode-locked lasers, Nd:glass laser, soliton. I...|$|E
40|$|Unwanted {{interaction}} between a quantum {{system and its}} fluctuating environment leads to decoherence and is the primary obstacle to establishing a scalable quantum information processing architecture. Strategies such as environmental and materials engineering, quantum error correction and dynamical decoupling can mitigate decoherence, but generally increase experimental complexity.

Using a rapidly converging Bayesian approach, we precisely measure the splitting in a singlet-triplet spin qubit faster than the surrounding nuclear bath fluctuates. We continuously adjust qubit control parameters based on this information, thereby improving the <b>inhomogenously</b> broadened coherence time (T_ 2 ^*) from tens of nanoseconds to above 2 μs and demonstrating the effectiveness of Hamiltonian estimation in reducing the effects of correlated noise in quantum systems.

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} exciton dynamics in a conjugated polymer is studied using time-resolved spectroscopy. Photoluminescence decays were measured in heterostructured samples containing a sharp polymer-fullerene interface, which acts as an exciton quenching wall. Using a 1 D diffusion model, the exciton diffusion length and diffusion coefficient were extracted in the temperature range of 4 - 293 K. The exciton dynamics reveal two temperature regimes: {{in the range of}} 4 - 150 K, the exciton diffusion length (coefficient) of ~ 3 nm (~ 1. 5 × 10 - 4 cm 2 /s) is nearly temperature independent. Increasing the temperature up to 293 K leads to a gradual growth up to 4. 5 nm (~ 3. 2 × 10 - 4 cm 2 /s). This demonstrates that exciton diffusion in conjugated polymers is governed by two processes: an initial downhill migration toward lower energy states in the <b>inhomogenously</b> broadened density of states, followed by temperature activated hopping. The latter process is switched off below 150 K. ...|$|E

We found that using a titled spin polarizer layer decreases the droplet nucleation time which is more suitable for high speed applications. However, tilted polarizer increases the nucleation current and decreases the frequency stability of the droplet. A perpendicular polarizer represents a more reversed magnetization at the spatial profile of the droplet than that the tilted polarizer. Additionally, by driving the magnetization <b>inhomogenously</b> in the nano-contact region, it is found that tilted polarizer reduces the precession angle and through an interplay with the Oersted field of the DC current, it breaks the spatial symmetry of the droplet profile.

40|$|New {{results are}} {{reported}} on investigation of dispersion curves for surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at an <b>inhomogenously</b> doped semiconductor/dielectric interface whereby the dielectric {{is represented by}} the same undoped semiconductor. The doped semiconductor is described by its frequency-dependent permittivity that varies with the depth. It is shown that a transition layer (TL) with a linear change in carrier concentration supports one branch dispersion curve regardless of the TL thickness. The obtained dispersion curves reach a maximum at a finite frequency depending on the TL thickness, and subsequently asymptotically approach the zero frequency in the shortwave limit. Therefore two surface plasmon modes are supported at a given frequency: a long-wave mode with a positive group velocity and a short-wave mode with a negative group velocity. A condition of a zero group velocity can be satisfied by tuning the TL layer. It is shown that the conventional dispersion relation for SPPs at a TL with a zero thickness is an asymptotic solution, and the convergence of real dispersion curves is point-wise instead of an expected uniform convergence.

40|$|Monolayer {{photonic}} materials offer {{a tremendous}} potential for on-chip optoelectronic devices. Their realization requires knowledge of optical coherence properties of excitons and trions that {{have so far}} been limited to nonlinear optical experiments carried out with strongly <b>inhomogenously</b> broadened material. Here we employ h-BN encapsulated and electrically gated MoSe 2 to reveal coherence properties of trion-species directly in the linear optical response. Autocorrelation measurements reveal long dephasing times up to T 2 = 1. 16 +- 0. 05 ps for positively charged excitons. Gate dependent measurements provide evidence that the positively-charged trion forms via spatially localized hole states making this trion less prone to dephasing {{in the presence of}} elevated hole carrier concentrations. Quantum beat signatures demonstrate coherent coupling between excitons and trions that have a dephasing time up to 0. 6 ps, a two-fold increase over those in previous reports. A key merit of the prolonged exciton/trion coherences is that they were achieved in a linear optical experiment, and thus are directly relevant to applications in nanolasers, coherent control, and on-chip quantum information processing requiring long photon coherence.

In this manuscript, we first show experimentally that the nuclear steady state polarization reached in solutions of pyruvic acid with 15 mM trityl radicals is substantially independent from the average internuclear distance. This evidences a leading role of electron (over nuclear) spin relaxation processes in determining the ultimate performances of DNP.

Thanks to this additional term, the dependence of the nuclear polarization on the electron concentration can be properly accounted for.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: To {{characterize}} a {{new approach}} to magnetization transfer (MT) imaging with improved specificity for myelinated tissues relative to conventional MT. METHODS: Magnetization transfer preparation sequences were implemented with all radiofrequency power centered on a single frequency and also with power evenly divided between positive and negative frequencies. Dual frequency saturation was achieved both with short, alternating frequency pulses and with sinusoidal modulation of continuous irradiation. Images following preparation were acquired with a single shot fast spin echo sequence. Single and dual frequency preparation should achieve similar saturation of molecules except for those with <b>inhomogenously</b> broadened lines. Inhomogenous MT (IHMT) images were generated by subtraction of dual from single frequency prepared images. IHMT imaging was performed with different power and frequency in the brains of normal volunteers. RESULTS: The IHMT method demonstrated a greater white/gray matter ratio than conventional MT and virtual elimination of signal in scalp and other unmyelinated tissues. IHMT exceeded 5 % of the fully relaxed magnetization in white matter. A broad frequency spectrum and signs of axonal angular dependence at high frequency were observed that are consistent with dipolar broadening. CONCLUSION: IHMT shows promise for myelin-specific imaging. Further study of physical mechanisms and diagnostic sensitivity are merited.

In vitro experiments revealed that human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) adhere <b>inhomogenously</b> on untreated PEEK films, but the plasma treatment with oxygen or ammonia allows the hMSC to adhere and proliferate. Fluorescence microscopy of the cells on the PEEK films turned out to be difficult because of the strong auto-fluorescence of the PEEK substrate. Stains including the whole cell vital stain Calcein-AM allowed cell morphology studies on plasma-treated PEEK films. In the case of the analysis of cell compartments such as the actin cytoskeleton, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was successfully applie...|$|E
40|$|The case A nine {{year old}} boy, born of third degree consanguinity, {{presented}} with a hard left scapular swelling for 6 months. There was no history of fever, trauma or weight loss. There was no pain, redness or discharge. This mass was excised but recurred over the next 6 months (Left panel of Figure 1). A similar swelling had been excised from the left knee one year before presentation, but had recurred over 6 months. Family history was negative for similar lesions. Development was normal for age {{and he had no}} other medical problems. On examination, pulse was 84 per minute, blood pressure 96 / 68 mmHg, weight 22 kg and height 122 cm (both between 10 th and 25 th percentile). A 6 × 4 cm mass was noted in the right scapular region and a 3 × 3 cm mass at the lateral aspect of the left knee. Both of these masses were firm to hard, globular, nontender, and fixed to the bone. The overlying skin was without erythema or local warmth, though scars from the previous resections were noted. Lymphadenopathy was absent. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Radiographs of the knee showed a lobular, <b>inhomogenously</b> but densely calcified lesion in the anterolateral region of the left knee (Right panel of Figure 1). Serum calcium was 9. ...|$|E
