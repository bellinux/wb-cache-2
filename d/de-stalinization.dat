5|$|For {{a decade}} after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or {{condemned}} by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar Second Polish Republic. This began to change, however, particularly after <b>de-Stalinization</b> and the Polish October (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.|$|E
5|$|Gomułka's thaw {{was caused}} by several factors. The death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 and the {{resulting}} <b>de-Stalinization</b> and the Khrushchev Thaw prompted debates about fundamental issues throughout the entire Eastern Bloc. Nikita Khrushchev's speech, On the Personality Cult and its Consequences, had wide implications for the Soviet Union and other Communist countries as well.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev became the Soviet leader {{following}} the deposition and execution of Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes. As part of a campaign of <b>de-Stalinization,</b> he declared {{that the only way}} to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} <b>de-Stalinization</b> in Czechoslovakia had begun under Antonín Novotný {{in the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the Eastern Bloc. Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the {{completion}} of socialism, and the new constitution, accordingly, adopted the name Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The pace of change, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalinist-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trials, may have been considered as early as 1963, but {{did not take place}} until 1967.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{became an}} early convert to the Bolshevik cause. He {{was a strong}} {{supporter}} of Stalin during the immediate post-Lenin years. During Stalin's rule, Mikoyan held several high governmental posts, including that of Minister of Foreign Trade. By the end of Stalin's rule, Mikoyan began to lose favour with him, and in 1949, Mikoyan lost his long-standing post of minister of foreign trade. In October 1952 at the 19th Party Congress Stalin even attacked Mikoyan viciously. When Stalin died in 1953, Mikoyan again took a leading role in policy-making. He backed Khrushchev and his <b>de-Stalinization</b> policy, and became First Deputy Premier under Khrushchev. Mikoyan's position under Khrushchev made him the second most powerful figure in the Soviet Union at the time.|$|E
5|$|Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev (15 April 1894 – 11 September 1971) was a Soviet statesman {{who led the}} Soviet Union during part of the Cold War as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964, and as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, or Premier, from 1958 to 1964. Khrushchev was {{responsible}} for the <b>de-Stalinization</b> of the Soviet Union, for backing the progress of the early Soviet space program, and for several relatively liberal reforms in areas of domestic policy. Khrushchev's party colleagues removed him from power in 1964, replacing him with Leonid Brezhnev as First Secretary and Alexei Kosygin as Premier.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Brezhnev {{years and}} the lengthy interregnum that followed, the {{generation}} which had come of age during the 'first Russian spring' of the 1950s awaited its turn in power. As Brezhnev and his colleagues died or were pensioned off, they were replaced {{by men and women}} for whom the Secret Speech and the first wave of <b>de-Stalinization</b> had been a formative experience, and these 'Children of Twentieth Congress' took up the reins of power under the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev and his colleagues. The Khrushchev era provided this second generation of reformers with both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries {{of the security}} forces were brought to court in the process of <b>de-Stalinization.</b> According to Heather Laskey, it was not a coincidence that the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization {{of the security forces}} as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents of the security forces.|$|E
5|$|In February 1956 Khrushchev denounced Stalin's cult of {{personality}} at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party and {{embarked on a}} reform course. The <b>de-Stalinization</b> of official Soviet ideology left Poland's Stalinist hardliners in a difficult position. While unrest and desire for reform and change among both intellectuals and workers was beginning to surface throughout the Eastern Bloc, the death of Stalin's ally Bierut in March 1956 in Moscow (the veteran hardliner chief was attending the Soviet party's congress) exacerbated an existing split in the Polish party. In March Bierut was succeeded by Edward Ochab as first secretary. As the 20th Congress launched also a process of partial democratisation of Polish political and economic life, Ochab engaged in reforms intended to promote industrial decentralization and improve living standards.|$|E
25|$|On March 9, 1956, about {{a hundred}} Georgian {{students}} were killed when they demonstrated against Nikita Khrushchev's policy of <b>de-Stalinization</b> that was accompanied by general criticism of the whole Georgian people and culture.|$|E
25|$|Stalin's {{successful}} {{appeal for}} patriotic unity eclipsed Georgian nationalism {{during the war}} and diffused it in the years following. On March 9, 1956, about a hundred Georgian students were killed when they demonstrated against Nikita Khrushchev's policy of <b>de-Stalinization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{surviving}} 1939 pavilions are {{the last}} and only example of Stalin's monumental propaganda in their original setting. Such propaganda pieces were not built to last (like Shchusev's War Trophy Hangar in Gorky Park); some were demolished during the <b>de-Stalinization</b> of 1956.|$|E
25|$|Romania {{had not had}} any <b>de-Stalinization.</b> Following {{growing public}} protests, {{president}} Nicolae Ceaușescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest. But mass protests against Ceauşescu proceeded. The Romanian military sided with protesters and turned on Ceauşescu. They executed him after a brief trial three days later.|$|E
25|$|When Kun was {{politically}} rehabilitated in 1956, {{as part of}} the <b>de-Stalinization</b> process, the Soviet party told its Hungarian counterpart that Kun had died in prison on 30 November 1939. In 1989, the Soviet government announced that Kun had actually been executed in the Gulag more than a year earlier than that, on 29 August 1938.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1954, {{work on the}} Canal and other labor camps was halted, and beatings in prison outlawed. The Securitate was again on the alert just two years later, when <b>de-Stalinization</b> was officially {{introduced}} by the Soviet Union. When Romanian intellectuals first heard rumors about Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech, and began questioning Romania's own Stalinism, Drăghici extended secret police surveillance to the academic field.|$|E
25|$|Stalin died on 5 March 1953. Without a {{mutually}} agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted {{to rule the}} Soviet Union jointly through a troika. This did not last, however, and Nikita Khrushchev eventually won the power struggle by the mid-1950s. He shortly afterward denounced Stalin's use of repression in 1956 and proceeded to ease Stalin's repressive controls over party and society. This was known as <b>de-Stalinization.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{negative}} experiences in Moscow, Bettelheim retained a favorable attitude towards Soviet socialism until the Sixties, citing the economic {{accomplishments of the}} Soviet Union, which he appreciated from an independent point of view. In 1956, he endorsed the <b>De-Stalinization</b> inaugurated by Nikita Khrushchev at the Twentieth Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, {{as well as the}} reforms conceived by Soviet economist Evsei Liberman, suggesting a decentralization of decisions made within the planning leadership.|$|E
25|$|The Sino-Soviet rift and the {{obsession}} with Khrushchev's revisionism looms {{large in the}} coming of the Cultural Revolution, as Mao saw revisionism and <b>de-Stalinization</b> as a threat not only to his own position but also to the very survival of the Chinese Communist Party as a revolutionary force. Accordingly, an appreciation of Kang's role as a supporter of Mao's line in this period helps explain his return to very near the pinnacle of power a few years later.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other Eastern Bloc countries, the Socialist Republic of Romania {{had never}} {{undergone}} even limited <b>de-Stalinization.</b> In November 1989, Ceauşescu, then aged 71, was re-elected {{for another five}} years {{as leader of the}} Romanian Communist Party, signaling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Eastern Europe. As Ceauşescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, on December 16, 1989, his Securitate ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian-speaking Calvinist minister, László Tőkés, for sermons offending the regime.|$|E
25|$|In March 1956, {{after the}} 20th Soviet Party Congress in Moscow ushered in <b>de-Stalinization,</b> Edward Ochab {{was chosen to}} replace the {{deceased}} Bolesław Bierut as first secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party. As a result, Poland was rapidly overtaken by social restlessness and reformist undertakings; thousands of political prisoners were released and many people previously persecuted were officially rehabilitated. Worker riots in Poznań in June 1956 were violently suppressed, but they {{gave rise to the}} formation of a reformist current within the communist party.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} Oil Rocks, Azerbaijan's first {{offshore}} oil field was {{opened in the}} early 1950s. Policies of <b>de-Stalinization</b> and improvement after the 1950s led to better education and welfare conditions for most of Azerbaijan. This also coincided with the period of rapid urbanization and industrialization. During this period of change, a new anti-Islamic drive and return to a policy of Russification, under the policy of sblizheniye (rapprochement), was instituted in order to merge all {{the peoples of the}} USSR into a new monolithic Soviet nation.|$|E
25|$|After Stalin's {{death and}} {{a short period of}} {{collective}} rule, the new leader Nikita Khrushchev denounced the cult of personality of Stalin and launched the policy of <b>de-Stalinization.</b> The penal labor system was reformed and many prisoners were released and rehabilitated (many of them posthumously). The general easement of repressive policies became known later as the Khrushchev Thaw. At the same time, tensions with the United States heightened when the two rivals clashed over the deployment of the United States Jupiter missiles in Turkey and Soviet missiles in Cuba.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, he {{was among}} the Party leaders who spoke out against Iosif Chişinevschi and other former leaders who had been since marginalized, such as Pauker (whom he accused of having {{maintained}} contacts with Soviet police chief Lavrentiy Beria), Boris Stefanov, and Lucreţiu Pătrăşcanu. He also rallied with Gheorghiu-Dej's positive views on <b>de-Stalinization,</b> claiming that Pauker's fall had been a sign of Romania parting with Stalinism. At the time, he argued that Pauker and her collaborator Vasile Luca had viewed him with suspicion based on his participation in the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
25|$|In this context, the PMR soon {{dismissed}} all {{the relevant}} consequences of the Twentieth Soviet Congress, and Gheorghiu-Dej even argued that <b>De-Stalinization</b> had been imposed by his team right after 1952. At a party meeting in March 1956, {{two members of the}} Politburo who were supporters of Khruschevite reforms, Miron Constantinescu and Iosif Chişinevschi, criticized Gheorghiu-Dej's leadership and identified him with Romanian Stalinism. They were purged in 1957, themselves accused of being Stalinists and of having been plotting with Pauker. Through Ceaușescu's voice, Gheorghiu-Dej also marginalized another group of old members of the PMR, associated with Constantin Doncea (June 1958).|$|E
25|$|The Central Committee Plenum in January 1987 saw the {{crystallisation}} of Gorbachev's political reforms, including {{proposals for}} multi-candidate {{elections and the}} appointment of non-Party members to government positions. He also first raised the idea of expanding co-operatives. Economic reforms took up {{much of the rest}} of 1987, as a new law giving enterprises more independence was passed in June and Gorbachev released a book, Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World, in November, elucidating his main ideas for reform. In 1987, he rehabilitated many opponents of Joseph Stalin—another part of the <b>De-Stalinization,</b> which began in 1956, when Lenin's Testament was published.|$|E
25|$|The March 1956 demonstrations (also {{known as}} the 1956 Tbilisi riots or 9 March massacre) in the Georgian SSR were a series of protests against Nikita Khrushchev's <b>de-Stalinization</b> policy, which shocked Georgian {{supporters}} of Marxist–Leninist–Stalinist ideology. The center of the protests was the republic's capital, Tbilisi, where spontaneous rallies to mark the third anniversary of Stalin's death and to protest Khrushchev's denunciation of Stalin quickly evolved into an uncontrollable mass demonstration and rioting which paralyzed the city. Soon, political demands such as the change {{of the central government}} in Moscow and calls for the independence of Georgia from the Soviet Union appeared.|$|E
25|$|Both Gheorghiu-Dej and Drăghici opposed <b>de-Stalinization,</b> {{but their}} talk of {{national}} communism and socialist patriotism signaled Romania's emancipation from the Soviet Union. Drăghici still had important assignments after Gheorghiu-Dej's death, but was bitterly opposed to emerging communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu used his {{influence in the}} party to incriminate Drăghici of all publicly known Securitate crimes, then deposed him. Drăghici was not brought to justice, but lived in anonymity in the Bucharest area from 1968 to 1989. He lived his final years in Hungary, with his family, despite Romanian efforts to have him extradited. Shortly before his death, a trial held in absentia convicted him of incitement to murder.|$|E
25|$|The Cold War emerged by 1947, as the Eastern Bloc, united {{under the}} Warsaw Pact in 1955, confronted the Western Bloc, united under NATO in 1949. On 5 March 1953, Stalin died and was quickly succeeded by Nikita Khrushchev, who in 1956 denounced Stalin {{and began the}} <b>De-Stalinization</b> of Soviet society through the Khrushchev Thaw. The Soviet Union took an early lead in the Space Race, with the first {{artificial}} satellite and the first human spaceflight. Khrushchev was removed from power by his colleagues in 1964 and was succeeded as head of state by Leonid Brezhnev. In the 1970s, {{there was a brief}} détente of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed with the Soviet–Afghan War in 1979. In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to reform and liberalize the economy through his policies of glasnost and perestroika. Under Gorbachev, the role of the Communist Party in governing the state was removed from the constitution, causing a surge of severe political instability to set in. The Cold War ended during his tenure, and in 1989, Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe overthrew their respective communist governments.|$|E
25|$|After Stalin's {{death in}} 1953, {{many cases of}} the Soviet {{political}} prisoners were re-examined by the Soviet authorities during the <b>de-Stalinization</b> campaign and Poška was {{allowed to return to}} Lithuania in 1959. After his return home Poška worked as a lecturer, a correspondent of several newspapers, {{and the chairman of the}} reestablished Vilnius Esperantist Club in 1964–69. As a former political prisoner, he remained suspect to Soviet authorities and was not allowed to continue academic activities or publish his books until the Perestroika reforms in 1985. Poška continued to travel. For example, in 1960, together with biologist Tadas Ivanauskas, he visited the Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve in Tajikistan and later hitchhiked to Leningrad and Moldova. In summer 1972, at age 70, he went on the last large journey. It was a five-week motorbike ride to the Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains, via the Georgian Military Road to Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Sukhumi on the Black sea. The last decade of his life Poška spent under the piles of his rescued archive, trying and failing to publish it. His major work, the eight-volume book on his journey to India From the Baltic Sea to the Bay of Bengal, was published by his supporters already after his death.|$|E
500|$|Lem became truly {{productive}} after 1956, {{when the}} <b>de-Stalinization</b> {{period in the}} Soviet Union led to the [...] "Polish October", when Poland experienced an increase in freedom of speech. Between 1956 and 1968, Lem authored seventeen books. His writing {{over the next three}} decades or so was split between science fiction (primarily prose) and essays about science and culture.|$|E
500|$|In 1957 Mikoyan {{refused to}} back {{an attempt by}} Malenkov and Molotov to remove Khrushchev from power; he thus secured his {{position}} as one of Khrushchev's closest allies. He backed Khrushchev because of his strong support for <b>de-Stalinization</b> and his belief that a triumph by the plotters might {{have given way to}} purges similar to the ones in the 1930s. In recognition of his support and his economic talents, Khrushchev appointed Mikoyan First Deputy Premier and liked to playfully describe him as [...] "My rug merchant." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the death}} of Stalin, the Soviet Union went {{through a process of}} moving away from Stalinist {{policies}} known as <b>de-Stalinization.</b> The purpose of <b>de-Stalinization</b> included not only ending the use of terror and the Gulag system that had existed under Stalin, but also reforming the economic policies of the Soviet Union. In the 1950s, the Soviet economy had begun to fall behind schedule in the output of several key materials including coal, iron and cement, and worker productivity was not growing at the rate expected. In May 1955, Pravda (the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Communist Party) announced that a State Committee on Labour and Wages had been formed to investigate changes to wages and a centralised system of wage adjustments. In July 1955, Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin spoke of the need for Soviet industry to end outdated work quotas and reform wages, so that the Soviet Union could better incentivise workers and reduce labour turnover. The subsequent sixth Five-Year Plan for 1956 to 1960 included calls for a reform of wages. [...] The reforms had several objectives, the most important of which was to create a more consistent system of incentives for workers. It was also hoped that the reforms would help to reduce the levels of waste and misallocation of labour that were frequently found in Soviet industry.|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, a {{line from}} the lyrics used during Stalin's rule reappeared at the Moscow Metro station Kurskaya-Koltsevaya: [...] "We were raised by Stalin to be true to the people, inspiring us to feats of labour and heroism." [...] While groups have {{threatened}} legal action to reverse the re-addition of this phrase on a stone banner at the vestibule's rotunda, {{it was part of the}} original design of Kurskaya station and had been removed during <b>de-Stalinization.</b> Most of the commentary surrounding this event focused on the Kremlin's attempt to [...] "rehabilitate the image" [...] of Stalin by using symbolism sympathetic to or created by him.|$|E
500|$|Relations {{between the}} two nations began to cool in 1956, with Mao angered both by the Secret Speech and {{by the fact that the}} Chinese had not been {{consulted}} in advance about it. Mao believed that <b>de-Stalinization</b> was a mistake, and a possible threat to his own authority. When Khrushchev visited Beijing in 1958, Mao refused proposals for military cooperation. Hoping to torpedo Khrushchev's efforts at détente with the U.S., Mao soon thereafter provoked the Second Taiwan Strait Crisis, describing the Taiwanese islands shelled in the crisis as [...] "batons that keep Eisenhower and Khrushchev dancing, scurrying this way and that. Don't you see how wonderful they are?" ...|$|E
500|$|A wave of Armenian {{nationalism}} {{started in}} the mid-1960s in the Soviet Union after Nikita Khrushchev came to power and granted relative freedom to the Soviet people during the <b>De-Stalinization</b> era. On 24 April 1965, the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, a mass demonstration took place in Yerevan. Thousands of Armenians poured into the streets of Yerevan to commemorate {{the victims of the}} genocide; however, their goal was not to [...] "challenge the authority of the Soviet government", but [...] "draw the government's attention" [...] to the genocide and persuade the [...] "Soviet government to assist them in reclaiming their lost lands." [...] The Kremlin, taking into account the demands of the demonstrators, commissioned a memorial for the genocide. The memorial, which was built on Tsitsernakaberd hill, was completed in 1967.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet–Albanian split {{refers to}} the {{worsening}} of relations between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, which occurred in the 19551961 period {{as a result of}} Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev's rapprochement with Yugoslavia along with his [...] "Secret Speech" [...] and subsequent <b>de-Stalinization</b> policies, including efforts to extend these policies into Albania as was occurring in other Eastern Bloc states at the time. The Albanian leadership under Enver Hoxha perceived Khrushchev's policies as contrary to Marxist–Leninist doctrine and his denunciation of Joseph Stalin as an opportunistic act meant to legitimize revisionism within the international communist movement. Occurring {{within the context of the}} larger split between China and the USSR, the Soviet–Albanian split culminated in the rupturing of relations in 1961.|$|E
