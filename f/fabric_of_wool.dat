In order to improve the dyeing behavior <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics,</b> surface modification <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> <b>fabrics</b> was carried out using an atmospheric pressure (argon) low temperature plasma treatment (LTP).

There were four blend ratios of cashmere (0, 25, 50, 75 %) plus 100 % cashmere. Each {{of the nine}} fibre blend combinations were replicated three times, and each was knitted into three tightness factors. The 81 fabrics were evaluated using the Wool HandleMeter, which measures seven primary handle attributes and Overall handle, and have been calibrated using {{a panel of experts}} and a wide variety <b>of</b> commercial <b>fabrics.</b> Results were analysed by ANOVA and general linear modelling.

Lower-class people, such as slaves (theowas) and poorer peasants (geburas), could only use wool for their garments, even for those worn against the skin. Linen, harvested from the flax plant, was a finer material which was used for garments that were worn close to the skin by better-off peasants (kotsetlas and geneatas) and those above them in the social hierarchy. Silk was an extremely expensive material and was used only by the very rich, and then only for trim and decoration.|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the relationships between the}} sensations of sweaty, damp, muggy and clingy, as assessed by human response from wearer trial garment assessment, and fiber type, fiber, yarn and fabric properties and instrumental <b>fabric</b> measurements <b>of</b> next-to-skin knitwear. Wearer trial assessment <b>of</b> 48 <b>fabrics</b> followed a strict 60 minute protocol including a range of environmental conditions and levels of exercise. Adjusted mean weighted scores were determined using linked garments. Instrumental fabric handle measurements were determined with the Wool HandleMeter (WHM) and Wool ComfortMeter. Data were analyzed using forward stepwise general linear modeling. Mean fiber diameter (MFD) affected the sweaty, damp, muggy and clingy sensation responses accounting for between 23. 5 % and 56. 2 % of the variance of these sensations. In all cases, finer fibers were associated with lower sensation scores (preferred). There were also effects of fiber type upon sweaty, muggy and clingy scores, with polyester fiber fabrics having higher scores (less preferred) compared with <b>fabrics</b> composed <b>of</b> <b>wool,</b> particularly for peak sweaty scores in hot and active environments. Attributes such as fabric density, yarn linear density, knitting structure and finishing treatments, but not fabric thickness, accounted for some further variance in these attributes once MFD had been taken into account. This is explained as finer fibers have a greater surface area for any given mass of fiber and so finer fibers can act as a more effective sink for moisture compared with coarser fibers. No fabric handle parameter or other attribute of fiber diameter distribution was significant in affecting these sensation scores...|$|R
