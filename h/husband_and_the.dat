5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and when Peter and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E

5|$|Her myths emphasise her bad {{temper and}} unhappiness, due to {{rejection}} {{by her father}} Shiva and her <b>husband,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hatred of her stepmother, Chandi (Shiva's wife, identified with Parvati in this context). In the Puranas, sage Kashyapa {{is considered to be}} her father, and not Shiva, although Lord Shiva is a father figure to her. Manasa is depicted as kind to her devotees, but harsh to people who refused to worship her. Denied full godhead by her mixed parentage, Manasa's aim was to fully establish her authority as a goddess and to acquire steadfast human devotees.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} to follow, public revelations {{on the state of}} Charles and Diana's {{marriage}} continued. Even though support for republicanism in Britain seemed higher {{than at any time in}} living memory, republicanism was still a minority viewpoint, and the Queen herself had high approval ratings. Criticism was focused on the institution of the monarchy itself and the Queen's wider family rather than her own behaviour and actions. In consultation with her <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister, John Major, as well as the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, and her private secretary, Robert Fellowes, she wrote to Charles and Diana at the end of December 1995, saying that a divorce was desirable.|$|E
5|$|The Tarakeswar affair (also {{known as}} the Tarakeswar scandal or the Mahant-Elokeshi affair) refers to a public scandal in 19th-century Bengal during the British Raj. It {{resulted}} from an illicit love affair between Elokeshi, {{the wife of a}} government employee Nobin Chandra, and the Brahmin head priest (or mahant) of the Tarakeswar Shiva temple. Nobin subsequently decapitated his wife Elokeshi because of the love affair. A highly publicised trial followed, dubbed the Tarakeswar murder case of 1873, in which both the <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mahant were found guilty in varying degrees.|$|E

5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected he would tell {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E
