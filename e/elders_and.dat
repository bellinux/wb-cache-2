5|$|The Zana-tompo (or Andriantompokoindrindra) {{were also}} {{considered}} <b>elders,</b> <b>and</b> Andriamasinavalona decreed that kings would henceforth select {{their wives and}} royal food tasters from among this caste. The rites pertaining to circumcision were another honor reserved for the Zana-tompo.

5|$|The {{county was}} further divided into districts, each {{consisting}} {{of at least}} several hamlets grouped together; typically a community of approximately one hundred families. A chief of police was assigned to each district by the county Magistrate. A county Magistrate heavily relied on the cooperation of local <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> leaders at the district level; these carried out much of the day-to-day affairs of arbitrating disputes in their communities, collecting taxes, and fighting crime.|$|E
5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting the consent of his <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the choice is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent of anyone else.|$|E

5|$|From the mid-1920s {{until his}} {{retirement}} in 1952, Crawford worked for the importers <b>Elders</b> <b>and</b> Fyffes. He played cricket and hockey for the firm until the Second World War, but kept a far lower profile than in his earlier cricketing life. He married his second wife, Hilda May Beman, in December 1925, but he never had children. He maintained a loose connection with cricket; he appeared at a birthday dinner for Pelham Warner, at a centenary celebration for the Free Foresters Cricket Club and in a radio broadcast for Jack Hobbs's 80th birthday. Crawford had a stroke in early 1962 and remained ill {{for the rest of the}} year; he died, aged 76, in a Surrey hospital on 2 May 1963.|$|E
5|$|In {{supporting}} Calvin's {{proposals for}} reforms, {{the council of}} Geneva passed the Ordonnances ecclésiastiques (Ecclesiastical Ordinances) on 20 November 1541. The ordinances defined four orders of ministerial function: pastors to preach and to administer the sacraments; doctors to instruct believers in the faith; elders to provide discipline; and deacons {{to care for the}} poor and needy. They also called for the creation of the Consistoire (Consistory), an ecclesiastical court composed of the lay <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> the ministers. The city government retained the power to summon persons before the court, and the Consistory could judge only ecclesiastical matters having no civil jurisdiction. Originally, the court had the power to mete out sentences, with excommunication as its most severe penalty. The government contested this power and on 19 March 1543 the council decided that all sentencing would be carried out by the government.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s {{a period of}} {{financial}} and leadership disputes occurred within the church hierarchy, with church treasurer, Stanley Rader, {{at the center of}} many of the disputes. The gravest incident was the church bwing placed in financial receivership by the Attorney General of California, George Deukmejian, an action that was later disallowed in court. Tkach took {{an active role in the}} defense of Armstrong, Rader, and the church headquarters' operations. He rallied the WCG membership to take action against the court proceedings. Armstrong recognized his effectiveness and subsequently ordained him to the rank of evangelist on September 27, 1979. See Evangelists of the Worldwide Church of God. In March 1981 Armstrong appointed him to the WCG's advisory council of <b>elders,</b> <b>and</b> eventually, Armstrong named him Director of Church Administration, one of the most prominent administrative positions other than Armstrong himself.|$|E

5|$|It {{keeps its}} {{distance}} from mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly {{to avoid the}} disputes which would accompany these endorsements. As an organisation, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations and is not funded by anyone, in fact members have to bear their own expenditures. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum). The emphasis has never been on book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication.|$|E
5|$|The Minister of the Interior is {{responsible}} for the national police force, paramilitary force (gendarmerie) and the secret police. The police and gendarmerie are stationed and administered at the local level. However, in 2009 fewer than a third of all communes had access to the services of these security forces, with most lacking local-level headquarters for either corps. Traditional community tribunals, called dina, are presided over by <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> other respected figures and remain a key means by which justice is served in rural areas where state presence is weak. Historically, security has been relatively high across the island. Violent crime rates are low, and criminal activities are predominantly crimes of opportunity such as pickpocketing and petty theft, although child prostitution, human trafficking and the production and sale of marijuana and other illegal drugs are increasing. Budget cuts since 2009 have severely impacted the national police force, producing a steep increase in criminal activity in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death, those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning. A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state. Yet this reverence for <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.|$|E

5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{success of the}} First Serbian Uprising, by 1813 the Ottomans had reoccupied vast areas of Serbia {{that had once been}} under rebel control and {{captured}} Belgrade. Once Serbia was firmly in their control, the Ottomans carried out numerous revenge killings throughout the countryside. Following these attacks, the Grand Vizier declared an amnesty, and many Serbs who had gone into hiding returned to their homes. Given Serbia's lack of good roads, the Ottomans had to rely on some of the former Serb rebels, such as Stanoje Glavaš and Miloš Obrenović, to maintain order and collect taxes on their behalf. This arrangement remained unchanged until early 1815, when the Ottomans turned on some of the former rebels and killed them. Rumours of an impending Ottoman assault spread quickly throughout Serbia. In April 1815, on Palm Sunday, Serb <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> leaders met in the village of Takovo and elected Obrenović their leader. Shortly afterwards, the Serbs rose in revolt, inflicting a series of humiliating defeats on the Ottomans, in what {{came to be known as}} the Second Serbian Uprising. In subsequent peace treaties, the Serbs were granted autonomy, and Obrenović was recognized as the Prince of Serbia.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{populations were}} {{for the most part}} also moving (to a lesser extent) south and east, which by the 4th century caused a {{lessening}} of the population density in northern and central Poland with a simultaneous settlement concentration increases in Lesser Poland and Silesia. The Przeworsk people there {{at this point in time}} are often identified with the Vandals Germanic tribe. The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure, caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich, the warriors, the tribal <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> rulers, who controlled the trade, imposed contributions and plundered. During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases. There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited, which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave. Most burials were getting more poorly equipped, in comparison with the previous periods. Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form, but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps, found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland, through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy, demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship.|$|E

5|$|When Charles {{attempted}} to impose his religious policies in Scotland he faced numerous difficulties. Although born in Scotland, Charles had become estranged from his northern kingdom; {{his first visit}} since early childhood was for his Scottish coronation in 1633. To the dismay of the Scots, who had removed many traditional rituals from their liturgical practice, Charles insisted that the coronation be conducted in the Anglican rite. In 1637, the king ordered {{the use of a}} new prayer book in Scotland that was almost identical to the English Book of Common Prayer, without consulting either the Scottish Parliament or the Kirk. Although written, under Charles's direction, by Scottish bishops, many Scots resisted it, seeing the new prayer book as a vehicle for introducing Anglicanism to Scotland. On 23 July, riots erupted in Edinburgh upon the first Sunday of the prayer book's usage, and unrest spread throughout the Kirk. The public began to mobilise around a reaffirmation of the National Covenant, whose signatories pledged to uphold the reformed religion of Scotland and reject any innovations that were not authorised by Kirk and Parliament. When the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in November 1638, it condemned the new prayer book, abolished episcopal church government by bishops, and adopted Presbyterian government by <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> deacons.|$|E
5|$|When {{high school}} {{students}} followed the lead of their <b>elders</b> <b>and</b> demonstrated, Diệm had them arrested as well. Two of the detained students were paraded {{at a press conference}} in which they falsely admitted to being communists who had brainwashed their entire school, having been tortured to force their confession. At Trung Vuong, an elite girls' high school, the students hung up banners attacking Diệm and the Nhus, while students from the corresponding boys' schools became violent, smashing school windows and erecting banners that insulted Madame Nhu in explicit language. More than 1000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of public servants and military officers, were sent to re-education camps. The result was that many army officers and senior civil servants had to lobby to have their children or younger siblings released from jail, causing a further drop in morale among government and military officials. In more extreme cases, brawls broke out between police officers arresting students, and the students' parents, many of whom were military officers and/or public servants.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of the Ortega's defeat reached the Governor-General, better-armed {{reinforcements}} from Manila were sent to Tayabas. On November 1, 1841, Col. Joaquín Huet arrived in Tayabas with 800 to 1,000 soldiers. They initially offered government amnesty to the cofradía with the exception of Hermano Pule and other senior leaders, but the cofradía refused. Prior to Colonel Huet's arrival, Pule and the cofradía leaders promised their followers of victory through divine intervention. The cofradía fighters were made to believe that they were invulnerable to enemy bullets, and that angels from Heaven would come down and help them in battle, and finally the ground would open up and swallow the enemy troops. The battle between the cofradía and the government forces lasted for four hours. Three hundred to five hundred men, women, <b>elders,</b> <b>and</b> children were killed on the cofradía side. Afterwards, 500 were taken prisoner, including 300 women. The rest of the cofradía escaped to the forests and were not pursued. Only 11 were wounded on the government's side.|$|E
