50|$|The 1851 census was {{the first}} to record the full <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> {{location}} for individuals.

40|$|Breast {{cancer and}} month <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> Sir- An {{examination}} of the months <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> 1165 women with breast cancer in Athens suggested {{a higher incidence of}} this disease among those born in the Spring and in September than in other months (Vassilaros et al., 1985). This report prompted us to examine the months <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> 32, 221 women with breast cancer in Scotland. The Scottish Cancer Registration Scheme provided <b>details</b> <b>of</b> over 54, 000 registrations of breast cancer for the years 1959 - 84. For {{the purpose of the present}} investigation, it was decided to limit the analysis to years <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> (a) with reasonably large numbers of cases, and (b) for which <b>details</b> <b>of</b> months <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> were available for the general population of Scotland. These considerations have led us to examine the 35, 091 cases in women born in the years 1896 - 1912 an...|$|R

5000|$|Families were {{arranged}} {{in alphabetical order}} by surname, and each family article was headed with the surname {{and the name of}} their landed property, e.g. [...] "Capron of Southwick Hall". There was then a paragraph on the owner of the property, with his coat of arms illustrated, and all his children and remoter male-line descendants also listed, each with full names and <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> marriage, death, and any matters tending to enhance their social prestige, such as school and university education, military rank and regiment, Church of England cures held, and other honours and socially approved involvements. Cross references were included to other families in Burke's Landed Gentry or in Burke's Peerage and Baronetage: thus encouraging browsing through connections. Professional details were not usually mentioned unless they conferred some social status, such as those of civil service and colonial officials, judges and barristers.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} early {{childhood}} education has become a focus for ambitious reforms in China. The emphasis on early experiences {{in this study was}} designed to address issues of unequal life chances, that is, the opportunities that individuals have to improve their lives across the life span. Children in rural China are more likely to be educationally disadvantaged and lack of birth registration compounds this problem. This paper examines data from rural China that was designed to collect household information including <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth</b> registration. The survey data indicated that a significant number of children in the study had no birth registration. Here we contrast the families with a registered child and the families with an unregistered child in relation to their knowledge of childrearing and how their knowledge and beliefs were put into practice. Findings indicate that there were identifiable differences in the two groups and these may be significant for policy makers and local governments when designing interventions to assist in alleviating poverty...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{ascertain}} why parents use {{an accident}} and emergency department for health care for their infants. DESIGN [...] Prospective one month study. SETTING [...] One {{accident and emergency department}} of a children's hospital in the east end of London. SUBJECTS [...] Parents of 159 infants aged < 9 months attending as self referrals (excluding infants attending previously or inpatients within one month, parents advised by the hospital to attend if concerned about their child's health, infants born abroad and arrived in Britain within the previous month). MAIN MEASURES [...] <b>Details</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth,</b> postnatal hospital stay, contact with health professionals, perceptions of roles of community midwife and health visitor, and current attendance obtained from a semistructured questionnaire administered in the department by a research health visitor; diagnosis, discharge, and follow up. RESULTS [...] 152 (96 %) parents were interviewed, 43 (28 %) of whom were single parent and 68 (45 %) first time mothers. Presenting symptoms included diarrhoea or vomiting, or both (34, 22 %), crying (21, 14 %), and feeding difficulties (10, 7 %). Respiratory or gastrointestinal infection was diagnosed in 70 (46 %) infants. Only 17 (11 %) infants were admitted; hospital follow up was arranged for 27 (20 %) infants not admitted. Most (141, 94 %) parents were registered with a general practitioner; 146 (27 %) had contact with the community midwife and 135 (89 %) the health visitor. CONCLUSION [...] Most attendances were for problems more appropriately dealt with by primary care professionals owing to patients' perceptions of hospital and primary health care services. IMPLICATIONS [...] Closer cooperation within the health service is needed to provide a service responsive to the real needs of patients...|$|E
