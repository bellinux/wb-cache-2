5|$|The HDMI {{alternate}} mode {{enables the}} reversible USB-C connector {{to be used}} with the HDMI source devices (mobile, tablet, laptop). This cable will connect to video display/sink devices using any of the native HDMI connectors. This is an <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable,</b> in this case a USB-C to <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable.</b>|$|E
5|$|An <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable</b> is {{composed}} of four shielded twisted pairs, with impedance {{of the order of}} 100Ω (±15%), plus seven separate conductors. HDMI cables with Ethernet differ in that three of the separate conductors instead form an additional shielded twisted pair (with the CEC/DDC ground as a shield).|$|E
5|$|HDMI Ethernet Channel {{technology}} consolidates video, audio, {{and data}} streams {{into a single}} <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable,</b> and the HEC feature enables IP-based applications over HDMI and provides a bidirectional Ethernet communication at 100Mbit/s. The physical layer of the Ethernet implementation uses a hybrid to simultaneously send and receive attenuated 100BASE-TX type signals through a single twisted pair.|$|E

50|$|RM1689 IC — a {{semiconductor}} device which runs on very little power, {{so it can}} draw the current it needs through the HDMI signal itself. It allows <b>HDMI</b> <b>cables</b> to be manufactured at lower cost with the same results as regular <b>HDMI</b> <b>cables.</b> By using a lot less copper, it allows for thinner and more flexible cables. This was demonstrated in the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.|$|R
5|$|HDMI {{manufacturers}} pay {{an annual}} fee of US$10,000 plus a royalty rate of $0.15 per unit, reduced to $0.05 if the HDMI logo is used, and further reduced to $0.04 if HDCP is also implemented. An alternative fee for HDMI manufacturers making fewer than 10,000 units per year is an annual fee of $5,000 with a royalty rate of $1 per unit. The royalty only applies to final products {{and does not}} apply to products that are included in, or with, a licensed HDMI product that is already subject to the royalty. For example, an <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable</b> sold directly to consumers is paid for by the cable manufacturer; however, if the cable manufacturer sells the <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable</b> to a HDTV manufacturer (who then includes the cable with an HDTV subject to the royalty) then the HDTV manufacturer pays only the royalty on the HDTV.|$|E
5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} to pass closed caption data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable</b> to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a DVD player that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.4 was {{released}} on May 28, 2009, and the first HDMI 1.4 products were available {{in the second half}} of 2009. HDMI 1.4 added support for 4K×2K, i.e. 4096×2160 at 24Hz (which is a resolution used with digital theaters), 3840×2160 (Ultra HD) at 24Hz/25Hz/30Hz, and support for 1080p at 120Hz. It also added an HDMI Ethernet Channel (HEC) which allows for a 100Mbit/s Ethernet connection between the two HDMI connected devices so they can share an Internet connection, introduced an audio return channel (ARC), 3D Over HDMI, a new Micro HDMI Connector, an expanded set of color spaces with the addition of sYCC601, Adobe RGB and Adobe YCC601, and an Automotive Connection System. HDMI 1.4 defined several stereoscopic 3D formats including field alternative (interlaced), frame packing (a full resolution top-bottom format), line alternative full, side-by-side half, side-by-side full, 2D + depth, and 2D + depth + graphics + graphics depth (WOWvx). HDMI 1.4 requires that 3D displays implement the frame packing 3D format at either 720p50 and 1080p24 or 720p60 and 1080p24. High Speed HDMI cables as defined in HDMI 1.3 work with all HDMI 1.4 features except for the HDMI Ethernet Channel, which requires the new High Speed <b>HDMI</b> <b>Cable</b> with Ethernet defined in HDMI 1.4.|$|E

25|$|A {{charging}} grip {{is available}} for the Joy-Con, which provides a means to attach a USB-C cable for power. Alongside that, Nintendo released a charging strap that allows players to charge an individual Joy-Con via embedded AA batteries. Nintendo offers a Joy-Con Wheel, a small steering wheel-like unit that a Joy-Con can slot into, allowing it {{to be used for}} racing games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Switch supports the wireless Pro Controller, which has a more traditional design reminiscent of the Wii Classic Controller Pro and Wii U Pro Controller. As of Switch System Software 3.0.0 a setting can be turned on to use the controller in wired USB mode, however currently this will disable the NFC touchpoint. Standalone Docks are available, which include the power adapter and <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable.</b> Third parties also support the Switch with additional accessories, such as carrying cases and screen protectors. The 4.0.0 system update enabled support for GameCube controllers attached via USB with the Wii U GameCube adapter.|$|E
500|$|Although no {{maximum length}} for an <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable</b> is specified, signal {{attenuation}} (dependent on the cable's construction quality and conducting materials) limits usable lengths {{in practice and}} certification is difficult to achieve for lengths beyond 13m. HDMI 1.3 defines two cable categories: Category 1-certified cables, which have been tested at 74.5MHz (which would include resolutions such as 720p60 and 1080i60), and Category 2-certified cables, which have been tested at 340MHz (which would include resolutions such as 1080p60 and 2160p30). Category 1 HDMI cables are marketed as [...] "Standard" [...] and Category 2 HDMI cables as [...] "High Speed". This labeling guideline for HDMI cables went into effect on October 17, 2008. Category 1 and 2 cables can either meet the required parameter specifications for interpair skew, far-end crosstalk, attenuation and differential impedance, or they can meet the required nonequalized/equalized eye diagram requirements. A cable of about [...] can be manufactured to Category 1 specifications easily and inexpensively by using 28AWG (0.081mm²) conductors. With better quality construction and materials, including 24AWG (0.205mm²) conductors, an <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable</b> can reach lengths of up to [...] Many HDMI cables under 5meters of length that were made before the HDMI 1.3 specification can work as Category 2 cables, but only Category 2-tested cables are guaranteed to work for Category 2 purposes.|$|E
500|$|For digital audio, if an HDMI device has audio, it is {{required}} to implement the baseline format: stereo (uncompressed) PCM. Other formats are optional, with HDMI allowing up to 8 channels of uncompressed audio at sample sizes of 16-bit, 20-bit and 24-bit, with sample rates of 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz, 96kHz, 176.4kHz and 192kHz. HDMI also carries any IEC 61937-compliant compressed audio stream, such as Dolby Digital and DTS, and up to 8 channels of one-bit DSD audio (used on Super Audio CDs) at rates up to four times that of Super Audio CD. With version 1.3, HDMI allows lossless compressed audio streams Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. [...] As with the YCbCr video, audio capability is optional. Audio return channel (ARC) is a feature introduced in the HDMI 1.4 standard. [...] "Return" [...] refers to the case where the audio comes from the TV and can be sent [...] "upstream" [...] to the AV receiver using the <b>HDMI</b> <b>cable</b> connected to the AV receiver. An example given on the HDMI website is that a TV that directly receives a terrestrial/satellite broadcast, or has a video source built in, sends the audio [...] "upstream" [...] to the AV receiver.|$|E
50|$|PowerConnect 5500 series switches, the {{successor}} of the 5400 series, {{are based on}} Marvell technology. They offer 24 or 48 Gigabit Ethernet ports with (-P series) or without PoE.

All 5500 series models (5524, 5524P, 5548 and 5548P) can be combined in a single stack with up to 8 units per stack. The 5500 series uses standard <b>HDMI</b> <b>cables</b> (specification 1.4 category 2 or better) to stack with a total bandwidth of 40 Gbit/s per switch.|$|R
