40|$|An {{optically}} triggered {{liquid crystal}} infiltrated Q-switched photonic crystal laser is demonstrated. A photonic crystal laser cavity {{was designed and}} fabricated to support two orthogonally polarized high-Q cavity modes after liquid crystal infiltration. By controlling the liquid crystal orientation via a layer of photoaddressable polymer and a writing laser, the photonic crystal lasing mode can be reversibly switched between the two modes which also switches the laser’s emission polarization and wavelength. The creation of the Q-switched laser demonstrates the benefits of customizing photonic crystal cavities to maximally synergize with an infiltrated material and illustrates the potential of <b>integrating</b> <b>semiconductor</b> nanophotonics with optical materials...|$|R
50|$|After the {{invention}} of microtechnology (~1954) for realizing <b>integrated</b> <b>semiconductor</b> structures for microelectronic chips, these lithography-based technologies were soon applied in pressure sensor manufacturing (1966) as well.

50|$|Photonic {{integrated}} circuits (PICs) are optically active <b>integrated</b> <b>semiconductor</b> photonic devices which consist {{of at least}} two different functional blocks, (gain region and a grating based mirror in a laser...). These devices are responsible for commercial successes of optical communications and the ability to increase the available bandwidth without significant cost increases to the end user, through improved performance and cost reduction that they provide. The most widely deployed PICs are based on Indium phosphide material system. Silicon photonics is an active area of research.|$|E
5000|$|The charge {{generated}} by the piezoelectric element in the switch is typically used to turn on an <b>integrated</b> <b>semiconductor</b> device such as a field effect transistor (FET), causing the switch assembly's output to be active, or [...] "on". When the FET is on, current can flow through it as with a conventional metal contact-based switch. After the voltage pulse is dissipated in the gate resistor, the FET turns back [...] "off", its normal high impedance state. The piezoelectric effect uses the fact that force applied to certain materials causes stresses that generate this electric charge. In the case of piezo switches, the force could be compressive pressure that causes the (typically disc-shaped) piezo element to bend very slightly like a drumhead.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the rapid}} {{adoption}} of the modern day chip in the 1960s, most companies involved in producing semiconductors were extremely vertically <b>integrated.</b> <b>Semiconductor</b> companies owned and operated their own fabrication plants and also the processing technologies that facilitated {{the creation of the}} chips. Research, design, testing, production, and manufacturing were all kept [...] "in house".Advances in the semiconductor industry made the market extremely competitive and companies began to use a technology roadmap that helped set goals for the industry. This roadmap became to be known as Moore's Law, a statistical trend seen by Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore in which the number of transistors on an integrated circuit is doubled approximately every 2 years. This increase in transistor numbers meant that chips were getting smaller and faster as time progressed.|$|E

5000|$|Forrester's coincident-current system {{required}} one of {{the wires}} to be run at 45 degrees to the cores, which proved impossible to wire by machine, so that core arrays had to be assembled under microscopes by workers with fine motor control. Initially, garment workers were used. By the late 1950s industrial plants {{had been set up}} in East Asia to build core. Inside, hundreds of workers strung cores for low pay. This lowered the cost of core {{to the point where it}} became largely universal as main memory by the early 1960s, replacing both inexpensive low-performance drum memory and costly high-performance systems using vacuum tubes, and later transistors, as memory. The cost of core memory declined sharply over the lifetime of the technology: costs began at roughly [...] per bit and dropped to roughly [...] per bit. Core was replaced by <b>integrated</b> <b>semiconductor</b> RAM chips in the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a series}} of {{published}} articles from 1974-1979, and then in his 1988 book Mind Children, computer scientist and futurist Hans Moravec generalizes Moore's law to make predictions {{about the future of}} artificial life. Moore's law describes an exponential growth pattern in the complexity of <b>integrated</b> <b>semiconductor</b> circuits. Moravec extends this to include technologies from long before the integrated circuit to future forms of technology. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario in which robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030-2040.In Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind, published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving robot intelligence, generalizing Moore's Law to technologies predating the integrated circuit, and also plotting the exponentially increasing computational power of the brains of animals in evolutionary history. Extrapolating these trends, he speculates about a coming [...] "mind fire" [...] of rapidly expanding superintelligence similar to the explosion of intelligence predicted by Vinge.|$|E
