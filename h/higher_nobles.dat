60|$|While the barons and knights {{were thus}} amusing {{themselves}} {{at the beginning of}} Richard's reign with fighting for castles and provinces, either for the pleasure of fighting, or {{for the sake of the}} renown or the plunder which they acquired when they were fortunate enough to gain the victory, the great mass of the people of England were taxed and oppressed by their haughty masters to an extent almost incredible. The <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> were absolutely above all law. One of them, who was going to set off on a naval expedition into France, seized, in the English sea-port which he was leaving, a number of women, the wives and daughters of the citizens, and took them on board his ship, to be at the disposal there of himself and his fellow grandees. For this intolerable injury the husbands and fathers had absolutely no remedy. To crown the wickedness of this deed, when, soon after the fleet had left the port, a storm arose, and the women were terrified at the danger they were in, and their fright, added to the distress they felt at being thus torn away from their families and homes, made them completely and uncontrollably wretched, the merciless nobles threw them overboard to stop their cries.|$|E
60|$|Not {{long after}} they reached that city the Cardinal of Perigord and another legate {{presented}} themselves to arrange peace, and these negotiations went on throughout the winter. The prince had received full powers from his father, and his demands were very moderate; {{but in spite of}} this no final peace could be arranged, and the result of the conference was the proclamation of a truce, to last for two years from the following Easter. During the winter immense numbers of the prisoners who had gone at large upon patrol, came in and paid their ransoms, as did the <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> who had been taken prisoners, and the whole army was greatly enriched. At the end of April the prince returned to England with King John. The procession through the streets of London was a magnificent one, the citizens vying with each other in decorating their houses in honour of the victor of Poitiers, who, simply dressed, rode on a small black horse by the side of his prisoner, who was splendidly attired, and mounted on a superb white charger. The king received his royal prisoner in state in the great hall of his palace at Westminster, and did all in his power to alleviate the sorrows of his condition. The splendid palace of the Savoy, with gardens extending to the Thames, was appointed for his residence, and every means was taken to soften his captivity.|$|E
60|$|Cressingham {{was among}} the number killed. It was said by one English historian, and his account has been copied by many others, that Cressingham's body was flayed and his skin divided among the Scots; but there appears no good {{foundation}} for the story, although probably Cressingham, who had rendered himself peculiarly obnoxious and hateful to the Scots, was hewn in pieces. But even were it proved that the ill story is a true one, it need excite no surprise, seeing the wholesale slaying, plundering, and burning which had been carried on by the English, and that the Scottish prisoners falling into their hands were often mutilated and tortured before being executed and quartered. The English historians were fond of crying out that the Scotch were a cruel and barbarous people whenever they retaliated for the treatment which they suffered; but so far from this being the case, {{it is probable that}} the Scotch, before the first invasion of Edward, were a more enlightened and, for their numbers, a more well-to-do people than the English. They had for many years enjoyed peace and tranquillity, and under the long and prosperous reign of Alexander had made great advances, while England had been harassed by continuous wars and troubles at home and abroad. Its warlike barons, when not engaged under its monarchs in wars in Wales, Ireland, and France, occupied themselves in quarrels with each other, or in struggles against the royal supremacy; and although the <b>higher</b> <b>nobles,</b> with their mailclad followers, could show an amount of chivalrous pomp unknown in Scotland, yet the condition of the middle classes and of the agricultural population was higher in Scotland than in England.|$|E

5000|$|The court {{developed}} gradually {{during the}} early 12th century AD, along with the kingdom itself, {{in the aftermath of}} the First Crusade. Technically all vassals of the king which were subject to its decisions had the right to sit and vote, but in practice only the more wealthy nobles did so; certain nobles attended regularly and tended to serve as presiding judges when necessary. This developed into a system of <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> (direct vassals of the king) and lesser nobles (indirect vassals, who owed service to the <b>higher</b> <b>nobles),</b> with different privileges depending on idiosyncratic circumstances. Anyone who had committed perjury or had broken an oath (whether a higher or lesser noble) forfeited his right to speak and vote. Only four votes (the king and any three vassals) were required to form a quorum.|$|E
50|$|On 23 January 1719, Charles VI {{created the}} new principality of Liechtenstein from {{the domains of}} Seigneury of Schellenberg and County of Vaduz, which were both held by the Liechtenstein family.

50|$|The film is only {{loosely based}} on reality. William d'Aubigny {{commanded}} the garrison but contemporary chroniclers do not agree on how many men it consisted of. Estimates range from 95 to 140 knights supported by crossbowmen, sergeants, and others. John did take the castle, most of the <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> being imprisoned or banished; and the French did not arrive in England until some {{six months after the}} siege had ended. Characters departing significantly from the historical record include William d'Aubigny, who was not an ennobled wool merchant (nor was he tortured and killed in the siege).|$|E
50|$|When Kerbogha was defeated, Adhemar {{organized}} a council {{in an attempt}} to settle the leadership disputes, but he died on 1 August 1098, probably of typhus. The disputes among the <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> went unsolved and the march to Jerusalem was delayed for months. However, the lower-class soldiers continued to think of Adhemar as a leader. Some of them claimed to have been visited by his ghost during the siege of Jerusalem and reported that Adhemar instructed them to hold another procession around the walls. This was done and Jerusalem was taken by the Crusaders in 1099.|$|E
50|$|In 1144, the Commune of Rome {{attempted}} {{to establish a}} government modeled on the old Roman republic {{in opposition to the}} temporal power of the <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> and the pope. This included setting up a senate {{along the lines of the}} ancient one. The revolutionaries divided Rome into fourteen regions, each electing four senators for a total of 56 (although one source, often repeated, gives a total of 50). These senators, the first real senators since the 7th century, elected as their leader Giordano Pierleoni, son of the Roman consul Pier Leoni, with the title patrician, since the term consul had been deprecated as a noble styling.|$|E

50|$|The Assise {{also made}} all nobles direct vassals of the king, {{eliminating}} the previous distinction between higher and lesser nobles. This distinction still existed in reality, {{and although they}} theoretically had an equal voice in the Haute Cour, lesser nobles could only appeal to the high court when their own baronial courts refused to hear their complaints. In any case, the more powerful barons refused to be tried by lesser lords who were not their peers, and the <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> were still able to judge the less powerful lords themselves. There were about 600 men eligible {{to vote in the}} Court according to the Assise.|$|E
50|$|This order {{distinguished}} {{those who}} proved {{their loyalty to}} the Portuguese Royal House {{in the war against}} the Bonapartist occupying forces. Later, in 1818, a royal decree stated that the Order would be given as a military award in four (4) classes of Grand Cross, Commander, Knight, and Servant. Knighthood was given to those who were servants to the king and devoted Catholics to the pope and the Holy Mother. The Order was originally limited to twelve Grand Crosses, forty Commanders and one hundred Knights, with the provision for the award of supernumerary Grand Crosses. Grand Crosses were usually given to <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> who had positions in the Royal Household. Lower grades (Commander and below) were granted to lesser nobles who had provided personal service to the King.|$|E
5000|$|From the Middle Ages until 1792, the Palatinate {{was divided}} into 45 secular and ecclesiastical territories, {{some of which were}} very small. The largest and most {{important}} of these was the Electorate of the Palatinate (Kurpfalz), a number of territories {{on both sides of the}} Rhine formerly held by the Counts palatine (Pfalzgrafen) of Lotharingia. By the late 12th century, the Count palatine had achieved the status of a Prince-elector (Kurfürst), becoming one of the seven <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> with the privilege of electing the Emperor, as confirmed by the Golden Bull of 1356. In 1214 the Bavarian House of Wittelsbach was enfeoffed with these estates, which they ruled until 1918, together with the collateral branch of Palatinate-Zweibrücken from 1410. They lost control with the reunification with Bavaria under Elector Charles Theodore in 1777.|$|E

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} piece of legislation passed by the court was Amalric I's Assise sur la ligece. The Assise formally prohibited the illegal confiscation of fiefs and required all of the king's vassals to ally against any lord who did so. Such a lord would not be given a trial, but would instead be stripped of his land or exiled. It also made all nobles direct vassals of the king, eliminating the previous distinction between higher and lesser nobles. This distinction still existed in reality, and although lesser nobles now had an equal voice in the court, the more powerful barons refused to be tried by lesser lords who were not their peers. The <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> were still able to judge the less powerful lords themselves. There were about 600 men eligible {{to vote in the}} Court according to the Assise.|$|E
5000|$|In later medieval times, {{the title}} [...] "senator" [...] {{was still in}} {{occasional}} use, but {{it had become a}} meaningless adjunct title of nobility and no longer implied membership in an organized governing body.

5000|$|Before the Ostsiedlung, urban {{settlements}} of the emporia and gard types {{existed for}} example the city of Szczecin (Stettin) which counted between 5,000 and 9,000 inhabitants, and other locations like Demmin, Wolgast, Usedom, Wollin/Wolin, Kolberg/Kołobrzeg, Pyritz/Pyrzyce and Stargard, though many of the coastal ones declined during the 12th century warfare. Previous theories that urban development was [...] "in its entirety" [...] brought to areas such as Pomerania, Mecklenburg or Poland by Germans are now discarded, and studies show that these areas had already growing urban centres in process similar to Western Europe These population centres were usually centered on a gard, which was a fortified castle which housed the castellan {{as well as his}} staff and the ducal craftsmen. The surrounding town consisted of suburbs, inhabited by merchants, clergy and the <b>higher</b> <b>nobles.</b> According to Piskorski this portion usually included [...] "markets, taverns, butcher shops, mints, which also exchanged coins, toll stations, abbeys, churches and the houses of nobles".
