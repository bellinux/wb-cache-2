5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that <b>is</b> <b>quiet,</b> very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown}} to disrupt continuous sleep.

Occasionally, individual snakes will reveal their presence with a loud and sustained hissing, hoping to warn off potential aggressors. Often, these {{turn out to be}} pregnant females. When the adder is threatened, the front part of the body is drawn into an S-shape to prepare for a strike.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the student}} {{population}} associated with the Universidad de las Américas, and the area's popularity with tourists, the city has a lively nightclub and bar scene, mostly concentrated around the main plaza and {{in a part of the}} San Andrés municipality.

This also includes a line of strip clubs along Avenida 14 Oeste between 5 de Mayo and Calle 2 Norte.

25|$|Castlefield {{is an area}} in {{the extreme}} {{southwest}} between Deansgate and the River Irwell with the sites of the Roman fort and Liverpool Road Railway Station.

25|$|The town of Capula <b>is</b> <b>quiet</b> colonial town {{located between}} Lake Patzcuaro {{and the city}} of Morelia. The most {{traditional}} is kitchenware such as pots and plates, which are decorated in small painted dots in a style known here as puntillaje, often to form flowers. This technique dates back to the clay pots from the pre Hispanic era. Since the 1980s, it has also been known for the making of ceramic images of La Catrina, a figure initially created by graphic artist Jose Guadalupe Posada. This began in the workshop of Juan Torres, who took the skeletal figure and made his own variations on the theme. Since then, most artisans in the town have turned to the making of these figures, some in more modern dress and even male versions called Catrinos. Capula attracts some tourists who come to see the demonstrations of how the wares are made. This small town is {{the only one in the}} state that boasts government certifications of origin for three of its products, punteada pottery, the Catrinas and a simpler pottery called loza tradicional.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{is situated}} on {{the foothills of the}} Sierra Nevada between the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl and in the Moctezuma-Panuco River. The Sierra Nevada is the most important geographical feature of the region and forms the eastern border of the municipality. These volcanoes are responsible for the compositions of the soils here as well as the source of most of the municipality’s fresh water. The average altitude in these mountains is 4,000 meters above sea level with the highest elevations at the Iztaccíhuatl and Popocatépetl volcanos. Although near the active volcano, Amecameca is considered to be at a lower risk than other communities in the area because of the shape of Popocatépetl’s cone and the large ravines that are found in this area. The latter offers protection against lava flows and runoff from melting snow. However, the area remains part of the evacuation zone {{in the event of a}} major eruption. There is a lookout station on Sacromonte hill which is used by civil defense when the volcano is more active. The area has an eruption warning system of three colors—red, yellow and green—which depend on the status of Popocatepetl. Green means that the volcano <b>is</b> <b>quiet,</b> yellow that there is activity and caution is advised and red indicates a current or imminent eruption. When the status turns to yellow, tourism to the area plummets to about half normal.|$|E
