5|$|After four years, {{the story}} {{presents}} tax attorney Loudon Trott (Griffin Dunne) {{on a busy}} day. He is getting married to the daughter {{of one of the}} richest men in New York, Simon Worthington. Loudon's bride Wendy Worthington (Haviland Morris) is a selfish woman who is more consumed in her wedding plans than in the well-being of her fiancé. Loudon, on the other hand, has a number of duties entrusted to him by his boss (and future father-in-law), Mr. Worthington (John McMartin). First he has to pick up a cougar for an exotic animal activist named Montgomery Bell (John Mills), then to pick up Nikki, and lastly <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that Nikki catches the next bus to her hometown of Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|At Massive Dynamic, Brandon (Ryan McDonald) theorizes to {{the team}} that Observers are time travelers, {{as they have been}} {{documented}} during several major events in history. They write in an incomprehensible language, and the number of Observer sightings has increased over the past few months, leaving the team wondering why. Meanwhile, August visits the other Observers, who are not happy that he saved a girl who was supposed to die in the plane crash. To correct his mistake, they send Donald Long (Paul Rae), an assassin affiliated with the Observers to correct August's actions. In an attempt to save Christine, August sends a secret message to Walter. During the meeting, August reveals Christine will die because she is not important; Walter tells August that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her important.|$|E

25|$|In an invited comment (Seymann, 1991) and in {{subsequent}} {{letters to the}} editor, (vos Savant, 1991c; Rao, 1992; Bell, 1992; Hogbin and Nijdam, 2010) Morgan et al. were supported by some writers, criticized by others; in each case a response by Morgan et al. is published alongside the letter or comment in The American Statistician. In particular, vos Savant defended herself vigorously. Morgan et al. complained in their response to vos Savant (1991c) that vos Savant still had not actually responded to their own main point. Later in their response to Hogbin and Nijdam (2011), they did agree that it was natural to suppose that the host chooses a door to open completely at random, when {{he does have a}} choice, and hence that the conditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., conditional given the situation the player is in when <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> his choice) has the same value, , as the unconditional probability of winning by switching (i.e., averaged over all possible situations). This equality was already emphasized by Bell (1992), who suggested that Morgan et al.'s mathematically involved solution would only appeal to statisticians, whereas the equivalence of the conditional and unconditional solutions in the case of symmetry was intuitively obvious.|$|E
25|$|Gentle {{makes it}} to the top of the palace where he {{encounters}} the Autarch, who reveals that Gentle is the Maestro Sartori, who led the failed effort to reconcile the dominions 200 years before. Going to see the Pivot, Gentle is told that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> another attempt at reconciliation. Through explanation by the Autarch and a vision he witnesses, the true events of what happened 200 years before are finally revealed. As Sartori, he was in love with Judith, the lover of Joshua Godolphin, and was able to convince Joshua to let him create a replica of her through magic. During the long process of replicating her however, he got drunk and went into the circle that she was being replicated in, and made love to her. This resulted in a replica of himself being created as well. Once the reconciliation failed, the replica of Sartori left to the dominions and eventually became the ruler of them as the Autarch. The original Judith became his queen, Quaisoir, while the replica, the Judith we've come to know throughout the book, remained on Earth, bound to the Godolphin family. Sartori convinced Pie to cast a feit on him that caused him to continuously lose his memory of the event. The Autarch wants Gentle to join him as he goes to conquer the Fifth Dominion but Gentle refuses. While fleeing, Pie comes across the Autarch, and attacks Gentle when he arrives. Although Gentle is able to convince Pie that it's the real him, the Autarch (referred to from this point on through the rest of the book as 'Sartori') attacks Pie, mortally wounding him, then escapes.|$|E
500|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson {{notes that}} two of the stories ("Quantum of Solace" [...] and [...] "The Hildebrand Rarity") are {{experimental}} for Fleming, whilst the remaining three are straightforward Bond adventures. In the two experimental stories Bond is given something of a more human side, with [...] "Quantum of Solace" [...] evidencing Bond's reaction to the Governor's story by showing a compassionate side, as he sees the real life of Philip Masters and Rhoda Llewellyn as being more dramatic than his recent mission; the forthcoming trip <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> to the CIA, he now sees as [...] "dull and unexciting". In [...] "The Hildebrand Rarity", Bond is also shown with a humanitarian side, with feelings for the plight of Liz at the hands of her husband and {{for the use of the}} poison on the fish by Milton Krest.|$|E

500|$|George {{is still}} singing {{as they enter}} Alton Benes's hotel. Elaine has not arrived yet, so they sit down with her father and nervously order drinks. They have an awkward {{conversation}} with him; Alton asks who is the [...] "funny guy" [...] (Jerry), to which George says it's Jerry. Alton then recalls about a funny guy in Korea who got his brains blown out over the Pacific and that [...] "there's nothing funny about that". Jerry (frightened) eventually goes to the bathroom, abandoning George (also frightened), who attempts to compliment Alton about his book, Fair Game. George gets uncomfortable and tells Alton <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a phone call. He meets Jerry {{in the bathroom and}} both mention how terrified they are because of Alton; they decide to go home if Elaine does not show up in the next ten minutes. When they return, Alton receives a message from Elaine, who will arrive in thirty minutes, which worries them both.|$|E
2500|$|While 400 extras were {{recruited}} from agencies for Tag, the actor playing the piece's protagonist was chosen from the street outside the set just before filming began. The crew shot on 16mm film using three cameras to allow editors to cut to different perspectives while keeping each scene to one take. Art director Andy Fackrell warmly welcomed the technique, commenting: [...] "When {{you can get it}} all in one take, it becomes more natural. The camera zooms in on the guy's face when <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a decision. You feel for the guy." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{never even}} heard his name till {{last week when he}} made threats and rants. The guy is a fucking idiot, making threats to me, Clooney, Eli Roth, says he has a doctorate—but uses the word [...] "retard" [...] in his vocabulary, come on. When you look at his videos, what is {{interesting}} are the backgrounds. I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E

2500|$|In Tunisia, {{education}} is free for all Tunisian citizens and for foreigners who have scholarships. The oldest Medical {{school is a}} faculty of the University of Tunis. There are four medicine faculties situated in the major cities of Tunis, Sfax, Sousse and Monastir. Admission is bound to the success and score in the baccalaureate examination. Admission score threshold is very high, based on competition among all applicants throughout the nation. Medical school curriculum consists of five years. The first two years are medical theory, containing all basic sciences related to medicine, and {{the last three years}} consists of clinical issues related to all medical specialties. During these last three years, the student gets the status of [...] "Externe". The student has to attend at the university hospital every day, rotating around all wards. Every period is followed by a clinical exam regarding the student's knowledge in that particular specialty. After those five years, there are two years on internship, in which the student is a physician but {{under the supervision of the}} chief doctor; the student rotates over the major and most essential specialties during period of four months each. After that, student has the choice of either passing the residency national exam or extending his internship for another year, after which he gains the status of family physician. The residency program consists of four to five years in the specialty he qualifies, depending on his score in the national residency examination under the rule of highest score chooses first. Whether the student chooses to be a family doctor or a specialist, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a doctorate thesis, which he will be defending in front of a jury, after which he gains his degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD).|$|E

60|$|To an American visiting Europe, {{the long}} voyage <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> is an {{excellent}} preparative. The temporary absence of worldly scenes and employments produces {{a state of mind}} peculiarly fitted to receive new and vivid impressions. The vast space of waters that separate the hemispheres is like a blank page in existence. There is no gradual transition by which, as in Europe, the features and population of one country blend almost imperceptibly with those of another. From the moment you lose sight of the land you have left, all is vacancy, until you step on the opposite shore, and are launched at once into the bustle and novelties of another world.|$|E
6000|$|But {{some of you}} may say: [...] "We {{understand}} {{the first half of the}} text very well, and like it very well; we all think it just that those who set themselves up should have a fall, and we are very glad to see them have a fall: but we do not see why he who abases himself should have any right to be exalted." [...] Ah, my friends, it is much easier, and needs much less knowledge of God, and much less of the likeness of Christ, to see what is wrong, than to see what is right. Every man knows when a bone is broken, but it is not every one who can set it again. Nevertheless, there is a sort of left-handed reason in that argument. For a man has no more right to make himself out worse than he is, than <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> himself out better than he is. A man should confess to being just what he is, neither more nor less. Nevertheless, he who humbles himself shall be exalted.|$|E
