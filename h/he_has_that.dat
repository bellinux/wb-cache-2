25|$|These {{cautions}} being duly observed, I {{do not see}} how {{any person}} can devote himself too entirely {{to the cause of}} the Apostolical Church in these realms. There may be, as far as he knows, but a very few to sympathise with him. He may have to wait long, and very likely pass out of this world before he see any abatement in the triumph of disorder and irreligion. But, if he be consistent, he possesses, to the utmost, the personal consolations of a good Christian: and as a true Churchman, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> encouragement, which no other cause in the world can impart in the same degree:—he is calmly, soberly, demonstrably, SURE, that, sooner or later, HIS WILL BE THE WINNING SIDE, and that the victory will be complete, universal, eternal.|$|E
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what I try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

500|$|Through mid-May 2008, Kinsler had {{the best}} career stolen-base {{percentage}} (88.5%) of anyone in Rangers/Senators history with at least 40 attempts. [...] "It's part of my game", said Kinsler. [...] "It's {{not one of the}} first things I'm known for." [...] According to scouts, his ability on the basepaths is due to innate instincts and his [...] "twitch speed" [...] rather than his pure running speed. Grouse, who signed him, says that Kinsler also [...] "goes from first to third faster than anyone, because <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> God-given ability to read the ball so well off the bat." ...|$|E

[...] Political columnist David S. Broder has viewed Biden as having grown since he came to Washington and since his failed 1988 presidential bid: [...] "He responds to real people—that's been consistent throughout. And his ability to understand himself and deal with other politicians has gotten much much better." [...] Traub concludes that [...] "Biden is the kind of fundamentally happy person who can be as generous toward others as he is to himself." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter's uncle. Sheen {{admitted}} he was unfamiliar with Spider-Man other than Maguire's portrayal, and knew {{little of the}} character Ben Parker except for knowing Cliff Robertson had played the part. Sheen described his character as a surrogate father, saying, [...] "I'm dealing with this adolescent who is having problems with changes, with hormones changing and his getting out of hand. I {{have to give him}} the marching orders and so forth." [...] Webb said, [...] "You think of Martin Sheen as President Bartlet [...] <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> sense of benevolent authority, but there's something else that's important, in terms of the dynamic that I wanted to explore, vis-à-vis Peter's relationship with his absent parents." [...] Webb felt that unlike the scientifically inclined Peter, Uncle Ben represented the blue-collar working man, a gap that could create a dynamic between the characters.|$|E

500|$|He {{then stepped}} up to twelve furlongs for Britain's most prestigious {{weight-for-age}} race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, {{for which he was}} made 4/6 (0.67-1) favourite. With no three-year-old in the field, the race {{did not appear to be}} up to its usual standard, and his main opponent was expected to be Youmzain who had finished second in the Ascot race and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 2007 and had more recently won the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Duke of Marmalade was settled by Murtagh in the middle of the field before being switched to the outside in the straight and overtaking Red Rock Canyon entering the final furlong. He was immediately challenged and headed by the Michael Stoute-trained Papal Bull but [...] "rallied gamely" [...] to regain the lead close to the finish and win by a half a length. Murtagh was keen to praise the horse's speed and attitude, saying [...] "mine has all that makes a real champion. He looked the other horse in the eye and ate ground. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> will to win." ...|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine guy with a crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Zito {{started off}} with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed one run against Texas. In the process, he became only the fifth A's pitcher to win 10 {{straight}} games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the Rangers. Zito improved to 9–0 in his career against Texas. After the game, Texas manager Buck Showalter said, [...] "I got the feeling he made it look pretty easy. When <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> kind of command, {{you can see what}} happens." [...] Zito struggled in his second-to last start before the All-Star Break on July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. The 15 hits allowed were a career high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was stunned by Zito's bad start. He said, [...] "If you'd have told me we'd get 15 hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at you a little funny." [...] Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. Zito was again named to the All Star team, the second time he has been named to the team.|$|E

500|$|When Eisenhower {{left the}} Mediterranean {{to become the}} Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, Gale {{was one of a}} number of key {{officers}} that Eisenhower insisted on taking with him to his new headquarters, SHAEF. When Field Marshal Brooke demurred at this, Eisenhower's chief of staff, Lieutenant General Walter Bedell Smith pointed out that Eisenhower had always felt [...] "he would be unwilling to undertake another large Allied Command without Gale's administrative assistance .... <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> irreplaceable quality of being able to handle British-American supply problems with tact and judgement and he is almost as familiar with the American system of supply as with the British." [...] However, General Gale found that while his title at SHAEF was the same, his role was different from that at Allied Force Headquarters. In the Mediterranean he had also had broad responsibility for logistics. In the European theatre, General Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group controlled its own supply while the American units had Headquarters, Communications Zone under Major General John C. H. Lee. At SHAEF, Gale had less real control over supply and administration than at Allied Force Headquarters and his duties mostly involved coordinating the activities of the SHAEF staff sections and serving as chairman of various high-level committees that dealt with matters of supply. Gale was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant general in August 1944, and in January 1945 he became Colonel Commandant of the Royal Army Service Corps, a position he held until 1954. He was also colonel commandant of the Army Catering Corps from 1946 to 1958. For his work at SHAEF, he was awarded the U.S. Army Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

He's the full package and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> X-factor about him." [...] Maxwell did some work with Shane Warne to help with his bowling.|$|E

2500|$|Domingo first sang Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini's Tosca in a 1961 {{performance}} in Mexico City. A decade later, {{he made his}} Covent Garden debut in the role. He continued to sing the part for many years, especially at the Met and in Vienna, eventually performing it {{more than any other}} of his roles. In September 1975, Domingo debuted in the title role of Verdi's Otello at the Hamburg State Opera. It soon became his signature role and one of operas he performed most frequently (over 200 times). He recorded the part three times in the studio and appeared in four officially released filmed versions of the opera. Oscar-winning Shakespearean actor, Laurence Olivier, declared after seeing the tenor in the role: [...] "Domingo plays Othello as well as I do and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>that</b> voice." ...|$|E

[...] Jeff Laramore is currently working on an art filled central plaza that will be part of the , Marriott's forthcoming five-in-one hotel collection in downtown Indianapolis. Laramore's 36-foot-tall stylized sculpture of a cardinal (the Indiana state bird) will be the plaza's signature piece.|$|E
