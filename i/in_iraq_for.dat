25|$|Nevertheless, {{the amount}} of land owned by Jews is easier to {{calculate}} than that owned by Arabs. It is difficult to reckon {{the total amount of}} land owned by Arabs (Muslim, Christian and Druze) in Mandatory Palestine. The 1945 UN estimate shows that Arab ownership of arable land was on average 68% of a district, ranging from 15% ownership in the Beer-Sheba district to 99% ownership in the Ramallah district. These data cannot be fully understood without comparing them to those of neighbouring countries: <b>in</b> <b>Iraq,</b> <b>for</b> instance, still in 1951 only 0.3 per cent of registered land (or 50 per cent of the total amount) was categorised as ‘private property’.|$|E
25|$|The unpopular war in Iraq was a {{key issue}} during the {{campaign}} before the economic crisis. John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it (Obama's early and strong {{opposition to the war}} helped him stand out against the other Democratic candidates during the primaries, as well as stand out to a war-weary electorate during the general campaign). Though McCain meant it as a peacetime presence like the United States maintained in Germany and Japan after World War II, his statement that the United States could be <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>for</b> as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly.

25|$|In 1966, the {{original}} Ba'ath Party was split in half; one half {{was led by}} the Damascus leadership of the Ba'ath Party which established a party in Syria, {{and the other half}} with its leadership in Baghdad. Both Ba'ath parties retained the same name and maintained parallel structures in the Arab world, but became so antagonistic that Syria — led by its Ba'ath party — became the only Arab state to support Iran against Iraq during the bloody Iran–Iraq War. Ba'athists seized power <b>in</b> <b>Iraq</b> <b>for</b> the first time in 1963, but were deposed several months later. The party's regional organisation governed Iraq between 1968 and 2003, for many years under the leadership of Saddam Hussein.

He also allegedly entertained relationships with Abu-Khalid al-Suri, al-Qaeda’s top envoy in Syria, who processed a $600,000 transfer to al-Qaeda in 2013. Moreover, Nuaimi is known to be associated with Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani, a Yemeni politician and founding member of Alkarama listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) by the U.S. Treasury in 2013. The U.S. authorities claimed that Humayqani exploited his role in Alkarama to fundraise on behalf of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). A prominent figure among AQAP ranks, he was also reported to have facilitated the flow of funding to AQAP affiliates based in Yemen. Nuaimi was accused of investing funds in the charity directed by Humayqani to ultimately fund AQAP. About ten months after being sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury, Nuaimi was also restrained from doing business in the UK.|$|E

In the August 9, 2009, strip, it was revealed that the grave Becky had visited all these years was that of Wally's assumed remains.

500|$|When the Iraqi Regional Branch seized power, the Syrian Regional Branch {{responded by}} not {{mentioning}} {{in the press}} release that a Ba'ath organisation had taken power <b>in</b> <b>Iraq.</b> <b>For</b> instance, it mentioned that Bakr had been appointed president, but did not mention his party's affiliation, and instead referred to the incident as a military coup. While the Syrian Ba'ath denied giving any legitimacy to Iraqi Ba'ath, the Iraqi Ba'ath were more conciliatory. For instance, Bakr stated [...] "They are Ba'athists, we are Ba'athists" [...] shortly after the Iraqi Regional Branch seized power. Foreign Minister Shaykli stated shortly after that [...] "there is nothing preventing co-operation between us [...] ". The anti-Iraq propaganda reached new heights within Syria {{at the same time}} that Assad was strengthening his position within the party and state.
