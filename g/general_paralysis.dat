2500|$|The first {{systematic}} {{attempt at}} psychosurgery is commonly {{attributed to the}} Swiss psychiatrist Gottlieb Burckhardt who operated on six patients in 1888. In 1889 Thomas Claye Shaw reported mental improvement {{in a case of}} <b>General</b> <b>Paralysis</b> of the Insane after a neurosurgical intervention. This led to a lively debate in the British Medical Journal on the usefulness of neurosurgery for the treatment of insanity. In the 1930s the Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz developed a surgical technique for the treatment of mental illness and called it [...] "leucotomy" [...] or [...] "psychosurgery". Moniz' technique was adapted and promoted by American neurologist Walter Freeman and his neurosurgeon colleague James W. Watts. They called their operation, where burr holes are drilled {{in the side of the}} skull and the white matter is sliced through in order to sever the connections between the frontal lobes and deeper structures in the brain, lobotomy. In the United Kingdom it became known as the standard Freeman-Watts prefrontal leucotomy.

40|$|AbstractReoperation for a {{malfunctioning}} {{central venous catheter}} (CVC) {{is technically}} demanding as a bedside procedure in premature infants, and <b>general</b> anesthesia and <b>paralysis</b> is usually required for such an operation. Herein, we describe a safe and simple reinsertion technique to treat CVC occlusion using the original tract. Using a previous incision, the subcutaneous tract was identified, and the anterior half circle of the tract was opened. The catheter was transected through the opening, and the distal part was removed. A new catheter was introduced through an empty subcutaneous tunneling pathway and skin exit site, where the old distal part had been recently removed. Using fine 6 – 0 monofilament suture, traction sutures were placed along the cut edge of the proximal tract. The proximal part was then removed, and a newly placed catheter tip was inserted into the tract opening. When CVC reinsertion is required in premature infants, reinsertion can be accomplished easily and safely using this technique as a bedside procedure without general anesthesia...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Primary lateral {{sclerosis}} (PLS) {{is a rare}} idiopathic neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper motor neurons and {{characterized by}} spasticity, muscle weakness, and bulbar involvement. It can sometimes mimic early stage of more common and fatal amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Surgical patients {{with a history of}} neurodegenerative disorders, including PLS, may be at increased risk for general anesthesia related ventilatory depression and postoperative respiratory complications, abnormal response to muscle relaxants, and sensitivity to opioids, sedatives, and local anesthetics. We present a case of a patient with PLS and recent diagnosis of breast cancer who underwent a simple mastectomy surgery uneventfully under an ultrasound guided thoracic paravertebral block, multimodal analgesia, and monitored anesthesia care. Patient reported minimal to no pain or discomfort in the postoperative period and received no opioids for pain management before being discharged home.

Here's a fairly typical case now which I saw last Monday week. A young farmer, a splendid fellow, surprised his fellows by taking a very rosy view of things {{at a time when the}} whole country-side was grumbling. He was going to give up wheat, give up arable land, too, if it didn't pay, plant two thousand acres of rhododendrons and get a monopoly of the supply for Covent Garden--there was no end to his schemes, all sane enough but just a bit inflated. I called at the farm, not to see him, but on an altogether different matter. Something about the man's way of talking struck me and I watched him narrowly. His lip had a trick of quivering, his words slurred themselves together, and so did his handwriting when he had occasion to draw up a small agreement. A closer inspection showed me that one of his pupils was ever so little larger than the other. As I left the house his wife came after me. 'Isn't it splendid to see Job looking so well, doctor,' said she; 'he's that full of energy he can hardly keep himself quiet.'

6000|$|The harder {{industrial}} conditions {{generated by}} woman's irruption {{into a new}} domain of activity produced among laboring men a feeling of blind discontent and concern. Like all men in apprehension, they drew together for mutual protection, they knew not clearly against what. They formed [...] "labor unions," [...] and believed them to be something new and effective in the betterment of their condition; whereas, from the earliest historical times, in Rome, in Greece, in Egypt, in Assyria, labor unions with their accepted methods of [...] "striking" [...] and rioting had been discredited by an almost unbroken record of failure. One of the oldest manuscripts then in existence, preserved in a museum at Turin, but now lost, related how the workmen employed in the necropolis at Thebes, dissatisfied with their allowance of corn and oil, had refused to work, broken out of their quarters and, after much rioting, been subdued by the arrows of the military. And such, despite the sympathies and assistance of brutal mobs of the populace, was sometimes {{the end of the}} American [...] "strike." [...] Originally organized for self-protection, and for a time partly successful, these leagues became great tyrannies, so reasonless in their demands and so unscrupulous in their methods of enforcing them that the laws were unable to deal with them, and frequently the military forces of the several States were ordered out for the protection of life and property; but in most cases the soldiers fraternized with the leagues, ran away, or were easily defeated. The cruel and mindless mobs had always the hypocritical sympathy and encouragement of the newspapers and the politicians, for both feared their power and courted their favor. The judges, dependent for their offices not only on [...] "the labor vote," [...] but, to obtain it, on the approval of the press and the politicians, boldly set aside the laws against conspiracy and strained to the utmost tension those relating to riot, arson and murder. To such a pass did all this come that in the year 1931 an inn-keeper's denial of a half-holiday to an under-cook resulted in the peremptory closing of half the factories in the country, the stoppage of all railroad travel and movement of freight by land and water and a <b>general</b> <b>paralysis</b> of the industries of the land.

5000|$|Inland taipan {{snake venom}} {{contains}} potent presynaptic neurotoxins (toxins in venom that cause paralysis or muscle weakness). Also present are postsynaptic neurotoxins, which are less potent but more rapid acting than the presynaptic neurotoxins. Presynaptic neurotoxins disrupt neurotransmitter {{release from the}} axon terminal. This takes days to resolve and does not respond to antivenom. Postsynaptic neurotoxins competitively block acetylcholine receptors but the effect can be reversed by antivenom. Neurotoxic envenoming causes a progressive descending flaccid paralysis: ptosis is usually the first sign, then facial (dysarthria) and bulbar involvement progressing to dyspnea and respiratory paralysis leading to suffocation and peripheral weakness. [...] Because it can act so fast, it can kill a person within about 45 minutes. There have been reports of people experiencing effects of venom within half an hour as well. The development of <b>general</b> and/or respiratory <b>paralysis</b> is of paramount concern in that these are often difficult to reverse once established, even with large amounts of antivenom. Prolonged intubation and ventilatory support (perhaps {{up to a week}} or longer) may be required. Early diagnosis of neurotoxic symptoms with prompt and adequate dosages of antivenom is critical to avoid these complications.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{sea urchins}} are {{classified}} in the echinoderms category because of their spiny skin. Saponins are the major responsible metabolites for Echinodermata biological activities. As mentioned before, about 80 species of sea urchins are venomous for human. Their spine, pedicellariae, and some other organs such as gonads and coelomic fluids contain different toxins and bioactive compounds. This review study have evaluated toxinology and bioactive compounds from the extracts, and treatment management of these venomous animals. Results: Contractin A, echinochrome A, echinometrin, major yolk protein (MYP), centrocins (I, II(, cathepsin B/X, strongylostatins (I,II), vitellogenin, UT 841 toxin, spinochrome, and pedoxin as the prosthetic group of peditoxin {{are the most important}} compounds obtained from these animals. Some people show poisoning symptoms following the ingestion of sea urchin gonads, especially during the breeding season. Some of these symptoms included allergies symptoms, as the first symptoms, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, epigastric distress, severe headache, swelling of the lips and mouth, salivation, abdominal pain and some systemic symptoms such as hypotension, numbness and weakness. The most injuries by sea urchin can cause by contact to spines, which can create the various complications such as granuloma, synovitis, arthritis, edema, hyperkeratosis and even neuroma. Injuries by pedicellaria may cause severe pain, local edema, bleeding, lethargy, weakness, tingling, joint pain, aphonia, dizziness, syncope, <b>general</b> muscle <b>paralysis,</b> respiratory distress, hypotension and, infrequently death. After the injury by sea urchin, removing the spines and pedicellariae should be done to minimize the contact with the venom source, and subsequently the management of wounds and poisoning symptoms, as quickly as possible. Conclusion: The venoms of some sea urchins have toxins and bioactive molecules that produce toxicity effects on their victims by a variety of mechanisms. Despite the various studies in toxinology field, on these animals, the comprehensive studies that led to the identification of pure toxins from their crude venoms are handful and unfinished and it is important to do further studies on this field, in the future...|$|R

40|$|In {{search of}} the {{neuronal}} substrate for motion analysis in the ferret (Mustela putorius furo), we extracellularly recorded from extra-striate visual cortex in five pigmented and two albino ferrets under <b>general</b> anaesthesia and <b>paralysis.</b> Visual stimulation consisted of large area random dot patterns moving either on a circular path in the frontoparallel plane or expanding and contracting radially. Strongly direction-selective neurons were recorded in a circum-scribed area in and just posterior to the suprasylvian sulcus, thus named by us the posterior suprasylvian area (area PSS). Altogether, we recorded 210 (90 %) and 95 (72 %) PSS neurons in pigmented and albino ferrets, respectively, that were direction selective. In these neurons responses during random dot pattern stimulation in the preferred direction were {{at least twice as}} strong than stimulation in the non-preferred direction. Response strength in preferred direction and tuning sharpness of PSS neurons in albinos were significantly reduced when compared to pigmented animals (median values: 34. 1 versus 14. 8 spikes/s and 142 versus 165 for pigmented and albino ferrets, respectively). Inter-spike-intervals during visual stimulation were significantly shorter in pigmented (median 9 ms) than in albino PSS neurons (median 14 ms).

40|$|The {{symptoms}} of adductor spasmodic dysphonia are most commonly palliated by periodic botulinum toxin injections. The need for repeated injections, difficulty in obtaining injections and cost make {{this form of}} treatment intolerable for some patients. To address these concerns, we propose a new treatment approach utilizing trans-oral recurrent nerve coagulation. The goal is to weaken the force of laryngeal closure during spasms by creating fibrosis of the terminal branches of one recurrent nerve through coagulation. Under <b>general</b> anesthesia without <b>paralysis,</b> an electrical stimulator is used to identify the region within the thyroarytenoid muscle that produces the greatest contraction with minimal stimulation. The radiofrequency laryngeal probe or electrocautery device is introduced into this position, and energy is delivered. The location of the region of maximal stimulation is usually just lateral and anterior to the vocal process of the arytenoids. Between 1989 and 2000, seven patients were treated with electrocautery. To achieve remission of spasms, three patients needed three sessions, four needed two sessions and one only one session. Since 2001, three patients have achieved remission of spasms with a single treatment with radiofrequency during which 80 J was delivered. Voice results are comparable to those obtained with botulinum toxin. Initially, the voice is breathy and laryngeal examination shows complete vocal fold immobility. After 1 - 2 months, the voice improves and examination reveals unilateral hypomobility. Trans-oral recurrent nerve coagulation is an effective alternative to botulinum toxin injections...|$|R

When Churchill asked about the strategic reserve, Gamelin replied that there was none. Churchill then inquired when and where Gamelin proposed to attack the flanks of the bulge. Gamelin replied with a hopeless shrug and the famous words: [...] "Inferiority of numbers, inferiority of equipment, inferiority of method." [...] Six more squadrons were requested for France, above the four additional RAF squadrons which had already that morning been authorised. If the French request were heeded, it would leave just 25 squadrons for home defence, the final limit. Churchill explained that a minimum of 39 fighter squadrons was needed to defend British war industries. Bomber aircraft, he argued, would be better employed attacking the Ruhr; they were unsuitable against tanks. However, the same evening, Churchill warned his War Cabinet that more aircraft should be committed for fear that French resistance would crumble as swiftly {{as that of the}} Poles. French morale was accordingly raised, but matters were not as they seemed. The six extra squadrons were to be based in Kent and would operate from French airfields only during daylight hours. Moreover, three would fly in the mornings and three in the afternoons, and three had already been committed to France as part of Lord Gort's air power. Over the coming three to four days, the strength of the British Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) would be further reduced.|$|R
