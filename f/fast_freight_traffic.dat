5000|$|Prior to German reunification, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for {{a connection between}} the two lines. The Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan (Bundesverkehrswegeplan) of 1992 initially provided for an upgrade of both the Berlin-Dresden and the Dresden-Leipzig railways for high speed. As part of the preliminary design of 1992/1993, it was planned that the line from Leipzig to Dresden would run to the south of Riesa and cross the existing line at Medessen and connect to the route from Berlin at Böhla. After optimisation, the section of new line starting at Riesa was discarded. Instead, there would be now only be the 13 km long section between Böhla and Radebeul on the Berlin-Dresden railway to be upgraded for high speeds and a new link to be built with the Leipzig-Dresden railway. This would allow about 370 million marks to be saved, the effects on nature and landscape would be significantly reduced and fast and slow traffic would be separated. According to information provided by Deutsche Bahn in 2008, the connecting curve would be the most economical solution to segregate long-distance and regional traffic by concentrating long-distance transport on the fast line to the Dresden node, while the slower traffic would remain on the existing line. Furthermore, it would separate long-distance and S-Bahn traffic between Dresden-Neustadt and Coswig. [...] An investigation of the link between the two lines was commissioned on 8 January 1993. In March 1993, the preliminary design for a link between Neumedessen (Leipzig-Dresden railway) and Böhla (Berlin-Dresden railway), including the Kockelsberg Tunnel, was confirmed. With planning expected to be completed in December 1995, it would be possible for the project to be implemented between mid-1998 and early 2000. The project would allow fast and slow traffic to be segregated on its approach to the Dresden railway mode. Since this section of the Berlin-Dresden railway was not used for regional services, it would in future be used only for long-distance passenger and <b>fast</b> <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> In addition, the segregation of traffic would relieve the Coswig railway node of long-distance rail transport and permit the intensification of the regular-interval S-Bahn services to Meissen.|$|E
50|$|The Pacific {{became the}} major express {{passenger}} locomotive type on many railways throughout the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Examples were also built for <b>fast</b> <b>freight</b> and mixed <b>traffic</b> duties. However, {{due to the}} increasing weight of trains during the 1940s, larger developments of the type became necessary in the United States and elsewhere. The most notable of these was the 4-6-4 Hudson or Baltic type, which had a four-wheel trailing bogie that permitted an even larger firebox, albeit at a loss of some adhesive weight, and the 4-8-2 Mountain type which used an extra pair of driving wheels to deliver more tractive effort to the rails. Nevertheless, the Pacific type remained widely used on express passenger trains {{until the end of}} steam traction. The last examples were built in the United Kingdom and Japan in the mid-1950s. British Railways introduced its Standard class 6 and class 7 designs in 1951 and 1952, and the final United Kingdom design, the Standard Class 8, in 1954.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{increase}} in passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> {{in a region}} reflects the development of railways, highways, waterways, aviation, and pipeline. With the growth of economy, China's transportation develops rapidly. However, the passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> present different growth features in different regions. Therefore, a reasonable forecast model for passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> and the analysis of relationship between regional transportation and economy are important for transportation planning. The elasticity coefficient between the passenger <b>traffic</b> volume, <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> volume and gross domestic product (GDP) {{is calculated based on}} the data from 2001 to 2010 in different regions in China. Then, the relationship between the change of regional traffic volume and regional economic development is obtained. With the analysis of the pros and cons for different forecast models, Elasticity Coefficient Method, GM (1, 1) model, and DGM model have been used to forecast passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> volumes from 2011 to 2015. In order to improve the accuracy of the forecast results, the combined models based on the variance reciprocal and the optimal weighting are applied to optimize the forecasting model. Among all the forecast models, the combined model with optimal weights outperforms other models with a relative error less than 0. 006 % for the <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> volume. The accuracy of forecast models on passenger and <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> volume has been improved, which provides a reasonable basis for the planning and development of the transportation system...|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{strategies}} and decisions concerning location, such as outsourcing of individual production processes, {{have an impact}} on the volume of <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> Due to concentration of core competences, new logistics trends, growing importance of services and liberalization of markets, corporate strategies undergo rapid changes. Their spatial impact is of interest, especially when taking into account that new corporate behaviour can increase as well as reduce <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> The overall impact of these changes are very unclear and little empirical evidence is available besides various insights from networks in the automotive sector. For example reducing the level of in-house production may multiply the number of suppliers. They in turn deliver the required parts more frequently but in smaller batches thus increasing the volume of freight transportation. On the other hand the manifest trend towards the concentration and bundling of single suppliers in the form of component or systems suppliers tends to reduce <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> for production inputs. The paper examines two key aspects. First it sheds light on the interrelationships of structural changes of the economy, in particular of corporate behaviour (e. g. outsourcing, just-in-time production, telecommunications) and the volume of <b>freight</b> <b>traffic.</b> Second we will try to answer the following question: in what types of companies does the division of labour along the chain of value added lead to increased <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> and where can <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> be reduced by means of telematics. The paper draws from an empirical study of a region in Central Switzerland. Recommendations for public as well as private actors will deal with potentials to reduce <b>freight</b> <b>traffic</b> through cooperative efforts. ...|$|R
