40|$|International audienceWe {{analyze the}} {{propagation}} properties of low-altitude hiss emission in the ionosphere observed by DEMETER (Detection of Electromagnetic Emissions Transmitted from Earthquake Regions). There exist {{two types of}} low-altitude hiss: type I emission at high latitude is characterized by vertically downward propagation and broadband spectra, while type II emission at low latitude is featured with equatorward propagation and a narrower frequency band above ∼f cH+. Our ray tracing simulation demonstrates that both types of the low-altitude hiss at different latitude are connected and they originate from plasmaspheric hiss and in part chorus emission. Type I emission represents magnetospheric whistler emission that accesses the ionosphere. Equatorward propagation associated with type II emission {{is a consequence of}} wave trapping mechanisms in the ionosphere. Two different wave trapping mechanisms are identified to explain the <b>equatorial</b> <b>propagation</b> of Type II emission; one is associated with the proximity of wave frequency and local proton cyclotron frequency, while the other occurs near the ionospheric density peak...|$|E
40|$|The Intraseasonal Oscillation (ISO; 20 - 120 day) is an {{important}} component of the variability of the Tropical convection that strongly perturbs the Asian and the Aus- tralian monsoons. Our knowledge of the physical origin of the ISO however remains largely incomplete, partially because of the large variability of its characteristics from one event to another. The aim is to determine how the patterns of the different ISO events may be objectively regrouped in a few types, related for example to season, ENSO or other large scale forcing. Patterns of the different ISO events are extracted using a Local Mode Analysis (LMA, Goulet and Duvel 2000). The LMA is based on complex empirical orthogonal functions computed for successive positions of a moving temporal window. When a maximum of variance percentage is detected, the pattern of the corresponding ISO event is extracted. For the present study, the ISO events are detected by an LMA applied on the 20 - 120 -day band pass ﬁltered OLR ﬁeld for a large tropical region (0 ˚- 200 ˚E; 30 ˚N- 30 ˚S) and for the 1979 - 2005 period. The 144 events extracted are then objectively clustered into homogeneous types us- ing a Hierarchical Ascending Classiﬁcation. Our classiﬁcation in 8 types synthetically describes 50 % of the overall diversity of the ISO events. The 8 types depict primarily the seasonality in the ISO modes, with the known north- ward (eastward) propagations over the Indian and Western Paciﬁc basins during the northern summer (winter) seasons. While some similarities are noted from one type to another, important differences conﬁrm however that the ISO may be classiﬁed in more than two types (i. e. the summer and winter types). In particular, some modes are very speciﬁc to particular months (bogus onset in May over the Bay of Bengal, for example). Also, different types are obtained for each season in relation to interannual variability of the sea surface temperature ﬁeld related primarily to ENSO. This study also shows different <b>equatorial</b> <b>propagation</b> characteristics (i. e.

40|$|The {{present study}} offers a {{description}} of long <b>equatorial</b> wave <b>propagation</b> and reflection in the Indian Ocean as observed by the TOPEX/POSEIDON satellite. The equatorial longwave amplitudes are computed from January 1993 until December 1998, focusing on Kelvin (K) and first Rossby (R 1) modes. The K wave is observed to propagate with a baroclinic phase speed close to 2 ?m/s while the R 1 has a phase speed of 0. 7 ?m/s. Wave reflections at both eastern and western boundaries are clearly observed during the entire period. At the eastern boundary K reflects into R 1 with a reflection coefficient of 1. 04 (reflection efficiency of 85 % of that of an infinite meridional wall), and at the western boundary R 1 reflects into K with a coefficient of 0. 50 on average although a large seasonal and interannual variability of the reflection efficiency of the African coast is observed. Reflected K waves strongly influence the R 1 variability near the western boundary as far as 60 °E. Reflected R waves in turn, influence the K variability near the eastern boundary as far as 80 °E. Although long equatorial waves are mainly forced by {{the changes in the}} winds during the inter-monsoon periods, reflection have a strong influence on the ocean's variability over {{a large part of the}} basin on both seasonal and interannual time scales. Focusing on the seasonal cycle of long equatorial waves (computed over 1993 – 1996), it is found that the constructive/destructive interaction between the wind forcing and wave reflection is responsible for the K (or R 1) seasonal cycle to show a semi-annual (or annual) period near the western (or eastern) boundary. In 1994 and 1997 – 98, strong interannual easterlies coincident with El Niño onsets in the Pacific occurred in the Indian Ocean. Long <b>equatorial</b> wave <b>propagation</b> and reflection play a major role in creating an east–west sea level gradient along the equator, suggesting that wave dynamics and wave reflection may play a significant role in the Indian dipole mode suggested by several authors. <br/...|$|R

In order to better highlight the wave propagations, a 25 - 95 day band-pass filter was applied to the sea surface height (SSH) product derived from the TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter and an ocean general circulation model simulation for the 1993 - 2000 period. In addition to <b>equatorial</b> eastward <b>propagations,</b> our analysis reveals recurrent and continuous propagations distinguishable over thousands of kilometers poleward along the coasts as far as about 10 °- 15 ° latitude, a novel result with altimeter data. The variance of the filtered SSH signal goes from 1 cm at the equator to 2 cm at the African coast. Estimates of the phase speed range from 1. 5 to 2. 1 m/s along the equator and the West African coastline. Such values are very close to those of <b>equatorial</b> Kelvin wave <b>propagations,</b> likely dominated by the first two baroclinic modes, supporting the fact that the coastal propagations are coastally trapped Kelvin waves. In order to simplify the description of these Kelvin waves, we present an intraseasonal climatology which reveals regular boreal autumn-winter equator to coast propagations. An improved description is achieved thanks to the computation of an extended empirical orthogonal function for the boreal autumn-winter propagations. Lag correlation of SSH signals allows for a twofold quantification: the phase speed and the importance of remote forcing along the coast. The remote forcing effect of intraseasonal Kelvin waves is clearly evidenced over coastal upwelling regions as far as 10 °- 15 ° latitude.

40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} {{reported}} from Van Allen Probe observations that plasmaspheric hiss intensification in the outer plasmasphere, associated with a substorm injection on 30 September 2012, occurred with a peak frequency near 100 Hz, well below the typical plasmaspheric hiss frequency range, extending down to ∼ 20 Hz. We examine this event of unusually low frequency plasmaspheric hiss to understand its generation mechanism. Quantitative analysis is performed by simulating wave raypaths via the HOTRAY ray tracing code with measured plasma density and calculating raypath-integrated wave gain evaluated using the measured energetic electron distribution. We demonstrate that the growth rate due to substorm-injected electrons is positive but rather weak, leading to small wave gain (∼ 10 dB) during a single <b>equatorial</b> crossing. <b>Propagation</b> characteristics aided by the sharp density gradient associated with the plasmapause, however, can enable these low-frequency waves to undergo cyclic raypaths, which return to the unstable region leading to repeated amplification to yield sufficient net wave gain (3 ̆e 40 dB) to allow waves to grow from the thermal noise...|$|R

Four modes are identified by applying the POP technique. The first mode has a time scale of about 3 months and can be identified with the first baroclinic equatorial Kelvin wave mode. The second mode has a time scale of about six months and describes the semi-annual cycle in tropical Pacific sea level. <b>Equatorial</b> wave <b>propagation</b> is also crucial for this mode.

The results are substantiated by a companion analysis of the sea surface height variability simulated with an oceanic general circulation model (OGCM) forced by observed wind stresses for the period 1961 to 1989. The modal decomposition of the sea level variability is found to be similar to that derived from the GEOSAT data.

In the region between about 88 N and 108 S, the annual adjustment of the thermocline is controlled by both the Ekman pumping and <b>equatorial</b> wave <b>propagation.</b> The local wind stress forcing plays a dominant role in the central North Pacific (38 [...] 88 N, 1708 [...] 1208 W) where the thermocline exhibits the largest amplitude due to the prominent annual variation of the wind stress curl south of the ITCZ. In the equatorial central Pacific (28 N [...] 58 S, 1708 [...] 1208 W), the annual cycle also exhibits a pronounced unimodal seasonal variation (deepest in December and shallowest in May [...] June). This distinctive annual cycle results primarily from the adjustment of the waves, which are excited around 48 N, 1108 W by the annual march of the ITCZ and excited in the equatorial western Pacific by the monsoon flows.

In March 2008, however, Southern peninsular India and Sri Lanka received the largest rainfall anomaly on record since 1979, with amplitude comparable to summer-monsoon interannual anomalies. This anomalous rainfall appeared to be modulated at intraseasonal timescale by the Madden Julian Oscillation, and was synchronous with a decaying La Nia event in the Pacific Ocean. Was this a coincidence or indicative of a teleconnection pattern? In this paper, we explore factors controlling rainfall over southern India and Sri Lanka between January and April, i. e. outside of the southwest and northeast monsoons. This period accounts for 20 % of annual precipitation over Sri Lanka and 10 % over the southern Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Interannual variability is strong (about 40 % of the January-April climatology). Intraseasonal rainfall anomalies over southern India and Sri Lanka are significantly associated with <b>equatorial</b> eastward <b>propagation,</b> characteristic of the Madden Julian Oscillation. At the interannual timescale, we find a clear connection with El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); with El Nios being associated with decreased rainfall (correlation of - 0. 46 significant at the 98 % level). There is also a significant link with local SST anomalies over the Indian Ocean, and in particular with the inter-hemispheric sea surface temperature (SST) gradient over the Indian Ocean (with colder SST south of the equator being conducive to more rainfall, correlation of 0. 55 significant at the 99 % level).

40|$|As part of {{a broader}} effort to develop {{next-generation}} models for numerical weather prediction and climate applications, a hydrostatic atmospheric dynamical core is developed as an intermediate step to evaluate a finite-difference discretization of the primitive equations on spherical icosahedral grids. Based on the need for mass-conserving discretizations for multi-resolution modelling as well as scalability and efficiency on massively parallel computing architectures, the dynamical core is built on triangular C-grids using relatively small discretization stencils. This paper presents the formulation and performance of the baseline version of the new dynamical core, focusing on properties of the numerical solutions in the setting of globally uniform resolution. Theoretical analysis reveals that the discrete divergence operator defined on a single triangular cell using the Gauss theorem is only first-order accurate, and introduces grid-scale noise to the discrete model. The noise can be suppressed by fourth-order hyper-diffusion of the horizontal wind field using a time-step and grid-size-dependent diffusion coefficient, at the expense of stronger damping than in the reference spectral model. A series of idealized tests of different complexity are performed. In the deterministic baroclinic wave test, solutions from the new dynamical core show the expected sensitivity to horizontal resolution, and converge to the reference solution at R 2 B 6 (35 km grid spacing). In a dry climate test, the dynamical core correctly reproduces key features of the meridional heat and momentum transport by baroclinic eddies. In the aqua-planet simulations at 140 km resolution, the new model is able to reproduce the same <b>equatorial</b> wave <b>propagation</b> characteristics as in the reference spectral model, including the sensitivity of such characteristics to the meridional sea surface temperature profile.

The coupled model, driven by solar radiation, reproduces realistic seasonal cycles of the mixed layer temperature, currents, and depth, and the surface winds and rainfall in the tropical Pacific.

Various studies have already provided descriptions of long <b>equatorial</b> wave <b>propagation</b> as well as estimates of their reflection at both the eastern and western boundaries using TOPEX/POSEIDON data over short time periods. In this present work, we are first interested in computing long equatorial wave amplitudes over a much longer period (October 1992 -May 1998) focusing on the Kelvin and first three largest Rossby waves. Secondly, we are examining qualitatively potential theories of ENSO in the light of observations of the strong 1997 - 1998 El Niño event. At the eastern boundary, Kelvin waves are observed to reflect into first (third) mode Rossby waves with a reflection efficiency of 75 % (65 %) of that of an infinite meridional wall. In the western Pacific Ocean, the reflection of the first Rossby wave does explain more than 90 % of the Kelvin wave variance. The second Rossby wave is found not to be correlated to the Kelvin wave amplitude, and the third Rossby wave is highly correlated to the Kelvin signal although its contribution is weak. The investigation during the 1997 - 1998 event of two theories potentially important for ENSO (the delayed action oscillator mechanism and the recent theory of Picaut et al., 1997) led us to the following conclusions. The westerly wind anomalies observed in the western Pacific in December 1996 and March 1997 forced downwelling Kelvin waves which advected {{the eastern edge of the}} warm pool eastward and deepened the thermocline in the east Pacific. Both zonal advection and vertical processes are suggested to act constructively during the onset of positive anomalies in the central and eastern Pacific. From May to September 1997, downwelling Kelvin wave wind-forced in the central Pacific and reflected downwelling Rossby waves (reinforced by local easterly wind anomalies) acted against each other, and the 28 °C isotherm was found to move slightly westward. In October 1997, strong westerly wind anomalies forced a strong downwelling Kelvin wave potentially responsible for the strong warming in the east Pacific. The 28 °C isotherm reached the eastern boundary. At that time, the equatorial sea surface temperatures are zonally homogeneous. The strong downwelling Rossby waves reflected at the boundary could not act to terminate the warm event through zonal advection as suggested by Picaut et al. However the reflected upwelling Kelvin waves coming from the western boundary weakened the downwelling Kelvin signal in the central and east Pacific leading to a decrease of the sea surface temperature anomalies. Following this decrease, westerly wind anomalies in the central Pacific weakened, and upwelling Kelvin waves reinforced by easterly wind anomalies in the western Pacific propagated toward the eastern Pacific. As a conclusion, both theories must be considered simultaneously to understand the variability observed during the 1997 - 1998 El Niño event. However observations strongly suggest the delayed action oscillator mechanism to be the major process at work during the weakening of the warm 1997 - 1998 ENSO...|$|R

On a global scale, {{the development of a}} equatorial anomaly is illustrated with a series of 1995 global TOPEX TEC (total electron content) maps. Locally, in the Australian longitude region, some field-aligned TOPEX TEC cross sections are combined with the matching Guam (144. 86 ° E; 13. 59 ° N, geographic) GPS (Global Positioning System) TEC data, covering the northern crest of the equatorial anomaly. Together, the 1998 TOPEX and GPS TEC data are utilized to show the three main events of vertical E × B drift velocity variations: (1) the pre-reversal enhancement, (2) the reversal and (3) the downward maximum. Their effects on the dual-frequency GPS recordings are documented with the raw Guam GPS TEC data and with the filtered Guam GPS dTEC/min or 1 -min GPS TEC data after Aarons et al. (1997). During these E × B drift velocity events, the Port Moresby (147. 10 ° E; - 9. 40 ° N, geographic) virtual height or h'F ionosonde data (km), which cover the southern crest of the equatorial anomaly in the Australian longitude region, show the effects of plasma drift on the equatorial ionosphere. With the net (D) horizontal (H) magnetic field intensity parameter, introduced and called DH or H equator -H non-equator (nT) by Chandra and Rastogi (1974), the daily E × B drift velocity variations are illustrated at 121 ° E (geographic) in the Australian longitude region. The results obtained with the various data show very clearly that the development of mid-latitude night-time TEC increases is triggered by the westward electric field as the appearance of such night-time TEC increases coincides with the E × B drift velocity reversal. An explanation is offered with the F-region dynamo theory and electrodynamics, and with the ionospheric-plasmaspheric coupling. A comparison is made with the published model results of SUPIM (Sheffield University Plasmasphere-Ionosphere Model; Balan and Bailey, 1995) and experimental results of Park (1971), and the good agreement found is highlighted...|$|R
40|$|With a well-selected data set, {{the various}} {{events of the}} {{vertical}} E × B drift velocity variations at magnetic-equator-latitudes, the resultant ionospheric features at low-and mid-latitudes, and the practical consequences of these E × B events on the <b>equatorial</b> radio signal <b>propagation</b> are demonstrated. On a global scale, {{the development of a}} equatorial anomaly is illustrated with a series of 1995 global TOPEX TEC (total electron content) maps. Locally, in the Australian longitude region, some field-aligned TOPEX TEC cross sections are combined with the matching Guam (144. 86 ° E; 13. 59 ° N, geographic) GPS (Global Positioning System) TEC data, covering the northern crest of the equatorial anomaly. Together, the 1998 TOPEX and GPS TEC data are utilized to show the three main events of vertical E × B drift velocity variations: (1) the pre-reversal enhancement, (2) the reversal and (3) the downward maximum. Their effects on the dual-frequency GPS recordings are documented with the raw Guam GPS TEC data and with the filtered Guam GPS dTEC/min or 1 -min GPS TEC data after Aarons et al. (1997). During these E × B drift velocity events, the Port Moresby (147. 10 ° E; - 9. 40 ° N, geographic) virtual height or h'F ionosonde data (km), which cover the southern crest of the equatorial anomaly in the Australian longitude region, show the effects of plasma drift on the equatorial ionosphere.
