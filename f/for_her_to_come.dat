5|$|Butlin {{remained}} {{close to}} his mother, both in following her to Canada and in arranging <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home {{after the death of}} his stepfather. She died in 1934 and never saw his first holiday camp. By contrast, Butlin makes no mention in his biography of his father after returning from Canada.

5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to run away from home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|In late 1999, Runnels {{arranged}} the Terri Invitational Tournament, a best-of-five series, between Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz, with the winner receiving her managerial {{services and the}} sum of $100,000. The Hardy Boyz won the tournament, which culminated in a ladder match at No Mercy (with the prize money suspended above the ring in a bag). Runnels spent {{the next few months}} as their manager until she was injured when Bubba Ray Dudley powerbombed her through a table. She returned on February 27 at No Way Out and cost the Hardy Boyz a match. She then became the manager of Edge and Christian, and the storyline originally called <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> between the duo, resulting in them becoming singles wrestlers with Runnels managing Christian. The storyline, however, was rewritten, and on an episode of SmackDown!, Edge and Christian—who would now continue wrestling as a tag team—revealed they no longer wanted Runnels's services. She, therefore, slapped Edge, who responded by spearing her.|$|E
