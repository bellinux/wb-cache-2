5|$|In {{response}} to demands for more aircrew to fulfil Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying training underwent {{major changes in}} 1951–52, the syllabus at No.1 FTS being split among three separately located units. No.1 Initial Flying Training School (No.1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.1 IFTS {{went on to the}} newly formed No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) at Uranquinty, where they underwent a further 90 hours of aerial <b>instruction</b> <b>that</b> included instrument, formation and night flying, first on Tiger Moths and then on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.1 FTS, which was renamed No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS) in March 1952. There they undertook 100 flying hours of advanced weapons and combat training on Wirraways, before graduating as sergeant pilots. RAAF College, formed at Point Cook in 1947, was to be the Air Force's primary source of commissioned officers. The Tiger Moths and Wirraways of No.1 BFTS were subsequently replaced by the CAC Winjeel, first delivered in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to demands for more aircrew to meet Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying {{training in the}} RAAF was again expanded in 1951–52, resulting in the functions of No.1 FTS being split among three separately located units. No.1 FTS itself was renamed No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS) in March 1952, and assumed responsibility for advanced weapons and combat training on CAC Wirraways. Meanwhile, in November 1951, No.1 Initial Flying Training School (No.1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve hours on de Havilland Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.1 IFTS went on to another new unit, No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) at RAAF Base Uranquinty, New South Wales, where they underwent further aerial <b>instruction</b> <b>that</b> included instrument, formation and night flying, as well as aerobatics and navigation. The first part of their training at No.1 BFTS included 40 hours on Tiger Moths, after which they would fly 50 hours on Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.1 AFTS, before graduating as sergeant pilots.|$|E
5|$|The first {{training}} courses at No.3 EFTS were not conducted by RAAF instructors {{under the auspices}} of EATS but by Essendon's civil organisations under government contract. The training aircraft were privately owned deHavilland Tiger Moths and Gipsy Moths. All air cadets were subject to RAAF discipline, and the school's training program was directed by Squadron Leader King. The initial intake of sixteen students arrived on 8January 1940, and received eight weeks of <b>instruction</b> <b>that</b> finished on 4March; {{all but one of the}} trainees had prior flying experience, and the course was accident-free. The next student intake at No.3 EFTS arrived on 5February 1940. The school's inaugural EATS course commenced in May. Overall student numbers at this time were reported as being 48, while staff totalled 50. The second EATS course began in July. By this time, Essendon's civilian presence had effectively been absorbed by the military organisation; privately owned aircraft were taken over by the RAAF, which had also begun employing its own aircraft, the first being a Gipsy Moth that arrived in March. Training accidents were frequent, particularly during landings, but did not result in any fatalities.|$|E

Pottle successfully appealed to the jury to disregard the judge's <b>instruction</b> <b>that</b> they consider only whether the defendants were guilty in law, and assert a jury's ancient right to throw out a politically motivated prosecution, in this case compounded by its cynical untimeliness.|$|E
