50|$|Double switching, <b>double</b> <b>cutting,</b> or double {{breaking}} is {{the practice}} of using a multipole switch to close or open both {{the positive and negative}} sides of a DC electrical circuit, or both the hot and neutral sides of an AC circuit. This technique is used to prevent shock hazard in electric devices connected with unpolarised AC power plugs and sockets. Double switching is a crucial safety engineering practice in railway signalling, wherein it is used to ensure that a single false feed of current to a relay is unlikely to cause a wrong side failure. It is an example of using redundancy to increase safety and reduce the likelihood of failure, analogous to double insulation. Double switching increases the cost and complexity of systems in which it is employed, for example by extra relay contacts and extra relays, so the technique is applied selectively where it can provide a cost-effective safety improvement.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the safety, feasibility, {{and effectiveness of}} cutting balloon angioplasty {{in the management of}} infrapopliteal bifurcation disease. METHODS: Between November 2010 and March 2013, 23 patients (mean age 69. 6 ± 9. 01 years, range 56 - 89; 16 men) suffering from critical limb ischemia were treated using cutting balloon angioplasty (single cutting balloon, T-shaped <b>double</b> <b>cutting</b> balloon, or double kissing cutting balloon technique) for 47 infrapopliteal artery bifurcation lesions (16 popliteal bifurcation and 9 tibioperoneal bifurcation) in 25 limbs. Follow-up consisted of clinical examination and duplex ultrasonography at 1 month and every 3 months thereafter. RESULTS: All treatments were technically successful. No 30 -day death or adverse events needing treatment were registered. No flow-limiting dissection was observed, so no stent implantation was necessary. The mean postprocedure minimum lumen diameter and acute gain were 0. 28 ± 0. 04 and 0. 20 ± 0. 06 cm, respectively, with a residual stenosis of 0. 04 ± 0. 02 cm.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} dynamic {{behaviors}} of a rotating shaft {{subjected to the}} <b>double</b> <b>cutting</b> force and time-varying mass effects. The Timoshenko beam theory is used to model the rotating shaft, and the general boundary condition is assumed as the clamped-hinged supports. This system is used to simulate the manufacture process of the double turret CNC lathes, and {{the mass of the}} rod which is reduced gradually in cutting process. The system equations of motion are derived based on the global assumed mode method, and the dynamic responses of the system are obtained by Runge-Kutta numerical method. The transformation matrix is derived to make the equation of motion completing the boundary geometric constraints. The numerical results compare the dynamic response in different moving speeds and skew angles of the cutting forces with/without the time-varying mass effects. Additionally, this paper compares the response with single cutting force and double force. The results show that the double moving force system can reduce not only the machining time but also the amplitude of shaft vibration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the robustness of a plane strain ®nite element model that was developed to simulate plate shearing using the Cockroft±Latham fracture criterion and element deletion. Model predictions for blade gap, ductility and edge wear were compared with published experimental results. Results showed that the model was able to simulate initiation and propagation of fracture lines at the punch and die corners and the resultant break angle along the edge was found to be close to values observed in practice. Simulated edge geometry and microhardness were found to be in reasonable agreement with published experimental results for the steel plate considered although the model was unable to simulate <b>double</b> <b>cutting</b> at 0. 8 per cent clearance. Results also suggest that edge hardness is independent of the starting ductility in the plate and that increasing the edge radii does not eVectively simulate edge wear.

40|$|The {{increase}} of cutting performance of knifes attempt {{to enhance the}} abrasion resistance of the edge, for example with coatings. Nowadays there are sporadic applications using hardened steel knifes for non-shape cutting, which use a coating of Titanium, Chromium or Titanium aluminium nitride. Thereby are friction minimizing and abrasion protection more important than cutting performance enhancement. The paper describes the results of studies with coated knives which use a super hard Diamond Like Carbon coating (DLC). The trials show that the amorphous carbon coating improves the cutting output of hardened knives. The {{research shows that the}} cutting performance of technical knives can be enhanced through coatings. The amorphous hydrogen-free carbon coating obviously improves the cutting output of hardened stainless steel knives. Coated machine-guided paper knives show a <b>double</b> <b>cutting</b> performance compared to uncoated knifes. Furthermore the tests have not been performed to the end so the difference in practice might be higher than the test results in laboratory. By the coated samples the aimed sharpness protecting effect occurs. The protection of one edge side leads to wear on the uncoated side thus minimize the widing of the edge breadth. Therefore the sharpness of th coated knife stays on longer. To achieve such good results it was very important to produce a very adhesive coating. For that reason the pre-treatment of the sample before coating has been adjusted for this special base material. The micro edged geometry and the coating properties have to be adapted for each application. An integrated view which takes all those parameters into consideration fails. Even though the results show that coatings can improve the cutting performance of hardened knives, {{further research is needed to}} understand the adhesion problems of the coatings at the small edge. The behaviour of the coated side is different to the free surfaces because of its unequal properties. The influence of the roughness and the sharping method is not scientifically defined. The effect to the coated side adhesion is not quite clear and subject of further research. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|E

Soil hydro-physical property of forests with density structures of 3600 trees. hm(- 2) in seaward side and 4300 trees. hm(- 2) in landward side were investigated in National Marine Ecology Special Reserve in Changyi City of Shandong Province, in the Bohai-golf of China. The results showed that: 1) There were {{significant difference in the}} indexes, tree height increment and the growth process of diameter with forests two site types. The growth status and its density structure of low density forests were superior to the high density forests in landward side. 2) The skewness (S-K) of diameter distribution had great distinction. The S-k (0. 085) of low density forests approached to normal distribution, and its density structure was reasonable. While the S-k (0. 303) of high density forest in landward side was partial to normal distribution, and its density structure was on the high side. The kurtosis (K) of two forests (one was - 0. 878, the other was - 0. 674) had little distinction and the density factor had little function to forest polarization. 3) The increment of diameter at root height and trunk stock of low density forests increased year after year without effect of density. But the increment of high density forests had declined from since 4 years, which was restricted by high density. 4) Forests of lower density in seaward side, some indexes expressing soil water ecological characteristics, such as soil bulk density, porosity, permeability and soil water-storing capability were much better than that of higher density in landward side, and these indexes of 0 - 20 cm were better than that of 20 - 40 cm. The forests of lower density in seaward side had obvious function of decreasing soil density and increasing soil total porosity. The soil initial infiltration rate, steady infiltration rate and infiltration coefficient of lower density forests in seaward side were times of 1. 31, 1. 60, 1. 52 that of high density forests in landward side, respectively. The capacity of soil saturated water-storing, capillary and non-capillary porosity water-storing of lower density forests in seaward side was significantly larger than that of forests in landward side, increased by 6. 0 %, 2. 8 %, 46. 4 %, respectively, compared with the higher density forests in landward side. 5) According to the growth process and soil hydro-physical properties, the reasonable density of T. chinensis forests about 10 years old was 3600 per hm(2) (it is 240 per 667 m(2)), if the utilization of <b>double</b> <b>cutting</b> was not considered, it is also the reasonable planting density (proposing the space is 2. 0 x 2. 0 m) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} PhD thesis was {{to examine}} kicking and cutting {{maneuver}} tasks between men, women and pubertal amateur soccer players. For this purpose four (4) different studies were conducted. The 1 st study compared instep soccer kicks between men, women and pubertal soccer players. The participants performed three (3) maximum kicks against a stationary soccer ball, while kinematic and kinetic parameters were recorded. Analysis of Variance showed significantly higher ball speed values, ankle linear velocity and angular displacement of the ankle for men compared to women and pubertal players. The vertical ground reaction forces were significantly higher for the pubertal players compared to men and women. The muscular strength differences and the differences of the linear velocity of the ankle seem to resulted in ball speed differences among the examined groups. The 2 nd study compared side-step cutting maneuver tasks between men, women and pubertal soccer players. The participants after a two step approach performed a cutting task at a 45 ? cutting angle. Analysis of variance showed non-significant differences on {{the duration of the}} maneuvers and the knee flexion angle between the examined groups. In contrast, pubertal players demonstrated higher ground reaction forces compared to men and women. The {{results of the present study}} indicated that cutting maneuver tasks are extremely danger situations for knee injury. The pubertal players, however, seems to be in an increased injury potential compared to men and women. The 3 rd study compared straight approach kicking tasks and kicking trials performed after a cutting (faking) maneuver task between men, women and pubertal soccer players. The participants performed five (5) straight approach instep kicks and five (5) kicks after a <b>double</b> <b>cutting</b> maneuver task. The results showed significantly lower ball speed values only for the pubertal players during the kicking tasks after cutting maneuver tasks (Ρ 0. 05). Similarly, ankle, knee and hip linear velocities were not altered after fatigue (Ρ > 0. 05). Only the hip angular displacement of the women was significantly lower after the fatigue protocol. Similarly, the results showed a significantly effect of fatigue only on selected ground reaction forces parameters. In conclusion, the kicking skill is an explosive movement that is well programmed on the central nervous system because of continuous training and seems that is difficult to be altered. The present PhD thesis showed that despite the performance differences regarding the ball speed, the kicking motion did not significantly differ between men and women, between different age levels and after the implementation of a specific fatigue protocol. Moreover, when the kicking motion is combined with another technique skill, such as the cutting maneuver, then the co-ordination demands increases in order better performance to be succeeded. Finally, cutting maneuver tasks seems to increase the load on the knee joint increasing the potential for a knee injury, with pubertal players being in a more danger situation. ...|$|E

Asymmetrical nicking activity is observed as an intermediate of the cleavage reaction. In the intron-containing gene, the enzyme recognizes the downstream intron-exon junction without any cleavage activity.

Here, we sought to apply CRISPR/Cas 9 methods to traditional embryonic stem (ES) cell targeting followed by blastocyst injection to overcome the common issues of difficult vector construction and low targeting efficiency. To facilitate the study of noradrenergic function, which is implicated in myriad behavioral and physiological processes, we generated two different mouse lines that express FLPo recombinase under control of the noradrenergic-specific Dopamine-Beta-Hydroxylase (DBH) gene. We found that by co-electroporating a circular vector expressing Cas 9 and a locus-specific sgRNA, we could target FLPo to the DBH locus in ES cells with shortened 1 kb homology arms. Two different sites in the DBH gene were targeted; the translational start codon with 6 - 8 % targeting efficiency, and the translational stop codon with 75 % targeting efficiency. Using this approach, we established two mouse lines with DBH-specific expression of FLPo in brainstem catecholaminergic populations that are publically available on MMRRC (MMRRC_ 041575 -UCD and MMRRC_ 041577 -UCD).

Due to its relatively low density, silicon {{is an ideal}} optical material for weight sensitive infrared (IR) applications. However, rapid diamond tool edge degradation and {{the effect on the}} achieved surface have prevented significant exploitation. With the aim of developing a process model to optimise the diamond turning of silicon optics, a series of experimental trials were devised using two ultra-precision diamond turning machines. Single crystal silicon specimens (1 1 1) were repeatedly machined using diamond tools of the same specification until the onset of surface brittle fracture. Two cutting fluids were tested. The cutting forces were monitored and the wear morphology of the tool edge was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The most significant result showed the performance of one particular tool was consistently superior when compared with other diamond tools of the same specification. This remarkable tool performance resulted in <b>doubling</b> the <b>cutting</b> distance exhibited by the other diamond tools. Another significant result was associated with coolant type.

At the process of sandstone, if disc cutter spacing as 54 ~ 55 mm, rock crushing as the largest and rock fragmentation efficiency is the highest; with the penetration of 10 mm. If disc cutter spacing as 66 ~ 68. 5 mm, rock crushing as the largest and rock fragmentation efficiency is the highest with the penetration of 15 mm.

In vitro, this function {{does not require the}} N-terminal domain of the enzyme, which is believed to regulate cellular properties. To assess this role, we studied the cellular distribution and mobility of green fluorescent protein-chimera of human topo I lacking either the entire N-terminal domain or a portion of it. We find that topo I truncated up to position 210 is not stabilized by camptothecin in covalent DNA-complexes inside a living cell, whereas in vitro it retains full DNA-relaxation activity, and is targeted by camptothecin in the usual manner. This difference is not shared with a fragment lacking the N-terminal domain up to position 190, indicating that residues 190 – 210 play a crucial role for the activity of the enzyme in its physiological environment, but not in vitro. Since it is impossible to discriminate in vivo whether this region is required for topo I to form covalent DNA intermediates in the cell, or just for camptothecin to bind and stabilize such complexes, we could not explain precisely these cellular observations. However, inactivity in vivo of the enzyme lacking this region is indicated by a lesser cytotoxicity...|$|R

40|$|Insect {{herbivory}} {{can affect}} morphology and physiological functions of plants. Defoliation caused by herbivores may alter photosynthetic rates of remaining plant tissues or reduce the leaf area {{and limit the}} photosynthate needed to fulfill the energy and nutritional requirements of the plants. The reduction in plant leaf area may reduce {{the quality and quantity}} of biomass, which is critical for bioenergy crops. Plants may also compensate for herbivory losses utilizing their energy and resulting in less vigorous plants. ^ Two switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) cultivars, Shawnee (upland) and Kanlow (lowland), were evaluated for yield response to simulated leaf-mass consumption. The data showed no significant effect of up to 80 % simulated insect defoliation on the yield of switchgrass under suitable weather conditions. During the first year of the study with abundant rainfall, a significant reduction in leaf area index (LAI) did not result in a significant effect on switchgrass yield. However, the following year, drought occurred and resulted in significant yield reduction, along with reductions in LAI and percent light interception. ^ Switchgrass cultivars (Shawnee and Kanlow) were tested for their photosynthetic response to simulated leaf injury. Mechanical defoliation with different insect feeding patterns was applied to individual leaves to determine the effect on photosynthetic rates. No significant differences among various patterns of tissue removal were recorded in Kanlow. However, during 2011, <b>double</b> edge <b>cutting</b> treatment significantly reduced the photosynthetic rates in Shawnee. Significant reductions in photosynthetic rates were recorded over time in Kanlow for both years. Photosynthetic rates differed significantly between the years even prior to treatment, likely as a result of water stress in the second year. ^ The actual feeding rates of nymphs and adults of red-legged grasshopper, Melanoplus femurrubrum (DeGeer) (Orthoptera: Acrididae) were quantified. The average leaf area consumed and the weight gained by each stage of grasshopper were measured after three days of feeding. The results of the study indicated that the third instar of M. femurrubrum consumed the maximum amount per unit of body weight per day while the maximum weight gain was observed in adults and the fifth instars. These results may explain the higher metabolic rates and digestive efficiencies of early instar grasshoppers. The study results suggest control of grasshoppers at early stages is needed to avoid potential economic losses. ...|$|R

The effect of sowing media on germination of Gymnema seeds has been investigated using four kinds of sowing media; sand, coir dust, a mixture of top soil and sand (1 : 1) and a mixture of sand top soil and coir dust (1 : 1 : 1). Seeds were stored in an open system under room temperature (30 °C) and germination percentage was recorded at 15 -day intervals. This was to find out the effect of storage period on germination of seeds. Complete Randomized Design was used for the experiments with five replicates, each contained ten seeds.

Hard wood, semi-hard wood and soft wood cuttings were planted in polybags filled with a mixture of sand, top soil and compost (1 : 1 : 1), to determine the effect of maturity of cuttings on rooting. Effect of watering on rooting of cuttings was investigated using semi-hard wood cuttings planted in polybags contained a potting mixture of sand, top soil and compost (l: 1 : 1) with three watering frequencies. Complete Randomized Design was used for the studies with ten replicates. Number of roots, root length and root biomass accumulation were measured at the end of 6, 10 and 14 weeks after planting. Results showed that germination percentage of seeds was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) high (92 %) in coir dust, whereas the lowest germination percentage (28 %) was observed from top soil media. There were no significant (p ≤ 0. 05) differences in germination of seeds throughout the first two months of storage under normal condition. Results of the vegetative propagation studies revealed that a mixture of sand, top soil and compost (1 : 1 : 1) was the most suitable rooting media for Gymnema cuttings, whereas the semi-hard wood cuttings rooted significantly (p ≤ 0. 05) higher than the hard wood and soft wood cuttings. With regard to the watering frequency, cuttings watered once in two days rooted and performed significantly (p≤ 0. 05) better than the other treatments. Results can be concluded that Gymnema sylvestre can be propagated by means of both sexual and asexual methods. Semi-hard wood cuttings, which appear to be more amenable to rooting and potting mixture of sand, top soil, and compost watered once in two days, showed the best results, while high germination percentage of seeds could be obtained within first two months of storage...|$|R
