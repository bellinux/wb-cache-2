[...] " [...] one {{of those}} rare {{instances}} where none can review it, or talk about it, without mentioning the cameraman, art director, and score composer in the same breath as the actors and director." [...] Variety also praised the cast, writing that [...] "Karloff manages to invest the character with some subtleties of emotion that are surprisingly real and touching... Thesiger as Dr Pretorious [...] a diabolic characterization if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one...</b> Lanchester handles two assignments, being first in a preamble as author Mary Shelley and then the created woman. In latter assignment she impresses quite highly." ...|$|E
2500|$|After facing several club-level opponents, the International Boxing Club {{guaranteed}} Louis $300,000 to face undefeated heavyweight contender Rocky Marciano on October 26, 1951. Despite {{his being}} a 6-to-5 favorite, few boxing insiders believed Louis had a chance. Marciano himself {{was reluctant to}} participate in the bout, but was understanding of Louis's position: [...] "This is the last guy on earth I want to fight." [...] It was feared, particularly among those who had witnessed Marciano's punching power first-hand, that Louis's unwillingness to quit would result in serious injury. Fighting back tears, Ferdie Pacheco said in the SportsCentury documentary about his bout with Marciano, [...] "He [...] wasn't just going to lose. He was going to take a vicious, savage beating. Before the eyes of the nation, Joe Louis, an American hero if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one,</b> was going to get beaten up." [...] Louis was dropped in the eighth round by a Marciano left and knocked through the ropes and out of the ring less than thirty seconds later.|$|E
2500|$|Another lauded {{performance}} {{was that of}} Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret, whose role is usually heavily cut, and often eliminated entirely from both 1 Henry VI and, especially, Richard III. Margaret is the only character to appear in all four plays (unless one counts the Ghost of Henry VI in Richard III), and Ashcroft relished the chance to develop the character over the entire production, arguing that Margaret is [...] "a Dark Lady if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> - and prototype for Cressida, Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth - was Shakespeare's first [...] "heroine" [...] - if such she can be called [...] It takes four plays to make her {{one of the great}} female characters in Shakespeare - and the full-length portrait has been seen only in The Wars of the Roses cycle - but she has facets that are not touched on in any other." [...] Ashcroft saw the scene from 2 Henry VI where she appears on-stage carrying the head of her lover, the Duke of Suffolk, as pivotal to both the character's development and her own understanding of Margaret; [...] "I came to realise why this scene was of paramount importance - for later in what {{is one of the greatest}} and certainly most horrific scenes [...] when Margaret wipes the blood of York's son on the Duke's face [...] I found that seemingly impossible bestial act to be credible as the result of the violence that has been perpetrated on her lover." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1914 {{collection}} by Frank Thomas Bullen, Songs of Sea Labour, {{differed from}} the work of writers such as Masefield in having a more practical, rather than romantic, tone. Bullen, an Englishman, was an experienced shantyman, who sailed during the heyday of shanties to ports in the Southern U.S. and the Caribbean. He took a firm stance that only true work songs should be included in his collection, thus resisting the temptation to let shanties slide into the genres of ballads or other off-duty songs. (Pressure of his publisher forced him to include two sea songs, clearly demarcated, {{at the end of the}} book.) And rather than shape the shanties to appear as narrative pieces, he noted that, since most shanties would usually be improvised, it would be disingenuous to present more than one or two sample verses. As for his framing of the genre's origins, Bullen stated his belief that, [...] "he great majority of these tunes undoubtably emanated from the negroes of the Antilles and the Southern states, a most tuneful race if <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one,</b> men moreover who seemed unable to pick up a ropeyarn without a song…" [...] And Bullen's musicologist editor, Arnold, claimed, [...] "he majority of the Chanties are Negroid in origin…" [...] Bullen's insistence on including only true work songs in the collection meant that he likely omitted songs—generally those for heaving tasks, like capstan work—which had been easily borrowed from the land-based traditions of various nations. The effect of including only the most exclusively work-oriented songs meant that a higher percentage of African-American songs were represented.|$|E
