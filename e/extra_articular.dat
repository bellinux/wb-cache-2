40|$|Background: The {{presence}} of <b>extra</b> <b>articular</b> deformities {{either in the}} femur or the tibia with arthritis of the knee makes total knee arthroplasty (TKA) technically demanding. The {{purpose of this study}} is to report outcomes with Total Knee Arthroplasty in patients with arthritis of the knee associated with <b>extra</b> <b>articular</b> deformity by intraarticular resection and soft tissue balancing. Materials and Methods: Thirty six knees (32 patients) who had arthritis of the knee associated with <b>extra</b> <b>articular</b> deformity, underwent total knee arthroplasty between 1999 and 2006 were included in this retrospective analysis. All patients had intraarticular resection with soft tissue balancing to correct the deformity. Full length weight bearing anteroposterior X-rays, Knee society scores, and Knee range of motion was recorded pre- and postoperatively. Results: The mean period of followup was 85 months (range 42 - 120 months). The deformities amenable to correction by intraarticular resection in our series were Femur- Coronal plane 11 °- 18 ° (mean 16. 2 °) Saggital plane 0 °- 15 ° (mean 10. 1 °) Tibia - Coronal plane 12 °- 24 ° (mean 21 °). There was an improvement in the range of motion from mean of 54 ° preoperatively to 114 ° postoperatively (P value < 0. 05). The Knee Society- Knee Score improved from 37 points to 85 points postoperatively (P value < 0. 05). The functional score improved from a mean value of 19 to a mean of 69. 5 at followup (P < 0. 01).

Methods To evaluate the results and long term effects in use of this plate we performed a retrospective analysis with a mean follow up of 65 months (5. 4 years) of 28 consecutive patients with acute displaced lateral clavicle fractures, treated with the clavicle hook plate. Results Short term functional results in all patients were good to excellent. All but one patient had a united fracture (96 %). Nine patients (32 %) developed impingement symptoms and in 7 patients (25 %) subacromial osteolysis was found. These findings resolved after plate removal. Twenty-four patients were re-evaluated at a mean follow-up period of 5. 4 years. The Constant-Murley score was 97 and the DASH score was 3. 5. Four patients (14 %) developed acromioclavicular joint arthrosis of which one was symptomatic. Three patients (11 %) had <b>extra</b> <b>articular</b> ossifications of which one was symptomatic.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been recognised as a complication of RA but its potential for mortality and morbidity has arguably been under appreciated for decades. New studies have underscored a significant lifetime risk of ILD development in RA.

30|$|Various {{modalities}} {{of treatment}} for distal radius fracture are described in the literature and the four methods generally followed in treating these fractures are, one conservative treatment in plaster cast with or without manipulative reduction; two, percutaneous K wire fixation to maintain reduction while in plaster; three, External fixation (bridging or non-bridging); four, open reduction and internal fixation. There is no general consensus regarding the indications, {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each of these treatment methods [7]. Percutaneous pin fixation is an excellent technique provided distal aspect of radius is not severely comminuted or osteoporotic. It is especially useful for unstable fractures both <b>extra</b> <b>articular</b> and intra articular sometimes in combination with other modes of fixation [1]. This technique was first reported by Stein and Katz [8] and further refined by Clancey [9]. K wires are placed through radial styloid and/or dorsally to aid in reduction. Alternatively they may be placed intrafocally as in Kapandji’s technique [10]. Cross pinning with two radial styloid pins and placement of a pin from the ulnar corner of the radius is described to be the most rigid construct biomechanically [11]. Secondary displacement after K wire fixation is explained by residual instability due to fracture comminution or osteoporosis. Correlation between anatomical and functional results is yet another controversial topic in treatment of these fractures. Most authors consider loss of radial length (ulnar variance) as the most crucial radiological parameter that influences the functional outcome [5, 12].|$|E

Anemia wasobserved in 20 patients (64. 5 %), out of the 20 patients, 12 patients (60 %) were found to be havinganemia of chronic disease(ACD) and 8 patients (40 %) were found to be having iron deficiency anemia(IDA). In anemic group, the mean DAS 28 &MHAQ were found to be 6. 85 + 0. 64 & 1. 41 + 0. 44 respectively& in the non anemic group mean DAS 28 &MHAQ were found to be 4. 76 + 1. 29 & 0. 7 + 0. 25 respectively. It is concluded that anemia is a common <b>extra</b> <b>articular</b> manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis and anemiaof chronic disease is the commonest type of anemia in rheumatoid arthritis. Anemic patients tend to havesevere disease as reflected by high disease activity score and MHAQ scores...|$|E
40|$|Background: Poor {{results of}} the {{fractures}} could be result of {{the intervention of the}} bone setters. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze functional outcome of the patients intervened initially by a bonesetter. Methods: 179 outpatients with distal radius fractures treated at emergency department of regional hospital of Durres from January 2014 to December 2014 were studied, divided in two groups; presented direct to the hospital (H) and intervened initially by a bonesetter (B). All patient demographics and social data were studied. Anatomic and functional {{results of the}} patient were estimated. Results: 179 patients, 114 (63. 9 %) females with mean age 53. 9 years. 115 (64. 2 %) lived in a rural area. 118 (65. 9 %) of patients came direct to hospital and 61 (34. 1 %) were intervened initially by a bonesetter. The mean time of the patients being present to emergency was 1. 78 +/- 0. 8 for group H and 23. 6 +/- 13. 1 for group B. The majority of the fractures are <b>extra</b> <b>articular</b> 108 (60. 3 %). We had excellent anatomic results in 16 (8. 9 %), good in 39 (21. 8 %), fair in 60 (33. 5 %) and poor in 64 (35. 8 %). Mean QuickDASH Scores for group H was 50 +/- 23 and 80 +/- 13 for group B, (p< 0. 001). Conclusions: Poor functional results come from the distal radius fractures intervened initially by bonesetters. Patients education and dissemination of information about the trauma, trauma system and complication coming from inadequate treatment, will be effective in prevention of complications regarding bonesetter interventions.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{evaluate}} {{the frequency of}} four serum biomarkers in RA patients and their relatives and identify possible associations with clinical findings of the disease. Design and methodsThis was a transversal analytical study. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin (anti-MCV) and IgA-rheumatoid factor (RF) were determined by ELISA and IgM-RF by latex agglutination in 210 RA patients, 198 relatives and 92 healthy controls from Southern Brazil. Clinical and demographic data were obtained through charts review and questionnaires. ResultsA higher positivity for all antibodies was observed in RA patients when compared to relatives and controls (p< 0. 0001). IgA-RF was more frequent in relatives compared to controls (14. 6 % vs. 5. 4 %, p= 0. 03, OR= 2. 98; 95 % CI= 1. 11 – 7. 98) whereas anti-CCP {{was the most common}} biomarker among RA patients (75. 6 %). Concomitant positivity for the four biomarkers was more common in patients (46. 2 %, p< 0. 0001). Relatives and controls were mostly positive for just one biomarker (20. 2 %, p< 0. 0001 and 15. 2 %, p= 0. 016, respectively). No association was observed between the number of positive biomarkers and age of disease onset, functional class or tobacco exposure. In seronegative patients predominate absence of <b>extra</b> <b>articular</b> manifestations (EAMs) (p= 0. 01; OR= 3. 25; 95 % CI= 1. 16 – 10. 66). Arthralgia was present in positive relatives, regardless the type of biomarker. ConclusionsA higher number of biomarkers was present in RA patients with EAMs. Positivity of biomarkers was related to arthralgia in relatives. These findings reinforce the link between distinct biomarkers and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of AR...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Data {{on outcome}} of ERA is scarce {{and there is}} lack of well-accepted tools. JADI is a newly {{described}} outcome measure in JIA {{that has not been}} evaluated in ERA. We studied outcome in ERA using JADI and correlated it with traditional outcome measures. Methods We studied 49 consecutive patients of ERA with age ≥ 5 years and duration ≥ 1 year. Along with JADI, we recorded enthesitis, lumbar spinal anterior flexion by modified Schober's method, presence of inflammatory backache, loss of school years, HAQ-S, growth and pubertal delay. Parent's/patient's and physician's global assessments on 100 mm visual analogue scale. Results The median age was 18. 0 (10 – 27) years and the median duration of disease was 6. 0 (1 – 17) years. All the patients were male and half (53. 1 %) were HLA B 27 positive. Fourteen had decreased anterior lumbar flexion movement and 32 had inflammatory backache. Active enthesitis was present in 63. 3 %. Functionally, mild, moderate and severe disability was seen in 18. 4 %, 34. 7 % & 14. 3 % respectively. Sixty five percent of patients lost education years. Twenty-eight patients had damaged joints with median of 2. 0 joints (0 – 9). Seventeen patients (34. 7 %) had damaged joints in JADI-A score with a median of 1. 0 (0 – 12). Growth failure was the commonest <b>extra</b> <b>articular</b> damage (8. 2 %) in JADI-E. JADI correlated with HAQ-S, parent's or patient's & physician's global assessment (p Conclusion Three fourth of the ERA patients had functional limitations. Half of the patients had damaged joints. Even though JADI correlated well with traditional outcome measures, it underestimates joint damage, and does not assess enthesitis and spinal limitation which affect functional status in ERA. Inclusion of these may make it more useful for ERA. </p...|$|E
