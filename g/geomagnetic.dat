5|$|Although {{generally}} Earth's {{field is}} approximately dipolar, with an axis that is nearly {{aligned with the}} rotational axis, occasionally the North and South <b>geomagnetic</b> poles trade places. Evidence for these <b>geomagnetic</b> reversals {{can be found in}} basalts, sediment cores taken from the ocean floors, and seafloor magnetic anomalies. Reversals occur nearly randomly in time, with intervals between reversals ranging from less than 0.1 million years to as much as 50 million years. The most recent <b>geomagnetic</b> reversal, called the Brunhes–Matuyama reversal, occurred about 780,000 years ago. A related phenomenon, a <b>geomagnetic</b> excursion, amounts to an incomplete reversal, with no change in polarity. The Laschamp event is an example of an excursion, it having occurred during the last ice age (41,000 years ago).|$|E
5|$|Activities {{conducted}} by Russia's Novolazarevskaya Station include environmental monitoring, geodesy/mapping, <b>geomagnetic</b> and meteorological observations, glaciology, biology, ionosphericauroral observations, limnology, geology, geophysics and seismology.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the overall}} <b>geomagnetic</b> field is {{becoming}} weaker; the present strong deterioration {{corresponds to a}} 10–15% decline over the last 150 years and has accelerated {{in the past several}} years; <b>geomagnetic</b> intensity has declined almost continuously from a maximum 35% above the modern value achieved approximately 2,000 years ago. The rate of decrease and the current strength are within the normal range of variation, as shown by the record of past magnetic fields recorded in rocks.|$|E
5|$|The International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy {{maintains}} a standard global field model called the International <b>Geomagnetic</b> Reference Field. It is updated every 5 years. The 11th-generation model, IGRF11, was developed {{using data from}} satellites (Ørsted, CHAMP and SAC-C) and a world network of <b>geomagnetic</b> observatories. The spherical harmonic expansion was truncated at degree 10, with 120 coefficients, until 2000. Subsequent models are truncated at degree 13 (195 coefficients).|$|E
5|$|The International Real-time Magnetic Observatory Network, {{with over}} 100 {{interlinked}} <b>geomagnetic</b> observatories {{around the world}} has been recording the earths magnetic field since 1991.|$|E
5|$|The <b>geomagnetic</b> field {{changes on}} time scales from {{milliseconds}} {{to millions of}} years. Shorter time scales mostly arise from currents in the ionosphere (ionospheric dynamo region) and magnetosphere, and some changes {{can be traced to}} <b>geomagnetic</b> storms or daily variations in currents. Changes over time scales of a year or more mostly reflect changes in the Earth's interior, particularly the iron-rich core.|$|E
5|$|Changes that predate {{magnetic}} observatories {{are recorded}} in archaeological and geological materials. Such changes {{are referred to}} as paleomagnetic secular variation or paleosecular variation (PSV). The records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting <b>geomagnetic</b> excursions and reversals.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field, {{also known}} as the <b>geomagnetic</b> field, is the magnetic field that extends from the Earth's interior out into space, where it meets the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. Its magnitude at the Earth's surface ranges from 25 to 65microteslas (0.25 to 0.65gauss). Roughly speaking it is the field of a magnetic dipole currently tilted at an angle of about 11 degrees with respect to Earth's rotational axis, as if there were a bar magnet placed at that angle {{at the center of the}} Earth. The North <b>geomagnetic</b> pole, located near Greenland in the northern hemisphere, is actually the south pole of the Earth's magnetic field, and the South <b>geomagnetic</b> pole is the north pole. Unlike a bar magnet, Earth's magnetic field changes over time because it is generated by a geodynamo (in Earth's case, the motion of molten iron alloys in its outer core).|$|E
5|$|Frequently, the Earth's {{magnetosphere}} is hit by solar flares causing <b>geomagnetic</b> storms, provoking {{displays of}} aurorae. The short-term instability {{of the magnetic}} field is measured with the K-index.|$|E
5|$|Geospace is {{populated}} by electrically charged particles {{at very low}} densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. During <b>geomagnetic</b> storms two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere, can become strongly disturbed. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, disrupting telecommunications and GPS technologies, and {{can also be a}} hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the <b>geomagnetic</b> poles.|$|E
5|$|The global {{definition}} of the Earth's field {{is based on a}} mathematical model. If a line is drawn {{through the center of the}} Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South <b>geomagnetic</b> poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the <b>geomagnetic</b> poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point towards them. However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.|$|E
5|$|While the North and South {{magnetic}} poles are usually {{located near the}} geographic poles, they can wander widely over geological time scales, but sufficiently slowly for ordinary compasses to remain useful for navigation. However, at irregular intervals averaging several hundred thousand years, the Earth's field reverses and the North and South Magnetic Poles relatively abruptly switch places. These reversals of the <b>geomagnetic</b> poles leave a record in rocks that are of value to paleomagnetists in calculating <b>geomagnetic</b> fields in the past. Such information in turn is helpful in studying the motions of continents and ocean floors {{in the process of}} plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{sometimes}} operate {{units that}} specialize in measurement of the Earth's magnetic field. These are <b>geomagnetic</b> observatories, typically {{part of a national}} Geological survey, for example the British Geological Survey's Eskdalemuir Observatory. Such observatories can measure and forecast magnetic conditions such as magnetic storms that sometimes affect communications, electric power, and other human activities.|$|E
5|$|Radiometric dating of {{lava flows}} {{has been used}} to {{establish}} a <b>geomagnetic</b> polarity time scale, part of which is shown in the image. This forms the basis of magnetostratigraphy, a geophysical correlation technique {{that can be used to}} date both sedimentary and volcanic sequences as well as the seafloor magnetic anomalies.|$|E
5|$|The first self-consistent dynamo models, {{ones that}} {{determine}} both the fluid motions and the magnetic field, {{were developed by}} two groups in 1995, one in Japan {{and one in the}} United States. The latter received attention because it successfully reproduced some of the characteristics of the Earth's field, including <b>geomagnetic</b> reversals.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} determines local <b>geomagnetic</b> field characteristics, {{in order}} to detect anomalies in the natural background that might {{be caused by a}} significant metallic object such as a submerged submarine. Typically, these magnetic anomaly detectors are flown in aircraft like the UK's Nimrod or towed as an instrument or an array of instruments from surface ships.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the <b>geomagnetic</b> fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for hours on a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This <b>geomagnetic</b> storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
5|$|Another idea tied to 2012 {{involved}} a <b>geomagnetic</b> reversal (often incorrectly {{referred to as}} a pole shift by proponents), possibly triggered by a massive solar flare, that would release an energy equal to 100billion atomic bombs. This belief was supposedly supported by observations that the Earth's magnetic field was weakening, which could precede a reversal of the north and south magnetic poles, and the arrival of the next solar maximum, which was expected sometime around 2012.|$|E
5|$|At 2:44 am EST on March 13, 1989, {{a severe}} <b>geomagnetic</b> storm, {{due to a}} coronal mass {{ejection}} from the Sun, struck Earth. Fluctuations within the magnetic field of the storm caused geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow through Quebec's power lines, which are direct current, instead of the alternating current carried by the power lines. The insulating nature of the Canadian Shield igneous rock directed the GICs to the power lines. The conductors then forwarded this current to sensitive electrical transformers, which require a certain voltage amplitude and frequency to function properly. Although most GICs are relatively feeble, the nature of those currents destabilized the voltage of the power grid and current spikes erupted everywhere.|$|E
5|$|Earth {{has evolved}} through {{geological}} and biological processes that have left {{traces of the}} original conditions. The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates. The interior remains active, with {{a thick layer of}} plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field. This iron core is composed of a solid inner phase, and a fluid outer phase. Convective motion in the core generates electric currents through dynamo action, and these, in turn, generate the <b>geomagnetic</b> field.|$|E
5|$|Lieder {{described}} Planet X as roughly {{four times}} the size of the Earth, and said that its closest approach would occur on May 27, 2003, resulting in the Earth's rotation ceasing for exactly 5.9 terrestrial days. This would be followed by the Earth's pole destabilising in a pole shift (a physical pole shift, with the Earth's pole physically moving, rather than a <b>geomagnetic</b> reversal) caused by magnetic attraction between the Earth's core and the magnetism of the passing planet. This in turn would disrupt the Earth's magnetic core and lead to subsequent displacement of the Earth's crust.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is roughly equivalent to a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the <b>geomagnetic</b> North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
5|$|On {{a mission}} on P4X-639, a planet {{experiencing}} strong solar activity, the SG-1 team encounters an alien archaeologist named Malikai (Robin Mossley). When a <b>geomagnetic</b> disturbance hits its peak, the Stargate activates simultaneously {{on the planet}} and on Earth, and a flash strikes Malikai, Colonel O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) near an Ancient altar. Moments later, O'Neill finds himself in the Stargate Command (SGC) cafeteria {{in the middle of}} a breakfast conversation with Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Major Carter (Amanda Tapping), who claim to have no knowledge of the planet. O'Neill and Teal'c later express familiarity with the events, and they are checked and certified to be in perfect health. Before SG-1 can resume their planned mission to the planet, an unscheduled offworld activation of the Earth Stargate, accompanied by flashes, transports O'Neill back to breakfast.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons {{of the solar}} wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail. Because the velocity of the solar wind {{is greater than the}} speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bowshock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates; the ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the <b>geomagnetic</b> field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belt are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but otherwise contained by the magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|The A- and K-indices are a {{measurement}} {{of the behavior of}} the horizontal component of the <b>geomagnetic</b> field. The K-index uses a scale from 0 to 9 to measure the change in the horizontal component of the <b>geomagnetic</b> field. A new K-index is determined at the Boulder <b>Geomagnetic</b> Observatory.|$|E
25|$|Auroras are {{occasionally}} seen in latitudes {{below the}} auroral zone, when a <b>geomagnetic</b> storm temporarily enlarges the auroral oval. Large <b>geomagnetic</b> storms are most common {{during the peak}} of the eleven-year sunspot cycle or during the three years after the peak.|$|E
25|$|A <b>geomagnetic</b> {{storm is}} a {{temporary}} intense disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|There {{should also}} be {{secondary}} markers (other fossils, chemical, <b>geomagnetic</b> reversal).|$|E
25|$|<b>Geomagnetic</b> {{storms that}} ignite auroras may occur more often {{during the months}} around the equinoxes. It is not well understood, but <b>geomagnetic</b> storms may vary with Earth's seasons. Two factors to {{consider}} are the tilt of both the solar and Earth's axis to the ecliptic plane. As the Earth orbits throughout a year, it experiences an interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) from different latitudes of the Sun, which is tilted at 8 degrees. Similarly, the 23 degree tilt of the Earth's axis about which the <b>geomagnetic</b> pole rotates with a diurnal variation, changes the daily average angle that the <b>geomagnetic</b> field presents to the incident IMF throughout a year. These factors combined can lead to minor cyclical changes in the detailed way that the IMF links to the magnetosphere. In turn, this affects the average probability of opening a door through which energy from the solar wind can reach the Earth's inner magnetosphere and thereby enhance auroras.|$|E
25|$|During a <b>geomagnetic</b> {{storm the}} F₂ layer will become unstable, fragment, {{and may even}} {{disappear}} completely.|$|E
25|$|Space weather exerts a {{profound}} influence {{in several areas}} related to space exploration and development. Changing <b>geomagnetic</b> conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing the rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in Low Earth orbit. <b>Geomagnetic</b> storms due to increased solar activity can potentially blind sensors aboard spacecraft, or interfere with on-board electronics. An understanding of space environmental conditions is also important in designing shielding and life support systems for manned spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|Skywave {{propagation}} {{is usually}} degraded—sometimes seriously—during <b>geomagnetic</b> storms. Skywave propagation on the sunlit {{side of the}} Earth can be entirely disrupted during sudden ionospheric disturbances.|$|E
25|$|Most auroras {{occur in}} a band known as the auroral zone, which is {{typically}} 3° to 6° wide in latitude and between 10° and 20° from the <b>geomagnetic</b> poles at all local times (or longitudes), most clearly seen at night against a dark sky. A region that currently displays an aurora is called the auroral oval, a band displaced towards the nightside of the Earth. Early evidence for a <b>geomagnetic</b> connection comes from the statistics of auroral observations. Elias Loomis (1860), and later Hermann Fritz (1881) and S. Tromholt (1882) in more detail, established that the aurora appeared mainly in the auroral zone. Day-to-day positions of the auroral ovals are posted on the internet.|$|E
25|$|Following {{laboratory}} tests of molten iron, European scientists {{determine that the}} Earth's core has a temperature of 6,000 degrees Celsius, 1,000 degrees hotter than previously thought. This discovery {{may help explain why}} the planet has such a strong <b>geomagnetic</b> field.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, all of Quebec {{and parts}} of New England and New Brunswick lost power because of an {{equipment}} failure at a substation on the North Shore. The March 1989 <b>geomagnetic</b> storm tripped circuit breakers on the transmission network causing a nine-hour Quebec-wide blackout.|$|E
