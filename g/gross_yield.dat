25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the <b>gross</b> {{redemption}} <b>yield.</b> This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the <b>gross</b> redemption <b>yield</b> (<b>gross</b> means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a <b>gross</b> redemption <b>yield</b> of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a <b>gross</b> redemption <b>yield</b> of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|R

The agreeable selling price is intrinsically defined to be at or less than the appraised value allowing the process to be attainable. A prudent buyer will not pay greater than the appraised value, and a Bank or Finance company will not provide a mortgage for greater than the appraised value, thus limiting the Short Sale proceeds to a maximum <b>gross</b> <b>yield</b> of the property's Appraised Value.|$|E

50|$|The {{interest}} effect {{derives from}} the fact that if the foreign tax rate is low, the tax rate effect on the net yield is growing with time as the amount of additional interest increases exponentially (interest advantage). Therefore, given equal <b>gross</b> <b>yields,</b> e.g. regarding mobile financial assets, it is more profitable to invest in low-tax countries: The net yield is higher in a low-tax country than in a high-tax country and hence the capital grows at a faster rate. That interest effect cannot be wholly eliminated, even if there is additional taxation upon distribution (e.g. like in a shareholder relief system or with the credit method).|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} and main features of bank bonds held by Italian households and presents {{an estimate of}} the <b>gross</b> <b>yield</b> to maturity of the bonds purchased at issue. Since 1950 the share of these assets in households' portfolios has shown wide fluctuations, primarily reflecting the issuance policies of banks and changes in the tax treatment of securities, as well as changes in preferences. The share of bonds in the financial wealth of households reached a peak of 11 percent in 1973 and 2011. Since 2012 investment in bonds has started to decrease: by March 2016 the share of bank bonds in the financial wealth of households had returned to below 5 percent. The <b>gross</b> <b>yield</b> at issue of bank bonds placed with Italian households increased during the sovereign debt crisis but has now fallen back to the levels reached in the years preceding 2011.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} money market fund (MMF) risks and outcomes during crises, {{with a focus on}} the ABCP crisis in 2007 and the run on money funds in 2008. I analyze three broad types of MMF risks: portfolio risks arising from a fund's assets, investor risk reflecting the likelihood that a fund's shareholders will redeem shares disruptively, and sponsor risk due to uncertainty about MMF sponsors' support for distressed funds. I find that during the run on MMFs in September and October 2008, outflows were larger for MMFs that had previously exhibited greater degrees of all three types of risk. In contrast, as the asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) crisis unfolded in 2007, many MMFs suffered capital losses, but investor flows were relatively unresponsive to risks, probably because investors correctly believed that sponsors would absorb the losses. However, the consequences of MMF risks were quite costly for some sponsors: Using a unique data set of sponsor interventions, I show that sponsor financial support was more likely for MMFs that previously earned higher <b>gross</b> <b>yields</b> (a measure of portfolio risk) and funds with bank-affiliated sponsors. Funds' <b>gross</b> <b>yields</b> and bank affiliation (but not funds' ratings) also would have helped forecast holdings of distressed ABCP. This paper provides some useful lessons for investors and policymakers. The significance of MMF risks in predicting poor outcomes in past crises highlights the importance of monitoring such risks, and I offer some useful proxies for doing so. The paper also argues for greater attention to the systemic risks posed by the industry's reliance on discretionary sponsor support. Money market funds; Mutual funds; Asset-backed financing...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{whether or not}} investors behave rationally when they price the U. S. office properties. After reviewing several previous studies on the market efficiency, this paper makes three new attempts: first, we employs the actual information on transactions and rents at the property level to resolve the substitution problems; second, we introduce another pricing method which use gross yields and typical cap rate method; lastly, Shiller Test with those actual data is conducted to determine whether future rental growth can be predicted by both or either of those two pricing methods. The major empirical results can be summarized into the two findings: 1) in the pricing models, the <b>gross</b> <b>yield</b> reflects a property's future rental growth, whereas the cap rate is mostly correlated to the relatively short-term rental growth in the past, 2) in Shiller Test, the future rental growth of a property can be forecasted by the <b>gross</b> <b>yield,</b> not by the cap rate. These findings suggest that although not perfect, investors of the US office properties, at least partially, forecast the future income of the investments, and reflect them into the pricings by means of gross yields rather than cap rates. by Jinbae Jeong.
