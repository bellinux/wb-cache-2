50|$|However, new Federal Housing Administration short refinance options {{implemented}} {{earlier this}} month {{make it easier for}} a borrower to short refinance their home. These new guidelines were developed to help borrowers with negative equity. The new guidelines were developed to help borrowers who defaulted on their loans through no fault of their own. The new modifications give more flexibility to mortgage servicers (the person you contact <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> your mortgage loan account)as well as to the originators to help unemployed homeowners. These changes are being funded with $50 billion allocated to housing programs by the Troubled Asset Relief Program. These programs were developed to help responsible homeowners, such as those who continually made their payments on time, to avoid foreclosure. The current mortgage servicers of borrowers' home loans are under no government requirements to entertain a short payoff refinance which is why most borrowers find it is beneficial to hire a mortgage broker that employs specialized negotiators {{to take care of the}} short negotiating for the Borrowers. Once an agreement has been reached, a new FHA lender will be required to refinance the loan.|$|E
