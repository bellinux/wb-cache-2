In Study 1, participants {{with a strong}} propensity to consciously monitor and control their movements, determined psychometrically by high scores on a movement specific Reinvestment Scale, displayed more alpha 2 T 3 -Fz co-activation than participants with a weak propensity. In Study 2, participants who practiced a <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> task implicitly (via an errorless learning protocol) displayed less alpha 2 T 3 -Fz co-activation than those who practiced explicitly (by errorful learning). In addition, explicit but not implicit motor learners displayed more T 3 -Fz co-activation during <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> under pressure, implying that verbal-analytical processing of putting movements increased under pressure.

40|$|Avhandling (doktorgrad) – Norges idrettshøgskole, 2010. Putting, which {{accounts}} for about 40 - 45 % of shots in elite golf, is a complex skill. To perform in putting an elite player needs to master green reading, putter aim and technique. Mental skills, equipment and strategy may also affect performance. Although several research papers have been published {{on the subject of}} putting, only a few focus specifically on putting performance. The aim of the thesis is to investigate different factors affecting performance in <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> for elite players, and to compare the importance of those factors.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} a modified conceptualization of imagery direction and its subsequent effects on <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> performance. A progression in the directional imagery literature {{was made by}} {{eliminating the need for}} participants to intentionally create persuasively harmful images as they rarely occur, if at all, in the sporting domain. Thus, we explored a more ecologically valid conceptualization of debilitative imagery and measured the effects on sports performance (<b>golf</b> <b>putting).</b> Seventy five participants were randomly allocated to one of three conditions: (a) facilitative imagery, (b) suppressive imagery (debilitative), or (c) no-imagery control. After performing imagery, the facilitative imagery group successfully putted significantly more golf balls than the suppressive imagery group. This finding suggests that a non-persuasive conceptualization of debilitative imagery can result in disparate effects on performance compared to facilitative imagery. In doing so, this adds ecological strength to the imagery direction literature by suggesting debilitative imagery need not be persuasive to influence motor skill performance. © 2008 West Virginia University...|$|R

40|$|Witt et al. (2008) have {{recently}} shown that golfers who putt with more success perceive the hole {{to be bigger}} than golfers who putt with less success. In three experiments, we systematically examined whether this phenomenon, labelled action-specific perception, depends on directing visual attention towards the action target. In Experiment 1 we replicated previously reported action-specific effects on perception in <b>golf</b> <b>putting.</b> In Experiments 2 and 3 we directly assessed whether action-specific effects on perception in <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> are dependent on focusing visual attention on the target. To this end, the participants performed the putting task while visual attention towards the target was either completely withheld (Experiment 2) or divided over the target and other task-relevant objects (Experiment 3). No action-specific effects were found when visual attention towards the action target was occluded or partially diverted from the target. Together, our results provide {{evidence to suggest that}} focusing visual attention on the target while performing the action is a prerequisite for the emergence of action-specific perception. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{measurement of}} a <b>putting</b> <b>golf</b> ball jump motion using a vision sensor. After <b>putting,</b> a <b>golf</b> ball experiences bouncing, sliding and rolling sequentially. In particular, ball jump motion contains lots of important {{information related to}} impact such as jump number, height and length. Putting is simulated as a simple pendulum and golf ball jumps are measured using a vision sensor. The golf ball jump changes significantly according to impact errors such as impact timings. If an IMU sensor is attached on the putter head and relationship between variations of golf ball trajectory and IMU sensor signal is characterized, coaching information of <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> to correct various impact errors can be provided only using IMU sensor...|$|R
40|$|Two studies {{examined}} {{whether the}} number of errors made in learning a motor skill, <b>golf</b> <b>putting,</b> differentially influences the adoption of a selective (explicit) or unselective (implicit) learning mode. Errorful learners were expected to adopt an explicit, hypothesis-testing strategy to correct errors during learning, thereby accruing a pool of verbalizable rules and exhibiting performance breakdown under dual-task conditions, characteristic of a selective mode of learning. Reducing errors during learning was predicted to minimize the involvement of explicit hypothesis testing leading to the adoption of an unselective mode of learning, distinguished by few verbalizable rules and robust performance under secondary task loading. Both studies supported these predictions. The <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> performance of errorless learners in both studies was unaffected by the imposition of a secondary task load, whereas the performance of errorful learners deteriorated. Reducing errors during learning limited {{the number of}} error-correcting hypotheses tested by the learner, thereby reducing the contribution of explicit processing to skill acquisition. It was concluded that the reduction of errors during learning encourages the use of implicit, unselective learning processes, which confer insusceptibility to performance breakdown under distraction. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{in this study}} was to investigate if self-reported handicaps and behavioral self-handicapping are influenced by perceptions of the motivational climate. Our secondary objective was to investigate if self-handicapping strategies (self-reported and behavioral handicaps) are influenced by performance. We observed 22 (9 female and 13 male) elite junior golfers (mean hcp. = 4. 18) in a <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> task. Participants completed a putting exercise twice, the first time doing it as a competition, and subsequently doing it as a putting exercise to improve putting skills. Behavioral self-handicapping (measured by four specific behavioral cues for <b>golf</b> <b>putting)</b> was analyzed through video footage of the two conditions. Subsequent to completing both conditions, participants were given the opportunity to self-report handicaps. Results revealed that self-handicapping was not influenced by perceptions of the motivational climate. However, a negative relationship between putting performance and self- handicapping was found. Further, the standard multiple analysis revealed that performance was a significant (negative) predictor for self-reported handicaps, and also for one of the four behavioral self-handicapping cues. The findings suggest that reporting handicaps after a poor performance is a self-handicapping strategy to enhance our private self-esteem and self-image.

40|$|Nowadays PGA golfers {{are experimenting}} with various <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> grips. The {{purpose of this study}} was to {{investigate}} the traits of using two putting grips; reverse overlapping grip and finger bone grip at three different putting distances. 20 subjects with no previous golf experience participated in this study. The kinematic data of the subject and the putter’s shaft and head was recorded by 8 Qualisys cameras at 100 Hz. There was no significant difference between the success rate of getting the ball in the hole at all distances. The finger bone grip produced statistically smaller radial error values than the reverse overlapping grip at the distances for 7 and 11 metres. The finger bone grip provided straighter putter head trajectories and less change in the movement of the COG, which implies more stability of the player and that the ball will travel in the desired path. In conclusion, the finger bone putting technique gave radial errors less than the reverse overlapping grip technique which seems to be due to the added stability and straighter putter head trajectories.

40|$|Objectives Instructions {{to avoid}} an action may {{increase}} the tendency {{to engage in the}} action (ironic effects) or cause an undesirable increase in the opposing action (overcompensation). The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the relationship between gaze behavior and performance in a <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> task when these kinds of unwanted effects occur. Methods Twenty-seven participants performed an indoor <b>golf</b> <b>putting</b> task with instructions to land the ball on the hole (neutral instructions), land the ball on the hole but avoid putting too short and land the ball on the hole but avoid putting too long. Order of instruction was randomized and both gaze behavior and putting performance were assessed. Results When participants gazed for longer at a specific area (in front, behind or at the hole) the ball was more likely to land in that area. Subsequent analyses confirmed a tight relationship between gaze behavior and putting performance when overcompensation occurred. For ironic effects such a tight relationship was only found when participants were instructed to avoid putting too short, but not when participants were instructed to avoid putting too long.

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis Group in European Journal of Sport Science on 25 / 08 / 2015, available online: [URL] aim {{of the study was}} to explore the significance of the 'timing' of the quiet eye (QE), and the relative importance of late (online control) or early (pre-programming) visual information for accuracy. Twenty-seven skilled golfers completed a putting task using an occlusion paradigm with three conditions: early (prior to backswing), late (during putter stroke), and no (control) occlusion of vision. Performance, QE, and kinematic variables relating to the swing were measured. Results revealed that providing only early visual information (occluding late visual information) had a significant detrimental effect on performance and kinematic measures, compared to the control condition (no occlusion), despite QE durations being maintained. Conversely, providing only late visual information (occluding early visual information) was not significantly detrimental to performance or kinematics, with results similar to those in the control condition. These findings imply that the visual information extracted during movement execution - the late proportion of the QE - is critical when <b>golf</b> <b>putting.</b> The results challenge the predominant view that the QE serves only a pre-programming function. We propose that the different proportions of the QE (before and during movement) may serve different functions in supporting accuracy in <b>golf</b> <b>putting...</b>|$|R
