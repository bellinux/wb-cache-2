5|$|Some {{men still}} use bathhouses as a convenient, {{safe place to}} meet other men for sex. In areas where <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> more accepted, safety {{may no longer be}} a primary attraction.|$|E
5|$|Many bathhouses {{are open}} {{twenty-four hours a}} day, seven days a week. There is {{typically}} a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry {{to those who are}} visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.|$|E
5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. <b>Homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E
50|$|<b>Homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> legalized in 1858 in {{all parts}} of Ottoman Empire, so Bulgaria as part of it legalized it too. After the Liberation of Bulgaria, <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> recriminalized.|$|R
50|$|Another {{characteristic}} of the DSM-II systemization was that it classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. Thus, <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> psychiatrically defined a pathological deviation from 'normal' sexual development. <b>Homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> later replaced in the 7th printing of DSM-II, instead categorized as a 'Sexual orientation disturbance'. The intent {{was to have a}} label that applied only to those homosexual individuals who were bothered by their sexual orientation. In this manner <b>homosexuality</b> would not <b>be</b> viewed as an atypical illness. Only if it <b>was</b> distressing would <b>homosexuality</b> <b>be</b> classified as a mental illness. However, the DMS-II did not explicitly state that any <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> normal either. This stigma lasted into DSM-III until it was reformed entirely from DSM classifications in 1987.|$|R
50|$|In the Helvetic (1798-1803), {{marked by}} {{the values of the}} Enlightenment and the French Revolution, <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> not prosecuted. With the end of the Helvetic Republic, <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> made an {{official}} offence in most Cantons, and penalised with up to several years imprisonment.|$|R
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed sodomy. He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, sodomy was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia's {{legal system}} {{is based on}} English Common Law. Although the {{judiciary}} is theoretically independent, its independence has been called into question and the appointment of judges lacks accountability and transparency. The highest court in the judicial system is the Federal Court, followed by the Court of Appeal and two high courts, one for Peninsular Malaysia and one for East Malaysia. Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against royalty. The death penalty is in use for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping. Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts are the Syariah Courts, which apply Shariah law to Muslims {{in the areas of}} family law and religious observances. <b>Homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> illegal in Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|The {{identities of}} several of the men were {{obscured}} in some fashion, either in shadow or, in one instance, behind a large potted palm tree. Also interviewed were psychiatrist Charles Socarides, who strongly advocated the position that <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> a mental disorder, and fellow psychiatrist Irving Bieber, who shared Socarides' opinion of homosexuality as pathology. Interspersed with these interview segments was footage, described as being in the cinéma vérité style, of the inside of a gay bar along with shots of hustlers working a street corner and a teenager being arrested in a public sex sting.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> removed as {{a mental}} {{disorder}} from the DSM-II, the diagnostic manual {{published by the}} American Psychiatric Association, {{the most widely used}} diagnostic manual worldwide. [...] Ego-dystonic <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> retained as a diagnosis for those who are caused distress by their sexual orientation.|$|R

5|$|In 2004, Eve's vengeful, adoptive sister, Liz Sanbourne, discovers Irma's existence, {{and brings}} her to Harmony to destroy Eve's life by {{revealing}} her past to her family. Irma tells them Eve {{was once a}} prostitute and drug addict while living in Boston, and {{was involved in a}} relationship with Julian, who is T.C.'s sworn enemy. The revelations destroy Eve and T.C.'s marriage. Despite her Christian upbringing, Irma is often foul-mouthed; she frequently calls Eve a whore or a slut. When Eve's daughter Simone tells Irma she is a lesbian, Irma, who has previously been kind to her, tells Simone <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> vile and disgusting, and orders her to leave and never return. Irma was portrayed by actress Marla Gibbs on a recurring basis in 2004 and 2005. Gibbs viewed Irma as a malicious character, and was surprised at fans' positive feedback.|$|E
5|$|Spanish bishops {{also claimed}} that the Government, by {{extending}} the right of marriage to same-sex couples, weakened the meaning of marriage, which they defined as an involving a heterosexual couple. The Spanish Family Forum expressed concern over the possibility of same-sex couples adopting and raising children, and argued that adoption is not a right for the parents, but for the adopted. Gay associations replied that de facto adoption by same-sex couples had existed {{for a long time}} in Spain, since many couples were rearing minors adopted by one of the partners. Adoption by same-sex couples was already legal in Navarre (2000), the Basque Country (2003), Aragon (2004), Catalonia (2005) and Cantabria (2005) before the same-sex marriage law legalized these adoptions nationwide. Furthermore, in Asturias (2002), Andalusia (2002) and Extremadura (2003), same-sex couples could jointly begin procedures to temporarily or permanently take children in care. These associations also argued that there was no scientific basis for the claim that the parents' sexual orientation would cause developmental problems for their adopted children. This view is officially supported by the Spanish School of Psychology, which also states that <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> not a pathology.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{values have}} endured the attempt by western {{institutions}} {{to impose a}} positive image of deviant behavior. For instance, {{in spite of the}} removal of homosexuality from the nomenclature of mental disorders, 62.5% of 450 surveyed psychiatrists in the Rostov Region view it as an illness, and up to three quarters view it as immoral behavior. The psychiatrists sustain the ban on gay parades and the use of veiled schemes to lay off openly lesbian and gay persons from schools, child care centers, and other public institutions. The chief psychiatrist of Russia Zurab Kekelidze in his 2013 interview to Dozhd says that a part of the cases of <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> a mental disorder, he counters the remark that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the list of mental disorders by stating that it is not true. Homosexuality, which is a mental disorder, was continuously defined as such by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia in 2005 when its president Savenko expressed their joint surprise at the proposal by the Executive Committee of the American Psychiatric Association to exclude homosexuality as a mental disorder from manuals on psychiatry due to political pressure from western NGOs and governments, referred the proposal to antipsychiatric actions, and stated that ideological, social and liberal reasoning for the proposal was substituted for scientific one. In 2014, Savenko changed his mind about homosexuality, and he along with Alexei Perekhov succumb to pressure and, in their joint paper criticized and referred the trend to consider homosexuality as a mental disorder to Soviet mentality.|$|E

50|$|During the Partitions of Poland (1795-1918) laws prohibiting <b>homosexuality</b> <b>were</b> {{imposed by}} the occupying powers. <b>Homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> {{recognized}} by law in 1932 {{with the introduction of}} a new penal code. The age of consent was set to 15, equal to that of heterosexual partners. Homosexual prostitution was legalized in 1969.|$|R

25|$|<b>Homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> also {{frequently}} considered sinful in Islam. In some Middle Eastern countries, acts of <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> punishable by death. The only country that recognizes same sex {{relationships in the}} Middle East is Israel, although <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> legal in a few other countries. Along with Israel, same-sex sexual activities have been legal in the Palestinian territories (West Bank) since 1951. Homosexuality between women, however, is legal in more Islamic countries than homosexuality between men.|$|E

5000|$|It {{was due to}} Spitzers {{efforts that}} <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> no longer part of the 1974 DSM-II: [...] "By {{withdrawing}} it from the manual, <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> legitimized as a normal difference rather than a psychiatric behavior. This early powerful statement by institutional psychiatry that this is normal sped up the confidence {{of people in the}} movement." ...|$|R
25|$|During the {{earliest}} parts of psychoanalytic history, analysts granted that <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> non-pathological in certain cases, and the ethical {{question of whether}} it ought to be changed was discussed. By the 1920s analysts assumed that <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> pathological and that attempts to treat it were appropriate, although psychoanalytic opinion about changing <b>homosexuality</b> <b>was</b> largely pessimistic. Those forms of <b>homosexuality</b> that <b>were</b> considered perversions were usually held to be uncurable. Analysts' tolerant statements about homosexuality arose from recognition of the difficulty of achieving change. Beginning in the 1930s and continuing for roughly twenty years, major changes occurred in how analysts viewed homosexuality, which involved a shift in the rhetoric of analysts, some of whom felt free to ridicule and abuse their gay patients.|$|R
25|$|South Korea's still {{continuing}} traditionalist beliefs {{result in}} few people being open about their homosexuality. <b>Homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> discouraged, although <b>homosexuality</b> <b>is</b> legal in South Korea. As a result, {{there are few}} if any legal protections in place for gays and lesbians, {{and many of them}} are afraid to come out to their families, friends, and co-workers. Gay men are not allowed to serve in the military, and in 2005 five soldiers were discharged for homosexuality.|$|E
