5|$|On the field, {{the band}} is led by three drum majors and the twelve members of bugle rank. Each drum major carries a mace and directs the band based on its {{movements}} and whistle commands during a drill. The <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> major is a Cadet Lieutenant Colonel, while the two side drum majors, the Infantry Band Drum Major and the Artillery Band Drum Major, are Cadet Majors.|$|E
25|$|All student {{leaders are}} {{determined}} by a voting process by the band. However, the section leader(s) for the drumline {{as well as the}} <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> major are chosen by the directors partially based on the suggestions of the students.|$|E
25|$|The band {{consists}} of 228 musicians. The block band seen at every game {{consists of}} 192 members, while halftime shows consist of 195 members. The other 36 members are alternates. These {{are members of}} the band who challenge the regular members every week for a spot in the gameday block. The alternates also understudy the week’s halftime show with the squad leader in case someone gets sick or injured before the performance. Alternates have a chance to perform with the regular band members during performances of Double Script Ohio, as well as during pre-game shows on away game trips. All music is memorized and verified during music checks each Friday. On game day the alternates help move equipment around if the show has props or a pit, otherwise they are led by the assistant drum major and stand at attention (minus instruments) on the sideline near {{the south end of the}} field. The band block consists of lettered rows ABCEFHIJKLMQRSTX and D. D row consists of one <b>Head</b> <b>Drum</b> Major, one Assistant Drum Major (who is the assistant to the <b>Head</b> <b>Drum</b> Major), and D-Row members who train and learn under the drum major in order to one day try out for the position.|$|E
25|$|The <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> has {{the most}} effect on how a drum sounds. Each type of <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> serves its own musical purpose and has its own unique sound. Double-ply drumheads dampen high {{frequency}} harmonics because they are heavier and they are suited to heavy playing. <b>Drum</b> <b>heads</b> with a white, textured coating on them muffle the overtones of the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> slightly, producing a less diverse pitch. <b>Drum</b> <b>heads</b> with central silver or black dots tend to muffle the overtones even more. And <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> with perimeter sound rings mostly eliminate overtones (Howie 2005). Some jazz drummers avoid using thick <b>drum</b> <b>heads,</b> preferring single ply <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> or <b>drum</b> <b>heads</b> with no muffling. Rock drummers often prefer the thicker or coated <b>drum</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R

25|$|Most bands {{meet in the}} summer, {{normally}} in August for summer training, or prior to the specific marching season (known as band camp). This involves learning basic marching fundamentals such as the type of marching step the band uses, commands from the drum major, and how to move on field. The band is also given music to learn for their show. Drill for the show {{may or may not}} be provided to learn during band camp. The camp takes place outdoors on field for marching, and in a band hall for music-only rehearsals. Sectionals, or rehearsals including all of one instrument (e.g. flute sectional), take place during this time. Directors may use time during band camp to place band members in their sections based on playing and/or marching level and ability. This time can also be used for the potential drums majors to showcase their abilities and for the band director to choose who is <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> major. For bands that require auditions for the band, drumline, or auxiliary, auditions may happen the first few days for placement. Band camp usually lasts 1–2 weeks, but in the case of a more advanced marching band, camp may last up to a month. In most university bands, band camp means an earlier move-in date for university students in the band.|$|E
500|$|Garza {{was born}} in 1934. Her parents, Nicolas and Josefina, owned a dry {{cleaning}} business in McAllen, a city in Hidalgo County {{and part of the}} South Texas border region known as the Rio Grande Valley. By the time Garza was a teenager, her parents' business had become successful and the family was able to move from the south side of McAllen to a more affluent area {{on the north side of}} the city. She was a graduate of McAllen High School. White students made up a majority at the school, and Garza was the first Latina to become a twirler or <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> majorette. She was crowned the 1958 Miss All South Texas Sweetheart and was a homecoming queen at Pan American College.|$|E
500|$|The halftime drill always {{begins with}} the band running into place at the command of the drum major's whistle. The {{announcer}} (Lieutenant Colonel Jay Brewer) then states, usually in unison with the crowd, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, now forming {{at the north end}} of Kyle Field, the nationally famous Fightin' Texas Aggie Band." [...] A whoop and cheers come from the audience. The drum majors then march out in front of the band and the <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> major calls the band to attention and vocally gives directions to the band, referencing the composition of the Aggie War Hymn, by shouting, [...] "Recall! Step off on Hullabaloo!" [...] (Recall is a traditional Army bugle call – the first 34 notes, and intro of the Aggie War Hymn. [...] "Hullabaloo" [...] is the first word sung in the Aggie War Hymn.) These directions are not amplified in any way, but can be heard across the entire stadium. After another whoop, the drum majors signal for the horns to be lifted into playing position with two quick whistle blasts and the bugle rank does a flourish.|$|E

50|$|The {{circular}} <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> {{is made of}} processed cow skin. Usually {{there are}} 12 hinges that hold the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> to the wooden trunk using thick ropes. Typical <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> size is about 32 cm and about 23 cm inner diameter. Playing area of <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> is about 20 cm in diameter. Wedges inserted inside the ropes are twisted to tighten or loosen the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> while tuning. A tubular wooden wedge is tied to edge of the <b>drum</b> <b>head</b> to roll using dominant hand. Traditionally the chande must be tuned to an octave above singers tonic (Higher Shadja).|$|R

[...] This is called [...] "Flushing the field" [...] or [...] "Flushing the Indian Head", derived from the sections nickname [...] "Flush".|$|E
2500|$|Irishman Patrick S. Gilmore {{started the}} concept of a band leader. [...] A marching band is {{typically}} led by one to three or, occasionally, four drum majors, also called field commanders, who are responsible for conducting the band (sometimes using a large baton or mace, though such tools are used rarely in modern marching bands for conducting) and commonly referred to {{as the leader of the}} band. [...] When there is more than one drum major, one may be the <b>head</b> <b>drum</b> major, who stands on the 50-yard line while conducting, whereas the other(s) often directs from convenient angles (should the marching block not be facing forward) and/or functions as an apprentice of sorts. The number of members in the band often determines how many drum majors are needed, based on the complexity of the show (in which case, in a three-person scenario, one stands on the 50-yard line while another stands on the 30-yard line and the third stands on the other 30-yard line), and occasionally, additional individuals may be asked to perform brief conducting duties if beneficial in a particularly tricky part of the show (more often, such people are those on the sidelines or in the pit). [...] The modern-day concept of the Drum Major has been exponentially expanded upon by George N. Parks, often known as the [...] "Dynamic Drum Major," [...] through his Drum Major Academy. Bands may also be led by a more traditional conductor, especially during field shows, where a stationary conductor on a ladder or platform may be visible throughout the performance. [...] Aural commands—such as vocal orders, clapping, or a whistle—may be used to issue commands as well. In show bands, particularly in HBCU and Big Ten bands, drum majors often have a visual on-field role with a baton or mace, with the job of conducting relegated to the director(s). In these cases, the number of drum majors is often based on tradition, rather than being in proportion with the number of musicians. For example, the Florida A Marching 100 fields one drum major for each president in the university's history. [...] Other leaders within the band may include field lieutenants and captains of sections such as brass, drumline, and woodwinds, and members that lead a section, squad, letter, row, etc.|$|E
