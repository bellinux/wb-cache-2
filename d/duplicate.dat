The competition was held outdoors on a half-sized court during the special Inside the NBA show prior to the All-Star Saturday Night events. The objective of this competition is to accrue as few of the five letters as possible. A player is given a letter every time they fail to <b>duplicate</b> the shot of another player. Each player was given 24 seconds to make or <b>duplicate</b> the shot (dunking was prohibited). Each player who fails to <b>duplicate</b> five shots was eliminated from the competition. An NBA referee was assigned to rule whether the shot was done properly.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Artificial <b>duplicates</b> from {{pyrosequencing}} reads {{may lead}} to incorrect interpretation of the abundance of species and genes in metagenomic studies. <b>Duplicated</b> reads were filtered out in many metagenomic projects. However, since the <b>duplicated</b> reads observed in a pyrosequencing run also include natural (non-artificial) <b>duplicates,</b> simply removing all <b>duplicates</b> may also cause underestimation of abundance associated with natural <b>duplicates.</b> Results We implemented a method for identification of exact and nearly identical <b>duplicates</b> from pyrosequencing reads. This method performs an all-against-all sequence comparison and clusters the <b>duplicates</b> into groups using an algorithm modified from our previous sequence clustering method cd-hit. This method can process a typical dataset in ~ 10 minutes; it also provides a consensus sequence for each group of <b>duplicates.</b> We applied this method to the underlying raw reads of 39 genomic projects and 10 metagenomic projects that utilized pyrosequencing technique. We compared the occurrences of the <b>duplicates</b> identified by our method and the natural <b>duplicates</b> made by independent simulations. We observed that the <b>duplicates,</b> including both artificial and natural <b>duplicates,</b> make up 4 - 44 % of reads. The number of natural <b>duplicates</b> highly correlates with the samples' read density (number of reads divided by genome size). For high-complexity metagenomic samples lacking dominant species, natural <b>duplicates</b> only make up Conclusions Our method is available from [URL] as a downloadable program and a web server. It is important not only to identify the <b>duplicates</b> from metagenomic datasets but also to distinguish whether they are artificial or natural <b>duplicates.</b> We provide a tool to estimate the number of natural <b>duplicates</b> according to user-defined sample types, so users can decide whether to retain or remove <b>duplicates</b> in their projects. </p...|$|R

40|$|Different {{modes of}} gene {{duplication}} including whole-genome duplication (WGD), and tandem, proximal and dispersed duplications are widespread in angiosperm genomes. Small-scale, stochastic gene relocations and transposed gene duplications are widely accepted {{to be the}} primary mechanisms for the creation of dispersed <b>duplicates.</b> However, here we show that most surviving ancient dispersed <b>duplicates</b> in core eudicots originated from large-scale gene relocations within a narrow window of time following a genome triplication (γ) event that occurred in the stem lineage of core eudicots. We name these surviving ancient dispersed <b>duplicates</b> as relocated γ <b>duplicates.</b> In Arabidopsis thaliana, relocated γ, WGD and single-gene <b>duplicates</b> have distinct features with regard to gene functions, essentiality, and protein interactions. Relative to γ <b>duplicates,</b> relocated γ <b>duplicates</b> have higher non-synonymous substitution rates, but comparable levels of expression and regulation divergence. Thus, relocated γ <b>duplicates</b> should be distinguished from WGD and single-gene <b>duplicates</b> for evolutionary investigations. Our results suggest large-scale gene relocations following the γ event were associated with the diversification of core eudicots...|$|R

5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in <b>duplicate.</b> If the result of either <b>duplicate</b> test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E

40|$|Background: There {{has been}} a surge in studies linking genome {{structure}} and gene expression, with special focus on <b>duplicated</b> genes. Although initially <b>duplicated</b> from the same sequence, <b>duplicated</b> genes can diverge strongly over evolution and take on different functions or regulated expression. However, information on the function and expression of <b>duplicated</b> genes remains sparse. Identifying groups of <b>duplicated</b> genes in different genomes and characterizing their expression and function would therefore be {{of great interest to}} the research community. The ‘Duplicated Genes Database’ (DGD) was developed for this purpose. [br/] Methodology: Nine species were included in the DGD. For each species, BLAST analyses were conducted on peptide sequences corresponding to the genes mapped on a same chromosome. Groups of <b>duplicated</b> genes were defined based on these pairwise BLAST comparisons and the genomic location of the genes. For each group, Pearson correlations between gene expression data and semantic similarities between functional GO annotations were also computed when the relevant information was available. [br/] Conclusions: The <b>Duplicated</b> Gene Database provides a list of co-localised and <b>duplicated</b> genes for several species with the available gene co-expression level and semantic similarity value of functional annotation. Adding these data to the groups of <b>duplicated</b> genes provides biological information that can prove useful to gene expression analyses. The <b>Duplicated</b> Gene Database can be freely accessed through the DGD website at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} coalescent-based {{simulation}} tool to generate patterns of {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNPs) in a wide region encompassing both the original and <b>duplicated</b> genes. Selection on the new <b>duplicated</b> copy and interlocus gene conversion between the two copies are incorporated. This simulation enables us to explore how selection on <b>duplicated</b> copies affects the pattern of SNPs. The fixation of an advantageous <b>duplicated</b> copy causes a strong reduction in polymorphism {{not only in the}} <b>duplicated</b> copy but also in its flanking regions, which is a typical signature of a selective sweep by positive selection. After fixation, polymorphism gradually increases by accumulating neutral mutations and eventually reaches the equilibrium value if there is no gene conversion. When gene conversion is active, the number of SNPs in the <b>duplicated</b> copy quickly increases by transferring SNPs from the original copy; therefore, the time when we can recognize the signature of selection is decreased. Because this effect of gene conversion is restricted only to the <b>duplicated</b> region, more power to detect selection is expected if a flanking region to the <b>duplicated</b> copy is used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Multiple {{models have}} been {{proposed}} to interpret the retention of <b>duplicated</b> genes. In this study, we attempted to compare whether the <b>duplicates</b> arising from tandem duplications and retropositions are retained by the same mechanisms in human and mouse genomes.

The duplicability of tandem <b>duplicates</b> is also higher than that of retrogenes. However, positive selection seems to play significant roles in the retention of both types of <b>duplicates.</b> Conclusions We propose that dosage effect is more prevalent in the retention of tandem <b>duplicates,</b> while 'escape from adaptive conflict' (EAC) effect is more prevalent in the retention of retrogenes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Using the genomic {{sequences}} of Drosophila melanogaster subgroup, {{the pattern of}} gene duplications was investigated with special attention to interlocus gene conversion. Our fine-scale analysis with careful visual inspections enabled accurate identification {{of a number of}} <b>duplicated</b> blocks (genomic regions). The orthologous parts of those <b>duplicated</b> blocks were also identified in the D. simulans and D. sechellia genomes, by which we were able to clearly classify the <b>duplicated</b> blocks into post- and pre-speciation blocks. We found 31 post-speciation <b>duplicated</b> genes, from which the rate of gene duplication (from one copy to two copies) is estimated to be 1. 0 × 10 − 9 per single-copy gene per year. The role of interlocus gene conversion was observed in several respects in our data: (1) synonymous divergence between a <b>duplicated</b> pair is overall very low. Consequently, the gene duplication rate would be seriously overestimated by counting <b>duplicated</b> genes with low divergence; (2) the sizes of young <b>duplicated</b> blocks are generally large. We postulate that the degeneration of gene conversion around the edges could explain the shrinkage of “identifiable” <b>duplicated</b> regions; and (3) elevated paralogous divergence is observed around the edges in many <b>duplicated</b> blocks, supporting our gene conversion–degeneration model. Our analysis demonstrated that gene conversion between <b>duplicated</b> regions is a common and genome-wide phenomenon in the Drosophila genomes, and that its role should be especially significant {{in the early stages of}} <b>duplicated</b> genes. Based on a population genetic prediction, we applied a new genome-scan method to test for signatures of selection for neofunctionalization and found a strong signature in a pair of transporter genes...|$|R

5000|$|Post 1982 Gottlieb {{continued}} to work on other enzyme systems produced by <b>duplicated</b> loci in different species. In Clarkia he reported that <b>duplicated</b> genes for 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6-PGD) occurred throughout the genus for both cytosolic and plastid 6-PGD. In homosporus ferns he found a <b>duplicated</b> gene for TPI, resulting in the only case of heterozygosity resulting from gene duplication in ferns—counter to previous theory. In Layia Gottlieb [...] found that isocitrate dehydrognease (IDH) isozymes had one gene controlling plastid IDH and 2-3 <b>duplicated</b> genes controlling cytosolic IDH. In this same study with Layia he found that phosphoglucomutase (PGM) also had one gene controlling plastid PGM, and <b>duplicated</b> cytosolic genes. He also examined six additional genera in the Madieae, and, with Layia representing 7 of the 10 genera in this tribe of the Asteraceae. Since {{he found that the}} <b>duplicated</b> cytosolic PGM were found in all the genera, he postulated that the duplication may have been present at the formation of this tribe, and hypothesized that examining PGM in other tribes may help understand phylogenic relationships in the Asteraceae. Further, he asserted that the discovery of <b>duplicated</b> genes in the tribe Madinae, along with the work of others, supported the view that <b>duplicated</b> genes in flowering plants was widespread. Additionally, since all such <b>duplicated</b> genes were unlinked, he favored the view that duplications were the result of overlapping reciprocal translocations rather than by unequal crossing-over. Gottlieb also appled PGM isozymes to species in the genus Clarkia, and found that some species had <b>duplicated</b> plastid PGM, others had <b>duplicated</b> cytosolic PGM, and that their phylogenetic distribution was consistent with earlier work on PGI.|$|R
40|$|Gene duplications are a {{major source}} of evolution-ary innovations. Understanding the {{functional}} diver-gence of <b>duplicates</b> and their role in genetic robustness is an important challenge in biology. Previously, analyses of genetic robustness were primarily focused on <b>duplicates</b> essentiality and epistasis in several laboratory conditions. In this study, we use several quantitative data sets to understand compensatory interactions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>duplicates</b> that are likely to be relevant in natural biological popula-tions. We find that, owing to their high functional load, close <b>duplicates</b> are unlikely to provide sub-stantial backup in the context of large natural popu-lations. Interestingly, as <b>duplicates</b> diverge from each other, their overall functional load is reduced. At intermediate divergence distances the quantita-tive decrease in fitness due to removal of one dupli-cate becomes smaller. At these distances, yeast <b>duplicates</b> display more balanced functional loads and their transcriptional control becomes signifi-cantly more complex. As yeast <b>duplicates</b> diverge beyond 70 % sequence identity, their ability to compensate for each other becomes similar to that of random pairs of singletons...|$|R
