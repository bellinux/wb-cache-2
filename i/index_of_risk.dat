40|$|Risk Management in Chinese banks has {{traditionally}} been the Cinderella of ist internal functions. Political stricture and developmental imperative have often overridden standard practice of risk management resulting in large non-performing loan (NPL) ratios. One of the stated aims of opening up the Chinese banks to foreign strategic investment {{is the development of}} risk management functions. In recent years NPL ratios have declined through a mixture of recovery, asset management operation and expanded balance sheets. However, the training and practice of risk managers remain second class compared with foreign banks operating in China. This paper evaluates bank performance using a Network DEA approach where an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> management practice and an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> management organisation are used as intermediate inputs in the production process. The two indices are constructed from a survey of risk managers in domestic banks and foreign banks operating in China.

For this reason, any infection, including oral infections,present a higher risk for this group of patients. Objective: To develop and implement an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> dental <b>risk</b> according to {{the severity of the}} lesions present in the oral cavity of pretransplant hemodialysis patients. Material and methods: The most prevalent infectious processes in the oral cavity were classified according to their severity, and an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> dental <b>risk</b> was developed for pretransplant renal patients. Thirteen patients of the Pro-Renal Foundation of Curitiba were selected and submitted to clinical and radiographic examination for the determination <b>of</b> the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> dental <b>risk</b> proposed in this study. Results: According to the pathologies diagnosed, the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> dental <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the patientscan be classified as low, medium or high, which indicates the need fordental treatment prior to renal transplantation. 38 % of the 13 patients submitted to clinical and radiographic examination were classified as high-risk patients.

This study shows, however, that such a strong correlation does not exist. Though, most individuals exhibit concave utility and convex probability weighting, the two components show no correlation.

We only make weak assumptions about the underlying deci- sion process, and our estimation method allows for generalisations of expected utility.

We also estimate a structural model based on Cumulative Prospect Theory and find that the value function depends on an index that is very similar to the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> aversion.

In this paper, the quantitative definition of risk given by Kaplan and Garrick is converted from a table to a graph to accommodate Farmer`s method of constructing a risk criterion. Farmer`s criterion is limited to a straight line, but its slope is made a free parameter.

Methods: We assessed the childhood adversity, psychopathology, physical complaints and health risk behaviours of 136 youths who had been identified by Child Protective Services and 80 youth not identified (control).

However, some of the risk behaviours were associated with different groups. Discussion: The literature has shown that maltreated children have a heightened risk of developing health problems, but our results suggest resilience and the importance of CPS intervention after maltreatment identification. However, CPS professionals, schools and communities need to focus on the strategies for health promotion and prevention of risk behaviours considering different young populations.
