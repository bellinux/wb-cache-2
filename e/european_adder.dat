40|$|We have {{revealed}} intra-population variability among venom samples from several individual <b>European</b> <b>adders</b> (Vipera berus berus) within a defined population in Eastern Hungary. Individual differences in venom pattern were noticed, both gender-specific and age-related, by one-dimensional electrophoresis. Gelatin zymography demonstrated that these individual venoms have different degradation profiles indicating varying protease {{activity in the}} specimens from adders of different ages and genders. Some specimens shared a conserved region of substrate degradation, while others had lower or extremely low protease activity. Phospholipase A 2 activity of venoms was similar but not identical. Interspecimen diversity of the venom phospholipase A 2 -spectra (based on the components' molecular masses) was detected by MALDI-TOF MS. The lethal toxicity of venoms (LD 50) also showed differences among individual snakes. Extracted venom samples had varying neuromuscular paralysing effect on chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparations. The paralysing effect of venom was lost when calcium in the physiological salt solution was replaced by strontium; indicating that the block of twitch responses to nerve stimulation {{is associated with the}} activity of a phospholipase-dependent neurotoxin. In contrast to the studied V.  b. berus venoms from different geographical regions so far, this is the first V.  b. berus population discovered to have predominantly neurotoxic neuromuscular activity. The relevance of varying venom yields is also discussed. This study demonstrates that individual venom variation among V.  b. berus living in particular area of Eastern Hungary might contribute to a wider range of clinical manifestations of V.  b. berus envenoming than elsewhere in Europe...|$|R

25|$|Snakes are {{the most}} common group of {{reptiles}} in the golden eagle's diet, making up about 2.9% of the remains from all studied golden eagle nests, though this figure can be much higher in parts of the range, as shown by studies in Japan (27.5%), Sicily (25.7%, one snake species), Arizona (14.9%, one snake species), Kazakhstan (9.7%, one snake species), and the French Pyrenees (9.7%). Usually colubrid snakes (sometimes called “harmless snakes”) are hunted but venomous species are also occasionally taken, especially the prairie rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) in North America and the <b>European</b> <b>adder</b> (Vipera berus) in Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} whether individual snakes are immune {{to their own}} venom {{has not yet been}} definitively settled, though there is a known example of a cobra which self-envenomated, resulting in a large abscess requiring surgical intervention, but showing none of the other effects that would have proven rapidly lethal in prey species or humans. Furthermore, certain harmless species, such as the North American common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula) and the Central and South American mussurana (Clelia spp.), are proof against the venom of the crotalines which frequent the same districts, and which they are able to overpower and feed upon. The chicken snake (Spilotes pullatus) is the enemy of the Fer-de-Lance (Bothrops caribbaeus) in St. Lucia, and it is said that in their encounters, the chicken snake is invariably the victor. Repeated experiments have shown the European grass snake (Natrix natrix) not to be affected by the bite of the <b>European</b> <b>adder</b> (Vipera berus) and the European asp (Vipera aspis), this being due to the presence, in the blood of the harmless snake, of toxic principles secreted by the parotid and labial glands, and analogous to those of the venom of these vipers. Several North American species of rat snakes as well as king snakes have proven to be immune or highly resistant to the venom of rattlesnake species.

50|$|Few {{species of}} {{reptiles}} or amphibians {{are found in}} Great Britain or Ireland. Only three snakes are native to Great Britain: the common <b>European</b> <b>adder,</b> the grass snake and the smooth snake; none are native to Ireland. In general, Great Britain has slightly more variation and native wild life, with weasels, polecats, wildcats, most shrews, moles, water voles, roe deer and common toads also being absent from Ireland. This pattern is also true for birds and insects. Notable exceptions include the Kerry slug and certain species of woodlouse native to Ireland but not Great Britain.|$|E
50|$|Like many {{temperate}} areas, Great Britain {{exhibits a}} {{relative lack of}} snakes, with the <b>European</b> <b>adder</b> being the only venomous snake to be found there. The other notable snakes found in Great Britain are the grass snake and the smooth snake. Great Britain has three native breeds of lizard: slowworms, sand lizards and viviparous lizards. There are also turtles, such as leatherback turtles {{to be found in}} the Irish Sea, although these are rarely seen by the public. Other reptile species exist but are not native: aesculapian snake, wall lizard and the green lizard.|$|E
50|$|Rivers {{and lakes}} of Moscow Oblast {{are rich in}} fish, such as ruff, carp, bream, bass, roaches, Chinese sleeper, perch and pike. There are six species of reptiles: three lizards (slowworm, {{viviparous}} lizard and sand lizard) and three snakes (<b>European</b> <b>adder,</b> grass snake and smooth snake). There is evidence for bog turtles in some areas. Amphibians are represented by 11 species including smooth newt, great crested newt, common toad, European green toad, common frog, moor frog, marsh frog, common spadefoot and European fire-bellied toad.

50|$|With the {{discovery}} of Mimomys salpetrierensis, the former hypothesis of defining the Lower Pleistocene and Middle Pleistocene through the disappearance of Mimomys has been called into question. This also applies to other species, such as Pliomys and Allocricetus, which were thought to have become extinct during the Eemian. Another example is the <b>European</b> <b>adder</b> (Vipera berus) which evolved towards the Baskian viper and now occupies the Cantabrian region and the Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaïcus), found in fossil form at the site.

50|$|The age of {{the forest}} {{and the range of}} {{habitats}} it contains make it a valuable area for wildlife, and it is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Its former status as a working or pasture forest has had a great effect on its ecology. This is particularly evident with the pollarded trees, which, as they have not been cut since the passing of the Epping Forest Act, have now grown massive crowns of thick, trunk-like branches with correspondingly large boles. This gives the trees an unusual appearance, not known in other forests. Often the weight of the branches cannot be supported by the parent tree, and the large amount of dead wood in the forest supports numerous rare species of fungi and invertebrates.Predominant tree species are pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), European hornbeam (Carpinus betuloides), silver birch (Betula pendula) and European holly (Ilex aquifolium). Indicator species of long-uninterrupted woodland include service-tree (Sorbus torminalis) butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus) and drooping sedge (Carex pendula) A wide range of animals are found, including fallow deer (Dama dama), muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) and <b>European</b> <b>adder</b> (Vipera berus).|$|E
50|$|The boreal forest, or taiga, {{supports}} {{a relatively small}} range of animals due to the harshness of the climate. Canada's boreal forest includes 85 species of mammals, 130 species of fish, and an estimated 32,000 species of insects. Insects {{play a critical role}} as pollinators, decomposers, and {{as a part of the}} food web. Many nesting birds rely on them for food in the summer months. The cold winters and short summers make the taiga a challenging biome for reptiles and amphibians, which depend on environmental conditions to regulate their body temperatures, and there are only a few species in the boreal forest including red-sided garter snake, common <b>European</b> <b>adder,</b> blue-spotted salamander, northern two-lined salamander, Siberian salamander, wood frog, northern leopard frog, boreal chorus frog, American toad, and Canadian toad. Most hibernate underground in winter. Fish of the taiga must be able to withstand cold water conditions and be able to adapt to life under ice-covered water. Species in the taiga include Alaska blackfish, northern pike, walleye, longnose sucker, white sucker, various species of cisco, lake whitefish, round whitefish, pygmy whitefish, Arctic lamprey, various grayling species, brook trout (including sea-run brook trout in the Hudson Bay area), chum salmon, Siberian taimen, lenok and lake chub.|$|E
