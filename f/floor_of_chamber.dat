50|$|A marble compass was {{set into}} the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> to mark {{the point where the}} four {{quadrants}} of the District of Columbia meet.|$|R
60|$|The {{distance}} {{from the bottom of}} the funnel to the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> beneath it could not have been great, for all three of the victims of Tario's wrath alighted unscathed.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly {{she slipped}} {{from the bed}} to the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber,</b> and, {{clasping}} the knees of Asmund, looked up through the meshes of her hair, while tears streamed from her beautiful eyes: ...|$|R
50|$|The City Council {{chambers}} is a semi-circular room {{located on}} the second floor. On the main <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chambers</b> are the seats for the 44 members of Council, arranged in a horseshoe-shaped arrangement.|$|R

60|$|Lu-don, {{the high}} priest, licked his thin lips {{and rubbed his}} bony white hands {{together}} in gratification as Pan-sat bore Jane Clayton into his presence and laid her on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> before him.|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{uses the}} walls <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> {{as a working}} surface, rather than the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber,</b> and in turn {{increases}} its working surface area from about 25 percent to more than 70 percent. Levi holds multiple U.S. and international patents for the IRIS design.|$|R
60|$|The <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> was <b>of</b> concrete, {{the walls}} of smooth granite, upon which strange figures of men and beasts were carved. In places tablets of yellow metal had been set in the solid masonry of the walls.|$|R
50|$|Tectum is the thin, dark, dense {{outer layer}} of the spirotheca, Keriotheca is the thicker, honeycomb-like alveolar, inner layer. Chomata are mounds {{secreted}} on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> that connect {{either side of the}} tunnel, which interconnects the chambers.|$|R
50|$|Senators {{introduce}} a proposed {{law in the}} Senate {{in the form of}} a bill, which must be approved by a standing committee, the Committee of the Whole and the entire membership <b>of</b> the <b>chamber.</b> Bills are subject to amendment by other senators in committee or on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
50|$|John Wilson, {{the speaker}} of the Arkansas House of Representatives, stabbed Representative J. J. Anthony to death during a {{legislative}} debate on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> in 1837. Wilson was later acquitted. The Old State House is said to be haunted to this day.|$|R
50|$|A horn-shaped {{ventilation}} cowl {{is usually}} fitted facing {{forward to a}} large hole at the top <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> {{at one end of}} the box with another large hole opening down into the boat from the chamber at the other end.

60|$|Again he {{commenced}} his groping advance; {{but this}} time he had gone but a short distance when he emerged into a room, which was lighted through an opening in the ceiling, from which a flight of concrete steps led downward to the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
60|$|Standing in his {{accustomed}} {{place on}} the iron <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the iron <b>chamber,</b> Edgar Berrington watched the grinding of the great crank, and pondered.|$|R

50|$|The large <b>chamber</b> <b>of</b> Moaning Cavern draws {{large numbers}} of guests every year to see {{the beauty of the}} cave. As of today, {{there are two ways to}} enter the main chamber. The most typical mean of entry is the walking tour. The walking tour takes the stairs all the way to the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber,</b> 165 feet below the {{visitors}} center, on a 45-minute informative trip. There is also a more adventurous way into the cave. The natural entrance was converted into a rappelling route in the mid 80's. Now guest are welcome to rappel down a vertical cavern sixteen and half stories to the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber.</b> This adventure does seem like a manageable task but it is not for the faint of heart. After the first 30 feet down the chimney, you pop into the ceiling of the cavern nearly 15 stories above the floor.|$|R
5000|$|In The Cabin in the Woods, a five-sided swastika-like {{design has}} been crafted into the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the ritual <b>chamber.</b> Beneath it the [...] "Ancient Ones" [...] lie slumbering.|$|R

60|$|I was {{the last}} to leave the <b>chamber</b> <b>of</b> the submarine, and as I {{followed}} the rear of the column toward the corridor, I moved through water to my knees. The corridor, too, was flooded to the same depth, for its floor was on a level with the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> from which it led, nor was there any perceptible rise for many yards.|$|R
50|$|The tomb {{appears to}} have been reused during the 22nd dynasty. It was reused again during the Roman Period when an {{additional}} pit was dug into the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the sarcophagus <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{the dead}} O-Mai lying upon the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> his {{sleeping}} <b>chamber</b> {{with one foot}} tangled in the sleeping silks and furs upon his couch. I heard horrid moans and frightful screams." ...|$|R
50|$|At the 6th century B.C.E. {{archaeological site}} of Cancho Roano, located near Zalamea de la Serena, Badajoz, Spain, a large {{feature in the}} shape of the rod and ring symbol was modeled into the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the {{innermost}} <b>chamber</b> <b>of</b> a Tartessian temple.|$|R
25|$|Discussion in General Synod was lengthy. Hundreds of {{amendments}} to the initial proposals were debated on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber.</b> Debate {{about the significance of}} the communion was taken up again. Since very many more parishes had, following the influence of the Parish Communion movement, already adopted the Eucharist as their main service, debates about it became even more pertinent.|$|R
5000|$|Fourth stage, {{commonly}} referred to as the Report Stage. At this point, a version of the bill incorporating any changes made at the Committee Stage is printed for consideration.

6000|$|I {{then took}} up three planks from the <b>flooring</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber,</b> and {{deposited}} all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye--not even his--could have detected any thing wrong. There {{was nothing to}} wash out--no stain of any kind--no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all--ha! ha! ...|$|R
50|$|The Speaker of the Kansas House of Representatives is {{the leader}} <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> and is elected by his fellow state representatives. The speaker presides over the {{legislative}} process on the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> or appoints a presiding officer {{in his or her}} place.

These bills were not brought to the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> either <b>chamber</b> for a vote.|$|R
60|$|A venerable {{mirror of}} plate glass {{stood on the}} toilet, in which belles of former centuries may have {{contemplated}} and decorated their charms. The <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> was <b>of</b> tesselated oak, shining with wax, and partly covered by a Turkey carpet. In the centre stood a massy oaken table, waxed and polished as smooth as glass, and furnished with a writing-desk of perfumed rosewood.|$|R
60|$|Tal Hajus arose, and I, half fearing, half anticipating his intentions, {{hurried to}} the winding runway {{which led to the}} floors below. No one was near to {{intercept}} me, and I reached the main <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> unobserved, taking my station {{in the shadow of the}} same column that Tars Tarkas had but just deserted. As I reached the floor Tal Hajus was speaking.|$|R
60|$|The sick woman {{seized the}} sheet and pulled it from the bed; the clothes came with it, {{but she did not}} mind that. She pulled herself painfully up the {{stairway}} and across the rough <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the <b>chamber</b> to the window which looked toward her sister's house, and with a wild exultation flung the sheet far out and dropped on her knees beside the open window.|$|R
60|$|On the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> this <b>chamber,</b> {{which was}} dotted with highly carved wooden desks and chairs, were {{assembled}} about forty or fifty male Martians around {{the steps of}} a rostrum. On the platform proper squatted an enormous warrior heavily loaded with metal ornaments, gay-colored feathers and beautifully wrought leather trappings ingeniously set with precious stones. From his shoulders depended a short cape of white fur lined with brilliant scarlet silk.|$|R
50|$|Ankhesenpepi III {{was buried}} in a pyramid near that of Pepi I. The main part of her {{sarcophagus}} was made of sandstone and embedded in the <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the burial <b>chamber.</b> The lid <b>of</b> the sarcophagus was made of pink granite.|$|R
