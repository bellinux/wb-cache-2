25|$|Many of {{the young}} Kashgari women were most {{attractive}} in appearance, {{and some of the}} little girls quite lovely, their plaits of long <b>hair</b> <b>falling</b> from under a jaunty little embroidered cap, their big dark eyes, flashing teeth and piquant olive faces reminding me of Italian or Spanish children. One most beautiful boy stands out in my memory. He was clad in a new shirt and trousers of flowered pink, his crimson velvet cap embroidered with gold, and as he smiled and salaamed to us I thought he looked like a fairy prince. The women wear their hair in two or five plaits much thickened and lengthened by the addition of yak's hair, but the children in several tiny plaits.|$|E

Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity. In any event, as critic Greil Marcus describes, Presley [...] "did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn {{on the first two}} shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the <b>hair</b> <b>falling</b> in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out." [...] To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, [...] "Peace in the Valley". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley [...] "a real decent, fine boy".|$|E

500|$|Historically this square {{was used}} for public decapitations by rulers who sought to {{maintain}} their power by frightening the public. The square attracted dwellers from the surrounding desert and mountains to trade here, and stalls were raised in the square from early in its history. The square attracted tradesmen, snake charmers ("wild, dark, frenzied men with long disheveled <b>hair</b> <b>falling</b> over their naked shoulders"), dancing boys of the Chleuh Atlas tribe, and musicians playing pipes, tambourines and African drums. Richard Hamilton said that Jemaa el-Fnaa once [...] "reeked of Berber particularism, of backward-looking, ill-educated countrymen, rather than the reformist, pan-Arab internationalism and command economy that were the imagined future." [...] Today the square attracts people from a diversity of social and ethnic backgrounds and tourists {{from all around the}} world. Snake charmers, acrobats, magicians, mystics, musicians, monkey trainers, herb sellers, story-tellers, dentists, pickpockets, and entertainers in medieval garb still populate the square.|$|E

They are depicted nude with their index fingers placed in their mouths and a lock of <b>hair</b> <b>falling</b> {{on one side of}} their heads, indicating that they were below the age of puberty, when Egyptian children were given an [...] "adult" [...] haircut. Seneb and his son are shown with darker skin colouring than his wife and daughter. This was a standard artistic convention used to indicate gender and status, reflecting the fact that high-ranking females would remain indoors and retain a light skin colour while males would gain a darker skin from the hot Egyptian sun. The names of three children are recorded, though the third child was not depicted on the sculpture - presumably for reasons of symmetry. They were named after Seneb's royal masters; his son was called Radjedef-Ankh ("May Radjedef live"), his eldest daughter was Awib-Khufu ("Happy is Khufu") and his younger daughter was Smeret-Radjedef ("Companion of Radjedef"). They are depicted with normal proportions, suggesting that they did not inherit their father's condition.|$|E

500|$|Keable {{remained}} in Tahiti, his health worsening. He suffered weight loss, diabetes, {{high blood pressure}} and fever, all stemming from a kidney illness. Nonetheless, he completed the novel Numerous Treasure, which he had begun before Buck's death; the bittersweet tale of a Polynesian woman who shared her name with a cocktail and a brand of cigarettes was a commercial success, and has been considered a valuable portrait of early-century Tahitian life. His health and spirits rallied in the years after Buck's death: he completed a travel book, Tahiti, Isle of Dreams, and a book tour of the United States and Europe. On returning to Tahiti he struck up a relationship with a mixed-race islander named Ina, and made many new friends including the writers Alec Waugh (elder brother of Evelyn), who had been inspired to visit Tahiti by Numerous Treasure, Zane Grey, and James Norman Hall. Waugh described the Keable of this period [...] "reclined among cushions, clad only in a pareo, while his Tahitian princess, bare-shouldered and bare-footed, her black <b>hair</b> <b>falling</b> to her waist and a white flower behind her ear, glided negligently about the house" [...] – and yet noted that, on suggesting a cup of tea, Keable's voice still took on [...] "the parsonical intonation with which fifteen years earlier he had summoned the parish children to a Sunday school treat." ...|$|E
500|$|In his PopMatters review, John Bergstrom likens All Things Must Pass to [...] "the {{sound of}} Harrison exhaling", noting: [...] "He was quite {{possibly}} the only Beatle who was completely {{satisfied with the}} Beatles being gone." [...] Bergstrom credits the album with heavily influencing bands such as ELO, My Morning Jacket, Fleet Foxes and Grizzly Bear, as well as helping bring about the dream pop phenomenon. Another Rolling Stone critic, James Hunter, commented in 2001 on how All Things Must Pass [...] "helped define the decade it ushered in", in that [...] "the cast, the length, the long <b>hair</b> <b>falling</b> on suede-covered shoulders... foretold the sprawl and sleepy ambition of the Seventies." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Mac Randall writes that the album is exceptional, but [...] "a tad overrated" [...] by those critics who tend to overlook how its last 30 minutes comprise [...] "a bunch of instrumental blues jams that nobody listens to more than once". Unterberger similarly cites the inclusion of Apple Jam as [...] "a very significant flaw", while recognising that its content [...] "proved to be of immense musical importance", {{with the formation of}} Derek and the Dominos. Writing for Pitchfork Media in 2016, Jayson Green said that Harrison was the only former Beatle who [...] "changed the terms of what an album could be" [...] since, although All Things Must Pass was not the first rock triple LP, [...] "in the cultural imagination, it is the first triple album, the first one released as a pointed statement." ...|$|E

The single's cover art was also revealed, depicting Gaga wearing a black floppy hat with her brunette <b>hair</b> <b>falling</b> over her shoulders, an oversized [...] "boxy" [...] double-breasted blazer, sheer underwear, one black leather boot and a grill that made her teeth appear larger. Her eyes are covered by a scarf and she has bruises on her belly and around her crotch area. Idolator writer Mike Wass named the cover art [...] "a cross between Frankenstein and Michael Jackson". Matthew Jacobs from The Huffington Post found the cover relatively modest compared to the previous single covers of songs from Artpop. John Walker from MTV News compared the cover to director Tim Burton's works and called it [...] "terrifying". He described Gaga's face and the grills as [...] " [...] the gum-less teeth of a long-buried skull cast in titanium" [...] and believed that the hands and legs were prosthetic. Walker concluded {{by saying that the}} cover reminded him of a [...] "bizarro world" [...] version of singer Janet Jackson's [...] for a 1993 Rolling Stone issue. Lily Harrison from E! Online complimented Gaga for taking the fashion of grills to a [...] "whole new level". She commended the singer's ability to portray her toned figure in spite of the [...] "odd ensemble". A writer for Metro felt that the singer was as [...] "peculiar as ever" [...] on the artwork. Emma Kelly from Daily Star called the cover [...] "creepier" [...] than any horror film and felt that the wide jacket made the singer appear as a rugby player. She compared the digitally altered smile on the single cover to the cover of electronic musician Aphex Twin's EP, Come to Daddy (1997) which features similar inflated grills. Fashion website Refinery29's Leila Brillson felt that the artwork was more of a surrealist move which made Gaga look like a [...] "nightmarish" [...] version of virtual band Gorillaz. Brillson was also unclear if the bruises were related to the song.|$|E

[...] It was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although {{much has been made of}} the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of [...] "Hound Dog", all of the songs on this show were ballads.
