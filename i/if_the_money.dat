5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}. Low purchasing power {{means that the}} real income of the people is low, although in monetary terms it may be high. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> income were low, the problem could easily be overcome by expanding the money supply; however, since the meaning {{in this context is}} real income, expanding the supply of money will only generate inflationary pressure. Neither real output nor real investment will rise. It is to be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
5|$|Due to its poor performance, Friedman {{believed}} that the Federal Reserve Board should be abolished. Friedman was deeply critical about Federal Reserve policies, even during the so-called 'Volcker shock' that was labelled 'monetarist.' He further {{believed that}} <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve System) that the preferable {{way to do it}} would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the Treasury's {{withdrawal}} of funding, in May 1898 the churchwardens of St Botolph's Aldersgate brokered a compromise with the CPF. The disputed site was split into two parts, each priced at £6,000. The western section would be purchased immediately using £6,000 of the £7,000 already raised, with an option to purchase the eastern section if the remaining £5,000 could be raised within two years, after which the CPF would go ahead with building plans <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> could not be raised.|$|E

5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> is not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E

25|$|The Chicago School of {{economics}} {{is best known}} for its free market advocacy and monetarist ideas. According to Milton Friedman and monetarists, market economies are inherently stable <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> supply does not greatly expand or contract.

25|$|It {{follows that}} if one has to choose between {{receiving}} $100 today and $100 in one year, the rational decision is to cash the $100 today. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> is to be received in one year and assuming the savings account interest rate is 5%, the person has to be offered at least $105 in one year so that two options are equivalent (either receiving $100 today or receiving $105 in one year). This is because if you have cash of $100 today and deposit in your savings account, you will have $105 in one year.|$|E
25|$|It {{was widely}} felt that Delhi's lack of enthusiasm {{to host the}} event was {{the primary reason for}} its loss. Then Union Sports Minister of India, Mani Shankar Aiyar, spoke {{strongly}} against Delhi hosting the games and argued that it was better <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> allocated by India's government for organizing the sporting event was spent on building facilities for the poor. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president revealed that India's Sports Minister remarks against hosting the Games was the main reason for New Delhi's loss. The IOA delegation also added that the bids evaluation committee was concerned about pollution and traffic in Delhi. Delhi offering US$200,000 to each team for games support against Incheon's offer of US$20 million to all 45 nations participating in the event could also have contributed to the defeat.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the city}} {{administration}} has been widely criticized for heavy destruction that has affected many historical buildings. As much as a third of historic Moscow has been destroyed {{in the past few}} years to make space for luxury apartments and hotels. Other historical buildings, including such landmarks as the 1930 Moskva hotel and the 1913 department store Voyentorg, have been razed and reconstructed anew, with the inevitable loss of historical value. Critics blame the government for not enforcing conservation laws: in the last 12 years more than 50 buildings with monument status were torn down, several of those dating back to the 17th century. Some critics also wonder <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> used for the reconstruction of razed buildings could not be used for the renovation of decaying structures, which include many works by architect Konstantin Melnikov and Mayakovskaya metro station.|$|E

25|$|An August 2007 Quinnipiac University {{poll found}} that New York City voters opposed the plan 57% to 36%. Most of the {{opposition}} came from the outer boroughs, which {{with the exception of}} the Bronx would lose their toll-free access under the plan. On the other hand, 58% of voters would support the plan if the funds were used toward improving mass transit. A subsequent poll in March 2008 found that New York City voters supported Congestion Pricing by a margin of 67 percent to 27 percent <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> were used for mass transit improvements, and statewide voters supported the plan 60% to 30%, although the majority of New Yorkers were unaware that a $1 taxi surcharge was included in the plan.

25|$|During one OOF {{meeting in}} June, a Motion {{was made on}} behalf of Dr. Spong and OrcaLab to use OOF funds to {{contract}} commercial fishermen from the Namgis First Nation of Johnstone Strait, BC, to catch and provide wild salmon for Springer {{while she was in}} her seapen in Dongchong Bay, Hanson Island, the repatriation site and territory of the Namgis. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> were approved, Dr. Spong would help arrange an out-of-season fishing permit from DFO, and Namgis Chief Bill Cranmer would put together a boat and crew. A member of OOF, together with a representative from NMFS present at the meeting, urged instead the use of farmed Atlantic salmon provided by a local aquaculture company, even though the First Nations in the region were adamantly opposed to fish farms in their waters. It was argued that the logistics of feeding Springer wild fish was too much to take on for the team, particularly this close to the capture date.|$|E
25|$|Throughout this time, Bert Bell, {{co-owner}} of the Philadelphia Eagles, felt his team's lack of competitiveness on the field {{made it difficult for}} the Eagles to sell tickets and to be profitable. Compounding the Eagles' problems were players signed with teams that offered the most money, or <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> being equal, players chose to sign with the most prestigious teams at the time, who had established a winning tradition. As a result, the NFL was dominated by the Chicago Bears, Green Bay Packers, Giants, and Redskins. Bell's inability to sign a desired prospect, Stan Kostka, in 1935, eventually led Bell to believe the only way for the NFL to have enduring success was for all teams to have an equal opportunity to sign eligible players. At a league meeting on May 18, 1935, Bell proposed a draft be instituted to enhance the possibility of competitive parity on the field in order to ensure the financial viability of all franchises. His proposal was adopted unanimously that day, although the first draft would not occur until the next off-season.|$|E

500|$|Civil {{war broke}} out again in England in 1215 between forces loyal to King John and rebel barons, {{supported}} in due course by Prince Louis of France, in what gas {{become known as the}} First Barons' War.

[...] He asserted that the team would not be in such dire financial straits if that bonus money had not been paid. [...] Putnam said that he would need to raise $750,000 by November 28 so the team could pay back taxes due to the state, county, and city as well as the salaries of players who had not been paid in four weeks.
