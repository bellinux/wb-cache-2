50|$|The very lightest, most {{volatile}} {{liquid hydrocarbon}} solvents {{that can be}} bought from laboratory chemical suppliers may also be offered under the name petroleum ether. Petroleum ether consists mainly of aliphatic hydrocarbons and is usually low on aromatics. It is commonly <b>hydrodesulfurized</b> and may be hydrogenated {{to reduce the amount}} of aromatic and other unsaturated hydrocarbons. Petroleum ether bears normally a descriptive suffix giving the boiling range. Thus, from the leading international laboratory chemical suppliers it is possible to buy various petroleum ethers with boiling ranges such as 30-50 °C, 40-60 °C, 50-70 °C, 60-80 °C, etc. In the United States, laboratory grade aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents with boiling ranges as high as 100-140 °C may be called petroleum ether, rather than petroleum spirit.|$|E
40|$|A 700 ml membrane-aerated, stirred {{glass reactor}} {{equipped}} with four vertical baffles was constructed. Biodesulfurization of model oil (n-dodecane containing dibenzothiophene-DBT) and <b>hydrodesulfurized</b> diesel {{was carried out}} using Pseudomonas delafieldii strain R- 8. Microbubble aeration gave an activity of 1. 3 mg DBT removed g(- 1) h(- 1) and 277 mu g sulfur g(- 1) h(- 1) for model oil and <b>hydrodesulfurized</b> diesel, respectively. These values were 1. 9 - and 1. 6 -times higher than using a traditional bubble aeration process. This is a promising method for the biodesulfurization of petroleum feedstocks...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory-scale {{screening}} tests {{were carried out}} on coal from Harrison County, Ohio to establish chlorination and hydrodesulfurization conditions for the batch reactor production of chlorinolysis and chlorinolysis-hydrodesulfurized coals. In addition, three bituminous coals, were treated on the lab scale by the chlorinolysis process to provide 39 to 62 % desulfurization. Two bituminous coals and one subbituminous coal were then produced in 11 to 15 pound lots as chlorinolysis and <b>hydrodesulfurized</b> coals. The chlorinolysis coals had a desulfurization of 29 - 69 %, reductions in voltatiles and hydrogen. Hydrodesulfurization provided a much greater desulfurization (56 - 86 %), reductions in volatiles and hydrogen. The three coals were combustion tested in the Penn State ""plane flame furnace'' to determine ignition and burning characteristics. All three coals burned well to completion as: raw coals, chlorinolysis processed coals, and <b>hydrodesulfurized</b> coals. The <b>hydrodesulfurized</b> coals experienced greater ignition delays and reduced burning rates than the other coals because of the reduced volatile content. It is thought that the increased open pore volume in the desulfurized-devolatilized coals compensates in part for the decreased volatiles effect on ignition and burning...|$|E

40|$|New {{desulfurizing}} bacteria able {{to convert}} dibenzothiophene into 2 -hydroxybiphenyl and sulfate were isolated from contaminated soils collected in Mexican refineries. Random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis showed they {{were different from}} previously reported Rhodococcus erythropolis desulfurizing strains. According to 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and fatty acid analyses, these new isolates belonged to the genus Rhodococcus. These strains could desulfurize 4, 6 -dimethyldibenzothiophene {{which is one of}} the most difficult dibenzothiophene derivatives to remove by hydrodesulfurization. A deeply <b>hydrodesulfurized</b> diesel oil containing significant amounts of 4, 6 -dimethyldibenzothiophene was treated with Rhodococcus sp. IMP-S 02 cells.

30|$|The HDS {{activity}} {{tests of}} the NiMo catalysts were carried out in a bench-scale stainless-steel tubular reactor at 300  °C and 6.0  MPa using a sulfur-free lube base oil solution of DBT (1000  ppm of S) as HDS feedstock. The lube base oil was provided by Sinopec Shanghai Gaoqiao Petrochemical Corporation (China). Prior to catalytic HDS, the catalysts were sulfided by a mixture of 2  wt% CS 2 and cyclohexane with the following temperature program: reactor temperature was raised to 230  °C from room temperature at a heating rate of 7  °C/min and kept at 230  °C for 3  h; then the temperature was raised to 340  °C at a heating rate of 3  °C/min and kept at 340  °C for 3  h. The presulfiding conditions were as follows: {{liquid hourly space velocity}} (LHSV), 5  h− 1; H 2 /Oil (v/v) ratio, 200; operation pressure, 6.0  MPa. After sulfidation, the stream was switched from sulfiding agent to HDS feedstock and maintained for 20  h to achieve catalyst stability, and the <b>hydrodesulfurized</b> sample was collected at the appropriate time (the time interval depended on the LHSV). Then, these samples were washed with 5  wt% sodium hydroxide solution three times to remove the dissolved H 2 S.

The objectives were to assess the potential for target organ toxicity and neurotoxicity. The HDS kerosene was applied to the shaved backs of Sprague-Dawley CD rats, 12 /sex/group, 6 h/d, 5 d/wk in doses of 0 (vehicle control), 165 mg/kg (20 % HDS kerosene), 330 mg/kg (40 % HDS kerosene), or 495 mg/kg (60 % HDS kerosene). Additional rats (12 /sex) from the control and the high-dose groups were held without treatment for 4 weeks to assess recovery. Standard parameters of toxicity were investigated during the in-life phase. At necropsy, organs were weighed and selected tissues were processed for microscopic evaluation. Neurobehavioral evaluations included tests of motor activity and functional observations that were conducted pretest, at intervals during the exposure period and after recovery. No test substance-related effects on mortality, clinical observations (except dermal irritation), body weight, or clinical chemistry values were observed. A dose-related increase in skin irritation, confirmed histologically as minimal, was evident at the dosing site. The only statistically significant change considered potentially treatment related was an increase in the neutrophil count in females at 13 weeks. No test article-related effects were observed in the neurobehavioral assessments or gross or microscopic findings in the peripheral or central nervous system tissues in any of the dose groups.

40|$|Substitution of {{hazardous}} substances against less hazardous ones {{is a central}} requirement of the European Chemical Regulation REACH (European Regulation 1907 / 2006 /EC). Hazardous substances emitted from products may not only affect the worker; drift off and distribution in the environment may finally result in exposure of the general population. This potential threat to health is covered by the impact category “toxicity” in Life Cycle Assessments. In this paper, we present {{a case of a}} substitution of volatile organic compounds in a reactive varnish, and compare the “old” formulation with the “new” formulation against health risk to the worker, and concerning the Life Cycle Assessment impact category “toxicity”. The “old” formulation contained Naphtha (petroleum), <b>hydrodesulfurized,</b> heavy and Solvent naphtha (petroleum), light, aromatic. In the new formulation, both naphthas were replaced by n-Butylacetate, 1 -Ethoxy- 2 -propyl acetate and Ethyl- 3 -ethoxy propionate. In the European Union, the naphthas are classified as mutagens and carcinogens category 1, officially. However, if benzene is below 0. 1 %, registrants in the EU proposed to omit this classification, and todays naptha products on the market obviously have benzene contents below 0. 1 %. On a first glance, the improvement for workplace safety introduced by the substitution, therefore, is comparatively small, as it is for toxicity in Life Cycle Assessment. However, when background knowledge concerning chemical production processes of naphtha is included, benzene below a content of 0. 1 % needs to be taken into consideration, and the benefit of substitution is more obvious...|$|E
40|$|Rhodococcus erythropolis I- 19, {{containing}} multiple {{copies of}} key dsz genes, {{was used to}} desulfurize alkylated dibenzothiophenes (Cx-DBTs) found in a <b>hydrodesulfurized</b> middle-distillate petroleum (MD 1850). Initial desulfurization rates of dibenzothiophene (DBT) and MD 1850 by I- 19 were 5. 0 and 2. 5 μmol g dry cell weight− 1 min− 1, more than 25 -fold higher than that for wild-type bacteria. According to sulfur K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis, thiophenic compounds accounted for > 95 % of the total sulfur found in MD 1850, predominantly Cx-DBTs and alkylated benzothiophenes. Extensive biodesulfurization resulted in a 67 % reduction of total sulfur from 1, 850 to 615 ppm S. XANES analysis of the 615 -ppm material gave a sulfur distribution of 75 % thiophenes, 11 % sulfides, 2 % sulfoxides, and 12 % sulfones. I- 19 preferentially desulfurized DBT and C 1 -DBTs, followed by the more highly alkylated Cx-DBTs. Shifting zero- to first-order (first-order) desulfurization rate kinetics were observed when MD 1850 was diluted with hexadecane. Apparent saturation rate constant (K 0) and half-saturation rate constant (K 1) values were calculated to be 2. 8 μmol g dry cell weight− 1 min− 1 and 130 ppm, respectively. However, partial biocatalytic reduction of MD 1850 sulfur concentration followed by determination of initial rates with fresh biocatalyst led to a sigmoidal kinetic behavior. A competitive-substrate model suggested that the apparent K 1 values for each group of Cx-DBTs increased with increasing alkylation. Overall desulfurization rate kinetics with I- 19 were affected by the concentration and distribution of Cx-DBTs according to the number and/or lengths of alkyl groups attached to the basic ring structure...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of Petro Star diesel sulfur species is complete and a report is attached. Further analytical efforts {{will concentrate on}} characterization of diesel fuel, <b>hydrodesulfurized</b> to varying degrees, {{in order to determine}} sulfur species that may be problematic to hydrogen treatment and represent potential target substrates for biodesulfurization in a combined HDS-BDS process. Quotes have been received and are being considered for the partial treatment of Petro Star Inc. marine diesel fuel. Direction of research is changing slightly; economic {{analysis of}} the hyphenated [...] BDSHDS, BDS-CED [...] has shown the highest probability of success to be with a BDS-HDS process where the biodesulfurization precedes hydrodesulfurization. Thus, the microorganisms will be tailored to focus on those compounds that tend to be recalcitrant to hydrodesulfurization and decrease the severity of the hydrodesulfurization step. A separate, detailed justification for this change is being prepared. Research activities have continued in the characterization of the desulfurization enzymes from multiple sources. Genes for all DszA, -B, -C and -D enzymes (and homologs) have been cloned and expressed. Activity determinations, on a variety of substituted benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene substrates, have been carried out and continue. In addition, chemical synthesis efforts have been carried out to generate additional substrates for analytical standards and activity determinations. The generation of a GSSM mutant library of the ''Rhodococcus IGTS 8 dszA'' gene has been completed and development of protocols for a high throughput screen to expand substrate specificity are nearing completion. In an effort to obtain improved hosts as biocatalyst, one hundred-thirty ''Rhodococcus'' and related strains are being evaluated for growth characteristics and other criteria deemed important for an optimal biocatalyst strain. We have also begun an effort to generate derivatives of the entire IGTS 8 BDS plasmid that will allow for its easy transfer and manipulation into a variety of hosts. To support this activity and to gain an understanding of additional genes that may potentially affect BDS activity, the nucleotide sequence of the entire complement of plasmids in IGTS 8 is being determined. Lastly, we continue to develop genetic screens and selections for the discovery and improvement of the biodesulfurization genes and strains...|$|E
