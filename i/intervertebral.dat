5|$|Gliding motions {{occur between}} flat surfaces, {{such as in}} the <b>intervertebral</b> discs or between the carpal and {{metacarpal}} bones of the hand.|$|E
5|$|Total disc {{replacement}} is {{an experimental}} option, but no significant evidence supports its use over lumbar fusion. Researchers {{are investigating the}} possibility of growing new <b>intervertebral</b> structures {{through the use of}} injected human growth factors, implanted substances, cell therapy, and tissue engineering.|$|E
5|$|Due to the breed's {{elongated}} body, {{there can}} be back problems within the breed, specifically with <b>intervertebral</b> discs in the dog's back. These discs can sometimes slip out of place, resulting in spinal disc herniation. Symptoms depend on {{what part of the}} dog's back is affected; they can include paralysis with loss of bladder and bowel control in the worst cases.|$|E
5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface of the bone, including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms <b>intervertebral</b> disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|S.iniae has {{occasionally}} produced {{infection in}} humans, especially fish handlers of Asian descent. Human infections include sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and {{inflammation of the}} skin, <b>intervertebral</b> discs, or inner layer of the heart. Identifying S.iniae in the laboratory can be difficult, since the conventional methods used to identify streptococci yield insufficient results. It cannot be grouped by the Lancefield antigen method typically used to categorize Streptococcus species. The two known serotypes can be distinguished biochemically by differences in enzyme activity. Several antibiotics {{have been used to}} treat S.iniae infections.|$|E
5|$|Also {{commonly}} called spinal disc herniation, {{this is where}} the <b>intervertebral</b> disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. When the cord is compressed, the dog can experience symptoms ranging in scope from mild back or neck pain to paralysis of limbs, loss of sensation, and loss of bladder or bowel control. It is most commonly seen in the mid-back area, but can occur anywhere along the spine. Mild cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal in a crate to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, which can be accompanied by pain medication. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the <b>intervertebral</b> disc {{as a source for}} back pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As a result of this work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would have limited {{movement of the}} neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of <b>intervertebral</b> cartilage to determine {{the flexibility of the}} neck of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. He found that the neck of Apatosaurus was very flexible.|$|E
5|$|Spinal disc {{herniation}} {{occurs when}} the <b>Intervertebral</b> disc bulges or ruptures into the vertebral canal where the spinal cord resides. Once the cord is compressed, the dog experiences symptoms ranging from mild back/neck pain to leg paralysis, loss of sensation, and urinary and fecal incontinence. The most commonly location seen is the mid-back area, but it may occur anywhere along the spine. Cases that do not result in paralysis can be treated medically by confining the animal to restrict movement to a minimum for several weeks, and this can be accompanied by medication for the pain. Surgery can restore sensation to a dog's legs following paralysis but the success rate depends on how severe the herniation was.|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known {{vertebrae}} of Plesiorycteropus. The animal had {{at least}} seven sacral and five or six lumbar vertebrae. A find of associated caudal vertebrae {{from the base of}} the tail, which diminish in size only slowly from front to back, suggests that the tail was long. There is no evidence for the additional joints between the vertebrae that are characteristic of xenarthrans. In the seven known thoracic (chest) vertebrae, the articulations with the <b>intervertebral</b> disks are bean-shaped and much wider from side to side than from top to bottom. In the back thoracics and all lumbars, a longitudinal transarcual canal is present in the neural arch.|$|E
5|$|An <b>intervertebral</b> disc has a {{gelatinous}} core {{surrounded by}} a fibrous ring. When in its normal, uninjured state, most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run {{to the outside of}} the disc. Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc. Over time, the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces. This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine, causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae. As a result, there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass. When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease, the makeup of a disc changes: blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and/or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root. Any of these changes may result in back pain.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan {{and at some point}} in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the <b>intervertebral</b> discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
25|$|The {{notochord}} disappears in the sclerotome (vertebral body) segments, but {{persists in}} the region of the <b>intervertebral</b> discs as the nucleus pulposus. The nucleus pulposus and the fibers of the anulus fibrosus make up the <b>intervertebral</b> disc.|$|E
25|$|Discography, an {{invasive}} {{diagnostic procedure}} for evaluation for <b>intervertebral</b> disc pathology.|$|E
25|$|The less dense {{tissue that}} {{separates}} the sclerotome segments develop into the <b>intervertebral</b> discs.|$|E
25|$|In humans {{vertebral}} column there are normally thirty-three vertebrae; the upper twenty-four are articulating and separated {{from each other}} by <b>intervertebral</b> discs, and the lower nine are fused in adults, five in the sacrum and four in the coccyx or tailbone.|$|E
25|$|Autotomy of the tail, {{a feature}} {{found in some}} lizards is absent in most snakes. Caudal {{autotomy}} in snakes is rare and is <b>intervertebral,</b> unlike that in lizards, which is intravertebral—that is, the break happens along a predefined fracture plane present on a vertebra.|$|E
25|$|Movement is {{not limited}} to only {{synovial}} joints, although they allow for most freedom. Muscles also run over symphysis, which allow for movement in for example the vertebral column by compression of the <b>intervertebral</b> discs. Additionally, synovial joints can be divided into different types, depending on their axis of movement.|$|E
25|$|Above {{and below}} each {{vertebra}} are joints called facet joints. These restrict {{the range of}} movement possible, and are joined by a thin portion of the neural arch called the pars interarticularis. In between each pair of vertebrae are two small holes called <b>intervertebral</b> foramina. The spinal nerves leave the spinal cord through these holes.|$|E
25|$|Back pain* in dogs, {{particularly}} in long-backed breeds, such as Basset Hounds and Dachshunds, is usually caused by <b>intervertebral</b> disk disease. It {{is caused by}} degeneration and protrusion of the disk and compression of the spinal cord. It occurs most commonly in the cervical and thoracolumbar regions. Signs include back pain, hind limb weakness, and paralysis.|$|E
25|$|Several {{genes are}} also {{associated}} with <b>intervertebral</b> disc degeneration. Probable candidate genes like type I collagen (sp1 site), type IX collagen, vitamin D receptor, aggrecan, asporin, MMP3, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 polymorphisms have been implicated in disc degeneration. Mutation in genes coding for proteins involved in the regulation of the extracellular matrix, such as MMP2 and THBS2, has been demonstrated to contribute to lumbar disc herniation.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertebral}} column, {{also known}} as the backbone or spine, is part of the axial skeleton. The vertebral column is the defining characteristic of a vertebrate, in which the notochord (a flexible rod of uniform composition) found in all chordates {{has been replaced by a}} segmented series of bones—vertebrae separated by <b>intervertebral</b> discs. The vertebral column houses the spinal canal, a cavity that encloses and protects the spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|Axon reflex {{suggests}} that the afferent fiber is bifurcated before connecting to the dorsal horn. Bifurcated fibers do exist in muscle, skin, and <b>intervertebral</b> discs. Yet these particular neurons are rare and are not representative of the whole body. Axon-Reflex also does not explain the time delay before the appearance of referred pain, threshold differences for stimulating local and referred pain, and somatosensory sensibility changes {{in the area of}} referred pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} locations have no discs and {{are therefore}} exempt from the risk of disc herniation: the upper two cervical <b>intervertebral</b> spaces, the sacrum, and the coccyx. Most disc herniations occur {{when a person is}} in their thirties or forties when the nucleus pulposus is still a gelatin-like substance. With age the nucleus pulposus changes ("dries out") and the risk of herniation is greatly reduced. After age 50 or 60, osteoarthritic degeneration (spondylosis) or spinal stenosis are more likely causes of low back pain or leg pain.|$|E
25|$|Sciatica is {{generally}} {{caused by the}} compression of lumbar nerves L4, or L5 or sacral nerves S1, S2, or S3, or by compression of the sciatic nerve itself. When sciatica is caused by compression of a dorsal nerve root (radix), it is considered a lumbar radiculopathy (or radiculitis when accompanied with an inflammatory response). This can occur {{as a result of}} a spinal disk bulge or spinal disc herniation (a herniated <b>intervertebral</b> disc), or from roughening, enlarging, or misalignment (spondylolisthesis) of the vertebrae, or as a result of degenerated discs that can reduce the diameter of the lateral foramen (natural hole) through which nerve roots exit the spine. The <b>intervertebral</b> discs consist of an annulus fibrosus, which forms a ring surrounding the inner nucleus pulposus. When there is a tear in the anulus fibrosus, the nucleus pulposus (pulp) may extrude through the tear and press against spinal nerves within the spinal cord, cauda equina, or exiting nerve roots, causing inflammation, numbness, or excruciating pain. Inflammation of the spinal canal can also spread to adjacent facet joints and cause lower back pain and/or referred pain in the posterior thigh(s). Pseudosciatic pain can also be caused by compression of peripheral sections of the nerve, usually from soft tissue tension in the piriformis or related muscles.|$|E
25|$|Petlyuk began 2007 in good form, {{winning the}} Sparkassen Cup meet with an indoor best of 1:58.67 minutes and setting a meet record at the PSD Bank Meeting. She won a third {{straight}} Ukrainian indoor title and secured the silver {{medal at the}} 2007 European Athletics Indoor Championships, finishing second to Oksana Zbrozhek. She was a semi-finalist at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics, but persistent thigh pain dogged her season. After {{the end of the}} track and field season doctors diagnosed her with an <b>intervertebral</b> hernia, stemming from her fall in 2006.|$|E
25|$|The lumbar plexus {{is formed}} lateral to the <b>intervertebral</b> {{foramina}} by the ventral rami {{of the first}} four lumbar spinal nerves (L1-L4), which all pass through psoas major. The larger branches of the plexus exit the muscle to pass sharply downward to reach the abdominal wall and the thigh (under the inguinal ligament); {{with the exception of}} the obturator nerve which pass through the lesser pelvis to reach the medial part of the thigh through the obturator foramen. The nerves of the lumbar plexus pass in front of the hip joint and mainly support the anterior part of the thigh.|$|E
25|$|The {{idiopathic}} scoliosis {{accounts for}} 80–90% of scoliosis cases. Its pathogenesis is unknown. However, {{changes in the}} vestibular system, a lateral shift of the hand representation and abnormal variability of erector spinae motor map location in the motor cortex {{may be involved in}} this disease. Besides, idiopathic scoliosis being more frequent in certain families, it is suspected to be transmitted via autosomal dominant inheritance. Estrogens could also play a crucial part in the progression of idiopathic scoliosis through their roles in bone formation, growth, maturation and turnover. Finally, collagen, <b>intervertebral</b> disc and muscle abnormalities have been suggested as the cause in idiopathic scoliosis, although these are perhaps results rather than causes.|$|E
25|$|The {{sides of}} the {{vertebral}} column are separated from the posterior surface by the articular processes in the cervical and thoracic regions, and by the transverse processes in the lumbar region. In the thoracic region, the {{sides of the}} bodies of the vertebrae are marked in the back by the facets for articulation with the heads of the ribs. More posteriorly are the <b>intervertebral</b> foramina, formed by the juxtaposition of the vertebral notches, oval in shape, smallest in the cervical and upper part of the thoracic regions, and gradually increasing in size to the last lumbar. They transmit the special spinal nerves and are situated between the transverse processes in the cervical region, and in front of them in the thoracic and lumbar regions.|$|E
25|$|Spinal disc herniation, {{also known}} as a slipped disc, is a medical {{condition}} affecting the spine in which a tear in the outer, fibrous ring of an <b>intervertebral</b> disc allows the soft, central portion to bulge out beyond the damaged outer rings. Disc herniation is usually due to age-related degeneration of the outer ring, known as the anulus fibrosus, although trauma, lifting injuries, or straining have been implicated as well. Tears are almost always postero-lateral (on the back of the sides) owing to the presence of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the spinal canal. This tear in the disc ring may result in the release of chemicals causing inflammation, which may directly cause severe pain {{even in the absence of}} nerve root compression.|$|E
25|$|Biofilms {{have been}} found to be {{involved}} in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body, by one estimate 80% of all infections. Infectious processes in which biofilms have been implicated include common problems such as bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infections, catheter infections, middle-ear infections, formation of dental plaque, gingivitis, coating contact lenses, and less common but more lethal processes such as endocarditis, infections in cystic fibrosis, and infections of permanent indwelling devices such as joint prostheses, heart valves, and <b>intervertebral</b> disc. More recently it has been noted that bacterial biofilms may impair cutaneous wound healing and reduce topical antibacterial efficiency in healing or treating infected skin wounds. Early detection of biofilms in wounds is crucial to successful chronic wound management. Although many techniques have developed to identify planktonic bacteria in viable wounds, few have been able to quickly and accurately identify bacterial biofilms. Future studies are needed to find means of identifying and monitoring biofilm colonization at the bedside to permit timely initiation of treatment.|$|E
500|$|In {{cases where}} a more {{conservative}} approach is chosen, bed rest, cervical collars, immobilizing devices, and optionally traction are used. [...] Surgeons may opt to put traction on the spine to remove pressure from the spinal cord by putting dislocated vertebrae back into alignment, but herniation of <b>intervertebral</b> disks may prevent this technique from relieving pressure. [...] Gardner-Wells tongs are one tool used to exert spinal traction to reduce a fracture or dislocation and to immobilize the affected areas.|$|E
500|$|SCI {{can also}} be of a nontraumatic origin. Nontraumatic lesions cause {{anywhere}} from 30 to 80% of all SCI; the percentage varies by locale, influenced by efforts to prevent trauma. Developed countries have higher percentages of SCI due to degenerative conditions and tumors than developing countries. [...] In developed countries, {{the most common cause}} of nontraumatic SCI is degenerative diseases, followed by tumors; in many developing countries the leading cause is infection such as HIV and tuberculosis. SCI may occur in <b>intervertebral</b> disc disease, and spinal cord vascular disease. Spontaneous bleeding can occur within or outside of the protective membranes that line the cord, and <b>intervertebral</b> disks can herniate. Damage can result from dysfunction of the blood vessels, as in arteriovenous malformation, or when a blood clot becomes lodged in a blood vessel and cuts off blood supply to the cord. When systemic blood pressure drops, blood flow to the spinal cord may be reduced, potentially causing a loss of sensation and voluntary movement in the areas supplied by the affected level of the spinal cord. Congenital conditions and tumors that compress the cord can also cause SCI, as can vertebral spondylosis and ischemia. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that can damage the spinal cord, as can infectious or inflammatory conditions such as tuberculosis, herpes zoster or herpes simplex, meningitis, myelitis, and syphilis.|$|E
500|$|In most {{episodes of}} low back pain, a {{specific}} underlying cause is not identified or even looked for, {{with the pain}} believed {{to be due to}} mechanical problems such as muscle or joint strain. If the pain does not go away with conservative treatment or if it is accompanied by [...] "red flags" [...] such as unexplained weight loss, fever, or significant problems with feeling or movement, further testing may be needed to look for a serious underlying problem. In most cases, imaging tools such as X-ray computed tomography are not useful and carry their own risks. Despite this, the use of imaging in low back pain has increased. Some low back pain is caused by damaged <b>intervertebral</b> discs, and the straight leg raise test is useful to identify this cause. In those with chronic pain, the pain processing system may malfunction, causing large amounts of pain in response to non-serious events.|$|E
500|$|Surgery may be necessary, e.g. {{to relieve}} excess {{pressure}} on the cord, to stabilize the spine, or to put vertebrae back in their proper place. [...] In cases involving instability or compression, failing to operate can lead to worsening of the condition. Surgery is also necessary when something is pressing on the cord, such as bone fragments, blood, material from ligaments or <b>intervertebral</b> discs, or a lodged object from a penetrating injury. Although the ideal timing of surgery is still debated, {{studies have found that}} earlier surgical intervention (within 24 hours of injury) is associated with better outcomes. [...] Sometimes a patient has too many other injuries to be a surgical candidate this early. Surgery is controversial because it has potential complications (such as infection), so in cases where it is not clearly needed (e.g. the cord is being compressed), doctors must decide whether to perform surgery based on aspects of the patient's condition and their own beliefs about its risks and benefits.|$|E
500|$|Cauda equina {{syndrome}} (CES) {{results from}} a lesion below {{the level at which}} the spinal cord splits into the cauda equina, at levels L2–S5 below the conus medullaris. Thus it is not a true spinal cord syndrome since it is nerve roots that are damaged and not the cord itself; however it is common for several of these nerves to be damaged at the same time due to their proximity. CES can occur by itself or alongside conus medullaris syndrome. It can cause low back pain, weakness or paralysis in the lower limbs, loss of sensation, bowel and bladder dysfunction, and loss of reflexes. Unlike in conus medullaris syndrome, symptoms often occur on only one side of the body. The cause is often compression, e.g. by a ruptured <b>intervertebral</b> disk or tumor. [...] Since the nerves damaged in CES are actually peripheral nerves because they have already branched off from the spinal cord, the injury has better prognosis for recovery of function: the peripheral nervous system has a greater capacity for healing than the central nervous system.|$|E
