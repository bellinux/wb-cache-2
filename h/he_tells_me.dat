500|$|In late 2000, Kuntz {{decided not}} {{to return to his}} role as first-base coach and outfield instructor. Instead, {{he went back to his}} {{position}} as a roving instructor with the team, which allowed for more time to be spent with his family. At that time, Marlins players including Cliff Floyd and Mark Kotsay praised Kuntz for the amount of preparation that he put into his coaching. Kotsay gave Kuntz credit for the stolen bases he had accrued. Floyd said, [...] ""I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm telling you, he's meant everything. <b>He</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> about every pitcher we're facing. He keeps me going when I'm down. You don't get that too often in this game. You're expected just to be strong, handle everything. But it ain't that easy sometimes. He's a players' man. He loves us." ...|$|E

[...] "Retrospect for Life", produced by James Poyser and No I.D. featuring Lauryn Hill (who was due on the same day as Rashid's girlfriend), is the song that is the driving force behind the project.

2500|$|The wider U.S. {{economy was}} soon {{hit by the}} effects of the Trent crisis. On December 16, the actions of the British cabinet reached New York: the stock {{exchange}} fell across the board, with government securities dropping by 2.5 per cent and the sterling exchange rising by two points, and an overall suspension seemed imminent. On December 20, Salmon P. Chase's broker refused to sell some of the secretary's holdings of railway stock because they were almost worthless, and informed him that the business community [...] "trust you will have allayed this excitement with England: one war at a time is enough". A run on New York banks followed the stock market troubles, with $17,000,000 being withdrawn in three weeks, and on December 30 the banks voted by 25-15 to suspend specie payments. Banks across the country soon followed them, with only those of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky continuing to redeem in coin. This suspension left the Treasury unable to pay its suppliers, contractors or soldiers. Though the crisis was resolved soon afterwards, these difficulties were not: on January 10, Lincoln asked Quartermaster General Meigs [...] "General, what shall I do? The people are impatient; Chase has no money, and <b>he</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> he can raise no more; the General of the Armies has typhoid fever. The bottom is out of the tub. What shall I do?"
