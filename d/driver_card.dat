5000|$|A {{tachograph}} system comprises a {{sender unit}} mounted {{to the vehicle}} gearbox, the tachograph head and a recording medium. Tachograph heads are of either analogue or digital types. All relevant vehicles manufactured in the EU since 1 May 2006 must be fitted with digital tachograph heads. The recording medium for analogue heads are wax coated paper discs, and for digital heads there are two recording mediums: internal memory (which can be read out with one {{of a variety of}} download devices into a so-called [...]ddd file) and digital <b>driver</b> <b>cards</b> containing a microchip with flash memory. Digital <b>driver</b> <b>cards</b> store data in a format that can later also be read out as a [...]ddd file. These files - both those read from internal memory with a download device, and those read from the <b>driver</b> <b>cards</b> - can be imported into tachograph analysis/archival software.|$|R

50|$|In some cases, {{when the}} {{electronics}} {{of the trailer}} (especially the ABS sensors in the wheels) get wet, the brake pedal would not operate as normal, and even the slightest touch {{would result in a}} wheel-lock. There are problems with the calculation of the mileage available for the remaining fuel. Cases have been reported when the fuel has run out with the computer showing 25 more miles to go. Also, the statistics of average speed and fuel consumption are prone to failure when driving a digital tachograph truck without a <b>driver</b> <b>card.</b> This problem has now been solved by a software update from Mercedes. The Powershift transmission has also had a clutch kit/pressure plate failure issue with a recall in late 2009 some trucks have had further clutch cylinder failures with no remuneration from the manufacturer.|$|E

The first usable Unix driver has been written and produces single-action CAMAC cycles from test software.

40|$|AbstractAn Insertable B-Layer {{is planned}} for the upgrade of the ATLAS {{detector}} and will add a fourth and innermost pixel layer to the existing Pixel Detector. 12 million pixels attached to new FE-I 4 readout ASICs will require new off-detector electronics which is currently realized with two VME-based boards: a Back Of Crate module implementing optical I/O functionality and a Readout Driver module for data processing. This paper illustrates the new readout chain, focusing {{on the design of}} the new Readout <b>Driver</b> <b>Card,</b> which, with a fourfold integration with respect to the previous design, builds up the detector data, controls the calibration procedures and interacts via Gigabit links with a novel calibration farm. Future prospects and back compatibility to the existing system are also addressed...|$|E
40|$|Dead-time is {{introduced}} between the gating {{signals to the}} top and bottom switches in a voltage source inverter (VSI) leg, to prevent shoot through fault due to the finite turn-off times of IGBTs. The dead-time results in a delay when the incoming device is an IGBT, resulting in error voltage pulses in the inverter output voltage. This paper presents the design, fabrication and testing of an advanced gate driver, which eliminates dead-time and consequent output distortion. Here, the gating pulses are generated such that the incoming IGBT transition is not delayed and shoot-through is also prevented. The various logic units of the <b>driver</b> <b>card</b> and fault tolerance of the driver are verified through extensive tests on different topologies such as chopper, half-bridge and full-bridge inverter, and also at different conditions of load. Experimental results demonstrate the improvement in the load current waveform quality with the proposed circuit, on account of elimination of dead-time...|$|E
40|$|The Level- 1 Data <b>Driver</b> <b>Card</b> (L 1 DDC) was {{designed}} {{for the needs of}} the future upgrades of the innermost stations of the ATLAS end-cap muon spectrometer. The L 1 DDC is a high speed aggregator board capable of communicating with multiple front-end electronic boards. It collects the Level- 1 data along with monitoring data and transmits them to a network interface through bidirectional and/or unidirectional fiber links at 4. 8 Gbps each. In addition, the L 1 DDC board distributes trigger, time and configuration data coming from the network interface to the front-end boards. The L 1 DDC is fully compatible with the Phase II upgrade where the trigger rate is expected to reach the 1 MHz. Three different types of L 1 DDC boards will be fabricated handling up to 10. 080 Gbps of user data. It consist of custom made radiation tolerant ASICs: the GigaBit Transceiver (GBTx), the FEAST DC-DC converter, the Slow Control Adapter (SCA), and the Versatile Tranceivers (VTRX) and transmitters (VTTX). The overall scheme of the data acquisition process and in particular the L 1 DDC board will be described. The results from the various system integration and radiation tests will be presented...|$|E

50|$|The Univac 1830, Navy {{designated}} CP-823/U, was {{a digital}} electronic computing machine which received problems and data and processed answers in numerical form. It used parallel binary arithmetic and logic operations; word length was 30 bits. All of the Central Processor (C.P.) logic and I/O logic control was microelectronic circuitry, constructed of integrated, monolithic semiconductor elements (resistors, {{diodes and transistors}} contained within a single chip of silicon).

In 7503, the screen updates involved the processor specifying a screen {{address to the}} display <b>driver</b> <b>cards,</b> and then firing a sequence of characters to be stored in consecutive locations starting at the specified address. The display driver hardware included hardware registers to track where the next character was to be placed. In 7502, the display memory {{was part of the}} processors normal memory space. This meant that the processor could read or write any screen location directly.|$|R
