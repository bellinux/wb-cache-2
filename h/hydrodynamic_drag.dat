5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E

The two center shafts were housed in skegs, which while increasing <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>drag,</b> substantially strengthened the stern structure.|$|E
2500|$|In fluid dynamics, {{the drag}} {{coefficient}} (commonly denoted as: , [...] or [...] ) is a dimensionless quantity {{that is used}} to quantify the drag or resistance of an object in a fluid environment, such as air or water. It is used in the drag equation in which a lower drag coefficient indicates the object will have less aerodynamic or <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>drag.</b> The drag coefficient is always associated with a particular surface area.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{experiments}} with the beach seine model are described. Two experiments have been made. During the experiment the tension of the wings and <b>hydrodynamic</b> force of <b>drag</b> have been measured with the strain-gauge transducer. According to the {{results of the}} experiments graphs demonstrating the dependence of the forces on the model shape, have been made. The model shape is described by the ratio of bending deflection to the distance between the wings of the beach seine. In the first experiment, the parameters were changing with the movement of the both wings, in the second experiment one wing was fixed at one point and the shape was changing with the movement of the other wing. With the growth of this ratio the tension of the wings and the <b>hydrodynamic</b> force of <b>drag</b> of the model were declining...|$|R
2500|$|Most suits have {{relatively}} baggy trouser legs to allow {{passage of the}} feet to the boots. This can hold a large volume of air when inverted, which may pull the boots off the feet. Elastic or tailored [...] "gaiters" [...] can be pulled snug around the lower legs to reduce the potential airspace to help prevent an inversion event and help maintain horizontal trim. Gaiters may also reduce <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>drag</b> when finning, {{reduce the risk of}} the feet pulling out of the boots when inverted, and can be used effectively on membrane and neoprene suits. Ankle straps perform a similar function. Small ankle-weights (typically one or two pounds) can also be used with any dry suit, both to provide trim weight {{at the bottom of the}} suit, and function as short gaiters to constrict the ankle region of suit once the foot is in the boot. Ankle-weights have to be accelerated and decelerated along with the fins during every kick, which requires more energy from the diver. Gaiters do not have this drawback as they are typically very light and approximately neutral buoyancy.|$|E

40|$|Morphogenesis {{is central}} to biology but remains largely {{unexplored}} in chemistry. Reaction-diffusion (RD) mechanisms are, however, essential to understand how shape emerges in the living world. While numerical methods confirm the incredible potential of RD mechanisms to generate patterns, their experimental implementation, despite great efforts, has yet to surpass the paradigm of stationary Turing patterns achieved 25 years ago. The principal reason for our difficulty to synthesize arbitrary concentration patterns from scratch {{is the lack of}} fully programmable reaction-diffusion systems. To solve this problem we introduce here a DNA-based system where kinetics and diffusion can be individually tuned. We demonstrate the capability to precisely control reaction-diffusion properties with an autocatalytic network that propagates in a one-dimensional reactor with uniform velocity, typically 100 μm min- 1. The diffusion coefficient of the propagating species can be reduced up to a factor 2. 7 using a species-specific strategy relying on self-assembled <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>drags.</b> Our approach is modular as we illustrate by designing three alternative front generating systems, two of which can pass through each other with little interaction. Importantly, the strategies to control kinetics and diffusion are orthogonal to each other resulting in simple programming rules. Our results can be quantitatively predicted from first-principle RD equations and are in excellent agreement with a generalized Fisher- Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piscunov analytical model. Together, these advances open the way for the rational engineering of far-from-equilibrium arbitrary patterns and could lead to the synthesis of self-organizing materials...|$|R

2500|$|The wind, {{current and}} waves {{make up the}} balance of forces for any {{drifting}} object. Sufficient information of these forces {{as well as the}} shape of the drifting object should yield the correct resultant drift of the object. Richardson (1997) and Breivik and Allen (2008) noted that there are aerodynamic and <b>hydrodynamic</b> lift and <b>drag</b> components of the wind and current on the parts of the object exposed to the air and current. Figures 1 & 2 depict the various leeway components. [...] The larger component of leeway drift is the downwind component, which is comparable to the <b>hydrodynamic</b> and aerodynamic <b>drag.</b> It is critical to include the component of drift that is perpendicular to the downwind component called the crosswind component of leeway drift, which is comparable to the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic lift. The crosswind component causes the drift object to diverge from straight downwind direction. The leeway divergence depends upon the search object as well as the environment. Furthermore, the initial orientation of the object relative to the wind will change the path of the object. It is unknown whether the search object will diverge to the right or left of the downwind direction therefore the range of values of leeway divergence is important in determining the actual trajectory.|$|R

40|$|Several {{mathematical}} {{models have}} been proposed for calculating fuel rod responses in axial flows based on a single rod consideration. The spacing between fuel rods in liquid metal fast breeder reactors is small; hence fuel rods will {{interact with one another}} due to fluid coupling. The objective {{of this paper is to}} study the coupled vibration of fuel bundles. To account for the fluid coupling, a computer code, AMASS, is developed to calculate added mass coefficients for a group of circular cylinders based on the potential flow theory. The equations of motion for rod bundles are then derived including <b>hydrodynamic</b> forces, <b>drag</b> forces, fluid pressure, gravity effect, axial tension, and damping. Based on the equations, a method of analysis is presented to study the free and forced vibrations of rod bundles. Finally, the method is applied to a typical LMFBR fuel bundle consisting of seven rods...|$|R

40|$|The {{adsorption}} of {{a single}} polymer to a flat surface in shear is investigated using Brownian hydrodynamics simulations and scaling arguments. Competing effects are disentangled: {{in the absence of}} <b>hydrodynamic</b> interactions, shear <b>drag</b> flattens the chain and thus enhances adsorption. Hydrodynamic lift on the other hand gives rise to long-ranged repulsion from the surface which preempts the surface-adsorbed state via a discontinuous desorption transition, in agreement with theoretical arguments. Chain flattening is dominated by hydrodynamic lift, so overall, shear flow weakens the adsorption of flexible polymers. Surface friction due to small-wavelength surface potential corrugations is argued to weaken the surface attraction as well. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

Modern analysis employs fluid mechanics and aerodynamics airflow calculations for sail design and manufacture, using aeroelasticity models, which combine computational fluid dynamics and structural analysis. Secondary effects pertaining to turbulence and separation of the boundary layer are secondary factors. Computational limitations persist. Theoretical results require empirical confirmation with wind tunnel tests on scale models and full scale testing of sails.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mathematical modeling and numerical methodology performed {{prior to the}} prototype deployment of the AquaBuOY, {{one of the few}} wave energy devices that have reached the ocean deployment stage. The combination of numerical computations, and laboratory testing produced some encouraging findings about how the AquaBuOY responds to real wave conditions. However, it also highlighted deficiencies in some of the early modeling, which emphasized the need for a time domain model in realistic wave conditions that includes accurate <b>hydrodynamic</b> and <b>drag</b> coefficients. This paper focuses on the governing equations that model the vertical dynamics of the AquaBuOY and the numerical solutions of these equations in order to predict the absorbed power of the device. Numerical results are presented in the time domain for both regular and irregular wave regimes (realistic wave conditions) as well as compared to experimental data in a regular wave regime. While the two body system is challenging to model, due to the inclusion of variables such as the wave forcing term as well as identifying the non linear damping term along with a linear spring term needed to model the power takeoff system, it does provide a robust tool for wave energy research. ...|$|R

40|$|Lung {{epithelial}} cells {{are subjected to}} large cyclic forces from breathing. However, their response to dynamic stresses is poorly defined. We measured the complex shear modulus (G*(ω)) of human alveolar (A 549) and bronchial (BEAS- 2 B) {{epithelial cells}} over three frequency decades (0. 1 – 100 Hz) and at different loading forces (0. 1 – 0. 9 nN) with atomic force microscopy. G*(ω) was computed by correcting force-indentation oscillatory data for the tip-cell contact geometry and for the <b>hydrodynamic</b> viscous <b>drag.</b> Both cell types displayed similar viscoelastic properties. The storage modulus G′(ω) increased with frequency following a power law with exponent ∼ 0. 2. The loss modulus G″(ω) was ∼ 2 / 3 lower and increased similarly to G′(ω) up to ∼ 10 Hz, but exhibited a steeper rise at higher frequencies. The cells showed a weak force dependence of G′(ω) and G″(ω). G*(ω) conformed to the power-law model with a structural damping coefficient of ∼ 0. 3, indicating a coupling of elastic and dissipative processes within the cell. Power-law behavior implies a continuum distribution of stress relaxation time constants. This complex dynamics {{is consistent with the}} rheology of soft glassy materials close to a glass transition, thereby suggesting that structural disorder and metastability may be fundamental features of cell architecture. ...|$|R
40|$|Using slender-body hydrodynamics in the inertialess limit, {{we examine}} the motion of Purcell’s swimmer, a planar, fore–aft-symmetric three-link {{flagellum}} or propulsive mechanism that translates by alternately moving its front and rear segments. Purcell (1976) concluded via symmetry arguments that the net displacement of such a swimmer must follow a straight line, but the direction and other details of the motion have never been investigated. Numerical {{results indicate that the}} direction of net translation and the speed of Purcell’s swimmer depend on the angular amplitude of the swimming strokes {{as well as on the}} relative length of the links. Analytical results are presented for small rotations about the straightened configuration, and physical arguments are given to qualitatively explain the propulsive dynamics. The optimal swimmer configurations under the conditions of constant forcing and of minimum mechanical work are determined. We use a definition of efficiency based on the straightened configuration as a reference state to compare Purcell’s swimmer with the previously treated swimming motions of an undulating rod and a rotating helix. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of the anisotropy in the local <b>hydrodynamic</b> slender-body <b>drag</b> to swimming motions at low Reynolds number by showing that, in general, any inextensible swimmer in an otherwise quiescent fluid cannot alter its average position under conditions of locally isotropic drag...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} the {{mechanism}} limiting the velocity of ATP-induced unidirectional movements of actin-myosin filaments in vitro is considered. In the sliding process two types of "cyclic" interactions between myosin heads and actin are involved, i. e., productive and nonproductive. In the productive interaction, myosin heads split ATP and generate a force which produces sliding between actin and myosin. In the nonproductive interaction "cycle," on the other hand, myosin heads rapidly attach to and detach from actin "reversibly," i. e., without splitting ATP or generating an active force. Such a nonproductive interaction "cycle" causes irreversible dissipation of sliding energy into heat, because the myosin cross-bridges during this interaction are passive elastic structures. This consideration has led us to postulate that such cross-bridges, in effect, exert viscous-like frictional drag on moving elements. Energetic considerations suggest that this frictional drag {{is much greater than}} the <b>hydrodynamic</b> viscous <b>drag.</b> We present a model in which the sliding velocity is limited by the balance between the force generated by myosin cross-bridges in the productive interaction and the frictional drag exerted by other myosin cross-bridges in the nonproductive interaction. The model is consistent with experimental findings of in vitro sliding, including the dependence of velocity on ATP concentration, as well as the sliding velocity of co-polymers of skeletal muscle myosin and phosphorylated and unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosins...|$|R
