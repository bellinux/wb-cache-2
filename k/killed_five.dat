5|$|The Miami and Pottawatomie nations {{returned}} to Indiana following the war.

These four nations were later to be participants in the Sixty Years' War, a struggle between native nations and European settlers {{for control of the}} Great Lakes region.

5|$|The {{hurricane}} threatened {{large portions}} of the western coastline of Mexico, resulting in the evacuation {{of tens of thousands}} of people. In coastal portions of western Mexico, strong winds downed trees, while heavy rain resulted in mudslides. Hurricane John caused moderate damage on the Baja California peninsula, including the destruction of more than 200houses and thousands of flimsy shacks. The hurricane <b>killed</b> <b>five</b> people in Mexico, and damage totaled $663million (2006MXN, $60.8million 2006USD). In the southwest United States, moisture from the remnants of John produced heavy rainfall. The rainfall aided drought conditions in portions of northern Texas, although it was detrimental in locations that had received above-normal rainfall throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{day of the}} siege the gunmen had become {{increasingly}} frustrated {{at the lack of}} progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the Special Air Service (SAS), a special forces regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault—Operation Nimrod—to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers abseiled from the roof of the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued {{all but one of the}} remaining hostages, and <b>killed</b> <b>five</b> of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean, at {{its second}} landfall, dropped 4 to 8in (100 to 200mm) of {{rainfall}} across {{the western states}} of Jalisco and Nayarit. This rainfall trigged a mudslide in Jalisco which fell on 10houses and killed one of the occupants. Landslides in Puebla <b>killed</b> <b>five</b> people, and another was crushed when a wall in his house collapsed. One person in Veracruz was electrocuted after touching a power line while repairing his roof. In Michoacán, as the outer bands of the storm swept over the state, a man sheltering under a tree was struck by lightning. Two women died in Hidalgo when heavy rain collapsed their house's roof. Another man drowned while trying to cross a rain-swollen river in Tlacolula, Oaxaca. The heavy rains caused dozens of smaller landslides throughout the country, particularly in Veracruz and Tabasco, {{but most of them}} caused no fatalities. At least 50,000houses were damaged to varying degrees throughout the country. Although Dean's rains caused flooding as far inland as Mexico City, where they closed a portion of Puebla-Mexico highway, the damage was concentrated in the states of Quintana Roo and Veracruz.|$|E
5|$|In August 1944 {{advancing}} Soviet {{troops had}} reached the Soviet border with East Prussia and by 31 August of that year Shanina's battle count reached 42 kills.

She returned to the front on 17 October for one day, and later received an honourable certificate from the Central Committee of Komsomol.

5|$|In Kyushu, {{the heavy}} {{rainfall}} caused flooding and landslides, which buried several houses in Miyazaki Prefecture and forced 75people to evacuate. The high wind knocked over many cypress or cedar trees, totaling 22529ha (55,670acres) and accounting for ¥64billion ($530million USD) in damage in Ōita Prefecture alone. Damage was heaviest near Nagasaki, where 16people were killed, including five after a warehouse collapsed during the storm. A construction worker in nearby Isahaya {{was killed when}} the winds struck him with a prebuilt hut, and airborne debris <b>killed</b> <b>five</b> people in Kumamoto Prefecture and seven in Fukuoka Prefecture.
