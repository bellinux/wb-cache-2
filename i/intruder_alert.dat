The displays that showed <b>intruder</b> <b>alert</b> information in altitude and heading bands had significantly fewer losses of well clear compared with alternative displays that lacked that information. This difference was significant from a statistical and practical perspective: those losses that did occur lasted for shorter periods and did not penetrate as far into the geometric "separation cylinder" as those in the non-banded displays. A modest level of DAA surveillance sensor uncertainty did not affect the proportion of losses of well clear or their severity. It is recommended that DAA traffic displays implement a band-type display in order to improve the safety of UAS operations in the National Airspace System.

40|$|Abstract – Protecting {{data from}} the intruders on {{internet}} or on the host systems is a very tedious task. The Intrusion Detection System is a technology for detecting suspicious actions or malicious behavior in a system from the unauthorized users or so called <b>intruders.</b> <b>Alerts</b> are produced during the intrusion activity, but when more number of alerts is produced then handling of these alerts becomes difficult on IDS. In this paper, we propose a layered approach for IDS where the alert information is represented dynamically {{in the form of}} layers and we propose an alert aggregation algorithm where an attack instance is created for similar type of alerts produced and this is clustered to form a meta-alert which can reduce the number of alerts produced without losing any information. This technique has approaches like generative modeling, in this case the beginning as well as the completion of attack properties and details can be detected and it is a data stream approach, where duplicate or the alerts which are observed many number of times are processed only a few times. By applying these techniques and alert aggregation we can reduce the number of false alert rate and number of alerts. The goal of the project is to generate meta-alerts from the proposed alert aggregation algorithm and represent all the alert information or the intruder activity on a dynamically representing model. The alert produced and the details of the alert and the action taken are represented in the form of layers on a distinctive layered model. The details of the alert are represented using these layers and further to form a meta-alert. Meta-alerts contain all the relevant information but the amount of data can be reduced progressively. Using the data sets, it is possible {{to reduce the number of}} alerts produced while number of missing meta-alerts is extremely low and represent all the alert information in the form of layers on a model...|$|R

In distributed warfare, typically small teams of warfighters operate in remote and austere environments on their own with limited support from outside.

For operations that last over several days, even the most highly trained teams are vulnerable to fatigue, leading to a loss of focus during long periods of boring activities such as night watch.

We are building a sensor grid around the team by networking several mobile phones using Bluetooth and using their built-in components such as accelerometers to capture seismic signals and microphone to capture sound in the area. When the grid is entered by a human, animal or machine, the individual phones capture signals generated by the intruders’ movements.

40|$|A SEA Swarm (Sensor Equipped Aquatic Swarm) is a {{collection}} of mobile underwater sensors that moves as a group with water current and enables 4 D (space and time) monitoring of local underwater events such as contaminants and <b>intruders.</b> For prompt <b>alert</b> reporting, mobile sensors routes events to mobile sinks (i. e., autonomous underwater vehicles) via geographic routing that is known to be most efficient under mobility and scarce acoustic bandwidth. In order for a packet to be routed to the destination using geographical routing, it requires to know the location of the destination. This is accomplished by having a location service that returns the location of a requested node. Our goal is to design such location service for SEA Swarm. In this paper, we analyze various design choices to realize an efficient location service in SEA Swarm scenarios. We find that conventional ad hoc network location service protocols cannot be directly used, because the entire swarm moves along water current. We prove that maintaining location information in a 2 D plane is a better design choice. Given this, we propose a bio-inspired location service called a Phero-Trail location service protocol. In Phero-Trail, location information is stored in a 2 D upper hull of a SEA Swarm, and a mobile sink uses its trajectory (a ̀ la a pheromone trail of ants) projected to the 2 D hull to maintain location information.

This paper describes a capability called Java Architecture for Detect and Avoid Extensibility and Modeling (JADEM), developed to prototype and help evaluate various DAA technological requirements by providing a flexible and extensible software platform that models all major detect-and-avoid functions. Figure 1 illustrates JADEM's architecture. The surveillance module can be actual equipment on the unmanned aircraft or simulators that model the process by which sensors on-board detect other aircraft and provide track data to the traffic display. The track evaluation function evaluates each detected aircraft and decides whether to provide an alert to the pilot and its severity. Guidance is a combination of <b>intruder</b> track information, <b>alerting,</b> and avoidance/advisory algorithms behind the tools shown on the traffic display to aid the pilot in determining a maneuver to avoid a loss of well clear. All these functions are designed with a common interface and configurable implementation, which is critical in exploring DAA requirements. To date, JADEM has been utilized in three computer simulations of the National Airspace System, three pilot-in-the-loop experiments using a total of 37 professional UAS pilots, and two flight tests using NASA's Predator-B unmanned aircraft, named Ikhana. The data collected has directly informed the quantitative separation standard for "well clear", safety case, requirements development, and the operational environment for the DAA minimum operational performance standards.
