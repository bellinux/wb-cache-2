5|$|According to legend, Varanasi {{was founded}} by the god Shiva. There {{happened}} a fight between the two supreme gods, Brahma and Shiva, and the succeeding combat resulted {{in one of the}} five heads of Brahma being torn off by Shiva. It was a custom of the time that the victor carried the slain adversary’s head in his hand and let it hang down from <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> an act of ignominy and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. The land of Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy religious site.|$|E
5|$|Amelia visits Meredith to {{apologize}} for her prior behavior and discuss her sobriety. Amelia confides in Meredith that she is scared to lose her, but Meredith responds {{that she is not}} ready to forgive her. Webber takes Meredith out for some fresh air, and gives her a talk about the power of forgiveness. He encourages her to forgive Amelia, Penny, Derek, and most importantly herself. She agrees to meet Lou. He introduces his wife and two daughters and then offers a sincere apology for what happened. Meredith, still unable to speak, takes <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> a way of conveying her forgiveness.|$|E
5|$|Bell {{was then}} an {{employee}} of the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia. At one point, he tried <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, $) during the Wall Street Crash of 1929. His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz. From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team. In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.|$|E

5|$|Dark Gaia then attacks Sonic and Chip, but Chip protects Sonic {{and calls}} {{all of the}} Gaia temples {{together}} to form the Gaia Colossus and fight Dark Gaia. The Gaia Colussus seemingly destroys Dark Gaia, but Dark Gaia is not finished with them or the Earth yet, and consumes the entire world in darkness, becoming Perfect Dark Gaia in the process. Chip then gives the restored Chaos Emeralds to Sonic, allowing him to turn into Super Sonic and destroy it; Dark Gaia then sinks back into the planet, but the battle takes its toll on Super Sonic. Chip saves Sonic by throwing him to the surface, before returning himself {{to the inside of}} the planet; he leaves behind his necklace and some parting words. Sonic places the necklace on <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> a bracelet to remind him of their adventure together before speeding off with Tails, flying alongside him on the coastline in the Tornado plane.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Baroš {{was accused}} of making a racist gesture towards his Cameroonian {{opponent}} Stéphane Mbia during Lyon's match against Rennes on 18 April. After having been fouled by Mbia several times, Baroš held his nose in front of Mbia and waved <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> if to waft away an unpleasant smell. In the ensuing controversy, Baroš insisted that his gesture {{was not intended to}} be racist in any way, and he was only trying to tell Mbia to get out of his face and leave him alone. Baroš and Mbia were brought before an official disciplinary hearing of the Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP), which ruled that Baroš was innocent of racist behaviour, but he was nevertheless suspended for the remaining three games of the season for unsportsmanlike conduct. The end of the season saw Lyon win the league title, but nonetheless manager Houllier left the club.|$|E
5|$|Lexie's death devastates Meredith, who {{is still}} desperately trying to find her husband. Eventually, she and Shepherd reunite and they fix <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> best as they can. Meanwhile, back at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, no one is aware of what has {{happened}} to the other doctors. Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) prepares the annual dinner for the departing residents, which Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams), and Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) are dreading. Avery makes the choice to take a job offer at Tulane Medical Center, and he and Kepner share a moment. Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) decide to get married, even though Warren is going to start his surgical internship in Los Angeles. After realizing Dr. Teddy Altman (Kim Raver) was offered a chief position at United States Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) and is refusing to leave Seattle out of loyalty, Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), the chief of surgery, fires her to free her from the hospital where her husband died. As the episode ends, Hunt picks up his messages to discover the surgical team never made it to Boise. The residents, finally excited to celebrate at Webber's dinner, are left waiting for their stranded friends. The remaining crash survivors are left struggling to stay awake as their last match goes out. In the closing monologue, Meredith repeats the opening to the speech that Webber gave in the pilot episode of the series.|$|E

5|$|The {{year after}} he left office as mayor, Armstrong began work with the Edmonton post office. After being {{recommended}} for the position by city notables, he was named postmaster of the city on November 12, 1913. In the same year he oversaw {{the construction of a}} new building on Namayo Avenue, the Fairbairn Block, mainly for use by his business but with additional space for offices and housing in the upper levels. In 1920, Armstrong was involved in a legal case involving his office as postmaster when he was accused in the 1919 disappearance of a sum of $50,000 from the post office. Although exonerated in 1920, he would again be arrested in 1923 and charged with theft. During the trial, it was testified that a witness had seen Armstrong on the day of the robbery, with only a paper in <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> if he were heading out. Armstrong, who had proclaimed his innocence, and provided evidence for the trial was eventually acquitted and found not guilty of the charges in a decision made on May 29, which was followed by an eruption of applause. Later in 1923, Armstrong was appointed postmaster of the Strathcona (south side) Post Office. He remained with the post office until he retired in January 1937. At the time of his retirement he was serving as postmaster of the south post office. In his years with the post office, he served a total of 14 years as postmaster. The Armstrong Drug Store would later go through multiple owners until its closing on December 10, 1993.|$|E

25|$|In league games, a fixed {{number of}} points is added for each game that is won by the declarer to lower the chance factor and to stress the skill factor. In that situation, it becomes far more {{important}} for each player to bid <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> high as possible.|$|E
25|$|Returning to the United States, {{he again}} took up {{residence}} in San Francisco. From 1879 to 1880, he traveled to Rockerville and Deadwood in the Dakota Territory, to try <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> local manager for a New York mining company. When the company failed he returned to San Francisco and resumed his career in journalism.|$|E
25|$|As 1923 {{turned into}} 1924, Sibelius was distracted {{from his work}} on the symphony by a number of outside events: the award of a large cash prize from a Helsinki foundation, family birthdays and the {{composition}} of a number of brief piano works. When he returned to the symphony, the composer drank copious amounts of whisky in order, he claimed, to steady <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> he wrote on the manuscript paper.|$|E

25|$|Though Webb's {{shipbuilding}} {{career had}} come to an end, he was still only 53 years of age and had accumulated a large fortune. He now began to try <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> a financier, helping to organize a successful South American guano company, and attempting less successfully to profit from a shipping line to Nicaragua, the Central American Transit Company. He also made considerable investments in real estate, one result of which was the construction of a Hotel, the Bristol, at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Lancelot, {{separated}} from Arthur and Bedevere, is {{arrested by the}} police who are investigating the historian's murder. Arthur and Bedevere travel to the Castle Aarrgh, which they find occupied by the French forces that taunted them earlier.

Arthur and Bedevere are arrested, {{and one of the}} officers covers the lens with <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>as</b> the film appears to break in the projector.|$|E
25|$|Later on, Martin Bormann {{interrupts}} {{a meeting}} between Hitler, Goebbels, and Walther Hewel to read a message from Luftwaffe chief Hermann Göring requesting permission to assume command and become head-of-state. Hitler responds by stripping Göring of his rank, ordering his arrest, and naming Robert Ritter von Greim as his replacement. Hitler then receives further upsetting news when Speer informs him that he has defied Hitler's scorched earth policy orders. Hitler does not punish Speer, {{but he does not}} shake <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> Speer leaves.|$|E

25|$|Tetraplegic Matt Nagle {{became the}} first person to control an {{artificial}} hand using a BCI in 2005 as part of the first nine-month human trial of Cyberkinetics’s BrainGate chip-implant. Implanted in Nagle’s right precentral gyrus (area of the motor cortex for arm movement), the 96-electrode BrainGate implant allowed Nagle to control a robotic arm by thinking about moving <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> well as a computer cursor, lights and TV. One year later, professor Jonathan Wolpaw received the prize of the Altran Foundation for Innovation to develop a Brain Computer Interface with electrodes located {{on the surface of the}} skull, instead of directly in the brain.|$|E
25|$|During {{the filming}} of The Bread and Alley in 1970, Kiarostami had major {{differences}} with his experienced cinematographer about how to film {{the boy and the}} attacking dog. While the cinematographer wanted separate shots of the boy approaching, a close-up of <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>as</b> he enters the house and closes the door, followed by a shot of the dog, Kiarostami believed that if the three scenes could be captured as a whole it would have a more profound impact in creating tension over the situation. That one shot took around forty days to complete, until Kiarostami was fully content with the scene. Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes would have disrupted the rhythm and content of the film's structure, preferring to let the scene flow as one.|$|E
25|$|At this point, Krishna, {{observing the}} fight, {{calls out to}} Bhima and signals him by {{repeatedly}} clapping his own thigh with <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> <b>As</b> intended, Bhima was reminded of an oath he had taken after the game of dice to crush Duryodhana's thighs. Bhima viciously attacks Duryodhana with a mace and strikes his thigh, mortally wounding Duryodhana. After having his face insultingly kicked by Bhima, Duryodhana bemoans that he was slain by unfair means, given that it was illegal to attack below the waist. Infuriated at the violation, Balarama, the brother of Lord Krishna, raises his weapon in attack. Lord Krishna consoles Balarama, by reminding him of Duryodhana's evil deeds. Relenting but fuming, Balarama curses Bhima to be known {{in the world as}} a crooked warrior and blesses Duryodhana with glory, naming Duryodhana his greatest pupil.|$|E
