25|$|X# {{can work}} with three {{low-level}} data structures: the registers, the stack and the memory, on different ports. The registers are the base of all normal operations for X#. A register can be copied to another by writing DST = SRC as opposed to mov or load/store instructions. Registers can be incremented or <b>decremented</b> just as easily. Arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) are written as dest op src where src is a constant, variable, or register, and dest is both an operand and the location where the result is stored.|$|E
25|$|Branch {{instructions}} have a 6-bit opcode field, a 5-bit Ra {{field and}} a 21-bit displacement field. The Ra field specifies a register {{to be tested}} by a conditional branch instruction, and if the condition is met, the program counter is updated by adding {{the contents of the}} displacement field with the program counter. The displacement field contains a signed integer and if the value of the integer is positive, if the branch is taken then the program counter is incremented. If the value of the integer is negative, then program counter is <b>decremented</b> if the branch is taken. The range of a branch thus is ±1 Mi instructions, or ±4 MiB. The Alpha Architecture was designed with a large range as part of the architecture's forward-looking goal.|$|E
500|$|Mother 3 {{retains the}} turn-based battle system {{featured}} in EarthBound. When the player comes {{into contact with}} an enemy in the overworld, the game transitions to a battle screen. Battles are viewed from a first-person perspective, showing the enemies against a distorted, animated background. The player can assign each character in their party to perform an action, such as attacking an enemy or using items to restore HP or PP. Some characters can utilize psychic-based abilities referred to as PSI, which includes stronger attacks and healing abilities, and require PP to execute. Like EarthBound, combat uses a [...] "rolling health" [...] system: {{when one of the}} player's characters is injured, its HP will gradually [...] "roll" [...] down, similar to an odometer, rather than immediately <b>decremented.</b> This allows a mortally wounded character to perform actions like attacking or healing themselves, as long as the player acts quickly enough. If a character loses all HP, it will become unconscious and cannot participate unless revived by another character. The player loses a battle if all characters become unconscious; the player will then be given the option to continue play from the nearest save point, but with half the DP on their person.|$|E

Francesco Panetta, Salvatore Antibo and Vainio started their pursuit a little bit later and were not able to properly challenge Kipkoech. Subsequently, Kipkoech was far ahead of the other runners and the officials <b>decremented</b> the lap table, which displays the remaining laps for the runners, immediately after Kipkoech passed the finish line after each round. As a result, Vainio and some other runners became confused about the remaining laps, started their sprint 400 metres too early and finished the race after 9600 metres. Some runners continued the race after their [...] "first finish", but Vainio was too tired to realize the situation. Vainio also competed in the Marathon, but after a fairly good start he did not finish.

40|$|Abstract—The aim of {{this study}} was to test whether the Attention Networks Test (ANT) showed {{temporal}} <b>decrements</b> in performance. Vigilance tasks typically show such <b>decrements,</b> which may reflect impairments in executive control resulting from cognitive fatigue. The ANT assesses executive control, as well as alerting and orienting. Thus, it was hypothesized that ANT executive control would deteriorate over time. Manipulations including task condition (trial composition) and masking were included in the experimental design in an attempt to increase performance <b>decrements.</b> However, results showed that there is no temporal <b>decrement</b> on the ANT. The roles of task demands, cognitive fatigue and participant motivation in producing this result are discussed.

40|$|Hydrogen {{recombination}} emission lines commonly {{observed in}} accreting young stellar objects represent a powerful tracer {{for the gas}} conditions in the circumstellar structures. Here we perform {{a study of the}} HI <b>decrements</b> and line profiles, from the Balmer and Paschen lines detected in the X-Shooter spectra of a homogeneous sample of 36 T Tauri stars in Lupus, the accretion and stellar properties of which were already derived in a previous work. We aim to obtain information on the gas physical conditions to derive a consistent picture of the HI emission mechanisms in pre-main sequence low-mass stars. We have empirically classified the sources based on their HI line profiles and <b>decrements.</b> We identified four Balmer <b>decrement</b> types (classified as 1, 2, 3, and 4) and three Paschen <b>decrement</b> types (A, B, and C), characterised by different shapes. We first discussed the connection between the <b>decrement</b> types and the source properties and then compared the observed <b>decrements</b> with predictions from recently published local line excitation models. One third of the objects show lines with narrow symmetric profiles, and present similar Balmer and Paschen <b>decrements</b> (straight <b>decrements,</b> types 2 and A). Lines in these sources are consistent with optically thin emission from gas with hydrogen densities of order 10 ^ 9 cm^- 3 and 5000 11 cm^- 3).

30|$|The {{logarithmic}} <b>decrement</b> of a tissue’s {{natural oscillation}} characterizes its elasticity, but more directly, {{it reflects the}} dissipation of the mechanical energy within an oscillation cycle, when tissues recover their shape after being deformed. Said another way, elasticity is the biomechanical property of a muscle that characterizes the ability to recover its initial shape after a contraction or removal of an external force of deformation. Elasticity is inversely proportional to the <b>decrement.</b> Therefore, as the <b>decrement</b> of a muscle decreases, the muscle elasticity increases. In theory, a <b>decrement</b> of 0 (zero) represents absolute elasticity. Elasticity is reported as the logarithmic <b>decrement,</b> while the inverse of elasticity is plasticity.|$|R

To investigate the confound between prolonged free inspection and repeated trials in the standard <b>decrement</b> procedure, the effects of three inspection conditions (continuous, intermittent, and immediate) on the magnitude of the overestimation Mueller-Lyer illusion have been assessed under two levels of trials (a total of two or six judgments). Significant illusion decline was found only under conditions of repeated trials, with either continuous or intermittent inspection. These findings do not support the predictions of purely structural theories (including neural adaptation and efferent readiness theories), according to which degree of <b>decrement</b> should be determined solely by viewing time. Instead, the data demonstrate that illusion <b>decrement</b> is a product of practice, providing converging evidence for the view of <b>decrement</b> as involving a cognitive 'recalibration' or learning process...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIncrement and <b>decrement</b> probe {{thresholds}} {{were measured}} during {{the presentation of}} two types of temporal masking stimuli. In Experiment 1, we measured thresholds for increment or <b>decrement</b> rectangular probes presented during the presentation of an increment or <b>decrement</b> Gaussian masking stimulus. We find that thresholds are higher when the probe and the Gaussian mask are of the same sign (e. g. both increments). However, both types of Gaussian mask raised increment and <b>decrement</b> probe thresholds above steady state conditions. In Experiment 2, we presented increment or <b>decrement</b> probes at one of eight possible phases of a 1 Hz luminance-modulated sine wave. For both increment and <b>decrement</b> probes, threshold variation with phase is non-sinusoidal in shape, but increment and <b>decrement</b> probe thresholds vary {{as a function of}} the sinusoid phase. These experiments show that increment and <b>decrement</b> thresholds vary {{as a function of the}} adaptation state of the visual system, and as a function of the direction of change in the adaptation state. Data from both experiments are discussed in terms of a recent neurophysiological model [Hood & Graham (1998). Threshold fluctuations on temporally modulated backgrounds: a possible physiological explanation based upon a recent computational model. Visual Neuroscience, 15 (5), 957 – 967]. We find that the predicted ON- and OFF-pathway responses do not correlate in a straightforward manner with the psychophysical thresholds, suggesting that detection of increment and <b>decrement</b> probes may not be performed exclusively by one pathway. Our data have implications for modeling visual performance under conditions where visual adaptation is dynamic, such as when scanning complex images or natural scenes...|$|R
