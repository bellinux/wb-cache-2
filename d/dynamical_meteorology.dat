Originally developed as a generalization of Newtonian mechanics, describing gravitationally driven motion from the simple pendulum to celestial mechanics, it also applies to such diverse areas of physics as quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, and optics – in short, to any physical system for which dissipation is negligible. <b>Dynamical</b> <b>meteorology</b> consists of the fundamental laws of physics, including Newton’s second law. For many purposes, diabatic and viscous processes can be neglected and the equations are then conservative. (For example, in idealized modeling studies, dissipation is often only present for numerical reasons and is kept as small as possible.) In such cases <b>dynamical</b> <b>meteorology</b> obeys Hamiltonian dynamics. Even when nonconservative processes are not negligible, it often turns out that separate analysis of the conservative dynamics, which fully describes the nonlinear interactions, is essential for {{an understanding of the}} complete system, and the Hamiltonian description can play a useful role in this respect.

40|$|We {{present results}} {{regarding}} the <b>dynamical</b> <b>meteorology</b> of Jupiter's White Ovals {{at different points}} in their evolution. Starting from the era with three White Ovals FA, BC, and DE (Galileo), continuing to the post-merger epoch with only one Oval BA (Cassini), and finally to Oval BA's current reddened state (New Horizons), we demonstrate that the dynamics of their flow have similarly evolved along with their appearance. The northern periphery of Oval BA increased in speed by 20 m/s from Cassini to New Horizons, ending up at a speed nearly identical to that of the northern periphery of Oval DE during Galileo. However, the peak speeds along the southern rim of the newly formed Oval BA were consistently faster than the corresponding speeds in Oval DE, and they increased still further between Cassini and New Horizons, ending up at ~ 140 to 150 m/s. The modest strengthening of the winds in Oval BA, the appearance of red aerosols, and the appearance of a turbulent, cyclonic feature to Oval BA's northwest create a strong resemblance with the Great Red Spot from both a dynamical and morphological perspective. In addition to the White Ovals, we also measure the winds within two compact cyclonic regions, one in the Galileo data set and one in the Cassini data set. In the images, these cyclonic features appear turbulent and filamentary, but our wind field reveals that the flow manifests as a coherent high-speed collar surrounding relatively quiescent interiors.

40|$|In recent years, a {{significant}} number of high-impact weather and extreme climate events have inflicted catastrophic property damage, and loss of human life, around the world, and hindered socio-economic development. Improving simulation and prediction of these events is an increasingly important requirement of public meteorological services. Based largely on an International Commission on <b>Dynamical</b> <b>Meteorology</b> (ICDM) workshop, this timely volume covers a range of important research issues related to extreme events. Dynamical linkages between these extremes and various atmospheric and ocean phenomena are examined, including Atlantic Multi-decadal, North Atlantic, and Madden–Julian Oscillations, Annular Modes, Tropical cyclones, and Asian monsoons. This book also examines the predictability of high-impact weather and extreme climate events on multiple time scales. Highlighting recent research and new advances in the field, this book enhances understanding of dynamical and physical processes associated with these events, to help Managers and policy makers make informed decisions to manage risk and prevent or mitigate disasters. It also provides guidance on future research directions for experts and young scientists. Written by leading researchers in weather and climate extremes, this comprehensive volume is ideal for professionals and policy makers working in disaster prevention and mitigation, and is a key resource for graduate students and academic researchers in atmospheric science, meteorology, climate science, and weather forecasting...|$|E

In the Galileo epoch, Oval DE had an elliptical shape with peak zonal wind speeds of ∼ 90 m s− 1 in both its northern and southern peripheries.

40|$|The {{scientific}} study {{of the dynamics of}} the atmosphere can broadly be defined as the attempt to elucidate the nature and causes of atmospheric motions through the laws of classical physics. The relevant principles are Newton’s second law of motion applied to a fluid (the atmosphere), the equation of mass continuity, the ideal gas law, and the first law of thermodynamics. These principles are developed in detail in the contribution by Murry Salby. Since the empirical discovery and mathematical statement of these laws was not completed until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, as defined above, atmospheric dynamics was nonexistent before 1875. Nonetheless, attempts at applying dynamical reasoning using principles of dynamics appeared as early as 1735, in a work discussing the cause of the trade winds. Hadley’s contribution and a complete history of theories of the atmospheric general circulation can be found in the monograph by Lorenz (1967). The recognition that the laws enumerated above were sufficient to describe and even predict atmospheric motions is generally attributed to Vilhelm Bjerknes. He noted this fact in a study (1904) detailing both the statement of the central problem of meteorology (as seen by Bjerknes), weather prediction, and the system of equations necessary and sufficient to carry out the solution of the central problem. The chapter by Eugenia Kalnay describes the progress toward the solution of the central problem made since 1904 and the current state-of-the-art methods that marry the dynamical principles spelled out by Bjerknes and the computational technology brought to applicability by John von Neumann, who recognized in weather prediction a problem ideally suited for the electronic computer.
