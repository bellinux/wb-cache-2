40|$|Purpose of this treatise- This Paper aims to {{investigate}} the Sustainability of Health <b>Facility</b> <b>Committees</b> in the Nelson Mandela Bay Health District. Design/methodology/approach – This study consists of a literature review and a pilot study. Qualitative research approach was used {{in order to obtain}} descriptive data from the targeted group. The primary sources of data collection the researcher used were from the members of the <b>committee,</b> health <b>facility</b> manager, chairperson and the health promoter who are members of the health committees. Focus group discussions with health committees were conducted to provide rich in-depth data. Literature and journal articles were also used to provide secondary data to corroborate findings. Research limitations- A major limitation to this study is that {{due to the nature of}} the nature of the research report it was not possible to assess the sustainability of health <b>Facility</b> <b>Committees</b> from other areas in the Nelson Mandela Bay Health District. Findings-The study has revealed that Community Health committees are sustained by the commitment and passion members have for the work done in the <b>facilities</b> and health <b>committees.</b> The study also revealed that social cohesion plays a major part in the sustainability of Community Health Committees (CHC). Lack of involvement by ward councilors, support from the Health Department, uncertainty of responsibilities by the health committees and limited skills were indicated as major setbacks threatening the sustainability of Community Health Committees. It can thus be concluded that these limitations must be properly addressed in order to enable and uphold the sustainability of Community Health Committees. Original/value -So far, there has been limited research which has been undertaken with regards to the subject of Sustainability of Health <b>Facility</b> <b>Committees</b> in Nelson Mandela Bay Health District. This study will aid in enabling a better understanding of what sustains Community Health Committees and the Challenges facing such communities in order to enable individuals and the parties involved to better formulate solutions to overcome these challenges in Nelson Mandela Bay...|$|R
