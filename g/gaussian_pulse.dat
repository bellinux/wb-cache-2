40|$|Optical signals {{have two}} basic {{components}} that are power and phase, {{which can be}} demonstrated in both time and frequency domains. The common diagnostics which {{are available in the}} market only measure power component in time or frequency domain. However in certain areas phase measurements are also required. The phase retrieval techniques are used to calculate phase measurements from different methods. There are a number of applications where phase measurements are required like astronomy, wavefront sensing technique (James Webb space telescope), x-ray crystallography, fiber optic telecommunications etc. Various phase retrieval algorithms have been used in retrieving phase measurements in temporal and frequency domains. Gerchberg Saxton Algorithm technique is an iterative phase retrieval technique which has been used in phase retrieval methods. This iterative process involves iterative Fourier transformation {{back and forth between the}} object and Fourier domains with applications of the measured data or known constraints in each domain. We worked on developing an iterative phase retrieval technique keeping Gerchberg Saxton Algorithm as the basis of it and were able to successfully demonstrate phase retrieval in both temporal and spectral forms for a) <b>Gaussian</b> <b>pulses</b> having a wide range of initial educated guess phase; b) Chirped <b>Gaussian</b> <b>pulses</b> having various amounts of chirp; c) Chirped Super <b>Gaussian</b> <b>pulses</b> having various amounts of chirp.

Based on Gaussian approximation for the multiple access interference, an expression of the signal-to-noise ratio is derived for the UWB system using higher order derivatives <b>Gaussian</b> <b>pulses.</b> The effect of derivative order on the UWB capacity is investigated in AWGN multiuser channel. The information theoretic capacity of the UWB system is expressed as a function of system parameters.

Investigation is carried out towards various UWB pulse candidates for Ultra-wideband Short-Range Radar Human ID System. Simulation results by Matlab for candidates of interest are given. Typical UWB pulse generator circuits are analyzed. Simulation results of 5 th derivative <b>Gaussian</b> <b>pulse</b> generator in Cadence are provided.

The design of 7 th derivative <b>Gaussian</b> <b>pulse</b> generator generates a pulse that complies with FCC mask directly without shape filtering or frequency up-converting. The pulse generated has a wide bandwidth of 4. 1 GHz to 10. 6 GHz that not only stands out in UWB pulse generation but also exceeds the least 1. 5 GHz bandwidth required for constructing and comparing the footprints in the UWB SRR Human ID System.
