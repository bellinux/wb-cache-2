I had a few songs and parts of other songs and I {{wanted to use the}} studio to finish them. I liked the way it turned out, so for this record I said I’m not going to finish anything. You can have parts of songs and sit on them for a while, but when you’re in the studio you have a finite amount of time and you have to get in and finish them. There’s an urgency and I kind of like that pressure. It forces you to make creative decisions on <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to turn out. So that’s how I went in. I love the fact that it’s a very eclectic record and that it draws from all of my influences. It takes you on a journey and that’s what records should do. I look at the record as a whole. What I feel when I hear this record is that I’m in a different place for every song. I get inside this place and then the next song comes and I’m in a different place and I really like that. It’s really interesting to go with the music and where it takes you." ...|$|E

These data were supplemented with teacher and lecturer interviews and a university staff questionnaire.

40|$|To {{maintain}} marker {{access to}} the key pipfruit export markets of Europe and the UK ENZAFRUIT New Zealand LTD has set a target of 100 percent grower adoption of the ENZA Integrated Fruit Production programme (ENZA-IFP) by the year 2001. In 1996 eighty eight growers had adopted the programme {{out of a total}} of 1650 growers nationally, hence the adoption rate required to met this target is very steep. However, little is known about New Zealand growers' attitudes towards the ENZA-IFP programme, or the factors that may influence the programme's adoption. Interviews of randomly selected IFP and non-IFP growers were held in Hawke's Bay and Nelson during August 1997. The purpose of the interviews was to determine the factors that influence the adoption of the ENZA-IFP programme, identify differences between IFP and non IFP growers, and identify themes of technology transfer methods that may encourage grower adoption of the ENZA-IFP programme. The results of the IFP and non-IFP case study research were cross compared, then compared and contrasted with the factors identified in the reviewed literature. The key reasons the IFP growers had adopted the ENZA-IFP programme were for philosophical and environmental factors. Market access was also a key motivating factor. Financial factors, perceived risk, and poor communication were the key factors hindering adoption tor the non-IFP growers. The main financial factors were loss of the USA supply programme incentive and a lack of financial incentives to adopt IFP. Perceived risk was in the form of a perceived increase in pest and disease damage and resulting financial loss. To reach ENZA's target of 100 percent grower adoption by 2001, growers need both clear guidelines on <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be met and financial incentives over the transition period to motivate adoption. IFP technologies that bring direct financial benefits to growers, have a participatory technology transfer system, have a low level of complexity and perceived risk, and fit with a growers current production system and resources are likely to be adopted more readily.

40|$|YouTube 2 ̆ 7 s {{significance}} is partly {{to do with}} its pre-history, write HENRY JENKINS and JOHN HARTLEY YouTube: home port for lip-syncers, karaoke singers, trainspotters, birdwatchers, skateboarders, hip-hoppers, small-time wrestling federations, educators, third-wave feminists, churches, proud parents, poetry slammers, gamers, human rights activists, hobbyists. It gets ten hours of new content every minute. Where did all that come from? There is much that is new about YouTube, but there is also much that is old. The emergence of ?Do-It-Yourself? cultures of all kinds {{over the past several decades}} paved the way for the early embrace, quick adoption and diverse use of new media. YouTube has gone from nowhere to cultural ubiquity in a couple of years because we already know what to do with it. Among its precursors were the zines of the political and cultural avant-garde of the 1970 s and ? 80 s, closely tied to the growth of punk rock and the emergence of Riot Grrl feminism. They were also part of a larger history of amateur publishing; the science fiction fan community can be traced back to the 1920 s. These DIY [...] or DIWO: do it with others [...] impulses spilled over from print zines to include mix tapes and home videos. Modern cyberculture can trace its roots back to the 1960 s, with ?people?s radio,? early video activism, underground newspapers and comics; all efforts to deploy low-cost media tools and practices towards alternative ends. Many early netizens explicitly embraced the value of participatory culture. These utopian pioneers would greet YouTube?s amateurs not as mindless kids but as the fulfilment of their hopes and a validation of their predictions. The digital revolution rhetoric has assumed new media displaces the old. But YouTube exemplifies a ?convergence culture,? with its complex interactions and collaborations between corporate and grassroots media. YouTube does not so much change the conditions of production as alter the contexts of circulation and reception. Amateur, activist and avant-garde works now reach a larger public. Yet, many of those earlier advocates remain sceptical that a commercial company such as YouTube can enable alternative politics. If we want to see a more democratic culture, they argue, we need anti-corporate outlets, greater diversity among participants, more debate about whose work gets seen and how it is valued. But as Geekcorps?s founder, Ethan Zuckerman, says, any medium sufficiently powerful to enable the distribution of cute cat pictures can also, under the right circumstances, be deployed to bring down a government. Right now, people are learning how to produce, upload and circulate content. What happens next is up to us all. With YouTube, there is almost infinite scope for creative content and new ideas to be produced without the need for avant-garde leadership, expert filtering or institutional control. The so-called long tail of self-made content is accessible to anyone near a computer terminal. While most people can read, very few publish in print. Hence active contribution to science, journalism and even fictional storytelling has been restricted to expert elites, while most of the general population makes do with ready-made entertainment. But the internet does not distinguish between literacy and publication. So now we are entering a new kind of digital literacy, where everyone is a publisher and whole populations have the chance to contribute as well as consume. We can use the internet for daydreaming, mischief and time-wasting, but we can also move on to other functionality levels and purposes, including science, journalism and works of the imagination. You can find all this on YouTube. If we see YouTube as operating without a history, we erase the politics behind those struggles to prepare the way, and we may end up accepting far less than what we bargained for, or what might be possible if we participate. By reclaiming what happened before, we will have a basis for judging how well YouTube is serving participatory culture and the growth of knowledge among all sections of society. We may also find openings for ?a critique, a goal, a community, and a context? of the kind that motivated earlier DIY media-makers. As they say in The Matrix: ?I don?t know the future. I didn?t come here to tell you <b>how</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to end. I came here to tell you how it?s going to begin. ? ?
