Nollywood Reinvented, in its review of the film's final installment, praised everything about the film and commented: [...] "Shirley was successful in making this movie ‘more than a conqueror’. The fascinating thing about the Adams Apples movies is {{the wide range of}} topics it touches on (if not fully addresses). Conquering love in the face of age differences... how to deal with competitive love... the ability to discern lust from love, a quest for adventure and a lean towards reality... dealing with the mistakes of the past. Above all, realizing the importance of family and trusting God to work things out". Victor Olatoye of Nollywood Critics, in his review of chapter 1 to 3 of the film, commended the character development, gave a 3.5 out of 4 stars and concluded: [...] "If you are looking for a good movie that can make you feel a little happier, smarter, sexier, funnier, more excited and yet full of wahala if that's what you want, then Adams Apples it is. <b>Go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> a pluck, sink your teeth in them, but just know there will be troubles".

Candido's {{apprentice}} George {{shows them}} various garments and fabrics, but they reject everything {{they see as}} unfit. Candido enters and patiently describes {{the quality of his}} wares. Castruccio says he would like to purchase a penny's worth of fabric. Candido protests that a penny's worth is an absurdly small amount. Castruccio feigns offense and threatens to leave. Candido agrees to give him what he wants. Castruccio insists that his bit of fabric should be cut out {{from the middle of the}} roll, rather than from the corner. Candido patiently complies with Castruccio's request. Viola grumbles about the stupidity of Candido's patience. Candido encourages the gallants to ignore his wife's complaints. Whispering, Pioratto tells Castruccio that he has lost the 100-ducat bet. Fluello marvels at Candido's amazing patience. Candido explains that it is simply prudent business practice to satisfy a customer's demands—even if it means taking a loss every once in a while. To further demonstrate his goodwill, Candido orders some wine and drinks to the gallants' health. Rather than drinking, Viola deliberately spills her wine on the floor. Candido orders George to refill her beaker. Speaking aside, Fluello tells Castruccio that he will steal an expensive wine beaker in order to annoy Candido. The gallants finish their wine and propose another toast, but Candido refuses to take a second drink. Fluello threatens to take the wine beaker with him if Candido won't drink. Unperturbed, Candido tells him to <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> the beaker. The gallants exit, amazed at Candido's patience. Viola scolds Candido for allowing the gallants to steal the expensive beaker. Candido tells his wife to calm down. He orders his apprentice to quietly fetch the constable, but warns him not to make any accusations because the [...] "gentlemen" [...] were likely only joking, and he does not want to get them in any trouble. Viola continues complaining about Candido's ridiculous patience. George re-enters with Castruccio, Fluello, and Pioratto. George tells Candido that the constable is waiting outside the door. Frightened by the constable's presence, the gallants agree to return the beaker. They are relieved that Candido does not want to press charges against them, and ask him why he wasn't angered by their prank. Candido replies that even the loss of millions would not make him angry. The gallants praise Candido's infinite patience and exit.|$|E

5000|$|Within the Civil Constitution of the Clergy {{there was}} a clause that {{required}} the Clergy {{to take an oath}} stating the individual's allegiance to France. The oath was basically an oath of fidelity and it required every single priest in France to make a public choice on whether or not they believed the nation of France had authority over all religious matters. This oath was very controversial because many Clergy believed that they could not put their loyalty towards France before their loyalty towards God. If a clergyman were to refuse to take this oath of allegiance then they were challenging the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and challenging the validity of the assembly which had established the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. On 16 January 1791 approximately 50% of the individuals required to <b>take</b> the oath <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>took</b> it <b>and</b> the other half decided to wait for Pope Pius VI to provide instruction, since he was indecisive on what the Oath signified and how the Clergy should respond to it. It {{is important to note that}} all but seven of the bishops in France decided to not <b>take</b> the oath <b>and</b> as a reprimand those governing France began to replace the individuals with those who had taken the oath. In March 1791 Pope Pius VI finally decided that the oath was against the beliefs of the Church. By deciding that it was against the beliefs two groups were formed [...] "jurors" [...] ("refractory priests") and [...] "non-jurors" [...] and that was based on whether or not they had decided to take the oath. The Pope condemned those who <b>took</b> the oath <b>and</b> went as far as saying that they were absolutely separated from the church. Additionally, the Pope expressed disapproval and chastised King Louis XVI for signing the document that required the oath to be taken. Since the Pope expressed disapproval those who did not take it stayed unwilling to <b>take</b> it <b>and</b> as a result were replaced by those who had taken it. In addition to not receiving support from approximately 50% of the Clergy the oath was also disliked by a part of France's population. The individuals in France who were opposed to it claimed that the Revolution was destroying their [...] "true" [...] faith and this was also seen in the two groups of individuals that were formed because of the oath. Those who believed that the Revolution was causing their [...] "true" [...] faith to be destroyed sided with the [...] "non-jurors" [...] and those who believed that the French government should have a say in religion sided with the [...] "jurors." ...|$|R

He {{proceeds}} to heap abuse on Candido ("the devil's dung in thy teeth"). Candido responds with characteristic calm. Fustigo kisses Viola and snatches her wedding ring. Candido remains unmoved. Fustigo demands that Candido give him some fabric for free. In an interesting metatheatrical allusion, Candido warns Fustigo that he shouldn't behave so uproariously {{in a place where}} so many people can observe his actions. George and the apprentices encourage Candido to beat Fustigo with a cudgel. Without showing the slightest hint of anger, Candido orders the apprentices to fetch the fabric Fustigo has demanded. The apprentices begrudgingly follow his orders. Candido exits to assist another customer. George and the apprentices pretend to assist Fustigo, but secretly whisper threats and insults in his ear. They scold Viola for perpetrating such a cruel trick on her husband. Viola tells Fustigo to <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> the fabrics he wants. Exasperated, George and the apprentices beat Fustigo with clubs. Viola calls for help. Candido re-enters. Badly beaten, Fustigo exposes the entire ruse and admits that he is Viola's brother. Candido warns him to use the word [...] "coz" [...] with greater care in the future and sends him to a surgeon to have his wounds treated. An officer enters and tells Candido that he is expected to appear in the senate-house (Candido is a senator). All senators are expected to wear a long robe in the senate. Candido cannot access his robe because it is locked in a closet. Viola has the key to the closet, but she keeps it from Candido in order to vex him. Rather than getting angry at his wife, Candido instructs George to cut holes in a piece of carpet so it can be worn as a poncho. As a substitute for his hat (senators are also expected to keep their heads covered), he dons a nightcap. Warning George to refrain from laughing at his ridiculous outfit until he is gone, he heads off to the senate. Viola re-enters carrying the key to the closet. George tells her that Candido has just left, dressed like a lunatic. Viola is amazed that Candido was not vexed by her trick. She instructs George to dress in Candido's robe, hat, chain of office, etc.--a [...] "joke" [...] to surprise Candido when he gets home. George worries that Candido will be angered by the [...] "joke," [...] but Viola forces him to go along with her plan.|$|E
40|$|Using {{primary data}} and a {{combination}} of qualitative and quantitative methods the study looks into ramifications of ostracism as a factor influencing people’s behavior towards the spread of HIV/AIDS, which have devastating effects on the structure and composition {{of the family in}} Botswana. The study showed that the highest proportion of respondents who would abandon an HIV positive partner (58. 4 %) occurs among young people aged 15 to 19 years; and that the propensity to abandon an HIV positive partner diminishes with advancement in age. In-depth inquiries on why HIV positive partners would be abandoned produced responses that revolved around fear of exposure, vulnerability and association with an HIV positive individual. The study showed that the highest proportion of respondents who would not reveal their HIV positive status occurs among those who have lost a relative or a friend to AIDS. Fear of being isolated, rejected, stigmatized and unwanted featured among the top reasons why respondents would not reveal their HIV positive status. Society’s reaction towards HIV positive individuals and families with HIV/AIDS patients appeared strong enough to drive individuals to hide their positive status and to <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> the risk of onward transmission of the virus...|$|E

Just when we have begun to wrap our heads around the 2004 Tsunami and the Hurricane season {{off the coast of}} Florida (see the {{previous}} issue for a write up of last years hurricane damages), we are faced once again with a major disaster in New Orleans. As a geoscientist, it reminds me that one of our important responsibilities is to help people understand the frequency and magnitude of processes at work in the natural world, and how those processes will likely impact or lives, infrastructure and environment. With this knowledge, we can begin to make more informed decisions around risk. Steve Chatwin at the BC Forest Practices Board recently reported out on landslide frequencies following logging for pre- and post-Code blocks in three watersheds in British Columbia. With a substantial volume of literature suggesting that the post logging landslide rate is increased from the natural rate, Steve tried to answer the important question, “Has the Forest Practices Code reduced the frequency of post logging landslides? ” His article is below. In addition (and ultimately related to the question of frequency) there is an article about expert judgement and probability estimation. <b>Go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> the test, it is remarkably revealing!
