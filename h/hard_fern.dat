To {{the left of the}} boreen is Wart Stone Field, so called on account of a bullaun stone that lies in the field, water from which is said to cure warts. The boreen ends at Brusher Gap, reputed to be a place where locals left food and supplies for Michael Dwyer and his followers when they went on the run after the 1798 Rebellion. The Way enters Drummin forest, a sitka spruce plantation, where it passes an Adirondack shelter, constructed by Mountain , a volunteer group dedicated to trail preservation that has upgraded various sections of the Wicklow Way over the years. The trail climbs Paddock Hill before descending into a plantation of larch trees. The forest floor here is a habitat for spurges, heath bedstraw and fly agaric toadstools. The trail crosses the Military Road, near Laragh, and then a wooden footbridge across the Glenmacnass River. A dense spread of granite boulders litters the riverbed, glacial erratics deposited by melting glaciers {{at the end of the}} last ice age. This stretch of the trail follows an old mass path through a woodland of many native Irish tree species, including oak, rowan, silver birch and willow, carpeted with a forest floor of bilberry, bluebell and <b>hard</b> <b>fern.</b> The Way continues along forest tracks over the shoulder of Brockagh Mountain. At the highest point there is a vista over the Vale of Glendalough with the two lakes nestled in the shelter of Camaderry and Derrybawn Mountains. Exiting the forest, the Way reaches the R756 road and the Glendalough visitor centre. Crossing the Glendasan River, it passes the remains of the Monastic City, founded in the 6th century by Saint Kevin.|$|E

50|$|The {{shrub layer}} is more {{prominent}} {{and has an}} increased diversity of woody trees. Common species are: Anopterus glandulosus (Tasmanian laurel), Anodopetalum biglandulosum, Acradenia frankliniae (whitey-wood or wirewood), Archeria hirtella, Archeria eriocarpa, Cenarrhenes nitida (native plum), Trochocarpa cunninghamii, Trochocarpa gunnii (sweet-scented trochocarpa), Orites diversifolia (silkwood), Prionotes cerinthoides (climbing heath), Richea pandanifolia (pandani or giant grass tree) and, at high altitudes, Richea scoparia (honey richea). The increase in understorey shrub {{is due to the}} larger number of gaps in the canopy, and the differing light requirements of competing species. Fern diversity decreases, as a result, because of the decrease in light from the understorey. Blechnum wattsii (<b>hard</b> water <b>fern)</b> is the main ground fern; it prefers damp shaded areas and forms a very dense layer in some areas but can be absent in others. Small epiphytes are widespread, these include Hymenophyllum rarum (a filmy fern) and Grammitis billardierei. Apteropteris applanata can occur in areas containing Athrotaxis. Other larger epiphytes are usually present, but they are rarely prominent. At higher altitudes, the general appearance resembles that of a callidenderous rainforest, but the floristic differences remain the same.|$|R

2500|$|The entire {{population}} of Lomatia tasmanica consists of around 300 plants in an area less than 1.2 km long in southwestern Tasmania. The climate is wet, receiving 1700 mm of rain a year, and all plants grow within 25 m of a river or creek. It mainly grows in a rainforest or mixed forest made up of trees 8–15 m high and such species as myrtle beech Lophozonia cunninghamii, celery-top pine (Phyllocladus aspleniifolius), southern sassafras (Atherosperma moschatum), leatherwood (Eucryphia lucida), satinwood (Nematolepis squamea), blue-green tea tree (Leptospermum glaucescens) and (Anodopetalum biglandulosum), and understory species such as thyme archeria ( [...] Archeria serpyllifolia), native plum (Cenarrhenes nitida), sweet-scented trochocarpa (Trochocarpa gunnii), Raukaua gunnii, white waratah (Agastachys odorata) and Prionotes cerinthoides, <b>hard</b> water <b>fern</b> (Blechnum wattsii) and brickmaker's sedge ( [...] Gahnia grandis). Scattered Smithton peppermint (Eucalyptus nitida) tower over the canopy. Profuse moss and fern growth highlights the wetness of the habitat. Lomatia tasmanica extends into neighbouring dry sclerophyll forest composed of Smithton peppermint over an understory of blue-green tea tree on more elevated areas. Finally, it grows in a dense riverbank scrubland with species such as silver banksia (Banksia marginata), mānuka (Leptospermum scoparium), prickly-leaved wattle (Acacia verticillata), swamp honey-myrtle (Melaleuca squamea), scented paperbark (M. squarrosa), Anodopetalum biglandulosum and Smithton peppermint over a dense low understory of Bauera rubioides, Gahnia grandis, Epacris aff. heteronema, scrambling coral fern (Gleichenia microphylla), Calorophus erostris, lesser wire rush (Empodisma minus) and button grass (Gymnoschoenus sphaerocephalus).|$|R
50|$|Spruce woods {{thrive in}} the highest {{locations}} from about 800 m to the tree line at around 1,000 m above sea level. These woods are also home to some deciduous trees such as rowan, silver and downy birches (Betula pendula and Betula pubescens) and willows (Salix spec.). Conditions of high humidity foster an environment rich in mosses and lichens. In spite of the near-natural habitat {{there are only a}} few, indigenous, genetically adapted (autochthone) spruce trees. Wood-reed spruce woods dominate. A well developed ground vegetation thrives on their moderately rocky and fresh, but certainly not wet, soils, characterised in appearance especially by grasses such as shaggy wood-reed (Calamagrostis villosa) and wavy hair-grass (Avenella flexuosa). The soils in the higher regions are, as in most of the Harz, comparatively poor in nutrients and bases, so that only a few herbaceous plants occur here, such as heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile). For that reason it is more the ferns, mosses, lichens and fungi that, in addition to spruce trees, characterise these woods. Boulders and stone runs occur in the areas of weather-resistant rock in the high (alti-)montane and montane zones - these are extreme habitats for vegetation. Due to the lack of soil material, only weak, straggly, very open spruce woods thrive here. They have an especially high variety of trees and allow more room of light-loving species such as silver birch, rowan, sycamore, willow and dwarf bushes such as the blueberry (Vaccinium myrtillus). Mosses and ferns are also common here. One unusual species is the Carpathian birch (Betula pubescens subsp. carpatica). Bog-spruce woods are found around the raised bogs on marshy and boggy soils. In these sorts of places spruce woods can, in exceptional cases, also form the natural woodland in lower down the mountains. These wet, moorland woods have a high proportion of peat mosses (Sphagnum spec.). The ground vegetation may also have a rich proliferation of low bushes such as cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Clumps of purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea) are also typical of this type of woodland habitat. The characteristic species of fungi in natural spruce woods are Phellinus viticola and prunes and custard (Tricholomopsis decora).Ravine (Schluchtwald), riparian (Auwald) and river source (Quellwald) woods only occur in small areas. In these places the common beech gives way to hardier deciduous species such as sycamore, large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos), Scots elm or ash. The herbaceous layer {{is similar to that of}} the better-nourished beech woods. Notable species amongst the plant communities here include the Alpine blue-sow-thistle (Cicerbita alpina), perennial honesty (Lunaria rediviva), <b>hard</b> shield <b>fern</b> (Polystichum aculeatum) and long beech fern (Phegopteris connectilis).|$|R

Kao posljedica promjene prirodnih stanišnih čimbenika javlja se propadanje i iznenadno odumiranje njezinih stabala. Zbog intenzivnog odumiranja stabala dolazi do prekida sklopa i stvaranja manjih ili većih šumskih otvora. Takve pojave izazivaju promjenu mikroklimatskih i mi­krobioloških uvjeta te {{probleme}} kod pomlađivanja. Istraživanja su provedena u Gorskom kotaru, u području bukovo-jelovih i jelovih šuma. Osnovni cilj istra­živanja bio je utvrditi promjene kemijskog i mikrobiološkog sastava tla šum­skih otvora, te prirodno pomlađivanje na njima. Obavljene su kemijske i mikrobiološke analize šumskog tla. Mikrobiološke analize tla obuhvaćale se određivanje broja bakterija i gljiva, kao i zastupljenost funkcionalnih skupina mikroorganizama. Prema kemijskim pokazateljima utvrđene su veće vrijedno­sti u kontrolnim plohama (šumska sastojina) u odnosu na velike šumske otvore. Iznimka je bio mali šumski otvor, gdje su vrijednosti kemijskih varijabli tla bile veće u otvoru nego na pripadajućoj kontrolnoj plohi. U pogledu zastupljenosti pojedinih funkcionalnih skupina mikroorganizama mali šumski otvor ima sre­dnju biogenost tla, dok veliki otvori imaju slabu biogenost tla. U velikom ot­voru u šumi bukve i jele utvrđen je manji broj aerobnih asimbiotskih fiksatora dušika i celulolitičkih gljiva u odnosu na kontrolnu plohu. Mali otvor u šumi bukve i jele imao je veću zastupljenost pojedinih funkcionalnih skupina mi­kroorganizama tla u odnosu na pripadajuću kontrolnu plohu, osim celuloliti­čkih gljiva.

Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) is {{the most}} damaged forest tree species in Republic of Croatia. As a result of changes in natural biotope fac­tors tree degradation and sudden decline is manifested. Intensive tree decline leads to canopy degradation and creating smaller or larger forest gaps. These advents cause changes in microclimatic and microbiological conditions, and regeneration problems. Researchers are carried out in Gorski kotar, in beech-fir and fir forest areal. The main aim {{of this research was}} to determine chan­ges in chemical and microbiological composition of forest gap soil, and natural regeneration within gaps. Chemical and microbiological analyses of forest soil were done. Soil microbiological analyses included determination of total fungi and bacteria count, and presence of microorganism functional groups. According to chemical parameters higher values were found in con­trol plots (canopy) than in large forest gaps. Exception was small forest gap where values of chemical variables were higher than in corresponding control plot (table 2). In large beech-fir forest gap was found smaller number of asymbiotic nitro­gen fixators and cellulose decomposition fungi than in control plot (table 3). Small forest gap in beech-fir forest had higher value of individual soil functional microorganism groups than corresponding control plot, except cel­lulose decomposition fungi. The highest soil biogenity was found in small fo­rest gap (table 4). In large fir with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> forest gap regarding control plot was found si­gnificantly smaller total fungi count and amount of cellulose decomposition fungi (table 5). Comparing gaps between themselves total fungi count in O 1 and O 2 beech-fir forest gaps was significantly higher than in O 3 fir with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> gap. Amount of asymbiotic nitrogen fixators and ammonia forming bacteria was significantly the highest in small gap O 2, then in large gap O 1 in beech-fir forest, and the lowest in O 3 fir with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> forest gap (table 6). Amount of asymbiotic nitrogen fixators, cellulose decomposition fungi and ammonia forming bacteria was significantly higher in beech-fir forest than in fir with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> forest (table 7). The highest number of seedlings was found in gap O 1, while other two gaps have had equal plant number. Regarding control plots gap O 1 had two times more plants than control. In gap O 2 was found two times lower plants number regarding control, while gap O 3 had equal plants number as control. Considering plants age in all gaps and control plots was found the highest number of biennial plants (table 8). Considering percentage of tree species younger than three years, in gaps was found the highest proportion of silver fir, then mountain maple, and the lowest common beech (table 9). Considering the number of older trees good regeneration with deciduous tree species was found within gaps namely with mountain maple and common beech (tables 10, 11 and 12). Considering amount of different functional microorganism groups small forest gap O 2 has medium, while large gaps have lower soil biogenity. Com­paring large gaps in different forest associations, large gap O 1 in beech-fir fo­rest regarding large gap O 3 in fir with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> forest has significantly higher total fungi count, amount of asymbiotic nitrogen fixatros and ammonia for­ming bacteria. In this research was found different amount of soil individual microorganism groups comparing beech-fir forest and fir with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> fo­rest. As in larger forest gaps were found certain changes in soil microbiologi­cal characteristics regarding small gap it can be concluded that large gaps represent specific microbiotops. Namely in forest gaps are found young silver fir plants, while there is lack of older ones. According to height in gaps there are no silver fir plants higher than 50 cm. As large forest gaps are enlarging and not getting smaller, also are good regenerated with common beech and mountain maple plants, were are believe that forest gaps are biotops with exc­hanging tree species. Soil chemical characteristics in small beech-fir forest gap had higher va­lues, and large gap lower values than control plots. Soil chemical characteri­stics in large fir with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> gap had smaller values than in control plots, except soil pH value. In all gaps was found significantly lower amount of cel­lulose decomposition fungi than in control canopies. In large forest gaps was found low, and in small forest gap medium soil biogenity. Microbiological characteristics of soils in beech-fir forests have higher values than in fir with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> forest gaps. Proportion of deciduous tree species (mountain maple and common beech) younger than three years was higher in large beech-fir forest gap, while in small gap was same. In large fir with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> forest gap dominate silver fir plants younger than three years. According to number of plants younger than three years in forest gaps and control plots are dominating mountain maple and common beech plants, while proportion of silver fir plants was small...|$|E
30|$|Esler ([1967]) {{regarded}} {{the effects of}} grazing in the conversion of grassland to shrubland on Kapiti Island as diverse. Grazing either accelerates or retards succession of woody species depending on certain other site factors and can also determine which species are likely to succeed. He found that small areas of grassland remained on parts of Kapiti Island where heavy grazing occurred or {{where there was no}} grazing at all. Intensive grazing of pasture on fertile soils retarded the appearance of woody species but on other sites the invasion of manuka and kanuka ceased when sheep and goats were removed due the development of a dense deep turf. In management of hill country for pasture, intensity of grazing is a major factor in succession of woody species (Levy [1970]). Sheep and cattle grazing have different effects on reversion of hill country to woody species. Intense close grazing by sheep leads to invasion of manuka, <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> and rushes whereas controlled grazing with cattle will maintain a permanent sward provided that clovers are kept growing strongly by applications of phosphate (ibid).|$|E
40|$|Dieback {{of silver}} fir in Croatia, {{especially}} in the Dinaric part, is associated with complex changeable effects of abiotic and biotic factors. In industrial forests, the volume of dieback trees or volume of trees cut down in salvage cutting is most often used for showing tree dieback intensity, {{and can be used}} as an indicator of forest stand health status (Capecki 1981). The aim of this research was to show the correlation of silver fir dieback with habitat and structural factors, calculate the intensity of dieback according to volume, and determine tree dieback dynamics and effects of habitat factors on concentration of essential mineral nutritive elements in needles and soil. The research was carried out in the mountainous part of Croatia, in beech-fir and fir forests of Gorski Kotar. The research included the forest stands of disrupted stability and structure, at the border of the natural range of sliver fir towards a warmer area and optimum area of silver fir i. e. central part of Gorski Kotar. Data for wood mass of dieback silver fir trees were collected for the selected management units at the level of all compartments and subcompartments in the management unit. The data were being collected for twelve years (1995 – 2007). In the researched area, needle sampling from tree crowns was carried out on trees with three different levels of defoliation (60 %). Dry needle mass was determined as well as concentration of K, Ca and Mg. Soil chemical analysis included soil reaction, and amount of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the soil. The average annual silver fir dieback intensity for forest stands at the border of the natural range was 18. 3 m 3 /ha or 9. 2 % of silver fir growing stock, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 6. 2 m 3 /ha or 4. 1 %. The maximum annual dieback intensity in forest stands at the border of the natural range was 113. 0 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 55. 4 m 3 /ha. For forest stands with recorded dieback, the average annual increment was 2. 7 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 3. 3 m 3 /ha. In forest stands with sliver fir dieback, dieback intensity was higher than the value of the growing stock (Table 1). Intensity of the average annual silver fir dieback at the border of the natural range was from 1. 6 to 18. 8 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar from 5. 0 to 7. 5 m 3 /ha (Fig. 1). In forest stands at the border of the natural range, the highest average annual silver fir dieback intensity was recorded in silver fir forest with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> (18. 63 m 3 /ha), and the lowest in silver fir forest with small-reed (11. 5 m 3 /ha). Dieback intensity in the central part of Gorski Kotar was lower, the highest being in silver fir forest with small-reed (14. 4 m 3 /ha), and the lowest in the Dinaric beech-fir forest (5. 8 m 3 /ha) (Fig. 2). In forest stands at the border of the natural range, the highest dieback intensity was recorded at west and southwest exposition, and the lowest at northwest and east exposition. In forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar the highest dieback intensity was at southwest, and the lowest at north exposition. In relation to altitude, the most severe dieback intensity was observed at lower, and the lowest at higher altitudes (Table 2). According to the results shown in Table 3, in forest stands at the border of the natural range, tree dieback intensity significantly and positively correlates with exposition, growing stock (0. 23 *) and number of silver fir trees (0. 12 *), and negatively with terrain slope (– 0. 15 *), altitude (– 0. 11 *), precipitation quantities in vegetation period (– 0. 11 *), soil water balance (– 0. 11 *) and increment (– 0. 16 *). In forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar silver fir dieback intensity significantly and negatively correlates with altitude (– 0. 14 *), precipitation quantities in vegetation period (– 0. 18 *) and soil water balance (– 0. 12 *). Calcium negatively correlates with vegetation air temperatures (– 0. 23 *), and positively with vegetation precipitations (0. 23 *), which is important for drought periods because 2007 was a »drought« year (Review No. 18). The correlation coefficients of Mg concentration show the same trend with air temperatures (– 0. 48 *) and precipitation quantities (0. 48 *). The correlation of Ca concentration and soil pH value is positive and amounts to 0. 34 *, while the correlation of dry needle mass and defoliation is – 0. 40 * (Table 4). The concentration of phosphorous and potassium in the soil correlates positively with vegetation air temperatures (0. 34 *, 0. 29 *), and negatively with vegetation precipitations (– 0. 34 *, – 0. 29 *) and altitudes (– 0. 52 *, – 0. 50 *) (Table 5). Dry needle mass (g), concentration of potassium, calcium and magnesium (mg/g) decrease with the increase of tree crown defoliation (Table 6). In the current year the mass of dry needles is 0. 48 g, and in the last year it was 0. 52 g. In the current year the concentration of calcium in needles is 12. 34 mg/g, and in the last year it was 17. 06 mg/g (Table 7). The data of Fužine and Rijeka Forest Office show that the percentage share of salvage cutting or dieback of silver fir amounts up to 100 % according to prescribed yield (annual allowable cut) for the area of management units Brloško, Kobiljak-Bitoraj and Jelenje Velo (border of the natural range). On the contrary, the percentage share of salvage cuttings according to prescribed yield {{in the area of the}} management units Ravna Gora and Višnjevica (central part of Gorski Kotar) amounts up to 15 %. In the area of Gorski Kotar tree dieback was recorded on all types of geological basis and forest soils, and in all silver fir forest associations. At the border of the natural range the highest dieback intensity was recorded in silver fir with <b>hard</b> <b>fern,</b> and in the central part of Gorski Kotar in silver fir with small-reed. According to our research, the highest tree dieback volumes (m 3 and m 3 /ha) occur at the lowest altitudes and on mild slopes. Tikvić et al. (2008) reported the same results. Due to higher air temperatures and lower precipitation quantities, soil evaporation is higher at lower altitudes. During drought periods at these altitudes, soil water balance is low. Thomas et al. (2002) found positive correlation between precipitation quantities and altitude and considers that this is suitable for forest tree development at higher altitudes. In forest stands at the border of the natural range, tree dieback volume (m 3 /ha) is the lowest at northeast expositions, and the highest at west exposition, followed by different variants of south expositions, and compartments of different expositions. This was expected since the south and west expositions are warmer and more exposed to unfavourable currents from west Europe. The decrease of vegetation precipitation quantities significantly increases the volume of silver fir dieback. These results correspond to the results reported by other authors (Markalas 1992, Thomas et al. 2002, Tikvić et al. 2008). Even within the silver fir areal in one country, there are significant differences in factors affecting tree dieback. This can be proved by comparing the factors that affect dieback at the border of the natural range and in the central part of Gorski Kotar. Air temperature increase and precipitation quantities decrease result in the decrease of concentration of calcium and magnesium in silver fir needles, which is significant for drought periods and air temperature increase. Dry needle mass and calcium concentration are significantly higher in the last year than in the current year needles. According to the Meteorological and Hydrological Service, the year 2007 (current year needles) was a drought year. In the forest stand at the border of the natural range where dieback was recorded, the average annual dieback intensity was six times higher than the average annual increment, while in forest stands in the central part of the area, dieback intensity was two times higher than the annual increment. Tree dieback was recorded at all expositions, terrain slopes and altitudes, as well as in all forest associations. At the border of the natural range, relief, climate and structural factors have dominant effect on tree dieback, while in the central part of Gorski Kotar climatic factors have dominant effect on tree dieback. The increase of tree crown defoliation causes the decrease of dry needle mass, as well as the concentration of K, Ca and Mg. Drought resulted in lower concentration of magnesium and calcium in silver fir needles, and lower dry needle mass...|$|E

Promjene ekoloških čimbenika utječu značajno na nadzemni i podzemni dio ekosustava. Naglašena osjetljivost jelovih i bukovo-jelovih šuma na rubu njezina areala, odumiranje stabala te propadanje čitavih sastojina pridonijeli su da istraživanja provedemo upravo u tim šumama. Cilj je ovih istraživanja definirati stanišne čimbenike koji su u vezi s odumiranjem stabla obične jele u gorskoj Hrvatskoj, te utjecaj stanišnih čimbenika na stanje hraniva u iglicama i u tlu. Prikupljeni su podaci o drvnom volumenu odumrlih stabala obične jele na razini svih odjela/odsjeka gospodarske jedinice. Iglice su uzorkovane sa stabala triju različitih stupnjeva osutosti, a uzorci tla s dubine od 30 cm. Sastojine na rubu areala obične jele u Gorskom kotaru uvelike odumiru u odnosu na sastojine u unutrašnjosti areala Gorskoga kotara. U razdoblju od 1995. do 2007. u sastojinama na rubu areala u Gorskom kotaru prosječno je godišnje odumrlo 18, 3 m 3 /ha obične jele. U istom razdoblju u sastojinama u unutrašnjosti areala Gorskoga kotara prosječno je godišnje odumrlo 6, 2 m 3 /ha. U sastojinama na rubu areala i u unutrašnjosti areala Gorskoga kotara prosječno godišnje odumiranje stabala obične jele veće je od godišnjega prirasta. Intenzitet odumiranja stabala (m 3 /ha) statistički značajno negativno i vrlo slabo korelira s vegetacijskom količinom oborine (mm) i vodnom bilancom tla (mm). U sastojinama na rubu areala i u unutrašnjisti areala Gorskoga kotara inklinacija i nadmorska visina statistički značajno i negativno utječu na intenzitet odumiranja stabala (m 3 /ha). Kalcij i magnezij negativno i statistički značajno koreliraju s vrijednostima {{temperature}} zraka, a pozitivno s količinom oborine u vegetacijskom razdoblju, što je značajno za razdoblje suše i povećanih vrijednosti temperature zraka na području istraživanja. Dieback {{of silver}} fir in Croatia, {{especially in the}} Dinaric part, is associated with complex changeable effects of abiotic and biotic factors. In industrial forests, the volume of dieback trees or volume of trees cut down in salvage cutting is most often used for showing tree dieback intensity, {{and can be used}} as an indicator of forest stand health status (Capecki 1981). The aim of this research was to show the correlation of silver fir dieback with habitat and structural factors, calculate the intensity of dieback according to volume, and determine tree dieback dynamics and effects of habitat factors on concentration of essential mineral nutritive elements in needles and soil. The research was carried out in the mountainous part of Croatia, in beech-fir and fir forests of Gorski Kotar. The research included the forest stands of disrupted stability and structure, at the border of the natural range of sliver fir towards a warmer area and optimum area of silver fir i. e. central part of Gorski Kotar. Data for wood mass of dieback silver fir trees were collected for the selected management units at the level of all compartments and subcompartments in the management unit. The data were being collected for twelve years (1995 – 2007). In the researched area, needle sampling from tree crowns was carried out on trees with three different levels of defoliation (60 %). Dry needle mass was determined as well as concentration of K, Ca and Mg. Soil chemical analysis included soil reaction, and amount of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in the soil. The average annual silver fir dieback intensity for forest stands at the border of the natural range was 18. 3 m 3 /ha or 9. 2 % of silver fir growing stock, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 6. 2 m 3 /ha or 4. 1 %. The maximum annual dieback intensity in forest stands at the border of the natural range was 113. 0 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 55. 4 m 3 /ha. For forest stands with recorded dieback, the average annual increment was 2. 7 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar it was 3. 3 m 3 /ha. In forest stands with sliver fir dieback, dieback intensity was higher than the value of the growing stock (Table 1). Intensity of the average annual silver fir dieback at the border of the natural range was from 1. 6 to 18. 8 m 3 /ha, and in forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar from 5. 0 to 7. 5 m 3 /ha (Fig. 1). In forest stands at the border of the natural range, the highest average annual silver fir dieback intensity was recorded in silver fir forest with <b>hard</b> <b>fern</b> (18. 63 m 3 /ha), and the lowest in silver fir forest with small-reed (11. 5 m 3 /ha). Dieback intensity in the central part of Gorski Kotar was lower, the highest being in silver fir forest with small-reed (14. 4 m 3 /ha), and the lowest in the Dinaric beech-fir forest (5. 8 m 3 /ha) (Fig. 2). In forest stands at the border of the natural range, the highest dieback intensity was recorded at west and southwest exposition, and the lowest at northwest and east exposition. In forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar the highest dieback intensity was at southwest, and the lowest at north exposition. In relation to altitude, the most severe dieback intensity was observed at lower, and the lowest at higher altitudes (Table 2). According to the results shown in Table 3, in forest stands at the border of the natural range, tree dieback intensity significantly and positively correlates with exposition, growing stock (0. 23 *) and number of silver fir trees (0. 12 *), and negatively with terrain slope (– 0. 15 *), altitude (– 0. 11 *), precipitation quantities in vegetation period (– 0. 11 *), soil water balance (– 0. 11 *) and increment (– 0. 16 *). In forest stands in the central part of Gorski Kotar silver fir dieback intensity significantly and negatively correlates with altitude (– 0. 14 *), precipitation quantities in vegetation period (– 0. 18 *) and soil water balance (– 0. 12 *). Calcium negatively correlates with vegetation air temperatures (– 0. 23 *), and positively with vegetation precipitations (0. 23 *), which is important for drought periods because 2007 was a »drought« year (Review No. 18). The correlation coefficients of Mg concentration show the same trend with air temperatures (– 0. 48 *) and precipitation quantities (0. 48 *). The correlation of Ca concentration and soil pH value is positive and amounts to 0. 34 *, while the correlation of dry needle mass and defoliation is – 0. 40 * (Table 4). The concentration of phosphorous and potassium in the soil correlates positively with vegetation air temperatures (0. 34 *, 0. 29 *), and negatively with vegetation precipitations (– 0. 34 *, – 0. 29 *) and altitudes (– 0. 52 *, – 0. 50 *) (Table 5). Dry needle mass (g), concentration of potassium, calcium and magnesium (mg/g) decrease with the increase of tree crown defoliation (Table 6). In the current year the mass of dry needles is 0. 48 g, and in the last year it was 0. 52 g. In the current year the concentration of calcium in needles is 12. 34 mg/g, and in the last year it was 17. 06 mg/g (Table 7).
