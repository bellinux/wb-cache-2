Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line, {{as well as}} remote desktop access software. The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition and its first wireless product. The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004. An open interface {{for the development of}} third party tools for the appliance was made available that September.|$|E

40|$|<b>Firewall</b> {{tests have}} to be {{performed}} to verify that the <b>firewall</b> works as specified. In this work, a test case generation approach is developed, which defines test cases based on the <b>firewall</b> rule sequence and uses real traffic database to prepare test packets. Test packets can be used or injected to check if the <b>firewall</b> implementation is erroneous, i. e. the rules do not correspond to the actions of the <b>firewall.</b> Although injection based <b>firewall</b> testing is accepted as an inefficient way of testing <b>firewall</b> implementations in the literature [1], there has been no alternative method developed yet. Most of the academic work focuses on testing of <b>firewall</b> rules where <b>firewall</b> implementation is assumed error-free. Even if <b>firewall</b> implementation is errorfree, a <b>firewall</b> can be hacked and programmed to behave differently from the intended security policy. In that case, real time injection based testing is one of the ways to reveal the security breach. There are three general approaches to <b>firewall</b> testing; penetration testing, testing of the <b>firewall</b> implementation, and testing of the <b>firewall</b> rules [2]. Penetration testing is performed to check the <b>firewall</b> for potential breaches of security that can be exploited. The <b>firewall</b> implementation testing approach evaluates the correspondence of <b>firewall</b> rules with respect to the actions the <b>firewall</b> performs (e. g. if a rule indicates to block a packet but the <b>firewall</b> forwards the packet, that means a <b>firewall</b> implementation error exists) [2]. Testing of the <b>firewall</b> rules verifies whether the security policy is correctly enforced by a sequence o...|$|R

5|$|A third {{building}} {{was constructed in}} 1868 {{at a cost of}} £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for Lord Dudley. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over John Nash's practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick <b>firewalls,</b> iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors. The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson, and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a Revivalist Christian group for £31,000.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} Hideki {{considers}} {{having to take}} on a second job due to his poor financial state. He is eventually able to convince his former employer Hiroyasu Ueda to hire Chi at his bakery during his anniversary sale. Chi eventually finds herself kidnapped by Yoshiyuki Kojima. Yoshiyuki initiates a program that he had created especially for Chi, which is designed to break through her <b>firewalls,</b> and when he embraces and gropes her, Freya intervenes by binding him with wires connected to Chi and releasing a powerful, concussive blast. Hideki and Shinbo find her, and Freya vanishes, causing Chi to collapse from the energy used. She recovers and briefly reunites with Hideki, before losing consciousness. Shinbo then forces Yoshiyuki to transfer his persocom Kotoko's registration to Hideki to prevent Yoshiyuki from deleting her memories, so that a record of his kidnapping exists.|$|E

5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by <b>firewalls</b> and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E

40|$|Implementation of a <b>firewall</b> {{system for}} Internet-connected {{networks}} {{is a fundamental}} part of system security. However, effective <b>firewall</b> development and maintenance are typically complex and difficult for residential administrators. The goal is to provide mechanisms to ease <b>firewall</b> implementations and maintenance while providing reasonable security, particularly for residential settings. The use of secure, remotely-capable dynamic <b>firewall</b> mechanisms and integration with other security systems, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), can provide a low-cost, maintainable, verifiable, residential <b>firewall</b> system. Such a system lowers the barrier of entry for residential <b>firewall</b> use, providing increased security to the home user(s) and the Internet as a whole. This thesis investigates {{the creation of a}} secure, client/server mechanism for dynamic <b>firewall</b> rules modifications, and the integration of external security tools for automatic <b>firewall</b> response to apparent threats. Using these methods, one can provide low-cost, manageable, and highly verifiable <b>firewall</b> systems for small Internet-connected networks...|$|R
