30|$|A {{comparison}} between various interference mitigation techniques and <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering</b> is described, {{followed by the}} related contributions within <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering,</b> and finally, {{the contributions of the}} proposed method are described in relation to the existing literature.|$|R
30|$|There {{has been}} much {{research}} on CS signals and their processing [6] with the most recent interest being in the applications to OFDM and multicarrier signals [7]. The theory of optimal periodically time-varying filtering for CS signals was proposed in [8], which would later become known as <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering</b> [2]. Frequency-domain <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering</b> was developed in [9] and the adaptation of such structures in [10, 11]. Improving the CS features of OFDM signals has been proposed in [12, 13] for network identification and cognitive radio applications. In [13, 14], the cyclostationarity of an OFDM signal is incorporated by repeating symbols in frequency and time, respectively, {{for the purpose of}} user network identification. The use of <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering</b> to exploit the spectral redundancy of CS OFDM signals is suggested in [15] but not explored any further. The use of <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering</b> to exploit the spectral redundancy in OFDM signals induced by the cyclic prefix is proposed in [16, 17].|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} spectrum sensing of cyclostationary signals for cognitive radios. It has been reported earlier using simulation results that <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering</b> a signal, prior to spectrum sensing, may result in gains of more than 5 dB over the standard energy and cyclostationary detectors. This paper develops a quasi-analytical theory of spectrum sensing based on <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering.</b> It is shown that significant performance gains are achievable in both energy detection and cyclostationarity detection via <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering</b> of the received signal prior to the detection step. The aforementioned approach may be shown {{to reduce the number}} of samples required to achieve a given detection, performance by more than 90 % in practice, thereby reducing the sensing time in a cognitive radio system. It is also shown that the <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering</b> before energy detection may reduce the effects of SNR walls caused due to noise uncertainty. The validity of all the derived observations is verified via simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|Uc,b is {{the number}} of FSs in the <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> between OFDM symbol c and OFDM symbol b. Similarly, Vc,b {{is the number}} of FSs in the <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> {{corresponding}} to the conjugate spectrally redundant symbols in OFDM symbol c and OFDM symbol b.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that <b>FRESH</b> (frequency-shift) <b>filtering</b> prior to Viterbi {{demodulation}} in GSM basestations and/or handsets can multiply {{the number of}} cochannel signals that can be separated with M antennas by (2 M- 1) /(M- 1) : suppression of 1 interferer with one antenna, 3 interferers with a diversity antenna pair, and 2 M- 1 interferers with M antennas. The network-level simulations reported in this paper clearly demonstrate that <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering</b> prior to demodulation in GSM basestations and/or handsets provides a cost-effective means of substantially improving system performance regardless of the antenna subsystem used. In all cases considered, single antenna, pair of diversity antennas, fully adaptive array of four omnidirectional antennas per 120 ° sector, and switched-beam array of four 30 ° antennas per 120 ° sector, <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering</b> substantially reduces BER and FER (thereby improving quality) and/or reduces required SNR (thereby increasing range) and/or enables reduced frequency reuse factor (thereby increasing capacity). 1...|$|R
30|$|The {{remainder}} of the paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 provides relevant background information on cyclostationary signals, <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering,</b> and simulated annealing. In Section 3, the proposed approach is described, including the signal model, improved demodulator and its optimal weights, and the optimization of the waveform design and demodulator. Section 4 presents simulation results and a complexity analysis, and Section 5 concludes the paper.|$|R
50|$|The CIRS uses a mixed mode system {{utilizing}} mostly passive natural ventilation. There are two {{mechanical air}} handling units that supply <b>fresh</b> <b>filtered</b> air: one to the large auditorium {{and the other to}} the rest of the building. In addition, there are manual operable windows that allows for airflow and temperature control. This system reduces energy consumption, connects the inhabitants with nature, and improve their health.|$|R
30|$|The Wiener filter is a {{degenerate}} {{case of the}} <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> where α= 0 and {β} = ∅, where ∅ is {{the null}} set. In this case, no spectral redundancy is exploited by the filter leading to a decrease in performance relative to the <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{frequency-shift}} (<b>FRESH)</b> <b>filter</b> is {{a structure}} which exploits the spectral correlation of cyclostationary signals for removing interference and noise from a wanted signal. As most digital communication signals are cyclostationary, FRESH filtering offers certain advantages for interference rejection in a communications receiver. This thesis explores {{the operation and}} application of FRESH filters in practical interference scenarios. The theoretical background to cyclostationarity is clarified with graphical interpretations of what cyclostationarity is, and how a <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> exploits it to remove interference. The effects of implementation in a sampled system are investigated, in filters which use baud rate related cyclostationarity, leading to efficiency improvements. The effects of varying the wanted signal pulse shape to enhance the cyclostationarity available to the <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> are also investigated. A consistent approach to {{the interpretation of the}} FRESH filter's operation is used throughout, while evaluating the performance {{in a wide range of}} realistic channel conditions. VLF radio communication is proposed as one area where interference conditions are particularly suitable for the use of FRESH filtering. In cases of severe adjacent channel interference it is found that a <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> can almost completely remove the interferer. The effects of its use with an impulse rejection technique are also investigated. Finally, blind adaptation of FRESH filters through exploitation of carrier related cyclostationarity is investigated. It is found that one existing method loses the advantage of FRESH filtering over time invariant linear filtering. An improvement is proposed to the latter which restores its performance to that of a trained <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter,</b> and also reveals that carrier related cyclostationarity can be exploited, in some cases, by a simpler method.

40|$|The use of {{frequency-shift}} (FRESH) filtering for {{the rejection}} of adjacent channel interference (ACI) in GMSK modulated VLF communications is investigated {{in the presence of}} impulsive noise. The effects of such filtering in conjunction with a simple "holepunching " technique for removing impulses from the signal are characterised. A range of scenarios based on a high poweredGMSK interferer (10 to 30 dB greater than the signal of interest (SOI)) in an adjacent channel are described. It is known that in the presence of interference and Gaussian noise a simple <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter,</b> which exploits the cyclostationarity of the interferer, is highly effective at removing the interference. We show that when non-Gaussian impulsive noise is present, the <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> is still effective against interference. However if hole-punching is used to remove the larger impulses of the noise, this adversely affects the performance of the <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter.</b> It is concluded that in high powered interference environmen [...] ...|$|E
50|$|The second {{methodology}} {{is the use}} of an anaesthetic. The preferred {{solution for}} meiobenthologists is isotonic magnesium chloride (7.5g MgCl2 · 6H2O in 100 ml of distilled water). The sample is immersed in the isotonic solution and left for a period of 15 min, after which the meiofauna are shaken free of the substrate and again filtered out through a 45 μm mesh and immediately returned to <b>fresh</b> <b>filtered</b> seawater.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fresh,</b> <b>filtered</b> air is {{typically}} supplied {{to the interior}} of a PPPS via overhead tubing. In addition to the physical barrier provided, the positive pressurization offers additional protection in the event of exposure through a defect or puncture in the suit, for if the suit’s integrity is compromised, air will be forced out instead of being sucked in. Extensive training with the PPPS is required to safely pursue research in a PPPS within a biosafety facility.|$|R
30|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} {{was used}} to characterize the extent of which diatoms were attached onto each superhydrophobic surface. Prior to imaging, each of the surfaces were immersed in <b>fresh</b> <b>filtered</b> seawater and gently perturbed to remove any free-flowing and weakly attached diatoms. Due {{to the presence of}} shearing forces at the fluid/air/surface interface that may dislodge bound diatoms during dewetting phenomena, extra care was exercised to ensure none of the surfaces were re-exposed to air until after fluorescence microscope images were taken.|$|R
30|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for enabling communication in cyclostationary interference limited environments by adaptively inserting and exploiting spectral redundancy in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. The redundancy is formed through repeating data symbols across OFDM symbols in both time and frequency. A novel frequency shift (<b>FRESH)</b> <b>filter</b> {{is applied to}} exploit the time-varying cyclostationary properties, enabling the communication while under interference.|$|E
30|$|Any <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter,</b> {{including}} the PFD, {{is able to}} exploit the cycle frequencies within the desired signal and any interference, described by (31) and (32) of (30). Each frequency bin is now the summation of multiple complex weighted bins equivalent {{to the number of}} cycle frequencies over B OFDM symbols. The redundant bins can be utilized to our advantage by avoiding duplicate work and only computing the summation of correlated bins for a set of cycle frequencies one time.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{method in}} Section 3 presents a novel <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> for exploiting spectral redundancy within CS signals and jointly optimizes the waveform and demodulator using simulated annealing. The {{model for the}} received signal is described in Section 2.1. Cyclostationary signals and their relevant properties are described in Section 2.2. The FRESH filtering structure and the derivation of its minimum mean squared error (MMSE) filter weights is given in Section 2.3, and an introduction to simulated annealing is presented in Section 2.4.|$|E
50|$|The first, and simplest, is osmotic shock, this is {{achieved}} by submerging the sample in fresh water (clearly this will only work for marine samples) for a few seconds. This will cause the organisms to release after which they can then be shaken free from the substrate and filtered out through a 45 μm mesh and immediately returned to <b>fresh</b> <b>filtered</b> seawater. Many organisms will come through this process unharmed {{as long as the}} osmotic shock does not last too long.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWidely linear (WL) filters {{have the}} {{capability}} to perform single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) of one rectilinear or quasi-rectilinear (QR) co-channel interference (CCI). The SAIC technology for QR signals is operational in GSM handsets but requires enhancements for both VAMOS standard, an evolution of GSM/EDGE standard, and FBMC-OQAM networks, which are candidate for 5 G mobile networks. In this context, we propose and analyze in this paper, for QR signals, a SAIC/MAIC enhancement based on the concept of three inputs WL <b>FRESH</b> <b>filtering,</b> exploiting almost exhaustively both the non-circularity and the cyclostationnarity of QR signals, contrary to classical approaches which only exploit very partly these propertie...|$|R

40|$|Acid {{sulphate}} soils have fertility {{problems because}} of the modification of physical, chemical and biological properties. However, the addition of organic amendments as a rehabilitation technique of acid sulphate soils allows recovery of soil properties such as aggregate formation and aeration, among others. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the effect of organic byproducts of sugarcane jaggery production process (leaf litter, bagasse and <b>fresh</b> <b>filter</b> cake) on the physical characteristics (bulk density, total porosity and dry structural stability) of an acid sulphate soil of Paipa (Boyacá) under greenhouse conditions. A trial using a completely randomized design with 9 treatments and 3 replications, corresponding to the incorporation of organic byproducts, alone and in combination, a control (without application) and agronomic treatment (lime dolomite). The soil physical parameters were evaluated at 45 (sampling 1) and 165 days (sampling 2) after amendments application. The results indicated that the application of leaf litter, bagasse and <b>fresh</b> <b>filter</b> cake in the soil, generated a favorable response in the variables: bulk density and total porosity, after 45 days; in the second sampling, the best response in these variables was achieved with 6. 2 t/ha of leaf litter. However, the structural stability of soil did not show statistically significant differences. The application of organic byproducts of sugarcane jaggery production process improves the bulk density and the total porosity of an acid sulphate soil under greenhouse conditions...|$|E
3000|$|... (f) of the PFD from (30) {{are derived}} within this section. The MMSE filter weights are optimal as they require {{knowledge}} of the desired signal, a common assumption used in the Wiener filter [3] derivation and previous MMSE <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> weight derivations [2, 28, 29]. The MMSE filter weights are derived to find an upper bound {{on the performance of}} the filtering which future work can use as a reference. LMS algorithms for FRESH filters such as [10, 11] can be incorporated to adapt the filter weights using preambles for training or blind adaptation [30], such as decision-directed training or property restoration, and whose performance can be measured against the MMSE filter weights derived here.|$|E
30|$|An {{example is}} {{provided}} {{to demonstrate the}} increase in complexity in using the PFD, or any <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter,</b> relative to the one-tap equalizer. In this example, the PMW transmits QPSK data symbols which have been repeated twice, represented by 2 cycle frequencies, and the 16 -QAM interferer of Section 3.3 uses 3 frequencies in (29); therefore, U= 5. Neither of the two signals have conjugate spectral redundancy; therefore, V= 0. When N_CP = N/ 4, then N + N_CP/N = 5 / 4. The relative increase in number of complex multiplies is therefore 5 / 45 = 6.25, representative of all FRESH filters, including the PFD. The number of complex additions is increased by 6.25 B.|$|E

In the presence of residual frequency offsets (FO), standard SAIC/MAIC receivers lose their efficiency {{and have to be}} extended using WL frequency shifted (<b>FRESH)</b> <b>filtering,</b> which has been done recently. However, in practice the observations are low-pass filtered before sampling and processing, which may degrade the performance. In this context, the purpose of the paper is twofold. The first one is to extend the previous pseudo MLSE-based WL FRESH receiver, for sources with differential FO, to observations which are low-pass filtered. The second one is to analyze, both analytically and by simulations, the impact of the low-pass filtering on the performance of the extended pseudo MLSE-based WL FRESH receive...|$|R
30|$|We {{propose to}} insert {{spectral}} redundancy into an OFDM signal through data-symbol repetition {{to form a}} paramorphic multicarrier waveform. A paramorphic FRESH demodulator is then developed to exploit the time-varying spectral redundancy designed into the signal. A signal model is created in Section 3.1 to describe {{the nature of the}} symbol repetition, and the resulting CS properties are described in Section 3.2. The novel demodulator which exploits the time-varying spectral redundancy is proposed in Section 3.4 and its MMSE filter weights are derived in Section 3.5. The theoretical SINR at the output of the novel <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> is derived in Section 3.6, and a joint optimization is proposed in Section 3.7 to select the best operating parameters of the new paramorphic waveform.|$|E
30|$|In Sections 4.2 and 4.3, five {{different}} techniques are compared {{for their ability}} to mitigate interference. The techniques are Wiener filtering, maximal ratio combining (MRC), the proposed PFD, soft decision convolutional codes, and soft decision LDPC codes. The spectral redundancy of the interferer is exploited within the PFD results, but for no other methods. The LDPC codes used are those defined in the digital video broadcasting second generation (DVB-S 2) standard [34]. The SINR and BER are computed within the same set of Monte Carlo simulations. The length of the input signal to the <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> is a minimum of 105 samples for each run of the simulation, and the simulations continue until a minimum of 1000 bit errors are observed.|$|E
30|$|FRESH {{filtering}} occupies two overlapping, but distinct fields: {{adaptive filtering}} and cyclostationary signal processing. The <b>FRESH</b> <b>filter</b> exploits the cyclostationary properties of signals and does so {{through the use}} of adaptive periodically time varying (PTV) filtering, making it well suited for interference mitigation [2]. It can be considered as supplementing existing methods, as it is a more general case of the optimal time invariant (TI) filter [2, 3]. FRESH filters, being PTV filters, outperform their TI counterparts at the cost of additional filtering complexity. As FRESH filters exploit spectral redundancies, they are broadly applicable. This includes further improving the interference mitigation properties of DSSS [4] and array processing systems [5]. A more in-depth discussion of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} FRESH filtering can be found in [6, 7].|$|E
40|$|International audienceWidely linear (WL) {{receivers}} {{are able}} to fulfill single antenna interference cancellation (SAIC) of one rectilinear (R) or quasi-rectilinear (QR) co-channel interference (CCI), a function which is operational in GSM handsets in particular.

In this context, {{the purpose of this}} paper is twofold. The first one is to show that, contrary to what is accepted as true in the literature, QR signals are less efficient than R ones for conventional WL filtering in the presence of CCI. From this result and for QR signals, the second purpose is to propose a SAIC/MAIC enhancement, based on WL frequency shifted (<b>FRESH)</b> <b>filtering,</b> making QR signals almost equivalent to R one...|$|R
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{mitigating}} a dominant alien near-end crosstalker such as HDSL, SDSL or HPNA in DMT-based ADSL and VDSL receivers. Due to the different symbol rates of crosstalker and signal of interest, linear time-invariant filtering is not appropriate. Recently, Zeng et al. presented a method to tackle this problem [4]. In this paper, we present an alternative procedure, which, unlike the solution of [4], does not require any prior knowl-edge (such as transmission and crosstalk channel, noise character-istics, etc.) other than the crosstalker symbol rate. Moreover, it is fully adaptive, integrates equalization and crosstalk cancellation and optimizes the signal-to-noise ratio for each tone separately. Both algorithms exploit spectral correlation in the received crosstalking signal, thanks to oversampling and excess bandwidth. The method present here is based on the application of so called FREquency-SHift (<b>FRESH)</b> <b>filtering.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the performance of three models of drippers using treated sewage effluent, pure and diluted, and two types of filters, screen and disc. The treated sewage effluent used in the experiment was collected from the city’s treatment plant. The experiment included 12 lateral lines with three types of emitters to apply pure (100 %) and diluted (50 %) effluent filtered by screen and disc filters. The combination of those factors set the treatments: T 1 (50 % effluent diluted in <b>fresh</b> water <b>filtered</b> by a screen filter); T 2 (50 % effluent diluted in <b>fresh</b> water <b>filtered</b> by a disc filter); T 3 (pure effluent filtered by a screen filter); T 4 (pure effluent filtered by a disc filter).
