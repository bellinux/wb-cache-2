5|$|Eusebius, Lactantius, and Constantine each {{allege that}} Galerius was the prime {{impetus for the}} {{military}} purge, and its prime beneficiary. Diocletian, for all his religious conservatism, still had tendencies towards religious tolerance. Galerius, by contrast, was a devoted and passionate pagan. According to Christian sources, he was consistently the main advocate of such persecution. He was also eager to exploit this position to his own political advantage. As the lowest-ranking emperor, Galerius was always listed last in imperial documents. Until {{the end of the}} Persian war in 299, he had not even had a major palace. Lactantius states that Galerius hungered for a higher position in the imperial hierarchy. Galerius's mother, Romula, was bitterly anti-Christian, <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been a pagan priestess in Dacia, and loathed the Christians for avoiding her festivals. Newly prestigious and influential after his victories in the Persian war, Galerius might have wished to compensate for a previous humiliation at Antioch, when Diocletian had forced him to walk {{at the front of the}} imperial caravan, rather than inside it. His resentment fed his discontent with official policies of tolerance; from 302 on, he probably urged Diocletian to enact a general law against the Christians. Since Diocletian was already surrounded by an anti-Christian clique of counsellors, these suggestions must have carried great force.|$|E

500|$|In June 2013, Witherspoon {{filed suit}} against Marketing Advantages International Inc., {{claiming}} it used her name and image extensively in jewelry advertising without her permission, both throughout the United States and internationally. In December 2015, while Witherspoon's trademark claims to her name were rejected, <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> not established secondary meaning to her full name, {{that she did not}} claim [...] "emotional distress" [...] and the [...] "photos and facts were generally known by the public and the photos were taken in public with Plaintiff's consent", the court ruled that she could proceed with her right of publicity claims against a number of defendants. Two months later, Witherspoon withdrew her lawsuit, having [...] "come to private agreements with the various defendants, including Centerbrook Sales, Fragrance Hut, Gemvara, and others".|$|E
2500|$|Elizabeth Wulf claimed mystical {{experiences}} {{while growing}} up. [...] She claimed {{that when she}} was about four, she had a vision of herself playing on the sands of the Nile river in Egypt. [...] (Her mother told her that it was a past life.) [...] She claimed that as a child she felt God's light around her naturally, and heard a sound in her inner ear like that of an ocean wave or the roar of Niagara Falls. [...] While water-skiing, she said she felt that she was suspended in a place where other spiritual beings existed, who were joyous in the light, radiating love. [...] This motivated her {{to find out more about}} who these [...] "saints robed in white" [...] (Rev. 7:9-17) were, <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> always believed in the [...] "universality of all true religion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the report}} of [...] "he thought {{her to be a}} harlot; <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> covered her face," [...] the Gemara {{questioned}} how that could be so, for the Rabbis considered covering one's face an act of modesty. Rabbi Eleazar explained that Tamar had covered her face in her father-in-law's house (and thus Judah had never seen her face and did not recognize her), for Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani said in the name of Rabbi Jonathan that every daughter-in-law who is modest in her father-in-law's house merits that kings and prophets should issue from her. In support of that proposition, the Gemara noted that kings descended from Tamar through David. And prophets descended from Tamar, as [...] says, [...] "The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz," [...] and Rabbi Levi taught that there is a tradition that Amoz was the brother of Amaziah the King of Judah, and thus a descendant of David and thus of Tamar..|$|E

2500|$|After {{setting off}} {{to wage war}} against the evils {{of the world with}} his armies, Emperor Parikshit, the {{grandson}} of Arjuna, came across a Sudra dressed as a king who was beating a cow and an ox with a club. Parikshit immediately lead his chariot over to the scene and angrily berated the sudra for abusing the sacred cow and her mate. However, this was no ordinary sudra and these were no ordinary bovine, for the sudra was Kali and the cow and ox were embodiments of the earth goddess and Dharma. The Emperor noticed the ox was standing on one of his legs because the other three had been broken by Kali. Dharma explained his four legs represented [...] "austerity, cleanliness, mercy and truthfulness", but he had only the leg of “truth” to stand on since the other three had been broken by kali over the preceding yugas. Kali was intent on breaking all the legs that supported the reign of dharma so he could effect the expansion of his own dark reign on earth. The earth goddess cried <b>for</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> once been plentiful, but when Krishna ascended to heaven, she was forsaken and all of the prosperity left from the world. She feared evil kings like Kali would continue to lay waste to the earth.|$|E
2500|$|Following the verdict, it was {{revealed}} that Bayne had been released from prison after he had served an 18-month sentence for assault and robbery in Hamilton, just seven weeks before he murdered Nelson. He had previously been imprisoned on four occasions, following convictions for drugs charges, assault and theft. D/Supt Robertson gave a statement to the media after the verdicts were delivered, saying: [...] "Zoe Nelson was a young 17-year-old girl with everything to live <b>for.</b> <b>She</b> <b>had</b> many friends and a loving family in Newmains. Robert Bayne ruthlessly took her life and tried to dispose of her body in a cold-blooded attack. This was a particularly horrific crime and now that Bayne has been convicted, Zoe's family and the local community can hopefully try and move forward knowing [...] will not be a threat for a considerable period of time. He showed no remorse for his vile actions or the effect this murder had on Zoe's close family, who remain devastated by her loss. When the verdict was raised you saw what he can do. So the streets will be a lot safer, and hopefully the Nelson family can move on knowing that he is behind bars." [...] Lady Dorrian said: [...] "This has been... a somewhat distressing case and a stressful one." [...] Nelson's uncle told reporters: [...] "It's a relief to know he's in prison but it's not justice. He should be tortured like he tortured Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother said: [...] "I am so incredibly sorry about what happened. The lives of two families have been ruined by this tragedy." ...|$|E
