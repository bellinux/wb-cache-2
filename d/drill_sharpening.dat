40|$|Não informadoThe {{effect of}} the drill {{rotation}} and geometry on the drilling process of the free machining ABNT 303 and the ABNT 316 austenitic stainless steels has been studied. Thus, once the feed force and the drill diameter are kept constant, it can be observed how the feed values vary as the drill rotation and geometry are changed in the drilling process {{with or without a}} previous hole. Also, the machinability rating variation of the 316 steel relative to the 303 steel was detected. The low efficiency of the process {{can be traced to the}} high deformation caused by the transversal cutting edge if low rotations are concerned. As the rotation was increased and/or the transversal cutting edge action was partially or completely, avoided by the <b>drill</b> <b>sharpening</b> or the previous hole execution, the feed values increased, what implies a higher process efficiency. This can be associated with lower values of the deformation degree. The 316 steel machinability rating increase associated with a higher process efficiency makes clear that the 316 steel process efficiency improvement was greater than that for the 303 stee...|$|E
5000|$|Abrasives are {{extremely}} commonplace {{and are used}} very extensively {{in a wide variety}} of industrial, domestic, and technological applications. This gives rise to a large variation in the physical and chemical composition of abrasives as well as the shape of the abrasive. Common uses for abrasives include grinding, polishing, buffing, honing, cutting, <b>drilling,</b> <b>sharpening,</b> lapping, and sanding (see abrasive machining). (For simplicity, [...] "mineral" [...] in this article will be used loosely to refer to both minerals and mineral-like substances whether man-made or not.) ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design and {{development}} of the <b>drill</b> bit <b>sharpening</b> jigs for bench grinder. The objective of this thesis is to design the drill bit sharpener jig that enhance the better outcome rather than manual sharpening operation. The thesis follows with the development of the <b>drill</b> bit <b>sharpening</b> jig that can be attached to the bench grinder. The structural three-dimensional solid modeling of <b>drill</b> bit <b>sharpening</b> jig was developed using the computer-aided drawing software which is CATIA V 5 R 21. The strategy of validation of the model design was developed. The generative part structural analysis was then performed using simulation in CATIA V 5 R 21 to detect the Von Mises distribution. The design and suitable material will be validated. The fabrication of the jig may undergoes in various machining process such as milling, turning, electrical discharge wirecut and grinding. The assembled part shall be tested on the bench grinder. Besides, several dull drill bits will be sharpen using the jig. These assessment results are significant to improve the component design at the early developing stage. Further analysis will be conducted by testing the drilling process on the workpiece. The resharpen drill bits and the new drill bits will results on the difference surface roughness. Thus, the surface roughness analysis is performed to distinguish hole surface roughness outcomes for both drill bits. The results shows the difference of surface roughness between both hole surface is small and insignificant. Thus, it means that the outcomes is relatively same. The jig can also significantly reduce the cost and time to market, and improve product reliability and customer confidence...|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the {{original}} Dremel Moto-Tool was to rotate a bit at high speed; the bit being held in a collet. Variable-speed versions may cover a range of 3,000-37,000 RPM. The Dremel concept relies on high speed as opposed to torque unlike a conventional power drill, for example. By inserting an appropriate bit (or burr) the tool can perform <b>drilling,</b> grinding, <b>sharpening,</b> cutting, cleaning, polishing, sanding, routing, carving, and engraving. Both battery-powered and corded models are available. (Early cordless models were marketed as the Dremel Freewheeler.) Dremel options include a miniature planer attachment and a saber saw attachment that lets the tool act much like a small reciprocating saw.|$|R

While at Bernard Welding Equipment Co., Arthur and Richard saw {{how difficult it was}} to <b>sharpen</b> <b>drill</b> bits. Richard brought his father, Arthur, into the business to help develop a drill sharpener. At a 1976 Cleveland regional trade show, Darex released their first drill bit sharpener, the M-1. In 1978 Darex moved to Ashland, Oregon.|$|R
50|$|Other {{examples}} of wedges {{are found in}} drill bits, which produce circular holes in solids. The two edges of a <b>drill</b> bit are <b>sharpened,</b> at opposing angles, into a point and that edge is wound around the shaft of the drill bit. When the drill bit spins on its axis of rotation, the wedges are forced into the material to be separated. The resulting cut in the material is {{in the direction of}} rotation of the drill bit while the helical shape of a bit allows the removal of the cut material.|$|R

40|$|In modern {{engineering}} {{one most}} commonly used instrument for twist drills holes remain. Twist drills are used {{more than one hundred}} years, during which time much of their manufacturing technology has not changed. With the development of machine tools with numerical control has recently been started to use a special back-grinding in the manufacture of continuous spiral drill bit as high-speed steel and carbide. Feature of these machines is that all operations are carried out for the production of drill bits in a single setup: processing, helical grooves, helical ribbons, <b>sharpening</b> <b>drills.</b> As a tool used grinding wheels, and on one mandrel that fits over the spindle of the machine can be on one axis three wheels, which allows you to combine all the operations for the production of such a tool. Shaping chip flutes of twist drills on these machines is not shaped grinding wheel, and around a flat shape. This work describes the features of forming helical groove particleboard twist drills disk tool rectilinear forms. The effect of adjusting the parameters of circles on the shape and size of the drill flute grinding wheels obtained with a rectilinear profile. A comparative analysis of the obtained helical surface with a theory - the exact surface of a standard drill. The calculations have shown that through judicious choice of settings in terms of shaping flute drill bit can be obtained by minimizing the deviation profile of the drill flute profile of the grooves is theoretically accurate standard drill. ? ?????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????. ???????? ?????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????? ?? ????? ? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ? ????????????? ????????. ???????? ????????????? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ? ???????????? - ?????? ???????????? ???????????? ??????. ?? ??????????? ???????? ????????, ??? ?? ???? ????????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ????? ??? ???????????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ????? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ?????? ?? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ???????????? ??????...|$|R
