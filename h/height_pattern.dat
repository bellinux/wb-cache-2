In part the NECC owes its existence {{to the fact that}} the ITCZ is not located at the equator, rather several degrees latitude to the north. The change in the coriolis parameter (a function of latitude) moving across the equator combined with the ITCZ being located north of the equator leads to areas of convergence and divergence in the oceanic mixed-layer. This result is obtained from Ekman theory. Using the larger Pacific basin as an example, the resulting dynamic <b>height</b> <b>pattern</b> consists of a trough at the equator, and ridge near 5° degrees north, a trough at 10°N, and finally a ridge closer to 20°N.

40|$|AbstractA popular {{methodology}} {{to filter}} seemingly chaotic atmospheric flow into an ordered set of modes of variability {{is to identify}} those <b>patterns</b> of geopotential <b>height</b> that occur often. Historically, understanding of the leading patterns or modes of variability was determined through linear statistical methods. Recently, nonlinear methods, such as kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), have been developed that allow for assessing the degree of nonlinearity inherent in the atmospheric flow. By applying KPCA, new modes of variability may be revealed, or current modes may be refined. This study will apply KPCA to filter the atmospheric flow into dominant patterns of 500 hPa Northern Hemisphere geopotential <b>height</b> <b>patterns.</b> Geopotential <b>heights</b> at 500 hPa were drawn from the monthly NCEP/NCAR reanalysis (NNRP) from 1948 - present. This research examines the sensitivity of KPCA derived geopotential <b>height</b> <b>patterns</b> drawn from different kernel functions. The research compares the KPCA results of different kernel functions through cross-validation, assessing physical depictions and the generalization of the KPCA for each kernel. Pattern similarity of the cross- validated analyses is assessed, since {{the magnitude of the}} <b>height</b> <b>patterns</b> in high-dimensional Hilbert space will be highly dependent on the selected kernel function. The optimal kernel functions are selected using cross-correlations between the cross-validated sets, providing a baseline for future variability studies...|$|R

Moreover, the characterization of these patterns and the ability to predict their behavior for other samples led us to develop the novel concept of Sequence Biometrics.

40|$|EXTRACT (SEE PDF FOR FULL ABSTRACT) : The 1988 summer drought {{over much}} of the United States is {{described}} in terms of hemispheric mid-tropospheric flow patterns, temperature and precipitation anomalies, and sea surface temperature patterns. This drought was similar to earlier Great Plains droughts, although spatially more extensive than most.

A modified barotropic model iterating from a mean summer estimate of seasonal forcing from the May mid-tropospheric <b>height</b> <b>pattern</b> was reasonably successful in forecasting the drought. Sea surface temperature indications show that cold water (La Niña) along the equator subsequent to the 1987 El Niño, while contributory, cannot be considered a principal cause of the drought, since earlier cold water episodes did not produce drought, and other drought episodes occurred in the absence of cold equatorial waters...|$|E

Chrome on quartz masks are fabricated using colloidal nanosphere lithography and subsequently used as photolithography stamps. Hexagonal pattern arrangements with different dimensions (980, 620 and 480 nm, using colloidal particles with respective diameters) have been studied. When the mask and the imaged resist layer were in intimate contact, a high fidelity pattern replica was obtained after photolithography exposure and processing. In turn, {{the presence of}} an air-gap in between has been found to affect the projected image onto the photoresist layer, strongly dependent on the mask feature size and air-gap <b>height.</b> <b>Pattern</b> replication, inversion and hybridization was achieved for 980 nm-period mask; no hybridization for the 620 nm; and only pattern replication for the 480 nm.

40|$|Alberta Clippers are extratropical {{cyclones}} {{that form}} {{in the lee of}} the Canadian Rocky Mountains and traverse through the Great Plains and Midwest regions of the United States. With the imminent threat of global climate change and its effects on regional teleconnection patterns like El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), properties of Alberta Clipper could be altered as a result of changing atmospheric circulation patterns. Since the Great Plains and Midwest regions both support {{a large portion of the}} national population and agricultural activity, the effects of global climate change on Alberta Clippers could affect these areas in a variety of ways. Despite this reasoning, relatively few studies have addressed Alberta Clippers, especially in comparison to the other North American storm tracks. In this study, the effects of global climate change on Alberta Clippers are examined by using atmospheric analogues chosen from 1950 - 2012 based on temperature and ENSO characteristics. Composite maps of regional MSLP at 12 -hr intervals, 300 mb vector wind and geopotential height at the time of cyclogenesis, and 850 mb temperature and geopotential <b>height</b> <b>patterns</b> 36 hours after Clipper formation are constructed. Difference maps of 300 mb geopotential <b>height</b> <b>patterns</b> between each of the analogues are also constructed. One-way ANOVA tests are also used to analyze Alberta Clipper latitude and longitude values at t= 0, Clipper trajectory azimuths from t= 0 to t= 60, central MSLP values for these storms twelve hours after formation, and MSLP pressure gradients at t= 24. The results from these tests indicate that, of the four analogues, the Cold and El Niño years are the most dissimilar, maintaining statistically significant differences in upper-level wind magnitude and starting longitude values. MSLP at t= 12 is lower in the Cold storms than the El Niño storms, but statistical significance between these values is not quite achieved. Furthermore, geopotential height differences and their associated rate of change with respect to map distance indicate that the 300 mb geopotential <b>height</b> <b>patterns</b> of the El Niño and Cold analogues are quite different from one another. The La Niña and Warm analogue years are different from one another with respect to latitude and longitude values of Alberta Clippers at cyclogenesis. Based on these results, the effects of temperature increase alone will not influence the properties of Alberta Clippers as much as changes in ENSO that could be caused by global climate change...|$|R

So far, from the {{similarity}} in the present <b>height</b> <b>pattern</b> and wider surface feature between the Numa IV (Genroku) terrace and the others, it has been believed that the Numa I–III terraces also emerged by the occurrence of past Genroku-type events. However, as demonstrated by Matsu’ura and Sato (1989), the coseismic vertical displacement pattern gradually fades out with time, and after the completion of one earthquake cycle, only a permanent displacement due to steady plate subduction remains (see Figures 4 and 5 in Matsu’ura and Sato (1989)). In addition, we cannot deny the possibility that the Numa I–III terraces have been formed by Holocene sea-level fluctuation (e.g., Umitsu 1991; Siddall et al. 2003), because marine terraces can be formed by small sea-level fluctuation if the steady uplift rate of land is very fast like the southern Boso peninsula (e.g., Kaizuka 1987; Hashimoto et al. 2004). Above all, without regard to the origin of marine terraces, some of them might have been removed by sea-level fluctuation. So, {{it would not be a}} reliable way to estimate the recurrence interval of the Genroku-type events from the difference in age between adjoining terraces.|$|E

There {{are two of}} them with an important recurrence period: one observed {{at the end of}} December, known as Christmas Heat Wave (CHW), and the other during the second fortnight of January, generally after the 20 th. A heat wave is defined when the minimum temperature is greater than the average of the higher minimum temperature, and when the maximum temperature is greater than the average of the lower maximum temperature. This definition is valid for the central west of Argentina and must occur at least during two days. During CHW of December 1994 maximum temperature reached 41. 9 °C on 30 th in Mendoza Aero (SAME) located at 32. 500 S 68. 47 °W; on CHW of December 2000 maximum temperature reached 40. 10 C on 25 th. On January 30 th 2003 was registered 44. 4 °C, the highest maximum temperature in SAME since records exist. The goal of this work is to analyze the prevailing meteorological conditions during the occurrence of three Extreme Maximum Temperature Episodes (EMTE) from synoptic, thermodynamic and dynamic point of view in order to establish differences and similitudes between them. Surface data were obtained from Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) Argentina and Dirección Meteorológica de Chile (DMC); the aerological data reconstructed from NOAA Air Resources Laboratory Real Time Environmental Aplications and Display System (ARL). Reanalysis from the National Center for Enviromental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR), and ETA model from Centro de Previsao e Estudos Climaticos (CPTEC) Brazil.

Height value in 330 S is almost 50 mgp less on December 2000, justifying the presence of the Norwestern Argentinian Low (NAL) and the displacement toward the south for it habitual position helping to the occurrence of Zonda wind in surface. At SAME latitude the <b>height</b> <b>pattern</b> at 600 hPa level shows a downward trough in the EMTE December 25 th 2000, zonal flow on Decembre 30 th 1994 and the presence of a height wedge with a cut off high in January 30 th 2003. The EMTE 1994 occured {{at the end of a}} long heat wave started at the beginning of December; the zonda wind was detected above 600 hPa level.

This model results from the coupling of ECBILT, a spectral T 21, 3 -level quasi-geostrophic atmospheric model, and CLIO, a sea-ice-ocean general circulation model. First, the mechanism underlying the variability of ice volume in the model was studied by performing correlation analyses between the simulated variables. In a second step, a series of additional sensitivity experiments was performed in order to illustrate the role of specific physical processes. This as allowed us to identify a feedback loop in the ice-ocean system, which proceeds as follows: an increase in At tic sea-ice volume induces {{an increase in the}} salinity there. This salinity anomaly is transported to the Greenland Sea where it promotes convective activity. This warms up the surface oceanic layer and the atmosphere in winter and induces a decrease of the ice volume, completing half a cycle.

The average ion velocity is calculated at various altitudes and times of day. The magnitude of the average field-aligned ion velocity is on the order of 10 m/s, similar to previous results at middle and low latitudes. The results obtained for the two radars are in good agreement. During daytime the direction of the average field-aligned ion velocity changes from downward to upward around 350 km, while during nighttime it is upward at all heights. The reversal height of the daytime field-aligned ion velocity depends on solar activity. It is elevated by more than 100 km during high solar flux periods compared to low solar flux periods. The Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM) reproduces the main features of the field-aligned ion velocity climatology. The simulation results suggest that the plasma pressure gradient force and gravity force play a dominant role for the daytime field-aligned ion motion. The <b>height</b> <b>pattern</b> of the field-aligned ion velocity tends to be preserved in different solar activity conditions at constant pressure surfaces, but not at constant altitudes, which explains the observed dependence on solar activity.

AFM has been extensively used to elucidate morphological changes to DNA structure, such as the formation of knots, nicks, supercoiling and bends.

The kDNA is composed of thousands of topologically interlocked DNA circles that form a giant network.

This transport results in an annual freshwater excess of 1. 4 m over the survey area which equates to roughly 14 of the annually available fresh water in the EGC. Deep water analyses show that isopycnal mixing of Eurasian Basin Deep Water and Greenland Sea Deep Water to yield Norwegian Sea Deep Water occurs within the Greenland Basin. Historical data indicate no appreciable inter-annual fluctuation in deep water properties occurs between 1958 and 1989. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E
40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [60876008]Conventional undoped {{gallium nitride}} (GaN) surface {{was treated with}} trimethylgallium (TMGa) flow for 100 s in the ambient of H- 2 and low ammonia at 500 degrees C and 500 Torr {{followed}} by thermal annealing at 1050 degrees C. On the Gallium droplets and GaN nanoislands patterned layer-structured surface, droplet homoepitaxy of thin GaN layers was realized by flowing the surface with TMGa and low ammonia at 1035 degrees C for 400 s in the ambient of H 2. By such an in situ three-step surface modification, the surface stoichiometry (Ga/N) changed from nonstoichiometry (N-rich, 0. 92) to close-to-stoichiometry (slightly Ga-rich, 1. 04) with very thin nanoislands (20 nm in diameter and I nm in <b>height)</b> <b>patterning</b> on the smooth layer-structured surface. Photoluminescence studies show significant reduction of yellow/blue emissions, which suggests improvement of surface/interface qualities of GaN films...|$|R
40|$|Disease, mortality, {{and growth}} of benthic organisms can be {{influenced}} by and determine spatial distributions. The eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, an economically and ecologically important species in Chesapeake Bay, is found in both the intertidal and subtidal in Virginia, {{but only in the}} subtidal in Maryland. I used field experiments and sampling to determine whether disease (Dermo) mortality, {{and growth of}} oysters vary among tidal heights during summer in the Maryland and Virginia regions of Chesapeake Bay. Results indicated that Dermo prevalence and mortality decreased and growth increased with decreasing durations of intertidal air-exposure. Dermo prevalence was higher in habitats with long durations of air-exposure than in subtidal habitats but progression of the disease did not differ consistently among tidal <b>heights.</b> <b>Patterns</b> in summer mortality, growth, and disease in combination with recruitment, winter mortality, and predation likely contribute to the variation in tidal distributions of oysters within Chesapeake Bay...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{different}} {{hypotheses about}} buttress function and formation mainly involve mechanical theory. Forces {{were applied to}} two trees of Sloanea spp., a tropical genus that develops typical thin buttresses, and the three-dimensional strains were measured at {{different parts of the}} trunk base. Risks of failure were greater on the buttress sides, where shear and tangential stresses are greater, not on the ridges, in spite of high longitudinal (parallel to the grain) stresses. A simple beam model, computed from the second moment of area of digitized cross sections, is consistent with longitudinal strain variations but cannot predict accurately variations with <b>height.</b> <b>Patterns</b> of longitudinal strain variation along ridges are very different in the two individuals, owing to a pronounced lateral curvature in one specimen. The constant stress hypothesis is discussed based on these results. Without chronological data during the development of the tree, it cannot be proved that buttress formation is activated by stress or strain...|$|R
