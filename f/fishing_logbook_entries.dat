40|$|Abstract Commercial <b>fishing</b> <b>logbook</b> {{data from}} the Shark Bay managed prawn fishery in Western Australia provide king prawn catch rate data densely {{informed}} and irregularly spaced in both the spatial and temporal domains. Space–time geo-statistical analysis for the {{data from the}} 2001 to 2004 fishing seasons has shown that short term catch rate prediction is possible {{with the use of the}} product-sum covari-ance model and the subsequent kriging estimation process. However the operation of closure lines within the fishery makes it difficult to capture the high catch rate be-haviour in areas as they first open to trawling. One of these regions is the Extended Nursery Area which usually opens in the first week of May. Analysis of the survey trawls from seasons 2001 to 2003 in this region in March and April shows there is a moderate positive correlation between the actual catch rate and the survey catch rate. By using the survey catch rate data as additional data in space–time geostatisti-cal estimation of the catch rates for May 2004, the space–time behaviour of the king prawn catch rate data is more successfully captured. ...|$|R

40|$|Novel data on {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} distribution of fishing effort and population abundance are presented for the market squid fishery (Loligo opalescens) in the Southern California Bight, 1992 − 2000. Fishing effort {{was measured by the}} detection of boat lights by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS). Visual confirmation of fishing vessels by nocturnal aerial surveys indicated that lights detected by satellites are reliable indicators of fishing effort. Overall, fishing activity was concentrated off the following Channel Islands: Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and Santa Catalina. Fishing activity occurred at depths of 100 m or less. Landings, effort, and squid abundance (measured as landings per unit of effort, LPUE) markedly declined during the 1997 − 98 El Niño; landings and LPUE increased afterwards. Within a fishing season, the location of fishing activity shifted from the northern shores of Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands in October, the typical starting date for squid fishing in the Bight, to the southern shores by March, the typical end of the squid season.
