40|$|Advances {{in virtual}} reality have {{generated}} substantial interest in accurately reproducing and storing spatial audio {{in the higher}} order ambisonics (HOA) representation, given its rendering flexibility. Recent standardization for HOA compression adopted a framework wherein HOA data are decomposed into principal components that are then encoded by standard audio coding, i. e., frequency domain quantization and entropy coding to exploit psychoacoustic redundancy. A noted shortcoming {{of this approach is}} the occasional mismatch in principal components across blocks, and the resulting suboptimal transitions in the data fed to the audio coder. Instead, we propose a framework where singular value decomposition (SVD) is performed after transformation to the frequency domain via the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT). This framework not only ensures smooth transition across blocks, but also enables frequency dependent SVD for better energy compaction. Moreover, we introduce a novel noise substitution technique to compensate for suppressed ambient energy in discarded higher order ambisonics channels, which significantly enhances the perceptual quality of the reconstructed <b>HOA</b> <b>signal.</b> Objective and subjective evaluation results provide evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of both higher compression gains and better perceptual quality, compared to existing methods.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the generation and perception of three-dimensional sound fields using Higher Order Ambisonics. The first part involves the design, construction and characterisation of a hemi-anechoic chamber, as well as the design, construction, calibration and characterisation of a three-dimensional sound field reproduction system. The reproduction system is capable of rendering fourth-order 3 D HOA sound scenes. Objective measurements revealed that the system achieves an almost perfect reconstruction of the ITD cues, reasonable reconstruction of the ILD cues, and inaccurate reconstruction of the monaural cues. Sound localisation testing conducted showed reasonable lateral sound localisation was not severely affected, while elevation sound localisation was poor. The second part of the investigation focuses on the perception of the sound field generated using HOA. The measured limitations of the fourth-order system motivated {{an investigation into the}} Ambisonic order required to achieve perceptually accurate sound field reconstruction. Three methods for binaurally rendering HOA signals were studied and evaluated. Of the three methods examined, the Magnitude Optimised Reconstruction technique was rated consistently better. A discrimination test showed that the sensory threshold for perceptually accurate reconstruction was order- 12 for sound sources located on the horizon and order- 14 for sound sources located across the full sphere of space. The perceptual fidelity of mixed-order <b>HOA</b> <b>signal</b> encoding (Mixed Order Ambisonics or MOA) was investigated by conducting listening tests using headphones and loudspeakers. Complex sound scenes were encoded using both full HOA and MOA up to fourth order. Results from both evaluations showed that the perceived fidelity of the sounds improved with increasing order. Also, the addition of harmonic components on top of 2 D HOA showed greater improvement in fidelity for scenes with sound sources in elevation.

40|$|In {{this work}} we explore a simple method for {{reducing}} the bit rate needed for transmitting and storing Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA). The <b>HOA</b> B-format <b>signals</b> are simply encoded using Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) {{as if they were}} individual mono signals. Wave field simulations show that by allocating more bits to the lower order signals than the higher the resulting error is very low in the sweet spot, but increases as function of distance from the center. Encoding the higher order signals with a low bit rate does not lead to a reduced audio quality. The spatial information is improved when higher-order channels are included, even if these are encoded with a low bit rate...|$|R
