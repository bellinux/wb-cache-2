40|$|The present work {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether mean field macroscopic models are suitable to describe the dynamics of real cellular detonations. This question is posed in the framework of detonations with stream-tube area divergence that is kept constant, as to generate attenuated detonations in quasi-steady state. An exponential horn geometry is used, {{in order to keep the}} source term due to <b>geometrical</b> <b>divergence</b> constant in the governing equations of mean flow, and hence permit to establish steady travelling waves with constant losses. The experiments were conducted in two mixtures 2 C$_ 2 $H$_ 2 $+ 5 O$_ 2 $+ 21 Ar, characterized by a relatively weak instability, and C$_ 3 $H$_ 8 $+ 5 O$_ 2 $, characterized by a much more unstable cellular structure. The experiments demonstrated that such quasi-steady state detonations can be realized. The experiments permitted a unique detonation speed - divergence scaling laws to be developed. Quantitative comparisons were made with steady wave predictions based on the underlying chemistry and inviscid non-steady multi-dimensional simulations...|$|E
40|$|A ray-shooting {{approach}} is presented for calculating the interior {{radar cross section}} (RCS) from a partially open cavity. In the problem considered, a dense grid of rays is launched into the cavity through the opening. The rays bounce from the cavity walls based on the laws of geometrical optics and eventually exit the cavity via the aperture. The ray-bouncing method is based on tracking {{a large number of}} rays launched into the cavity through the opening and determining the geometrical optics field associated with each ray by taking into consideration (1) the <b>geometrical</b> <b>divergence</b> factor, (2) polarization, and (3) material loading of the cavity walls. A physical optics scheme is then applied to compute the backscattered field from the exit rays. This method is so simple in concept that there is virtually no restriction on the shape or material loading of the cavity. Numerical results obtained by this method are compared with those for the modal analysis for a circular cylinder terminated by a PEC plate. RCS results for an S-bend circular cylinder generated on the Cray X-MP supercomputer show significant RCS reduction. Some of the limitations and possible extensions of this technique are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Many governments use {{standard}} engineering methods (e. g., CNOSSOS or Nord 2000) {{to model}} outdoor noise propagation from cars, trains, and trams. These methods provide efficient approximations of long-term averaged noise levels {{based on the}} <b>geometrical</b> <b>divergence,</b> atmospheric absorption, ground effect, refraction, reflection, and diffraction. However, these methods are limited to diffraction around simple, box-shaped geometries; for example, engineering methods cannot model a T-barrier. In addition, reference methods like boundary elements or finite differences are too computationally expensive for many realistic cases. Thus, a hybrid method has been developed to improve {{the accuracy of the}} engineering methods for complex geometries and surfaces. This approach interpolates a table of 2. 5 D boundary element results to estimate the influence of the complex objects. The hybrid method produces more accurate results than the standard engineering methods compared to a fast-multipole boundary element method for a small test case using a T-barrier up to almost 2 kHz. However, significant differences between the hybrid and boundary element methods remain because the boundary element method sums the pressures coherently and the hybrid method sums them incoherently like the engineering methods do for simplicity and efficiency...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of {{residual}} stress on divergence instability of a rectangular microplate subjected to a nonlinear electrostatic pressure for different geometrical properties has been presented. After deriving the governing equation and using of Step-by-Step Linearization Method (SSLM), the governing nonlinear equation has been linearized. By applying the finite difference method (FDM) to a rectangular mesh, the linearized equation has been discretized. The results show, residual stresses have considerable effects on Pull-in phenomena. Tensile residual stresses increase pull-in voltage and compressive decrease it. The effect of different <b>geometrical</b> properties on <b>divergence</b> instability has also been studied. ...|$|R
40|$|X-ray communication, {{which was}} first {{introduced}} by Keith Gendreau in 2007, is potential to compete with conventional communication methods, such as microware and laser communication, against space surroundings. Researchers have spent much time and effort on the mission making the initial idea into reality in recent years. Eventually, the X-ray communication demonstration system based on the grid-controlled X-ray source and single-photon detection technique can deliver both audio and video information in a 6 -meter vacuum tunnel, and the bit-error-rate performance of the communication system is analyzed. But {{it is difficult to}} implement applications in industries. The point is {{to find a way to}} reduce the signal <b>divergence</b> <b>geometrical</b> attenuation and increase the distance of the communication which can be regarded as an important foundation of future deep-space X-ray communication applications. Therefore, it is urgent to study the X-ray communication system. By using a nested X-ray focusing optics as transmitting and receiving antennas of the communication system, the signal gain and the distance of X-ray communication can be greatly improved. Specifically, the nested X-ray focusing optics is similar to the Wolter type I telescope, which is widely used in the field of X-ray astronomy. The difference between them is that the Wolter type I optics is originally proposed based on a paraboloid mirror and a hyperboloid mirror, but X-ray focusing optics, the simplified Wolter type I optics, provides a single reflection by a conical approximation mirror, and it is more suitable for X-ray communication. In this paper, aiming at the future demand of X-ray communication, the optimization and analysis of the nested X-ray focusing optics are carried out, and the recurrence relations between the layers of mirrors are derived. Reasonable initial structural parameters and structure of the optics are designed. In addition, the theoretical effective collection area is calculated. Feasibility of using the X-ray focusing optics as transmitting and receiving antennas is analyzed, and the theory and structural design of the X-ray focusing optical are discussed. Signal divergence of transmitting antenna, effective area of receiving antenna, the focal spot size, and the signal gain properties are preliminary studied. The results show that the signal divergence is about 3 mrad, and the transmit gain is 23 dB; the effective area of receiving antenna is 5700 mm 2 at 1. 5 keV. Moreover, the focal spot diameter and the receive gain are 4. 5 mm and 25 dB, respectively, and the total gain of this communication system can reach up to 48 dB...|$|R

40|$|The in-situ {{measurement}} of sound reflection and airborne sound insulation {{characteristics of a}} noise barrier in Europe are currently performed following the CEN/TS 1793 - 5 European standard guidelines (last revision published in 2003 [1]). After some years {{a large number of}} barriers measured, the original method has been significantly enhanced and validated in the frame of the EU funded QUIESST project, WP 3 [2]. The sound reflection measurement method has been improved using a square 9 -microphone grid not rigidly connected to the loudspeaker, an optimized alignment al gorithm of free-field and reflected impulse responses, including fractional step shifts and least squares estimation of the best relative position, and a correction for <b>geometrical</b> <b>divergence</b> and sound source directivity. Each single measure ment is then validated by means of the Reduction Factor calculation. The airborne sound insulation measurement method has not been markedly changed since 2003, because the procedure is robust and easily applicable as it is, but some problems may still be encountered when measuring highly insulating noise barriers, due to a poor signal to noise ratio of the transmitted impulse response. In those cases it is difficult to realize just after the measurement whether the obtained data are valid or not. A method, applicable on site, to overcome this problem is described here. It is based on the Signal to Noise Ratio estimation of critical parts of the acquired impulse responses and gives a strong validation criterion. </p...|$|E
40|$|Encapsulation of fans, {{engines and}} {{machinery}} {{is a standard}} noise-control treatment. The encapsulations have generally large apertures to allow for airflow cooling. They form partial enclosures with coupling between the complex interior wave field and exterior radiation in an unbounded domain. A typical encapsulation is an engine bay where geometry, position and acoustical properties of screens and absorbers are used to control the radiated noise. The mid- and high-frequency range is often of interest, i. e. ~frequencies for which the wavelength is {{on the order of}} or smaller than geometrical details. A method suitable for this kind of problem is the intensity potential appraoch. The intensity potential approach is based on the Helmholtz decomposition of the vector field of time-averaged sound intensity into its irrotational and rotational components. The local power balance in a lossless medium is expressed in terms of the irrotational component only, and results in the Poisson equation for a scalar intensity potential of this component only. It captures the power flow from sources to the surroundings by considering the part of the intensity field that is related to flow of energy. A strength of the method is that no additional assumptions have to be made apart from what is behind the local power balance; it follows directly from the Helmholtz decomposition of the active intensity. Further, it does not violate the <b>geometrical</b> <b>divergence</b> of energy in free-field as the classical equation of acoustical diffusion. It is therefore suitable for cases where a partial enclosed volume has strong coupling to an exterior unbounded domain. The physical and theoretical background of the method is presented together with evaluations by comparison to experimental data. The comparison to experimental data shows that the method is useful in practical applications. The approach provides a robust prediction tool that has its strength at high frequencies for cases with complex geometry and multiple broadband sources...|$|E
40|$|This thesis treats data {{conditioning}} of pre-stack seismic data and simultaneous AVO inversion. The demands of pre-stack reservoir characterization are increasing, and {{the prediction of}} lithology and fluid from seismic are becoming important steps in hydrocarbon prospect evaluations. Pre-stack seismic inversion gives access to elastic parameters of the sub-surface, which, with favorable formation properties, can discriminate between lithology and fluids with good fidelity. The study area is located partly in block 24 / 3, 25 / 1 and 25 / 2 in the Norwegian North Sea. Uplift to the west {{in connection with the}} opening of the Atlantic Ocean led to a significant influx of coarse clastic sediments into the North Sea Basin during the Eocene. The general pelagic shale deposition in the area was interrupted by several episodes of sub-marine fan deposition in response to relative changes in sea level and uplift of the hinterland. These sub-marine fans have a good potential for accumulation of hydrocarbons, and large gas fields such as the Frigg and Odin fields are located in the study area. The seismic inversion process is implemented by the use of a simultaneous AVO inversion algorithm. The convolution step in the algorithm assumes plane wave propagation across the boundaries of horizontally homogeneous layers and does not take into account <b>geometrical</b> <b>divergence,</b> non-elastic absorption, wavelet dispersion, residual moveout and multiple reflections. These issues are addressed in a data pre-conditioning step. It is evident that the {{data conditioning}} play a major role in estimating subsurface parameters with good confidence. The inverted data are quality tested in several different ways, both at the wells and against measured seismic, to insure high inversion confidence. Quantitative analyses are then carried out to test the ability to discriminate between oilsand and brinesand in an Eocene submarine fan. The analyses suggest that the inverted data can be employed in lithology and fluid prediction of Eocene targets in future exploration in block 24 / 4, 25 / 1 and 25 / 2. </p...|$|E
