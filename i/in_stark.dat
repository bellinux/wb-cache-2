5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although {{some in the}} audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased them. This was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the warm reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, Steve Bridges, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.|$|E

5|$|This is <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> {{contrast}} to the stance taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring. The relationship between India and the United States was one that dramatically improved during Bush's tenure.|$|E
5|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the façade is a plain base, {{contrasting}} with and stabilising the ornate arcades that rise above it. The base is penetrated by three doors, which are <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the often imposing portals of French Gothic cathedrals. The outer two are of domestic proportion and the central door is ornamented only by a central post, quatrefoil and the fine mouldings of the arch.|$|E
5|$|Between 1934 and 1963, {{the four}} wardens of Alcatraz resided here, {{including}} the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here. The signpost at the spot shows {{a photograph of a}} trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse. The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of San Francisco Bay. Today, the house is a ruin, burned down by Native Americans during the Occupation of Alcatraz on June 1, 1970.|$|E

5|$|However, the bathhouse of {{the spirits}} cannot {{be seen as a}} place free of {{ambiguity}} and darkness. Many of the employees are rude to Chihiro because she is human, and corruption is ever-present; it is a place of excess and greed, as depicted in the initial appearance of the No-Face. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constant chaotic carnival in the background.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of four hours, a series of blunders in {{planning}} and communication had caused Lee's forces to launch three failed frontal infantry assaults across hundreds of yards of open ground, unsupported by Confederate artillery, charging toward firmly entrenched Union infantry and artillery defenses. These errors provided Union forces {{with an opportunity to}} inflict heavy casualties. In the aftermath of the battle, however, the Confederate press heralded Lee as the savior of Richmond. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> contrast, McClellan was accused of being absent from the battlefield, a harsh criticism that haunted him when he ran for president in 1864.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. <b>In</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell developed through {{the building of a}} new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the incumbency of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the dirt and grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{characteristic}} traits of Kim's mature style, first seen {{in these three}} films, are gothic excess, surrealism, horror, perversions and sexuality. Although <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the realism, harmony, balance and sentimentality typical of Korean cinema of the time, Kim's films, in an eccentric and metaphorical way, deal {{with the realities of}} postwar, industrializing South Korean society and psychology. After having firmly established his auteur status with these films, Kim's unique vision began to wane in his films of the later 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures {{as part of the}} Persian army, and the fictionalized {{portrayal}} of Persian King Xerxes I has been criticized as effeminate. Critics suggested that this was meant to stand <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the sheer masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film's Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western stereotypes of Asian and African cultures.|$|E
5|$|The Empire's {{successful}} navigation {{of these}} crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil {{emerged as a}} hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as {{freedom of the press}} and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.|$|E

5|$|The Welsh {{performance}} during the 1893 Home Nations Championship was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> {{contrast to the}} previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship for the first time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the Cardiff Arms Park. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 braziers dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.|$|E
5|$|The loud goose-like honking call is a {{familiar}} sound, particularly during the breeding season; pairs often honk in unison, and often carry {{on for some time}} when perched. The male's call is higher-pitched and more rapid than that of the female. Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the call is among the loudest and furthest-carrying of all Australian bird calls, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the relatively quiet calls of the wedge-tailed eagle.|$|E
5|$|The other 10% {{of cases}} are {{primarily}} caused by primary hyperplasia, or {{an increase of}} the number of cells. Parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of all cases, occurring most frequently in individuals around 50 years of age (<b>in</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to OFC as a result of primary hyperparathyroidism) and showing no gender preference. Approximately 95% of hyperparatyhroidism caused by genetic factors is attributed to MEN type 1. This mutation also tends to affect younger individuals.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, Espanyol {{was seen}} by the vast {{majority}} of Barcelona's citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority, <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to Barça's revolutionary spirit. Also in the 1960s and 1970s, while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia's new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life, Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen, military officers, civil servants and career fascists.|$|E
5|$|Using the {{opportunity}} to rebuild their strength, the German Army in the West was able to accumulate a strength of around 500 tanks and assault guns by late September, despite prioritization of new equipment for the Eastern Front. This was <b>in</b> <b>stark</b> contrast to the estimated 100 which had been available before. German defenses along the Siegfried Line continued to strengthen, and the Wehrmacht was able to establish a defensive depth of an average of , with the strongest defenses built opposite of Patton's Third Army.|$|E
