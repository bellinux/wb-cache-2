Women accounted for 66% of graduates in natural sciences, 28% of those in engineering and 77% of those in health and welfare. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> to judge the contribution of women to research, as the data for 2013 only cover the higher education sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the wraparound register key say it improves sound, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E

25|$|The bull shark's diet {{consists}} {{mainly of}} bony fish and small sharks, including other bull sharks, {{but can also}} include turtles, birds, dolphins, terrestrial mammals, crustaceans, echinoderms, and stingrays.

One aimed across the aircraft's travel gives less risk, partially because the light enters through the side windows, and partially because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> to keep the beam aimed exactly at the cockpit area. A beam aimed straight up gives the least risk, although {{it is still possible}} for the beam to illuminate the cockpit during a banking turn.|$|E
25|$|Tigrinya has {{a fairly}} typical set of phonemes for an Ethiopian Semitic language. That is, {{there is a}} set of ejective consonants and the usual seven-vowel system. Unlike many of the modern Ethiopian Semitic languages, Tigrinya has {{preserved}} the two pharyngeal consonants. Along with , a velar or uvular ejective fricative, these phonological elements make it easy to distinguish spoken Tigrinya from closely related languages such as Amharic. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> to tell from Tigre, as this language has also maintained the pharyngeal consonants.|$|E
25|$|Zoom lenses {{typically}} have a maximum relative aperture (minimum f-number) of 2.8 to 6.3 through their range. High-end lenses {{will have a}} constant aperture, such as 2.8 or 4, {{which means that the}} relative aperture will stay the same throughout the zoom range. A more typical consumer zoom will have a variable maximum relative aperture since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> and more expensive to keep the maximum relative aperture proportional to the focal length at long focal lengths; 3.5 to 5.6 {{is an example of a}} common variable aperture range in a consumer zoom lens.|$|E

25|$|Customer horizon {{indicates}} the market orientation {{of a company}} {{in the case of}} netchains. In a chain and network environment it reflects the ability of companies to identify downstream customers and what they need. The phrase and two measurements of customer horizons, breadth and length, were introduced by Storer, Holman and Pedersen in 2010. The importance of market orientation becomes more complicated in a netchain environment, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> to identify the customers of a specific unit. Therefore, it is even more important for companies to allocate resources for this purpose in netchains.|$|E
25|$|Even {{in other}} {{countries}} that are not known for their conservatism towards female activity showed some discrimination towards their women athletes in the 2012 Olympic Games. It was discovered that the Japanese women’s soccer team and the Australian women’s basketball team flew to London in economy seats while the male squads of their countries flew in business class. For many people this symbolized that women’s participation in sports did not exactly lead to equality because {{it might be possible}} to change society (the actions), but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> to change the more static culture (people’s beliefs).|$|E
25|$|Clinical use of fMRI still {{lags behind}} {{research}} use. Patients with brain pathologies {{are more difficult}} to scan with fMRI than are young healthy volunteers, the typical research-subject population. Tumors and lesions can change the blood flow in ways not related to neural activity, masking the neural HDR. Drugs such as antihistamines and even caffeine can affect HDR. Some patients may be suffering from disorders such as compulsive lying, which makes certain studies impossible. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> for those with clinical problems to stay still for long. Using head restraints or bite bars may injure epileptics who have a seizure inside the scanner; bite bars may also discomfort those with dental prostheses.|$|E

25|$|Malayan tapirs {{have very}} poor eyesight, making them rely greatly on their {{excellent}} {{sense of smell}} and hearing to go about in their everyday lives. They have small, beady eyes with brown irises {{on either side of}} their faces. Their eyes are often covered in a blue haze, which is corneal cloudiness thought to be caused by repetitive exposure to light. Corneal cloudiness is when the cornea starts to lose its transparency. The cornea is necessary for the transmitting and focusing of outside light as it enters the eye, and cloudiness can cause vision loss. This causes the Malayan tapir to have very inadequate vision, both on land and in water, where they spend the majority of their time. Also, as these tapirs are most active at night and since they have poor eyesight, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> for them to search for food and avoid predators in the dark.|$|E

George says he'll never do [...] "that" [...] again, and when the others express skepticism, Jerry and George make a $100 bet over who can go the longest without masturbating. Kramer then joins the bet, as does Elaine. However, Elaine is persuaded to bet $150, because the men claim that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> for men not to masturbate, as {{it is part of a}} man's [...] "lifestyle".|$|E
500|$|The result marked Manchester United's first Shield {{defeat in}} 13 years, {{and was the}} ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield.

Wenger described the scoreline as [...] "unexpected" [...] and cited the first goal as crucial in the match, given the weather conditions. He was content with how his international players, {{who had been in}} the World Cup, coped with the game's physicality. Wenger believed the result gave Arsenal a psychological boost for the Champions League campaign, as the club planned to stage their home matches at Wembley Stadium. Bergkamp felt the result showed that Arsenal had what it took to retain the Premier League title: [...] "We've still got the same mentality and that will be the basis for this year's challenge.

500|$|C. porcellus is {{not found}} {{naturally}} in the wild; {{it is likely}} descended from some closely related species of cavies, such as C. aperea, C. fulgida, and C. tschudii, which are still commonly found in various regions of South America. Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century, such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae, may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild. Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche {{similar to that of}} cattle. They are social, living in the wild in small groups which consist of several females (sows), a male (boar), and the young (which in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature are called pups). They move together in groups (herds) eating grass or other vegetation, and do not store food. While they do not burrow or build nests, they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation. They [...] tend to be most active during dawn and dusk, when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>harder</b> for predators to spot them.|$|E
