500|$|Several {{songs from}} the band's third album, Vitalogy, were premiered during this tour. The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States. A few days later, the body of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain was found in his home in Seattle due to an apparent suicide, which deeply affected Vedder. At the band's April 8, 1994 concert in Fairfax, Virginia at the Patriot Center, Vedder proclaimed, [...] "I don't {{think any of us}} would be in this room tonight if it weren't for Kurt Cobain." [...] Vedder later said that [...] "the day that we found out about Kurt... I was just spinning. I was lost and didn't know if we should play, or if we should just go home, or if we should attend the services. I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> play those next two weeks and then I'd never have to play again." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{was awarded}} a {{bachelor}} of arts degree from Loyola University Chicago in 1976, and received a master of fine arts degree from the Iowa Writers' Workshop at the University of Iowa in 1978. [...] It was while attending the Workshop that Cisneros discovered how the particular social position she occupied gave her writing a unique potential. She recalls being suddenly struck by the differences {{between her and her}} classmates: [...] "It wasn't as if I didn't know who I was. I knew I was a Mexican woman. But I didn't think it {{had anything to do with}} why I felt so much imbalance in my life, whereas it had everything to do with it! My race, my gender, and my class! And it didn't make sense until that moment, sitting in that seminar. That's when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> write about something my classmates couldn't write about." [...] She cast aside her attempt to conform to American literary canons and adopted a writing style that was purposely opposite that of her classmates, realizing that instead of being something to be ashamed of, her own cultural environment was a source of inspiration. From then on, she would write of her [...] "neighbors, the people [...] saw, the poverty that the women had gone through." ...|$|E

[...] "We will suppose that you or one of your agents had sold {{a man who did}} not know what he was buying a tract of worthless land, and he demanded compensation. What would you do?" ...|$|R
60|$|Lawrence {{would say}} no more, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> descend from my high horse, and once more seek out Poirot at Leastways Cottage.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{was very}} tired, too, after the excitements of the day; so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not face it, but would pass the night upon the open hill.|$|R
6000|$|... "Honestly? Claire dear, do {{you know}} why I came on this trip? In Schoenstrom, I heard you say you were going to Seattle. That moment, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> too, and get acquainted with you, if murder would do it. But, oh, I'm clumsy." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was awake}} longest that night. My cousins slept, the sleep of faith {{on either side}} of me. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> whisper my prayers, and stopped midway because I was ashamed, and perhaps also because I had an idea one didn't square God like that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cecilia {{was very}} anxious {{to go to the}} picnic today to see an old friend of hers," [...] she answered. [...] "She was willing to come here, but you know, Grandmother, that Cecilia is always willing to do the things {{somebody}} else ought to do, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> stand on my rights as 'Miss Newbury' for once and come to the Bay Shore." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I then said, 'Well, we are {{not only}} going to demand for the {{position}} of a commissioner, {{we are going to take}} away his seat'. And <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> contest the governor's seat in the next election".|$|R
60|$|After a {{considerable}} {{pause in the}} conversation Walkirk inquired if <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> where <b>I</b> <b>would</b> go.|$|R
5000|$|... "At that point, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> use {{whatever}} resources I had {{to restore the}} plantation. It became my passion. I loved what I saw - it was different, it was unique and I became totally involved in bringing it back to life." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} June {{the weather}} became fine again. Hay harvest was to begin {{as soon as it}} settled. There were only two fields to be mown this year, to provide just enough stuff to last until the spring. As my {{vacation}} had begun <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> help, and that we three, the father, George and I, would get in the hay without hired assistance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Almost, mamselle, but not quite. It {{was this}} way: I knew if I {{permitted}} her {{to follow me}} she would finally succeed in her quest, for she and the dear children have six eyes among them, while I have but two; so I reposed within an ash-barrel until they had passed on, and then I followed them, keeping well out of their sight. In that way I managed to escape. But it proved a hard task, for my Clarette is very persistent, {{as you may have}} noticed. So <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be more safe upon the ship than upon the shore. She is not likely to seek me here, and in any event she floats better than she swims." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have written}} this letter over three times, and torn {{each of them}} up. I do so want to say all this, and it is so desperately hard to say. I am full of fears that you despise me. I {{know there is a}} sort of high colour about me. My passion for brightness. I am absurd. But inside of me is a soul, a real, living, {{breathing}} soul. Crying out to you: 'Oh, let me help! Let me help!' I will do anything, I will endure anything if only I can keep hold of the vision splendid you gave me in the cathedral. I see it now day and night, the dream of the place I can make for you--and you preaching! My fingers itch to begin. The day before yesterday I said to myself, 'I am quite unworthy, I am a worldly woman, a rich, smart, decorated woman. He will never accept me as I am.' I took off all my jewels, every one, I looked through all my clothes, and at last <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have made for me a very simple straight grey dress, just simple and straight and grey. Perhaps you will think that too is absurd of me, too self-conscious. I would not tell of it to you if I did not want you to understand how alive I am to my utter impossibilities, how resolved I am to do anything so that I may be able to serve. But never mind about silly me; {{let me tell you how}} I see the new church.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just what <b>I</b> thought. But <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> {{that first}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{listen to what}} the two men had to say. When I got closer to the pair I made another discovery.|$|R
5000|$|... "It was a {{beautiful}} day when the scales fell from my eyes and I first encountered photographic sovereignty. A beautiful day when <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> take responsibility to reinterpret images of Native peoples. My mind was ready, primed with stories of resistance and resilience, stories of survival. My views of these images are aboriginally based - an indigenous perspective - not a scientific godly order but philosophically Native." ...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to signing for Leicester, Fuchs had {{an offer}} {{to play in the}} United States, where his family live, but he turned it down for {{financial}} reasons. He said in March 2016 [...] "My intention is to play in the US. I have come Leicester for three years. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sign one last contract in Europe, when I left Schalke, then go to the US." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another house I {{travelled}} {{down into}} Dorsetshire to see. It contained, {{according to the}} advertisement, 'perhaps the most perfect specimen of Norman arch extant in Southern England.' It was to be found mentioned in Dugdale, and dated from the thirteenth century. I don't quite know what I expected. I argued to myself that {{there must have been}} ruffians of only moderate means even in those days. Here and there some robber baron who had struck a poor line of country would have had to be content with a homely little castle. A few such, hidden away in unfrequented districts, had escaped destruction. More civilised descendants had adapted them to later requirements. I had in my mind, before the train reached Dorchester, something between a miniature Tower of London and a mediaeval edition of Ann Hathaway's cottage at Stratford. I pictured dungeons and a drawbridge, perhaps a secret passage. Lamchick has a secret passage, leading from behind a sort of portrait in the dining-room {{to the back of the}} kitchen chimney. They use it for a linen closet. It seems to me a pity. Of course originally it went on farther. The vicar, who is a bit of an antiquarian, believes it comes out somewhere in the churchyard. I tell Lamchick he ought to have it opened up, but his wife doesn't want it touched. She seems to think it just right as it is. I have always had a fancy for a secret passage. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have the drawbridge repaired and made practicable. Flanked on each side with flowers in tubs, it would have been a novel and picturesque approach." ...|$|E
5000|$|Lesser {{retired in}} 1958. [...] "I {{had reached the}} age that one either {{finishes}} on top or far below. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> end on top, and I was satisfied," [...] he said.|$|E
5000|$|Describing her experience, Ramírez said, [...] "I couldn’t {{stand the}} pain anymore. If my baby {{was going to}} die, then <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have to die, too. But {{if he was going}} to grow up, I was going to see him grow up, and I was going to be with my child. I thought that God would save both our lives." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{become an}} {{architect}} because it sounded so prestigious and so easy. Especially easy. I went {{to what was}} then Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh and quickly discovered {{that if you were}} going to be an architect you at least had to learn how to draw. But I couldn't even do that. The only passing grade I got was in English, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that about the only thing I could do was to become a newspaperman." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{my years}} of {{traveling}} from my home town of Truro to Acadia University in Wolfville (1969-1974) I learned that passenger service was about to end on the DAR. My father used to travel on the DAR to Acadia 30 years earlier so I was sad to hear the news. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be the last paying passenger on the DAR. The trip was only from Truro to near Windsor. The passenger car being too old and too sooty, I traveled in the caboose and ate my breakfast with the train crew. David Lavers ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{remember}} {{going on a}} picnic to Red Water Creek and while swimming in the creek looking at the sunlight shining through the water and making it from a translucent burnt sienna to a translucent yellow ochre, and the sparkling green water plants and water weed with tiny yellow flowers. If I went back to England <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{not be able to}} see this light, this colour to inspire paintings. The landscape in England is so cultivated and there have been so many artists before me who have said all that can be said about that landscape. Whereas the Guyana landscape, the plants, have hardly been explored. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> stay.|$|R
5000|$|... "Well, {{there was}} a guy the name of Dr. John, a hoodoo guy in New Orleans. He was {{competition}} to Marie Laveau. He was like her opposite. I actually got a clipping ... about how my great-great-great-grandpa Wayne was busted with this guy for runnin' a voodoo operation in a whorehouse in 1860. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> produce the record with this as a concept." ...|$|E
5000|$|McFadden said of {{the album}} in an {{interview}} with his official website: [...] "This album is something I have wanted to do for a long time. Ireland has produced some of the greatest songs in history and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> put my own twist on a collection of my favourite ever Irish songs by returning to my heritage, and showcasing my voice at its very best." ...|$|E
5000|$|In this segment, young Afghan {{schoolchildren}} {{discuss the}} Twin Towers' collapse. Makhmalbaf has said, [...] "When {{they asked me}} to talk about 11 September, I thought the whole world had representation except for Afghanistan, so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be their representative and tell it from their point of view. I didn't want to make it too judgmental. I wanted it to be innocent, {{through the eyes of the}} children." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've been {{painting}} in the Lake District all summer, as you know," [...] answered Uncle Blair, [...] "and one day I just got homesick to see my little girl. So I sailed for Montreal without further delay. I got here at eleven last night--the station-master's son drove me down. Nice boy. The old house was in darkness and <b>I</b> thought it <b>would</b> be a shame to rouse you all out of bed after a hard day's work. So <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{spend the night in}} the orchard. It was moonlight, you know, and moonlight in an old orchard {{is one of the few}} things left over from the Golden Age." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rakoff {{said that}} his first career choice was to be an actor: he wrote, [...] "like generations of other misfits before me, be they morphological, sexual or otherwise, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> make theatre my refuge". Rakoff {{performed}} in the theatre at university and acted while working full-time in the publishing industry and later while freelancing as a writer. For instance, he performed at the first US Comedy Arts Festival in 1995 in a play written by a friend. [...] He {{has said that he}} likes acting because it involves other people, unlike writing. However, his self-assessment of his acting ability was [...] "as it turns out, I'm a deeply uncompelling camera presence".|$|R
5000|$|Ewango has recounted {{his growing}} {{interest}} in nature as follows: “Congo, my country, has the largest forest in Africa, maybe the second-largest in the world. I {{was born in a}} forest area, and when I was growing up I assisted my uncle, who was a poacher. That was good, because it grew my passion for protecting the forest and plants. When I went to university, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to do something related to plant ecology, because I felt that plants were so beautiful. When I am studying plants, I feel like I am talking with some kind of supernatural life, like I am talking with someone who does not speak.” ...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{a report}} in The Gazette in 2001, President George W. Bush decided to quit {{drinking}} after waking up with a hangover in The Broadmoor one morning in the summer of 1986. He wrote about the incident in his book A Charge to Keep. He said, [...] "This run was different. I felt worse than usual. And about halfway through, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> drink no more" [...] and never drank again.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016 Winter-Dewhirst told In Daily [...] "I {{always felt}} that in this job time is my enemy… And so <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> make some {{significant}} changes and I would start at the top, and I would create opportunities for others {{to step up and}} seize a new agenda.” He also stated that he views the department as a [...] "business", the focus of which is now [...] "delivery and implementation".|$|E
5000|$|McCullough {{decided that}} he would {{structure}} the story of Truman's biography in chronological fashion. McCullough explained his reasoning for this decision by stating: [...] "It's been very fashionable lately to begin biographies anywhere but at the beginning, heaven forbid. But I didn't want to do anything tricky or fashionable because Truman was neither of those things. Harry Truman was a 19th-century man and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> proceed as a great 19th-century biographer would, or as Dickens would." ...|$|E

60|$|Although it {{was agreed}} that I was to travel in the motley, yet, in my lately-born shame of that apparel, <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> conceal it as best might be, {{revealing}} it only should the need arise. Moreover, it was incumbent that I should afford myself more protection against the inclement January night than that of my foliated cape, my crested cap and silken hose. So, a black cloak, heavy and ample, a broad-brimmed hat, and a pair of riding boots of untanned leather were my further equipment. In the lining of one of those boots I concealed the Lord Cesare's package; his money--some twenty ducats--I carried in a belt about my waist, and his ring I set boldly on my finger.|$|R
5000|$|Mia McKenzie's {{work has}} been {{referenced}} on news sites such as Salon, HuffPost Black Voices, New Republic, and The Brown Daily Herald. [...] In her interview with Elixher, McKenzie talks about why she started Black Girl Dangerous:As Black women, we are always so cognizant of people’s perceptions of us, and always having to modify ourselves-our tones of voice, the language we use-to make other people feel less threatened by us. We are expected to accommodate anti-Black racism by not doing or saying anything that will scare white folks. In this way, we are asked to make racism easier for people. I got tired of being expected to do that. <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> that <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> instead, embrace my own dangerousness-remake it and reshape it and retell it-and {{use it as a}} tool of self-expression.|$|R
