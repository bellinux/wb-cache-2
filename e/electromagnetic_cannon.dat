50|$|Kristian Olaf Bernhard Birkeland (13 December 1867 - 15 June 1917) was a Norwegian scientist. He is {{best remembered}} as the person whose {{theories}} of atmospheric electric currents elucidated {{the nature of the}} aurora borealis. In order to fund his research on the aurorae, he invented the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>cannon</b> and the Birkeland-Eyde process of fixing nitrogen from the air. Birkeland was nominated for the Nobel Prize seven times.|$|E
50|$|Pachacamac XIII (7): The son of Pachacamac XII and {{successor}} to the Cosmic Kenpō (Uchū Kenpō) fighting style. Originally, he could use the Cosmic Kenpo move Magnet Fist (Jishakuken), but Insarn modifies him to execute the Cosmic Science Kenpō <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>Cannon</b> (Uchū Kagaku Kenpō Denjihō). After being defeated by the Gokaigers' Gokai Blast Final Wave, an enlarged Pachacamac XIII is destroyed by Qi-based images of the Geki Beasts summoned by Gokaioh. Voiced by Yasunori Masutani (Masutani Yasunori), who voiced Pachacamac XII.|$|E
50|$|The {{scale of}} Birkeland's {{research}} enterprises {{was such that}} funding became an overwhelming obstacle. Recognizing that technological invention could bring wealth, he developed an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>cannon</b> and, with some investors, formed a firearms company. The coil-gun worked, except the high muzzle velocities he predicted (600 m/s) were not produced. The most he could get from his largest machine was 100 m/s, corresponding to a disappointing projectile range of only 1 km. So he renamed the device an aerial torpedo and arranged a demonstration with the express aim of selling the company. At the demonstration, one of the coils shorted and produced a sensational inductive arc complete with noise, flame, and smoke. This was the first failure {{of any of the}} launchers that Birkeland had built. It could easily have been repaired and another demonstration organized.|$|E
50|$|In 1954, science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke {{proposed}} a lunar base of inflatable modules covered in lunar dust for insulation. A spaceship, assembled in low Earth orbit, would launch to the Moon, and astronauts {{would set up}} the igloo-like modules and an inflatable radio mast. Subsequent steps would include {{the establishment of a}} larger, permanent dome; an algae-based air purifier; a nuclear reactor for the provision of power; and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>cannons</b> to launch cargo and fuel to interplanetary vessels in space.|$|R

5000|$|On July 14, 2011, The Jerusalem Post {{reported}} that the IDF had begun developing a successor for the Merkava series of tanks. The development was started {{in part by the}} arrival of the Trophy active protection system. With the system's ability to intercept threats at a stand-off distance, there was a review of the need for vehicles like the Merkava to have thick, heavy layers of armor. The Merkava Tank Planning Directorate set up a team to study principles for a future tank and present ideas for an armored fighting vehicle to provide mobile firepower on a future battlefield. The team reviewed basic design principles including lessening its weight, armor thickness compared to an APS to intercept anti-tank threats, reducing the crew size, and the type of main gun. Horsepower capabilities and heavy and light track systems compared to a wheeled chassis were also considered. With future battlefield condition developments affecting design features, the vehicle may not be considered a [...] "tank" [...] in the traditional sense. By July 2012, details began to emerge of considerations for developing technologies for the new design. One possibility is the replacement of the traditional main gun with a laser <b>cannon</b> or an <b>electromagnetic</b> pulse <b>cannon.</b> Other improvements could include a hybrid-electric engine and a reduced crew of two. The goals of the new tank are to make it faster, better protected, more interoperable and lethal than the current Merkava.|$|R
40|$|The Thomson ring {{experiment}} is revisited {{with the aim}} of obtaining higher and higher jump heights. A new way to determine the inductance of the ring and the phase lag between the primary magnetic flux and the current in the ring is introduced. New more effective configurations are presented, up to that of true <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>cannon</b> that fires aluminium disks with great violence. As an interesting by-product, regular geometric patterns of the iron filings used to visualize the structure of the very high magnetic fields inside the coil of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>cannon</b> are revealed, indicating the emergence a self-organization phenomenon typical of dissipative systems...|$|E
