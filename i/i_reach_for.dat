He was also given an Honorary Fellowship at his Cambridge College, Fitzwilliam College. He {{has worked as}} curator on several exhibitions, {{including}} an exhibit in 2003 on Elizabeth I, following which he had lunch with her namesake, Elizabeth II. [...] Several years later he told a reporter that the monarch {{had no interest in}} her predecessors, other than those who followed her great grandfather. [...] "I don't think she's at all comfortable with anybody – I would hesitate to use the word intellectual – but it's useful. [...] I think she's got elements a bit like Goebbels in her attitude to culture – you remember: 'every time I hear the word culture <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> my revolver.' [...] I think the queen reaches for her mask." [...] His remarks were criticised by Penny Junor, a royal biographer, and Robert Lacey, a royal historian.|$|E
2500|$|Misha Black, {{one of the}} Festival architects, {{said that}} the Festival created a wide {{audience}} for architectural modernism {{but that it was}} common currency among professional architects that the design of the Festival was not innovative. [...] The design writer Reyner Banham has questioned the originality and the Englishness of the Festival Style and indeed the extent of its influence. [...] Young architects in 1951 are said to have despised the Festival of Britain for its architecture. [...] "It was equated with the ‘Contemporary Style’, and an editorial on New Brutalism in Architectural Design in 1955 carried the epigraph, ‘When I hear the word “Contemporary” <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> my revolver.’" ...|$|E

2500|$|Prescott {{explained}} Swope's {{methods in}} a 1997 interview: [...] "What Martin did ... was tape {{something that was}} going on live, manipulate it, and send it back in (via the soundboard) as a sort of new instrument. You couldn't predict exactly how it would sound, and that got to be the really fun thing I think we all liked. We wanted to play this hammer-down drony noise stuff, but we also wanted another sound in there." [...] Swope's tapework ranged from subtle and nearly subaural (such as the quiet shifting feedback sounds in Conley's [...] "That's When <b>I</b> <b>Reach</b> <b>For</b> My Revolver"), to prominent and even jarring (such as the high-pitched two-note squeal in Miller's [...] "Red"). Journalist Michael Azerrad later wrote: [...] "A lot of people never knew about Swope's contribution and were mystified by how the musicians onstage could wring such amazing phantom sounds from their instruments." [...] Though his contribution is widely considered an integral part of Burma's sound, Swope very rarely appeared onstage, only occasionally appearing to play second guitar during encores.|$|E
2500|$|According to Martin Gardner, the [...] "other" [...] {{worlds of}} MWI have two {{different}} interpretations: real or unreal; {{he claims that}} Stephen Hawking and Steven Weinberg both favour the unreal interpretation. Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured {{by the majority of}} physicists, whereas the [...] "realist" [...] view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and Bryce DeWitt. Hawking has said that [...] "according to Feynman's idea", all the other histories are as [...] "equally real" [...] as our own, and Martin Gardner reports Hawking saying that MWI is [...] "trivially true". In a 1983 interview, Hawking also said he regarded the MWI as [...] "self-evidently correct" [...] but was dismissive towards questions about the interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying, [...] "When I hear of Schrödinger's cat, <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> my gun." [...] In the same interview, he also said, [...] "But, look: All that one does, really, is to calculate conditional probabilities—in other words, the probability of A happening, given B. I think that that's all the many worlds interpretation is. Some people overlay it with a lot of mysticism about the wave function splitting into different parts. But all that you're calculating is conditional probabilities." [...] Elsewhere Hawking contrasted his attitude towards the [...] "reality" [...] of physical theories with that of his colleague Roger Penrose, saying, [...] "He's a Platonist and I'm a positivist. He's worried that Schrödinger's cat is in a quantum state, where it is half alive and half dead. He feels that can't correspond to reality. But that doesn't bother me. I don't demand that a theory correspond to reality because I don't know what it is. Reality is not a quality you can test with litmus paper. All I'm concerned with is that the theory should predict the results of measurements. Quantum theory does this very successfully." [...] For his own part, Penrose agrees with Hawking that QM applied to the universe implies MW, although he considers the current lack of a successful theory of quantum gravity negates the claimed universality of conventional QM.|$|E

I cannot hope to equal the speed of the train, but I can reduce the difference of our speed to the minimum, and, hence, reduce the shock of impact, when I leap on board. In the fleeting instant of darkness I do not see the iron hand-rail of the last platform; nor is there time for me to locate it. <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>for</b> where I think it ought to be, and at the same instant my feet leave the ground. It is all in the toss. The next moment I may be rolling in the gravel with broken ribs, or arms, or head.
