As a result, he had insufficient resources to plant crops, he could not buy fertilizer and treatment for the crops he did plant, {{and he ended up}} losing his farm. Mr. Brown applied for a farm loan. After not hearing back, he followed up and was told his loan was being processed. After not hearing more, he followed up and was told that there was no record of his application. He reapplied, but did not receive the loan until planting season was over. Additionally, his loan was [...] "supervised", so he had to get a signature by a USDA official to take money out. It was routine for the USDA to make this a provision for black farmers, but not for white farmers. Mr. Hall lost his crops and was eligible for disaster relief payments. Every single application in his county for relief was approved by the committee except his. Mr. Beverly applied for a loan to build a <b>farrowing</b> <b>house</b> for his swine. He was told that his loan was approved, and he bought livestock in anticipation. Later, he was told the loan was denied, making his investment in livestock useless.

50|$|A two-day tornado {{outbreak}} {{took place}} in late March 2005. The outbreak began on the 21st, producing 15 weak (F0 to F1) tornadoes across Oklahoma, Texas, and Kansas. The tornado activity {{on the following day}} was more significant. The Storm Prediction Center's (SPC) Day 1 Outlook at 8 am EST, Tuesday morning, March 22 showed a slight risk for severe weather across much of the Southeast U.S. A moderate risk covered northern Mississippi, most of Alabama, and southwest Georgia. The atmosphere was very favorable for tornadic supercells. The warm front was north of Tallahassee in southern Georgia. The center of low pressure was back in eastern Oklahoma with a trailing cold front extending down through Louisiana into the Gulf of Mexico. A high-end F2 passed southeast of Pansey, Alabama, destroying two homes and three barns. Numerous trees and power lines were downed, and several mobile homes were damaged as well. Four people near Pansey were injured and transported to a hospital. Another F2 tornado touched down in Seminole County, Georgia northwest of Donalsonville and moved northeast, destroying seven mobile homes and damaging 17 others. Many trees and power lines were downed, and a woman was killed when the tornado demolished her mobile home. The Donalsonville tornado continued into Miller County, Georgia, where it reached F3 intensity before dissipating near Colquitt. The tornado damaged nearly 100 homes and destroyed 25 others along its path, and downed numerous trees and power lines. The tornado also destroyed several storage buildings, a welding shop, a <b>farrowing</b> <b>house,</b> and an implement shed. Several irrigation pivots were damaged or destroyed as well. Aside from the fatality, the Donalsonville/Colquitt tornado injured 18 people, two critically. Later that evening, an F2 tornado struck the town of Screven, Georgia, where 56 homes, 12 businesses, 2 public buildings, and a church were damaged or destroyed. Despite the severity of the damage, no serious injuries or fatalities occurred in Screven. Two weak tornadoes (rated F1 and F0) also struck the Memphis suburb of Olive Branch, Mississippi, resulting in moderate damage and one injury. Overall, the outbreak resulted in 26 tornadoes and one fatality.|$|E
40|$|A 100 -sow farrow-to-feeder {{farm with}} an outdoor {{gestation}} lot had a 4 -year history of ring-like skin lesions in lactating sows. On average, 90 % of sows in each 5 -week batch developed lesions {{within a week}} of entering the <b>farrowing</b> <b>house.</b> Lesions beginning as 2 - to 3 -cm circles of dark, crusty skin coalesced into larger areas on the back, sides, and ventral abdomen.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} the influence of housing systems on stillbirth and mortality rate in preweaning pigs farrowed by different gilt breeds. The investigation included first farrowings of 225 Large White (LW) gilts, 297 Swedish Landrace (SL) gilts and 260 crossbreed gilts (LWxSL) in the period of five years. Despite of positive influence of straw through decreased number of stillborn pigs, especially in LW gilts, in further process of production until weaning, less appropriate microclimatic conditions developed in <b>farrowing</b> <b>houses</b> with straw, especially if accompanied with poor ventilation, can result with higher number of perished pigs and lower number of weaned pigs. Most sensible to unsuitable microclimatic conditions in straw bedded <b>farrowing</b> <b>houses,</b> according to the number of perished pigs before weaning, were the pigs from SL gilts, while the pigs from crossbreed gilts LWxSL were the most resistant.

The experiment involved 90 hybrid sows (Czech Large White x Czech Landrace) <b>housed</b> in two <b>farrowing</b> <b>houses</b> with two different types of technology. Each experimental variant involved 45 sows with 45 litters and the aim was to demonstrate the effect of the technology on losses of piglets. One variant (Technology I) was modern and originated from the year 2002 while the other (Technology II) was older (1994). Piglets were weaned in age of 28 days. The obtained results indicate that the overlaying was the most significant cause of piglet losses till the age of 7 days.

One of the methods frequently used to achieve this is to maintain a low room air temperature and provide protection to the piglets by covering the creep area in different ways. However, only limited information is found in literature on the specific thermal consequences of different cover designs. An experiment was conducted with a 0. 6 m by 1. 0 m creep area surrounded by 4 different constructions, each covered with 3 different materials.

Air temperature and black-globe temperature were measured in 9 positions in the creep. Floor panel surface temperature was measured in 2 positions. The results showed that a creep area surrounded only with walls (without roof) created better thermal conditions than 3 walls with roof and open front, what was unexpected. 50 %-covered front improved thermal conditions two times, and 90 %-covered front four times in comparison to cover with open front.

Results from more than 80 studies were identified through a thorough literature search, and the data were compiled together with results from the 11 swine sites in the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). Data across studies were analyzed statistically using the MIXED procedures of SAS. Median emissions rates from swine houses were 2. 78 and 0. 09 kg/year per pig for NH 3 and H 2 S, respectively. Median emissions rates from swine storage facilities were 2. 08 and 0. 20 kg/year per pig for NH 3 and H 2 S, respectively.

The size that may trigger the need for a farm to report NH 3 emissions is 3, 410 pigs based on median NH 3 emissions rates in the literature, but the threshold can be as low as 992 pigs based on 90 th-percentile emissions rates. Swine hoop houses had significantly higher NH 3 emission rates than other manure-handling systems (P < 0. 01), whereas deep pit houses had the highest H 2 S emission rates (P = 0. 03). <b>Farrowing</b> <b>houses</b> had the highest H 2 S emission rates, followed by gestation houses, and finishing houses had lowest H 2 S emission rates (P < 0. 01). Regression models for NH 3 and H 2 S emission rates were developed for finishing houses with deep pits, recharge pits, and lagoons. The NH 3 emission rates increased with increasing air temperature, but effects of air temperature on H 2 S emission rates were not significant. The recharge interval of manure pits significantly affected H 2 S but not NH 3 emission rates. The H 2 S emission rates were also influenced by the size of the operation. Although NH 3 and H 2 S concentrations at the edge of swine houses or lagoons were often higher than corresponding acute or intermediate minimum risk levels (MRLs), they decreased quickly to be less than corresponding chronic or intermediate MRLs as distances from emission sources increase. At distances 30 to 1, 185 m from emission sources, the average ambient concentrations for NH 3 and H 2 S were 66 ± 66 ppb and 3. 1 ± 6. 2 ppb, respectively...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to provide practical {{information concerning the}} frequency of temp. and RH measurements required to obtain a good estimate of their averages and of their daily variations, and to determine the relationships between ammonia, carbon dioxide and bacterial concn in a pig house. Measurements were made in 9 artificially ventilated <b>farrowing</b> or weaner <b>houses</b> with slatted floors. Temp. and RH were measured every 20 min for 7 d. Sensors were placed inside buildings {{in the middle of}} the houses, 0. 8 m above floor level, and outside the buildings. Data were recorded using a datalogger. Ammonia and carbon dioxide concn were measured using 8 h Gastec diffusion tubes. Three readings were taken in the same location at 2 -day intervals. The airborne bacterial concn was measured with a 6 -stage Andersen sampler. Bacteria colony forming particles (BCFP) were collected by impacting onto agar-filled petri dishes which are placed in an incubator for 24 h prior to counting the colonies formed. Results are discussed, indicating no significant correlation between the 3 measures of pollution (NH 3 and CO 2 concn, BCFP levels) despite careful microclimate control. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was accomplished {{on a farm}} with industrial housing of sows and on a family agricultural farm where sows are freely housed, outdoors. Twenty breeding sows from each farm were studied in this research. The experiment was conducted aiming to compare housing of sows, {{as well as those}} factors affecting stress indicators. For this purpose cortisol level was determined five days before farrowing, five days after farrowing and a day after weaning. Besides cortisol, other haematological parameters were determined in the blood, also. Statistically significant higher concentration of cortisol was determined at five days before <b>farrowing</b> in sows <b>housed</b> freely compared to sows housed industrially (p< 0. 05). Five days after farrowing and a day after weaning, concentrations of cortisol were lower in the blood of freely housed sows compared to industrially housed sows. However, the difference was not significant. The level of cortisol determined in sows housed freely during pregnancy, and after dislocation into wedged farrowing departments, five days before farrowing, was significantly higher than in industrial sows. The aforesaid confirmed stress that can be induced by relocating the sows to a new location and wedged space. The level of cortisol, determined in industrial sows was almost of equal values during the whole research, the fact being related to constant stress conditions...|$|R

Sows held in a quarantine unit, and their offspring born in the unit, did not excrete haemolytic E. coli until after they were returned to the piggery. The environment of the piggery was the most likely source of infection for weaned pigs, and routine cleaning and disinfection of the accommodation did not prevent infection.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{automatically}} predict the onset of farrowing in crate-confined sows. (1) Background: Automatic tools are appropriate to support animal surveillance under practical farming conditions. (2) Methods: In three batches, sows in one farrowing compartment of the Futterkamp research farm were equipped with an ear sensor to sample acceleration. As a reference video, recordings of the sows were used. A classical CUSUM chart using different acceleration indices of various distribution characteristics with several scenarios were compared. (3) Results: The increase of activity mainly due to nest building behavior before the onset of farrowing could be detected with the sow individual CUSUM chart. The best performance required a statistical distribution characteristic that represented fluctuations in the signal (for example, 1 st variation) combined with a transformation of this parameter by cumulating differences in the signal within certain time periods from one day to another. With this transformed signal, farrowing sows could reliably be detected. For 100 % or 85 % of the sows, an alarm was given within 48 or 12 h before the onset of farrowing. (4) Conclusions: Acceleration measurements in the ear of a sow are suitable for detecting the onset of <b>farrowing</b> in individually <b>housed</b> sows in commercial farrowing crates...|$|R

The epidemiology of porcine group A rotavirus was studied in commercial herds of pigs in New Zealand. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Dakopatts, Copenhagen) was found to be highly sensitive (100 %) and specific (96. 8 %) for the detection of group A rotavirus in pig faeces when compared to electron microscopy (EM). A highly sensitive and specific ELISA test for the measurement of antibody against group A rotavirus in pigs was also developed. Of 521 faecal samples collected from Massey University Piggery in a cross-sectional survey, 47 (9 %) were positive for group A rotavirus by the ELISA test. Only sucking (19. 3 %) and weaner (14. 4 %) pigs were shedding rotavirus. Rotavirus was not detected in the faeces of fattener pigs (over two months old) or adult pigs including sows and boars. Three cohort studies revealed that all pigs became infected with group A rotavirus before they were 40 days of age and shed the virus for an average of eight days. Some of the piglets shed rotavirus a second time approximately 10 days after the first period of shedding. All piglets ceased to shed the virus by two months of age. Rotaviral shedding was associated with the occurrence of milk scours in sucking piglets. Diarrhoea in weaner pigs (post-weaning diarrhoea, PWD) was more closely associated with the presence of haemolytic E. coli than with rotavirus in faeces. Infection with group A rotavirus was transmitted from piglet to piglet and from litter to litter. In one cohort of 50 piglets from five litters, shedding of rotavirus was first detected in one litter, then in the second litter two days later, and finally in other litters of piglets. Over a period of 16 days, all piglets in the five litters were infected. Group A rotavirus was also detected in dust, faeces and effluent collected from the <b>farrowing</b> and weaner <b>houses,</b> and from a weaner house which had not been used for three months. Rotavirus was not detected in any of the sows (11) during the period of investigation. Neither was rotavirus detected in fattener pigs (from two months of age to the time of slaughter), nor in the environments where old pigs (fattener and sow houses) were housed. It was not therefore possible to confirm that adult pigs, especially sows, act as carriers for rotaviral infection of young piglets as has been suggested by other workers. All the piglets acquired maternal antirotaviral antibody from their dams and the levels of antibody in piglets' sera were comparable to those in the colostrum of their dams. The maternally-derived antibody was also detected in piglets' faeces. Antibody in sera and in faeces declined rapidly after birth. Rotaviral shedding commenced in each of the cohorts when the geometric mean ELISA antibody titre fell below 1 / 1600 (equivalent to serum neutralizing antibody titre of 1 / 8 to 1 / 16). However, this correlation between antibody titres and protection was not observed in individual litters. In each of the cohorts studied, rotaviral shedding was usually detected initially in one or two piglets of a litter. The infection then spread to other piglets within the same litter and, finally, to piglets of other litters in the same group. Onset of rotaviral infection in particular litters was related to their location in the farrowing unit rather than to the levels of antibody. The shedding pattern of group A rotavirus was studied further in another five New Zealand piggeries and was found to be similar to that observed at the Massey University Piggery. Faecal samples from these piggeries were analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and no common electrophoretype of group A rotavirus was found in these piggeries. More than one electrophoretype of group A rotavirus was detected in three of these piggeries. Faecal samples collected from Massey University Piggery were also analyzed by PAGE and it was found that rotaviruses detected during {{the first two years of}} the present investigation had identical electrophoretypes, but one isolate detected in the third year had a distinctively different pattern. Non-group A rotaviruses were also detected for the first time in New Zealand. Nine samples had an electrophoretic pattern similar to that of group C rotavirus and one was similar to that of group B rotavirus. One of the samples containing group C rotavirus was from two litters of piglets with diarrhoea at two to four days of age. In one of these piggeries, five electrophoretypes of rotaviruses representing three groups were detected. These observations indicate that rotaviral infections are important causes of milk scours in piglets, and are probably significant in exacerbating PWD. The epidemiology of rotaviral infections is complicated by a number of factors. These include the continuous transmission of virus from pig to pig and from litter to litter, the survival of the virus in the piggery environment, the incomplete protection afforded by maternally-derived antibody, and the simultaneous circulation of different strains and different groups of rotavirus in one piggery...|$|R
