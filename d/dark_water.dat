25|$|Bubbleworks (originally titled Prof. Burp's BubbleWorks, then Imperial Leather Bubbleworks from 2006) was a <b>dark</b> <b>water</b> ride {{opened in}} 1990 at Chessington World of Adventures Resort in Surrey, England. It took riders through {{animated}} scenes of a comical factory producing fizzy pop. The ride {{was designed by}} the Sparks Group and co-produced by Keith Sparks & John Wardley. The water transit system was manufactured by UK firm Leisurtec Ltd. In 2006 a sponsored refurbishment resulted in the factory theme changing to Imperial Leather toiletries. The ride closed in September 2016, {{and was replaced by}} The Gruffalo River Ride Adventure.|$|E
25|$|The impact {{initially}} {{caused the}} formation of a transient crater with the diameter of about 150km and depth of about 50km, which then relaxed forming the present crater with the final diameter of about 300km. The impact probably penetrated through the <b>dark</b> <b>water</b> poor ejecta of Adlinda and Heimdell, then entered a water ice rich layer beneath it. This explains the distribution of the Lofn's ejecta. The outer rings of impact deposits around Lofn are made from the dark material, which was excavated first and accelerated to a high speed. After that the light water rich material was excavated from the depth, but with a lower speed forming the bright inner ring of ejecta.|$|E

25|$|One common {{feature of}} the myths is the {{emergence}} of the world from the waters of chaos that surround it. This event represents the establishment of maat and the origin of life. One fragmentary tradition centers on the eight gods of the Ogdoad, who represent the characteristics of the primeval water itself. Their actions give rise to the sun (represented in creation myths by various gods, especially Ra), whose birth forms a space of light and dryness within the <b>dark</b> <b>water.</b> The sun rises from the first mound of dry land, another common motif in the creation myths, which was likely inspired by the sight of mounds of earth emerging as the Nile flood receded. With the emergence of the sun god, the establisher of maat, the world has its first ruler. Accounts from the first millennium BC focus on the actions of the creator god in subduing the forces of chaos that threaten the newly ordered world.|$|E
25|$|The broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) is {{the only}} extant member of the genus Notorynchus, in the family Hexanchidae. It is {{recognizable}} because of its seven gill slits, while most shark species have five gill slits, {{with the exception of}} the members of the order Hexanchiformes and the sixgill sawshark. This shark has a large, thick body, with a broad head and blunt snout. The top jaw has jagged, cusped teeth and the bottom jaw has comb-shaped teeth. Its single dorsal fin is set far back along the spine towards the caudal fin, and is behind the pelvic fins. In this shark the upper caudal fin is much longer than the lower, and is slightly notched near the tip. Like many sharks, this sevengill is counter-shaded. Its dorsal surface is silver-gray to brown in order to blend with the <b>dark</b> <b>water</b> and substrate when viewed from above. In counter to this, its ventral surface is very pale, blending with the sunlit water when viewed from below. The body and fins are covered in a scattering of small black & white spots. In juveniles, their fins often have white margins.|$|E
500|$|After {{a two-year}} {{absence from the}} film scene, Connelly {{returned}} in the 2005 horror/psychological thriller <b>Dark</b> <b>Water,</b> {{which was based on}} a 2002 Japanese film of the same name. She played Dahlia, a frightened young woman traumatized by her past, who moves with her daughter to an apartment in New York City where paranormal happenings take place. In his review, critic Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "I cared about the Jennifer Connelly character; she is not a horror heroine but an actress playing a mother faced with horror. There is a difference, and because of that difference, <b>Dark</b> <b>Water</b> works".|$|E

500|$|The Baker shot {{produced}} so many unusual {{phenomena that}} a conference was held {{two months later}} to standardize nomenclature and define new terms for use in descriptions and analysis. The underwater fireball {{took the form of}} a rapidly expanding hot gas bubble that pushed against the water, generating a supersonic hydraulic shock wave which crushed the hulls of nearby ships as it spread out. Eventually it slowed to the speed of sound in water, which is one mile per second (1600m/s), five times faster than that of sound in air. On the surface, the shock wave was visible as the leading edge of a rapidly expanding ring of <b>dark</b> <b>water,</b> called the [...] "slick" [...] for its resemblance to an oil slick. Close behind the slick was a visually more dramatic, but less destructive whitening of the water surface called the [...] "crack".|$|E
500|$|The {{main source}} of the game's horror is Alma, a ghostly little girl. Craig Hubbard remarked that [...] "a guy in a mask chasing co-eds with a meat cleaver can be scary, but on some level you're {{thinking}} to yourself you could probably kick his ass if you got the drop on him...but when a spooky little girl takes out an entire Delta Force squad, how {{are you supposed to}} deal with that?" [...] While Alma has been compared to the character Samara from The Ring, Craig Hubbard stated that she [...] "... was born out of a tradition of eerie, faceless female ghosts ..." [...] and not [...] "... as an answer to any specific movie character." [...] Hubbard acknowledged that Alma [...] "... admittedly bears some visual resemblance to the ghosts in <b>Dark</b> <b>Water</b> or Séance", but [...] "... creepy little girls have been freaking [...] out since The Shining." [...] Developers Dave Matthews and Nathan Hendrickson say the name 'Alma' comes from the character Alma Mobley in Peter Straub's novel Ghost Story.|$|E
500|$|To {{depict the}} supernatural {{aspects of the}} show, the series makes use of visual, special, and make-up effects, as well as stuntwork. Businesses, such as visual effects company Entity FX, were {{contracted}} for production of the pilot episode. Subsequent episodes were filmed in Vancouver and required a new crew that works exclusively for the show. Mary Winchester's death scene, which had the character pinned to the ceiling and burning to death, required actress Samantha Smith to lie on a floor with two propane pipes spouting fire approximately five feet away from her on either side. For the actual burning of the character, a fake body the crew named [...] "Christina" [...] was made out of wire and papier-mâché, and was then ignited on a fake ceiling. However, the room quickly caught fire, forcing an evacuation. Green screen coincided with the visual effects for the ghostly Woman in White, and executive producer McG chose to make the imagery of her death sequence an homage to Chris Cunningham's Aphex Twin video [...] "Windowlicker". Japanese horror also influenced the scene, such as the school uniforms worn by the ghost children, the water cascading down the stairs, and the <b>Dark</b> <b>Water</b> elements.|$|E

500|$|Like in the song, in {{the music}} video Björk is {{depicted}} as [...] "Mother Oceania". The video opens with {{the surface of a}} body of water appearing yellowish and bright. Camera pans down to darker, deeper waters. Björk appears out of the dark background, singing and covered with sparkling jewels. As the second verse begins, images of jellyfish, representing the continents (her children) are thrown from Björk's hands. During the third verse they swim around and away from their mother, carried by the currents, which move in time with the song. In the bridge section, new sea flowers, with brilliant colors, emerge from the background, in contrast to the muted and darker colors of previous scenes. As the fifth verse continues, the camera pans back up to the much lighter surface, not seen {{since the beginning of the}} video. All sorts of marine life are swimming about the surface. Shortly after the sixth verse begins, Bjork is shown in deep, <b>dark</b> <b>water.</b> Several seconds later, the lighter surface of the water is shown without her. When she begins to sing [...] "Your sweat is salty", a somewhat rapid alternation of images ensues: the light surface is shown for one second, followed by Björk singing in the deep water; these scenes alternate until she stops singing during the coda. Björk's vocal repetition ceases at the same time the visual alternation stops. The surface scene recedes, and Björk in the deep water comes to the fore, slowing. At the end of the video, she stands and smiles.|$|E
