5000|$|Yandiyev, {{dressed in}} a Soviet-model {{military}} camouflage uniform, {{can be seen in}} the footage standing injured while Russian soldiers are kicking him and other Chechens in their wounded legs. With television cameras rolling, a top Russian military official then aggressively interrogates Yandiyev before finally ordering his execution. Yandiyev and the Russian quickly get into an argument, and the officer eventually shouts: [...] "Take him away, damn it, finish him off there, shit, - that’s the whole order. Get <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> damn it. Come on, come on, come on, do it, take him away, finish him off, shoot him, damn it..." [...] Yandiyev was then separated from the other prisoners and the soldiers led him away. He has not been seen since.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{handymen}} {{break for}} lunch, the handymen all criticize Brian M's style of leadership: though Brian M tries {{to carry a}} positive attitude, everyone else criticizes him for interfering too much with their assigned tasks. Andrew indicates that over lunch, Brian P would not drop his criticisms of Brian M and, to his face, makes a threatening statement (which was not repeated). Andrew only states that [...] "what Brian P says next is not suitable for a Discovery Channel show about handiwork. All {{you need to know}} about what was said is that the rest of Canada's Worst Handymen no longer wanted to work with Brian P". The comment is not taken lightly by the other four contestants, who all agree that he had crossed a line. After lunch, in the privacy room, all four of the other nominees are calling for Brian P's removal from the Handyman Rehabilitation Centre over the remark. Eric, despite having actually sided with Brian P in the argument, states, [...] "Get <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here,</b> right? 'Cuz there's no room for that." [...] Brian M states, [...] "Unacceptable... Cart him away." [...] Johnnie states, [...] "This guy can't stay." [...] Angie states, [...] "I think his leaving would be a wise decision." ...|$|E

5000|$|In early June 1951, Mrs. DeRose, {{who owned}} an {{apartment}} building at 6139-42 W. 19th Street in Cicero, got into a controversy with her tenants and was ordered to refund {{a portion of the}} rent. Afterwards, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> anger and/or profit, she rented an apartment to Harvey E. Clark Jr., an African-American World War II veteran and graduate of Fisk University, and his family in an all-white neighborhood. A high Cicero official learned that an African-American family was moving into a Cicero apartment and warned Mrs. DeRose that there would be [...] "trouble" [...] if he moved in. At 2:30 pm, on June 8, a moving van containing $2000 worth of Clark's furniture was stopped by the police. The rental agent was ushered out with a drawn revolver at his back. A jeering crowd gathered and Clark was told by the police to get out or he would be arrested [...] "for protective custody." [...] A detective warned Clark that, [...] "I'll bust your damned head if you don't move." [...] At 6:00 pm, Clark was grabbed by 20 police officers. The chief of police told <b>him,</b> [...] "Get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here</b> fast. There will be no moving into this building." [...] Clark was hit eight times as he was pushed towards a car which was parked across the street and was shoved inside the car. The police told <b>him,</b> [...] "Get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Cicero and don't come back in town or you'll get a bullet through you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Captain Lister {{looked at}} him earnestly. [...] "I think you will do, youngster," [...] he said approvingly, [...] "that is the right spirit. There {{is a lot of}} rough fun and larking in a regiment, and the man that goes through it best, is he who can take a joke good-temperedly {{as long as it does}} not go beyond the bounds of moderation, but who is ready to resent any wilful insult: but I think you would be very wise to do as you say. Half an hour in a pistol-gallery every day is likely to be of vastly more use to you than any amount of Russian. The {{reputation}} that a man is a crack shot with a pistol will do more than anything in the world to keep <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> quarrels. <b>Here</b> at the depôt at any rate, where the fellows are for the most part young, it would certainly save you a good deal of annoyance if it were known that, although not by any means a quarrelsome fellow, you were determined to put up with nothing beyond good-humoured jokes. Well, lad, I don't want to interfere with your hobby, only I advise you not to ride it too hard, at any rate at first. When the men all know you and get to like you, and see that, apart from this fancy of yours, you are an all-round good fellow, as I can see you are, they will let you go your own way. At any rate, as captain of your troop, I will do all I can to make things pleasant for you, but don't forget about the pistol practice. At a depôt like this, where there are half a dozen regiments represented, you will meet with a larger proportion of disagreeable men than you would in your own ante-room. You see, if colonels have such men, they are glad enough to rid the regiment of them by leaving them at the depôt, and any serious trouble is more likely to come from one of them than from anyone in your own regiment." ...|$|R
50|$|The act is {{interrupted}} when Larry mistakes a toupée for a tarantula and Moe subsequently takes the guard's gun and starts shooting the toupée, causing pandemonium in the court. After the song ends, Curley slaps Moe {{on the back}} and makes him swallow is harmonica, briefly turning him into a musical instrument that Larry and Curley play a song with before Curley helps Moe spit the harmonica back out. Curly is chewing gum and sternly told by the judge to get rid of it. He throws it away, but accidentally hits Moe in the face. Larry then takes a napkin and removes the gum, twisting Moe's nose in pain. Larry then stomps on it and bellows out in a loud exaggerated Tarzan yell. Moe slaps him and tells <b>him</b> to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>here.</b> After everything is brought under control, Moe and Curly re-enact the actual murder (with Curly on the receiving end). Moe then looks at the parrot, who was at the murder scene, and sees a note tied to the parrot's foot. He opens the parrot cage, and the parrot flies out. The Stooges eventually capture the bird by shooting water at it through a fire hose. Moe then reads the letter out loud and reveals that it is a confession from the real murderer, Buck Wing, which proves Gail's innocence. The note also said that Buck Wing will disappear. Just when {{they are going to get}} their picture taken at the front page, the water hose (which had to be tied in a knot to stop the flow of water when the bailiff broke the fixture trying to turn it off) explodes, wetting all in attendance.|$|R
