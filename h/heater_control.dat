50|$|McGalliard was the {{inventor}} of the Solidstat, a single mount electrical control assembly, and issued a U.S. patent February 8, 1978. The Solidstat is widely used for: resistance <b>heater</b> <b>control,</b> lighting control, motor speed control, pipe heating, tank & kettle heating, laminating press <b>heater</b> <b>control,</b> and medical equipment involving heating, lighting, and temperature controls. A single mounting connection at the potentiometer bushing not only mechanically mounts all of the elements but additionally provides a heat sink connection for the circuit. At the same time, the use of a printed circuit board in the combination permits automated assembly and soldering which substantially reduced the cost of the circuit.|$|E

50|$|There are two {{configurations}} for {{the chamber}} assembly, {{with the only}} difference being the plugs. The uninstrumented configuration has a top plug which is used for installation of the samples and to support the inert gas lines and maintain a leak tight environment while under water.

The goal is to provide a retrofit outline for the purpose of reducing the energy consumption and maximizing the heat recovery leading to reduce the capital investment.

50|$|For {{extraordinary}} achievement while piloting {{air mail}} plane No. 408H on April 21, 1933, during a night flight from Washington, D.C. to Detroit, Mich. At {{an altitude of}} 3200 feet and about half way to Pittsburgh, PA., with no warning whatsoever the left outboard engine of the tri-motored plane crashed from the ship. Pilot Carmichael adjusted the controls to return the plane to a level position {{and turned back to}} Washington. In breaking from the ship the left engine had pulled the outboard <b>heater</b> <b>control</b> open and effected the center engine altitude adjustment. The center engine cut out until the altitude control was discovered and readjusted. Realizing that he had about 100 miles to fly in returning to Washington, the pilot climbed to an altitude of 4500 feet in order not to overheat the remaining two engines on the plane. A survey of the damage was made from the cockpit window {{with the aid of a}} flashlight, from which it was determined that the landing gear had been damaged. The pilot, therefore, decided that a landing should be made at Bolling Field, which is larger than the Washington Airport, and would be more advantageous for the one-wheel type of landing which would have to be made with damaged landing gear. He also desired to avail himself of the trained Army personnel and their emergency equipment, including ambulances and fire trucks. The pilot made all arrangements for landing by radio communication and received the fullest cooperation from the Bolling Field authorities. A one-wheel landing was made with little additional damage to the ship and no injury to passengers and mail.|$|E
50|$|The VK Regal {{also had}} blinker {{repeaters}} housed in small chrome boxes which sat {{on top of}} both front guards. Another unusual option was the Fuel Pacer option from the Chrysler US parts bin which detected low engine vacuum - as under hard acceleration - and illuminated the driver side guardtop blinker repeater to indicate wasteful driving. Inertia-reel seatbelts and slightly different <b>heater</b> <b>controls</b> were introduced on the VK, {{as well as a}} combination control stalk for the lights and wipers from the Mitsubishi Galant. The Ranger also got full-length door trims, and carpet was now standard.|$|R
50|$|In energy {{efficiency}} buildings such as Passive House, R-2000 or Net Zero Energy, simple thermostatic radiator valves {{can be installed}} along with a single compact circulator and small condensing <b>heater</b> <b>controlled</b> without or with basic hot water reset control. Economical electric resistance based systems also are useful in small zones such as bathrooms and kitchens, but also for entire buildings where heating loads are very low. Larger structures will need more sophisticated systems to deal with cooling and heating needs, and often require building management control systems to regulate the energy use and control the overall indoor environment.|$|R
40|$|A multivariable thermal {{system with}} two inputs and two outputs is investigated. Its inputs are {{a pair of}} <b>heaters</b> <b>controlled</b> by a {{computer}} while its outputs are temperatures measured by two sensors. The system is fully interactive so two different controller structures {{can be used to}} ensure that the temperatures track their respective set-points. Both are multivariable controllers though one has a diagonal structure while the other has a triangular structure. Multi-objective optimization with a posteriori decision-making based on Pareto efficiency, level diagrams, hyper volumes and other performance indices is used to compare quantitatively the two controller structures when applied to a highly interactive multivariable system based on this plant...|$|R

Continuing in production until 1969, this version came in saloon and, from 1965, estate forms. The estate, its body shell partly built by Carbodies, was in the Mk 1 version the same length as the saloon. Various minor improvements were made during the period of which the most noteworthy, probably, was a significant upgrade in October 1966 to the [...] "previously rather ineffective" [...] ventilation, with eyeball vents added in the centre of the facia and the <b>heater</b> <b>controls</b> repositioned beneath them.|$|R
50|$|Small vacuum motors {{were also}} used to operate {{windscreen}} wipers in automobiles. In this case, the motors were powered by manifold vacuum. This arrangement was not very satisfactory because, if the throttle were wide open, the wipers would slow down, or even stop. Modern automobiles use electrically powered wipers. Modern automobiles still use a vacuum motor of a kind, however, the vacuum servo. Brakes are operated by a hydraulic system, but they use a ‘vacuum motor’ to amplify the force provided by the driver. Small vacuum motors {{were also used}} from the late 1960s to control servomechanisms such as door locks, <b>heater</b> <b>controls</b> or movable bonnet ventilation flaps.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As the {{improvement}} of the modern workshop’s demand for cool supply, heating system, how to effectively manage the air-conditioning equipments to satisfy the production skills for air-conditioning system has become an important subject for modern workshop design.
