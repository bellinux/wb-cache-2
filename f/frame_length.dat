5|$|The LSWR M7 {{class is}} {{a class of}} 0-4-4 {{passenger}} tank locomotive built between 1897 and 1911. The class was designed by Dugald Drummond for use on the intensive London network of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR), and performed well in such tasks. Because of their utility, 105 were built and the class went through several modifications over five production batches. For this reason there were detail variations such as <b>frame</b> <b>length.</b> Many of the class were fitted with push-pull operation gear that enabled efficient use on branch line duties without the need to change {{to the other end}} of its train at the end of a journey.|$|E
25|$|Wheelbase is the {{horizontal}} {{distance between the}} centers (or the ground contact points) of {{the front and rear}} wheels. Wheelbase is a function of rear <b>frame</b> <b>length,</b> steering axis angle, and fork offset. It is similar to the term wheelbase used for automobiles and trains.|$|E
25|$|The SD50's long hood saw {{changes from}} {{previous}} EMD models. The overall <b>frame</b> <b>length</b> was increased, {{and the long}} hood was made substantially longer. The resistors for the dynamic brake grid were moved from their previous location above the prime mover to a new, cooler location {{in front of the}} engine compartment air intakes, where they were more effectively separated {{from the rest of the}} locomotives' systems, and also closer to the locomotive's electrical switchgear, thereby simplifying the prime mover maintenance procedures, and the electrical system as well.|$|E
30|$|The best-fitted {{candidate}} {{in the sense of}} the energy test for all phoneme classes in T, RDFT, IDFT, and DCT features with different <b>frame</b> <b>lengths</b> was either MLD or MGLD (with p[*]∈[*]{ 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 }). In particular for <b>frame</b> <b>lengths</b> of 20 and 30 ms, which are mostly exploited in speech processing, either MLD or MGLD with p[*]=[*] 0.75 dominated. As a consequence, the Laplace distribution contributes more compared to the Gaussian distribution in the statistical multivariate modeling of T, RDFT, IDFT, and DCT features with short <b>frame</b> <b>lengths.</b>|$|R

500|$|The basic {{layout of}} the class was {{influenced}} by the existing ‘’Lord Nelson’’ class 4-6-0 design, but the use of the round topped firebox enabled Maunsell to design the cab's curved profile to fit the gauge restrictions of the Hastings line while allowing adequate forward visibility. The short <b>frame</b> <b>length</b> of the 4-4-0 locomotive also meant very little overhang on the line's tight curves. To maintain the high power rating required for express passenger engines, Maunsell opted for a three-cylinder design. In terms of tractive effort, the class was the most powerful 4-4-0 ever built in Britain, and were the only 4-4-0 type to be given the power classification of 5P by British Railways. They were well liked by crews. They also had a higher tractive effort than the nominally more powerful King Arthur class 4-6-0s, but at the cost of high axle-loading: [...] The permanent way on the Hastings line therefore had to be upgraded during 1929 and 1930 to accept the new locomotive.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "paradox", as it were, {{comes from}} the way that Bell {{constructed}} his example. In the usual discussion of Lorentz contraction, the rest length is fixed and the moving length shortens as measured in frame [...] As shown in Fig.4‑5, Bell's example asserts the moving lengths [...] and [...] measured in frame [...] to be fixed, thereby forcing the rest <b>frame</b> <b>length</b> [...] in frame [...] to increase.|$|E
2500|$|The {{increase}} in the <b>frame</b> <b>length</b> between the preceding 40 Series and the 40-2 Series six-axle locomotives was made to accommodate the new HT-C truck design, in which the traction motors all face the same direction, making the trucks longer. [...] After a series of derailments involving Amtrak SDP40F units that were equipped with [...] "hollow bolster" [...] HT-C trucks, applied only to the SDP40F, Conrail ordered the SD40-2 units and several orders of SD50s with the older Flexicoil trucks, but the HT-C truck was vindicated and it ultimately went under most 40 Series, 50 Series and 60 Series six-axle locomotives, and this truck is still found under many remanufactured locomotives.|$|E

30|$|The best-fitted {{candidate}} for the MFCC with different <b>frame</b> <b>lengths</b> is MGD, consistent with the assumption of multivariate Gaussian distribution used in most speech recognition algorithms [2, 3].|$|R
2500|$|As the SD38, SD39, SD40, and SD45 {{shared a}} common frame, so too did the SD38-2, SD40-2, and SD45-2. It was [...] longer than the {{previous}} models, giving a length of [...] over the coupler pulling faces. The SD38-2 and SD40-2 shared the same basic superstructure, since they used the same 16-645 engine (in Roots-blown and turbocharged form respectively); the long hood was [...] longer than the SD38 and SD40, but since the increase in <b>frame</b> <b>length</b> was even greater, the SD38-2 and SD40-2 had even larger front and rear [...] "porches" [...] than the earlier models. These empty areas at front and rear are spotting features to identify the Dash 2 models of both units. The SD40-2 can be distinguished from the SD38-2 by its three roof-mounted radiator fans instead of two, and a single large exhaust stack instead of two smaller stacks.|$|E

These include the effect of the interleaver length, the interaction between the interleaver and the number of decoding iterations, and the effect of interchanging the interleaver between input and output. Simulation results show that some types of the interleavers can be very competitive to random interleaver for different <b>frame</b> <b>lengths...</b>|$|R
40|$|Distributed video {{applications}} are an emerging area of our modern information society. They process video data streams produced by video encoders. This processing imposes high storage and throughput requirements on computer and communication systems. For instance real-time video communication like video conferencing does not perform very favorable when run over a best-effort network like the Internet. Because of data losses or high delays as consequences of congestions and bottlenecks the service offered {{by such a}} video application can deteriorate. To support the solution of such problems this paper presents {{a study of the}} output process of video encoders to quantify and characterize the requirements of video applications. In particular we investigate the traffic characteristics of H. 26 x-encoded video streams. First this paper presents measurements of the <b>frame</b> <b>lengths</b> and their empirical distributions. Then the empirical distributions were approximated by normal distributions. It follows an investigation of autocorrelations of <b>frame</b> <b>lengths.</b> Finally we discuss the inuences of frame skip, quantization, and redundant I-framing on video streams. These mechanisms can be used to reconcile the size of the video stream and the picture quality of the video, especially in case of real-time video communication over IP...|$|R
