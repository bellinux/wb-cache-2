2500|$|At , {{the engines}} {{were still at}} idle power. Power {{settings}} for jet engines are expressed in instrument readings and flight data recorders as percentages labeled as [...] "N1" [...] and [...] "N2". N1 and N2 refer to the spools, or shafts, of a jet engine on which the compressor and turbine blades are mounted; jet engine power is measured {{as a percentage of}} maximum N1 or N2 rpm. Although the shafts are not mechanically connected, the speed of one spool can be calculated based on the speed of the other spool and atmospheric conditions. The Tu-154 manual indicates that a go-around must be initiated at 200 m if the engines are running at or below 75% N2. This is because jet engine throttle response is not linear; jet engines have to [...] "spool up" [...] in order to produce more thrust. At power settings higher than 78%, this response is almost instantaneous; at idle power, it can take a full 8 seconds for a jet engine to [...] "spool up" [...] to full power. On PLF 101, the N2 values were not recorded by the flight data recorder (FDR). The N1 values were, and at 200 m they indicated 32%-33% N1. 75% N2 equates to 51%-52% N1 for the given conditions. As such, the engines were well below the 75% minimum N2 reading, and the crew should have initiated a go-around at this point, even though they were still above Minimum <b>Decision</b> <b>Altitude</b> (MDA). However, they did not go around, and continued the descent. The Final Report would later determine that a go-around was technically possible from as low as 40 m, but that 200 m was the first of many times that the crew were required to go around, but did not.|$|E

40|$|Synthetic {{vision is}} a computer-generated {{image of the}} {{external}} scene topography that is generated from aircraft attitude, high-precision navigation information, and data of the terrain, obstacles, cultural features, and other required flight information. A synthetic vision system (SVS) enhances this basic functionality with real-time integrity to ensure {{the validity of the}} databases, perform obstacle detection and independent navigation accuracy verification, and provide traffic surveillance. Over the last five years, NASA and its industry partners have developed and deployed SVS technologies for commercial, business, and general aviation aircraft which have been shown to provide significant improvements in terrain awareness and reductions in the potential for Controlled-Flight-Into-Terrain incidents/accidents compared to current generation cockpit technologies. It has been hypothesized that SVS displays can greatly improve the safety and operational flexibility of flight in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) to a level comparable to clear-day Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC), regardless of actual weather conditions or time of day. An experiment was conducted to evaluate SVS and SVS-related technologies as well as the influence of where the information is provided to the pilot (e. g., on a Head-Up or Head-Down Display) for consideration in defining landing minima based upon aircraft and airport equipage. The "operational considerations" evaluated under this effort included reduced visibility, <b>decision</b> <b>altitudes,</b> and airport equipage requirements, such as approach lighting systems, for SVS-equipped aircraft. Subjective results from the present study suggest that synthetic vision imagery on both head-up and head-down displays may offer benefits in situation awareness; workload; and approach and landing performance in the visibility levels, approach lighting systems, and <b>decision</b> <b>altitudes</b> tested...|$|R
2500|$|At , the [...] "terrain ahead!" [...] warning again sounded on {{the flight}} deck. The crew {{continued}} the descent. According to MAK's report, at [...] (Decision Height) there was no [...] "landing" [...] or [...] "go-around" [...] call by the captain. If this happens, the first officer is supposed to overrule the captain, {{take control of the}} airplane, and initiate a go-around. Poland suggests that at this point the captain said [...] "Go around", and 8 seconds later the first officer confirmed by saying [...] "go around". (only the second of these two statements is recorded in the official transcripts by MAK; the first one may have been obscured by a simultaneous report by TAWS). Despite these calls, neither pilot initiated a go-around, and the descent continued. [...] One second after the 100 m altitude was reached, the TAWS alert [...] "PULL UP" [...] activated and continued to sound {{for the remainder of the}} flight. [...] "PULL UP" [...] only activates when the TAWS computer believes a collision with terrain is imminent. Therefore, when [...] "PULL UP" [...] sounds, the crew is supposed to begin an immediate, maximum performance emergency climb (full power and angle of attack to the maximum permissible without stalling) and continue climbing until the warning stops. However, the crew continued the descent. In a typical situation with an airport in the TAWS database, the [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning might not have sounded at this point. There is a method of setting up the TAWS to prevent false warnings when flying into airports not in the database, known as [...] "terrain inhibit" [...] mode; however, the crew did not utilize it. Even if they had, an excessive rate of descent and excessive airspeed can cause the TAWS to issue a [...] "SINK RATE" [...] warning followed by a [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning. This point (10:40:40 local time, approximately 20 seconds before the collision with terrain) is also notable because this was the moment when the aircraft had crossed the minimum allowed approach slope for this airport (2°10'). Prior to this moment, the radar controller had no reason to think that the landing attempt was not proceeding normally. The behavior of the controller was later the subject of some criticism by the Polish media. The controller remained silent for about 12 seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 m mark, and, even at that point, he did not order a go-around, but, rather issued an instruction to transit from a descent to a horizontal flight. (The decision to go around was apparently reached in the cabin of the aircraft within a few seconds of that instruction.) In addition, according to some interpretations of the radio exchange between the ground and the aircraft, the crew was instructed by the ground control to descend to [...] and either to wait for clearance to land or request one explicitly, or to inform the ground control regarding their decision whether to land or to go around. (According to MAK's report, it meant that the crew was supposed to inform the ground control of their decision to land before passing the <b>decision</b> <b>altitude,</b> and that the ground control was supposed to allow the landing as long as the runway and the airspace were clear.) None of this ever happened, with the aircraft continuing the descent through the 120 m mark while the ground control remained silent. It is unknown whether the crew really understood the ground control instruction (literally, [...] "landing additionally, 120, 3 m"), which was issued in Russian and used a relatively recent expression that was only codified in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Nigeria Accident Investigation Bureau finally {{concluded}} that the probable cause of the crash {{was due to the}} crew's decision to continue the approach beyond the <b>Decision</b> <b>Altitude</b> without having the runway in sight.

Four obsta-cle removal methods are considered to assess the challenges faced by the SATS Program in providing LLM capabilities to 3, 416 U. S. airports. Two views of runway obstacle analysis are presented: a critical object analysis and a detailed multiobject analysis that includes terrain informa-tion. A comparison is made between <b>decision</b> <b>altitudes</b> (DAs) derived by approach lighting infrastructure and glide path angle thresholds and DA values considering other airport characteristics such as terrain.

40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted to examine electromechanical ight instrumentation for use on curved precision approaches to a landing. Horizontal and vertical path tracking situation information and ight guidance during manually controlled ight in the microwave landing system (MLS) signal environment were examined during this study. These approach paths were contained within the signal coverage area of the time-referenced scanning beam MLS as speci ed by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The data from these tests indicated that ight director guidance is required for the manually controlled ight of a jet transport airplane on curved approach paths. Acceptable path tracking performance was attained with each of three situation information algorithms tested. However, pilot comments indicated that during turns the use of lateral tracking situation information based on capturing the next straight path segment may not be acceptable, since full-scale lateral deviation indications normally resulted during turns. Pilot comments indicated that two of the three curved approach paths tested could be used in normal airline operations. They felt that the third approach path would be acceptable if the <b>decision</b> height <b>altitude</b> and the visibility minimums were greater.

5000|$|By {{following}} controller {{commands to}} keep the landing aircraft on both glidepath and approach centerline, a pilot will arrive precisely over the runway's touchdown zone.

In order to land, pilots must have the runway or runway environment in sight prior to reaching the [...] "decision height," [...] for PAR approaches (usually 100-400 ft above the runway touchdown zone) or prior to the [...] "Missed Approach Point" [...] for non-precision approaches. The published minimum visibility and <b>decision</b> height/minimum descent <b>altitude</b> vary depending upon the approach and runway lighting, obstacles in the approach corridor, type of aircraft, and other factors. Pilots of revenue flights periodically must demonstrate PAR approach proficiency, and GCA controllers must conduct a minimum number of such approaches in a year to maintain competency.|$|R

50|$|ICAO defines {{decision}} altitude/decision height as {{a specified}} altitude or height (A/H) in the precision approach {{at which a}} missed approach must be initiated if the required visual reference to continue the approach has not been established. A decision height (DH) or <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> (DA) is a specified lowest height or altitude in the approach descent at which, if the required visual reference to continue the approach (such as the runway markings or runway environment) is not visible to the pilot, the pilot must initiate a missed approach. The specific values for DH and/or DA at a given airport are established with intention to allow a pilot sufficient time to safely re-configure an aircraft to climb and execute the missed approach procedures while avoiding terrain and obstacles. A DH/DA denotes the altitude in which a missed approach procedure must be started, it does not preclude the aircraft from dipping below the prescribed DH/DA. A decision height is measured AGL (above ground level) while a <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> is measured above MSL (mean sea level). They are used for precision approaches.|$|E

40|$|An {{earthquake}} (MJMA 6. 1), {{occurred in}} December 14, 2004, at southern area of Rumoi sub-prefecture, northern Hokkaido, Japan. The earthquake intensity {{was assumed to}} 6 in Obira town. In Hokkaido, {{this is the first}} inland earthquake larger than M 6 since Teshikaga earthquake (MJMA 6. 5, 1967). Detailed aftershock distribution shows that the aftershocks occur on an eastward dipping plane of 10 km square, depth of which 5 km. The mainshock assumed to have occurred near the southern end of this plane. Despite the sparseness of existing gravity stations over the focal region, {{it was found that the}} aftershocks occur just above the gravitational rise of about 20 mGals. So the gravity survey was operated in Nov. 2005 to Aug. 2006, to make a detailed Bouguer anomaly map and to explicate the subsurface structure of the focal region. The measurement was done with CG- 3 type gravimeter. Measurement positions were carefully decided by operating differential GPS observation. The accuracy of <b>altitude</b> <b>decision</b> is within 1 meter in all of the measurement points. Besides, data provided by Japan Petroleum Exploration Co. Ltd. was very helpful. The appropriate assumed density was detected to 2300 kg/m 3, using density log of deep borehole near the focal region, and the correlations of gravity correction terms. The Bouguer anomaly map by current dataset also shows good coincidence with aftershock distribution...|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} an eyewitness of the crash. The eyewitness was a Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) security guard stationed about 1 km from the runway. He stated that the conditions at the airport were dark skies and light precipitation. He saw the aircraft coming and stated that the aircraft was not stable as it passed over him. He further stated that the approach lights were not on and everywhere was dark and raining. Seconds later, he heard a loud bang, with fire and thick smoke. Another eyewitness, a Sosoliso Airlines pilot departing to Enugu, also reported adverse weather condition in the airport. Firemen in the airport handling the crash also stated bad weather conditions were present, and {{they were forced to}} reposition their equipment due to high wind. This implies that the flight crew wasn't prepared to execute a missed approach at the <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> as the aircraft descended below the <b>decision</b> <b>altitude.</b> Apparently, the crew didn't follow the right procedure for a missed approach. Even if they conducted a recovery from adverse weather associated with windshear, the procedure adopted by the crew was improper.|$|E
50|$|From the CVR data, 16 {{seconds before}} the crash, the Captain called for a go-around, gear up and flaps before the crash. A warning horn then sounded {{followed}} by a 'too low gear' aural sound. Apparently, the pilots had difficulty in sighting the runway and should have carried a missed approach on the <b>Decision</b> <b>Altitude</b> of 307 ft instead of continuing descent below 204 ft. The flaps were retracted and the gear was extended. But the gear was locked. The 'too low gear' warning then appeared again, and a Ground Proximity Warning System followed.|$|E
50|$|From the FDR data, it was {{revealed}} that the flight was uneventful until its final approach. Thirty seconds before the crash, the aircraft descended for seven seconds and leveled off at an altitude of 204 ft, which was below the <b>Decision</b> <b>Altitude</b> of 307 ft. The airspeed then decreased to 145 knots. A few seconds later, there was an increase of speed to 151 knots, indicating that flight crew called for a go-around and initiated it. However, the aircraft had descended well below 204 ft and headed to the left. The crew was unable to recover the plane, and the data ceased functioning when the aircraft speed was at 160 knots.|$|E
50|$|The {{approach}} minimums for LNAV {{approaches are}} {{higher than that of}} ILS approaches, and RNAV approaches that incorporate vertical guidance. Aircraft executing an LNAV instrument approach must descend incrementally rather than follow a fixed glide slope. This is called a 'non-precision' approach to distinguish it from a precision approach in which there is electronic vertical (slope) guidance down to a <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> (DA). In the case of the non-precision approach, the aircraft can descend only to what is referred to as a minimum descent altitude (MDA). An MDA segment is flown until the airport is in sight and the pilot can land. If the airport is not in sight by the time the pilot reaches a missed approach point (MAP) on the MDA, the aircraft must execute a missed approach.|$|E
50|$|The MDA {{states the}} minimum {{altitude}} in MSL to safely fly above any obstructions or terrain {{in the final}} approach flight-path before visual contact with the runway is made. Unlike a DA in a Precision Approach, an MDA requires that after crossing the Final Approach Fix, the pilot is to descend and maintain MDA until the non-flying pilot reports that the runway is in sight, allowing the pilot to safely complete the landing visually. In contrast to the ILS approach, which displays lateral and vertical position, the VOR/DME approach only shows the lateral position of the aircraft and its range to the runway. Due to increased azimuth error {{associated with the use}} of VORs and lack of vertical guidance (Glide Slope), the MDA is therefore much higher than a DA (<b>Decision</b> <b>Altitude)</b> for an ILS.|$|E

The face plate sports sections prominently marked with yellow and red respectively, signifying the recommended deployment altitude, as well as emergency procedure <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> (commonly known as [...] "hard deck").

50|$|IAP charts are {{aeronautical}} charts that {{portray the}} aeronautical data {{that is required}} to execute an instrument approach to an airport. Besides depicting topographic features, hazards and obstructions, they depict the procedures and airport diagram. Each procedure chart uses {{a specific type of}} electronic navigation system such as an NDB, TACAN, VOR, ILS/MLS and RNAV. The chart name reflects the primary navigational aid (NAVAID), if {{there is more than one}} straight-in procedure or if it is just a circling-only procedure. A communication strip on the chart lists frequencies in the order they are used. Minimum, maximum and mandatory altitudes are depicted in addition to the minimum safe altitude (MSA) for emergencies. A cross depicts the final approach fix (FAF) altitude on NPAs while a lightning bolt does the same for PAs. NPAs depict the MDA while a PA shows both the <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> (DA) and decision height (DH). Finally, the chart depicts the missed approach procedures in plan and profile view, besides listing the steps in sequence.|$|E
50|$|Precision {{approach}} radar (PAR) {{is a type}} of radar {{guidance system}} designed to provide lateral and vertical guidance to an aircraft pilot for landing, until the landing threshold is reached. After the aircraft reaches the decision height (DH) or <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> (DA), guidance is advisory only. Controllers monitoring the PAR displays observe each aircraft's position and issue instructions to the pilot that keep the aircraft on course and glidepath during final approach. It is similar to an instrument landing system (ILS) but requires control instructions. One type of instrument approach that can make use of PAR is the ground-controlled approach (GCA). Air traffic controllers must transmit a minimum of every 5 seconds to the pilot their relation to the azimuth portion and, once intercepting the glidepath, their elevation. The approach is terminated when the aircraft reaches the OCA/H (Obstacle Clearance Altitude/Height). Nevertheless, information is provided till threshold and aircraft may be monitored by controller till touchdown. Controller in charge of PAR should not be responsible for any duty other than the PAR approach concerned.|$|E
5000|$|Flight 3597 had {{originally}} been scheduled to land on runway 14, the main landing runway at Zürich, a runway equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS) that provides vertical and lateral guidance to the runway. The CVR records Lutz and Loehrer discussing [...] "the 14 approach" [...] as well as Lutz's request that Loehrer call out the height when the plane reaches 100 feet above DA (<b>Decision</b> <b>Altitude</b> - The altitude at which an immediate decision to land or initiate a missed approach must be made). However, Flight 3597 was behind schedule and would not reach Zürich until after 22:00 CET. This delay forced Flight 3597 to change its landing plan. Zürich Air Traffic Control Tower, in order {{to comply with a}} new Swiss law designed to reduce airport noise from approaching aircraft over southern Germany in the late evening hours, must redirect all flights on final approach to switch from the ILS-equipped runway 14 to the less-accurate VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR)/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME)-equipped runway 28. This runway change forced Captain Lutz to abandon his planned ILS approach and required First Officer Loehrer to consult the Jeppesen charts for runway 28. The charts included a new set of approach parameters, of which the higher MDA (Minimum Descent Altitude) was the most crucial piece of information.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{installations}} include medium- or high-intensity {{approach light}} systems (abbreviated ALS). Most often, these are at larger airports but many small general aviation airports in the U.S. have approach lights {{to support their}} ILS installations and obtain low-visibility minimums. The ALS assists the pilot in transitioning from instrument to visual flight, and to align the aircraft visually with the runway centerline. Pilot observation of the approach lighting system at the <b>Decision</b> <b>Altitude</b> allows the pilot to continue descending towards the runway, even if the runway or runway lights cannot be seen, since the ALS counts as runway end environment. In the U.S., an ILS without approach lights may have CAT I ILS visibility minimums as low as 3/4 mile (runway visual range of 4,000 feet) if the required obstacle clearance surfaces are clear of obstructions. Visibility minimums of 1/2 mile (runway visual range of 2,400 feet) are possible with a CAT I ILS approach supported by a 1400 to 3000 ft ALS, and 3/8 mile visibility 1800 ft visual range is possible if the runway has high-intensity edge lights, touchdown zone and centerline lights, and an ALS that is at least 2400 ft long (see Table 3-5a in FAA Order 8260.3b). In effect, ALS extends the runway environment out towards the landing aircraft and allows low-visibility operations. CAT II and III ILS approaches generally require complex high-intensity approach light systems, while medium-intensity systems are usually paired with CAT I ILS approaches. At many non-towered airports, the pilot controls the lighting system; for example, the pilot can key the microphone 7 times {{to turn on the}} lights on the high intensity, 5 times to medium intensity or 3 times for low intensity ...|$|E

It {{is used in the}} third segment to maintain the minimum <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> while assessing the approach situation.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a concept of}} operations for the use of Synthetic Vision System (SVS) display technology with Category (CAT) I, straight in instrument landing system (ILS) approach. A concept is proposed which extends the current authorization available under Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91. 175 of the Federal Air Regulations (FAR) to begin descent from the published <b>Decision</b> <b>Altitude</b> (DA), based on visual sighting of approach lights. It is proposed that an extended runway centerline feature displayed on an SVS could be substituted for visual contact with the approach lights, as authorized in 91. 175, 1 as long as this information is cross checked with the ILS signal. It requires the use of ILS signals for navigation down to 100 ft height above altitude (HAT), which is available for many ILS installations. Descent below 100 ft HAT would not be allowed unless other visual cues associated with the runway environment are clearly visible and identifiable by the pilot. Issues and areas for future research to support this concept of operations are presented...|$|E
40|$|In-flight {{evaluations}} of a pursuit guidance display system for manually flown precision instrument approaches were performed. The guidance system was {{integrated into the}} RASCAL JUH- 60 A Black Hawk helicopter. The applicability of the pursuit guidance disp 1 aFs to the operation of Runway Independent Aircraft (RIA) is made evident because the displays allow the pilot to fly a complex, multi-segment, descending, decelerating approach trajectory. The complex trajectory chosen for this in-flight assessment began from a downwind abeam position at 110 knots and was hand-flown to a 50 ft <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> at 40 knots using a rate-command/attitude-hold plus turn-coordination control system. The elements of the pursuit guidance format displayed on a 10 -inch liquid crystal display (LCD) flat panel consisted of a flightpath vector and a "leader" aircraft as the pursuit guidance element. Approach guidance was based primarily on carrier-phase differential Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation, and secondarily on both medium accuracy inertial navigation unit states and air data computer states. Required Navigation Performance (RNP) concepts were applied {{to the construction of}} display elements such as lateral/vertical deviation indicators and a tunnel that indicated to the pilot, in real-time, the performance with respect to RNP error bounds. The results of the flight {{evaluations of}} the guidance display show that precise path control for operating within tight RNP boundaries (RNP 0. 007 NM/ 24 ft for initial approach, RNP 0. 008 NM/ 19 ft for intermediate approach, and RNP 0. 002 NM/ 9 ft for final approach) is attainable with minimal to moderate pilot workload...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic Vision Systems and Enhanced Flight Vision System (SVS/EFVS) {{technologies}} {{have the potential}} to provide additional margins of safety for aircrew performance and enable operational improvements for low visibility operations in the terminal area environment. Simulation and flight tests were jointly sponsored by NASA's Aviation Safety Program, Vehicle Systems Safety Technology project and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to evaluate potential safety and operational benefits of SVS/EFVS technologies in low visibility Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) operations. The flight tests were conducted by a team of Honeywell, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and NASA personnel with the goal of obtaining pilot-in-the-loop test data for flight validation, verification, and demonstration of selected SVS/EFVS operational and system-level performance capabilities. Nine test flights were flown in Gulfstream's G 450 flight test aircraft outfitted with the SVS/EFVS technologies under low visibility instrument meteorological conditions. Evaluation pilots flew 108 approaches in low visibility weather conditions (600 feet to 3600 feet reported visibility) under different obscurants (mist, fog, drizzle fog, frozen fog) and sky cover (broken, overcast). Flight test videos were evaluated at three different altitudes (<b>decision</b> <b>altitude,</b> 100 feet radar altitude, and touchdown) to determine the visual advantage afforded to the pilot using the EFVS/Forward-Looking InfraRed (FLIR) imagery compared to natural vision. Results indicate the EFVS provided a visual advantage of two to three times over that of the out-the-window (OTW) view. The EFVS allowed pilots to view the runway environment, specifically runway lights, before {{they would be able to}} OTW with natural vision...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{recently}} released new flight rule by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{a dream of}} imaging technology enthusiasts becomes reality: Visual guidance (VFR) of landing aircraft in adverse weather is no longer restricted by {{the performance of the}} human eye (measured as runway visual range, RVR). Based on the output of imaging sensors it is now allowed to continue the approach beyond the classical minimum <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> (MDA) or decision height (DH) down to about 100 ft whenever at DH or MDA the runway can be clearly identified within the sensor image. This rule change in aircraft operation will allow to conduct bad weather landings to non-ILS- equipped airfields and without an expensive on-board ILS installation. However, after this “quantum leap in flight rule making” new questions are coming up: “How to inform the pilot what the imaging sensor just sees?” Usually, a (quite expensive) Head Up Display (HUD) is required to show the output of the sensed image, which is presented in a raster scan overlay onto the existing stroke vector image. Is this “direct overlay method”, which “blocks” the transparency of the HUD, really {{the best way to do}} this, or are there other options to make-up enhanced visual aircraft guidance concepts and systems? The following contribution tries to give some hints for answering these questions and proposes a more transparent EVS display format. A new method for extracting the aircraft position relative to the runway in real-time from the on-board imaging sources is presented. Finally, some experimental results from flight trials during the US-American SE-Vision project, where the described method has been implemented and tested, are explained...|$|E
40|$|Using a new {{implementation}} of a NASA flight simulation of the Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft, autopilots were designed {{to be capable of}} flying both straight in (ILS) approaches, and circling (SNI) approaches. A standard glideslope coupler was sufficient for most conditions, but a standard Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) based localizer tracker was not sufficient for maintaining a lateral track on the SNI course. To track the SNI course, a feed-forward system, using GPS steering provided much better results. NASA and the FAA embrace the concept of a Simultaneous, Non-Interfering (SNI) approach as a way to increase airport throughput while reducing the noise footprints of aircraft on approach. The NASA concept for the SNI approach for Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) aircraft involves a straight in segment flown above the flight path of a normal approach, followed by a spiraling descent to the runway. As this is a procedure that would be utilized by regional airliners, it is assumed that it would be conducted under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). GPS or INS guidance would be required to fly this approach, and it is likely that it would be necessary to fly the approach with a coupled autopilot: a stabilized, curving, instrument approach to <b>decision</b> <b>altitude</b> would be exceedingly difficult to fly. The autopilots in many current commuter and general aviation aircraft, however, were designed before the event of GPS, and do not have provisions for tracking curved paths. This study identifies problem areas in implementing the SNI circling approach on aircraft and avionics as they stand today and also gives examples of what can be done for the SNI approach to be successful...|$|E
40|$|Enhanced Vision (EV) and {{synthetic}} vision (SV) systems {{may serve as}} enabling technologies {{to meet the challenges}} of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) Equivalent Visual Operations (EVO) concept ? that is, the ability to achieve or even improve on the safety of Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations, maintain the operational tempos of VFR, and even, perhaps, retain VFR procedures independent of actual weather and visibility conditions. One significant challenge lies in the definition of required equipage on the aircraft and on the airport to enable the EVO concept objective. A piloted simulation experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of the presence or absence of Synthetic Vision, the location of this information during an instrument approach (i. e., on a Head-Up or Head-Down Primary Flight Display), and the type of airport lighting information on landing minima. The quantitative data from this experiment were analyzed to begin the definition of performance-based criteria for all-weather approach and landing operations. Objective results from the present study showed that better approach performance was attainable with the head-up display (HUD) compared to the head-down display (HDD). A slight performance improvement in HDD performance was shown when SV was added, as the pilots descended below 200 ft to a 100 ft <b>decision</b> <b>altitude,</b> but this performance was not tested for statistical significance (nor was it expected to be statistically significant). The touchdown data showed that regardless of the display concept flown (SV HUD, Baseline HUD, SV HDD, Baseline HDD) a majority of the runs were within the performance-based defined approach and landing criteria in all the visibility levels, approach lighting systems, and decision altitudes tested. For this visual flight maneuver, RVR appeared to be the most significant influence in touchdown performance. The approach lighting system clearly impacted the pilot's ability to descend to 100 ft height above touchdown based on existing Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 91. 175 using a 200 ft decision height, but did not appear to influence touchdown performance or approach path maintenanc...|$|E
