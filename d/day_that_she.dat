5|$|John's wishes come true, {{though he}} is unaware that the Green-Eyed One owes Elspeth, his hideous spellcasting sister, a wish of her own. In order to fulfill her ambitions, the Green-Eyed One {{transforms}} Elspeth into {{a beautiful young woman}} who can now marry John and become his queen, second and new wife, and Snow White's stepmother. The creature also provides Elspeth with a magical mirror that allows her to see others unseen and to deceive John. As years pass, Elspeth forms a good relationship with her new husband, John, and stepdaughter, Snow White (who now becomes a beautiful princess 16 years later). However, Elspeth is vain and keeps a room full of magical mirrors which assure her each <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is the fairest of them all whenever she asks.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 15, due to the {{frequency}} of performances at different venues (up to six venues per <b>day)</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had, her voice was affected due {{to the development of}} nodules on her vocal chords. Following the advice of the doctor, she took a year off and to keep herself occupied, she attended art lessons with her cousin. After a year, she started performing again despite the change in her vocal range, which lowered her voice by an octave (eight keys).|$|E

25|$|Miss Eirlys Edwards, a {{clerk in}} Newport Education Department (with no {{training}} or experience in matters of child welfare), testified on the second <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> visited Bank Farm on 20 December 1944, and observed that the boys were treated with little affection, and while Terence appeared to be well cared for, Dennis appeared ill and frightened; she asked Mrs Gough to call a doctor to examine him, which {{she said she would}} do. She had recommended to her superiors that the boys be removed and Mr W. J. Edmonds, Newport's Deputy Director of Education, confirmed that he had requested Shropshire Education Committee to do so, although the Goughs had not yet been informed of this decision.|$|E

25|$|Doherty {{was born}} Ekaterina Fyodorovna Kolyschkine (Екатерина Фёдоровна Колышкина) in Nizhny Novgorod, Russian Empire. Her parents, Fyodor and Emma Thomson Kolyschkine, {{belonged to the}} minor nobility and were devout members of the Russian Orthodox Church who had their child baptized in St. Petersburg on September 15, 1896. She was not baptized on the same <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was born because her mother was worried she might get a disease {{as she had been}} born on a train. Schooled abroad due to her father's job, she had an {{exposure}} to the Catholic Church in the form of her schooling in Alexandria (Egypt) where her father, an aristocrat, had been posted by the government. Her family returned to St. Petersburg in 1910, where she was enrolled in the prestigious Princess Obolensky Academy.

25|$|By December 18, Gacy was {{beginning}} to show visible signs of strain {{as a result of}} the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 civil suit against the Des Plaines police, demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to a Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the parka pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor. This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11: the presence of the receipt indicated that Gacy must have been in contact with Robert Piest after the youth had left the Nisson Pharmacy on December 11.|$|E
25|$|Tahiti left New Zealand on 10 July 1918 with 1,117 troops onboard and 100 crew members, {{bound for}} England. When {{she met the}} rest of her convoy at Freetown in Sierra Leone, reports of disease ashore led to a {{quarantine}} order for the ships. However, the ships were resupplied by local workers, and officers attended a conference onboard HMS Mantua, an armed merchant cruiser, which had experienced an influenza outbreak three weeks previously. The first soldiers suffering from Spanish influenza began reporting to the hospital on Tahiti on 26 August, the <b>day</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> left Freetown. By the time she arrived at Devonport on 10 September 68 men had died and a further nine died afterwards, an overall mortality rate of 68.9 persons per 1,000 population. It is estimated that more than 1,000 of those on board had been infected with the disease. A later enquiry found that mortality was worst in those over 40 years and that those over 25 had a higher mortality than those under 25. Mortality was also higher in those sleeping in bunk beds rather than in hammocks. The conclusion of the enquiry was that overcrowding and poor ventilation had contributed to the exceptionally high infection rate and death toll. It {{was one of the worst}} outbreaks worldwide for the 1918/19 pandemic in terms of both morbidity and mortality.|$|E

2500|$|Glanville {{fritillary}} females vary {{in their}} PGI, a glycolytic enzyme, genotype.

Heterozygote females are able to operate {{earlier in the day}} compared to all other genotypes. Further, females with a Pgi-f allele are able to begin oviposition earlier in the day and are also able to lay larger clutch sizes. The Pgi-f allele contributes to a higher metabolic rate and the ability for females {{to take advantage of the}} climate of the early day - both of which factors allow for increased clutch size.|$|E
