5|$|After {{receiving}} the post-field goal kickoff, the Florida State offense began another drive. After an incomplete pass {{and a short}} rush, Weatherford completed a 12-yard pass for a first down as time expired in the quarter. After 15minutes of play, the score was tied 33, but Drew Weatherford had begun driving Florida State offense <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} toss and {{receiving}} the ball, the Giants offense stalled {{and was forced}} to punt. From their own 20, the Colts drove the ball <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> with Alan Ameche finally scoring from the 1–yard line to give the championship to the Colts, 23–17.|$|E

5|$|Connecticut {{took over}} {{at their own}} 32-yard line and, after {{throwing}} only twopasses in the first threequarters, completed threepasses over 10yards apiece to move <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> On a 2nd-and-5 from the Buffalo 15-yard line, Tyler Lorenzen scored his second rushing touchdown of the game. UConn's lead was extended to 31–20 with less than fiveminutes left in the game.|$|E
5|$|UConn's {{turnover}} woes {{continued on}} their next possession when, on their second play from scrimmage after receiving Buffalo's kickoff, Tyler Lorenzen was sacked, {{causing him to}} fumble the ball. The Bulls recovered and drove <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> to the UConn 12-yard line where they were stopped. Principe kicked a 29-yard field goal giving Buffalo back the lead, at 13–10.|$|E
5|$|Because Clemson {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Georgia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Chris Tanner returned the kickoff to the Tech 29-yard line, and the Yellow Jackets began the first offensive drive of the half. Jones opened the drive with a 16-yard run, then the Yellow Jackets converted a fourth down to continue <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> Six plays after the fourth-down conversion, Tech quarterback Nesbitt ran {{into the end zone}} for a touchdown. The following extra point gave Tech a 23–13 lead with 9:12 remaining.|$|E

5|$|Buffalo {{received}} the ball off the kickoff {{on their own}} 28-yard line. Losing eightyards on their threeplays, Buffalo once again punted the ball to Connecticut. UConn drove to the Buffalo 25-yard line and attempted a 42-yard field goal; the kick by Dave Teggart was blocked. Buffalo got the ball back {{with less than a}} minute left in the quarter and completed twopasses, moving the ball 13yards <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> before the quarter expired. The score remained in Connecticut's favor, 24–20.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the National Anthem, three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte commanded the drivers to start their engines. Edwards maintained his pole position lead going into the first corner with Earnhardt, Jr. in second. On lap two, Tony Stewart passed Edwards around the outside to take the lead. Edwards, with assistance from Bayne, moved in front of Stewart going into turn three to reclaim the first position two laps later. On the fifth lap, Earnhardt moved into the lead and Ambrose moved into second place. Edwards temporarily moved back into first before Earnhardt reclaimed the position. Bayne, who also battled for the lead, had moved <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> by lap seven. On lap nine, Michael McDowell made contact with David Gilliland's left-rear quarter panel between turns one and two; Gilliland went up the track towards the outside wall, and collected Menard and Montoya, triggering the first caution of the race and the appearance of the pace car. Keselowski was also caught up in the wreckage and his car sustained minor damage. Most of the drivers, including Earnhardt, made pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt was required to make an additional pit stop after one of his pit crew went over the wall too soon, dropping him <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E

5|$|Mississippi quarterback Archie Manning {{used the}} good field {{position}} and his inspired offense proficiently following the kick, driving the Rebels <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> and connecting with Hank Shows on a 21-yard touchdown pass for Mississippi's first points just 30 seconds {{into the second}} quarter. By halftime, Manning had connected on another touchdown pass, this one a 23-yard strike to Leon Felts. Tech still held a 1714 lead, but Mississippi had the momentum and would receive the ball to begin the second half.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, 2009, the Pittsburgh Steelers {{played the}} Detroit Lions at Ford Field. Nearing {{the end of}} the fourth quarter the Steelers were up by 8 points and the Lions were marching <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> At this time the Lions mascot Roary The Lion, stepped on, bit and ripped apart a Terrible Towel. Following this the Lions {{suffered}} three straight sacks to put them in a long fourth and twenty-eight situation. The Lions did not convert and the Steelers won the game 28-20.|$|E
5|$|Penn State {{received}} the opening kickoff, however {{on their first}} play from scrimmage, Bill Belton lost a fumble and Minnesota recovered and kicked a field goal after failing to achieve a first down. Penn State's punt on the subsequent drive was downed at the four-yard line, but the poor field position did not adversely affect Minnesota, who drove <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> for a 15-play, 96-yard drive, highlighted by a 24-yard pass from Philip Nelson to Maxx Williams to convert a fourth down {{to get down to}} the Penn State four-yard line, from which point they scored two plays later via a 1-yard run by David Cobb. Penn State responded, however, with Zach Zwinak rushing the ball 5 times for 61 yards including a 38-yard run, and ultimately a 6-yard touchdown scamper. At the end of the first quarter, Minnesota led 10–7. In the second quarter, Minnesota wasted no time, embarking on a 13-play, 70-yard drive that lasted 6:54 and ended with Nelson rushing for a 6-yard touchdown. Penn State responded, driving <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> on 13 plays for 65 yards lasting 5:57, culminating with Ficken kicking a 27-yard field goal after the drive stalled in the red zone. Late in the half, Minnesota drove <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> and Nelson completed a 24-yard touchdown pass to Williams, putting Minnesota on top 24–10 at the half. Receiving the second half kickoff, Minnesota initiated a drive that included a 39-yard run by Cobb, but ultimately ended in their first punt of the day, which they downed inside the one-yard line. Penn State achieved two first downs, but an illegal block in the back on Jesse James decimated the drive, which ended with a punt, but they caught a break a play later when Minnesota fumbled and Malcolm Willis recovered in Minnesota territory. The break did not materialize with any points, but their subsequent punt was downed inside the five yard line. Dreadful field position continued when, after driving for several yards, Minnesota's punt settled inside the five yard line, again setting Penn State up with a long field. In the waning moments of the third quarter, Penn State relied on Zwinak, who rushed several consecutive times to garner Penn State breathing room. There was no scoring in the third quarter. Penn State failed to convert a third down (they had still not converted any in the game), but Minnesota committed a roughing the kicker penalty, giving Penn State a second chance with which they converted their first third down of the game, but ultimately turned the ball over on downs. After a Minnesota punt, Penn State, for the first drive of the game, relied on their passing game to drive <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> but, when faced with a fourth down and ten deep in Minnesota territory, failed to convert. On Minnesota's ensuing possession, however, they managed to run only 47 seconds off the clock, and went three-and-out. Hoping not to again blow an opportunity, Penn State moved promptly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> and got into the red zone. While there, a pass to Allen Robinson resulted in a pass interference penalty called against Minnesota, giving Penn State the ball at the two-yard line, from where they fumbled, and Minnesota recovered, and embarked on a possession from which they would not relinquish the ball, winning the game 24–10, after no scoring in the second half.|$|E

5|$|SMU {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the game and marched <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> on an 8-play, 52-yard drive highlighted by a 37-yard run by quarterback Garrett Gilbert {{to set up a}} 41-yard field goal attempt by Chase Hover which he missed. Fresno State's subsequent drive lasted only two series and ended in a punt. The remainder of the first quarter's drives ended in punts. There were a total of three drives that went three-and-out in the quarter, two by SMU and one by Fresno State.|$|E
5|$|The Broncos' {{first drive}} {{of the second}} quarter was halted after a holding penalty and an {{incomplete}} pass denied BSU {{a chance for a}} first down. Boise was forced to kick the ball away once more. The Pirates' second drive of the quarter began at their 26–yard line. ECU needed just four plays to march 74yards <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> for a touchdown. On the drive, Chris Johnson rushed for 46yards and threw an 18–yard pass for a touchdown. After the touchdown and the extra point kick, ECU led 24–7.|$|E
5|$|The {{fourth quarter}} began with Stanford in {{possession}} of the ball and facing second down and three from its 39-yard line. Two plays gained the Cardinal a first down, then Stanford committed a false-start penalty that pushed its offense back fiveyards. Two plays later, however, Luck completed a 58-yard pass to Fleener, who made up the lost yardage and far more as he raced <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> for a touchdown. The following extra point granted Stanford a 33–12 lead with 12:28 remaining.|$|E

5|$|Warner {{had both}} halfbacks {{close to the}} line and {{flanking}} the defensive tackles. That {{was the start of}} the double wingback offense, which enjoyed tremendous popularity until the T formation was modernized with the man in motion.

5|$|Because NC State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech received NC State's kickoff and returned it to the 10-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Tech began working <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> running the ball for short gains and throwing passes for longer gains. Tech picked up three first downs, then reached NC State territory on a pass to Donnelly. Once on the NC State side of the field, Tech picked up another first down, but Tech's quarterback was sacked on third down for a loss, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away. The ball landed at the NC State 12-yard line where the Wolfpack began a drive.|$|E
