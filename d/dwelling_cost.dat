This hypothesis allows development of a hedonic price model that takes account of production adjustments. The model is applied to the Maryland Forest Conservation Act, which requires developers to retain or plant trees on part of the developed land. Being exempt from the Act allows developers to gain more for the subdivisions they develop: the cost to regulated developers is about six percent of the per-acre price of developed land. The Act has significantly lowered per-acre developed land values in subdivisions with a mixture of townhouses and single-family <b>dwellings.</b> <b>Costs</b> of the Act are reduced by provisions that allow developers to plant trees offsite or to pay fees in lieu of planting.

The site was approximately the midpoint of the railroad's mainline between Atlanta, GA and Washington, DC. As the shops were being built the Southern Railway developed a town, also named Spencer, alongside the shops for worker housing. Initially, the Southern partitioned 85 acres into 500 lots. Instead of creating a traditional [...] "company" [...] town in which the workers rented houses Southern sold the lots to workers or businesses for $100 apiece.

40|$|In his book, Capital in the 21 st Century,Thomas Piketty {{highlights}} {{the risk of}} an explosion of wealth inequality because capital is accumulating faster than income in several countries including the US and European countries such as France. Our work challenges the conclusions of the author in three steps. First, the author’s result {{is based on the}} rise of only one of the components of capital, namely housing capital,and due to housing prices. In fact, housing prices have risen faster than rent and income in many countries. It is worth noting that “productive” capital, excluding housing, has only risen weakly relative to income over the last few decades. Over the longer run, the “productive” capital/income ratio has not increased at all. Second, rent, not housing prices, should matter for the dynamics of wealth inequality, because rent represents both the actual income of housing capital for landlords and the <b>dwelling</b> <b>costs</b> saved by “owner-occupiers” (people living in their own houses). Logically, to properly measure capital, the value of housing capital must be corrected by measuring it on actual rental price, and not housing prices. Third, when we apply this change, we find that the capital/income ratio is actually stable or only mildly higher in the countries analyzed (France, the US, the UK, and Canada) except for Germany where it rose. These conclusions are exactly opposite to those found by Thomas Piketty. However, {{this does not mean that}} housing prices do not contribute to other forms of inequality. When housing prices rise, owners of the housing capital hold a higher value that can be transformed into consumption. It is also more difficult for young adults to become homeowners. Housing incomes of owners however do not necessarily increase which casts serious doubt on Piketty’s conclusion of a potential explosive dynamics of inequality based on these trends...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-Preventing and exterminating {{clinically}} relevant {{concentrations of}} house dust mite allergen {{in the urban}} environment {{is one of the}} more interesting challenges for architects and building engineers, pest control contractors, cleaning services, and sanitary biologists. When this challenge is not met, up to 40 % or more of the human population may be affected by allergic symptoms such as conjunctivitis, rhinitis, asthma or enema. The actual size of the problem in any given area depends on the massiveness and length of exposure to mite allergens arising from home textiles. Within Europe the sensitization rate for house dust mites ranges from 5 % to 25 % depending on the success of house dust mites (Pyroglyphidae) in <b>dwellings.</b> Yearly <b>cost</b> of allergy in the European Community amount to 9 milliard ECU, half of which is preventable by adequate avoidance measures.

40|$|Improved energy {{efficiency}} in new residential buildings is typically being sought across {{the developed world}} through changing requirements in building and/or planning regulations. Stringency is set to further increase significantly in attempts to meet climate change mitigation goals. However, new regulation is usually met with reticence from sectors of the building industry, one reason being the additional costs implied in meeting higher performance standards for more energy efficient buildings. One low cost option, investigated in this paper, is to orient buildings in order to maximise their passive solar benefits. Using a range of 81 different detached dwelling designs, a modelling experiment was conducted {{in order to assess}} the implications of orientation on modelled thermal {{energy efficiency}}. Design adaptability to orientation change was modelled across two scenarios; current building energy efficiency standards and pending improved energy efficiency standards. The effect of size and overall energy efficiency rating was included in consideration of variance across orientations. Results show that higher standards are easier to apply to smaller <b>dwellings,</b> and <b>costs</b> are lower. Also, higher performing designs are more flexible across different orientations, producing lower standard deviations of mean ratings.

Through in-depth interviews with homeowners living in danwei communities, or urban villages, at the pre-demolition phase, this paper reveals the strong connection between place attachment and {{both positive and}} negative lived experiences. The homeowners cleverly mobilise stable neighbourhood features and the challenges brought by neighbourhood changes to relieve their life constrains, such as the form of <b>dwellings,</b> low living <b>costs</b> and the place identity, which contributes to the development of place attachment. However, various forms of neighbourhood decline have negative effects on their place attachment. Urban redevelopment, therefore, confronts residents with a dilemma concerning the relative importance of their sense of rootedness in the neighbourhood and the desire to relocate to achieve better living conditions. By exploring this ambivalence, this paper displays how neighbourhood decline, and the impending demolition, affect residents' lived experiences and how residents in turn reconstruct their place attachment...|$|R

Materials and methods: Data linkage was used to examine retrospectively the service records of older individuals who had received a reablement service versus a conventional home care service to ascertain their use of home care services over time. Results: Individuals who had received a reablement service were less likely to use a personal care service throughout the follow-up period or any other type of home care over the next 3 years. This reduced use of home care services was associated with median cost savings per person of approximately AU $ 12, 500 over nearly 5 years. Conclusion: The inclusion of reablement as the starting point for individuals referred for home care within Australia&# 39;s reformed aged care system could increase the system&# 39;s cost effectiveness and ensure that all older Australians have the opportunity to maximize their independence as they age.

The design and costs of constructing or repairing residential footings is greatly influenced by the degree of ground movement, which {{is driven by the}} magnitude of change in soil moisture. The impacts {{of climate change}} on urban infrastructure are expected to include accelerated degradation of materials and foundations of buildings and facilities, increased ground movement, changes in ground water affecting the chemical structure of foundations, and fatigue of structures from extreme storm events. Previous research found that residential houses that were built less than five years ago have suffered major cracks and other damage caused by slab movement after record rainfall. The Thornthwaite Moisture Index (TMI) categorises climate on the basis of rainfall, temperature, potential evapotranspiration and the water holding capacity of the soil. Originally TMI was mainly used to map soil moisture conditions for agriculture but soon became a method to predict pavement and foundation changes. Few researchers have developed TMI maps for Australia, but generally, their accuracy is low or unknown, and their use is limited.

40|$|Background: An {{estimated}} 18 {{million people}} in the world have to cope with a decline in intellectual functioning that is not a normal part of the ageing process, called dementia. By 2025, this number is expected to reach 34 million. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 50 - 70 % of all cases of dementia. In the Netherlands, about two thirds of those affected live at home, with or without a partner. The increasing group of older adults with dementia presents great challenges in terms of creating suitable living environments and appropriate housing. Extramural housing needs further development, as opposed to intramural housing, such as nursery homes. The new extramural housing forms account for and compensate decreasing vitality and overall health status through the use of ICT and other technologies to serve human well-being. This should facilitate both residents and alleviate the intensity of care given by voluntary and professional care givers. In order to create these optimal <b>dwellings</b> at <b>cost</b> effective prices, evidence-based introduction of architectural measures and technological applications is essential. Existing knowledge is best viewed as an effort to expand and stimulate thinking on the relationships between dementia and design; thus, knowledge is largely a collection of hypotheses amenable to, and requiring, implementation and validation. This PhD-project will research some of the design aspects and needs, relevant to the technological home environment for older adults with dementia.

In our data we identify six dimensions of energy vulnerability for the fuel poor, including the three commonly cited in the literature (quality of <b>dwelling</b> fabric, energy <b>costs</b> and supply issues, and stability of household income). Tenancy relations, social relations within the household and outside, and ill health also play a mediating role in households' ability to cope.

In analysing these challenges we find that the energy vulnerable have limited agency to reduce their own vulnerability. Further, current UK policy relating to fuel poverty does not take full account of these challenges. Any attempt to address energy vulnerability coherently in the future must engage with structural forces (policies, markets, and recognition) in order to increase household agency for change...|$|R

40|$|An {{estimated}} 20 % of South Africa's {{population is}} currently housed in low <b>cost</b> <b>dwellings.</b> These dwellings are extremely energy inefficient {{and it has}} been shown that these households spend almost 20 % of their disposable income on heating in winter. This situation is undesirable for both the home owners and ESKOM who must ensure an unusually high electricity demand especially on winter nights. Some of the people don't use electricity for heating but fire and this contributes to the high levels of pollution in these communities. By ensuring better energy efficiency in these houses the demand for electricity will decrease and the pollution levels will obviously decrease as well. The process that strive to reduce this electricity demand is called Residential Demand Side Management (RDSM) and is strongly supported by ESKOM. This dissertation investigated the international experience concerning RDSM and some of the possible steps that could be taken to establish an RDSM program in South Africa. It was discovered that the two most important steps relevant for South Africa would be to install ceilings in low <b>cost</b> <b>dwellings</b> and to install insulation in middle income and low-income households. Various computer simulations using QUICKcontrol, a thermal design software package, was done to assess the effect that these steps would have on energy usage. Before any decisive steps could be taken to install these products in houses, it was important to hear what the public thought of the low-cost ceiling concept. It was decided to conduct a Socio Economic study to estimate the public opinion and the response towards the low cost ceiling turned out to be extremely favorable. The participants supported the idea of a low cost ceiling but the access to the ceiling might still prove to be difficult. Through experience it was found that people often don't want to invest in a certain product if the only benefit is a slight monetary saving. It has become necessary to investigate other aspects concerning the ceiling and insulation that would encourage people to buy into the concept. This line of thinking led to the "Comfort" study. The finding that insulation will ensure that almost three times more people are satisfied with their indoor situation is quite significant. The improvement of the indoor aesthetics if a ceiling is installed in a low-income dwelling is also an important consideration when a decision has to be made to install the product. This type of information could persuade people to purchase these products to the benefit of themselves, ESKOM, the insulation manufacturer and the environment.

The meeting in Nairobi 2014, indicates increasing concern about the danger they represent as two (2) reports which were announced at the meeting of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEA). No less important is the report on "the tendency of the flow of materials and resource productivity in Latin America," published in the field of UNEP in collaboration with CSIRO. This indicates that at present, the region extracts a greater volume of NN RR per unit of GDP compared to 1970. It is necessary to reflect on the housing needs for the type of composition of groups within society. Because there is a marked lack of social <b>dwellings</b> average <b>cost</b> for the age group of middle-class working families whose income does not cover deficit share of credit in a housing plan or who are at social risk such as fragments that comprise Reference neighborhood project. In another sense we argue that it is not to move them or dismantling them, a decision that usually does not solve the problem with new buildings where they do not melt the desire to live. Although we believe settle part of the emerging situation requires the district has regulations that establish certain uniformity of intervention techniques necessary; what must not be neglected is the complexity of local problems requesting the active intervention of all stakeholders involved. From this research have been relieved different experiences according to the brief summary {{made on the basis of}} the broad spectrum of practices examined, it is that we can apply some of these recorded experiences with the contribution of the analysis of the E.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the act on the national pension index, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health is to commission {{an evaluation of the}} adequacy of basic social security every four years. An independent expert group is to be appointed for the task and to carry out the assessment autonomously. In April 2014, commissioned by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, the National Institute for Health and Welfare convened the second expert group for evaluation of the adequacy of basic social security, and to conduct the second evaluation of its kind. The second expert group decided to conduct the evaluation by applying the same basic solutions as the first evaluation group did but developed and intensified the evaluation in several aspects. The second evaluation examines the development of the adequacy of basic social security and the factors affecting it from 2011 to 2015. The model family calculations applied in the evaluation have been generated with the new SISU microsimulation model of Statistics Finland. As a rule, the disposable income of households depending on basic benefits (or on low wages) increased between 2011 and 2015, in relation to average wage-earners and in real terms, both before and after <b>dwelling</b> <b>costs.</b> However, during the same period, the real wages of an average-earning household remained essentially at the same level. Persons living alone in rental dwellings and receiving the basic benefits are calculatedly entitled to means-tested basic social assistance. Their income level is determined according to the level of basic means-tested social assistance, and amounts to 43 per cent of the income level of average earners living alone. As the level of guarantee pension is higher than the other benefits, the estimated entitlement to means-tested social assistance is not realised. The income level of single-dweller guarantee pension recipients is 48 per cent of the income level of average earners. In Finland, the income level guaranteed by basic social security is in line with the average level in Western Europe, both before and after housing costs. With the exception of pensioners, the income level of persons relying on basic social security is not adequate to cover reasonable minimum costs determined in reference budgets. In 2014, the income level of unemployed persons, students or sickness allowance recipients living alone in rental housing was enough to cover 71 per cent of reasonable minimum costs. The respective figure for guarantee pension recipients was 102 per cent. The income level of persons on basic social security has increased since 2011 compared with the reference budgets of reasonable minimum costs. Their income level proves to be inadequate when compared with the level deemed adequate by the general public. It amounted to 66 per cent of the monetary sum deemed adequate. The income level of persons on guarantee pension amounted to 85 per cent of the level that the Finnish general public regarded adequate for living. The total number of people living in households completely dependent on basic social security—basic benefits, housing allowances and means-tested social assistance—totalled 231, 000 or 4. 3 per cent of the Finnish population in 2013. The number has increased since 2011. The average duration of total dependence on basic security is four years on average. A total of 71 per cent of households on basic social security benefits are at risk of poverty (the respective percentage for the total population is 13), and 54 per cent report their income to be inadequate (respectively, 25 per cent of the total population). When monitoring the benefits administrated by the Finnish Social Insurance Institution (Kela), the majority, or 64 per cent, of basic benefit recipients are women. Meanwhile, 61 per cent of general housing allowance recipients living alone are men. Further, of all recipients of means-tested social assistance 53 per cent are men. Reforms in benefit and tax legislation during 2011 – 2015 have decreased the Gini coefficient used to measure the income gap by approximately 0. 8 percentage points, and the relative poverty risk by approximately 1. 4 percentage points. Due to legislative amendments, the share of unemployed persons in unemployment traps has increased. Furthermore, the participation tax rate has increased, both regarding the transition from unemployment to full-time work and from part-time to full-time work. 143 pp. Originally published as Perusturvan riittävyyden arviointiraportti 2011 – 2015.
