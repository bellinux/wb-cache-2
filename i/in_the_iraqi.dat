5|$|The Iraqi Army had between 350,000 and 500,000 {{soldiers}} in theater, organized into 51 divisions, including eight Republican Guard divisions. Republican Guard units normally received the newest equipment; for example, {{most of the}} estimated 1,000 T-72 tanks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army {{on the eve of}} the war were in Republican Guard divisions. The Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (KTO) also included nine heavy divisions, composed mostly of professional soldiers, but with weapons of a generally lesser grade than those issued to the Republican Guard.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{military}} action in Anbar Province occurred on 26 October 2008, {{when a group of}} Army Special Forces conducted a raid into Syria to kill Abu Ghadiya, the leader of a network of foreign fighters who were traveling through Syria. Anbar continued to play a large role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> insurgency. That same month AQI announced the formation of the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), an umbrella group led by Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, a cleric from Anbar. After both Al-Baghdadi and Al-Masri were killed in Tikrit in April 2010, the US believed the new leader of AQI/ISI was Abu Dua al-Badri, a former Emir of Rawa who was married to a woman from Fallujah.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July 1933, {{more than}} 600 Assyrians, led by Malik Yaqu, {{crossed the border}} into Syria in hope of {{receiving}} asylum from the French Mandate of Syria. They were, however, disarmed and refused asylum, and were subsequently given light arms and sent back to Iraq on 4 August. They then decided to surrender themselves to the Iraqi Army. While crossing the Tigris in the Assyrian village of Dirabun, a clash erupted between the Assyrians and an Iraqi Army brigade. Despite the advantage of heavy artillery, the Iraqis were driven back to their military base in Dirabun. The Assyrians, convinced that the army had targeted them deliberately, attacked an army barracks with little success. They were driven back to Syria upon the arrival of Iraqi aeroplanes. The Iraqi Army lost 33 soldiers during the fighting while the Assyrian irregulars took fewer casualties. Historians do not agree on who started the clashes at the border. The British Administrative Inspector for Mosul, Lieutenant Colonel R. R. Stafford, wrote that the Assyrians {{had no intention of}} clashing with the Iraqis, while the Iraqi historian Khaldun Husry (son of the prominent Arab nationalist Sati' al-Husri) claims that it was Yaqu's men who provoked the army at Dirabun. Husry supported the propaganda rumours, which circulated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> nationalist newspapers, of the Assyrians mutilating the bodies of the killed Iraqi soldiers. This further enraged the Iraqi public against the Assyrians.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army moved 4 brigades, {{including}} one of its two tank brigades from the 9th Division, and a special forces battalion to Basra.

2500|$|According to National Geographic {{researcher}} Bijal Trivedi, [...] "Even {{after several}} days of bombing <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> showed remarkable resilience. Many continued with their daily lives, working and shopping, as bombs continued to fall around them. According to some analysts, the military's attack was perhaps too precise. It did not trigger shock and awe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> and, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end, the city was only captured after close combat {{on the outskirts of}} Baghdad." ...|$|R
50|$|After the December 2005 {{elections}} in Iraq, Al-Sadr's party got 32 new seats giving him substantial political power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> divided <b>Iraqi</b> Parliament. <b>In</b> January 2006, he used these seats {{to swing the}} vote for prime minister to Ibrahim Al-Jaafari, giving Al-Sadr a legitimate stake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new <b>Iraqi</b> government and allying Al-Jaafari with the cleric.|$|R
5|$|The power {{contest between}} the allied Military Committee and the Regionalists against the National Command was fought out {{within the party}} {{structure}}. However, the Military Committee and the Regionalists managed to turn the party structure on its head. At the 2nd Regional Congress (held in March 1965), {{it was decided to}} endorse the principle that the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command would be the ex officio head of state, and the Regional Command acquired the power to appoint the prime minister, the cabinet, the chief of staff, and the top military commanders. This change curtailed the powers of the National Command, who thenceforth had very little say in Syrian internal affairs. In response, at the 8th National Congress (April 1965) Aflaq had originally planned to launch an attack on the Military Committee and the Regionalists, but was persuaded not to by fellow National Command members – most notably by a Lebanese member, Jibran Majdalani, and a Saudi member, Ali Ghannam – because it could lead to the removal of the party's civilian leadership, as had occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Regional Branch. Because of this decision, Aflaq was voted from office as Secretary General, to be succeeded by fellow National Command member Munif al-Razzaz. Razzaz was a Syrian-born Jordanian who was not rooted enough in party politics to solve the crisis, even if under his command several joint meetings of the National and Regional Commands took place. Not longer after Aflaq's loss of office, Hafiz, the Secretary of the Regional Command, changed his allegiance to support the National Command. While Hafiz was the de jure leader of Syria (he held the offices of Regional Command secretary, Chairman of the Presidential Council, prime minister and commander-in-chief), it was Jadid, the Assistant Secretary General of the Regional Command, who was the de facto leader of Syria.|$|E
