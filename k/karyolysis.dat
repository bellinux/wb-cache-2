50|$|An {{example of}} {{amitosis}} particularly {{suited to the}} formation of multiple differentiated nuclei in a reasonably short period of time has been shown to occur during the differentiation of fluid-enclosing hemispheres called domes from adherent Ishikawa endometrial monolayer cells during an approximately 20-hour period. (Fleming 1995; Fleming, 1999) Aggregates of nuclei from monolayer syncytia become enveloped in mitochondrial membranes, forming structures (mitonucleons) that become elevated as a result of vacuole formation during the initial 6 hours of differentiation (Fleming 1998; Fleming, 2015a). Over the next 4 or 5 hours, chromatin from these aggregated nuclei becomes increasingly pycnotic, eventually undergoing <b>karyolysis</b> and karyorrhexis in the now-elevated predome structures (Fleming, 2015b). In other systems such changes accompany apoptosis but not in the differentiating Ishikawa cells, where the processes appear to accompany changes in DNA essential for the newly created differentiated dome cells. Finally, the chromatin filaments emerging from these processes form a mass from which dozens of dome nuclei are amitotically generated (Fleming, 2015c)over a period of approximately 3 hours with the apparent involvement of nuclear envelope-limited sheets.|$|E

Finally, when nuclear structures can no longer be seen in the spleen, about 72 per cent. of the nuclein nitrogen, about 50 per cent. of the original insoluble phosphorus, and 70 per cent. of the original insoluble nitrogen, are still in the insoluble form (precipitable and coagulable by alcohol), while about two thirds of the phosphatid phosphorus remains in complex organic combinations...|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} cell death concept is reviewed, with {{special attention to the}} origin of the terms necrosis, coagulation necrosis, autolysis, physiological cell death, programmed cell death, chromatolysis (the first name of apoptosis in 1914), karyorhexis, <b>karyolysis,</b> and cell suicide, of which there are three forms: by lysosomes, by free radicals, and by a genetic mechanism (apoptosis). Some of the typical features of apoptosis are discussed, such as budding (as opposed to blebbing and zeiosis) and the inflammatory response. For cell death not by apoptosis the most satisfactory term is accidental cell death. Necrosis is commonly used but it is not appropriate, because it does not indicate a form of cell death but refers to changes secondary to cell death by any mechanism, including apoptosis. Abundant data are available on one form of accidental cell death, namely ischemic cell death, which can be considered an entity of its own, caused by failure of the ionic pumps of the plasma membrane. Because ischemic cell death (in known models) is accompanied by swelling, the name oncosis is proposed for this condition. The term oncosis (derived from onkos, meaning swelling) was proposed in 1910 by von Reckling-hausen precisely to mean cell death with swelling. Oncosis leads to necrosis with <b>karyolysis</b> and stands in contrast to apoptosis, which leads to necrosis with karyorhexis and cell shrinkage...|$|E

Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP 1) is one of latent proteins, and mayor EBV oncoprotein, with functions including virus growth, and to activate BamHI-Z Leftward Reading Frame 1 (BZLF 1) -EBV, which can inhibit p 53 to induce apoptotic resistance, metastasis, and immune modulation. The body will respond to the expansion of EBV infection with activation of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase- 1 (PARP 1). The objective of study is to observe the expression of BZLF 1 and determine PARP 1 regulation in nasopharyngeal tissues. NPC-T 2, NPC-T 3 and polyp tissues slides are from Ulin Hospital, Banjarmasin. To characterize the necrotic cells such as pyknosis, karyorrhexsis, and <b>karyolysis,</b> histological slides were stained by HE that the necrotic cells measured by using a BX- 53 microscope (Olympus) with CellSens Standard software. Tissues slides were stained by using immunofluorohistochemistry with EBV-BZLF 1 antibody-Mouse anti-EBV monoclonal antibody against Goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC and anti-PARP 1 antibody (MC- 10) against Goat anti-mouse IgG labeled Rhodamin. The expression intensities were measured by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Olympus).

This study was conductedto investigate histopathological lesions of kidney, liver and intestine of goldfish (Carassius auratus) andangelfish (Pterophyllum sp.) in some aquarium shops during a period between January-April 2010. Several histological alterations were observed in kidney which include glomerulonephritis, cell swelling ofepithelial cells, tubular epithelium necrosis, hyaline droplets and hyaline cast in renal tubules and tubulardilation. Liver showed vacuolar degeneration of hepatocytes, <b>karyolysis</b> and karyorrhexis and focal areasof necrosis, haemorrhagia and hepatitis. In intestine, atrophy of epithelial cells and enteritis on thelamina propria and submucosal layer were seen. It was concluded that unfavourable environmentalcontamination of aquarium may induced several histopathological alterations in the tissues of goldfishand angelfishes...|$|E
40|$|The histopathological {{effects of}} dichlorvos, an {{organophosphate}} pesticide, on the gill and liver tissues in Cirrhinus mrigala {{were determined by}} light microscopy. The fishes were exposed to sublethal concentrations (0. 91 and 1. 82 ppm) of dichlorvos for 10 days with parallel untreated control. No histopathological effects were observed in control group. Hyperplasia, desquamation, and necrosis of epithelial, epithelial lifting, oedema, lamellar fusion, collapsed secondary lamellae, curling of secondary lamellae and aneurism in the secondary lamellae were observed in gill tissues exposed to dichlorvos. Hepatic lesions in the liver tissues of fishes exposed to dichlorvos were characterized by cloudy swelling of hepatocytes, congestion, vacuolar degeneration, <b>karyolysis,</b> karyohexis, dilation of sinusoids and nuclear hypertrophy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{comparatively}} evaluate genomic damage (micronucleus) and cellular death (pyknosis, <b>karyolysis,</b> and karyorrhexis) in exfoliated oral mucosa cells from crack cocaine users by micronucleus test. A total of 30 crack cocaine users and 30 health controls (non-exposed individuals) were included in this setting. Individuals had epithelial cells from cheek mechanically exfoliated, placed in fixative, and dropped in clean slides, which were checked for the above nuclear phenotypes. the results pointed out significant statistical differences (p < 0. 05) of micronucleated oral mucosa cells from crack cocaine users. Exposure to crack cocaine caused an increase of other nuclear alterations closely related to cytotoxicity such as <b>karyolysis</b> in oral cells as well. in summary, these data indicate that crack cocaine is able to induce chromosomal breakage and cellular death in oral mucosa cells of users.

40|$|Owing to the {{influence}} of geno- and cytotoxicity on chemical carcinogenesis, studies have demonstrated that petroleum derivatives are able to induce genetic damage and cellular death with conflicting results so far. the aim {{of the present study was}} to comparatively evaluate DNA damage (micronucleus) and cellular death (pyknosis, <b>karyolysis</b> and karyorrhexis) in exfoliated oral mucosa cells from gas petrol attendants using two different anatomic buccal sites: cheek mucosa and lateral border of the tongue. A total of 23 gas petrol attendants and 23 health controls (non-exposed individuals) were included in this setting. Individuals had epithelial cells from cheek and lateral border of the tongue mechanically exfoliated, placed in fixative and dropped in clean slides which were checked for the above nuclear phenotypes. the results pointed out significant statistical differences (p< 0. 05) of micronucleated oral mucosa cells from gas petrol attendants for both oral sites evaluated. in the same way, petroleum derivate exposure was able to increase other nuclear alterations closely related to cytotoxicity such as karyorrhexis, pyknosis and <b>karyolysis,</b> being the most pronunciated effects as those found in the lateral border of the tongue. No interaction was observed between smoking and petroleum exposure. in summary, these data indicate that gas petrol attendants comprise a high risk group for DNA damage and cellular death. It seems that the lateral border of the tongue is a more sensitive site to geno- and cytotoxic insult induced by petroleum derivates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{comparatively}} evaluate DNA damage (micronucleus) and cellular death (pyknosis, <b>karyolysis,</b> and karyorrhexis) in exfoliated oral mucosa cells from smokers and non-smokers submitted to dental X-ray using two anatomic sites: buccal mucosa and lateral border of the tongue. A total of 15 heavy smokers and 17 non-smokers were submitted to panoramic dental radiography for orthodontic reasons. Individuals had epithelial cells from cheek and lateral border of the tongue mechanically exfoliated, placed in fixative, and dropped in clean slides which were checked for the above nuclear phenotypes. the results pointed out no significant statistically differences (p > 0. 05) of micronucleated oral mucosa cells before versus after X-ray exposure for both oral sites evaluated either to smokers or to non-smokers. X-ray exposure was able to increase other nuclear alterations closely related to cytotoxicity such as karrhyorexis, pyknosis, and <b>karyolysis</b> for two groups evaluated. Nevertheless, the most pronunciated effects were found to lateral border of the tongue of smokers. in summary, these data indicate that panoramic X-ray is able to induce cellular death in oral mucosa cells. It seems that lateral border of the tongue is more sensitive site to cytotoxic insult induced by ionizing radiation combined with continuous cigarette smoke exposure.
