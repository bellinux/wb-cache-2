25|$|We {{said this}} movie is a stylized movie, it’s not so {{different}} from the world of a musical. And there were a <b>few</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that contributed to that direction. One was the decision on Universal’s part, a crazy decision, to shoot the movie almost entirely in the studio under a tarpaulin. They built this gigantic tarpaulin, and the Battery and all these other places were built as real places. The Richlands. And just so you know, this is the early ’80s and you had stylized films—like New York, New York—that were all done on set and that idea was in the air. That idea of a totally artificial universe. The point is that we had in mind one sentence inspired by George Lucas: “in a galaxy long ago,” a futuristic past. That was in our heads…there’s the past and there’s the future, sort of.|$|E
2500|$|The {{phonology}} of Danish {{is similar}} to that of the other Scandinavian languages such as [...] Swedish and Norwegian, but it also has distinct features setting it apart from the phonologies of its most closely related languages. For example Danish has a suprasegmental feature known as stød which is a kind of laryngeal phonation that is used phonemically. It also exhibits extensive lenition of plosives, which is noticeably more common than in the neighboring languages. Because of that and a <b>few</b> <b>other</b> <b>things,</b> spoken Danish is rather hard to understand for Norwegians and Swedes, although they can easily read it.|$|E

25|$|The 1968 {{season was}} little better. Young talent Jacky Ickx won the wet 1968 French Grand Prix with his driving skills, but had <b>few</b> <b>other</b> successes. <b>Things</b> became more {{complicated}} {{during the season}} {{by the introduction of}} aerodynamic aids into F1, and their quick development. At the end of the season, the Scuderia Ferrari was only 4th in the Constructors' Championship, and there was also no success in sportscar racing as Ferrari did not take part at all in 1968. Manager Franco Lini quit, and so did Ickx, moving to Brabham. To provide for the future, during the summer of 1968, Ferrari worked out a deal to sell his road car business to Fiat for $11 million; the transaction took place in early 1969, leaving 50% of the business still under control of Ferrari himself.|$|R
