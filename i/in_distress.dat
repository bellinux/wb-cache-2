5|$|Bears {{produce a}} number of vocal and non-vocal sounds. Tongue-clicking, {{grunting}} or chuffing many be made in cordial situations, such as between mothers and cubs or courting couples, while moaning, huffing, sorting or blowing air is made when an individual is stressed. Barking is produced during times of alarm, excitement or to give away the animal's position. Warning sounds include jaw-clicking and lip-popping, while teeth-chatters, bellows, growls, roars and pulsing sounds are made in aggressive encounters. Cubs may squeal, bawl, bleat or scream when <b>in</b> <b>distress</b> and make motor-like humming when comfortable or nursing.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{responses}} to Liverpool's third goal {{were to make}} substitutions in the final quarter of the game. Liverpool defender Rob Jones was swapped for striker Ian Rush and Newcastle's Darren Peacock was changed for Steve Howey in order to tighten up the Newcastle defence. As the match looked likely to end in a draw, in stoppage time Rush and John Barnes began to play a series of one-twos towards the Newcastle end. Barnes passed the ball to Collymore in a space on the left flank; Collymore kicked it past Srníček to score his second goal of the game, which prompted jubilant scenes in the Liverpool Kop. In contrast, Keegan slumped over the advertising hoardings <b>in</b> <b>distress.</b>|$|E

On board, flight attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong contacted American Airlines, and provided information about the hijackers and injuries to passengers and crew.|$|E
5|$|Homosexuality {{addressed}} by television started much later than films. Local talk {{shows in the}} late 1950s first addressed homosexuality by inviting panels of experts (usually not gay themselves) to discuss the problems of gay men in society. Lesbianism was rarely included. The first time a lesbian was portrayed on network television was the NBC drama The Eleventh Hour in the early 1960s, in a teleplay about an actress who feels she is persecuted by her female director, and <b>in</b> <b>distress,</b> calls a psychiatrist who explains she is a latent lesbian who has deep-rooted guilt about her feelings for women. When she realizes this, however, {{she is able to}} pursue healthy heterosexual relationships.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Substance users being {{admitted}} to inpatient treatment experience {{a high level}} of mental <b>distress.</b> <b>In</b> this study we explored changes <b>in</b> mental <b>distress</b> during treatment. Methods Mental distress, as measured by the HSCL- 10, was registered at admission and at discharge among 164 substance users in inpatient treatment in Northern Norway. Predictors of reduction <b>in</b> mental <b>distress</b> were examined utilizing hierarchical regression analysis. Results We found a significant reduction <b>in</b> mental <b>distress</b> <b>in</b> the sample, but the number of patients scoring above cut-off on the HSCL- 10 at discharge was still much higher than in the general population. A more severe use of substances as measured by the AUDIT and the DUDIT, and being female, predicted a higher level of mental distress at admission to treatment as well as greater reduction <b>in</b> mental <b>distress</b> during treatment. Holding no education beyond 10 year compulsory school only predicted a reduction <b>in</b> mental <b>distress.</b> Conclusions The toxic and withdrawal effects of substances, level of education as well as gender, contributed to the differences in change <b>in</b> mental <b>distress</b> during treatment. Regression to the mean may in part explain some of the findings. </p...|$|R
