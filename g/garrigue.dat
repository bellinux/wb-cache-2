The young Andrić's {{literary}} interests varied greatly, ranging from the Greek and Latin Classics to the works of past and contemporary literary figures, including German and Austrian writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Heinrich Heine, Friedrich Nietzsche, Franz Kafka, Rainer Maria Rilke and Thomas Mann, French writers Michel de Montaigne, Blaise Pascal, Gustave Flaubert, Victor Hugo and Guy de Maupassant, and British writers Thomas Carlyle, Walter Scott and Joseph Conrad. Andrić also read the works of Miguel de Cervantes, Italian poet and philosopher Giacomo Leopardi, Russian writer Nikolay Chernyshevsky, Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen, the American writers Walt Whitman and Henry James, and Czechoslovak philosopher Tomáš <b>Garrigue</b> Masaryk. Andrić was especially fond of Polish literature, and later stated that it had greatly influenced him. He held several Serb writers in high esteem, particularly Karadžić, Njegoš, Kočić and Aleksa Šantić. Andrić also admired the Slovene poets Fran Levstik, Josip Murn and Oton Župančič, and translated some of their works. Kafka appears {{to have had a}} significant influence on Andrić's prose, and his philosophical outlook was informed strongly by the works of Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard. At one point in his youth, Andrić even took an interest in Chinese and Japanese literature, which he read as French- and German-language translations.|$|E

In 1909 he helped Hinko Hinković in Vienna in the defense during the fabricated trial against mostly prominent Croats and Serbs, members of the Serbo-Croatian Coalition (such as Frano Supilo and Svetozar Pribićević), and others, who were sentenced to more than 150 years and a number of death penalties.

Then in the 5th game Medina <b>Garrigues</b> broke at her second chance to lead 4-1. Medina <b>Garrigues</b> then served out the set after cancelling another 3 break points to win the set 6-2. However the second set was a total reversal as Dushevina broke the Medina <b>Garrigues</b> serve twice at the 4th and 6th game, and improved her 1st serve percentage in virtue did not face a single break point to win the set 6-1. The deciding set was a lot more competitive than the other two as they both held serve at the first 6 games up until the 7th game, when Dushevina broke to lead 4-3. When it was 5-4, Dushevina was serving for the match but got broken by Medina <b>Garrigues.</b> But it didn't rattle Dushevina as she won the next two games to win the match at her 2nd match point.|$|R

500|$|In {{addition}} to its numerous memorials and monuments which pay homage to famous Americans, Washington, D.C. is home to many artworks honoring foreign heroes. Examples in Dupont Circle include memorials honoring Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi of India, Tomáš <b>Garrigue</b> Masaryk of Czechoslovakia, and Lajos Kossuth of Hungary. [...] The idea of a U.S. monument honoring Shevchenko began with the American Shevchenko Society, founded in 1898. [...] Although the group's efforts never came to fruition, Ukrainian Americans continued to pursue the goal. [...] A turning point was when Professor Ivan Dubrovsky wrote an article in Svoboda titled [...] "In Favor of a Shevchenko Monument in Washington, D.C.", asking for support from the Shevchenko Scientific Society and Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (UCCA). [...] Thousands of Ukrainian Americans sent letters to members of Congress while Lev Dobriansky, a Ukrainian American economist and anti-communism activist, became a prominent advocate and lobbyist for erecting a monument honoring Shevchenko. [...] The activists eventually gained the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits of New York and Representative Alvin Morell Bentley of Michigan. [...] Javits said [...] "Taras Shevchenko was a bard of freedom...It is fitting that the statue of such a national hero, who taught the American ideals of patriotism and service to man, should stand {{in the capital of}} the U.S." [...] and Bentley stated, [...] "In erecting a statue of Taras Shevchenko in Washington the United States will give full expression to its understanding and appreciation of Taras Shevchenko and all that he means to the brave and noble Ukrainian people." ...|$|E
