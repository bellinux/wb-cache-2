5|$|Pure {{beryllium}} metal did {{not become}} readily available until 1957, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as beryllium chloride with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified magnesium. The price on the American market for vacuum-cast beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{weakened}} to {{a depression}} when it moved inland, Cindy's effects were still significant across the final {{portion of its}} track. The day after its landfall in southeastern Louisiana, Tropical Depression Cindy reached central Alabama. There its rainbands produced heavy rainfall and eight tornadoes. Damage was mostly limited to trees and powerlines, but an F1 tornado in Macon county injured one man, destroyed an auto-repair shop, and damaged several nearby cars. About 35,000 residences in Alabama and 7,000 in both Florida and Mississippi were left without power following the storm.|$|E

His arrival was expected and the Danish king Frederick III had already ordered every building outside the city walls burnt, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> housed {{a third of the}} population of the city. That same day the city gates were closed and would not open again for another 22 months. A Swedish fleet of 28 ships blocked the harbor, preventing resupply by sea. The siege had begun.|$|E
5|$|The Caton–Corning {{segment of}} the route was {{acquired}} {{by the state of}} New York in 1911 and designated as part of NY44 (now NY414) as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. It received its current designation in 1949 when NY414 was truncated to begin in Corning. The highway leading east from Caton to Big Flats was county-maintained from the 1930s through the 1970s, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been part of NY13 from the 1930 renumbering to the 1940s. The state of New York assumed maintenance of the highway by 1986, and the new state highway became an extension of NY225.|$|E
5|$|Anderson met Todd and Quantrill on September 24, 1864; {{although}} they had clashed in the past, they agreed to work together. Anderson suggested that they attack Fayette, Missouri, targeting the 9th Missouri Cavalry, which was based at the town. Quantrill disliked the idea because the town was fortified, but Anderson and Todd prevailed. Clad in Union uniforms, the guerrillas generated little suspicion {{as they approached the}} town, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> received warning of nearby guerrillas. However, a guerrilla fired his weapon before they reached the town, and the cavalry quickly withdrew into their fort while civilians hid. Anderson and Todd launched an unsuccessful attack against the fort, leading charge after futile charge without injury. The defeat resulted in the deaths of five guerrillas but only two Union soldiers, further maddening Anderson.|$|E

5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> {{lost its}} {{defensive}} role, {{it was one}} of the strongest fortresses in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland up until the Second Partition of Poland of April 21, 1793. when both Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle and the city were transferred to the sovereignty of the Russian Empire. On the same day, the castle's commandant gave up the key to the castle and swore allegiance to the empire in the city's cathedral. One hundred and one artillery cannons later saluted the commandant's decision inside the castle. During the French invasion of Russia of 1812, the Russian Imperial Army was stationed in the castle. In 1815, Konstantin Batyushkov, who later became a well-known poet and writer, was stationed as an officer in the castle. In 1846, poet Vladimir Raevsky was stationed in the castle, during which time he established a pro-Decembrist organization of progressively-minded army officers.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of a collision with Esteban Gutiérrez in the Australian Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso was ruled out of the event with broken ribs and a pneumothorax, and as a result was replaced with McLaren reserve driver Stoffel Vandoorne. Gutiérrez received a new chassis after his team found that his original chassis was too damaged to be repaired, mostly caused by the crane during the recovery process and not in the accident itself. Meanwhile, Ferrari were able to use the same engine in Kimi Räikkönen's car as they had done in Australia, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> caught fire following a failure of the turbo charger. Swift reactions by the team on the scene prevented damage to the combustion engine, with only the turbo changed for Bahrain. Alfonso Celis Jr. made his first appearance in a Formula One session during the first free practice for Force India.|$|E
5|$|The {{restrictions}} were also applied to television drama, documentary and discussion programmes. In December 1988 the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Tom King, ordered Channel 4 to cancel {{an episode of}} the US drama series Lou Grant that featured {{the story of a}} fictional IRA gunrunner, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> aired previously. Mother Ireland, a 1988 documentary about women and Irish nationalism that included an interview with Mairéad Farrell, subsequently shot dead during an SAS operation in Gibraltar, was also initially banned. When screened by Channel 4 during a season about censorship in April 1991, Farrell's words on republicanism were muted, with on-screen subtitles. On a later occasion the appearance of the political activist Bernadette Devlin McAliskey on an edition of the BBC's Nation discussing reasons for political violence was also censored when much of what she said was subtitled.|$|E

5|$|The {{transfer}} of 750 noncommissioned officers (NCOs) from the 1st Cavalry Division to the 24th and 25th Infantry Divisions, a move aimed at strengthening the infantry divisions combat missions in Korea, had weakened the 1st Cavalry Division. It {{had been stripped}} of practically every NCO except the first sergeants of companies and batteries in the division. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> received 1,450 replacements before it left Japan, 100 {{of them from the}} Eighth Army stockade, the division was understrength when it landed in Korea and, like the preceding divisions, it had only two battalions in its three regiments, two firing batteries in the artillery battalions, and one tank company with M24 light tanks.|$|E
5|$|Expensive and {{elaborate}} ornamentation {{was an important}} part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been simplified since the early 17th century. Such ornamentation was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the ornamentation of Kronan, but according to common practice it was most lavish on the transom, the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of Kronan shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus Møinichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions rampant holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of Vasa, a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A tapestry at Rosenborg Castle shows Kronan as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.|$|E
5|$|When AirTrain JFK {{was being}} planned, it was {{expected}} that 11,000 passengers per day would pay to ride the system between the airport and either Howard Beach or Jamaica, while 23,000 more daily passengers would use the AirTrain to travel between terminals. This would amount to about 4 million paid passengers and 8.4 million in-airport passengers per year. The system would cause a reduction of approximately 75,000 vehicle miles driven per day, as well as accommodate over 3,000 daily riders from Manhattan, according to the FEIS. During the first month of service, an average of 15,000 daily passengers rode either the paid or unpaid sections of the system, less than the 34,000 expected daily riders. This made it the second-busiest airport transportation system in the United States, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been open for only a month. Since then, ridership continued to rise. AirTrain JFK transported 1 million riders within its first six months.|$|E

5|$|For the 72nd Academy Awards, the Academy invited 75 {{countries}} to submit films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The submission deadline {{was set on}} November 1, 1999. Forty-seven countries submitted films to the Academy, surpassing the record set in 1994. The Asian nations of Bhutan, Nepal and Tajikistan submitted films {{for the first time}} ever. The nominations were announced on February 15, 2000, and the winner was revealed during the awards presentation held on March 26, 2000. Belgium's submission Rosetta was not nominated, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> received the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival the previous year. Nepal received its first and so far only nomination for Caravan, a film made in the Tibetan language, which is spoken in parts of Nepal, about the country's now disappearing salt-trade system. The four other nominated films came from France, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The latter received its nomination for Solomon and Gaenor, the first film made entirely in Welsh and Yiddish. Spain eventually won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film for Pedro Almodóvar's All About My Mother. It was the country's third win after Volver a Empezar (To Begin Again) in 1982 and Belle Époque in 1993. Almodóvar dedicated the award to the Spanish people and to Spain, and had to be dragged from the stage after an overlong speech in which he thanked numerous saints and relatives.|$|E
