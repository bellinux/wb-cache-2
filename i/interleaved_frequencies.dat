30|$|Not only {{synchronization}} {{for standard}} multicarrier techniques are considered, also several variants of the multicarrier technique are studied. Block <b>interleaved</b> <b>frequency</b> {{division multiple access}} (B-IFDMA) is {{a variation of the}} OFDMA technique. In IFDMA, compression and repetition are applied on the data and different users are assigned different chip sequences. Before modulating the chips on the carriers, chip interleaving is applied. Therefore, IFDMA can be regarded as unitary precoded OFDMA with interleaved subcarriers. On the other hand, IFDMA can also be seen as a variant on the CDMA technique with orthogonal signature sequences. Similarly as OFDMA, this IFDMA technique turns out to be very sensitive to carrier frequency offsets. To make the technique more robust to carrier frequency offsets, the data of a user is transmitted on blocks of subcarriers that are equidistantly distributed over the available bandwidth, resulting in B-IFDMA. The paper by Simon et al. investigates the sensitivity of two variants of the B-IFDMA system, that is, joint DFT B-IFDMA and added-signal B-IFDMA, to carrier frequency offsets.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} channel estimation for single-carrierfrequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) system {{using the}} techniques typically used for an orthogonal frequency domain multiplexing (OFDM) system. Two techniques of frequency domain multiplexed (FDM) pilot insertion using <b>interleaved</b> <b>frequency</b> domain multiple access (IFDMA) signal with a Chu sequence are considered. One called frequency domain superimposed pilot technique (FDSPT) scales data-carrying tones and then superimposes them with pilot tones. This technique preserves spectral efficiency {{at the expense}} of performance loss.

Our results show that both techniques increase peak to average power ratio (PAPR) although it is still lower than that of an OFDM system. The application of FDSPT is limited by the pilot overhead ratio, resulting from the removal of data frequencies for pilot frequencies. It is shown that channel estimation using conventional time domain multiplexed pilots and FET pilot tones produce the same BER, while the FDSPT requires about 1. 5 dB more power for the same performance.

These experiments involve the manipulation of photons in the frequency domain, using off-the-shelf telecommunication components such as electro-optic phase modulators and narrow-band frequency filters. In the first experiment, photon pairs entangled in frequency are created and separated. Each photon is then directed through an independent electro-optic phase modulator. Variation of the radio-frequency parameters of the modulation gives rise to a well-controlled Bessel-shape two-photon interference pattern in the frequency domain. This is efficiently measured with narrow-band frequency filters and superconducting single photon detectors. Experimental measurements exhibit high visibilities (over 99 percent both for net and raw visibilities) and allow the (theoretically proven) optimal violation of a Bell inequality for our setup (by more than 18 standard deviations).

One, called frequency domain superimposed pilot technique (FDSPT), superimposes pilot tones onto scaled or deleted data tones, which preserves spectral efficiency {{at the expense}} of a slight performance loss. The other, called frequency expanding technique (FET), multiplexes pilot tones by displacing data tones, which slightly reduces spectral efficiency. Using FDM pilots in SC systems facilitates flexible and efficient assignment of signals to available spectrum. We propose an iterative frequency domain decision-directed interference cancellation technique to reduce the intersymbol interference level of SC signals with FDSPT pilots (resulting from the suppression of data tones). Moreover, we propose a low complexity frequency domain iterative decisiondirected channel estimation (IDDCE) technique for SC systems using FDM pilots. Using IDDCE, the frame error rate (FER) performance for coded SC systems using FET and FDSPT pilots with interference cancellation is found to be about 0. 2 dB and about 0. 5 dB, respectively, away from the FER performance with known channel frequency response at FER= 10 − 2.
