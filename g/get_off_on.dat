25|$|From then on new {{replacement}} B-17s {{coming in from}} the States via India and Africa were barely able {{to keep pace with the}} losses. The airdromes were never safe from enemy attack and being without adequate antiaircraft defenses, planes that could not <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> a combat mission early enough to evade the expected raids were sent away from the airfields at the first alarm to spend the day cruising aimlessly up and down off the south coast of Java 100 miles west of Malang, putting hour after hour on the engines and increasing the frustration of the crews. On the morning of February 8 nine B-17s of the 7th Group took off on a mission against the airdrome at Kendari from which the Japanese were now launching most of their raids on Java. Almost immediately after taking off the formation was attacked by the Japanese. Three were shot down and the other six jettisoned their bombs and attempted to hide in the clouds. Only one of the nine planes dispatched that morning from Malang one that had returned early with engine trouble, came back undamaged. Nineteen men had been killed.|$|E

When Morgan's brother Michael (Chad Duell) forces Morgan {{to go back home}} to Port Charles, Kiki follows and moves in with Morgan and Michael. While they initially <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> the wrong foot, Kiki softens toward Michael when she learns why he is so protective of Morgan. Kiki is shocked when her mother Ava Jerome (Maura West) confesses that her father, Franco (Roger Howarth) is very much alive. In addition, Kiki is also shocked to learn that Ava is a member of powerful Jerome crime family that is challenging Michael and Morgan's father Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) for his territory. After they kiss, Michael and Kiki are led to believe they are cousins. Noticing the attraction, Morgan convinces Kiki to marry him in the summer of 2013 only for it to be revealed that Kiki is the biological daughter of Dr. Silas Clay (Michael Easton). To divert his new bride's attention, Morgan resorts to buying Kiki expensive gifts. The marriage quickly implodes when Kiki learns that Morgan knew about her paternity before they married and she files for an annulment. Despite {{the fact that she is}} now dating Michael, Kiki is furious to discover Morgan and Ava are having an affair.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} deals with {{subjects}} {{as diverse as}} [...] "isolated communities, old school teachers and Roman roads", but maintains a [...] "warped coherency". According to Rhys, Mwngs lyrics—which he considers to be some of his best—were written [...] "very simply" [...] and convey simple messages. The singer {{made an effort to}} be economical with his words, not communicating a lot of information with them. Rhys feels that the album is accessible to non-Welsh speakers, citing his own experience of listening to Nirvana: [...] "If I listen to a Nirvana record I don't understand most of their lyrics cos he's just screaming away, but I just understand the frustration and the passion in his voice. I think equally people can <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> this record by just hitting on the mood of the song, or connecting to the mood of the song." ...|$|E

[...] "God Send Death" [...] and [...] "Deviance" [...] take up the idea of killing people for pleasure. Both songs were written by Hanneman.

He later admitted {{he was trying to get}} into that person's mind; [...] "why do they <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> it?

500|$|Meteor {{arrived in}} Bridgetown, Barbados, on 19 December 1869, and met the {{training}} ship [...] The gunboat {{was unable to}} stay in Barbados, as unrest in Venezuela threatened German nationals in the country, and she was ordered there to protect them. She remained in the area until mid-March 1870; {{at the beginning of}} the month, she anchored off La Guaira with Niobe in an attempt to enforce German financial claims in the city. During the period she operated off Venezuela, Meteor left once for periodic repairs at Willemstad, Curacao. On 16 March, she departed Venezuelan waters, bound for Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where she was to meet Arcona. On the way, Meteor struck a coral reef off Gonâve Island, though she was able to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> her own power. After arriving in Port-au-Prince, Knorr learned that Arcona had gone to La Guaira, and he was to take his vessel there as well.

500|$|Zaillian {{discussed}} many of {{the themes}} in Larsson's Millennium series with Fincher, taking the pair deeper into the novel's darker subjects, such as the psychological dissimilarities between rapists and murderers. Fincher {{was familiar with the}} concept, from projects such as Seven (1995) and Zodiac (2007). Zaillian commented, [...] "A rapist, or at least our rapist, is about exercising his power over somebody. A serial killer is about destruction; they <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> destroying something. It's not about having power over something, it's about eliminating it. What thrills them is slightly different." [...] The duo wanted to expose the novels' pivotal themes, particularly misogyny. [...] "We were committed to the tack that this is a movie about violence against women about specific kinds of degradation, and you can't shy away from that. But {{at the same time you}} have to walk a razor thin line so that the audience can viscerally feel the need for revenge but also see the power of the ideas being expressed." [...] Instead of the typical three-act structure, they reluctantly chose a five-act structure, which Fincher pointed out is [...] "very similar to a lot of TV cop dramas." ...|$|E

[...] When asked if [...] "Make the World Move" [...] would be released as a single, Aguilera replied saying that she was not sure about what would be done with the song. In an interview with MTV News in November, Aguilera explained how she felt the song would be suited to Green as she felt a male vocal contribution was needed, saying: [...] "I got to collaborate with my good buddy Cee Lo... There was a part for a potential male vocal on the chorus, and I just heard immediately Cee Lo's voice on it, his signature Cee Lo, and it was fun collaborating with him and having him on my record and us joining forces together." ...|$|E

2500|$|The debut {{episode of}} EastEnders {{began with the}} {{discovery}} of elderly resident Reg Cox's dead body, following his murder by Nick. Holland and Smith wanted to introduce the series in a dramatic fashion, and believed the Reg Cox storyline to be a good starting point, allowing various members of the community to be involved with or comment on the circumstances of the old man's murder. Santer has explained that Nick was established as a [...] "kind of spitting, snarling beast right from the outset", {{with the end of the}} first episode seeing Nick granted EastEnders first drum roll ending as he punched through the glass door window of The Queen Victoria pub after a fight with Ali Osman. After a few weeks of the police investigation, prime suspect Nick left the Square, and in April it was reported that he had been arrested. After Nick's mother, Dot, was introduced to the cast in July, she informed the audience that Nick had managed to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>on</b> probation, and the following month, he returned to Albert Square. Upon his return, he broke into Harold Legg's surgery and came across Kathy Beale's medical records, discovering she had a child at 14 years old. Nick threatens to reveal this to Kathy's husband, Pete unless she gives him regular payments. Kathy soon tells Pete the truth, resulting in him giving Nick a beating in the middle of the street. Following this, Den warns Nick to leave the square for good, with the exception of visiting Dot occasionally, or he will face fatal consequences.|$|E
