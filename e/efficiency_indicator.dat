For example, many <b>efficiency</b> <b>indicators</b> relate to the material volume processed, but since the volume is very small in finishing operations, the material removal rarely is the best indicator. This paper discusses more appropriate <b>efficiency</b> <b>indicators</b> for finishing operations which are calculated as ratio of change in process performance or part quality divided by the needed resources.

40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{industrial}} enterprises {{are facing}} up to new challenges to well optimize their performances, with regards not only to conventional performances (e. g. reliability or productivity) but also to emerging ones as those related to sustainability issues. Indeed, sustainability indicators {{have to be considered}} now in the decision-making process of the plant to better control and maintain it to be consistent with Green Production requirements. In that way, indicators such as Energy Efficiency or Energy Consumption are promoted for the impact they have on these requirements in a Life Cycle Cost vision. Thus the core idea defended in this paper is addressing the necessary evolution of conventional maintenance decision-making process in industry for considering the energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>indicator.</b> To support the idea, the first objective is to define the concept of energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>indicator</b> which materializes the energy efficiency performance at a specific time. The definition is done for different abstraction levels such as component, function, system which are subjected to time-dependent degradation behaviors. So, the energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>indicator</b> concept is expressed as the amount of energy consumed per unit of useful output, which has {{to be seen as a}} sustainable performance measure of industrial system. Then a mathematical formulation is proposed to calculate energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>indicator</b> at any time of the performance by considering dependent factors (static and dynamic ones) impacting inputs and outputs of the system. The second objective is to propose a new concept named REEL (Remaining energy-efficient lifetime) for tracking the energy efficiency performance evolution. The REEL is defined by the time left before the system loses its energy efficiency property considered as a specific EEI value (EEI threshold) not to be exceeded. This specific value is technically and/or economically fixed in advance, given the current condition, past and future operation profiles. The REEL could be used as an appropriate indicator for maintenance decision-making process in a proactive vision. The third objective is to formalize a generic approach in the way assess the REEL value. The assessment requires to forecast the evolution of energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>indicator</b> (whatever the abstraction level is) by taking into account the static and dynamic factors. Finally, the feasibility and added value of our proposals are illustrated on a manufacturing platform named TELMA (TELeMAintenance) ...|$|E

The sample includes n[*]=[*] 1250 doctors (n[*]=[*] 249 chiefs of clinical units; n[*]=[*] 1001 physicians) working in six public hospitals located in the Emilia-Romagna Region in Italy. Survey instruments include a checklist and a research-made questionnaire which were used for data collection about doctors’ knowledge and application as well as perceived utility of clinical governance tools. The analysis was based on clinical units’ performance indicators which include patients’ mortality, extra-region active mobility rate, average hospital stay, bed occupancy, rotation and turnover rates, and the comparative performance index as <b>efficiency</b> <b>indicators.</b> Results: The clinical governance tools are known and applied differently in all the considered clinical units. Significant differences emerged between roles and organizational levels at which the medical leadership is carried out. The levels of knowledge and application of clinical governance practices are correlated with the clinical units’ <b>efficiency</b> <b>indicators</b> (bed occupancy rate, bed turnover interval, and extra-region mobility).
