40|$|South Africa intends {{implementing}} major {{reforms in}} the financing of healthcare. Free market reforms in private health insurance in the late 1980 s have been reversed by the new democratic government since 1994 with the re-introduction of open enrolment, community rating and minimum benefits. A system of national health insurance with income cross-subsidies, risk-adjusted payments and mandatory membership has been envisaged in policy papers since 1994. Subsequent work has seen {{the design of a}} Risk <b>Equalisation</b> <b>Fund</b> intended to operate between competing private health insurance funds. The paper outlines the South African health system and describes the risk equalisation formula that has been developed. The risk factors are age, gender, maternity events, numbers with certain chronic diseases and numbers with multiple chronic diseases. The Risk <b>Equalisation</b> <b>Fund</b> has been operating in shadow mode since 2005 with data being collected but no money changing hands. The South African experience of risk equalisation is of wider interest as it demonstrates an attempt to introduce more solidarity into a small but highly competitive private insurance market. The measures taken to combat over-reporting of chronic disease should be useful for countries or funders considering adding chronic disease to their risk equalisation formulae.

40|$|The Austrian Federal {{government}} is striving {{to achieve a}} balanced national budget for 2002. In terms of budgetary distribution, {{it is assumed that}} the Länder (Federal states) will deliver a surplus of 0. 75 percent of GDP, whereas the communities will arrive at a balanced budget. Accordingly, the Federal budget could then have a deficit margin of 0. 75 percent of GDP. The budget proposed for 2002 meets this stability target. Current economic prospects, however, will not help to achieve the objective of a balanced budget. The Federal government attempts to meet its budgetary goal by raising additional (tax) revenues and by instituting savings on the expenditure side. Compared to 2000, the one-time effects on the revenue side of the 2002 budget are markedly lower, {{while at the same time}} the overall tax ratio is rising. Apart from ATS 1 billion, all of the additional revenues from taxation, which are estimated at about ATS 28 billion, will flow into Federal budget. At the same time, the Länder have raised their consolidation contribution to the Federal budget from ATS 2. 29 billion (from 2001) to ATS 4. 29 billion. Federal expenditures show substantial shifts due to budget consolidation. Altogether, both personnel expenses and transfers in the 2002 budget follow the original targets. The preliminary result for 2000 indicates that objectives were met, so that a solid foundation was built for the budgets for 2001 and 2002. The 2002 budget makes it clear that Bundesimmobiliengesellschaft is now investing a substantial part of the funds for construction and buildings which were formerly invested directly under the Federal budget. As a consequence, construction investment is noticeably lower in the Federal budget (at € 197 million in 2002, it is posted at more than 40 percent below the 2000 figure), whereas expenditure on rents has risen by almost € 400 million between 2000 and 2002. Other expenditure items similarly illustrate that the Federal {{government is}} increasingly outsourcing works and services to third parties rather than rendering them directly. Transfer payments are mostly within the scope of social expenditure. More than half of these payments are made to cover old-age pensions. At ATS 177. 3 billion (€ 12. 9 billion) in 2002, they will be 8. 2 percent higher than in 2000. The greater part of this sum is used as Federal contribution to the statutory pension insurance scheme (including equalisation payments) and transfers to the <b>equalisation</b> <b>funds</b> held by the pension insurance institutions. Apart from covering old-age pensions, a substantial share of the transfer payments involves family subsidies. The new child-care benefit (payable as of 2002) will make for a considerable increase of this item. Taking into account the abolishing of the parental leave benefit, the new child-care benefit will call for another ATS 6. 4 billion (€ 0. 46 billion) by 2002. Two components on the expenditure side will make an important contribution to budget consolidation: interest on the national debt and transfer payments to other public bodies. Lower budget deficits will make for interest payments in 2002 at roughly the 2001 level. Payments to other territorial authorities and funds are budgeted at ATS 113. 4 billion in 2002 (compared to ATS 113. 2 billion in 2000), as a consequence of the Federal government's attempt to reduce its financing functions.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of health information systems in the private health sector from a legislative and operational perspective, highlighting the duality of the South African health care system, which is also reflected in the health information system. The chapter explores data sources, data quality and collection processes as well as the minimum data set, which focuses primarily on access, utilisation, cost and quality of health care services. The role of health care providers, intermediaries such as data transmission companies, medical schemes and administrators in the flow of information in the private sector is also outlined. The Risk <b>Equalisation</b> <b>Fund</b> process highlights the implications of legislative reform on health information systems specifically, data requirements, data collection processes, and system requirements. Inherent in any health information system is the need to protect personal health information and this is dealt with in the context of confidentiality focusing on the adequacy of legislation, and processes and practices of different stakeholders with regards to personal health information. 9...|$|E
40|$|A {{progressive}} {{income tax}} penalises those taxpayers with a fluctuating income (for example, farmers), {{as compared with}} those on a stable income with the same average. However there are various methods of smoothing taxable income and hence reducing average tax payments. One such scheme is the Income Equalisation Scheme which was proposed by the Taxation Working Party of the Agricultural Development Conference in 1965 and was subsequently adopted by the Government. Under this scheme a farmer can deposit up to a quarter of his income from one year in the Income <b>Equalisation</b> <b>Fund.</b> He must withdraw a deposit within five years, adding the withdrawal to his income for that year. However, using the Income Equalisation Scheme has an opportunity cost, an opportunity foregone elsewhere. The funds deposited with the Government earn no interest. A thousand dollars deposited in the Fund for a year could have reduced a farmer’s overdraft with his bank by that amount, saving him about $ 75, In deciding how best to use the Income Equalisation Scheme to smooth taxable incomes, the tax saving gain from a smoother income must be balanced against the opportunity cost of storing the income in the <b>Equalisation</b> <b>Fund.</b> This paper describes a method for farmers and their advisers for making optimal use of the Income Equalisation Scheme. Optimal {{is defined as the}} maximisation of the present value of post-tax incomes. However readers should be aware that the scheme is of little value in reducing tax payments unless the farmer’s income is highly variable. In presenting the method which involves dynamic programming, the mathematics has been put in appendices so that the paper can be followed by those not skilled in mathematical techniques. The paper is divided into four sections. Firstly, a method of estimating farm income variability is given. Secondly, a method is presented for estimating the extra tax paid because of a fluctuating income. Thirdly, the results of using the Income Equalisation Scheme on historical incomes from Lincoln College's Ashley Dene farm are discussed. Finally, the rules for making optimal use of the Income Equalisation Scheme under realistic circumstances are presented...|$|E
40|$|By Hansjörg Blöchliger and Claire Charbit Fiscal {{equalisation}} is {{a transfer}} of fiscal resources across jurisdictions to offset disparities in revenue raising capacity or public service cost. It covers on average 2. 5 % of GDP or 5 % of total government expenditure across OECD countries. Equalisation reduces fiscal disparities by two-thirds on average and in some countries levels them virtually out. Strong equalisation comes at a price: on average, around 70 % of a jurisdiction’s additional tax income must be dedicated to an <b>equalisation</b> <b>fund.</b> The equalisation rate is generally higher for jurisdictions with low fiscal capacity, reducing their tax effort and likely to slow down regional economic convergence. Cost equalisation is larger than revenue equalisation in terms of GDP despite smaller cost disparities, pointing at inefficiencies in the distribution formulae. Fiscal equalisation can be pro-cyclical but most countries succeed in reducing fluctuations of entitlements, sometimes {{at the cost of}} sub-central budget needs. Fiscal equalisation is very country specific, and data and analysis must be taken with care. ...|$|E
40|$|In May 2007, the Premier of New South Wales (NSW) {{announced}} {{the establishment of}} an Inquiry into Electricity Supply in that State to be undertaken by the author of this paper. Fundamental to the Inquiry was the perceived need for additional baseload generating capacity, the identification of the available technologies, carbon constraints and the policy options that would encourage the private sector to undertake the required investments. Although NSW is part of the competitive National Electricity Market, State-owned generators dominate baseload supply. In addition, the State operates three electricity retailing businesses, has a monopoly on transmission and distribution, and provides price stability for NSW residential consumers through the Electricity Tariff <b>Equalisation</b> <b>Fund.</b> Overall, therefore, the State dominates the industry and, not surprisingly, potential private investors are sceptical that its market roles may be based upon criteria other than the purely commercial. The Inquiry's report, which was publicly released in September 2007, recommended sale of all State assets in both electricity generation and retail. This paper provides a rationale for that recommendation. Electricity New South Wales Privatisation...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the impact of the}} Financial and Fiscal Commission's (FFC) new provincial financing dispensation on the allocation of police resources and on the deliv ery of police services at provincial level. Trends in the police budget since the late 1989 s are examined, and the existing provincial allocation of police resources is analysed, as well as the relationship between crime rates, socio-economic variables and the provincial allocation of police resources. A new framework for the provincial allocation of police resources is subsequently proposed. This framework is based on the FFC's proposed provincial grants formula and the establishment of a Crime <b>Equalisation</b> <b>Fund</b> (CEF) which allocates additional police resources based on each province's per capita crime rates and specific priority crimes. The article argues that the phased reallocation of po lice resources to provinces via this new framework will contribute to a more equitable and effective utilisation of existing police resources, which in turn should {{have a positive impact on}} the delivery of police services and the levels of crime. It also suggests that the further devolution of the police budget to provinces is likely to be inhibited by the ANC's commitment to retaining a national, centralised police service. Thus, any further devolu tion of budgetary powers with respect to policing will be determined by the outcome of centre-province political dynamics rather than by the need to combat crime more effec tively at provincial levels. ...|$|E
40|$|MBA - WBSSince 2003, petrol {{prices in}} South Africa have {{increased}} to unprecedented levels, {{due largely to}} global increases in crude oil prices. Although there are different opinions on the causes of high crude oil prices, there is consensus that high fuel prices {{have a negative impact}} on global economies, in general, and on developing economies in particular. The impact of high petrol prices on economic development has, in some countries, required that governments derive mechanisms of mitigating their impact. One way to lessen the impact of petrol price increases and volatility is through hedging at a national level. Up until 2003, the South African government used to manage petrol price increases for the petrol consumer through use of an <b>equalisation</b> <b>fund</b> mechanism. However, in 2004 the practice was discontinued and a number of attempts to find a replacement have had limited success. This study seeks to provide an ex post empirical analysis of the impact of hedging South Africa‟s petrol prices. The analysis shows the beneficial impact of the use of derivatives in reducing the consumer price risk. It examines the impact of the unhedged strategy against hedging petrol prices in order to evaluate the overall cost of petrol to the consumer that would result from hedging. The hedging strategy considered in this research involves purchasing artificial call options using a strategy that is known commonly as “writing reverse calls”. In the study, these options are priced through use of the Black-Scholes formula. The total cost of petrol to the consumer with the hedge is then compared against the situation where there is no hedge. The study found that the proposed hedging strategy could result in lower consumer prices and lower petrol price volatility. Lower prices also imply that the inflationary impact of fuel prices could be reduced...|$|E
