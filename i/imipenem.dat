25|$|Intensive-care {{patients}} {{at risk for}} pseudomonas aeruginosa: These patients require antibiotics targeting this difficult-to-eradicate bacterium. One regimen is an intravenous antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, <b>imipenem,</b> meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an IV antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin. Another is an IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, <b>imipenem,</b> meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin or tobramycin, plus a macrolide (such as azithromycin) or a nonpseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.|$|E

25|$|CcrA (CfiA). Its gene {{occurs in}} c. 1-3% of B. fragilis isolates, but fewer produce the enzyme since {{expression}} demands appropriate migration of an insertion sequence. CcrA was known before <b>imipenem</b> was introduced, and producers have shown little subsequent increase.|$|E
2500|$|Theoretical {{reasons are}} given for believing {{mortality}} might be lower in patients treated with imipenem: first, less endotoxin is released by dying bacteria during <b>imipenem</b> treatment, and the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) for <b>imipenem</b> is lower than for ceftazidime. However, no clinically relevant difference was found in mortality between <b>imipenem</b> and ceftazidime treatments. [...] The MIC of meropenem is higher for B.pseudomallei than for many other organisms, and patients being haemofiltered will need more frequent or higher doses.|$|E

2500|$|For infections {{caused by}} ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella species, {{treatment}} with <b>imipenem</b> or meropenem {{has been associated}} with the best outcomes in terms of survival and bacteriologic clearance. Cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam have been less successful. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime have failed even more often, despite the organism's susceptibility to the antibiotic in vitro. Several reports have documented failure of cephamycin therapy as a result of resistance due to porin loss. Some patients have responded to aminoglycoside or quinolone therapy, but, in a recent comparison of ciprofloxacin and <b>imipenem</b> for bacteremia involving an ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, <b>imipenem</b> produced the better outcome ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{randomized}} controlled trial with {{patients who had}} at least 50% pancreatic necrosis found a benefit from <b>imipenem</b> compared to pefloxacin with a reduction in infected necrosis from 34% to 20% ...|$|E
2500|$|Intravenous {{ceftazidime}} is {{the current}} drug of choice for treatment of acute melioidosis and should be administered 10 to 14 days after getting the infection. Meropenem, <b>imipenem</b> and the cefoperazone-sulbactam combination (Sulperazone) are also active. [...] Intravenous amoxicillin-clavulanate (co-amoxiclav) may be used if {{none of the above}} four drugs is available, but it produces inferior outcomes. Intravenous antibiotics are given for a minimum of 10 to 14 days, and are not usually stopped until the patient's temperature has returned to normal for more than 48 hours. Even with appropriate antibiotic therapy, fevers often persist for weeks or months, and patients may continue to develop new lesions even while on appropriate treatment. The median fever clearance time in melioidosis is 10 days: and failure of the fever to clear is not a reason to alter treatment. It is not uncommon for patients to require [...] treatment continuously for a month or more.|$|E
50|$|<b>Imipenem</b> {{inhibits}} bacterial cell-wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins; cilastatin prevents renal metabolism of <b>imipenem.</b>|$|E

50|$|Acinetobacter anitratus, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacteroides distasonis, Bacteroides uniformis, and Clostridium {{perfringens}} {{are generally}} susceptible to <b>imipenem,</b> while Acinetobacter baumannii, some Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides fragilis, and Enterococcus faecalis have developed resistance to <b>imipenem</b> to varying degrees. Not many species {{are resistant to}} <b>imipenem</b> except Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Oman) and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Imipenem,</b> {{the first}} {{clinically}} used carbapenem, was developed at Merck and Co. It was approved {{for use in}} the United States in 1985. [...] <b>Imipenem</b> is hydrolyzed in the mammalian kidney by a dehydropeptidase enzyme to a nephrotoxic intermediate, and thus is co-formulated with the dehydropeptidase inhibitor cilastatin. [...] <b>Imipenem</b> is available in both intravenous and intramuscular formulations.|$|E
50|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} are nausea and vomiting. People who are allergic to penicillin and other Î²-lactam antibiotics should take caution if taking <b>imipenem,</b> as cross-reactivity rates are low. At high doses, <b>imipenem</b> is seizurogenic.|$|E
50|$|Meropenem {{is stable}} to {{mammalian}} dehydropeptidases {{and does not}} require co-administration of cilastatin. It was approved {{for use in the}} United States in 1996. In most indications it is somewhat more convenient to administer than <b>imipenem,</b> 3 times a day rather than 4. Doses of less than one gram may be administered as an IV bolus, whereas <b>imipenem</b> is usually administered as a 20-minute to one hour infusion. Meropenem is somewhat less potent than <b>imipenem</b> against gram-positive pathogens, and somewhat more potent against gram-negative infections. Unlike <b>imipenem,</b> which produced an unacceptable rate of seizures in a phase 2 trial, meropenem is effective for the treatment of bacterial meningitis. A systematic review performed by an employee of the company that markets meropenem concluded that it provides a higher bacterial response and lower adverse event rates than <b>imipenem</b> in people with severe infections, but no difference in mortality rate.|$|E

5000|$|Thienamycin is {{extremely}} unstable and decomposes in aqueous solution. Consequently, it is impractical for the clinical treatment of bacterial infections, so stable derivatives were created for medicinal consumption. One such derivative [...] - [...] <b>imipenem</b> [...] - [...] was formulated in 1985. <b>Imipenem,</b> an N-formimidoyl derivative of thienamycin, is rapidly metabolized by a renal dipeptidase enzyme {{found in the}} human body. To prevent its rapid degradation, <b>imipenem</b> is normally coadministered with cilastatin, an inhibitor of this enzyme.|$|E

50|$|Variations {{are seen}} in the media used for inoculation. Many studies use media with 1 to 2 mg/l of <b>imipenem.</b> However, {{bacteria}} that produce OXA-48 or OXA-181 result in low-level resistance, which cannot be detected efficiently due to the high concentration.Therefore, more recent screening media use broth containing 0.5-1 mg/l <b>imipenem</b> or 0.5 mg/l ertapenem.|$|E

50|$|The {{carbapenem}} ertapenem is one {{of several}} first-line agents recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America for the empiric treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to-moderate severity. Agents with anti-pseudomonal activity, including doripenem, <b>imipenem,</b> and meropenem are not recommended in this population. Doripenem, <b>imipenem,</b> and meropenem are recommended for high-risk community-acquired abdominal infections and for abdominal infections that are hospital-acquired.|$|E

50|$|Unlike <b>imipenem</b> and meropenem, {{ertapenem}} {{is highly}} protein-bound, {{which results in}} a longer half-life (4 hours).|$|E
5000|$|Cefoxitin is a {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic which binds penicillin binding proteins, or transpeptidases. By binding to PBPs, cefoxitin {{prevents the}} PBPs from forming the cross-linkages between the peptidoglycan layers {{that make up}} the bacterial cell wall, thereby interefering with cell wall synthesis. It is a strong beta-lactamase inducer, as are certain other antibiotics (such as <b>imipenem).</b> However, cefoxitin is a better substrate than <b>imipenem</b> for beta-lactamases.|$|E
50|$|The type strain {{isolates}} were susceptible {{in vitro}} to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, tobramycin, cefoxitin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole and <b>imipenem.</b>|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, {{diarrhea}}, and pain {{at the site}} of injection. Other side effects may include Clostridium difficile diarrhea and allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. <b>Imipenem</b> is in the carbapenem family of medications and works by interfering with the bacteria's cell wall. Cilastatin blocks the activity of dehydropeptidase I which prevents the breakdown of <b>imipenem.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Imipenem</b> was {{patented}} in 1975.

It is particularly important for its activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Enterococcus species. It is not active against MRSA, however.|$|E
