Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by sacrificing certain body parts: crabs can shed a claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.|$|E
5|$|Activated in 1921, the {{division}} was created as an infantry unit {{with a focus}} on nighttime combat operations.

5|$|Goodrich {{remained}} the favourite home of Richard Talbot's descendants for many years. During the early years, {{the security situation}} in Wales remained of concern.

In {{the early stages of the}} Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during the night. The publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF was <b>fighting</b> <b>back</b> and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was singled out for attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E

The fire could not penetrate the tanks' armor, but did damage their optics and prevented the tanks from <b>fighting</b> <b>back</b> effectively.|$|E
