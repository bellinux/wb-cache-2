5|$|Elvis Presley is {{a supreme}} figure in American life, one whose presence, {{no matter how}} banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.... The {{cultural}} range of his music has expanded {{to the point where}} it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.... Elvis has emerged as <b>a</b> <b>great</b> artist, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> rocker, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> purveyor of schlock, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> heart throb, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> bore, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> symbol of potency, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> ham, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> nice person, and, yes, <b>a</b> <b>great</b> American.|$|R

He dominated his era as he dominated conversations...the masses loved him; he {{proved to be}} <b>a</b> <b>great</b> popular idol and <b>a</b> <b>great</b> vote getter." [...] His image stands alongside George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln on Mount Rushmore. Although Roosevelt has been criticized by some for his perceived imperialist stance, he is often ranked by historians among the top-five greatest U.S. Presidents of all time.|$|R
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on {{opposition}} to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into {{institutions of higher}} learning argued that education was too <b>great</b> <b>a</b> physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus was so <b>great</b> <b>a</b> {{person by}} reason {{both of his}} {{excessive}} haughtiness and of his vast power, that, to put it briefly, he himself {{seemed to be the}} emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of Capreae.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, Darius {{sponsored}} large {{construction projects}} in Susa, Babylon, Egypt, and Persepolis. In Susa, Darius {{built a new}} palace complex {{in the north of}} the city. An inscription states that the palace was destroyed during the reign of Artaxerxes I, but was rebuilt. Today only glazed bricks of the palace remain, the majority of them in the Louvre. In Pasargadae Darius finished all incomplete construction projects from the reign of Cyrus the <b>Great.</b> <b>A</b> palace was also built during the reign of Darius, with an inscription in the name of Cyrus the Great. It was previously believed that Cyrus had constructed this building, however due to the cuneiform script being used, the palace {{is believed to have been}} constructed by Darius.|$|E

5|$|However, {{another major}} reason for rising costs was {{the need to develop}} a {{separate}} variant for the photo-reconnaissance mission when the underwing pods caused too <b>great</b> <b>a</b> performance penalty. The differences between the IIIS and the IIIRS (as the reconnaissance version was designated) resulted in only 36Mirage IIIS fighters and 18IIIRS reconnaissance aircraft actually built by the Federal Aircraft Factory at Emmen. Twelve were allocated to a reconnaissance squadron, three to a training group and the rest to two fighter squadrons. It was found that such a small number was insufficient to provide the multi-role capacity deemed essential for the new doctrine. The Mirage IIIS went into service in 1967, and the IIIRS in 1969.|$|E

5|$|On 29 May, Deutschland was {{attacked}} by two Republican planes. It was claimed that their Soviet pilots had mistaken it for the Nationalist ship Canarias, or else had been fired upon by it. 32 sailors were killed, the Kriegsmarine's greatest loss {{of life in the}} war. After a retaliatory attack on Almeria (Valencia had been the original target, but minefields posed too <b>great</b> <b>a</b> problem), Germany came close to withdrawing from the agreement, but British diplomatic efforts to keep Germany patrolling prevailed. After the Germans claimed that Leipzig had been attacked by an unidentified submarine off Oran, it formally withdrew from international patrols to enforce the agreement. Republican minister of defense Indalecio Prieto considered a declaration of war on Germany, but Soviet fear of a world war prevented this.|$|E

But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force. ... Elvis's breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely." [...] Not only Presley's achievements, but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons. ... The cultural range of his music has expanded {{to the point where it}} includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues. ...

5|$|That year saw Shostakovich again turn to {{the subject}} of anti-Semitism in his Thirteenth Symphony (subtitled Babi Yar). The symphony sets a number of poems by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the first of which commemorates a {{massacre}} of Ukrainian Jews during the Second World War. Opinions are divided how <b>great</b> <b>a</b> risk this was: the poem had been published in Soviet media, and was not banned, but it remained controversial. After the symphony's premiere, Yevtushenko was forced to add a stanza to his poem which said that Russians and Ukrainians had died alongside the Jews at Babi Yar.|$|E
5|$|The I-5 and the I-6 were {{virtually}} identical in performance, although the I-6 took 15 seconds {{to complete a}} full circle versus the 9.5 seconds of the I-5. Both aircraft were armed with two 7.62mm (0.3in) PV-1 machine guns, but the production model of the I-5 {{was expected to be}} armed with four, although this proved to impose too <b>great</b> <b>a</b> penalty to the I-5's performance. The exact reasons for the selection of the I-5 over the I-6, which was debated for a full year, are not known, but likely relate to both of these factors. Curiously, Polikarpov was not informed of the selection of the I-5 until his release in 1933 after his initial sentence of death had been commuted to ten years of imprisonment in a labor camp.|$|E

5|$|Because Hope was a {{work that}} was {{impossible}} to read using the traditional interpretation of symbolism in painting, Watts intentionally left its meaning ambiguous, and the bleaker interpretations were almost immediately challenged by Christian thinkers following its exhibition. Scottish theologian P. T. Forsyth felt that Hope was a companion to Watts's 1885 Mammon in depicting false gods and the perils awaiting those who attempted to follow them {{in the absence of}} faith. Forsyth wrote that the image conveyed the absence of faith, illustrated that a loss of faith placed too <b>great</b> <b>a</b> burden on hope alone, and that the message of the painting was that in the godless world created by technology, Hope has intentionally blinded herself and listens only to that music she can make on her own. Forsyth's interpretation, that the central figure is not herself a personification of hope but a representation of humanity too horrified at the world it has created to look at it, instead deliberately blinding itself and living in hope, became popular with other theologians.|$|E
5|$|Betty visits Bruce in the {{hospital}} and remarks that he should be dead, but Bruce feels <b>great.</b> <b>A</b> new janitor at the lab claims that he is Bruce's biological father, of whom Bruce has no recollection. When under extreme stress, Bruce transforms into the Hulk, a huge, humanoid, green-skinned monstrous being who destroys the laboratory, though Bruce later has no memory of the incident. General Ross suspects Bruce of collaborating with David Banner but deduces Bruce has repressed memories. He orders Bruce to be put under house arrest. Through a phone call with his father, Bruce learns that the radiation unleashed something that was already in his DNA, and that David Banner plans to have Betty killed by his dogs, which now have similar powers to the Hulk thanks to David mutating them with gamma radiation. Bruce is then attacked by Major Glenn Talbot, leading to a transformation into the Hulk. The Hulk seriously injures Talbot before leaping to save Betty. After being wounded in a lengthy struggle, he kills David's dogs and changes back into Bruce before being captured by the military the next morning.|$|E
