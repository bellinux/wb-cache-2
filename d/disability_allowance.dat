Ron Hubbard Jr, testified later that Hubbard was dependent on his own father and Margaret's parents for money and his writings, which he was paid at a penny per word, never garnered him any more than $10,000 prior to the founding of Scientology.

50|$|In New Zealand {{income support}} exists {{for people with}} {{physical}} or mental health issues. The two main disability benefits are the Sickness Benefit, and the Invalid's Benefit. A doctor's referral and medical certificate (or equivalent) is needed to claim the benefits. The Invalid's Benefit is {{for someone who has}} a severe disability, and/or long term sickness, which is paid slightly more than the Sickness Benefit.

All of these benefits have maximum limits, depending on such things as income (both the individual and their partner) and cash assets.
