5|$|According to the Board, Grissom {{suffered}} severe third degree {{burns on}} over one-third of <b>his</b> <b>body</b> and his spacesuit was mostly destroyed. White suffered third degree burns on {{almost half of}} <b>his</b> <b>body</b> and a quarter of his spacesuit had melted away. Chaffee suffered third degree burns over {{almost a quarter of}} <b>his</b> <b>body</b> and a small portion of his spacesuit was damaged. The autopsy report confirmed that the primary cause of death for all three astronauts was cardiac arrest caused by high concentrations of carbon monoxide. Burns suffered by the crew were not believed to be major factors, and it was concluded that most of them had occurred postmortem. Asphyxiation happened after the fire melted the astronauts' suits and oxygen tubes, exposing them to the lethal atmosphere of the cabin.|$|E
