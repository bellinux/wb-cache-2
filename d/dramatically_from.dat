5|$|During {{the great}} housing {{boom of the}} late 1930s, Giffnock began to grow rapidly. Between 1930 and 1940, as many as 3,000 {{dwellings}} were constructed, and the population rose <b>dramatically,</b> <b>from</b> 1,425 to 3,471 in 1939 and 9,144 in 1951.|$|E

The Renault team {{improved}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>from</b> first practice, with Giancarlo Fisichella second and Kovalainen third. Räikkönen was again fourth, followed by Rosberg, Alexander Wurz, Kubica and Schumacher. The McLarens of Hamilton and Alonso dropped to ninth and 12th respectively. McLaren boss Ron Dennis played down the times, saying the team was concentrating on tyre evaluation.|$|E
5|$|Population size {{is usually}} largest {{during the summer}} and declines during winter, {{although}} populations in Texas and Louisiana may be more seasonally stable. Animals also often lose weight during winter. Population size varies <b>dramatically</b> <b>from</b> year to year in southern Texas. In coastal Mississippi, storms probably do not cause the population to decline substantially, and in Texas, inundation of its habitat did not significantly influence population density. However, in Mississippi, flooding did cause a marked decline in rice rat abundance.|$|E

5|$|The {{economical}} situation Tubas {{during the}} 199399 period was prosperous, however {{since the start}} of the Second Intifada in 200001, Tubas' income level has decreased by roughly 40%. Prior to the Intifada, the average household income was 2,500 NIS, receding to about 1,500 NIS. A major factor that has resulted from the conflict was the confiscation of agricultural land located within the city's or its governorate's jurisdiction by Israeli settlements or military authorities. According to the PCBS, in 1999, approximately 52% of the citizens were within the working age (15-64). Of the city's labor force, 48% are females. The unemployment rate increased <b>dramatically</b> <b>from</b> 20% in 1999 to 70% after the year 2000. Prior to the Intifada, 35% of the total labor force worked in Israel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the reign}} of Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, {{targeting}} Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed <b>dramatically</b> <b>from</b> the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives. Yet Atenism {{may not have been}} full monotheism, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, like Shu. For these reasons, the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs.|$|E

25|$|In the 16th century, {{short-term}} interest rates dropped <b>dramatically</b> (<b>from</b> around 20–30% p.a. to around 9–10% p.a.).
