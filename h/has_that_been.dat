He says earlier in that episode that his young cousin bit him on the finger, and later calls his aunt to ask, [...] "Is Jordy a werewolf? Uh-huh. And how long <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>been</b> going on? Uh-huh." [...] To prevent himself from harming others, he takes to locking himself in a cage on the nights he'll turn. In season 4, however, he feels an undeniable attraction to Veruca, the female lead singer of a local band, and realizes why when he wakes up next to her after a wolf night on which he escaped his cage - he connect the dots and realizes she is a werewolf too, and she is happy to tell him they had given in to their animalistic desires for each other ("Wild at Heart"). Oz is powerless to resist his lust for Veruca, and after having sex with her in wolf form, he realizes that he is still harmful to others - namely his girlfriend Willow - and unable to defeat the wolf in him. This was {{despite the fact that}} when Veruca had pursued Willow, Oz interestingly seemed to retain some human memories and slaughters Veruca, suggesting he was able to prioritize his kills based on his human knowledge about Veruca (see below) and his affection for Willow. Still, he leaves Sunnydale for a few months, returning after having learned meditative techniques in Tibet that have allowed him to prevent changing ("New Moon Rising"). However, emotional stress, particularly over Willow and his jealousy over her new love interest Tara triggers the changes even during the day, and Oz realizes he has not defeated his lycanthropy as much as he thought he did, and departs again. He returns to Tibet to continue the Buddhist practices to hold back the wolf, but comes to the conclusion nothing works anymore. He is tempted to give in to his wolf side, but eventually doesn't, when fellow werewolf - and future mother of his child - Bayarmaa tells him of the original Tibetan religion Bon. The two build upon the religion and make their own traditions, seeing the spiritual life in ordinary things, quietly aware they are part of it all. They eventually learn that the secret is not to bottle up the wolf, but to let the energy of the wolf pass through them without taking them and into the world around them, letting [...] "the wolf be pulled into the earth."

In this thesis the levels and activities of ST A T 3 were measured in response to hypoxic insult in primary rat cardiomyocytes (RCMs) and two cardiomyocyte cell lines (H 9 c 2 and P 19 CL 6 cells). P 19 CL 6 cells were extremely sensitive to hypoxia-induced apoptosis whereas RCMs and H 9 c 2 cells were highly resistant. Apoptosis in P 19 CL 6 cells correlated with loss of STAT 3 DNA binding, which was preceded by serine phosphorylation and followed by loss of tyrosine phosphorylation. Treatment with LIF partially protected P 19 CL 6 cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis, as did exogenous expression of STAT 3 but not a redox-insensitive ST AT 3 mutant (STAT 3 C 3 s). Moreover, STAT 3 expression rescued mitochondrial ATP production during hypoxia whereas the redox-insensitive mutant did not. These data indicate that the contribution of STAT 3 to cardiomyocyte survival under hypoxic stress involves the maintenance of mitochondrial function by a redox-dependent mechanism. Understanding how STAT 3 is regulated in cardiomyocytes will be important for the development of therapeutic approaches for ischaemic heart disease in the future...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} the place in Bakhtin in Lawrence studies, first with some general points about the Bakhtinian readings of Lawrence; second with some of the key concepts in Bakhtin's theory revisited; and third, with the authors' own "Bakhtinian" reading of the lost girl (1920). The author argues that a Bakhtinian poetics has so far had only a limited purchase on Lawrence because it has been from the start fixated on trying to assess whether any of Lawrence's novels are truly "polyphonic," an approach which always comes down {{to the question of the}} relationship between the author and his characters. "Polyphony" is itself problematic within Bakhtinian poetics, and this paper asks what else Bakhtin has to contribute to our better understanding of Lawrence, even while there might not be a coherant body of theory that can simply and reliably be called upon. Lawrence critics have not only used Bakhtin in a limited way, but they have not questioned the coherance of the theory itself. Major claims have been made for the relevance of Bakhtin to Lawrence, and especially the Lawrence in the middle period, 1917 - 1921, when he became a comic writer. The biographical and historical formation of the humorous, and self-critical Lawrence of this period is partly the product of the new direction in Lawrence studies; but also partly the outcome of the new material available, especially in the letters and the Cambridge biographies, which characterizes a new author persona, and one which goes against the grain of that ponderous, humourless scourge of the modern world first put about by Norman Douglass and T. S. Eliot, and later promoted by Leavis, albeit for different motives. Critics now find themselves in the position of rereading this fiction, from this newer, belated perspective, as comedy, even while they acknowledge the continuing, underlying seriousness of Lawrence's writing. Coincidental with the turn towards comedy in Lawrence studies has been the attempt, since 1985, to theorize it through the work of Mikhail Bakhtin.

40|$|Deciding on a {{topic for}} the Presidential Address {{is no easy}} task. There {{seem to be a}} number of models. First, the light {{philosophical}} pastiche—the philosophical equivalent of a soufflé. Not only <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>been</b> done before 1, but I could not think of a subject. Second, the standard philosophical paper, focusing in tightly on some tiny part of the picture—but there are plenty of those around (too many, as I shall later argue!) and, in any case, a Presidential Address appears to demand something special. Third, the philosophical world-view, panning back to get the whole picture. That might better fit the special nature of the occasion, but it is beyond my skill to outline the big picture in a small compass. Fourth, the humorous after-dinner speech, full of wit, satire, and repartee. My predecessor, Greg Ray, delivered the perfect example last year, and one cannot improve on perfection. So that leaves what we might call the broad rumination, the reflective musing {{on the state of the}} discipline. The style of pondering whose generic title might be: Whither Philosophy? This genre is beset with dangers, as Greg so wittily showed us. It is hard to avoid being pompous, vacuous, or fatuous—or even all three at once. But I’ll have to risk that. I had been wondering for a while why I find a good deal of contemporary philosophy so tedious when someone drew my attention to a column by Jo Wolff (Head of the Philosophy Department at University College London) in a British newspaper. It begins: Why is academic writing so boring? I am impatient by nature, easily irritated, and afflicted with a short attention span. That I ended up in a job where I have to spend half the day blinking my way through artless, contorted prose is a cruel twist of fate. But the upside is that it gives me plenty of opportunity to reflect on why reading academic writing is so often a chore and so rarely a joy. Of course it is one of our more valuable chores. I tell my students that one reads academic work not for the pleasure of the moment but for what one comes away with. But still, a few moments of pleasure from time to time doesn’t seem a lo...|$|E

40|$|Diversifying crops {{for food}} and trade Suggested introduction: Across the Caribbean {{it is clear that}} {{agriculture}} needs to diversify. The loss of preferences in EU markets, for example, threatens the economic viability of traditional export crops such as sugar and bananas, and if farmers are to survive they will need to change what they grow, and how they grow it. So what are the options? One basic question is whether countries that traditionally import most of their food should be looking to increase the amount and variety of food crops grown on their own soil. Or should they simply grow other cash crops with strong export potential and sell these to fund continuing food imports? It?s a question that came under discussion at a recent conference focussing on food and nutrition security held in Belize. Susanna Thorp spoke to several participants about their vision of the future of agricultural diversity and trade, and how these link to the nutrition and food security of Caribbean people. In this report she begins by asking extension agent and agronomist, Richard Allport, about the situation regarding food, nutrition and trade, in his home country of Dominica. IN:		?Generally Dominica has always been considered [...] ? OUT:		? themselves as well as trade internationally. ? DUR?N		 8 ? 58 ? Back announcement: Sandra Plummer of the FAO ending that report on the links between crop diversification, income generation and supply of food in the Caribbean. Transcript Allport	Generally Dominica has always been considered as a food secure nation in terms of its food balance. Generally we have exported more food than we have imported in terms of value. However {{over the last few years}} we have seen some deterioration in the food and nutrition situation because we have seen some declines in the economy. Thorp	So why in particular has there been an impact on the economy, why <b>has</b> <b>that</b> <b>been</b> declining in the last couple of years? Allport	I think the major reason has been the decline of the banana industry and the whole question of the WTO negotiations and the impact on our economy. We now have a very open economy and many times we have been flooded with cheaper imports. That has caused a decline in incomes to farmers and as a result it has caused us to have less disposable income. Thorp	So what are you trying to do as an extension department to try and support farmers in this serious situation? Allport	The most effect that we can have is to try to raise productivity among farmers so that they can increase incomes. But we also would like our production to be consumed locally and many times we bring up issues of protection. Under our WTO obligations we cannot protect but there still is a reason why we need to protect our farmers. Furthermore I think that if our farmers are not protected it means that our country?s ability to even purchase from outside in the long run is affected. So if the economy is totally destroyed our ability to import is also destroyed or compromised. Thorp	And what about trying to diversify? If farmers have relied heavily on growing bananas in the past but this is not going to be a viable option in the future, what other options for growing other crops, perhaps more nutritional crops are there? Allport	Well the options are always there in terms of diversifying to feed our population. That is why I consider us still food secure. But then our ability to export agricultural produce is always compromised. So I think that is where the resources have to be put. Do we really have a comparative advantage in terms of exporting to other countries out there? So I think those are the real issues, it is not just the ability to feed ourselves but can we diversify into other crops that we can export like we did bananas for so many years. Thorp	And what about the issues of raising productivity, I mean how feasible is it to raise productivity beyond what you are doing already? Allport	I think it is feasible. We really have to embrace science and technology. But sometimes - even under our WTO obligations - raising productivity requires infrastructure and sometimes people see the required infrastructure as subsidies and they ask us not to subsidise. When the developed world?s agriculture is highly subsidised both in the EU and in the US. So those are other concerns of ours. Thorp	What about with policymakers, do you feel that they are doing enough to resolve the situation? Allport	I think our policymakers see it, but I think many times our hands are tied in terms of the kind of resources that we can generate to make those changes. I mean we are a poor underdeveloped country striving to compete in the developed world. NARR	In St Kitts and Nevis the government is already in the process of planning which crops it should prioritise, as it reduces its dependence on sugar exports. Jeffrey Berry, an extension officer with the Department of Agriculture, is concerned that this process is ignoring the capacity that the country?s own farmers have, to contribute to the national food supplies. Berry	Yes we have to feed a nation, but are the people, the population, the farmers benefiting from feeding ourselves? Thorp		Presumably they are not? Berry	They are not because what is really happening is that when we set out to look what crops should we produce we are looking from a marketing point of view as to what crops can we produce competitively, not necessarily to feed our nation. So I think somewhere along the line we have to draw the line and to break a kind of equilibrium as to production first of all in feeding yourself, feeding up to at least certain basic commodities. Thorp	Is there a possibility of being able to diversify so that farmers can grow some competitive crops but they can also be encouraged to grow nutritionally valuable crops too? Berry	That is the approach we are trying to do because St Kitts is moving out of sugar right now. I think this year is the last year that we are producing sugar for export. So we are looking at a diversification programme. And I think this is the downfall of the whole thing: we are going about it kind of one sided in the sense that we are just looking at it from a marketing point of view as to what kinds of crops we can produce competitively. I think we have to look at producing other crops that are nutritionally beneficial for the nation, on a smaller scale, but I think that is an integral part that we have to look at apart from the crops that we are producing to be competitive. NARR	While Jeffrey Berry stresses the importance of farmers growing at least some of their crops for domestic consumption, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is currently running a pilot project to support farmers in production of some alternative cash crops. Sandra Plummer, a food security specialist with the project, which is operating in the 15 member states of CARICOM plus the Dominican Republic, explained how it is working. Plummer	You know that we have a lot of problems in terms of especially sugar and banana because of the erosion of the preferences with the European Union. I think countries are now in transition, in terms of where they should go where they would not be so dependent upon those preferences. Thorp	So what is the FAO pilot project doing to support farmers in this transition phase? Plummer	The project actually is attempting to improve the productivity of these selected crops and it is basically cash crops with the potential for trade in what we call the non-traditional commodities which find markets in places like Canada, the United States. Especially in those areas where you have the West Indian diaspora who are accustomed to eating a particular type of food and they are willing to buy it. So there is a kind of niche market there. Thorp	So what sort of interventions or technologies are you putting into place in order to support the growing of those crops? Plummer	The technology that is being used is drip irrigation because in many countries they have a problem of water and the management of the water. Thorp	So with having irrigation does this allow farmers to grow crops outside the traditional seasons? Plummer	That is exactly the whole point because what happens is that I can give you an example of one village in a country where everybody grew the same kind of crop. So you had a glut during the actual reaping season and then between seasons you had a deficit in terms of availability of food as well as availability of income. So the drip irrigation actually helps to stagger the production throughout the year so that the troughs and the heights of the cycle will actually be reduced. So you get little blips instead of huge hills and valleys. Thorp	So are there countries where there are particular lessons that would be valuable do you think that are already coming out of the project? Plummer	The country which has gone the furthest and has actually started to reap the first crop cycle is Belize. And I think Belize has the advantage and it is probably the reason why they were one of the first countries to actually start the production, in that they already have an intersectoral Animal Health and Food Safety Agency which co-ordinates all the requirements from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture and Trade. And hence it makes it easier for persons who are wishing to export crops. They do not need to go to eight different departments. They can go to one agency and get all the paperwork and documentation done. Thorp		So how do you see the way forward for the future? Plummer	I think in terms of regional development, as in Caribbean region, we hope to get a framework of food and nutrition security strategy for the region, which would then be able to advise programmes and plans of action of the different CARICOM and CARIFORUM member states. I think part of the process is the establishment of, for example, regional databases, regional marketing intelligence, so countries can all access it and be able to trade amongst themselves as well as trade internationally.
