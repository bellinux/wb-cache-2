500|$|Linda S. Ghent, Professor in the Department of Economics at Eastern Illinois University, {{discusses}} {{some economic}} {{issues in this}} episode. Just before Jerry's dare about the egg roll, Elaine says, [...] "You know, it's not fair people are seated first come first served. It {{should be based on}} who's hungriest. I feel like just <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and taking some food off somebody's plate." [...] Ghent discusses the history and reasoning behind rationing mechanisms and economic efficiency, which are the bases behind how tables are seated at restaurants, rationales which are perhaps invisible to hungry or impatient customers. Elaine's attempt at bribery is an example of opportunity cost: the trio are willing to pay more than usual to get a table, if it means Elaine can eat sooner and Jerry makes it to the movie on time. Ghent also gives Jerry's willingness to lie to his uncle as another example of opportunity cost: [...] "Did I do a bad thing by lying to my uncle and saying I couldn't go to dinner? Plan Nine from Outer Space – one night only, the big screen! My hands are tied!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrew Flintoff, England's captain, {{called the}} series [...] "the reason we play ... we are <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> {{to play in}} what could be the biggest series ever so there is an excited group of lads... {{it is going to be}} tough. We know that 2005 was {{something}} special and whether that can be recreated I am not quite sure... in England each Test match got bigger and bigger and we got a real feeling of what the Ashes was about." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{thoroughly}} {{enjoyed it}} and the preparation has been great. The big thing {{that came out of}} it was that I played at three Test grounds I'm going to be playing on and got to experience them before this big series coming up. Lord's was my home ground there for Middlesex and I played at The Oval as well and Edgbaston. It couldn't have really worked out any better. The big thing was just <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> to experience the whole different culture really, the weather, the wickets and the bowlers as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure it's all right. We can ride, can't we?" [...] {{retorted}} Florence. [...] "Better have a {{care for}} yourself, <b>going</b> off <b>over</b> <b>there</b> to mix in goodness knows what." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>going</b> to slip <b>over</b> <b>there</b> {{just as soon}} as {{the lights}} are turned down," [...] he said to Fred. [...] "If they are {{hatching}} out any mischief perhaps we'll hear something worth listening to." ...|$|R
5000|$|That evening, Niccoló {{comes to}} the Grayson villa for dinner, {{accompanied}} by his brother, Osvaldo (Ignazio Oliva). After dinner, the young people separate from the adults to smoke marijuana. Lucy is now able to laugh about Parrish's betrayal, and the group take turns recounting when they each lost their virginity. When the question comes around to Osvaldo, he demurs, saying, [...] "I don't know which is more ridiculous, this conversation or the silly political one <b>going</b> on <b>over</b> <b>there</b> the grown-ups' table." [...] Lucy fawns over Niccoló but abruptly vomits in his lap.|$|R
2500|$|The Germans {{used to tell}} me, and I got to {{know them}} well because I played soccer against them and with them and so forth. But they {{used to tell me}} that you guys are blessed. What we know about the Indians in Canada. They are blessed. But that blessing is being {{destroyed}} by your immigrants that are <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there.</b> Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well. But there's going to be a war because the Israelis and the “Bushies” [...] you know, the bully, the bigot in the United States [...] tells you that if you're not with me you're against me.|$|E

2500|$|Savage {{strongly}} supported the War in Iraq in October 2002, stating [...] "Free your people, reform your societies, liberalize, and democratize... or we're <b>going</b> to come <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> remove you from power, free your people, and reform your societies for ourselves." [...] By {{the time of}} the U.S. invasion in March 2003, however, he opposed the war.|$|R
60|$|As his {{exhaustion}} vanished {{he began}} to note things. The men had secured the boom; but the schooner's bows looked bare and he remembered the jibs had blown away. The foresail was torn and half-lowered, and the gaff at its head was jambed. The torn canvas kept the vessel from falling off the wind, but would not bring her up {{enough for her to}} lie to. Masts and deck were horribly slanted, the windward bulwark was hove high up, and luminous spray drove across its top. It looked as if she were <b>going</b> <b>over</b> and <b>there</b> was an appalling din, for the scream of the tornado pierced the thunder.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad business, this! She's {{pounding}} on a reef 'bout {{a quarter of}} a mile out. They're sure she's going to break up--old tub, you know--leaky--rotten. The sea's tremenjus high, and the surfs <b>going</b> dean <b>over</b> her. <b>There</b> can't be no boat launched for hours yet--they'll all be drowned. Old Paul's down there like a madman--offering everything he's got to the man who'll save Oscar, but it can't be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why? Just now, at the school-house, I {{answered}} {{a letter that}} was brought to me from Chaldicotes. Sowerby insists on my <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> {{for a week or}} so; and I have said that I would." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let it burn," [...] he said, glancing {{through a}} window at the lurid light of the conflagration. [...] "We couldn't be of any use <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and, after all, it isn't our affair to relieve Skeelty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{she chooses}} to stay with Mrs. Bromley! I'm sure it's quite enough for you and mamma to do duty--and Emily, {{who wants to know}} why Mr. Calvert raves so about her--without MY <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> to stare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm out in {{the wild}} country, but it ain't what I [...] want. I don't like it here. The cowboys are all the time [...] rowin'. There ain't much game here neither. I kill an [...] {{antelope}} once in a while, or a deer down on the bottoms, but [...] I haven't seen a bear or a buffalo yet. I {{want to go to}} the [...] mountains now. This country is too tame for me. They say you [...] can see the Rockies from a place about one hundred miles from [...] here. Some day I'm <b>going</b> to ride <b>over</b> <b>there</b> and take a [...] look. I haven't seen any Indians yet. We are likely to have [...] shooting soon.|$|R

50|$|Reveriego was in Madrid, {{assisting}} fashion photographers when Pop {{came out}} {{he became a}} fan of photographers Mert & Marcus, {{he wanted to go}} to London and ask for a job. It was very difficult since he didn’t speak fluent English but after trying several times, <b>going</b> <b>there</b> <b>over</b> and over again, he got the job. Miguel met their first assistant at the moment and through her, he got an interview with them. At that time Mert & Marcus have just bought their house in Ibiza and they were looking for someone who could speak Spanish and it happened. What he attributes to that period of his career, it's how clear the concept of the woman was.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{located the}} house and are <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> right after we eat," [...] {{answered}} the senator's son. [...] "And by the way, Mr. Dillon," [...] he continued. [...] "Do you know any men named Blugg, Jaley, and Staver?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was right}} glad when I {{heard that they}} had given her back Kilgowrie. It is but a corner of your father's lands; but I {{remember}} the old house well, <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> once, when I was staying with your grandfather, to see his mother, who was then living there. How much land goes with it?" ...|$|E
60|$|Granted {{that men}} are still men, Labour v. Capitalism is a tragic struggle. If men {{are no more than}} implements, it is non-tragic and merely disastrous. In tragedy the man is more than his part. Hamlet is more than Prince of Denmark, Macbeth is more than murderer of Duncan. The man is caught in the wheels of his part, his fate, he may be torn asunder. He may be killed, but the resistant, {{integral}} soul in him is not destroyed. He comes through, though he dies. He goes through with his fate, though death swallows him. And it is in this facing of fate, this going right through with it, that tragedy lies. Tragedy is not disaster. It is a disaster when a cart-wheel goes over a frog, {{but it is not a}} tragedy, not the hugest; not the death of ten million men. It is only a cartwheel <b>going</b> <b>over</b> a frog. <b>There</b> must be a supreme STRUGGLE.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know," [...] Mr Jackson said, {{when he had}} {{finished}} the letter; [...] "your father makes me a very liberal offer, Dick, for my waggon and team for six months, on the condition that I allow Tom to accompany them, and he points out that in his opinion a journey of this kind will be likely to develop the boy's character and teach him many things that may some day be of use to him. It comes upon me suddenly, and it seems he wants the waggon and team to be at Newcastle this evening, ready for a start in the morning. He himself is <b>going</b> to ride <b>over</b> <b>there</b> to purchase goods to freight it directly he receives my reply. I must go in and consult with mother before I come to any decided conclusion." ...|$|R
5000|$|Executive {{producer}} Jeffrey Bell, on {{the decision}} to introduce the character known previously in the MCU only as [...] "the cellist" [...] here, said, [...] "there’s that one line and suddenly it’s who is this person? And what is this person? And {{when are we going}} to see this person? And we talked about it a number of times over the season, and we had different versions and different ideas how to get there....at a time when Coulson's at his most vulnerable, it seemed to be a good choice for us." [...] Concerning the character of Blackout, Bell stated that [...] "He’s the antagonist, in the same way we’ve used other Marvel characters as antagonists in the episodes. At the same time, we’re dealing with the fall-out of what happened with S.H.I.E.L.D., and the viewers finding out about Ward and what’s <b>going</b> on <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> so there’s a lot going on. Emotionally, he’s perfect. Here’s a character who absorbs light, and one of the things he says to Audrey - which is the title of the episode - he refers to her as “the only light in the darkness.” And his obsession with the cellist is a beautiful metaphor, I think, for who Coulson is to her, who she is to Coulson, who S.H.I.E.L.D. is to the world…and the idea of S.H.I.E.L.D. falling apart, and Hydra coming out and darkness speaking, the idea of having Blackout as an antagonist seemed perfect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Old bones don't {{rest and}} recover {{as quickly as}} young bones, and I just don't feel equal to <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> now," [...] said she. [...] "The truth is, Reddy, I am growing old. I am going to stay right here and rest. Perhaps then I'll feel able to go hunting to-night. You trot along now, {{and if you get}} more than a stomachful, just {{remember}} old Granny and bring her a bite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{shall not}} forget my dignity nor humble myself by <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> to {{apologize}} as Penelope has. SHE {{can do as}} she likes; {{and now that he}} has asked to be forgiven, there is perhaps no harm in HER seeing the old lady. But with me it is different. I was insulted, and till Thomas Dover conies here and solemnly asks my pardon I will NOT cross his threshold, no matter what bribes he sends," [...] said Miss Henny, with an air of heroic firmness.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what Lady Julia says, and I {{always find}} {{her to be}} right in things of that sort. And she says you'll {{have a better chance}} in <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there</b> than you would here, if she were in the same house with you. If I was going to make love to a girl, of course I'd sooner have her close to me,--staying in the same house. I should think it the best fun in the world. And we might have had a dance, {{and all that kind of}} thing. But I couldn't make her come, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thought," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "that you both {{understood}} this business, but I don't mind <b>going</b> <b>over</b> it again. <b>There</b> {{is no doubt}} in my mind that this gold originally belonged to the Incas, who then owned Peru, and they put it into that mound to keep it from the Spaniards, whose descendants now own Peru, and who rule it without much regard to the descendants of the ancient Peruvians. Now, when I discovered the gold, and began to have an idea of how valuable the find was, I knew that the first thing to do was to get it out of that place and away from the country. Whatever is to be done in the way of fair play and fair division must be done somewhere else, and not there. If I had informed the government of what I had found, this gold would have gone directly into the hands of the descendants of the people from whom its original owners did their very best to keep it, and nobody else would have had a dollar's worth of it. If we had stood up for our rights to a reward for finding it, ten to one we would all have been clapped into prison." ...|$|R

6000|$|A former Consul at ----, whom I know, {{has told}} me a good many stories about the pieces of popular mind which he {{received}} at different times from the travelling public, in reproof of his difficulty of discovery; and I think it {{must be one of}} the most jealously guarded rights of American citizens in foreign lands to declare the national representative hard to find, if there is no other complaint to lodge against him. It seems to be, in peculiar degree, a quality of consulship at ----, to be found remote and inaccessible. My friend says that even at New York, before setting out for his post, when inquiring into the history of his predecessors, he heard that they were one and all hard to find; and he relates that on the steamer, <b>going</b> <b>over,</b> <b>there</b> was a low fellow who set the table in a roar by a vulgar anecdote to this effect:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, Clara quite saw all that, but--and {{here she}} sank her voice {{so that there}} was hardly any left--as Felix was <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> she really must put him au courant with the heart of this matter. Lady Malloring had told her the whole story. It {{appeared}} there were two cases: A family called Gaunt, an old man, and his son, who had two daughters--one of them, Alice, quite a nice girl, was kitchen-maid here at Becket, but the other sister--Wilmet--well! {{she was one of those}} girls that, as Felix must know, were always to be found in every village. She was leading the young men astray, and Lady Malloring had put her foot down, telling her bailiff to tell the farmer for whom Gaunt worked that he and his family must go, unless they sent the girl away somewhere. That was one case. And the other was of a laborer called Tryst, who wanted to marry his deceased wife's sister. Of course, whether Mildred Malloring was not rather too churchy and puritanical--now that a deceased wife's sister was legal--Clara did not want to say; but she was undoubtedly within her rights if she thought it for the good of the village. This man, Tryst, was a good workman, and his farmer had objected to losing him, but Lady Malloring had, of course, not given way, and if he persisted he would get put out. All the cottages about there were Sir Gerald Malloring's, so that in both cases it would mean leaving the neighborhood. In regard to village morality, as Felix knew, the line must be drawn somewhere.|$|E
6000|$|Now, my friends, ... I ask the {{attention}} of the people here assembled, and elsewhere, to the course that Judge Douglas is pursuing every day as bearing upon this question of making slavery national. Not going back to the records, but taking the speeches he makes, the speeches he made yesterday and the day before, and makes constantly, all over the country, I ask your attention to them. In the first place, what is necessary to make the institution national? Not war: there is no danger that the people of Kentucky will shoulder their muskets and ... march into Illinois to force the blacks upon us. There is no danger of our <b>going</b> <b>over</b> <b>there,</b> and making war upon them. Then what is necessary for the nationalization of slavery? It is simply the next Dred Scott decision. It is merely for the Supreme Court to decide that no State under the Constitution can exclude it, just as they have already decided that under the Constitution neither Congress nor the territorial legislature can do it. When that is decided and acquiesced in, the whole thing is done. This being true and this being the way, as I think, that slavery is to be made national, let us consider what Judge Douglas is doing every day to that end. In the first place, let us see what influence he is exerting on public sentiment. In this and like communities, public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed. Consequently he who moulds public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes or pronounces decisions. He makes statutes and decisions possible or impossible to be executed. This must be borne in mind, as also the additional fact that Judge Douglas is a man of vast influence, so great that it is enough for many men to profess to believe anything when they once find out that Judge Douglas professes to believe it. Consider also the attitude he occupies {{at the head of a}} large party,--a party which he claims has a majority of all the voters in the country.|$|E
