40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the success rates for excimer laser-assisted {{coronary}} angioplasty performed in patients undergoing angioplasty for lesions containing thrombus. Background. The presence of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> increases the risk of a poor clinical outcome after balloon angioplasty. The effect of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> on the safety and efficacy of excimer laser-assisted coronary angioplasty is unknown. Methods. Percutaneous excimer laser-assisted coronary angioplasty was attempted in 142 patients, of whom 12 had angiographic evidence of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> in 14 lesions, defined as a filling defect sarrounded by contrast medium or an area of contrast staining. Results. Clinical success (< 50 % residual stenosis without myocardial infarction, death or bypass surgery at any time during hospitalization) was achieved in 7 (58 %) of the 12 patients with <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus,</b> compared with 123 (95 %) of the 130 patients without thrombus (p = 0. 00001). Angiographic and clinical complications were more common in patients with thrombus: embolization (25 % vs. 1 %, p < 0. 001), myocardial infarction (33 % vs. 2 %, p < 0. 001), abrupt closure (17 % vs. 4 %, p = 0. 049). Angiographic restenosis at 6 months was seen at 7 (70 %) of 10 treated sites with <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> and at 59 (51 %) of 116 sites without thrombus (p = 0. 245).

40|$|BACKGROUND: An <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> during {{regional}} ischemia {{is related}} to life-threatening arrhythmias. The electrophysiological consequences of a thrombus are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In open chest pigs, regional ischemia was induced by intracoronary injection of a thrombus (protocol 1). In protocol 2, coronary ligation was followed by injection of heparinized blood. Three consecutive episodes of ischemia (10 minutes) and reperfusion (20 minutes) were studied in protocols 3 and 4 (ligation). During the former, an <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> started the third period of ischemia. Multiple (78) local electrograms were recorded simultaneously, and activation patterns were determined. In a first period of ischemia, ventricular fibrillation (during the first 10 minutes) occurred more often after intracoronary thrombosis than during the other protocols (4 / 7 versus 2 / 19, P <. 05) despite similar size of the ischemic tissue. The incidence of delayed arrhythmias (between 15 and 30 minutes) was not different. Epicardial activation delay was larger 2 to 4 minutes after intracoronary thrombosis compared with ligation. ST elevation was larger with than without a thrombus (2 minutes of ischemia, 12. 9 +/- 4. 1 versus 8. 2 +/- 3. 0 mV; +/-SD, P <. 05). In protocols 3 and 4 the second period and third period of ischemia were similar irrespective {{of the presence of}} an <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus.</b> CONCLUSIONS: More conduction slowing underlies the profibrillatory effect of an <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> relative to coronary ligation.

40|$|Background. The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of the fibrinolytic system in patients with unstable angina at rest associated with transient electrocardiographic changes. Methods and Results. Tissue plasminogen activator activity in plasma was comparable among patients with unstable angina (n = 17), patients with stable exertional angina (n = 10), and control patients with normal coronary arteriograms (n= 8). In contrast, plasminogen activator inhibi-tor- 1 (PAI- 1) activity in plasma was elevated in the unstable angina group (21. 67 ±+ 9. 52 AU/mi) as compared with either the stable angina group (12. 01 ±+ 7. 06 AU/mil, p< 0. 02) or the controls (12. 49 ± 8. 54 AU/mil, p< 0. 02). Coronary angiography performed within 24 hours after the last anginal episode showed a similar extent of coronary artery disease in the unstable and stable angina groups. However, <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi</b> were observed in eight patients in the unstable angina group while no thrombus was noted in the stable angina group (, 2 = 7. 22, p < 0. 01). Conclusions.

To determine if thrombolysis could be beneficial when combined with maximal medical therapy, 40 patients with rest angina, angiographically documented coronary artery disease and pacing-induced ischemia were randomly assigned to intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA, 150 mg/ 8 h) or placebo in a prospective double-blind trial. All patients received nitrates, a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, a calcium channel blocker, aspirin and heparin. Pacing thresholds for ischemia and quantitative coronary stenosis were measured before and after infusion of the study medication. <b>Intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> was identified angiographically before infusion of the study medication in 16 patients; 7 eceived rt-PA and 9 received placebo. The ischemic pacing threshold in patients treated with rt-PA increased from 112 ± 4 beats/min at baseline to 127 ± 5 beats/min (p = 0. 007) {{by the end of the}} infusion versus an insignificant change in patients who received placebo (from 116 ± 4 to 119 ± 4 beats/min, p = NS). In patients with <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus,</b> the ischemic pacing threshold increased 267 beats/ min with rt-PA treatment versus 0 ± 3 beats/min with placebo (p = 0. 004). In contrast, in patients without thrombus, there was no difference in ischemic pacing threshold increments between treatment groups (7 ± 11 beats/min for rt-PA versus 65 beats/min for placebo, p = NS). Percent diameter stenosis in the ischemia-related artery decreased from 71 ± 4 % to 63 ± 6 % (p = NS) in patients treated with rt-PA and from 70 ± 4 % to 67 ± 5 % (p = NS) in patients treated with placebo. There were no significant differences in clinical outcome or incidence of asymptomatic ST segment change between treatment groups.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{technique}} for staging {{the generation of}} obstructive thrombi in the coronary arteries of conscious dogs is described. At thoracotomy, electrodes are placed in the lumina of coronary artery branches. When thrombus generation in proximity to the intraluminal etectrode tip is desired, anodal current {{is applied to the}} exteriorised end of the electrode. In each of nine anaesthetised adult mongrel dogs two to seven intracoronary electrodes were implanted for a total of 35. One to 75 days later, 50 to 800 p A anodal current was applied to 16 electrodes for 30 min to 48 h. Upon autopsy, thrombi in various stages of organisation were found in proximity to the intracoronary portion of 15 electrodes. Six electrodes were found to be damaged or broken. In contrast, only four of the 13 control electrodes were sites of thrombus formation. In seven dogs tissue sections indicated either myocardial ischaemia or infarct in regions whose perfusion was blocked by thrombi. This method may provide for discretionary generation of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi</b> in the desired quantity, at the preferred site(s), at selected times of onset.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi</b> in the culprit lesions in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by angioscopy, and to compare them with clinical and angiographic features. We angioscopically observed the culprit coronary lesions in 66 patients with AMI (55 males and 11 females, 63. 9 ± 15. 4 years old) just before interventional therapy. Thrombi were observed in 42 of 66 lesions (64 %), namely, red thrombi in 16, mixed thrombi in 15, white thrombi in 11. In patients with complete obstruction (TIMI grade 0 and I), red thrombi were more frequently observed than mixed or white thrombi. On the other hand, in patients with incomplete obstruction (TIMI grade II and III), white thrombi were more frequently observed than the others. Angiographically, haziness and filling defect were significantly more frequently observed in patients with red thrombi than the others (p< 0. 05).

The coronary angiograms of 50 patients with prolonged rest angina without myocardial infarction (group I) and 42 concurrent patients with stable angina (group II) were reviewed without knowledge of the clinical syndrome. Patients with prior myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass graft surgery were excluded, as were patients with important aortic stenosis. Each coronary artery stenosis in a major epicardial vessel was evaluated for the presence or absence of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> (defined using standard criteria), complex lesion morphology (defined as the presence of haziness, a smudged appearance or irregular lesion margins) and eccentricity, and the frequency of each of these findings in groups I and II was compared. <b>Intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> was present significantly more often in group I patients (42 %) than in group II patients (17 %) (χ 25. 77; p < 0. 02).

40|$|Intake {{of large}} amounts of added {{sweeteners}} {{has been associated with}} the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic risk. Several studies have shown that fructose increases the cardiovascular risk by modulating endothelial dysfunction and promoting atherosclerosis. Recently, a potential role for fructose in cardiovascular thrombosis has been suggested but with controversial results. Tissue factor (TF) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular thrombosis by triggering the formation of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi</b> following endothelial injury. This study investigates the effects of fructose, in a concentration range usually observed in the plasma of patients with increased cardiovascular risk, on TF in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs).

Finally, a potential molecular pathway involved in modulating this phenomenon was investigated. We demonstrate that fructose induces transcription of mRNA for TF. In addition, we show that this monosaccharide promotes surface expression of TF that is functionally active. Fructose effects on TF appear modulated by the oxygen free radicals through activation of the transcription factor NF-κB since superoxide dismutase and NF-κB inhibitors suppressed TF expression.

40|$|Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) is a {{metalloproteinase}} with {{a controversial}} role in pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease.

However, the pathophysiological link(s) between PAPP-A and ACS are still unknown. Several studies have indicated that tissue factor (TF) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of ACS by triggering the formation of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi</b> following endothelial injury. This study investigates whether PAPP-A, at concentrations measurable in ACS patients, might induce TF expression in human endothelial cells in culture (HUVEC).

PAPP-A induced TF expression through the activation of Akt/NF-κB axis, as demonstrated by luciferase assay and by suppression of TF-mRNA transcription as well as of TF expression/activity by Akt and NF-κB inhibitors. These data indicate that PAPP-A promotes TF expression in human endothelial cells and support the hypothesis that this proteinase, besides being involved in progression of atherosclerosis, does not represent an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events, but it rather might play an "active" role in the pathophysiology of ACS as an effector molecule able to induce a pro-thrombotic phenotype in endothelial cells...|$|R

We therefore studied the age of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi,</b> aspirated during angioplasty in patients with acute STEMI. Methods and Results - Percutaneous intracoronary thrombectomy during angioplasty was performed in 211 consecutive STEMI patients within 6 hours after onset of anginal symptoms. The aspirated material was histologically screened on thrombus and plaque components, and thrombus age was classified as fresh (5 days). In all patients, intracoronary-derived material was retrieved in the filter of the collection bottle. Thrombus was identified in 199 (95 %) of 211 patients. In 12 patients (5 %), only plaque components were identified, and in 85 patients (41 %), both thrombus and plaque material were aspirated.

BackgroundAVDE of atherosclerotic and thrombotic material {{has been shown to}} impair myocardial perfusion and contribute to poor clinical outcome in patients with STEMI. Recent studies have shown that thrombus composition and size are associated with the incidence of AVDE. MethodsAspirated thrombi from 164 STEMI patients within 12 h of symptom onset were investigated immunohistochemically using antibodies against platelets, erythrocytes, and inflammatory cells. ResultsThe angiographic results showed that AVDE during p-PCI occurred in 22 (13. 4 %) patients. Pathological analysis revealed that thrombi from patients with AVDE had a greater erythrocyte-positive area (60 ± 15 % vs. 43 ± 21 %, p < 0. 0005) and more myeloperoxidase-positive cells (943 ± 324 cells/mm 2 vs. 592 ± 419 cells/mm 2, p < 0. 0005) than those from patients without AVDE. Thrombus size, quantified as the thrombus surface area, was positively correlated with the erythrocyte component (r = 0. 362, p < 0. 0001). Moreover, multivariate logistic analysis demonstrated that erythrocyte-positive area in the thrombi, glucose levels on admission, larger vessel diameter (≥ 3. 5 mm), and pre-balloon dilation were independent predictors of the incidence of AVDE.

40|$|Plaque rupture (PR) and {{superimposed}} thrombosis {{have been}} shown as the most frequent underlying substrate in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Coronary angiography is a luminogram not able to define in vivo features of the culprit plaques. The aim {{of the study was}} to use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to investigate the pathology underlying complex (CL) and non-complex angiographic lesions (NCL). We retrospectively enrolled 107 ACS patients admitted to our institution; 83 with non-ST elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS) and 24 with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography was performed and culprit lesions were classified according to Ambrose criteria into NCL (n = 47) and CL (n = 60). OCT imaging was then performed to better identify plaque morphology; either PR or intact fibrous cap, the presence of superimposed thrombosis, lipid rich plaque, and thin cap fibroatheroma (TCFA). OCT analysis showed that 58 lesions (54. 2 %) were classified as PR and 48 lesions (44. 9 %) were associated with thrombi. Lipid rich plaques were identified in 62 lesions (57. 9 %). PR, <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi,</b> lipid rich plaques and TCFA were more frequent in CL compared with NCL (71. 7 vs 31. 9 %, 63. 3 vs 21. 3 %, 71. 7 vs 40. 4 % and 46. 7 vs 21. 3 % respectively), but PR with superimposed thrombus may be also detected in NCL. OCT demonstrates PR and thrombosis in the majority of ACS patients presenting with CL. However, one-third of NCL show PR by OCT, suggesting that additional intracoronary imaging by OCT may better identify the underlying mechanism of coronary instability than coronary angiography alone...|$|R
40|$|Adipocytes are cells able {{to produce}} and secrete several active {{substances}} (adipokines) with direct effects on vascular cells. Apelin, {{one of the most}} recently identified adipokines has been studied in cardiovascular system physiology in regard to vessel vasodilation and myocardial contraction, but it has not yet completely characterised for its pathophysiological role in cardiovascular disease and especially in acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Several studies have indicated that tissue factor (TF) plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of ACS by triggering the formation of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi</b> following endothelial injury. This study investigates the effects of apelin 12 and apelin 13 on TF in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) and monocytes. Cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of apelin 12 or apelin 13 and then processed to evaluate TF-mRNA levels by real-time PCR as well as TF expression/activity by FACS analysis and pro-coagulant activity. Finally, a potential molecular pathway involved in modulating this phenomenon was investigated. We demonstrate that apelin 13 but not apelin 12 induces transcription of mRNA for TF. In addition, we show that this adipokine promotes surface expression of TF that is functionally active. Apelin 13 effects on TF appear modulated by the activation of the G-protein-transcription factor nuclear factor (NF) k�B axis since G-protein inhibitors suppressed NF-kB mediated TF expression. Data of the present study, although in vitro, indicate that apelin- 13, induces a procoagulant phenotype in HUVECs and monocytes by promoting TF expression. These observations support the hypothesis that this adipokine might play a relevant role as an active partaker in athero-thrombotic disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{limitations}} of angiography {{for the detection}} of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus</b> are well recognized. Between November 1991 and July 1994, we performed 402 angioscopy procedures in 225 vessels in 202 patients, with the Image-Cath (Baxter). We performed a prospective study in 190 of these patients, who had an interpretable angioscopy performed just before PTCA to determine the sensitivity and specificity of predetermined angiographic criteria that are considered to be indicative of the presence of <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombus.</b> Angiographically verified thrombus was used as the gold standard for comparison. Lesions were classified on angiography (2 orthogonal views) by independent observers. The presence of an intraluminal filling defect, of overhanging edges, of haziness, or of ulceration were noted. The characteristic ulceration was not mutually exclusive of the other 3 characteristics. Of 15 filling defects on angiography 14 (93 %) had thrombus on angiography; in the 23 lesions with overhanging edges 19 (83 %) had thrombus on angioscopy; in the 27 ulcerated lesions 21 (78 %) had angioscopic thrombus; in the 6 lesions that were hazy on angiography 5 had angioscopic thrombus.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study used}} angioscopy to {{determine}} the specific cause of vessel occlusion after {{percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty}} and compared the angiographic and angioscopic lesion morphologies in this setting. Background. Occlusion of a dilated coronary artery is the major cause of morbidity and mortality after coronary angioplasty. Attempts to reopen occluded vessels are either empirically guided or directed by angiography, which has inherent limitations. Angioscopy, the in vivo direct visualization of the endovascular surface, is potentially a more accurate means of identifying the cause of vessel occlusion after angioplasty. Methods. Percutaneous coronary angioscopy was performed in 17 patients (17 vessels) after angiographic confirmation of postangioplasty vessel occlusion. Results. Angioscopy demonstrated the primary cause of the postangioplasty occlusion to be dissection in 14 patients (82 %) and <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi</b> in 3 (18 %). Compared with angioscopy, angiography was significantly less accurate in identifying the specific cause of the occlusion and correctly identified the cause of vessel occlusion in only 5 (29 %) of 17 patients (p < 0. 001), including 4 (29 %) of 14 deep dissections and 1 (33 %) of 3 occlusive thrombi. Conclusions. Angioscopy specifically identified the cause of occlusion in every patient, with coronary dissection the predominant cause of abrupt occlusion after coronary angioplasty. However, angiography was unable to identifiy a specific cause for vessel occlusion in the majority of our patients. Angioscopy may therefore prove useful in selecting specific treatment strategies for patients with abrupt occlusion after angioplasty, such as stent placement, atherectomy, repeat dilation or thrombolysis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{compared}} {{the results of}} percutaneous angioscopy and angiography for detecting critical elements of surface lesion morphology in 21 patients undergoing balloon angioplasty of saphenous vein coronary bypass grafts. Background. Angiography remains the standard for diagnosing and treating intravascular pathology associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. It has been demonstrated that coronary angioscopy is more sensitive for identifying more complex atherosclerotic plaques and <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi</b> in native coronary arteries. Methods. Angioscopy and angiography were performed before and after angioplasty of “culprit lesions” in bypass grafts. All {{but one of the}} patients had unstable angina. The mean age of the saphenous vein coronary bypass grafts was 10. 1 ± 2. 4 years (range 5 to 15). Results. Restesosis at a prior angioptasty site was present in seven patients. Intravascalar thrombi were seen by angioscopy in 15 (71 %) of 21 versus 4 (19 %) of 21 grafts by angiography (p < 0. 001). Dissection was identified by angioscony in 14 (66 %) of 21 versus 2 (9. 5 %) of 21 grafts by angiograpay (p < 0. 01). The presence of friable plaque liung the Iumen surface of the vein graft was detected by angioscopy in 11 (52 %) of 21 versus 4 (19 %) of 21 grafts by angiography (p < 0. 05). There was no correlation between age of the bypass graft and the finding of friable plaque. Conclusions. We conclude that angioscopy is superior to angiography for detecting complex lesion merphology ta bypass grafts and that the presence of friable plaque does not preclude an uncomplicated angioplasty procedure...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the association between pathological characteristics of aspirated <b>intracoronary</b> <b>thrombi</b> and the incidence of angiographically visible distal embolization (AVDE) during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (p-PCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with thrombus aspiration. AVDE of atherosclerotic and thrombotic material {{has been shown to}} impair myocardial perfusion and contribute to poor clinical outcome in patients with STEMI. Recent studies have shown that thrombus composition and size are associated with the incidence of AVDE. Aspirated thrombi from 164 STEMI patients within 12 h of symptom onset were investigated immunohistochemically using antibodies against platelets, erythrocytes, and inflammatory cells. The angiographic results showed that AVDE during p-PCI occurred in 22 (13. 4 %) patients. Pathological analysis revealed that thrombi from patients with AVDE had a greater erythrocyte-positive area (60 ± 15 % vs. 43 ± 21 %, p < 0. 0005) and more myeloperoxidase-positive cells (943 ± 324 cells/mm(2) vs. 592 ± 419 cells/mm(2), p < 0. 0005) than those from patients without AVDE. Thrombus size, quantified as the thrombus surface area, was positively correlated with the erythrocyte component (r = 0. 362, p < 0. 0001). Moreover, multivariate logistic analysis demonstrated that erythrocyte-positive area in the thrombi, glucose levels on admission, larger vessel diameter (≥ 3. 5 mm), and pre-balloon dilation were independent predictors of the incidence of AVDE.
