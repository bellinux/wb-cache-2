60|$|The last promise, however, {{appeared}} {{fully to}} satisfy her. She kissed my hand, and I <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> tears falling on it.|$|E
6000|$|... "A joke? A bet?" [...] murmured Chauvelin hoarsely, for {{his throat}} now <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> and parched. [...] "What do you mean? Who are you, man? Speak, or I'll--" ...|$|E
60|$|The full {{meaning of}} her conduct came to her. She <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> all over; {{the palms of}} her hands were moist beneath the thin silk {{covering}} of her gloves.|$|E
60|$|They {{entered the}} shack, {{which for the}} first few minutes <b>felt</b> intolerably <b>hot.</b>|$|R
60|$|Slone <b>felt</b> the <b>hot,</b> sick rush {{of blood}} to his face, and humiliation and rage overtook him.|$|R
60|$|She nodded, {{and lifted}} her face; he <b>felt</b> her <b>hot</b> soft lips on his forehead, and went away a little comforted.|$|R
60|$|As to {{the giving}} the pig, {{that was a}} serious business; and David <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> and shy, and wanted {{to get it over}} as soon as {{possible}} without a fuss.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Hilda put down her work, and, declaring that she <b>felt</b> <b>hot,</b> threw open the French window and {{went out into the}} garden, whither, on some pretext or other, Philip {{followed}} her.|$|E
60|$|Marilla <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> anger surge up {{into her}} heart again. This child had taken and lost her treasured {{amethyst}} brooch and now sat there calmly reciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or repentance.|$|E
60|$|Maggie caught {{hold of her}} courage. She {{looked into}} his eyes unflinchingly, though she <b>felt</b> the <b>hot</b> colour rise into her cheeks.|$|R
60|$|Shefford <b>felt</b> a <b>hot</b> flush and had {{difficulty}} in controlling himself. From this single {{point of view}} the Mormon was impossible to reason with.|$|R
60|$|With {{the first}} retort Ken had <b>felt</b> a <b>hot</b> {{trembling}} go over him, and having yielded to his anger {{he did not}} care what happened.|$|R
60|$|Cyril soused {{his head}} with the cold water, and felt, as the captain had said, all the better for it, for {{the air in the}} little cabin was close and stuffy, and he had <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> and feverish before his wash.|$|E
60|$|When I partly {{recovered}} my faculties {{the pain}} was less intense, though my left arm, which was tied to my side, <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> and heavy, and the jolting motion convinced me that I lay {{in the bottom of}} a wagon.|$|E
60|$|He {{resolved}} to rise {{a little and}} get rid of his wig (which now <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> on his head), and so forth. He threw out a bag of ballast, and was astonished to find himself careering up through the air very rapidly.|$|E
6000|$|She was {{pressing}} {{his hand to}} her cheek that <b>felt</b> burning <b>hot.</b> And he thought: [...] "Forgive! Of course I forgive. That's not the point; the point is--" ...|$|R
60|$|The girl laughed softly, then laid {{a little}} hand upon his own. It <b>felt</b> strangely <b>hot,</b> and again {{her eyes were}} {{luminous}} {{in a manner that}} puzzled him.|$|R
60|$|He {{was still}} looking {{at her as she}} stood there before him meeting his gaze {{steadily}} and unafraid. He <b>felt</b> the <b>hot</b> passion of his love mounting higher and higher.|$|R
60|$|His {{answer was}} much such a grip as her poor little fingers had already received, but though they <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> and crushed {{all the way}} home, the {{sensation}} seemed to cause such throbs of joy, {{that she would not}} have been without it.|$|E
60|$|Poor girl! She {{felt that}} she was under scrutiny, and her eyes <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> and restless. She wished to run away and cry, but she dared not. She stayed, while Will began to tell her of his life and to ask {{questions}} about old friends.|$|E
60|$|Struggling to his feet, he lurched away. He went on walking, walking, {{looking for}} {{something}} for a drink. His brain <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> and inflamed for want of water. He stumbled on. Then {{he did not know}} anything. He went unconscious as he walked. Yet he stumbled on, his mouth open.|$|E
60|$|Lily marched bravely {{on for a}} long time, and saw at last a great {{smoke in}} the sky, smelt a spicy smell, and <b>felt</b> a <b>hot</b> wind blowing toward her.|$|R
60|$|Helena put {{her arms}} found him under his coat. She was cold. He <b>felt</b> a <b>hot</b> wave of joy suffuse him. Almost {{immediately}} she released him, and took off her hat.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Savine smiled, {{though her}} eyes glistened in the firelight as she laid a thin hand {{on one of}} Helen's, which <b>felt</b> burning <b>hot</b> as the fingers quivered within her grasp.|$|R
6000|$|... "Soit!" [...] was his response; and, {{gathering}} his {{flowers in}} his arms, he flashed out of classe; while I, consigning my work, scissors, thimble, and the neglected little box, to my desk, swept up-stairs. I don't {{know whether he}} <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> and angry, but I am free to confess that I did.|$|E
6000|$|Her [...] "you and I" [...] was too kindly, {{as though}} she was trying to put him at ease, {{as though she}} knew he couldn't {{possibly}} be at ease. With a horribly elaborate politeness, with a smile that <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> on his twitching cheeks, he murmured, [...] "Oh no. No, we---- No, I guess----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Freya <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> with indignation. She sat radiantly fair in the lamplight, her strong, well-shaped hands lying {{one on top}} of {{the other}} in her lap. [...] "Odious creature," [...] she thought. Her face {{coloured}} with sudden anger. [...] "You have scared my maid out of her senses," [...] she said aloud. [...] "What possessed you?" ...|$|E
60|$|He chided his own {{weakness}} inwardly, when he <b>felt</b> the <b>hot</b> tears surging to {{his eyes}} at thought of the unworthy use to which his little hoard {{was about to be}} put.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} <b>felt</b> it <b>hot</b> here, doctor, {{thanks to the}} care that they have taken in keeping the room cool. I hope now {{that there is no}} fear of my losing my arm?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay! 'tis unkind thus {{to grieve}} me," [...] {{she said with}} tender reproach as she <b>felt</b> the <b>hot</b> tears gather in her eyes. [...] "You know--as I do--that I am not my own {{mistress}} yet." ...|$|R
60|$|Though he {{surmised that}} no {{notion of what}} had brought him there had entered his companion's mind, Brooke <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> to the {{forehead}} now, for he was unpleasantly sensible that the girl was watching him. An explanation that might have served also suggested itself to him, but {{he felt that he}} could not add to his offences.|$|E
60|$|We {{came out}} upon this space at last into {{a light and}} heat that hit and pressed upon us. We traversed the exposed area painfully, and clambered up a slope among the scrub stems, {{and sat down at}} last panting in a high place beneath the shadow of a mass of twisted lava. Even in the shade the rock <b>felt</b> <b>hot.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{heard you}} had been ill," [...] she said softly, [...] "I was very sorry, believe me, but ... Oh! do you not think," [...] she added with sudden inexplicable pathos, whilst she <b>felt</b> <b>hot</b> tears rising to her eyes and causing her voice to quiver, [...] "do you not think that an {{interview}} between us now can only be painful to us both?" ...|$|E
60|$|After Psmith {{had gone}} to sleep, Mike lay for some time running over in his mind, as the best {{substitute}} for sleep, the various points of his innings that day. He <b>felt</b> very <b>hot</b> and uncomfortable.|$|R
60|$|Vaguely {{the older}} men {{wondered}} on whom the Augusta's choice had fallen, whilst my lord Hortensius Martius <b>felt</b> the <b>hot</b> blood rush to his cheeks at the hopes that had once more risen in his heart.|$|R
6000|$|Ethel blushed. [...] "You {{are very}} brave and generous, Frank," [...] said, bending her head, [...] "and I am captious and wicked." [...] He <b>felt</b> the <b>hot</b> tear {{blotting}} {{on his hand}} from his cousin's downcast eyes.|$|R
