40|$|ABSTRACT: One {{hundred and}} fifty fingers in 136 {{patients}} were treated by a two-stage flexor-tendon re-construction and followed {{for an average of}} 2. 4 years. A salvage procedure such as this was needed for most of these fingers since 81 per cent of the injuries were in Zone 2 and 45 per cent were Grade S in severity. Before reconstruction, the mean total active motion (all joints combined) for each finger was 102 degrees and <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>grip</b> strength was 20 per cent of normal. At final follow-up, the mean total active motion of these fingers was 176 degrees and <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>grip</b> strength was 79 per cent of normal.

40|$|Abstract Objectives: Palmaris longus (PL) is {{frequently}} {{used as a}} donor tendon in various wrist, hand and reconstructive surgery. It is believed that PL is a dispensable muscle that can be harvested without producing any func- tional loss at the donor hand. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> strength between normal subjects having the tendon and lacking it. Methods: Three hundred thirty three male subjects between 18 and 25 years of age were assessed for the presence of the PL tendon and grip strength was measured with a calibrated hydraulic hand dynamometer. Both dominant and non-dominant hands were divided into two groups according to the absence of PL tendon and grip strength was compared between groups. Results: <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>grip</b> strength in dominant extremities lacking PL was 45. 27 +/- 6. 21 kg and having PL was 45. 40 +/- 7. 07 kg (p= 0. 899). <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>grip</b> strength in non-dominant extremities lacking PL was 41. 04 +/- 6. 39 kg and having PL was 40. 79 +/- 6. 33 kg (p= 0. 782).

In this study we show that a coiled-coil protein with a GRIP domain occurs in the primitive eukaryote, Trypanosoma brucei, and that reporter proteins containing this domain {{can be used as a}} marker for the poorly characterized trans Golgi/trans-Golgi network of trypanosomatid parasites. <b>The</b> T brucei <b>GRIP</b> domain, when fused to the carboxyl terminus of the green fluorescent protein (GFP-Tb-GRIP), was efficiently localized to the Golgi apparatus of transfected COS cells.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Typically, the {{standard}} club head mass of a driver is 0. 2 kg approximately (White 2006). The golfing governing bodies do not stipulate driver club head mass. Theoretically, {{an increase in}} club head mass will {{lead to an increase}} in momentum transfer, but it is thought the increased mass leads to a reduction in club head velocity which is a more important determinant of how far the ball travels. The present study investigated the effect of increasing driver club head mass on club head velocity and total kinetic energy applied to the club at <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> by <b>means</b> of a computer simulation. METHOD: Kinematic data for one subject (25 yrs, 91. 3 kg, + 2 handicap) was collected using a 5 -camera set-up (Motion Analysis Corporation). The subject performed eight shots with his own driver. A LifeMOD computer model was constructed with 42 degrees-of-freedom. Kinematic data collected using MAC was used to drive the model inverse dynamics and forward dynamics simulations. Validation for this model was carried out for club head velocity (r= 0. 999), kinematics (r= 0. 983) and kinetics (for more details see, Kenny et al., 2008). DISCUSSION: The results show that for increased club head mass, there was an increase in club head velocity but no increase in kinetic energy applied by the hand on the club. Thus, these simulation results indicate that the increase in velocity was an equipment effect and not due to increased energy input from the subject. CONCLUSION: This study identified that increasing club head mass can lead to increased club head velocity without increased energy input at the point where <b>the</b> hand <b>grips</b> <b>the</b> club. Further investigation is needed to ascertain if this holds true in “real” subjects...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGrip force {{applied to}} an object held between the {{thumb and index}} finger is {{automatically}} and unconsciously adjusted upon perception of an external disturbance to the object. Typically, this adjustment occurs within approximately 100 ms. Here, we investigated the effect of anticipatory vibrotactile cues prior to a perturbative force, which the central nervous system may use for rapid grip re-stabilization. We asked participants to grip and hold an instrumented, actuated handle between the {{thumb and index finger}}. Under computer control, the handle could suddenly be pulled away from a static grip and could independently provide vibration to <b>the</b> <b>gripping</b> fingers. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> latency of corrective motor action was 139 ms. When vibrotactile stimulation was applied 50 ms before application of tractive force, the latency was reduced to 117 ms, whereas the mean latency of the conscious response to vibrotactile stimuli alone was 229 ms. This suggests that vibrotactile stimulation can influence reflex-like actions. We also examined the effects of anticipatory cues using a set of perturbative loads with different rising rates. As expected, facilitation of grip force adjustment was observed for moderate loads. In contrast, anticipatory cues had an insignificant effect on rapid loads that evoked an adjustment within 60 - 80 ms, which approaches the minimum latency of human <b>grip</b> adjustment.

Hand grip strength was significantly correlated with hand dominance, gender, occupation, height, and weight, but not body mass index. No significant differences in grip strength were noted with regard to race or level of income. Men were stronger than women in all age-groups, with a ratio of 1. 75 : 1. In both right- and left-hand dominant groups, the dominant hand was consistently stronger than the non-dominant side, with a ratio of 1. 12 : 1 in the right-hand dominant group and 1. 05 : 1 in the left-hand dominant group. <b>The</b> strongest hand <b>grip</b> strength in <b>the</b> right-hand dominant group occurred in the age-group of 25 to 34 years; in the left-hand dominant group it was in the age-group of 18 to 24 years. In western populations, <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> <b>grip</b> strength can be as much as 1. 5 times greater than in the Malaysian population. CONCLUSION: Data derived from western populations cannot be applied to a comparable Malaysian population. Gender, hand dominance, age, occupation, weight, and height must be considered when establishing normal values for grip strength...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> waved {{badminton}} <b>grip</b> {{is a type}} of grip {{that has}} foam strips in the center of <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> wrap so that after <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> is applied, there will be 'grooves' on <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> that can help increase friction and comfort when holding the racquet.The only slight disadvantage of waved grips is that is slightly heavier than flat <b>grips</b> due to <b>the</b> excess foam for the grooves.|$|R

40|$|Background In older people, hip {{fractures}} {{often lead}} to disability and death. We evaluated handgrip strength, an objective measure of physical function for bedridden patients, {{as a predictor of}} walking recovery in the year after fracture surgery. Methods This multicenter prospective cohort study included 504 patients aged 70 years and older, who were admitted to the hospital for hip fracture surgery and were formerly able to walk independently. A multidimensional geriatric evaluation that included a physical examination, Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Charlson Index, Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL), and grip strength was administered at the time of admission. Follow-ups were performed every three months for one year after surgery to assess functional status and survival. The walking recovery probability was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression models. Results The mean age of the participants was 85. 3 ± 5. 5 years, and 76. 1 % of the participants were women. <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> <b>grip</b> strength was greater in men (β: 6. 6 ± 0. 62, p< 0. 001) and was directly related to the SPMSQ results (p< 0. 001), BADL results (p< 0. 001), serum vitamin D levels (p= 0. 03), and time before surgery (p< 0. 001), whereas it was inversely related to age (p< 0. 001), GDS score (p< 0. 001), and Charlson Index (p< 0. 001). After adjusting for confounders, <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> strength was directly associated with the probability of both incident and persistent walking recovery (OR highest tertile vs. lowest tertile: 2. 84, C. I. 1. 76; 4. 59 and 2. 79, C. I. 1. 35; 5. 79, respectively). Conclusions In older patients with hip fractures, early grip strength evaluation might provide important prognostic information regarding the patient’s future functional trajectory...|$|R
