5000|$|An IPTV {{service is}} {{available}} to most Spanish customers via an extra <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> that connects to the yellow Ethernet port of the Livebox. The service allows for streaming of several free channels, while others require a paid subscription.|$|E
50|$|The channel's {{programming}} was transmitted over-the-air {{on television}} stations broadcasting on the UHF band. The <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> would receive the {{signal from the}} broadcast station and subscribers were required to tune their television sets to VHF channel 3 to view the broadcast (in a manner not unlike the transmission methods used for VCRs or modern cable set-top converters), a technology that was sometimes called a multipoint distribution system. Viewers {{that did not have}} a <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> saw a scrambled, flickering video feed and garbled or substituted audio. Some older black-and-white (and some color) television set models were able to receive a clear signal, due to a fluke with the older technology, but received garbled or no audio.|$|E
50|$|TV di Fastweb was a Cable Television and IPTV {{service from}} Fastweb. Its major {{features}} were a HDTV cable service, the Video On Demand services (a total of 17), and an advanced interactive service, all accessed via Videostation, the proprietary <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> Fastweb gave to its subscribers.|$|E
50|$|Although WSNS was {{constantly}} embroiled in lawsuits {{related to its}} late-night adult programming even for several years after the service shut down, nothing ever resulted from its final month of unauthorized back-catalog programming. One of the leftover ON Subscription Television <b>decoder</b> <b>boxes</b> was purchased at an annual ALS Mammouth Music Mart in Skokie in 1990 and was donated to the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago that same year.|$|R
50|$|CX was {{originally}} designed by CBS as a noise-reduction technology for vinyl LP records, {{similar to the}} earlier dbx system for dbx discs. CX required a special decoder connected to a stereo system, in order to fully reproduce the CX encoded sound on the LP. However, CX-encoded records could also be played without a decoder, with a resulting (claimed acceptable) amount of dynamic range compression. Relatively few hardware <b>decoder</b> <b>boxes</b> were sold.|$|R
5000|$|As {{digital cable}} and {{satellite}} became the norm, HTPC software became more dependent on external <b>decoder</b> <b>boxes,</b> and the subscription costs that came with them. For instance, MythTV is capable of capturing unencrypted HDTV streams, such as those broadcast over the air or on cable using a QAM tuner. However, most U.S. {{cable and satellite}} set-top boxes provide only encrypted HD streams for [...] "non-basic" [...] content, which can be decoded only by OpenCable-approved hardware or software. In September 2009, OEM restrictions were officially lifted for cableCARD devices, opening up the possibility for HTPC integration.|$|R
5000|$|SelecTV was an American {{subscription}} television service that {{was formed in}} 1976, and first began broadcasting in 1978; the service focused entirely on televising movies, and was shut down in 1991. The service originally allowed subscribers to pay only for programs [...] "selected" [...] during the month, with the first several minutes free (the <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> included a phone hook-up to transmit information back to the billing office); it later switched to a flat fee.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other over-the-air {{subscription}} television services, SuperTV maintained a part-time schedule throughout its entire existence, never {{switching to a}} 24-hour schedule; it broadcast Monday through Fridays from 7:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. and from 3:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. on weekends. Subscribers received a 12x12-inch brown <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> and a dedicated UHF antenna, which was installed atop a roof or on a balcony and aimed toward the station's transmitter. When attached to a television, the box would unencrypt the SuperTV programming. In July 1982, SuperTV expanded into the Baltimore market, affiliating with independent station WNUV (channel 54, also a CW affiliate).|$|E
50|$|The FTTP {{system uses}} an Alcatel-Lucent 7340 ISAM shelf, which is mostly used {{in areas such}} as new neighborhoods or {{large-scale}} developments where fiber can be run to the household, removing the distance limitations of copper. The 7340 then connects to a Primary Flexibility Point, which distributes service to homes in the neighborhood, via a dual strand fiber, which is then split into 32 customer fiber pairs. In FTTP systems, the fiber pairs are typically led into a customer's residence at the network interface device. In FTTD (fiber to the desk) systems, the fiber can continue to an equipment room or garage, then to a <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> or residential gateway, then to the customer's TV, computer, and phone lines.|$|E
50|$|The Detroit market also faced {{challenges}} from its {{close proximity to}} Canada, which had no subscription television services. Canadians who dabbled in electronics soon learned how to manufacture their own <b>decoder</b> <b>boxes</b> and sold them for a flat fee of $75, allowing unlimited access to ONTV's programming. While WXON tried several times to re-scramble the signal - particularly before showings of big-name films such as The Wiz and Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope - their efforts ultimately failed, as the boxes easily {{found their way into}} the Detroit market from across the Canada-United States border in nearby Windsor, Ontario (hobbyists on the American side made and sold boxes as well, charging up to $150).|$|R
50|$|There are {{two ways}} {{providers}} try to make this easier for consumers. The first, accomplished through PSIP, is where program and channel information is broadcast along with the video, allowing the consumer's <b>decoder</b> (set-top <b>box</b> or display) to automatically identify the many channels and subchannels.|$|R
50|$|Technically, {{when the}} {{customer}} selects the movie, a point-to-point unicast connection {{is set up}} between the customer's <b>decoder</b> (set-top <b>box</b> or PC) and the delivering streaming server. The signalling for the trick play functionality (pause, slow-motion, wind/rewind etc.) is assured by RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol).|$|R
50|$|In 1980, {{the group}} sold WKID to Oak Industries, a cable {{television}} equipment manufacturer {{and owner of}} ONTV, a subscription television service that was carried during the evening hours, which could only be viewed for a monthly fee, and required a set-top <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> and outdoor antenna for adequate reception. The station's programming during this period included business news programming from the Financial News Network during the daytime hours and a horse racing show hosted by Bob Savage in the early evening. The ONTV subscription service programming commenced at 6 p.m. (EST) Monday through Friday and at 10 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. With the expansion of cable television in the Miami area, ONTV {{proved to be an}} ill-fated venture and was dropped by WKID-TV in 1985.|$|E
5000|$|The Zenith SSAVI (sync {{suppression}} {{and video}} inversion) {{was used as}} the decode the signal, however it had no external controls other than a small chrome button atop the <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> to select between standard television signals or SuperTV. In a then-pioneering effort at thwarting piracy, the station could address each box individually to authorize decoding of programs, including one-time pay-per-view broadcasts or adult program options. In addition, to defeat simple home-engineer descrambling techniques, video inversion was done selectively, often when the video frame was light overall, causing the scrambled picture to retain in a darker tint than the elevated sync pulses. In certain cases, video was inverted on alternate frames. The audio transmitted on the standard audio channel was a [...] "barker" [...] announcement, informing would-be customers that SuperTV was a scrambled service and required a subscription to view its content.|$|E
50|$|KYKX {{can trace}} its roots back to Longview's first FM station, KLTI-FM, which {{went on the}} air at 105.9 MHz on October 27, 1948. KLTI-FM was founded and {{operated}} by R.G. LeTourneau of the LeTourneau Institute and LeTourneau Industries, and was co-operated with KLTI(AM) 1280 kHz. KLTI-FM ran an easy listening and classical music format, and provided functional music to local businesses. Functional music on FM was a predecessor of Muzak, providing background music to businesses and operated via a <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> that would receive a tone from the station that muted the station's commercials. KLTI(AM) and KLTI-FM transmitted from a tower on Signal Hill in south Longview, across from LeTourneau Industries. The tower, a south Longview landmark because of its unique Eiffelized style, still stands today and is used by low power television station KLGV-LP. KLTI-FM went off the air sometime in 1955 or 1956.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, WXON {{began to}} carry {{subscription}} television programming provided by ONTV, which aired daily after 8 p.m. The ONTV broadcasts were encrypted, requiring a rented set-top box to decode WXON's signal during hours when the station ran ONTV programming; {{the service was}} not cheap at $22.50 a month (equivalent to over $70 in 2017 adjusted for inflation). Many people, especially those living across the river in Windsor, Ontario, who figured out the technological simplicities in how WXON encrypted ONTV programming built their own <b>decoder</b> <b>boxes</b> and watched the service for free illegally. The network carried uncut movies, concerts and local sporting events. However, since many games began before 8 in the evening, fans missed the start of many contests. In one famous incident, the Detroit Red Wings racked up a 5-0 lead {{in a game against}} the Calgary Flames before ONTV began its coverage.|$|R
50|$|On January 17, 1984, WLS-TV {{launched}} Tele1st, an ABC-owned overnight {{subscription television}} service that carried {{a mix of}} films and lifestyle programs for four hours per night {{six days a week}} after the station's sign-off at 2:00 a.m.; the service was similar in format to competitor ONTV (which was carried locally on WSNS-TV, channel 44) and other over-the-air pay services that existed during the early and mid-1980s. Tele1st was created with the concept of allowing users to record programming for later viewing; therefore, its <b>decoder</b> <b>boxes</b> were designed to unencrypt the signal only {{with the aid of a}} VCR. Scrambling codes that were sent to the box and relayed to the VCR were changed on a monthly basis, requiring subscribers to record additional footage airing immediately before and after that night's schedule to retrieve codes to play back the recorded programs properly; this resulted in any recordings being viewable only during that calendar month. Tele1st was deemed a failure, attributing only 4,000 subscribers at its peak, and ceased operations on June 30, 1984.|$|R
50|$|The DBox is a DVB {{satellite}} and cable digital television integrated receiver <b>decoder</b> (set-top <b>box).</b> They were distributed widely {{for use with}} Pay television channels. The DBox-1 was the first DVB-capable receiver to be produced and distributed in large quantity. It was commissioned by the Kirch group's DF1, an early German provider of digital television that later merged with Premiere. The hardware was developed and produced by Nokia though later also produced by Philips and Sagem under license.|$|R
50|$|SelecTV was {{transmitted}} via scrambled signal {{from a local}} UHF television station. A <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> was required to unscramble the signal in order to view its programming. SelecTV was available {{in at least three}} markets: in Milwaukee on WCGV (channel 24, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate), in Los Angeles on KWHY-TV (channel 22, now a MundoMax affiliate), and in Philadelphia on WWSG (channel 57, now CW owned-and-operated station WPSG). On WWSG, the service utilized the gated-pulse scrambling technique for the video - and for the audio using technology that would later be used to enable multichannel television sound, moving the audio to a different subcarrier, freeing the standard audio channel for use as a barker channel (which was used for sales promotions). In 1984, New Jersey-based Wometco Home Theater began offering SelecTV on its affiliated television stations after the network ceased programming; however, the affiliation with SelecTV would not last long, as within a year, WHT ceased operations. This occurred following a massive financial collapse, its own {{as a result of a}} majority of their subscribers defecting to cable television services which offered more channels, including pay television services such as HBO and Showtime.|$|E
50|$|Videocipher II was {{the first}} {{consumer}} TVRO scrambling system. It began testing in 1985 on HBO satellite transponders on Satcom 3R and Galaxy 1 and entered full use in January 1986 by HBO and sister channel Cinemax, and within two years was used {{by a majority of}} major cable television programmers. However, lapses in its security enabled some pirate decryption, modifying the descrambler to receive free programming. Beginning in 1991, programmers began to phase out the VCII system in favor of the highly secure Videocipher II Plus (RS) system. The system was fully phased out in 1993. Originally sold as a stand-alone <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> that consisted of a fully electronic decoder and descrambler module, other satellite system manufacturers began to manufacturer their receivers with the GI descrambler module installed. This VCII system digitally encrypts stereo audio using the DES encryption scheme and scrambles video by inverting the video polarity and moving color information to a nonstandard area frequency. It is noteworthy that the Videocipher II Plus design did not alter the video scrambling scheme (only the audio encryption was improved). As such, a Videocipher II decoder is still capable of decoding the video portion of a Videocipher II Plus encrypted stream. In the late eighties and early nineties, VideoCipher II modules that had been pirated, began to receive constant Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E
5000|$|The station first {{signed on}} the air on March 24, 1980, under the {{ownership}} of B&F Broadcasting from the former North 27th Street facilities of then-CBS affiliate WITI (channel 6), which had {{moved to a new}} facility in Brown Deer two years earlier in 1978. At the time, it operated as an independent station and ran religious programs, older movies, cartoons and drama series during the day, along with select CBS and NBC programs that WITI and WTMJ-TV (channel 4) declined to air (such as the 1983 Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour and CBS Late Night). It also produced a two-hour local afternoon talk program called Tempo 24, which aired from 1980 to 1981. At night, the station ran programming from subscription television service SelecTV, which required a <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> and a monthly subscription to view; SelecTV ran mostly first-run feature films, although Friday evenings outside of FCC-designated safe harbor hours consisted of adult programming from The Playboy Channel. WCGV dropped SelecTV in 1984 once Warner Cable launched its Milwaukee area operations and brought traditional premium cable networks (such as HBO and Showtime) to the area, and eventually became a more serious contender against now-sister station WVTV (channel 18) for the title of the market's leading independent station. The station was branded simply as [...] "TV-24". By then, the station had been acquired by Arlington Broadcasting, which also owned WTTO in Birmingham, WQTV (now WBPX-TV) in Boston and KNXV-TV in Phoenix; the latter two stations were later sold off.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the late}} 1970s through the mid-1980s, {{independent}} stations in several U.S. cities, {{particularly those that}} had yet to receive a cable franchise, carried a form of a network affiliation through subscription television networks (such as ONTV, Spectrum and SelecTV); these services - which were formatted very similarly to their pay cable counterparts - ran sports, uncut and commercial-free movies (both mainstream and pornographic, broadcasts of the latter often created legal issues that were eventually largely cleared up due to an FCC regulation that legally allowed the broadcast of programs featuring content {{that would otherwise be}} deemed indecent when broadcast [...] "in the clear" [...] if the encrypted signal was not visible or audible to nonsubscribers), and on some services, television specials. Independents usually ran the services during the evening and overnight hours in lieu of running movies and other programs acquired off the syndication market by the station, although a few eventually began to carry these services for most of the broadcast day. The services required the use of <b>decoder</b> <b>boxes</b> to access the service's programming (some of which were fairly easy to unencrypt due to the transmission methods stations used to scramble the signal during the service's broadcast hours); some required the payment of an additional one-time fee to receive events and adult films. As cities added cable franchises, thus allowing people to subscribe to conventional premium television networks like HBO and Showtime, nearly all of the over-the-air subscription services had shuttered operations {{by the end of the}} 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|As an independent, WHCT's {{schedule}} {{consisted of}} cartoons, movies, off-network sitcoms and dramas, sports (including New York Mets baseball games), public affairs programming, and religious shows. However, it never really thrived, {{even with the}} addition of all-channel tuning. Beginning in 1962, the station ran a subscription television service from 7:00 p.m. to midnight, with first-run movies and sports events from Madison Square Garden. A decade before the 1972 launch of pay cable network HBO, WHCT's programming was an experiment between RKO and Zenith, who provided the [...] "Phonevision" [...] descrambler boxes. WHCT could be seen by all viewers with a UHF tuner and antenna during regular broadcast hours, but viewers needed a <b>decoder</b> <b>box</b> in order to view the signal during the subscription television block. The first pay-TV movie was Sunrise At Campobello, starring Ralph Bellamy and Greer Garson. The subscription television service could only broadcast in black and white, despite {{the fact that many of}} the movies shown were made in color. It was deemed a failure, and RKO dropped it early in 1968. By then, the station had slashed its operating hours, signing on at 1 p.m. in the afternoon and signing off late at night. Charles Osgood, now the host of CBS Sunday Morning, was general manager of the station. By 1970, the station was signing on at 10 a.m. and had a moderate amount of then-strong programming, including Gilligan's Island, The Dick Van Dyke Show, McHale's Navy, Mister Ed, Bugs Bunny, The Fugitive, The Untouchables and What's My Line?, as well as the RKO film library. They also ran Romper Room, which was produced at then-sister station WOR-TV.|$|E
40|$|Broadcast {{encryption}} is {{the problem}} of a sending an encrypted message to a large user base such that the message can only be decrypted by a dynamically changing privileged subset. The study of broadcast encryption has become more and more important with the ever-increasing concern about copyright issues and the increasing interest in secure multicasting (over cable television and the Internet). We discuss the early broadcast-encryption results of Fiat and Naor [3], presenting several broadcast-encryption schemes from that paper. Next, we discuss Naor, Naor, and Lotspiech’s [6] subset-cover model, an abstract framework for broadcast-encryption schemes. We then discuss instances of the subset-cover model. This is followed by discussion of a method of Halevy and Shamir [4] that improves upon [6]’s best example of a subset-cover scheme. We finish with a discussion of traitor tracing — the problem of, given an illegal <b>decoder</b> <b>box,</b> punishing the users who contributed keys to it. In particular, we focus on traitor-tracing algorithms for (some) subset-cover schemes. ...|$|E
