5|$|The Mountaineers typical consist (at first) {{was five}} cars: a baggage-dormitory, two coaches, a grill diner and a 10-roomette 6-bedroom (10-6) {{sleeping}} car. When available, {{one of the}} coaches was a <b>dome</b> <b>car.</b> Starting in January 1977 Amtrak ran a consist of three new Amfleet cars, typically two coaches and a cafe.|$|E
5|$|The Santa Fe {{introduced}} the El Capitan in 1938. The train {{ran on the}} Santa Fe's main line between Chicago and Los Angeles. Unusually for streamliners of the period, the El Capitan carried coaches only, and had no sleeping cars. Passengers flocked to the new train, and the Santa Fe added cars to meet the demand. The train grew from five cars in 1938 to fourteen in 1952. Sometimes demand was high enough to justify running a second instance ("section") of the train on the same day. The Santa Fe sought a solution to increase {{the capacity of the}} train without lengthening it further. Two popular innovations by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad (CB) suggested a solution. First, in 1945, the CB {{introduced the}} first <b>dome</b> <b>car,</b> in which passengers rode on a second level high above the tracks, affording better views. Second, in 1950, it placed bilevel rail cars in commuter service in the Chicago area. Taken together, these innovations suggested a new possibility: a long-distance bilevel coach, with greater capacity than single-level cars, and the panoramic views of a dome.|$|E

Southern Pacific Railroad built its own <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> in its Sacramento, California, shops. In the 1990s Colorado Railcar began producing <b>dome</b> <b>cars.</b> Generally, {{seats in the}} dome were considered [...] "non-revenue" [...] like lounge <b>car</b> seats. When <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> operate today in excursion trains, the dome seats often command a premium fare.|$|R
5000|$|New {{rolling stock}} {{introduced}} starting in 1962 included <b>dome</b> <b>cars,</b> one per train, used {{only on the}} Rheingold and Rheinpfeil (Rhine Arrow). In Europe, the use of <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> was unique to these two trains. After the Rheinpfeil was integrated into the Bundesbahn's new Intercity network in 1971, the TEE Erasmus began using the displaced <b>dome</b> <b>cars,</b> along with the Rheingold. [...] The <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> were withdrawn on 30 May 1976.|$|R

25|$|The {{basic design}} of a {{passenger}} car was standardized by 1870. By 1900 the main car types were: baggage, coach, combine, diner, <b>dome</b> <b>car,</b> lounge, observation, private, Pullman, railroad post office (RPO) and sleeper.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1980s dome {{cars have}} become rare since Amtrak {{introduced}} Superliner bi-level passenger {{cars that are}} 16 feet tall over {{the length of the}} car (but at a stretch the Superliner lounge car could be considered a <b>dome</b> <b>car).</b> Dome cars are very popular on tourist railways and private charter rail services. Some railroad museums have preserved several dome cars. These cars are very popular with visitors who often remember the spectacular rides they had in these cars.|$|E

2500|$|The Strata-Domes were a {{fleet of}} five {{streamlined}} <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> operated by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad ("B"). The term referred both {{to a pair of}} <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> constructed by Pullman-Standard and three Budd Company domes the B acquired from the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway ("C"). They were the first <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> operated in the Eastern United States, following on the success of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad's [...] "Vista-Domes" [...] in the west. The cars entered service in 1949 and were all out of regular service by 1981. Several have been preserved.|$|R

25|$|A <b>dome</b> <b>car</b> {{is a type}} of railway {{passenger}} car that has a glass dome {{on the top of the}} car where passengers can ride and see in all directions around the train. It also can include features of a coach, lounge car, dining car, sleeping car or observation. Beginning in 1945, dome cars were primarily used in the United States and Canada, though a small number were constructed in Europe for Trans Europ Express service, and similar panorama cars are in service on Alpine tourist railways like the Bernina Express.|$|E
25|$|The Super Domes {{were not}} a {{complete}} success in Milwaukee Road service. The heavy cars gave a rough ride, and {{the seats in the}} dome area gave an inferior view because they lay too low compared to the dome's supporting bulkheads. Still, the fame of having the first full-length <b>dome</b> <b>car</b> was good publicity for the railroad. After the discontinuance of the Olympian Hiawatha in 1961 Super Domes were seen on some of the services the Milwaukee Road operated with the Union Pacific, including the City of Denver. In 1964 the Milwaukee Road sold six of the domes to the Canadian National Railway, along with the sleeper-lounge Skytop Lounges. The remaining four domes continued on the Twin Cities Hiawatha.|$|E
25|$|Soon after Silver Dome entered service, {{railroad}} {{managers and}} passenger train executives met {{to discuss the}} merits of the <b>dome</b> <b>car</b> design. In the United States, domes could only be readily used on railroads west of the Mississippi, due to lower clearances in tunnels in the eastern USA. (In Canada, Canadian Pacific would run its domes from coast to coast.) The managers also noted that the passenger carrying space was regarded as non-revenue space because the managers believed that passengers would not want to spend their entire trip in the domes. These factors and the added costs of car construction in adding stairs, two levels of car floors and air conditioning increased the costs to railroads that chose to operate dome cars.|$|E

50|$|Deliveries of the {{new cars}} were {{essentially}} completed by 1954, but CNR waited until 24 April 1955 to introduce its new transcontinental flagship Super Continental to replace its former flagship, the Continental Limited. Not coincidentally, {{this was the same}} date that competitor Canadian Pacific Railway introduced its new streamlined transcontinental train The Canadian. Despite the new and refurbished equipment and a new black-and-green, yellow-trim paint scheme, the Super Continental's mixture of equipment paled in comparison to CPR's all stainless-steel consist, produced for them by the Budd Company. An additional important distinction was that The Canadian featured scenic <b>dome</b> <b>cars,</b> which the Super Continental did not use. CN chose not to purchase <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> for reasons of economy, although it has also been claimed that <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> might interfere with the electrified catenary used in Montreal's Central Station by commuter trains of the former Canadian Northern raillines. In 1964, CN purchased used <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> that came from United States to use on the portion of the route between Edmonton and Vancouver from the Milwaukee Road.|$|R

For the final run of the old Capitol Limited on April 29, 1971, the B ran the entire trainset from Baltimore's Camden Station, including the <b>dome</b> <b>car.</b> The B printed special commemorative tickets and returned its bottled Deer Park spring water and B's signature, [...] "all-you-can-eat" [...] giant salad bowls to the final run's dining car, some of the Capitol Limited 's amenities from more prosperous times. A 31-year veteran dining car waiter on the last run of the Capitol Limited recalled to a Baltimore Sun reporter that, [...] "all the vegetables we served were freshly cooked on board—no frozen or canned food at all." ...|$|E

Amtrak has also operated the car in fall foliage service on the New York-Montreal [...] "Adirondack" [...] and on several of its Chicago-based regional trains. In the summertime, <b>dome</b> <b>car</b> #10031 is used on the single level Pacific Surfliner trainset. Another <b>dome</b> <b>car</b> Amtrak used (no longer in service) was on the Capitol Limited, possibly removed when the train switched to Superliner I & II cars.|$|E

5000|$|On April 24, 1955, {{the same}} day that the CPR {{introduced}} its transcontinental train The Canadian, CNR introduced its own new transcontinental passenger train, the Super Continental, which used new streamlined rolling stock. However, the Super Continental was never considered as glamorous as the Canadian. For example, it did not include <b>dome</b> <b>cars.</b> <b>Dome</b> <b>cars</b> would be added in the early 1960s with the purchase of six former Milwaukee Road [...] "Super Domes". They were used on the Super Continental in the summer tourist season.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{the design}} of a <b>dome</b> <b>car</b> can be likened to a cupola caboose, the dome car's {{development}} is not directly related. The earliest documented predecessor of the <b>dome</b> <b>car</b> was first developed in the 1880s; known at the time as the [...] "birdcage car", it was used on an 1882 sightseeing tour on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. In 1891, T. J. McBride received a patent for a car design called an [...] "observation-sleeper"; illustrations of the design in Scientific American at the time showed a car with three observation domes. Canadian Pacific Railway used [...] "tourist cars" [...] with raised, glass-sided viewing cupolas on their trains through the Canadian Rocky Mountains in the 1920s.|$|E

25|$|As {{railroad}} passenger ridership {{declined in}} the late 1950s, some railroads retired <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> due to the maintenance costs. Other railroads that had not purchased <b>dome</b> <b>cars</b> new bought them second hand. Illinois Central purchased several cars from Missouri Pacific and Canadian National bought several cars from Milwaukee Road, for example. Because of their enormous usage of sealed glass, the cooling of the cars required massive air conditioning capacity. Maintenance and repair of these cars was costly. Breakdown of the air conditioning system on the road, even in winter, could render a car unusable.|$|R
