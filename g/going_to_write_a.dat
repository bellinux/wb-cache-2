25|$|As {{the wedding}} approached, R.A. Kartini's {{attitude}} towards Javanese traditional customs began to change. She became more tolerant. She {{began to feel}} that her marriage would bring good fortune for her ambition to develop a school for native women. In her letters, she mentioned {{that not only did}} her esteemed husband support her desire to develop the woodcarving industry in Jepara and the school for native women, but she also mentioned that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> book. Sadly, this ambition was unrealized {{as a result of her}} premature death in 1904 at the age of only 25.|$|E

This structure, which Collins had previously used in her series The Underland Chronicles, came from Collins's playwriting background.

500|$|Flannery {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} {{not only by}} his own political viewpoints and life experiences, {{but also by the}} real-life history of his home city of Newcastle during the 1960s and 1970s. Characters such as Austin Donohue and John Edwards were directly based on the real-life scandals of T. Dan Smith and John Poulson, who built cheap high-rise housing projects in Newcastle that they knew to be of low quality. Flannery contacted Smith and explained that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> play based on the events of the scandal, to which Smith replied, [...] "There is a play here of Shakespearean proportions." ...|$|E

[...] Rosenblum recalled that Allen [...] "had no hesitation about trimming away much of the first twenty minutes {{in order to establish}} Keaton more quickly." [...] According to Allen, [...] "I didn't sit down with Marshall Brickman and say, 'We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> picture about a relationship.'

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} Waugh's intention {{to attempt a}} novel appears in a letter dated May 1924, to his schoolfriend Dudley Carew. Waugh writes: [...] "Quite soon I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> little book. It {{is going to be}} called The Temple at Thatch and will be all about magic and madness". This writing project may have been a reaction to Waugh's immediate circumstances; he was in the last weeks of his Oxford career, contemplating failure in his examinations and irritated by {{the fact that most of}} his contemporaries appeared to be on the verge of brilliant careers. On [...] 22 June 1924 he spent time working out the plot, a continuation of the supernatural theme explored in [...] "Unacademic Exercise". The basic premise was an undergraduate inheriting a country house of which nothing was left except an 18th-century folly, where he set up house and practised black magic.|$|E

Prior to filming the episode, Schrempf's acting skills had been limited to appearances on the American comedy series Married... with Children and the German soap opera Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten. Schur said of his performance, [...] "For a guy who literally never acted before in his life, he was really funny." [...] Aziz Ansari joked about the performance, [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> spin-off for him called That's So Detlef, so look forward to that." [...] "Telethon" [...] also featured guest appearances by several actors who had appeared in previous episodes, including Mo Collins as Pawnee Today television host Joan Callamezzo and Jay Jackson as Pawnee television news reporter Perd Hapley.

500|$|Following {{the oral}} argument, the Chief Justice {{assigned}} Justice John Paul Stevens {{to write the}} majority opinion and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. asked Justice Thurgood Marshall to write the minority or dissenting opinion, based on the initial count of the justices' views. [...] Since Justice Potter Stewart {{did not participate in}} the case, it would take a 5-3 vote to overturn the decision of the Circuit Court. [...] Stevens circulated a memorandum stating that his decision would be to invalidate the tax - Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice William Rehnquist immediately stated they would join his opinion. [...] Justice Byron White stated that he would wait and see what the dissent said, and then indicated he would join the dissent in part. [...] It also appeared that Justice Harry Blackmun was also <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> separate dissent, but he also stated that he would wait to see Marshall's opinion. [...] At this point, the tribe had the votes to win on a 4-4 vote, but the Court was close to being adjourned for the summer recess. [...] On July 3, 1981, the Court notified the parties to reargue the case on November 4, 1981.|$|E
500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song', inspiration hits me always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or just before I go to bed. An idea will suddenly come to my mind, and sometimes I manage to turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get something real out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E

2500|$|Grinnell's {{leadership}} was controversial. He appeared {{to many of}} the internees to be too authoritative in ruling them and too acquiescent to the Japanese, banning community dances, building a recreational shack for the Japanese guards, and setting up an internee court and jail for offenders.

2500|$|Looking back on {{this period}} (in 1926), Milne {{observed}} that when he told his agent that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> detective story, {{he was told that}} what the country wanted from a [...] "Punch humorist" [...] was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that [...] "the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory con amore as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others." ...|$|E

It's always whether I'm just overwhelmed with some emotion. Whether it be I'm happy, I'm sad, I've fallen in love, I've fallen out of love. I'm lonely, I'm scared. Whatever it be that day. If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come out. For me, I don't really go back. I probably should. I have a bajillion pieces of songs.

2500|$|After 1810, Southey {{began to}} change from Jacobin {{political}} feelings to support of the establishment and monarchies. While writing the epic, his feelings were shaped {{by the events of}} Napoleon's conquests in Europe and his invasion of Spain. Napoleon's actions provoked Southey to disapprove of one nation controlling another nation. These changing beliefs helped to shape Roderick, which involved the Moorish invasion of Spain. The poem was completed 14 July 1814. During this time, Southey was made a member of the Royal Spanish Academy. It was put into print in August and published in November. It was the last long poem that Southey would write. When Southey was told that Francis Jeffrey was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> bad review of the poem, he claimed, [...] "Jeffrey can no more stand in my way to fame than Tom Thumb could stand in my way in the street. I consider him a public nuisance and shall deal with him accordingly." [...] The poem had a second and third edition published in 1815. A fourth edition was published in 1816. The printed poem also included a series of notes, a common feature to his long poems, which drew complaints from reviewers.|$|E
2500|$|According to Yorke, {{many of his}} {{lyrics are}} {{motivated}} by anger, expressing his political and environmental concerns, and written as [...] "a constant response to doublethink". The lyrics of the 2003 Radiohead album Hail to the Thief dealt with what he called [...] "the general sense of ignorance and intolerance and panic and stupidity" [...] following the 2000 election of US President George W. Bush and the unfolding War on Terror. Yorke wrote his 2006 solo single [...] "Harrowdown Hill" [...] about David Kelly, a whistleblower who allegedly committed suicide after telling a reporter that the British government had falsely identified weapons of mass destructions in Iraq. In a 2008 television performance of [...] "House of Cards", Yorke dedicated the chorus lyric, [...] "denial, denial", to Bush for rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty to reduce greenhouse gases. Despite his political concerns, in a November 2015 interview with the activist and writer George Monbiot, he said: [...] "In the 60s, you could write songs that were like calls to arms, and it would work. It’s much harder to do that now ... If I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> protest song about climate change in 2015, it would be shit.

6000|$|I {{glanced at}} the Altrurian, sitting {{attentive}} and silent, and a sudden misgiving crossed my mind concerning him. Was he really a man, a human entity, a personality like ourselves, or was he merely a sort of spiritual solvent, sent for the moment to precipitate whatever sincerity there was in us, and show us what the truth was concerning our relations to one another? It was a fantastic conception, but I thought it was one that I might employ {{in some sort of}} purely romantic design, and I was professionally grateful for it.
