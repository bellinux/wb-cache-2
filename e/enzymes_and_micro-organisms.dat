40|$|A new primary {{model has}} been developed, using Gaussian {{distributed}} populations and Eyrings rate constant for the transition state, to describe inactivation kinetics of <b>enzymes</b> <b>and</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> subjected to heat and chemical treatment. The inactivation of both <b>enzymes</b> <b>and</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> could {{be associated with the}} irreversible transition to an inactivated state, as suggested by the Lumry-Eyring model for protein denaturation and enzyme inactivation. The characteristic inactivation model parameters, standard activation enthalpy and entropy, are directly related to the reference temperature and Z-value commonly used for kinetic analysis in food microbiology. An essential feature of the kinetic model is that its parameters, and hence the transition temperature, are treated as stochastic variables. The characteristic line shape of the primary model is the log-normal distribution. The performance of the model was validated, using literature data for enzyme and microbial inactivation over a wide range of temperature and pH. </p...|$|E

Additional juice may be extracted from the remaining pulp by hot water. The juice is homogenized, slightly acidified to prevent gelling and improve the flavor, then treated with pectinase or other enzymes {{to break down the}} pectin. Most of the off-flavor agents are then removed with ion-exchange resins, such as sulfonated polystyrene-divinylbenzene copolymer or polyacrylic acid. Alternatively, the off-flavors can be adsorbed by agents like charcoal or bentonite, which are removed by filtration; or precipitated with gelatin or other gelling agents. Most of the remaining sulfurous volatiles are then removed by low-pressure evaporation.

The {{existence of this}} carbohydrate causes serious crystallization difficulties in the dairy industry, in addition to environmental problems. Moreover, {{it has to be}} taken into consideration that a 70 % of the population is lactose intolerant. The present document shows the results of a study carried out {{in order to determine the}} current condition of the lactose hydrolysis process to produce free-lactose milk. The study will base on the process variables and the optimal conditions of the enzymatic hydrolysis, always taking into account the extent of reaction. The reaction presents inhibition by product which should have to be minimized in order to reach an efficiency of the process higher than an 80 %. Moreover, it will be determined economic and social factors involved in the selection of this kind of process, that make more suitable the use of soluble enzyme instead of the immobilized one. On the other hand, a literature search has been done to study the different thermal treatments applicable to raw milk in order to deactivate the soluble enzyme that causes the lactose hydrolysis.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{doctoral}} dissertation was to improve the production of methane by mechanical and enzymatic pretreatments of organic substrates. For anaerobic digestion of different substrates and determination of biomethane potential, Automatic Methane Potential Test System (AMPTS II) device was used. AMPTS II is an analytical laboratory scale device used in measurements of ultra low speed production of biomethane produced during the anaerobic digestion of biodegradable substrates. Although biogas yields of biogas plants arelimited to the specific substrates, methane yields are difficult to generalize from the collected data in published literature due to different modifications of substrates, including particle size reduction or chemical pretreatment all affecting their properties and energy recovery. Therefore, for biogas plant decision making the data need {{to be derived from}} inoculum of concrete biogas plant and substrates in such a condition as to be dosed in anaerobic reactors on real industrial scale. By upgrading commercial system AMPTS II from 0. 5 liters to 5 liters, a pilot scale device was developed and validated for such real-scale experiments mirroring anaerobic reactors at the biogas plant. On 5 liter pilot scale biomethane yield of 24 substrates in solid or liquid form was assessed and compared with existing published data. By adding a variety of additives in the form of <b>enzymes</b> <b>and</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> in the process of anaerobic digestion, the impact on the production of methane and enhancement of the production of methane was evaluated. A combination of different substrates from paper mill sludge from Kraft process, a dehydrated paper mill sludge, bio-waste and lignocellulosic substrate an optimization of methane production in batch mode was conducted. The effects of the addition of hydrolytic enzymes on the production of methane from dehydrated paper mill sludge from Paloma was further tested in semi - continuous experiments. Significant improvements were detected. In the next following semi - continuous experiments an ultrasonic pre-treatment of sludge from the treatment plant in combination with the addition of hydrolytic enzymes was tested. In addition, the operation of the biogas plant Vučja vas was monitored for a period of 5 months during the substrate fluctuation period. Using T- RFLP technique the effects of enzyme and incubation time on the structure of bacterial and archeae consortium were assessed.

40|$|An {{industrial}} soil {{collected from}} a recycling factory was contaminated by DEHP and spilled diesel. The soils {{were divided into}} two batches for off-site ex situ bioremediation by SMC. This industrial soil was contaminated with 5. 4 - 6. 9 g/kg total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), 14. 5 [...] 19. 0 g/kg oil and grease and 95 - 99 mg/kg DEHP. The removal by 3 % SMC amendment applied twice accounted for 56 - 64 %, 31 [...] 33 % and 51 [...] 54 % disappearance of the TPH, oil and grease and DEHP contaminants, respectively. Beside chemical analysis, six bacteria and six fungi were inoculated into the sterilized soil samples for ecotoxicity tests. The original soil samples containing residual oil and DEHP contents were found to be more toxic than the SMC-treated soil. Thus SMC simultaneously degrades organic pollutants and reduces toxicity in less than a month. An underground water sample contaminated with dibutyl phthalate (DBP, 127. 5 +/- 20. 7 mu 1 / 1) and DEHP (67. 0 +/- 7. 7 mu 1 / 1) was tested. One percent SMC could remove 94. 2 +/- 3. 6 % and 100 % for DBP and DEHP, respectively, within 1 h at room temperature. DBP and DEHP were degraded completely by SMCE except 0. 2 % SMCE for DBP after 24 -h treatment. SMC had higher removal efficiencies than SMCE, because SMC had an integrated system of biosorption and biodegradation to remove DBP and DEHP. The sorption kinetics of DBP and DEHP by SMC could be described by the Freundlich monolayer model. Even after eight cycles of the sorption-desorption of DEHP SMC maintained the 100 % removal efficiency. Thus SMC is a good biosorbent for DEHP. Besides, DEHP-contaminated sediment was collected from Kai Tak Approach Channel, Kowloon. This sediment contained 44. 4 - 128. 0 mg/kg DEHP and heavy metals 21. 3 - 23. 4 mg/kg Cd, 24. 9 - 43. 5 mg/kg Ni, 128. 5 - 198. 5 mg/kg Pb, 144. 6 - 329. 2 mg/kg Zn and 164. 5 - 230. 0 mg/kg Cu, and bore an unpleasant sewer smell. SMC and SMCE as strong oxidizing agents could decrease the S content of sediment significantly as well as calcium nitrate, and consequently lowered the evolution of nuisance gas hydrogen sulfide. With the treatment of the optimized combination of 2. 25 % SMCE and 0. 25 % nitrate, the malodor could be removed completely and the contents of H 2 S and NH 3 in the air were decreased significantly. For the degradation of organic pollutants, the target pollutant DEHP showed a sharp decrease in the first week in the time effect experiment after the treatment with the combination of 2. 25 % SMCE and 0. 25 % nitrate, while the decrease of DEHP slowed down in the second week. The results may be attributed to the immediate degradation of DEHP by enzymes in SMCE. When raw sediment and nitrate-treated sediment were bioremediated with SMCE, larger fluctuation in DEHP removal was observed with the nitrate-treated sediment. It supports that nitrate and SMCE would act in optimum at a certain combination. The effect on mobilization of sediment heavy metals by SMC or SMCE was also examined. Although some laboratory results suggested reduction of copper and lead, other results using different environmental samples of the sediment did not reproduce the results. Further investigation is needed. Plasticizers are additives used in the manufacture of plastics, and high residual plasticizer levels are encountered in the environment. Bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), being the most common plasticizer, is a suspected human carcinogen and an endocrine disruptor. Therefore, DEHP-contaminated soil, sediment and water samples were collected, and the bioremediation capacities of the spent compost of mushroom Pleurotus pulmonarius (SMC) were determined. This study reveals the potential in applying SMC of P. pulmonarius in bioremediation of DEHP from the soil, sediment and water environments. More investigation and field studies would be appropriate for developing spent P. pulmonarius compost in environmental cleanup. Using artificially spiked garden soil with DEHP and ultra-low sulphur diesel, the removal efficiencies of SMC were 41. 7 +/- 9. 8 % and 36. 1 +/- 8. 4 % for TP 11 and DEHP, respectively. SMCE which contained the water-soluble nutrients, SMC <b>enzymes</b> <b>and</b> <b>micro-organisms</b> had about half removal efficiency of SMC on the same pollutant. The enriched SMC microorganisms also showed biodegradation of DEHP and diesel, so did the filtrate containing enzymes and nutrients of SMC. Thus SMC acted in multiple ways in bioremediation of DEHP: biostimulation and bioaugmentation. Besides, the immobilized lignolytic enzymes of the mushroom P. pulmonarius {{played a major role in}} biodegradation. Gao, Ting. "October 2009. "Adviser: S. W. Chiu.
