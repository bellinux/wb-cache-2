25|$|Within {{days of his}} {{confession}} in open court, Heirens denied any responsibility for the murders. Mary Jane Blanchard, daughter of murder victim Josephine Ross, {{was one of the}} first dissenters, being quoted in 1946 as saying:I cannot believe that young Heirens murdered my mother. He just does not fit into the picture of my mother's death... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> at all the things Heirens stole and there was nothing of my mother's things among them.|$|E
500|$|Although Fischer {{had ended}} his formal {{education}} at age 16, {{dropping out of}} Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, he subsequently taught himself several foreign languages so he could read foreign chess periodicals. According to Latvian chess master Alexander Koblencs, even he and Tal could not match the commitment that Fischer had made to chess. Recalling a conversation from the tournament: Tell me, Bobby,' Tal continued, 'what {{do you think of}} the playing style of Larissa Volpert?' 'She's too cautious. But you have another girl, Dmitrieva. Her games do appeal to me!' Here we were left literally open-mouthed in astonishment. Misha and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> at thousands of games, but it never even occurred to us to study the games of our women players. How could we find the time for this?! Yet Bobby, it turns out, had found the time! ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{looking back}} on his early films, Pauline Kael writes that Mankiewicz had, in fact, written (alone or with others) [...] "about forty of the films I {{remember}} best from the twenties and thirties. I hadn't realized how extensive his career was. ... and now that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> into Herman Mankiewicz's career it's apparent {{that he was a}} key linking figure in just the kind of movies my friends and I loved best. These were the hardest-headed periods of American movies ... the most highly acclaimed directors of that period, suggests that the writers...in little more than a decade, gave American talkies their character." ...|$|E
60|$|Whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> for, <b>I</b> don't know. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not <b>looked</b> for him. Seeing him, I {{felt that}} I {{was in a}} {{dangerous}} strait indeed, and I kept my eyes upon him.|$|R
60|$|Alexander Abraham groaned, but I {{could see}} that the way <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> him over <b>had</b> chastened him considerably.|$|R

6000|$|... 'All battles are but chance work, your Majesty,' remarked Saxon, whose sword-arm {{was bound}} round with his kerchief. 'Some lucky turn, some slip or chance which none can foresee, is ever {{likely to turn}} the scale. I have lost when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> to win, and I have won when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> to lose. It is an {{uncertain}} game, and one never knows the finish till the last card is played.' ...|$|E
60|$|But the boy whom <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> upon as ignorant {{because of}} never having {{lived on the}} frontier, was now shaming me by his actions.|$|R
60|$|But I {{reckoned}} {{without the}} hatred Rinolfo bore me. Instead of the prompt obedience that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> for, he <b>had</b> turned again to my mother.|$|R
60|$|I did {{not look}} at her, but I could feel her standing, {{watching}} me. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> up, she would, <b>I</b> knew, <b>have</b> held out her arms to me....|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> at her a {{great many}} times while Monsieur has been talking: I can see her quite well from this corner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-night," [...] she murmured, [...] "there {{will be no}} ships, Arnold. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> {{and looked}} and I am sure. Light the lamp, please." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear child," [...] he said, [...] "surely {{that was}} inevitable, was it not? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> upon it as {{almost certain to}} happen some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|JACK. [Ruefully {{holding out}} the empty reticule.] Is that the thing? <b>I</b> <b>'ve</b> <b>looked</b> all over--I can't find the purse anywhere. Are you sure it was there? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's great stuff, ma'am," [...] said J. Pinkney Bloom, enthusiastically, {{when the}} poetess had concluded. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> up poetry more than <b>I</b> <b>have.</b> <b>I</b> {{was raised in}} the pine hills myself." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Common parlance is a {{deceitful}} thing,' said Louis, sighing; 'people can't even be sincere {{without doing}} harm! Well, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> {{to see her}} made happy by harmony between those two!' ...|$|R
6000|$|This new {{complication}} was {{too much}} for me. In planning out my manoeuvres <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken his cooperation for granted. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> on him as so much baggage--the impedimenta of the retreating army. And, behold, a mutineer! ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> at {{the larger}} {{half of the}} first volume of your novel, and have pursued the more {{difficult}} points of the story through the other two volumes.|$|E

6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> at {{the lights}} of Broadway by night, I made to my American friends an {{innocent}} remark that seemed for some reason to amuse them. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked,</b> not without joy, at that long kaleidoscope of coloured lights arranged in large letters and sprawling trade-marks, advertising everything, from pork to pianos, {{through the agency of}} the two most vivid and most mystical of the gifts of God; colour and fire. I said to them, in my simplicity, 'What a glorious garden of wonders this would be, to any one who was lucky enough to be unable to read.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{me about}} yourself, Rachel. Where {{have you been}} so long? <b>I</b> <b>'ve</b> <b>looked</b> and waited for you ever since the second little note you sent me on last Christinas; but you never came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I may now avow, Mr Clennam,' said he, with a cordial {{shake of}} the hand, 'that if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>looked</b> {{high and low}} for a partner, I believe <b>I</b> could not <b>have</b> found one more to my mind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless you, Mr. Walker--Weller, I mean--a {{great many}} things, {{if you will}} come away somewhere, where we can talk comfortably. If you knew how <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>looked</b> for you, Mr. Weller--' ...|$|E
