However, {{it is possible}} to have a single electricity generation company and still have retail competition. If a wholesale price can be established at a node on the transmission grid and the electricity quantities at that node can be reconciled, competition for retail customers within the distribution system beyond the node is possible. In the German market, for example, large, vertically integrated utilities compete with one another for customers on a more or less open grid.|$|E

30|$|Many {{studies on}} the <b>wholesale</b> <b>electricity</b> market compare two {{atypical}} auction systems, discriminatory and uniform price auction, which have been applied to <b>wholesale</b> <b>electricity</b> trading. Those studies are further classified based on whether they adopt discrete step function or continuous supply function equilibrium. Fabra et al. (2006) is a major study that adopted step function, while Genc (2009) and Genc and Reynols (2011) adopted supply function equilibrium. Expressing <b>wholesale</b> <b>electricity</b> auction by supply function equilibrium is often criticized for not reflecting realistic discrete trading. However, {{the gap between the}} discrete and continuous models is bridged by recent studies, most notably Holmberg et al. (2013).|$|R

30|$|The {{proposition}} {{includes the}} result where the equilibrium peak-time retail electricity price becomes {{lower than the}} default price. Why should such a result occur? Larger α implies the <b>wholesale</b> <b>electricity</b> supply function is relatively flat. Remember that the retail electricity price depends on two factors, <b>wholesale</b> <b>electricity</b> price as a cost component and marginal retail service cost. While the <b>wholesale</b> <b>electricity</b> price becomes almost constant because of its flat supply function, marginal retail service cost diminished significantly after the system reform. The default retail electricity price could become higher for the remaining retail service cost. This is why the peak-time price becomes lower than the default price.|$|R
5000|$|When <b>electricity</b> <b>wholesale</b> prices {{exceeded}} retail prices, {{end user}} demand was unaffected, but the incumbent utility companies {{still had to}} purchase power, albeit at a loss. This allowed independent producers to manipulate prices in the electricity market by withholding electricity generation, arbitraging the price between internal generation and imported (interstate) power, and causing artificial transmission constraints. This was a procedure referred to as [...] "gaming the market." [...] In economic terms, the incumbents who were still subject to retail price caps were faced with inelastic demand (see also: Demand response). They were unable to pass the higher prices on to consumers without approval from the public utilities commission. The affected incumbents were Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). Pro-privatization advocates insist {{the cause of the}} problem was that the regulator still held too much control over the market, and true market processes were stymied, whereas opponents of deregulation assert that the fully regulated system had worked for 40 years without blackouts.|$|E

Firm-level events have only had a minor impact on the intensity of competition. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|E
