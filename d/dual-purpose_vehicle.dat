50|$|At the launch, Navistar {{expected}} {{business owners}} {{to account for}} most sales, marketing the vehicle as a <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>vehicle</b> as both a working and promotional vehicle. Shortly after its launch, the XT trucks also became attractive to celebrities. Notable owners include Ashton Kutcher, Russell J. Young, Red Bull, Viktor Yanukovych, and basketball stars Shaquille O'Neal and Roy Jones, Jr., while Nick Lachey and Jay Leno {{are said to have}} taken test drives.|$|E
50|$|The Ann Arbor was an {{automobile}} manufactured in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by the Huron River Manufacturing Company from 1911-12. The Ann Arbor was a <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>vehicle,</b> {{which could be}} converted from a private car, to a small pickup. Automotive production, however, never succeeded in Ann Arbor. The ill-fated Huron River Manufacturing Company, later the Star Motor Company, did not survive the fierce competition of the burgeoning auto industry. The high cost of living in Ann Arbor meant higher wages and the distance from Detroit increased the cost of materials {{to a point where}} profit disappeared.|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>vehicle</b> mount, the M2HB (heavy barrel) proved {{extremely}} {{effective in}} U.S. service: the Browning's [...]50 caliber AP and API rounds could easily penetrate {{the engine block}} or fuel tanks of a German Bf 109 fighter attacking at low altitude, or perforate the hull plates and fuel tanks of a German half-track or light armored car. While the dual-purpose mounting was undeniably useful, it did normally require the operator to stand when using the M2 in a ground role, exposing him to return fire. Units in the field often modified the mountings on their vehicles, especially tanks and tank destroyers, to provide more operator protection in the anti-vehicular and anti-personnel role. The weapon was particularly hated by the Germans, whose attacks and ambushes against otherwise helpless stalled motor convoys were frequently broken up by [...]50 caliber machine gun fire. Vehicles would frequently [...] "recon by fire" [...] with the M2 Browning, i.e. they would fire continuously at suspected points of ambush while moving through areas still containing enemy forces. One vehicle would fire exclusively to the right, the following vehicle to the left, the next one to the right, and so on in order to cover both flanks of the advancing convoy.|$|E

50|$|As of June 2011, 392,276 {{vehicles}} are registered on the island. 46% consists {{of cars and}} <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>vehicles</b> and 41% of motorized two-wheelers. The remaining 13% consists of vans, lorries and trucks, buses and other vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The German {{occupation}} of Italy during World War II {{resulted in a}} severe shortage of mechanized farm equipment. The destruction of tractors {{was a sort of}} scorched-earth strategy used to reduce the independence of the conquered. The shortage of tractors in that area of Europe was the origin of Lamborghini. The war was also the inspiration for <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>vehicles</b> such as the Land Rover. Based on the Jeep, the company made a vehicle that combined PTO, tillage, and transportation.|$|R
50|$|The BET {{group were}} the largest purchasers in England and Wales. Of their subsidiaries, Western Welsh with {{a fleet of}} 271 had the most. In Scotland the largest {{customer}} was Walter Alexander & Sons who took 200 between 1955 and 1964. The largest municipal fleet was that of Edinburgh Corporation, who took 100 from 1959 to 1961, these were also the largest fleet of pneumocyclic Tiger Cubs. The Ulster Transport Authority in Northern Ireland and JMT on Jersey were the major customers for the narrow manual version, which Jersey initially took with shorter than standard rear overhang, reducing length to around 27 ft. West Bromwich Corporation took seven of the narrow pneumocyclic version, the only ones built. Independents took Tiger Cubs as buses, coaches and <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>vehicles,</b> but as with the municipal Market, the Tiger Cub was not as strong a seller as the AEC Reliance.|$|R
50|$|The third, {{and likely}} most {{effective}} kind of tank destroyer was the unturreted, casemate-style tank destroyer, {{known by the}} Jagdpanzer term in German service, or Samokhodnaya ustanovka in Soviet service for their own designs. These generally featured a heavy gun mounted on an older or then-current tank chassis, with the gun pointing forward with a limited degree of traverse. Casemate tank destroyers often had {{the same amount of}} armour as the tanks they were based on. The removal of the turret allowed for greater room to mount a larger gun with a larger breech and leave room for crew. Many casemate tank destroyers either originated as, or were <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>vehicles</b> with the duty of a self-propelled gun, which share many (but usually not all) of the same features and layout. Some examples are the German Sturmgeschütz III - the most-produced German armored fighting vehicle of WW II — and the Soviets' SU-100, itself based on the T-34 tank's hull and drivetrain.|$|R
5000|$|In England, {{sizeable}} Leopard fleets {{were built}} up by various National Bus Company subsidiaries including Birmingham & Midland Omnibus Company. BET Group subsidiaries were major customers for Leopards. For buses and <b>dual-purpose</b> <b>vehicles,</b> a BET standard design of bodywork was produced, primarily by Marshall and Willowbrook {{but also to}} a lesser extent by Weymann and Metro-Cammell. Another major English customer for the Leyland Leopard was Barton Transport of Chilwell near Nottingham, which built up a fleet of 200 with Plaxton Elite and Supreme coach bodywork. Unusually for a large operator, Barton standardised on this type of vehicle for all types of work including local stage carriage services; for this reason, all were fitted with a wide two-piece door, known as an [...] "express" [...] or a [...] "grant" [...] door. The latter term refers to the New Bus Grant, whereby the British Government paid part of the cost of a new bus providing it met certain specifications and spent a prescribed proportion of its time on local service work. Many other operators took advantage of this and bought Leopards built to the grant specification.|$|R
50|$|By the 1980s, the {{sections}} of route between Heathrow and Windsor and between Gravesend and Dartford had been withdrawn. At that time the Green Line network was operated by London Country Bus Services, but when that company was broken up in 1986 route 726, which ran almost entirely within Greater London, came {{under the control of}} London Country North West (LCNW) and Kentish Bus & Coach. In 1991 LCNW planned to withdraw the route, but London Regional Transport stepped in and took the route over. LCNW continued to operate the route on a short term one-year contract. On 29 February 1992, London Coaches, a subsidiary of London Buses privatised in 1992, commenced operating the route using <b>dual-purpose</b> DAF SB220 <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
