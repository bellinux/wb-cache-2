Its applications {{are for the}} creation of a missing neutral connection from an ungrounded 3-phase system to permit the grounding of that neutral to an earth reference point and also <b>harmonic</b> <b>mitigation,</b> as it can suppress triplet (3rd, 9th, 15th, 21st, etc.) harmonic currents, to supply 3-phase power as an autotransformer (serving as the primary and secondary with no isolated circuits), and to supply non-standard, phase-shifted, 3-phase power.Nine-winding, three-phase transformers typically have 3 primaries and 6 identical secondary windings, which can be used in zigzag winding connection as pictured. As with the conventional delta or wye winding configuration three-phase transformer, a standard, stand-alone transformer containing only six windings on three cores can also be used in zigzag winding connection, such transformer sometimes being referred to as a zigzag bank. In all cases, six or nine winding, the first coil on each zigzag winding core is connected contrariwise to the second coil on the next core. The second coils are then all tied together to form the neutral, and the phases are connected to the primary coils. Each phase, therefore, couples with each other phase, and the voltages cancel out. As such, there would be negligible current through the neutral point, which can be tied to ground.|$|E

40|$|With stringent, and {{globally}} sanctioned, environmental {{rules and}} regulations, dictating limits for allowed emissions {{of greenhouse gases}} and particle matter from combustion of fossil fuels, the marine vessel’s efficiency has recently received a lot of attention. At the same time, in addition to meet environmental requirements from multiple stakeholders, ship owners strive to enhance revenue in an economically challenged market by reducing operational costs and gain competitive advantages. Examples of such competitive advantages are reduced environmental footprints, increased vessel/ operational platform efficiency, operational flexibility and reliability, and higher Environmental Regularity Numbers (ERN). To asses the marine vessel’s efficiency is complex and involves multiple disciplines. In this work, the main contributions are centered around the discipline automation and automatic control design, with the use of optimization-based control strategies to improve the (AC) shipboard power plant’s efficiency. Two topics are covered in this thesis: Optimal <b>harmonic</b> <b>mitigation</b> using Model Predictive Control (MPC), and optimization-based unit commitment as part of Energy Management Systems (EMS). These two topics, although intertwined, represents different levels of power system control and contribute both to the efficiency of the shipboard power plant. The thesis is divided into three parts. The first part, which is covered by Chapter 2, presents a review of the shipboard electrical power system’s evolution. From the first successful use of shipboard electricity, marked by the use of electricity in SS Columbia in 1880 for illumination purposes, to present day with all-electric vessels using batteries, the shipboard power system has transitioned from containing few single-purpose passive components to containing many multi-purpose active components that rely on automatic control. Thus, the discipline automation and automatic control design plays an important part in the present stage of the shipboard electrical power system’s evolution. Chapter 2 ends with a discussion of properties and challenges of the marine vessel’s power system, including, among others, AC vs DC, integrated power systems and grid design, power electronics, harmonic pollution and electrical stability, and the increasing level of software complexity. The second part of the thesis, which is covered by Chapter 3 - 5, addresses the problem of harmonic pollution and presents a novel <b>harmonic</b> <b>mitigation</b> strategy based on optimal control. The proposed method, which relies on a single, controllable Active Power Filter (APF), uses an MPC that (online) generates APF current references based on an optimization objective to minimize the total harmonic pollution in the whole power system – a system-level <b>harmonic</b> <b>mitigation</b> approach. Chapter 3 presents simulation results of the proposed method compared with two conventional APF control strategies using a two-bus shipboard power system with 6 - and 12 - pulse rectifier loads as test subject. The results demonstrate that the MPC is able to generate current references that better utilize the APF current capability for system-level <b>harmonic</b> <b>mitigation,</b> and is able to reduce the Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) beyond what is achieved with the conventional mitigation approaches. Chapter 4 introduces a system-level <b>harmonic</b> <b>mitigation</b> approach, also considering the control of a single APF, that is based on offline analytical optimization. The offline analytical optimization method is compared with the MPC in Chapter 3 and conventional mitigation strategies using a two-bus shipboard power system with 12 -pulse rectifier loads as test subject. Non-idealities, such as parameter-mismatch and transformer saturation, are introduced in the simulation, and the results show that also in this case the MPC-based system-level <b>harmonic</b> <b>mitigation</b> method is superior compared to the offline analytical optimization and the conventional mitigation approaches. The last chapter in this part, Chapter 5, addresses an event-based system architecture with real-time implementation of a single-phase version of the MPC presented in Chapter 3 and 4 for system-level <b>harmonic</b> <b>mitigation.</b> Hardware-In-Loop (HIL) simulations using two desktop computers and a simulator demonstrate that the proposed system architecture and MPC implementation meet the real-time requirements for system-level <b>harmonic</b> <b>mitigation.</b> The last part of the thesis, which is covered by Chapter 6, addresses the problem of unit commitment in an Energy Management System (EMS). Real power system data from three different vessels in operation, a ferry, a Platform Supply Vessel (PSV) and a seismic survey vessel, are extracted and analyzed with regards to diesel-generator-set (genset) loadings and genset running hours to shed light on potential fuel efficiency improvements. As demonstrated by the extracted data, the gensets in all three vessels run with non-optimal loading conditions relative individual gensets’ Specific Fuel Oil Consumption (SFOC) curves. Two unit commitment methods, one based on Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (optimization) and one based on logics, are presented and discussed. Moreover, three power system configurations are proposed; i) four fixed-speed gensets, ii) three fixed-speed genset and one variable-speed genset, and iii) four fixed-speed gensets and an Energy Storage System (ESS). The two unit commitment methods are compared by simulation studies of the three proposed power system configurations, using the real load profiles extracted from the three vessels during operation. The simulation results indicate that optimal EMS algorithms in combination with a revised power system configuration can increase the operational efficiency, in terms of fuel savings and reduction in genset running hours.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} penetration of power electronic equipment in modern residential distribution systems, <b>harmonics</b> <b>mitigation</b> through the distributed generation (DG) interfacing converters has received significant attention.
