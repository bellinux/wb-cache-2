40|$|Introduction: Platelets play {{a crucial}} role in the {{pathogenesis}} of acute coronary syndromes. Accordingly, previous studies showed increased platelet reactivity on admission in these patients. In this study we assessed platelet reactivity at short-medium term follow-up in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). Materials and methods: Fifty-nine patients (58 ± 11 years, 45 men), treated with primary angioplasty, were studied 1 month after STEMI. Thirty-five patients were retested at 6 months. Twenty matched patients with stable coronary artery disease served as controls. Platelet reactivity was assessed by flow cyometry at rest and at peak exercise, with and without adenosine diphosphate (ADP) stimulation, by measuring monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPAs) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (CD 41) expression in the MPA gate, and CD 41 and fibrinogen receptor (PAC- 1) expression in the platelet gate. Results: Compared to controls, basal MPAs and CD 41 in the MPA gate were <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> both at 1 month (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 002, respectively) and at 6 months (p = 0. 03 and p = 0. 01, respectively). Basal CD 41 and PAC- 1 expression was also <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> at the two assessments compared to controls (P < 0. 001 for both). Exercise induced a similar increase in platelet reactivity in patients and controls. ADP induced a higher increase in CD 41 platelet expression in STEMI patients compared to controls both at 1 and 6 months (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Platelet reactivity is increased in the first 6 months after STEMI. The persistence of increased platelet reactivity in this time period may play a role in the early recurrence of coronary events after STEMI...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} clinical outcome for different indications for PCI in an unselected, nationwide PCI population at short- and long-term follow-up. Methods and results: We evaluated clinical outcome up to six years after PCI in all patients undergoing a PCI procedure for different indications in Sweden between 2006 and 2010. A total of 70, 479 patients were treated for stable coronary artery disease (CAD) (21. 0 %), unstable angina (11. 0 %), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (36. 6 %) and ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (31. 4 %). Mortality was <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> at one year after PCI (9. 6 %) compared to NSTEMI (4. 7 %), unstable angina (2. 2 %) and stable CAD (2. 0 %). At one year after PCI until the end of follow-up, the adjusted mortality risk (one to six years after PCI) and the risk of myocardial infarction were comparable between NSTEMI and STEMI patients and lower in patients with unstable angina and stable CAD. The adjusted risk of stent thrombosis and heart failure was highest in STEMI patients. Conclusions: The risk of short-term mortality, heart failure and stent thrombosis is highest for STEMI patients after PCI. Therapies to reduce stent thrombosis and heart failure appear to be most important in decreasing mortality in patients with STEMI or NSTEMI undergoing PCI...|$|E
40|$|Background: Inflammation {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a contributor to different stages in the pathogenesis of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). High sensitive C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP), an acute-phase plasma protein synthesized by the liver, is the most extensively studied systemic marker of inflammation. Elevated hsCRP concentrations early in Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), prior to the tissue necrosis, may be a surrogate marker for cardiovascular co-morbidities. The cardiac marker enzymes Creatine Kinase myocardial bound (CK-MB), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) {{have been known to}} be increased in coronary artery diseases. Objective: The aim {{of the study was to}} measure hs-CRP levels and other cardiac marker enzymes in ACS patients and to compare the levels of hs-CRP with other cardiac marker enzymes between ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and Non-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI) patients. Material and Methods: The study group consisted of 207 consecutive patients admitted to Sri Siddhartha Medical College Hospital within the first 6 hours from the onset of chest pain. Patients were diagnosed as Unstable Angina (UA), (n= 84); STEMI (n= 63) and NSTEMI (n= 60). ACS patients were compared with 211 healthy age and sex matched controls. Hs-CRP, CK-MB, AST and LDH levels were measured by standard methods in both groups at baseline and forcases at 36 - 48 hours i. e. Peak levels. Results: ACS patients had significantly (p< 0. 05) higher levels of hs-CRP, CKMB, AST and LDH in comparison to controls at baseline. Hs-CRP, CK-MB, AST and LDH levels were significantly <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> compared to NSTEMI patients (p< 0. 05) at baseline. There was a significant difference regarding peak hs-CRP levels between the two groups, as STEMI patients had significantly higher peak hs-CRP levels compared to NSTEMI patients (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: STEMI patients have significantly higher peak hsCRP levels compared to NSTEMI patients. These data suggest that inflammatory processes play an independent role in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction. Thus, Hs-CRP assessment may assist in risk stratification after myocardial infarction...|$|E

40|$|T {{lymphocytes}} play {{an important}} role in the induction and progression of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). To gain insight into how different T cell subsets can influence ACS, we analyzed the frequencies of circulating CD 4 (+) T cells producing either pro-inflammatory interferon(IFN) -gamma or anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL) - 10 in subjects presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The effect of coronary bare metal (BS) and paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) on the balance between CD 4 (+) IFN-gamma(+) and CD 4 (+) L- 10 (+) lymphocytes was also investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from 38 consecutive patients with STEMI before and 48 hrs or 6 days after implantation of either BS or PES. Twenty patients with no history of coronary artery disease were included as basal controls. PBMC were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD 3 /anti-CD 28 monoclonal antibodies, and CD 4 (+) IFN-gamma(+) or CD 4 (+) IL- 10 (+) T cells were detected by flow cytometry intracellular staining. The frequency of peripheral CD 4 (+) IL- 10 (+) T cells was significantly <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> as compared with controls. Conversely, the frequency of CD 4 (+) IFN-gamma(+) T lymphocytes did not differ between STEMI and subjects without history of coronary artery disease. Six days after the revascularization procedure, the percentage of CD 4 (+) IL- 10 (+) T cells was significantly decreased in BS but not in the PES group, whereas the relative percentage of CD 4 (+) IFN-gamma(+) T lymphocytes were diminished in both groups as compared with baseline levels. Our data indicate that STEMI is associated with a peripheral expansion of CD 4 (+) IL- 10 (+) T lymphocytes, and that primary coronary revascularization with implantation of either BS or PES is followed by a reduction in circulating CD 4 (+) IFN-gamma(+) T lymphocytes. PES implantation, however, appears to inhibit the relative decrease of the IL- 10 producing lymphocyte as observed in BS implanted patients, shifting the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory T cell populations in favor of the latter...|$|E
40|$|Acute ST segment {{elevation}} {{myocardial infarction}} (STEMI) {{is the most}} life threatening presentation in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). This typically occurs due to rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque with thrombus formation, occlusion or partial occlusion of an epicardial vessel and the onset of myocardial ischaemia. The well established treatment of choice is early primary percutaneous intervention (PCI) to restore culprit coronary artery flow, halt ischaemia and prevent myocardial necrosis. Historically, discussions of the inflammatory processes {{around the time of}} coronary plaque disruption and thrombotic occlusion have centred on intra-plaque macrophages and T lymphocytes. Although neutrophils are widely recognised as important mediators of myocardial and vascular injury following ischaemic reperfusion injury much less is currently known of their role prior to recannalization of the culprit vessel. Previous studies have shown that neutrophils are activated systemically in unstable angina and myocardial infarction. It has also been suggested that in patients with unstable angina a trans-cardiac gradient exists, with up-regulation of neutrophil activation from the aorta to coronary sinus. The concept of widespread inflammation across the coronary vasculature independent of culprit lesion location has been considered, and neutrophil infiltrates have been found in culprit plaque specimens from patients who have died following acute myocardial infarction (MI). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme enzyme, and leukocyte elastase (LE) a serine protease contained within the azurophilic granules of neutrophils. Upon neutrophil activation and degranulation these enzymes are released into the plasma. MPO has been considered a surrogate marker of neutrophil activation and plasma levels of the enzyme found to be elevated in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Plasma MPO levels have also been investigated in patients presenting with troponin negative ACS and found to be higher than controls suggesting the early activation of neutrophils. MPO has several potentially deletrious effects including the ability to catalyse the production of several reactive oxidant species such as hypochlorus acid which can chlorinate both proteins and lipids. It also consumes nitric oxide affecting endothelial function leading to vasoconstriction. Leukocyte elastase is associated with extracellular matrix breakdown and up-regulation of cytokines and metalloproteinases. Elastase has been found within atherosclerotic plaques and through its actions in matrix degradation has been associated with plaque rupture. Activation of neutrophils at the culprit coronary lesion following acute plaque disruption in the very early stages of STEMI has not previously been reported. This thesis details a programme of original work exploring three different aspects of neutrophil activation. The first section covers the neutrophil derived enzyme MPO and explores the factors influencing systemic and local levels of the enzyme, at the culprit coronary lesion in patients with acute STEMI. The second section investigates neutrophil activation through intracellular degranulation and release of MPO using flow cytometry, and surface expression of the adhesion molecule CD 11 b. Finally plasma levels of LE, an alternative marker of neutrophil degranulation and one which is not affected by the delivery of unfractionated heparin are explored. The central hypothesis was that the neutrophil derived enzymes have an early role in events subsequent to plaque instability and prior to mechanical reperfusion therapy. STEMI patients presenting to the emergency department at Christchurch Hospital who were eligible for treatment with primary PCI according to standard criteria were approached to participate. Exclusion criteria included left main stem disease, cardiogenic shock, stent thrombosis and rescue PCI post thrombolysis. Patients with class II-III angina symptoms and documented stable coronary artery disease undergoing elective, single vessel PCI were studied as a control. Blood was sampled peripherally from the femoral artery (FA) sheath prior to the delivery of weight adjusted heparin. Further sampling was carried out prior to angioplasty and stenting in the ascending aorta (Ao) at the coronary ostium from the guiding catheter and from the coronary sinus (CS) using a separate catheter introduced via the femoral vein. The culprit coronary lesion was sampled prior to PCI using a low profile, minimally disruptive sampling catheter. Following PCI, {{with the exception of the}} FA, blood was drawn from the aforementioned sites again, and at 24 hours after presentation from a forearm vein. Whole blood flow cytometry was performed immediately to determine the intracellular concentration of neutrophil MPO and the expression of the surface adhesion molecule CD 11 b. Plasma MPO and LE were measured using standardised enzyme linked immune-sorbent assays (ELISA). We found that MPO levels at the FA were <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> compared to elective PCI controls. The delivery of unfractionated heparin but not bivalirudin lead to a marked increase in MPO levels at all sampling sites in both groups. Despite this we showed a further rise in MPO at the culprit coronary lesion in STEMI prior to PCI. MPO levels were higher in patients who presented earlier, and in those with baseline Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 0 - 1 flow in the culprit vessel. These results were supported by the finding of increased neutrophil degranulation, with release of intracellular MPO at all sampling sites in STEMIs versus controls. A further subtle reduction in neutrophil intracellular MPO content in STEMI patients at the culprit lesion pre PCI and at the coronary ostium in the aortic root was demonstrated. In keeping with the MPO results, we found that LE was elevated in STEMI patients compared to controls and was highest locally at the culprit lesion pre PCI. The increase in local plasma elastase was seen predominantly in patients with TIMI 0 - 1 flow in the culprit vessel. Prior to PCI we showed a subtle gradient across the coronary vasculature from the aorta to the coronary sinus which was not present following re-instatement of coronary flow. The studies contained within this thesis support recent suggestions that neutrophil activation is an early event in the pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction, in this particular setting ST elevation MI, and can be detected prior to treatment in its current best form. Our results suggest that in addition to a systemic release of MPO in patients presenting with acute STEMI, plasma levels of this neutrophil derived enzyme are higher at the culprit lesion in the coronary artery prior to primary PCI. We have also demonstrated that plasma levels of neutrophil enzymes at the culprit lesion are influenced by baseline TIMI flow in the coronary artery. Additionally we have confirmed that heparin, yet not bivalirudin causes an elevation in detectable MPO in the plasma and suggest that future work aimed at probing associations between MPO in ACS should acknowledge this...|$|E

MethodsThe study included 141 <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients,</b> with acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. Plasma HMGB 1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay at admission. Forty-two healthy individuals served as control subjects.

Studies that examined field triage and/or referral via a spoke centre <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> treated with primary or facilitated PCI were included. Two authors independently conducted the study selection and data extraction. Multivariable frequency weighted logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of the type of transfer on the outcome measures. We identified 14 randomised clinical trials (RCTs), including 20 transfer groups and 4474 participants. Thirty-day mortality was lower in patients who underwent field triage (3. 0 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 2 - 4. 2) compared to patients who were referred via a spoke centre (4. 7 %; 95 % CI 4. 0 - 5. 5).

40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is around 66 STEMI per 100000 of population/year, with 6 – 12 % hospital mortality in unselected patients [1]. Modern treatment strategies for STEMI {{are based on}} immediate antithrombotic treatment and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation. Therapy {{with a combination of}} two or even three more potent antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents reduces both short-term and long-term ischemic risk, morbidity and mortality; on the other hand it is associated with higher risks of bleeding. The first part of this review is focused on the pathogenesis of thrombi <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> and antithrombotic drugs currently used to treat <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients.</b> <b>In</b> the second part we discuss several factors that can affect bleeding risks including the choice of access site for coronary angiography, prevention and treatment of bleeding <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients.</b> Finding a balance which minimizes both thrombotic and bleeding risk is crucial, although, it can be difficult and further randomized studies directed at finding this balance are needed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: There remains {{considerable}} heterogeneity in {{the management}} of significant lesions in non culprit coronary arteries <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Three recent randomised trials have shown clinical outcome benefit in a complete revascularisation approach when compared to PPCI of the culprit artery alone. By contrast, observational data suggest that an aggressive complete revascularisation may not confer clinical benefit and may, in some cases, be harmful. Areas covered: In this review we discuss the three recent randomised trials that have advocated a complete revasculariation approach in addition to data available from registries. Expert commentary: An adequately powered, randomised controlled trial is required to answer the question of whether complete revascularisation <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> is beneficial and, if so, whether it should be ischaemia directed and whether it should be at the index procedure or staged. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Major {{bleeding}} complications <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> result <b>in</b> significant mortality, {{morbidity and}} healthcare cost. Identification of patients {{at increased risk}} of bleeding is therefore essential. New biomarkers might be of incremental value to identify patients at risk for bleeding after primary PCI. A total of 26 biomarkers were measured at enrolment and analyzed at a central core laboratory <b>in</b> 464 <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> the HORIZONS-AMI trial. We investigated the relationship between tertiles of biomarker and in hospital non-CABG major bleeding. In hospital non-CABG major bleeding occurred in 3. 7 % of patients (n = 17).

ResultsIn-segment LLL was 0. 68 ± 0. 57 mm in the BMS group and 0. 12 ± 0. 43 mm in the SES group with a mean difference of 0. 56 mm, 95 % confidence interval 0. 43 to 0. 68 mm (p < 0. 001). Late stent malapposition at 9 months was present in 12. 5 % BMS patients and in 37. 5 % SES patients (p < 0. 001). Event-free survival at 12 months was 73. 6 % in BMS patients and 86. 0 % in SES patients (p = 0. 01). The target-vessel-failure-free survival was 84. 7 % in the BMS group and 93. 0 % in the SES group (p = 0. 02), mainly because of a higher target lesion revascularization rate in BMS patients (11. 3 % vs. 3. 2 %; p = 0. 006). Rates of death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis were not different. ConclusionsSirolimus-eluting stent implantation <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> is associated with a favorable midterm clinical and angiographic outcome compared with treatment with BMS. However, LSM raises concern about the long-term safety of SES <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> (MISSION!; ISRCTN 62825862) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background: Cardiogenic shock (CS) {{remains the}} most serious {{complication}} of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a frequent complication of STEMI and a well-known predictor of mortality <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> without CS. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prognostic significance of MR <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> with CS on admission. Methods: Mitral regurgitation was assessed <b>in</b> 147 consecutive <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> with CS on admission and treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Color Doppler of MR was graded with a 0 to 3 scale (none, n = 26; 1 = mild, n = 62; 2 = moderate, n = 40; 3 = severe, n = 19). Results: Overall one-year mortality in the study cohort was 27 %. One-year mortality was 8 %, 23 %, 30 % and 58 % for patients with no, mild, moderate and severe MR respectively (P < 0. 001). For each grade of MR increase, the odds for mortality increased with 71 % (OR: 1. 71; 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 2. 87; P = 0. 043) when adjusted for age, gender, previous myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40 %, multivessel disease and no-reflow.

MethodsWe performed an up-to-date search for all RCTs investigating adenosine {{as an adjunct}} to reperfusion <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients.</b> We calculated pooled relative risks using a fixed-effect meta-analysis assessing the impact of adjunctive adenosine therapy on major clinical endpoint including all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Surrogate markers of reperfusion were also analyzed. Results 13 RCTs (4273 <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients)</b> were identified and divided into 2 subgroups: intracoronary adenosine versus control (8 RCTs) and intravenous adenosine versus control (5 RCTs). In patients administered intracoronary adenosine, the incidence of heart failure was significantly lower (risk ratio [RR] 0. 44 [95 % CI 0. 25 – 0. 78], P= 0. 005) and the incidence of coronary no-reflow was reduced (RR for TIMI flow< 3 postreperfusion 0. 68 [95 % CI 0. 47 – 0. 99], P= 0. 04).

40|$|Objectives We {{aimed to}} investigate, in {{patients}} with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), whether the previously reported clinical benefits of sirolimus-eluting stent(s) (SES) in terms of reducing a major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) compared with bare-metal stent(s) (BMS) were maintained over a 5 -year time period. Background In the prospective single-centre randomized DEBATER trial, SES significantly reduced the rate of MACCE <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> within 1 year compared with BMS, mainly driven by a reduction of target lesion revascularization. Randomized data on the long-term safety and efficacy of SES <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> are conflicting and limited. Patients and methods Between January 2006 and May 2008, a total of 907 <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> were randomized to receive SES or BMS. The primary endpoint was MACCE defined as the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, repeat revascularization and bleeding. Five-year follow-up data were collected by reviewing hospital records, telephone calls and a written questionnaire. Results At 5 years, the rate of MACCE between the SES group and the BMS group was no longer significantly different (33. 3 vs. 39. 3 %, P = 0. 12). The cumulative incidence of death and myocardial infarction was similar in both groups (11. 0 vs. 9. 7 %, P = 0. 51). Repeat revascularization was performed in 21. 1 and 25. 8 % of patients, respectively (P = 0. 12). The rate of very late stent thrombosis (1 - 5 years of follow-up) was very low in both groups (2. 0 vs. 0. 7 %, P = 0. 12). Conclusion The benefits of SES <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> <b>in</b> terms of reducing MACCE faded over time. We found no safety concerns in terms of SES in the long term, with extremely low rates of very late stent thrombosis. (C) 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkin...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} a chronic total occlusion (CTO) in a non-infarct related coronary artery (IRA) on markers of reperfusion, infarct size, and long-term cardiac mortality in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEM!). Background: A concurrent CTO <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> has been associated with impaired left ventricular function and outcome. However, the impact on markers of reperfusion is unknown. Methods: All 1, 071 <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> included <b>in</b> the TAPAS-trial between January 2005 and December 2006 were used for this substudy. Endpoints were the association between a CTO in a non-IRA and myocardial blush grade (MBG) of the IRA, ST-segment elevation resolution (STR), enzymatic infarct size, and clinical outcome. Results: A total of 90 patients (8. 4 %) had a CTO. MBG 0 or 1 occurred more often in the CTO group (34. 2 % versus 20. 6 % (Odds Ratio [OR] 2. 00, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 22 - 3. 23, P = 0. 006)). Incomplete STR occurred more often in the CTO group, (63. 6 % versus 48. 2 % [OR 1. 96, 95 % CI: 1. 22 - 3. 13, P = 0. 005]). Median level of maximal myocardial-band of creatinin kinase (CK-MB) in the CTO group was 75 mu g/l (IQR 28 - 136) and 51 mu g/l (IQR 18 - 97) in the no-CTO group (P = 0. 021).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may cause thrombus dislodgment leading to microvascular function impairment, {{which is a}} negative independent predictor of myocardial function recovery. Compared with conventional stenting, pretreatment with aspiration thrombectomy during primary PCI significantly improves coronary epicardial flow and myocardial tissue perfusion parameters. We sought to evaluate the angiographic findings of two different manual aspiration thrombectomy devices (Diver-Invatec (DI) and Export-Medtronic (EM)) <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing primary angioplasty. METHODS: We randomized 103 <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> referred to our hospital to undergo primary PCI (or = 2, and post-stenting myocardial blush grade (MBG) or = 2 in the two groups. RESULTS: Baseline, clinical, and angiographic preprocedural findings did not differ between the two groups.

40|$|Background Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) {{have been}} {{investigated}} in small studies in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents did not show a clear effect on left ventricular function or clinical outcome, but some studies suggested {{an increased risk of}} thromboembolic events. Methods A systematic literature search in MEDLINE was performed, until December 2012. We included randomized clinical trials investigating the effect of ESAs <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing primary PCI, with >= 30 days of follow-up. The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis after PCI. Secondary end point was all-cause mortality. Results Individual patient data were obtained from 10 of 11 trials, including 97. 3 % (1, 242 / 1, 277) of all patients randomized to control (n = 600) or to ESAs (n = 642). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment allocations. Mean follow-up time was 248 (+/- 131) days. The primary end point occurred in 3. 5 % (20 / 577) in the control group and in 2. 1 % (13 / 610) in the ESA group (hazard ratio for ESAs, 0. 63; 95 % CI [0. 31 - 1. 27]; P =. 20).

40|$|Because {{patients}} with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) {{were excluded from}} early randomized trials, only relatively short-term data from large multicenter studies comparing drug-eluting stents (DES) with bare-metal stents (BMS) are currently available. Unambiguous ascertainment of long-term compliance with thienopyridines is problematic <b>in</b> <b>STEMI,</b> which {{is a matter of}} serious concern (1, 2), and one observational registry suggested higher late (6 months) unadjusted and adjusted mortality rates <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> with a DES compared with those with a BMS (3).

40|$|Drug-eluting stents (DES) {{dramatically}} {{lower rates}} of restenosis in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions. However, their use has extended beyond the initial approved indications into off-label scenarios such as ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Multiple retrospective case series and 10 prospective randomised controlled trials have been published {{on the use of}} DES <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients,</b> and these generally show reduced rates of target vessel revascularisation with a neutral effect on mortality. Three meta-analyses show similar findings with the composite endpoint of death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or re-intervention significantly lower in the DES group, although this was largely driven by a decrease in target vessel revascularisation. These studies also demonstrate that DES use in the setting of STEMI is not associated with increased risk of stent thrombosis compared to bare metal stents. In. summary, current data support the efficacy of DES in reducing restenosis and re-intervention in patients who present with STEMI. From a safety standpoint, the use of DES <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> does not increase the risk of stent thrombosis, and there is no difference in overall mortality.

40|$|Introduction: In {{patients}} who present with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), primary percutaneous coronary intervention {{and the administration}} of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a P 2 Y 12 inhibitor) are recommended. This thesis aimed {{to determine the extent}} to which oral P 2 Y 12 inhibitors (clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor) exert their antiplatelet effect during the acute phase of a STEMI compared to non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Methods: The degree and time-course of platelet inhibition following oral administration of P 2 Y 12 inhibitors was determined in 87 patients from their pharmacokinetic (plasma concentration) and pharmacodynamic (degree of platelet inhibition) profiles at 20 minutes, balloon inflation, 60 and 240 minutes using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, VerifyNow and VASP-phosphorylation assays. Results: <b>In</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients,</b> oral P 2 Y 12 inhibitors do not provide adequate levels of platelet inhibition at the time of angioplasty and have a limited effect at 240 minutes.
