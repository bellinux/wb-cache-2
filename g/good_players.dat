5|$|After an {{unsuccessful}} interview at Liverpool, Shankly moved to manage Grimsby Town in June 1951. He {{said in his}} autobiography that there was greater potential at Grimsby than at Carlisle. His main problems were that Grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons, dropping from the First to the Third Division, and some <b>good</b> <b>players</b> had been transferred before he arrived. But Shankly believed he still had <b>good</b> <b>players</b> {{to work with and}} was able to buy some additional players on the transfer market for low fees.|$|E
5|$|Stengel {{had become}} {{famous for his}} humorous and {{sometimes}} disjointed way of speech while with the Yankees, and these skills of showmanship served the expansion Mets well when they hired him in late 1961. He promoted the team tirelessly, as well as managing it to a 40–120 record, the most losses of any 20th century MLB team. The team finished last all four years he managed it, but was boosted by considerable support from fans. Stengel retired in 1965, and became a fixture at baseball events {{for the rest of}} his life. Although Stengel is sometimes described as one of the great managers in major league history, others have contrasted his success during the Yankee years with his lack of success at other times, and concluded he was only a good manager when given <b>good</b> <b>players.</b> Stengel is remembered as one of the great characters in baseball history.|$|E
5|$|Clough was {{appointed}} as manager at Third Division Brighton & Hove Albion on 1 November 1973, with Taylor joining as his assistant. Just after the pair were appointed, the team lost 4–0 {{at home to}} Walton & Hersham in an FA Cup replay and then 8–2 at home to Bristol Rovers on 1 December. Brighton finished 19th in the final table in the 1973–74 season, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division, and the pair began to rebuild the team by signing Peter Grummitt, Andy Rollings, Ian Mellor, Steve Govier, and Ken Goodewe; Taylor felt that Clough never settled at Brighton however, and {{spent too much time}} away on media commitments. Clough left for Leeds United in July 1974, but Taylor refused to go with Clough as he felt Brighton and club chairman Mike Bamber had treated them well, and so the partnership ended after nine years as Taylor stayed at the Goldstone Ground as sole manager. He went on to sign striker Peter Ward and midfielder Brian Horton, but admitted that both he and Clough were much more effective as a duo; he felt that he had struggled to make the <b>good</b> <b>players</b> he signed play to their full potential whilst feeling that Clough had bought and sold poorly as Leeds manager. He stayed on at the South coast club for a further two seasons, guiding the team to a fourth-place finish in 1975–76, missing promotion by two points. His successor, Alan Mullery, managed to lead the team Taylor left behind to promotion in 1976–77 and then into the top-flight in 1978–79.|$|E

25|$|With the {{resumption}} of the Football League for the 1946–47 season after World War II the club were relegated {{at the end of}} the 1947–48 season and have never returned to this level. Much of the 1950s and 1960s were spent alternating between the Second Division and the Third Division North, later the Third Division. From July 1951 to January 1953 they were managed by Bill Shankly. His main problems were that Grimsby had been relegated twice in recent seasons, dropping from the First to the Third Division, and some <b>good</b> <b>players</b> had been transferred before he arrived.

25|$|After winning Super Bowl II {{after the}} 1967 regular season, the Packers became a losing team {{for much of}} the 1970s and 1980s, only making the playoffs in 1972 and the strike-shortened 1982 season. In {{addition}} to having the reputation of being a poor team, the Packers were unable to attract <b>good</b> <b>players</b> because many did not want to play in Green Bay's cold winter climate {{and the fact that they}} were a small market team.|$|E

Hauritz recovered from his injury to your India the following tour, however bad lucked combined with mediocre bowling at times resulted in a poor series for Hauritz which India won 2–0. There was criticism over his ability against the Indian batsmen, who are notably <b>good</b> <b>players</b> of spin. Ironically Hauritz has a great record against Pakistan who are also considered excellent players of spin.|$|E
25|$|The {{first season}} under Cecchi Gori's {{ownership}} {{was one of}} stabilisation, after which the new chairman started to sign some <b>good</b> <b>players</b> like Brian Laudrup, Stefan Effenberg, Francesco Baiano and, most importantly, Gabriel Batistuta, who became an iconic player for the team during the 1990s. In 1993, however, Cecchi Gori died and was succeeded as chairman by his son, Vittorio. Despite a good start to the season, Cecchi Gori fired the coach, Luigi Radice, after a defeat against Atalanta, and replaced him with Aldo Agroppi. The results were dreadful: Fiorentina fell into {{the bottom half of}} the standings and were relegated on the last day of the season.|$|E

Chargers did pick very <b>good</b> <b>players</b> in Cameron White, JP Duminy, Ishant Sharma, Dale Steyn and skipper Kumar Sangakkara. But at the same time Chargers lost many of Indian players such RP Singh and Rohit Sharma as well as Australians Andrew Symonds and Adam Gilchrist.|$|E

25|$|Homerton CC was {{established}} in 1783. The club had several <b>good</b> <b>players</b> {{and for the next}} ten years it was representative of Essex as a county, the club's name sometimes being interchangeable with that of the county in the scorecards of important matches. Essex cricket faded during the Napoleonic Wars and Hornchurch played only minor matches from 1794. The home ground was initially Langton Park, moving to Grey Towers by 1889. Grey Towers was purchased by the army during the First World War and after using a field in Wingletye Lane the club moved to Queen's Green in 1925, moving to Harrow Lodge Park in 1947.|$|E
25|$|Patronage was {{of vital}} {{importance}} to the growth and development of cricket in the 18th century. It is extremely doubtful if cricket would ever have become a national sport without patronage and gambling. The key figures in the 18th century were the Dukes of Richmond; Edwin Stead; Sir William Gage; Frederick, Prince of Wales; Lord John Sackville; John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset; Sir Horatio Mann; George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea and, into the 19th century, Lord Frederick Beauclerk. They were {{all members of the}} nobility or the gentry, they all played cricket (Beauclerk and, to a lesser degree, Dorset were very <b>good</b> <b>players)</b> and they all gambled on matches.|$|E

500|$|One {{player who}} could have taken part in the 1709 match was William Bedle (1680–1768), of Dartford, who is the {{earliest}} great player whose name has been recorded.

500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was happy}} with his players after they had come from behind to win the match: [...] "It was a {{difficult}} game.

To score three goals is not easy. I can say that we are very happy now with this trophy. Now is the time to enjoy our victory." [...] With five days of the transfer window left, Benítez refused to speculate on whether Liverpool would sign Michael Owen, stating, [...] "I like <b>good</b> <b>players,</b> {{we have a lot of}} them here." ...|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's {{recovery}} {{depended on}} new players being acquired and, in his autobiography, Shankly recalled the struggles {{he had with}} the board to make them realise the club's potential {{and the need to}} spend money on <b>good</b> <b>players.</b> He said there were times when he felt like walking out. He found a valuable ally in Eric Sawyer, of the Littlewoods pools organisation, who joined the board not long after Shankly's appointment and shared Shankly's vision of Liverpool as the best club in England. At one board meeting in 1961 when Shankly insisted the club make offers for two players in Scotland, the board's initial response was that [...] "we can't afford them" [...] but Sawyer stepped in and said: [...] "We can't afford not to buy them".|$|E
