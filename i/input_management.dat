40|$|Production is of {{significant}} {{importance for the}} social welfare and economic growth in societies worldwide. In Europe, more than 30 % of all job opportunities {{are related to the}} manufacturing industry. Improvements of material flows in production are of extra importance for reducing the system losses and increasing the robustness of production systems. Unfortunately, the most powerful tools for analyzing dynamic aspects are associated with extensive data requirements and, thus, inefficient procedures for keeping models up-to-date. This thesis addresses the <b>input</b> data <b>management</b> procedure for one such tool, namely discrete event simulation (DES). The purpose of the thesis is to enable daily use of DES to support production engineers in their work with increasing efficiency, sustainability and robustness of production systems. The aim is to reduce the time-consumption for <b>input</b> data <b>management</b> and thereby facilitate the supply of recent production data to DES models. The thesis is divided into two parts, treated as interrelated studies, addressing one research question (RQ) each. Part One (RQ 1), mapping the industrial state-of-the-art of <b>input</b> data <b>management,</b> is mainly based on qualitative methods including interviews and questionnaires with DES practitioners. The results show that collection of raw data, identification of available data sources, and data analysis and preparation are the three most time-consuming activities. There is still limited use of automatic support systems and the data are often manually collected, processed and supplied to models by means of spreadsheet interfaces. Findings in Part One also show that automated connections to external databases are important for future sustainability analyses using DES. Part Two (RQ 2), proposing and evaluating an approach for automated <b>input</b> data <b>management,</b> is mainly based on the analysis of existing industrial data sources (archive analysis). This review aims to identify the functionalities necessary to automatically transform production data (raw data) to information for a DES model. A demonstrator, called the GDM-Tool, is developed and tested in three independent case studies. The results show that the proposed automated approach reduces the time-consumption for <b>input</b> data <b>management</b> by approximately 75 %. There are still difficulties in <b>input</b> data <b>management</b> for DES, partly due to the limited access to detailed production data. Therefore, the author recommends that industrial and academic partners increase efforts necessary to facilitate continuous raw data collection and, by extension, also automated data processing. In cases where enough data are available, the proposed solution (RQ 2) enables more frequent updates of DES models and provides production engineers with a powerful tool for increasing efficiency of production systems on a daily basis...|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{long-term}} turfgrass management on soil nematode community and nutrient pools Lawns provide many {{benefits to the}} environment and society, such as minimizing soil erosion, contributing to carbon sequestration, reducing run-off and leaching, and providing spaces for recreation. Conventional lawn management relies heavily on fertilizers and pesticides, which may impair natural ecological processes in the lawn ecosystem and are also perceived to be sources of environmental pollution. However, due to extensive root growth and the continuous addition of clippings and nutrient inputs, lawn ecosystems are rich in organic matter and thus have high microbial biomass and activity, which can rapidly degrade chemical pesticides. Thus, we hypothesized that the application of herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides to turfgrass will not significantly affect soil microbial biomass or food web status. Nematodes are now widely used as bio-indicators for soil ecosystems as they function at almost every trophic level and react rapidly to contaminants and disturbances. A new model integrating nematode feeding groups and the colonizer-persister scale into a matrix classification of functional guilds can be used to assess soil food web structure and health. Enrichment Index (EI) and Structure Index (SI) are the two key components of this model. Based on this model, we hypothesized that the amount of nitrogen fertilizer input will affect soil nematode community and food web health. Due to the fact that organic management practices are becoming attractive, we also tested whether organic <b>input</b> <b>management</b> improves turf soil ecosystem conditions over inorganic <b>input</b> <b>management...</b>|$|E

Objectives were to disentangle environmental opportunities by disaggregating herd effects into causal inputs. Average ME milk production was 8640 kg/lactation for the 183 Friesian herds containing 35 lactating cows and 10 dry cows. Seventy-one Brown Swiss herds averaged 6443 kg ME milk from 25 lactating and 10 dry cows. For Friesian (Brown Swiss) herds 10 (11) management practices affected milking performance and 9 (8) practices influenced somatic cell concentration (P< 0. 05). Multilevel analysis and herd clustering procedures differentiated low from high opportunity herd environments but altering relative weightings among management practices did not further discriminate them. This clustering methodology helps ensure unbiased estimation of <b>management</b> <b>input</b> effects and could help target priority management substitutions and technical support priorities in dairy extension programs.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigated}} the effects of different <b>management</b> <b>inputs</b> (fertiliser and seed) and grazing patterns on plant biodiversity in a short tussock grassland with a strong Hieracium pilosella component. Cover abundance of vascular and non-vascular plants and environmental variables were measured in 32 10 × 10 -m plots located in five blocks with different management treatments. Ordination of the floristic data separated the block with the highest <b>management</b> <b>inputs</b> from other blocks. Several adventive species were significantly more abundant in this block, while several native species were either absent or uncommon, but were significantly more abundant in other study blocks. H. pilosella was significantly more abundant in blocks with lower <b>management</b> <b>inputs.</b> Diversity was significantly higher in the block with the highest <b>management</b> <b>inputs.</b> The native tussock Poa colensoi had significantly greater cover abundance while Festuca novae-zelandiae tussocks were significantly taller in this block. Our results suggest that high <b>management</b> <b>inputs</b> reduce the abundance of H. pilosella and diversity of native species, but increase the abundance of other adventive species and the cover and vigour of native tussocks. Our results highlight an interesting management conundrum for short tussock grasslands. No-input management is {{likely to result in}} a decline in native biodiversity, as well as production values, as H. pilosella mats deplete soil nutrients and restrict regeneration of native species.

In the present study, we evaluated the nutrient and nutraceutical properties of 2 old and 6 modern durum wheat varieties grown under low input agricultural management. Considering the lack of available data on the adaptability of existing durum wheat varieties to the low input and organic sectors, the research aimed at providing a complete description of the investigated genotypes, considering the agronomic performance as well as the nutrient and phytochemical composition. The experimental trials were carried out at the same location (Bologna, Northern Italy) for two consecutive growing seasons (2006 / 2007, 2007 / 2008). No clear distinction between old and modern varieties was observed in terms of grain yield (mean values ranging from 2. 5 to 4. 0 t/ha), highlighting that the divergence in productivity, normally found between dwarf and non-dwarf genotypes, is strongly reduced when they are cropped under low <b>input</b> <b>management.</b> All durum wheat varieties presented high protein levels and, in addition, provided remarkable amounts of phytochemicals such as dietary fibre, polyphenols, flavonoids and carotenoids.
