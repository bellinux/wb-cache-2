5|$|A <b>keystone</b> {{species is}} {{a species that}} is {{connected}} to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. <b>Keystone</b> species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a <b>keystone</b> species holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a <b>keystone</b> species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|Neighborhoods in the {{vicinity}} of Eddy Creek include the <b>Keystone</b> Industrial Park, the <b>Keystone</b> Sanitary Landfill, and LaCapra Stone & Supply. It is estimated that there is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed. According to a 1992 report, development in an area near the creek would have little adverse impact on the creek.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are {{commonly}} cited {{as an example}} of a <b>keystone</b> species; because, they limit the density of sea urchins that feed on kelp. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure. Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the Steller's sea cow (Hydrodamalis gigas). While the <b>keystone</b> species concept has been used extensively as a conservation tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a <b>keystone</b> role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that <b>keystone</b> species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the <b>keystone</b> species model can be applied.|$|E

5|$|The Pennsylvanian is the {{replacement}} of the former <b>Keystone</b> service between New York and Pittsburgh. Prior to Amtrak, the route was known as the Duquesne, named after Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh, and operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Duquesne had a long history, finally becoming a daily New YorkPittsburgh train on October 25, 1959, numbered 16 eastbound and 25 westbound. With the start of Amtrak operations on May 1, 1971, the Duquesne was renamed the <b>Keystone</b> and renumbered 42 westbound and 43 eastbound with the first Amtrak timetable on November 14, 1971. The <b>Keystone</b> was discontinued on April 30, 1972.|$|E

This highway continues eastward along a peninsula into Lake <b>Keystone.</b> Here, the highway serves as the southern limit of Westport and Mule Barn, which remains an incorporated town despite having a population of zero. The freeway turns southeast, briefly entering Westport before crossing Lake <b>Keystone</b> into Osage County. US-64 and US-412 run through Osage County for just under , cutting across {{a corner of the}} county before entering Tulsa County.|$|E

50|$|Harold W. Peel (born June 21, 1879) was {{an early}} {{professional}} ice hockey player with the Pittsburgh <b>Keystones</b> of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League. He {{was a member of}} the <b>Keystones</b> 1902 WPHL championship team. He was also one of the first openly professional hockey players. In 1902 Peel disclosed that he was paid $35 a week to play for the <b>Keystones.</b> This was a violation of the team's amateur status. As a result, both Canadian and U.S. officials disallowed all amateur teams to play against the <b>Keystones</b> and Peel's amateur status was revoked by the Ontario Hockey Association. He issued two appeals that were rejected on December 10, 1903 and again on November 30, 1904.|$|R

5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a <b>keystone</b> species, as it is assumed, through {{controlling}} the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} <b>keystone</b> predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the <b>keystone</b> predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E

5|$|Though Tunis never {{considered}} himself a children's writer, {{all but one}} of his twenty-four books were published for juveniles; their success helped create the juvenile fiction book market in the 1940s. Books like Iron Duke (1938), All American (1942) and <b>Keystone</b> Kids (1943) were well received by readers and critics. Iron Duke received the New York Herald Tribune Spring Book Festival Award for best juvenile novel and was named a The Horn Book Magazine Best Book. The Child Study Association of America gave its Golden Scroll Award to <b>Keystone</b> Kids.|$|E
5|$|Elizabethtown is an Amtrak {{railroad}} {{station on the}} <b>Keystone</b> Corridor in Elizabethtown, Lancaster County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. The station is served by Amtrak's <b>Keystone</b> Service between New York City and Harrisburg, and by the Pennsylvanian between New York and Pittsburgh. The station was built in 1915 by the Pennsylvania Railroad to replace another that had been built in 1900. The station building was closed in 1977 by Amtrak. The title to the building {{was transferred to the}} borough of Elizabethtown in 1998, and it was leased back to Amtrak. From 2009 to 2011, the station underwent a 21-month renovation to make it handicapped-accessible.|$|E

5|$|The Pennsylvanian is a {{once a day}} {{replacement}} of the <b>Keystone</b> service between New York and Harrisburg, offering Business Class seating as an upgrade to the coach-only seating on <b>Keystone</b> trains. Prior to Amtrak, the route {{was known as the}} Duquesne, named after Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh, and operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The Pennsylvanian began on April 27, 1980, as a state-supported daylight train between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with connecting service to New York. The train was extended to New York in 1983. Between November 1998 and January 2003, Amtrak shifted the endpoints west to Chicago and Philadelphia, providing daylight service to Cleveland, Ohio. In 2003 the Pennsylvanian reverted to the PittsburghNew York schedule.|$|E
40|$|The stress {{derivative}} {{technique for}} control of <b>keystoning</b> deformation in under-integrated finte elements is based on expansion of the stress in a Taylor series about the element center and retention of additional terms beyond the constant stress term. It has the advantage over other control techniques that <b>keystoning</b> resistance is provided by actual rather than artificial material properties. Application of this technique to the quadrilateral ring elements used for modelling solids of revolution subjected to axisymmetric loads is described.

5|$|The {{discontinuance}} of the Atlantic City Express in 1995, and {{the arrival}} of the California Cars in 1996 and the Surfliner railcars in 2000–2002, lessened the need for the Metroliner-based cab cars. However, the Vermonter corridor service began using them when a reverse move was added between Springfield, Massachusetts and Palmer, Massachusetts in 1995. The later cab cars, and some of the earlier conversions, were retired in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 2007, six of the 9600-series cab cars were brought out of retirement to support additional frequencies on the newly re-electrified <b>Keystone</b> Service. After the Vermonters backup move was eliminated in 2014, the ex-Metroliner cab cars have been used primarily on the <b>Keystone</b> Service and New Haven–Springfield Shuttle.|$|E
