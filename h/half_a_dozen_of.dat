5|$|Before the {{evacuation}} of the St Kildian inhabitants, these sheep were farmed. However, when the St Kilda archipelago's human inhabitants were evacuated in 1930, the sheep of Hirta were also removed and in 1932 they were replaced by Soays, which still live there {{as well as on}} Soay itself. Meanwhile, the remaining sheep on Boreray were left to become feral; these became the only survivors of the crofters' sheep, {{and one of the few}} surviving descendants of the Dunface. This means that they are the original, unmodified sheep that used to be farmed on the island. In the 1970s <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> them were exported to form the basis of a breeding population on the mainland, but the majority of Borerays still remain on the island.|$|E

500|$|In 1972 Elizabeth Steele's {{study of}} Walpole was published. Much shorter than Hart-Davis's biography, at 178 pages to his 503, it dealt mainly with the novels, and aimed [...] "to show {{the sources of}} Hugh Walpole's success as a writer during the thirty-five years and fifty books of his busy career". Steele {{concentrated}} on <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> Walpole's best books, each illustrating aspects of his writing, under the headings [...] "Acolyte", [...] "Artist", [...] "Witness", [...] "Evangelist", [...] "Critic" [...] and [...] "Romanticist".

Hooper {{had not seen the}} musical, so watched a performance of it in London's West End. Adapted from the musical, the film starred Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, Amanda Seyfried, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Eddie Redmayne. As the film required the actors to sing and dance, they were auditioned in front of Hooper, producers and composers. The role of Fantine was hugely contested; Hooper said, [...] "It was like <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> the biggest female movie stars on the planet wanted to play the role".|$|E
500|$|Prices of durians are {{relatively}} high {{as compared with}} other fruits. For example, in Singapore, the strong demand for high quality cultivars such as the D24(Sultan), and Musang King (Mao Shan Wang) has resulted in typical retail prices of between S$8 to S$15 (US$5 to US$10) per kilogram of whole fruit. With an average weight of about , a durian fruit would therefore cost about S$12 to S$22 (US$8 to US$15). The edible portion of the fruit, known as the aril and usually {{referred to as the}} [...] "flesh" [...] or [...] "pulp", only accounts for about 15–30% of the mass of the entire fruit. Many consumers in Singapore are nevertheless quite willing to spend up to around S$75 (US$50) on a single purchase of about <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> the favoured fruit to be shared by family members.|$|E

The Beverly Hills Hotel underwent significant renovation in the late forties when the porte cochere was expanded and painted in stripes. In 1947 Courtright opened the Crystal Room and the Lanai Restaurant, later called The Coterie. The building was first painted its famous pink color in 1948 to match the country club style of the period, and it became known as [...] "The Pink Palace". The following year, architect Paul Williams added the Crescent Wing. The Fountain Coffee Shop also opened at this time.|$|E

Eventually the oxen calm down, but {{on the way back}} home the wolf jumps into their path. The wolf asks where the husbandman is driving them, since they are not his, to which he confirms that they are and asks why he is being stopped since he never offended the wolf before. The wolf reminds the husbandman of his earlier declaration, to which he replies that a man may say things that do not mean anything. They argue, and the husbandman reproaches the wolf for not having a witness; in response, he produces the fox. The creature takes it upon himself to mediate the dispute, and takes each aside in turn. To the husbandman he says that he would lend his expertise to help him {{were it not for the}} [...] "grit coist and expence" [...] of doing so; the husbandman offers him <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> the fattest hens he has, to which the fox acedes and goes off.

Marino's mother had always doubted the identification of her son because clothing found upon the body was inconsistent with what her son had worn when she last saw him. In addition, the dental X-ray conducted upon the victim identified as Michael Marino had revealed the victim had all of his second molars, whereas a dental X-ray conducted upon Marino in March 1976 revealed one molar had not erupted.

2500|$|Curtis Hanson {{had read}} <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> James Ellroy's books before L.A. Confidential and {{was drawn to}} its characters, not the plot. He said, [...] "What hooked me on them was that, as I met them, one after the other, I didn't like them - but as I {{continued}} reading, I started to care about them." [...] Ellroy's novel also made Hanson think about Los Angeles and provided him {{with an opportunity to}} [...] "set a movie at a point in time when the whole dream of Los Angeles, from that apparently golden era of the '20s and '30s, was being bulldozed." [...] Screenwriter Brian Helgeland was originally signed to Warner Bros. to write a Viking film with director Uli Edel and then worked on an unproduced modern-day King Arthur story. Helgeland was a long-time fan of Ellroy's novels. When he heard that Warner Bros. had acquired the rights to L.A. Confidential in 1990, he lobbied to script the film. However, at the time, the studio was only talking to well-known screenwriters. When he finally did get a meeting, it was canceled two days before it was to occur.|$|E

2500|$|Heath {{were drawn}} to play Sheffield Wednesday {{in the second round}} of the Cup, and had choice of venue, but were quick to accept an offer of £200 to switch the game to Wednesday's Olive Grove ground, [...] "a {{telegram}} to that effect being posted on the front of the stand at the conclusion of Saturday's match". Wednesday won the toss and chose to play with the benefit of the strong wind at their backs. They took a first-half lead, but Small Heath held their own. The play became increasingly rough, the Sheffield Independent suggesting that [...] "several of the Heathens began to use their weight mercilessly", and Wednesday's claim for a penalty kick after one of the visiting backs handled the ball over the crossbar was turned down by the referee. Wednesday players Duncan Gemmell and Richardson were sent off, for kicking and striking an opponent respectively, but despite the numerical disadvantage their team increased their lead late on. The referee, Mr Widdowson, needed police protection from spectators throwing mud and other missiles as he left the field, though the Independents correspondent suggested he had brought the problem on himself by failing to apply [...] "a little more severity when the roughness first commenced". In consequence, the two dismissed players were each suspended for one week (such a lenient punishment perhaps in recognition [...] "that it was really six of one and <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>of</b> the other in the matter of rough play"), the Olive Grove ground was closed for two weeks, and Ted Devey, the player struck by Richardson, was asked to explain his conduct during the match.|$|E
