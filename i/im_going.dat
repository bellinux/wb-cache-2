The original post included a link to Westley Sullivan's Facebook profile, which has since been taken down, and a screenshot of a post which said [...] "if fairview isnt closed tomorrow <b>im</b> <b>going</b> to blow it up", referring to Sullivan's high school, Fairview High School, in Boyd County, Kentucky. A few anonymous individuals went to Sullivan's Facebook profile and found his address, phone number, school ID number, school schedule and teachers, and other personal information. Information like his teachers and ID number had been posted directly, and the more personal information like his address was found in the EXIF data of some of the pictures posted on his profile. These individuals then contacted Fairview school officials and the local police department, as well as the FBI. The next day it was learned that police had arrested Sullivan in his home and he had been charged with 2nd degree terroristic threatening, a Class D felony in Kentucky.|$|E
