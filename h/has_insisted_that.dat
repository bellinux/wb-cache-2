5|$|Chase's {{decision}} {{to end the}} last episode abruptly with just a black screen was controversial. While Chase <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> {{it was not his}} intention to stir controversy, the ambiguity over the ending and question of whether Tony was murdered has continued for years after the finale's original broadcast and has spawned numerous websites devoted to finding out his true intention.|$|E
5|$|One vocalist whose {{status is}} disputed, {{both inside and}} outside Black Sabbath, is Christian evangelist and former Joshua frontman, Jeff Fenholt. Fenholt <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he was a singer in Black Sabbath between January and May 1985. Tony Iommi has never {{confirmed}} this. Fenholt gives a detailed account of his time with Iommi and Sabbath in Garry Sharpe-Young's book Sabbath Bloody Sabbath: The Battle for Black Sabbath.|$|E
5|$|Larry tells Darrin that Mr. Brockway <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Darrin {{be removed}} from the account. Darrin and Samantha host a Christmas party which Larry, Keith, and Dorothy attend. When Mr. Brockway arrives, he sees Darrin and Dorothy {{standing}} next to each other and assumes they are married to each other. When Mr. Brockway realizes his mistake, and that Darrin is instead married to Samantha, Mr. Brockway tells Larry that he is willing to allow Darrin back on the account. After discovering that Mr. Brockway initially was unwilling because he thought Darrin was married to an African-American woman, Larry rejects Mr. Brockway's offer. Mr. Brockway expresses disbelief that anyone would reject such a lucrative account. Through witchcraft, Samantha causes Mr. Brockway to see everyone in the room, including himself, as having black skin. On Christmas Day, while the Wilsons are visiting the Stephens, Mr. Brockway arrives, apologizes for his previous actions, and repents of his racism. Samantha invites Mr. Brockway to join them for Christmas dinner, and he accepts.|$|E

25|$|The EU {{has been}} more {{critical}} of Israel and more supportive of the Palestinians than the US. The general position of the EU is that a Palestinian state {{should be based on}} the 1967 borders with land swaps, Jerusalem should be divided and become the capital of both states, and a negotiated settlement be found for the Palestinian refugee issue, although member states have sometimes been divided on these issues. However, all EU states universally consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law. The EU <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> it will not recognize any changes to the 1967 borders other than those agreed between the parties. Israel's settlement program has, thus, led to tensions. The most difficult of these issues, however, is Jerusalem. Israel <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the city will remain its undivided capital, and is fiercely opposed to its re-division. Israel does not regard Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem as settlements, while the EU does. East Jerusalem has been a de facto part of Israel following Israel's unilateral annexation of the area, while the EU, {{along with the rest of}} the international community, regards it as occupied territory subject to negotiations. The EU has frequently criticized Jewish construction in East Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|The {{authorities}} {{have refused to}} grant a permit to Bersih to hold the rally at Padang Merdeka in Kuching and advised Bersih to seek alternative venues. Bersih <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the rally in Padang Merdeka will go ahead despite the government's refusal {{to give them a}} permit, otherwise they have suggested the rally would be Song Kheng Hai recreational ground or Jubilee Ground Stadium. Bersih has been given the approval by the authorities to hold the Kuching rally at Song Kheng Hai field at Song Kheng Hai Food and Recreational Centre.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time this was happening, Gilani resumed work as a DEA {{informant}} in New York City and participated in an undercover operation that reportedly led to the seizure of one kilo of heroin. Yet despite working for a U.S. government agency, Gilani actively raised money and recruited new members for LeT, a group that swore allegiance with Al-Qaeda. Gilani would later testify that he discussed his views regarding Kashmir—the focus of LeT's militant activities —with his DEA handlers. The DEA <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> it was unaware of Gilani's political and religious radicalization.|$|E

25|$|The {{most recent}} {{expansion}} {{occurred in the}} summer of 2017, with Las Vegas, Nevada, gaining the league's 31st team, the Vegas Golden Knights. Bettman later explained that the NHL's new divisional alignment precluded the adding of more franchises in the Eastern Time Zone {{at least for the time}} being. As of 2017, Bettman is widely believed to be waiting for a viable franchise proposal to emerge from Seattle or some other market outside the Eastern Time Zone to balance the divisions, although the commissioner <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> further expansion is not on the League's short-term agenda.|$|E
25|$|Gilani {{managed to}} beat his {{addiction}} to heroin, {{but was still}} involved in the drug trade. In early 1997, Gilani was arrested with another man in a DEA sting operation {{when he tried to}} smuggle heroin into the country from Pakistan. Gilani quickly offered his services as a confidential informant to the DEA. In January 1998, the agency sent him to Pakistan to dispel suspicions amongst his partners about his prior absence, and to gain intelligence on the country's heroin trafficking networks. According to the DEA, Gilani's participation led to five arrests and the seizure of 2½ kilos of heroin. The DEA <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Gilani's 1998 trip to Pakistan was the only one paid for by the agency.|$|E
25|$|Gorbachev's {{policies}} of glasnost ("openness") and perestroika ("restructuring") and his reorientation of Soviet strategic aims {{contributed to the}} end of the Cold War. Under this program, the role of the Communist Party in governing the state was removed from the constitution, which inadvertently led to crisis-level political instability with a surge of regional nationalist and anti-communist activism culminating in the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Gorbachev later expressed regret for his failure to save the USSR, though he <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> his policies were not failures but rather were vitally necessary reforms which were sabotaged and exploited by opportunists. He was awarded the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1990 and the Harvey Prize in 1992, as well as honorary doctorates from various universities.|$|E

25|$|To address {{concerns}} that its enrichment program may be diverted to non-peaceful uses, Iran {{has offered to}} place additional restrictions on its enrichment program including, for example, ratifying the Additional Protocol to allow more stringent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, operating the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz as a multinational fuel center with the participation of foreign representatives, renouncing plutonium reprocessing and immediately fabricating all enriched uranium into reactor fuel rods. Iran's offer to open its uranium enrichment program to foreign private and public participation mirrors suggestions of an IAEA expert committee which was formed to investigate the methods {{to reduce the risk}} that sensitive fuel cycle activities could contribute to national nuclear weapons capabilities. Some non-governmental U.S. experts have endorsed this approach. The United States <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Iran must meet the demands of the UN Security Council to suspend its enrichment program.|$|E
25|$|In late 2013, it was {{reported}} that Outkast would reunite at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2014. This was later confirmed on January 8, 2014, when it was officially announced that the duo would headline the festival on April 11 and 18. It was later announced on January 13, 2014 that Outkast would be performing at more than 40 festivals around the world throughout {{the spring and summer of}} 2014 to celebrate their 20th anniversary, including one of the largest festivals in the UK, Bestival. Despite rumors, Big Boi <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the duo are not currently working on a new album together. Outkast returned to Atlanta for their #ATLast homecoming shows over the weekend of September 26, 2014, selling out within minutes of tickets going on sale. The shows had a large variety of openers, ranging from R singer Janelle Monáe and rapper/rock artist Kid Cudi to rappers 2 Chainz, Future, Bun B, and Childish Gambino. Outkast's Dungeon Family associates Sleepy Brown and Big Gipp also appeared onstage with the duo, rapping and singing on their respective songs.|$|E
25|$|A {{referendum}} held in Catalonia in 2014 {{indicated that}} 92% of the 2.3 million voters supported Catalonia's transformation into a state. 80% of the 2.3 million voters expressed their preference that this {{state would be}} independent. Estimates for the turnout as published by the news media ranged from 37.0%, as given in The Economist and El País among others, to 41.6% as per the Catalan government's preliminary data. On 9 November 2015, Catalan lawmakers approved a plan for secession from Spain by 2017 with a majority vote 72 to 63. The plan was suspended by the Spanish Constitutional Court, but the Catalan government <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> it will complete the plan despite the suspension. On 9 June 2017, the Catalan government announced that an independence referendum would be held 1 October 2017. However, Spanish courts had declared the referendum to be illegal, and the Public Prosecutor's Office of Catalonia ordered the seizure of paraphernalia related to the referendum, including ballots, ballot boxes, promotional materials, and websites. On 20 September 2017, eleven days prior to the referendum, the Civil Guard mounted Operation Anubis to raid the offices of government ministries and detain officials involved in the referendum, which resulted in large protests by independence supporters.|$|E

25|$|On November 8, 1997, one {{day before}} Survivor Series, McMahon met with Pat Patterson and Michaels {{in a hotel room}} in Montreal and planned the screwjob. It is unclear how many people knew of the {{impending}} screwjob, but McMahon's close aides Gerald Brisco and Sgt. Slaughter had been involved in the planning. Jim Ross <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he did not know the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart's family, thought he was involved. In a radio interview, Ross also confirmed that Jerry Lawler also did not know that the screwjob would take place. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold {{at a time when the}} referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested. The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels' foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and start to make the count, but Hart would kick out, setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.|$|E

500|$|In his {{historical}} {{writings and}} memoirs, Kennan laments {{in great detail}} the failings of democratic foreign policy makers {{and those of the}} United States in particular. According to Kennan, when American policymakers suddenly confronted the Cold War, they had inherited little more than rationale and rhetoric [...] "utopian in expectations, legalistic in concept, moralistic in [...] demand it seemed to place on others, and self-righteous in the degree of high-mindedness and rectitude... to ourselves". The source of the problem is the force of public opinion, a force that is inevitably unstable, unserious, subjective, emotional, and simplistic. Kennan <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. public can only be united behind a foreign policy goal on the [...] "primitive level of slogans and jingoistic ideological inspiration".|$|E

500|$|At busy {{times there}} was {{significant}} delay at the payment booths when these existed. There are numerous junctions {{on either side}} of the crossing, and because it is not under motorway restrictions, a high proportion of local traffic mixes with long distance traffic, for example travelling from the North and Midlands onwards to Continental Europe. In 2004, a BBC survey reported that the crossing was [...] "the most stressful section of the M25" [...] while in 2009, the crossing was listed in a Royal Automobile Club report as the fourth most congested road in Britain. Though Highways England have reported greatly improved journey times since automatic charging was introduced, Gareth Johnson MP claims otherwise and <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the Lower Thames Crossing, along with improved signing around Dartford, are better options to reduce congestion. In 2015, he said the crossing was Britain's worst stretch of motorway.|$|E
500|$|When Caged Bird was {{published}} in 1969, Angelou was hailed as {{a new kind of}} memoirist, one of the first African-American women who was able to publicly discuss her personal life. Up to that point, Black women writers were marginalized {{to the point that they}} were unable to present themselves as central characters. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called Caged Bird [...] "a work of art that eludes description", <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for African-American autobiography as a whole. Als insisted that Caged Bird marked one of the first times that a Black autobiographer could, as Als put it, [...] "write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense". [...] Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized as a respected spokesperson for blacks and women. Caged Bird made her [...] "without a doubt... America's most visible black woman autobiographer". Although Als considers Caged Bird an important contribution to the increase of Black feminist writings in the 1970s, he attributes its success less to its originality than to [...] "its resonance in the prevailing Zeitgeist" [...] of its time, at the end of the American Civil Rights movement. Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, freed many other women writers to [...] "open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world".|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow <b>has</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he is not concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job {{is not to be}} palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is not that big of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E
