5|$|Scaly-breasted munias have {{variable}} competitive {{behaviors that}} allow them to exploit scarce resources. There are two foraging alternatives: producers that make the food available and scroungers that steal food found by the producers. Studies show that these choices lead to a stable equilibrium within a group. When individuals are free to choose between producer and scrounger, frequency dependent selection results in a stable mixture of both behaviors where each receives similar payoff. Studies indicate that <b>if</b> <b>most</b> of the population consists of producers, then scrounging behavior is favored by natural selection because there is plenty of food to steal. On the other hand, <b>if</b> <b>most</b> birds exhibit scrounging then the competition for stealing is so great that producing is favored.|$|E
5|$|By 1924, the {{newspaper}} {{had a good}} circulation but was losing money because of low advertising revenues. Vanderbilt sought help from his parents, and they agreed to help <b>if</b> <b>most</b> authority went to their hand-picked manager, Harvey Johnson. His father poured {{over a million dollars}} into {{the newspaper}} in 1924–1925, but Johnson's involvement led to a rightward shift in the newspaper, which alienated many readers. In April 1926, Johnson concluded that the Illustrated Daily News and the two other newspapers that Vanderbilt had founded in other cities could survive if $300,000 more were invested in them; however, the elder Vanderbilt refused to provide any more money. A petition for receivership was filed on May 3, 1926.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>most</b> of the Sea Harriers {{had been}} lost, the GR.3s would have {{replaced}} them in air patrol duties, {{even though the}} Harrier GR.3 was not designed for air defence operations; as such the GR.3s quickly had their outboard weapons pylons modified to take air-to-air Sidewinder missiles. From 10 to 24 May 1982, prior to British forces landing in the Falklands, a detachment of three GR.3s provided air defence for Ascension Island until three F-4 Phantom IIs arrived {{to take on this}} responsibility. During the Falklands War, the greatest threats to the Harriers were deemed to be surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and small arms fire from the ground. In total, four Harrier GR.3s and six Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire, accidents, or mechanical failure. More than 2,000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict—equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The worst-hit {{area was}} in Varna's low-lying {{district}} of Asparuhovo, where dozens of houses were swept away and streets were virtually unrecognizable due to piles of mangled cars and debris. At least 11 people were initially confirmed killed in Asparuhovo, {{with at least}} two others missing. Much of the area remained without electricity for more than 24 hours before official restored it in the afternoon of June 20.

On June 23 emergency services located the body of a 3-year-old girl in the ruins of a house in Asparuhovo, raising the death toll in Varna to 12. A six-year-old boy remained missing and was presumed dead. His body was discovered on June 26, bringing the final death toll from Asparuhovo up to 13.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of CSCs is under debate, because many studies found no cells with their specific characteristics. Cancer cells must {{be capable of}} continuous proliferation and self-renewal to retain the many mutations required for carcinogenesis and to sustain {{the growth of a}} tumor, since differentiated cells (constrained by the Hayflick Limit) cannot divide indefinitely. For therapeutic consideration, <b>if</b> <b>most</b> tumor cells are endowed with stem cell properties, targeting tumor size directly is a valid strategy. If they are a small minority, targeting them may be more effective. Another debate is over the origin of CSCs - whether from disregulation of normal stem cells or from a more specialized population that acquired the ability to self-renew (which is related to the issue of stem cell plasticity). Confounding this debate is the discovery that many cancer cells demonstrate a Phenotypic plasticity under therapeutic challenge, altering their transcriptomes to a more stem-like state to escape destruction.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, we {{know that}} Praetextatus' family was ancient and noble, and {{therefore}} he possessed a network of relationships {{with other members of}} the senatorial aristocracy, a network that was used also to gain advantages. His acquaintances included Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, his father Lucius Aurelius Avianius Symmachus, Virius Nicomachus Flavianus and probably the senators Volusius Venustus and Minervius. An example of this network of relationships is the very wedding between Praetextatus and his wife Aconia Fabia Paulina, celebrated around 344 (they had been married for 40 years in 384); Paulina, in fact, was the daughter of Fabius Aconius Catullinus Philomathius, Praefectus urbi in 342–344 and Consul in 349. They had at least one son, recalled in the funeral eulogy and the author of an inscription in honour of his father, dated to little time after his death and found in their home on the Aventine. Even <b>if</b> <b>most</b> historians identify the commissioner of the inscription with a son, this could be also a daughter, maybe the Praetextata cited by Jerome. Finally, Vettius Agorius Basilius Mavortius, Consul in 527 and with an interest in literature that Praetextatus had, could have been his great-grandson.|$|E

500|$|Allopatric {{speciation}} {{suggests that}} species with large central populations are stabilized by their large volume {{and the process}} of gene flow. New and even beneficial mutations are diluted by the population's large size and are unable to reach fixation, due to such factors as constantly changing environments. If this is the case, then the transformation of whole lineages should be rare, as the fossil record indicates.

In addition, pressure from natural selection is especially intense, as peripheral isolated populations exist at the outer edges of ecological tolerance. <b>If</b> <b>most</b> evolution happens in these rare instances of allopatric speciation then evidence of gradual evolution in the fossil record should be rare.

Bennett, who wrote much of the newspaper himself, [...] "perfected the fresh, pointed prose practiced in the French press at its best".

500|$|Both the Eastern and the Western churches ordained that feast should {{alternate}} with fast. In most of Europe, Fridays were fast days, and fasting {{was observed}} on various other days and periods, including Lent and Advent. Meat, and animal {{products such as}} milk, cheese, butter and eggs, were not allowed, only fish. The fast was intended to mortify the body and invigorate the soul, and also to remind the faster of Christ's sacrifice for humanity. The intention was not to portray certain foods as unclean, but rather to teach a spiritual lesson in self-restraint through abstention. During particularly severe fast days, the number of daily meals was also reduced to one. Even <b>if</b> <b>most</b> people respected these restrictions and usually made penance when they violated them, there were also numerous ways of circumventing them, a conflict of ideals and practice summarized by writer Bridget Ann Henisch: ...|$|E

500|$|There {{are only}} four other known survivals, secular or religious, of basse taille enamel on gold, one the small Salting Reliquary, {{also in the}} British Museum, and none as fine as the cup. The [...] "King John Cup" [...] in King's Lynn, of ca. 1340, silver-gilt with {{transparent}} enamel, is {{the best example of}} basse-taille work probably made in England; the metalwork expert Herbert Maryon describes this and the Royal Gold Cup as the [...] "two examples of outstanding merit, unsurpassed in any collection." [...] However it is unclear <b>if</b> <b>most</b> of the enamel at King's Lynn is original. The closest comparison to the Royal Gold Cup is perhaps the silver-gilt Mérode Cup of about 1400, which is the only surviving medieval example of plique á jour enamel, a difficult technique which creates a see-through effect like stained glass. A silver-gilt cup in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam of before 1376 has no enamels or gems, and a different shape, but offers an interesting comparison as it has a tripod stand with winged grotesques as legs, a short stem, and the cover has both an elaborate finial and a raised decorated strip around the rim, so that all the altered aspects of the Royal Gold Cup are present.|$|E
