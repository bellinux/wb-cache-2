25|$|Diversification in {{products}} available in St. Louis {{took place during}} the economic recovery, {{largely as a result of}} the new steamboat power. Confectioneries, jewelers, bookstores, musical instrument shops, lumber yards, and mortuaries all opened for the first time in the late 1820s and 1830s. Banking began to reestablish itself in the late 1830s with brokerage and insurance firms also offering deposits, until a banking crisis again <b>forced</b> <b>liquidation</b> of several companies in the early 1840s. Wholesalers also began to operate during the 1830s, supplying retail establishments from large company warehouses in the city. The city's Merchants Exchange, founded in 1836, was the first commodity-trading exchange in the United States. Also, the fur trade continued as a major commercial venture through the 1820s and into the 1830s.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, Carlyle Capital Corporation, {{established}} in August 2006 {{for the purpose}} of making investments in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, defaulted on about $16.6 billion of debt as the global credit crunch brought about by the subprime mortgage crisis worsened for leveraged investors. The Guernsey-based affiliate of Carlyle was very heavily leveraged, up to 32 times by some accounts, and it expects its creditors to seize its remaining assets. Tremors in the mortgage markets induced several of Carlyle's 13 lenders to make margin calls or to declare Carlyle in default on its loans. In response to the <b>forced</b> <b>liquidation</b> of mortgage-backed assets caused by the Carlyle margin calls and other similar developments in credit markets, on March 11, 2008, the Federal Reserve gave Wall Street's primary dealers the right to post mortgaged-back securities as collateral for loans of up to $200 billion in higher-grade, U.S. government-backed securities.|$|E

The result follows from assumptions {{that the market is}} organized along auction lines with private information and is imperfect in that owners are occasionally forced to sell in order to raise cash for exogenous reasons.

One by-product is that buy-and-hold strategies are optimal in certain variants of this model. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{theoretically}} simulate default risk scenarios under various economic noises. We find that firms default more quickly with stronger economic shocks but simultaneously expose higher default probabilities during their deterioration, offering traders better visibility. When the macroeconomic environment exhibits positive autocorrelation, the volatility of assets’ value increases with corporate creditworthiness, and vice versa. While positive autocorrelation <b>forces</b> <b>liquidation</b> more swiftly even for firms with higher risk tolerance, counter-cyclical economic movements reduce default risk for firms with greater sustainability. When a series of economic noises exhibits higher autocorrelation, although average default probabilities decline, firms tend to default more rapidly, making it tougher for traders to predict corporate failure. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} strategic trading in markets with large arbitrageurs. If arbitrageurs are not well capitalized, capital constraints make their trades predictable. Other market participants can exploit this by trading against them. Competitors may find it optimal to lend to arbitrageurs that are financially fragile; additional capital makes the arbitrageurs more viable, and lenders can reap profits from trading against them for a longer time. The strategic behavior of these market participants has implications for the functioning of financial markets. Strategic trading may produce significant price distortions, increase price manipulation, and trigger <b>forced</b> <b>liquidations</b> of large traders.

50|$|Before the {{establishment}} of the Federal Reserve, the banking system had dealt with periodic crises (such as in the Panic of 1907) by suspending the convertibility of deposits into currency. In 1907, the system nearly collapsed and there was an extraordinary intervention by an ad-hoc coalition assembled by J. P. Morgan. In the years 1910-1913, the bankers demanded a central bank to address this structural weakness. Friedman suggested, however, that if a policy similar to the Panic had been followed during the banking panic at the end of 1930, it might have stopped the vicious circle of the <b>forced</b> <b>liquidation</b> of assets at depressed prices, just as suspension of convertibility in 1893 and 1907 had quickly ended the liquidity crises at the time.|$|E
40|$|In liquid markets the {{frequency}} or timing of settlement (marking-to-market) {{may not be}} expected to impact prices. However during illiquid periods with leveraged trading, settlement can {{have a significant impact on}} <b>forced</b> <b>liquidations</b> and price volatility. This paper presents an agent-based model of real time settlement in a leveraged market with zero-intelligent traders in an open-outcry double auction, stylized after a futures market. Initial simulations produce the emergent market phenomenon of volatility clustering in returns and serial correlation in prices, which is related to the degree of leverage among traders. These results suggest that mark-to-market real time settlement promotes overshooting in prices, as price changes lead to a cascade of deleveraging among market participants in an illiquid market. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} two questions: When {{should we}} expect asset measurements {{to contribute to}} macroeconomic fluctuations? Should regulators adapt the measure-ment to financial shocks? We develop a model in which firms borrow funds subject to collateral constraints and implement an ex-ante asset measurement rule. In this environment, we characterize the nature of optimal measurement rules and analyze their interaction with interest rates and financial shocks. Under certain conditions, impairment accounting contributes to the financial accelerator, magnifying the effect of financial shocks on investment. A regulatory process that ignores the dependence of the interest rate on the measurement often selects the “wrong ” measurement, with excessive reliance on impairment accounting and <b>forced</b> <b>liquidations...</b>|$|R
