5|$|In Greek mythology, Taurus was {{identified}} with Zeus, who assumed {{the form of}} a magnificent white bull to abduct Europa, a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations of Greek mythology, only the front portion of this constellation are depicted; this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. A second Greek myth portrays Taurus as Io, a mistress of Zeus. To hide his lover from his wife Hera, Zeus changed Io into {{the form of a}} <b>heifer.</b> Greek mythographer Acusilaus marks the bull Taurus as the same that formed the myth of the Cretan Bull, one of The Twelve Labors of Heracles.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar is a stalk-and-ambush {{rather than}} a chase predator. The cat will walk slowly down forest paths, {{listening}} for and stalking prey before rushing or ambushing. The jaguar attacks from cover and usually from a target's blind spot with a quick pounce; the species' ambushing abilities are considered nearly peerless in the animal kingdom by both indigenous people and field researchers, and are probably a product of its role as an apex predator in several different environments. The ambush may include leaping into water after prey, as a jaguar is quite capable of carrying a large kill while swimming; its strength is such that carcasses {{as large as a}} <b>heifer</b> can be hauled up a tree to avoid flood levels.|$|E

5|$|Before one combat a {{beautiful}} young woman comes to him, claiming to be the daughter of a king, and offers him her love, but he refuses her. The woman reveals herself as the Morrígan, and in revenge for this slight, she attacks him in various animal forms while he is engaged in combat against Lóch mac Mofemis. As an eel, she trips him in the ford, but he breaks her ribs. As a wolf, she stampedes cattle across the ford, but he blinds her eye with a sling-stone. Finally, she appears as a <b>heifer</b> {{at the head of the}} stampede, but he breaks her leg with another sling stone.

5|$|Though he {{was gaining}} adherents, Aberhart insisted that his aim {{was not to}} enter politics, but to persuade {{existing}} parties to adopt social credit in their platforms. To this end, he appeared at the UFA convention of 15 January 1935. The night before, he organised a reception for delegates. Besides Aberhart, it featured actors portraying two characters of whom Aberhart had been making considerable use in presentations around the province: the Man from Mars, who expressed bewilderment that poverty could exist {{in the midst of}} plenty and that governments were doing nothing about it, and Kant B. Dunn, who brought up straw man arguments against social credit for Aberhart to dismantle. Another of Aberhart's characters, the bumbling socialist C.

40|$|Metabolic {{adaptation}} during feed deprivation {{was determined}} in five Kamphaengsaen (KPS) and six crossbred Brahman (Crossbred Bra) <b>heifers.</b> All <b>heifers</b> were fed {{at the rate}} of 85 % of the metabolizable energy requirement for maintenance. At the end of 20 days of restricted feeding, the Crossbred Bra <b>heifers</b> lost more bodyweight than the KPS <b>heifers</b> (12. 0 vs. 7. 2 kg) (P < 0. 05). In both groups of <b>heifers</b> there was a similar depletion of back-fat thickness, however, the loin eye area of the Crossbred Bra <b>heifers</b> decreased more than KPS <b>heifers</b> (8. 43 vs. 0. 92 %; P < 0. 05). Feed restriction elevated the rate of lipolysis in adipose tissue, resulting in increased nonesterified fatty acids concentrations in plasma. The Crossbred Bra <b>heifers</b> had a greater serum high density lipoprotein triacylglycerol concentration than the KPS <b>heifers</b> (17. 02 vs. 9. 53 mg/dL; P < 0. 05).

40|$|A JASSA {{study to}} compare the {{reproductive}} performance of yearling <b>heifers</b> with that of two year old <b>heifers</b> and to determine whether hormone addition could improve fertility in yearling beef <b>heifers.</b> The objective {{of this study was}} {{to compare the}} reproductive performance of yearling <b>heifers</b> with that of two year old <b>heifers</b> and to determine whether oestrus synchronisation with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) and prostaglandin F 2 a(PGF 2 a) could improve fertility in yearling beef <b>heifers.</b> The experiment was conducted at Grasslands Research Station, Marondera, Zimbabwe from October 1997 to July 1998. Supplementary feeding of 52 Tuli yearling <b>heifers,</b> seven to nine months old, was initiated at the beginning of the experiment. This was done to ensure that the <b>heifers</b> would have attained a target breeding weight of 260 to 300 kg (60 to 65 percent of the mature cow body weight) by 13 to 15 months of age. The yearling <b>heifers</b> and 20 two year old <b>heifers</b> were observed for signs of oestrus starting two months prior to the onset of breeding. At 13 to 15 months of age the yearling <b>heifers</b> weighed on average 265 ± 15 kg. The <b>heifers</b> were randomly divided into two equal groups, and one group was synchronised for oestrus with GnRH (2 ml Receptal® per injection) and PGF 2 a (1 ml Prosolvin® per injection) given six days later. All <b>heifers</b> then ran with three Tuli bulls over a 60 day breeding period. Blood samples were taken for plasma progesterone concentration determination. The pre-breeding mean interval between oestruses for yearling <b>heifers</b> was longer (21. 9 ± 1. 6 d vs 17. 7 ± 1. 0 d; P 0. 05) between synchronised and non-synchronised <b>heifers.</b> The results indicated that yearling Tuli <b>heifers</b> showed normal oestrous activity but had lower conception rates than the two year old <b>heifers.</b> In addition, the results showed that reproductive performance of the yearling <b>heifers</b> was not improved by synchronising oestrus with GnRH and PGF 2 a and that there was little benefit in breeding Tuli <b>heifers</b> below 280 kg body weight...|$|R

25|$|This poem, {{traditionally}} placed at Amores 3.5, is considered spurious. The poet describes {{a dream to}} an interpreter, saying that he sees while escaping from the heat of noon a white <b>heifer</b> near a bull; when the <b>heifer</b> is pecked by a crow, it leaves the bull for a meadow with other bulls. The interpreter interprets the dream as a love allegory; the bull represents the poet, the <b>heifer</b> a girl, and the crow an old woman. The old woman spurs the girl to leave her lover and find someone else. The poem {{is known to have}} circulated independently and its lack of engagement with Tibullan or Propertian elegy argue in favor of its spuriousness; however, the poem does seem to be datable to the early empire.|$|E

25|$|Anyone {{who came}} into contact with a human corpse, or grave, was so ritually impure that they had to be {{sprinkled}} with the water produced from the red <b>heifer</b> ritual, in order to become ritually pure again; however, the person who carried out the red <b>heifer</b> ritual and who sprinkled the water, was to be treated as having become ritually impure by doing so. According to biblical scholars, this ritual derives from the same origin as the ritual described in Deuteronomy for a group of people to atone for murder by an unknown perpetrator, according to which a <b>heifer</b> is killed at a stream, and hands are washed over it; biblical scholars believe that these are both ultimately cases of sympathetic magic, and similar rituals existed in Greek and Roman mythology. The masoretic text describes the water produced from the red <b>heifer</b> ritual as a sin offering; some English translations discount this detail, because it differs from other sin offerings by not being killed at the altar, although biblical scholars believe that this demonstrates a failure by these translations to understand the meaning of sin offerings.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{establish}} the capacity of buffalo <b>heifers</b> to adapt their metabolic requirements to a low energy diet. Murrah buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) <b>heifers</b> undergoing regular estrous cycles were randomly assigned by age, live weight (LW) and body condition score (BCS) to a high energy group (HE, 5. 8 milk forage units (MFU) /day, n = 6) or low energy group (LE, 3. 6 MFU/day, n = 6). Circulating concentrations of metabolic substrates, metabolic hormones and reproductive hormones were determined weekly for 19 weeks. Ovarian follicular characteristics and oocyte parameters were also ascertained weekly. <b>Heifers</b> fed the LE diet had a better dry matter conversion than <b>heifers</b> fed the HE diet and the calculated daily energy provision was negative for <b>heifers</b> fed the LE diet (− 0. 248 MFU) and positive for <b>heifers</b> fed the HE diet (5. 4 MFU). <b>Heifers</b> fed the HE diet had an increase in 50 kg LW over {{the duration of the}} study whereas LW remained constant for <b>heifers</b> fed the LE diet. The BCS of <b>heifers</b> fed the HE diet (4. 2) was greater (P < 0. 05) than the BCS for <b>heifers</b> fed the LE diet (3. 4). <b>Heifers</b> fed the HE diet had greater (P < 0. 05) circulating concentrations of metabolic substrates (glucose, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol) and metabolic hormones (insulin, glucagon, leptin and T 3) compared with <b>heifers</b> fed the LE diet. There {{were no significant differences in}} circulating reproductive hormones between the two groups of <b>heifers.</b> Ovarian follicular characteristics were similar for the two groups of <b>heifers</b> while <b>heifers</b> fed the LE diet tended to have oocytes of reduced quality compared with <b>heifers</b> fed the HE diet. The most notable finding was that <b>heifers</b> fed the LE diet had a negative calculated daily energy provision but were able to maintainLWand reproductive activity. It was concluded that buffalo <b>heifers</b> may potentially have the capacity to undergo metabolic adjustment and reduce their energy requirements when dietary energy is limiting. This adaptive capacity would explain why buffaloes remain productive in environments that are limiting to other ruminants...|$|R
