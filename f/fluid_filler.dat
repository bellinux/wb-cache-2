40|$|ABSTRACT: Traumatic brain {{injuries}} (TBI) caused by shock waves have attracted increased attention {{due to the}} large percentage of combat troops that have sustained such injuries in recent wars. Use of advanced body armor has decreased the number of fatalities due to ballistic impacts after explosions, increasing the percentage of observed non-fatal {{brain injuries}} from blast waves. A new design concept for a combat helmet liner is proposed that introduces solid and <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> materials inside channels in the foam liner to improve the attenuation of incoming shock waves. Mechanisms include acoustic impedance mismatches at the filler/foam material interface, viscous energy dissipation via <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> motion, and multiple reflection interfaces in granular filler materials. Both shock tube experiments and numerical studies using ABAQUS ® are carried out. Intricacies of the numerical model developed in ABAQUS ® to model the shock response of structures are discussed. Preliminary results show that use of high density filler materials results in higher levels of blast attenuation than those observed with low density materials, when compared to solid foam control samples. The peak transmitted overpressure and pressure gradient are substantially reduced, while {{the duration of the}} positive pressure pulse is increased...|$|E
40|$|Nature {{is replete}} with {{examples}} of embedded microvascular systems that enable efficient fluid flow and distribution for autonomic healing, cooling, and energy harvesting. The ability to incorporate microvascular networks in functional materials systems is therefore both scientifically and technologically important. In this PhD thesis, the direct-write assembly of planar and 3 D biomimetic microvascular networks within polymer and hydrogel matrices is demonstrated. In addition, the influence of network design of fluid transport efficiency is characterized. 	Planar microvascular networks composed of periodic lattices of uniformal microchannels and hierarchical, branching architectures are constructed by direct-write assembly of a fugitive organic ink. Several advancements are required to facilitate their patterning, including pressure valving, dual ink printing, and dynamic pressure variation to allow tunable control of ink deposition. The hydraulic conductance is measured using a high pressure flow meter {{as a function of}} network design. For a constant vascular volume and areal coverage, 2 - and 4 -generation branched architectures that obey Murray's Law exhibited the highest hydraulic conductivity. These experimental observations are in good agreement with predictions made by analytic models. 	 3 D microvascular networks are fabricated by omnidirectional printing a fugitive organic ink into a photopolymerizable hydrogel matrix that is capped with <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> of nearly identical composition. Using this approach, 3 D networks of arbitrary design can be patterned. After ink deposition is complete, the matrix and <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> are chemically cross-linked via UV irradiation, and the ink is removed by liquefication. Aqueous solutions composed of a triblock copolymer of polyethylene oxide (PEO) -polypropylene oxide (PPO) -PEO constitute the materials system of choice due to their thermal- and concentration-dependent phase behavior. Specifically, the fugitive ink consists of a 23 w/w% PEO-PPO-PEO (Pluronic F 127) solution, while matrix (25 w/w%) and <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> (20 w/w%) are composed of an acrylate-modified form of the Pluronic F 127 that can be subsequently photopolymerized. The ink and matrix concentrations exceed the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 22 w/w% and thus reside in a physical gel state. At their respective concentrations, they possess an elastic plateau modulus G' > 104 Pa needed for ink filament formation, shape retention, and support during the printing process. By contrast, the <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> is formulated below the CMC to facilitate its flow into void spaces created as the nozzle translates through the matrix during printing. After printing is completed, photopolymerization is carried out to yield a chemically cross-linked matrix from which the fugitive ink is removed leaving behind the desired 3 D microvascular network. 	 Due to the potential application of 3 D microvasularized hydrogels in tissue engineering, dye diffusion through the cured Pluronic F 127 -diacrylate matrix is investigated via fluorescent microscopy. Image analysis is used to extract diffusion profiles of the dye as a function of time. Extraction of the 1 -D Gaussian fitting parameters is used to determine the spatial peak variance  2 and plotted as a function of time to determine the dye diffusivity...|$|E

Its application and efficiency is shown with two practical engineering application examples. The first example describes the modeling of fuel sloshing in a reservoir, where different formulations, using mesh-based and meshless methods, are compared and evaluated according to experimental measurements.

40|$|L-carnitine {{plays a role}} in {{physiological}} reactions {{throughout the}} body, including sugar aerobic metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation and, most importantly, fatty acid oxidation. In addition, L-carnitine has antiapoptotic, antioxidative and osmolytic properties, which may be useful in the treatment of ocular pathologies (e. g. retinitis pigmentosa [RP] and keratoconus), in corneal tissue repair and in ophthalmic procedures (e. g. photorefractive keratectomy and laser-assisted subepithelial keratectomy [LASEK]). Preliminary studies have suggested that L-carnitine supplementation may be useful in patients with RP. Although studies are warranted to ascertain the benefit of L-carnitine in the LASEK procedure, potentially it could be used instead of alcohol to facilitate epithelial detachment and as a hypo-osmotic solution in the <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> used in therapeutic photoablation. Furthermore, its antiapoptotic properties may improve cellular migration, proliferation and adhesion of keratocytes, epithelial cells and endothelial cells, which may be useful in the corneal repair process.

40|$|A large {{percentage}} of combat troops suffered Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) due to Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) in recent wars in the Middle East. The majority of TBIs were caused by exposure to blast waves. Use of advanced body armor has decreased the number of fatalities due to impacts after the explosions, {{increasing the number of}} observed non-fatal brain injuries from the blast waves. A large number of TBIs due to impact hits are also reported in skiers, bicyclists, football players etc. A new design concept for the helmet liners is being proposed that introduces solid or <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> material in channels inside the helmet liner. The main emphasis has been to improve the attenuation of incoming shock waves in the Army helmets; however, some impacts studies were also carried out for sports helmets. Directed blast experiments in collaboration with Purdue University and numerical studies using the ConWep module available in ABAQUS v 6. 10 are carried out. Fluid fillers are modeled using the coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) functionality of ABAQUS. Preliminary results using flat plate sandwich structures with rectangular channels show that the use of high density filler material results in higher levels of blast mitigation. The peak transmitted overpressure is substantially reduced, while the duration of the positive pressure pulse and the rise time are increased leading to reduced pressure gradients. <b>Fluid</b> <b>filler</b> materials were also found to be promising. Viscosity was not found to be a potential mechanism for blast mitigation as hypothesized. No significant advantage of using circular or criss-cross channel geometries was observed. Prototypes of the first design of the helmet liner with channels have been fabricated, and their testing is under way. Development of a numerical model to observe the response to blast of the modified liner coupled with the Army's Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) and a human head is also currently in progress. Experimental impact studies were carried out comparing POC ski helmets with standard ski helmets. Over multiple impacts, POC ski helmets showed substantially lower peak accelerations. Different filler materials in the sandwich structures were drop tested. Both the numerical model and the experiments showed higher impact attenuation by the use of viscous fluid in the sandwich structures subjected to drop tests. by Rahul Goel. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{experimental and}} computational testing of regular open-cell cellular structures behaviour under impact loading. Open-cell cellular specimens made of aluminium alloy and polymer were experimentally tested under quasi-static and dynamic compressive loading {{in order to}} evaluate the failure conditions and the strain rate sensitivity. Additionally, specimens with viscous fillers have been tested to determine the increase of the energy absorption due to filler effects. The tests have shown that brittle behaviour of the cellular structure due to sudden rupture of intercellular walls observed in quasi-static and dynamic tests is reduced by introduction of viscous filler, {{while at the same}} time the energy absorption is increased. The influence of <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> on open-cell cellular material behaviour under impact loading was further investigated with parametric computational simulations, where fully coupled interaction between the base material and the pore filler was considered. The explicit nonlinear finite element code ls-dyna was used for this purpose. Different failure criteria were evaluated to simulate the collapsing of intercellular walls and the failure mechanism of cellular structures in general. The new computational models and presented procedures enable determination of the optimal geometric and material parameters of cellular materials with viscous fillers for individual application demands. For example, the cellular structure stiffness and impact energy absorption through controlled deformation can be easily adapted to improve the efficiency of crash absorber...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{wind and}} solar energy sources is {{increasing}} rapidly and because of their varying power production values, balancing supply and demand of the electricity consumption has become an area of research. For this several different energy storages have been invented. Their use {{is not limited to}} electricity generation and they have varying advantages and disadvantages. The {{purpose of this study is}} to research thermal energy storages and compare them to different energy storages by cost, efficiency and power generation. The heat transfer <b>fluids</b> and <b>filler</b> materials used in thermal storages are discussed. Insulations are examined, while focusing on materials suitable for high temperatures. Heat losses and insulation properties of small scale thermal energy storage that uses solar salt as a phase change storage material was studied. The different insulation methods used for the experiment, where vacuum and expanded perlite in a vacuum. Due to the radiative heat losses T 4 correlation with the temperature, the focus during the experiments was the radiative losses. One experiment was conducted with the annular gaps pressure lowered to 0. 02 mbar and in the second experiment the annular gap was filled with expanded perlite and the pressure lowered to 0. 02 mbar. During both experiments the solar salt was heated to around 320 °C and then cooled down to room temperature at a natural rate. The insulation capabilities were observed. The heat flux at 306. 3 °C at the first experiment was 306. 42 W/m 2, which was the main source of heat loss. At 80 °C the heat flux in the first experiment was 14. 76 W/m 2. The second experiment with expanded perlite in the annular gap at 318 °C had the radiative thermal conductivity of 0. 01010 W/(mK). At 80 °C the radiative thermal conductivity in the second experiment was 0. 00344 W/(mK). It was observed that at lower temperatures, when the radiative heat loss is not dominant, the heat loss was reduced. In a thermal energy storage the choice of heat transfer <b>fluid</b> and the <b>filler</b> material is important for efficiency and cost.

40|$|Operation {{during the}} charge and {{discharge}} cycles of molten-salt thermoclines used for {{solar thermal energy}} storage depends strongly on the environmental boundary conditions to which the tanks are exposed. A comprehensive model which accounts for thermal transport in the molten-salt heat transfer <b>fluid</b> and the <b>filler</b> material in the tank is developed for exploring the effects of boundary conditions on thermocline performance. Heat loss from the tank under non-adiabatic boundary conditions is found to distort the temperature and salt flow distributions relative to the uniform conditions found in adiabatic thermoclines; as a result, the outflow temperature drops more rapidly in the former case. Such effects of non-adiabatic boundaries become insignificant at large salt-flow Reynolds numbers. As the Reynolds number increases beyond 250, the discharge efficiency of non-adiabatic thermoclines approaches that of the adiabatic counterparts. In the case of significant heat loss at the walls, the discharge efficiency of thermoclines increases with increasing Reynolds number, a trend that is opposite to that in adiabatic thermoclines.

40|$|A novel {{acoustic}} sensor incorporating cilia-like nanowires made of magnetostrictive iron-gallium (Galfenol) alloy {{has been designed}} and fabricated using micromachining techniques. The sensor and its package design are analogous to the structural design and the transduction process of a human-ear cochlea. The nanowires are sandwiched between a flexible membrane and a fixed membrane similar to the cilia between basilar and tectorial membranes in the cochlea. The stress induced in the nanowires due to {{the motion of the}} flexible membrane in response to acoustic waves results in a change in the magnetic flux in the nanowires. These changes in the magnetic flux are converted into electrical voltage changes by a GMR (giant magnetoresistive) sensor. As the {{acoustic sensor}} is designed for underwater applications, packaging is a key issue for the effective working of this sensor.

40|$|Traumatic brain {{injuries}} caused by shock waves have attracted increased medical and scientific attention {{due to the}} large percentage of combat troops that have sustained such injuries in recent conflict theatres. To this day, the knowledge {{in the fields of}} causes, effects and identification of traumatic brain injury is limited. The use of advanced body armor has decreased the number of fatalities from fragments observed in previous military operations, resulting in the increase of non-fatal {{brain injuries}} from shock waves. The purpose of this project is the advancement of the knowledge in the field of shock wave mitigation strategies {{and the development of a}} helmet liner for protection against blast induced trauma. The proposed helmet liner design is based on the introduction of solid and <b>fluid</b> <b>filler</b> materials inside channels opened in the interior of a foam liner in order to enhance the attenuation of incoming shock waves. Primary investigated attenuation mechanisms include acoustic impedance mismatches between the filler and foam material interfaces, viscous effects of fluid fillers, porosity and particle size of solid filler materials. Specific goals of this research project include the reduction of the peak pressure and pressure gradient of the transmitted wave through the helmet liner and the enhancement of the spatial distribution of the energy of the incoming shock wave. (cont.) This research effort employed both shock tube experiments and numerical studies in order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed helmet liner design. Quantitative results have shown that the use of high density filler materials result in higher attenuation levels than low density materials while comparing to solid foam control samples. The peak transmitted overpressure and pressure gradient were significantly reduced with the use of high density materials while the duration of the positive phase was increased. This response resulted in lower overall impulse values of the transmitted wave. The use of high density filler materials also results in superior frequency distribution. by George Alexander Christou.

40|$|Conventional heat-transfer fluids such as water, {{ethylene}} glycol, standard {{oils and}} other lubricants are typically low-efficiency heat-transfer fluids. Thermal management plays {{a critical factor}} in many applications where these fluids can be used, such as in motors/engines, solar cells, biopharmaceuticals, fuel cells, high voltage power transmission systems, micro/nanoelectronics mechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), and nuclear cooling among others. These insulating <b>fluids</b> require superb <b>filler</b> dispersion, high thermal conduction, and for certain applications as in electrical/electronic devices also electrical insulation. The miniaturization and high efficiency of electrical/electronic devices in these fields demand successful heat management and energy-efficient fluid-based heat-transfer systems. Recent advances in layered materials enable large scale synthesis of various two-dimensional (2 D) structures. Some of these 2 D materials are good choices as nanofillers in heat transfer fluids; mainly due to their inherent high thermal conductivity (TC) and high surface area available for thermal energy transport. Among various 2 D-nanostructures, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and graphene (G) exhibit versatile properties such as outstanding TC, excellent mechanical stability, and remarkable chemical inertness. The following research, even though investigate various conventional fluids, will focus on dielectric insulating nanofluids (mineral oil - MO) with significant thermal performance. It is presented the plan for synthesis and characterization of stable high-thermal conductivity nanofluids using 2 D-nanostructures of h-BN, which will be further incorporated at diverse filler concentrations to conventional fluids for cooling applications, without compromising its electrical insulating property. For comparison, properties of h-BN based fluids are compared with conductive fillers such as graphene; where graphene has similar crystal structure of h-BN and also has similar bulk thermal conductivity.

40|$|The {{demand for}} clean and {{environmentally}} benign energy resources {{has been a}} great concern in the last two decades. To alleviate the associated environmental problems, reduction of the use of fossil fuels by developing more cost-effective renewable energy technologies becomes more and more significant. Among various types of renewable energy sources, solar energy and bioenergy take a great proportion. This dissertation focuses on the heat transfer and flow in solar energy and bioenergy systems, specifically for Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems in Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants and open-channel algal culture raceways for biofuel production. The first part of this dissertation is the discussion about mathematical modeling, numerical simulation and experimental investigation of solar TES system. First of all, in order to accurately and efficiently simulate the conjugate heat transfer between Heat Transfer <b>Fluid</b> (HTF) and <b>filler</b> material in four different solid-fluid TES configurations, formulas of an eﬀective heat transfer coeﬃcient were theoretically developed and presented by extending the validity of Lumped Capacitance Method (LCM) to large Biot number, as well as verifications/validations to this simplified model. Secondly, to provide design guidelines for TES system in CSP plant using Phase Change Materials (PCM), a general storage tank volume sizing strategy and an energy storage startup strategy were proposed using the enthalpy-based 1 D transient model. Then experimental investigations were conducted to explore a novel thermal storage material. The thermal storage performances were also compared between this novel storage material and concrete at a temperature range from 400 °C to 500 °C. It is recommended to apply this novel thermal storage material to replace concrete at high operating temperatures in sensible heat TES systems. The second part of this dissertation mainly focuses on the numerical and experimental study of an open-channel algae culture raceway for biofuel production. According to the proposed flow field design of ARID-HV algal raceway, experiments and numerical simulation have been conducted to understand the enhancement of flow mixing in the flow field of ARID-HV raceway by cutting slots on top of the dam near the dead zones. A new method was proposed to quantitatively evaluate the flow mixing by using the statistics of temporal and spatial distribution of the massless fluid particles (centered in each cell at the inlet surface) in the raceway collecting the data of path-lines of fluid particles from CFD results. It is hoped that this method can be applied to assist the algal raceway flow field design as well as other engineering applications. The third part introduces the details about the construction work of a high temperature molten salt test loop. Because of the limited operating temperature of conventional synthetic oils, in order to obtain higher energy conversion efficiency, higher operating temperature is always desirable in a CSP plant which leads to the requirement of new generation of HTF. Currently, a halide salt eutectic mixture (NaCl-KCl-ZnCl₂) as a potential HTF for future CSP applications has been proposed by a multi-institute research team, led by University of Arizona. The thermophysical properties of the halide eutectic salt have been measured. However, this new developed halide eutectic salt has not been tested in a circulating loop at a high operating temperature for the measurement of heat transfer coefficient. It is a significant effort to build such a test system due to extremely high operating temperature. As a consequence, in the third part of this dissertation, details about the design of the lab-scale test system and all the equipment items will be introduced. The investigations included in this dissertation for the heat transfer and flow in solar energy and bioenergy systems are of particular interest to the renewable energy engineering community. It is expected that the proposed methods can provide useful information for engineers and researchers...|$|R
