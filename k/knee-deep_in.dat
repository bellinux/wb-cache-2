25|$|Throughout Baja California Sur, {{officials}} {{estimated that}} damages from the hurricane was equivalent to 292.2 million MXN (25 million USD). Water damages totaled to 8.8million MXN ($650,000 USD). Furthermore, damage to homes was 68.3 million pesos (6 million USD) while damage to school {{was reported to}} be 5 million MXN ($41,000 USD). In addition, highway damage totaled to 36.6 million MXN (USD). Roughly 5,000 homes sustained severe damage and roads throughout the state were also severely affected. About 100,000 people were without power {{at the height of the}} storm. The worst damage occurred in the municipality of Comondú where 16,000 residents reported damage to their homes. A total of 2,850 people were housed in temporary shelters. According to tourism officials, hotel reservations were down 40% in Los Cabos and Lorento Roofs were ripped off buildings and many trees were damaged. On the islands of Santa Margarita and Magdalena, 40% of homes received some damage, mostly roof damage. The La Paz airport closed prior to the arrival of the system, but the Los Cabos International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the tropical cyclone. In La Paz, the storm produced violent winds, a few last-minute drivers on streets with fallen trees. Rescue workers had to rescue many Mexicans in low-lying areas from their wood and sheet metal homes. In a drive-thru entrance, a happy hour sign was ripped off due to strong winds. Local residents south shelter by school buses and army trucks as floodwaters entered their homes. High winds uprooted palm trees and the water was <b>knee-deep</b> <b>in</b> many areas of Puerto San Carlos.|$|E
500|$|The name {{tantalum}} {{was derived}} from the name of the mythological Tantalus, the father of Niobe in Greek mythology. In the story, he had been punished after death by being condemned to stand <b>knee-deep</b> <b>in</b> water with perfect fruit growing above his head, both of which eternally tantalized him. (If he bent to drink the water, it drained below the level he could reach, and if he reached for the fruit, the branches moved out of his grasp.) Ekeberg wrote [...] "This metal I call tantalum ... partly in allusion to its incapacity, when immersed in acid, to absorb any and be saturated." ...|$|E

50|$|Previously {{saturated}} by Typhoon Pabuk, {{the outer}} bands of Wutip produced torrential rains over Luzon, Philippines, triggering numerous landslides and flash flooding. Two {{people were killed}} in a landslide in northern Luzon while another was electrocuted <b>in</b> <b>knee-deep</b> flooding <b>in</b> Manila. Widespread street flooding resulted in large traffic jams and numerous road closures. Ten homes were destroyed and another 32 were damaged by Wutip. A total of six people were killed by the storm, three due to electrocution, and seven were injured due to a tornado. A total of 239,292 people were affected by the storm and damages amounted to PHP16.8 million (US$349,000).|$|R

500|$|The {{conditions}} for the Americans constructing the siege works were difficult. The ground was swampy, and the trenches quickly became filled <b>knee-deep</b> <b>in</b> water. Montgomery described his army as [...] "half-drowned rats crawling through a swamp". To make matters even worse, food and ammunition supplies were running out, and the British {{showed no sign of}} giving in despite the American bombardment. Disease also worked to reduce the effectiveness of the Americans; by mid-October, more than 900 men had been sent back to Ticonderoga due to illness. In {{the early days of the}} siege, the fort's defenders took advantage of the land they had cleared around the fort to make life as difficult as possible for the besiegers erecting batteries. Major Preston wrote in his journal on September 23 that [...] "a deserter [...] the enemy are erecting their battery and we distress them as much as we can with shells." [...] Until large guns arrived from Ticonderoga, the fort's defenders enjoyed a significant advantage in firepower.|$|E
500|$|... 1RAR {{spent most}} of May 1945 {{building}} quarters and training before marching the [...] to Prome in late June; from here they went another [...] by truck to Gyobingauk. The monsoon conditions took a dreadful toll on operations, making logistics particularly difficult and slow—men found themselves either found themselves <b>knee-deep</b> <b>in</b> mud or slipping around on the surface. From early July 1945 1RAR patrolled around Gyobingauk, repeatedly engaging parties of Japanese and forcing them into the hills. Even after the Japanese commanders in Burma surrendered unconditionally, the Allied troops had to continue patrolling to handle Japanese stragglers who either did know of this or did not believe it. After the Japanese forces in South-East Asia formally surrendered at Singapore on 12 September 1945, active Allied operations in the region were greatly diminished. 1RAR spent about half a year guarding Japanese prisoners in Burma before leaving for home in March 1946. They arrived back in Salisbury on 10 May.|$|E

50|$|Hurricane Norbert struck Mexico's Baja California {{peninsula}} with torrential {{rains and}} winds {{of up to}} 155 km/h. Strong winds bent palm trees along coastal areas. Some streets were <b>in</b> <b>knee-deep</b> water <b>in</b> the town of Puerto San Carlos. Norbert ripped off roofs, knocking down trees and left one person missing and more than 20,000 homes without electricity, local authorities say. Some 2850 people were housed in temporary shelters. Forty percent of homes were totally or partially damaged on the islands of Margarita and Magdalena, mainly having lost their roofs, said a report from state protection services. La Paz international airport suspended its activities at midday local time Saturday, but the tourist resort of Los Cabos remained open. Hotel reservations were down by around 40 per cent mainly in Los Cabos and Loreto, local tourism officials said.|$|R

Through the deep heather, down the gullies, over the watercourses, up the broken slopes, Pommers flew, his great heart bursting with rage, and every fiber quivering at the indignities which he had endured.|$|R
2500|$|Grillo's {{book draws}} a {{portrait}} of the Mexican drug cartels and how they have radically transformed {{in the past couple of}} decades. For the author, the criminal organizations in Mexico are not gangs; they are a [...] "movement and an industry drawing in hundreds of thousands from bullet-ridden barrios to marijuana-growing mountains". The book explains how the cartels have created paramilitary death squads with tens of thousands of armed men from the country of Guatemala to the Texan border. It contains testimonies from members inside of the cartels; and while El Narco shows that the [...] "devastation" [...] of the Mexican Drug War may be south of the U.S. border, Grillo pinpoints that the United States [...] "is <b>knee-deep</b> <b>in</b> this conflict".|$|E
2500|$|For its seventh game, Vanderbilt {{faced the}} {{defending}} Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) champion Georgia Bulldogs at home. The game, {{the highlight of}} Vanderbilt's season, was described by The New York Times as an [...] "important clash" [...] and would determine the SIAA champion. Georgia scored during the first half; {{early in the fourth}} quarter Neely intercepted a pass, weaving for 25 yards to Georgia's 40-yard line before he was tackled by Jim Reynolds. Two long pass attempts failed, and Thomas Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith sneaked behind Ryan; he rushed to recover the 25-yard onside kick, jumping up to get the ball off a bounce from the Bulldogs and racing for a 15-yard touchdown. The game ended in a tie, and the teams shared the SIAA championship. Vanderbilt finished its season against Sewanee in [...] "the muddiest game in its history"; the Commodores were reportedly <b>knee-deep</b> <b>in</b> mud and water, with the players unrecognizable. The game was scoreless until the fourth quarter, when Sewanee fumbled the snap on a punt; the punter was smothered by the Commodores' Neely, Godchaux and Wade for a safety. Hek Wakefield later scored a touchdown for a 9–0 Vanderbilt win.|$|E
2500|$|Reforma, a Mexican newspaper, {{said that}} Grillo used the [...] "closest {{information}} possible to his object of work", {{which means that}} he ran through serious [...] "threats" [...] to get his work done. Due to Grillo's experience and professionalism, Reforma argues that El Narco is both [...] "horrifying and useful". The San Antonio Express-News claims that the book [...] "delivers the first authoritative and comprehensive examination" [...] of the mafia killings in Mexico. The newspaper explains that Grillo's book can help readers [...] "understand the homicidal madness just across the river". It concluded by comparing the book with a [...] "big canvas" [...] that traces {{the rise of the}} Mexican drug trafficking organizations from the quaint 19th-century origins. The New Yorker wrote a review for El Narco and noted that the reading was [...] "terrific—full of vivid front-line reporting; diverse interviews; a sense of history; a touch of social science; clarifying statistics; and realistic reviews of what might be done to improve things, none of it easy". The magazine said it is an [...] "essential reading". It argued that it is America's [...] "weak control of automatic weapons" [...] and its [...] "supply [...] guns and money" [...] that fuel the bloodshed in Mexico. The Globe Corner Bookstore said that El Narco [...] "draws the first definitive portrait of Mexico's drug cartels and how they have radically transformed in the last decade". In addition, it mentioned that [...] "the devastation may be south of the Rio Grande, but America is <b>knee-deep</b> <b>in</b> this conflict." [...] The Independent noted that Grillo and his book have [...] "achieved extraordinary access to gangsters and police (often the same people)". And, the author shows how the Mexican drug cartels originated in the western state of Sinaloa, where the conditions for growing opium poppy were ideal, in the late 19th century. The New York-based magazine known as the Bookforum said that several books have been written in Spanish about Mexico's drug war, but Grillos book is perhaps the [...] "first attempt in English for a popular audience". The magazine noted that Grillo has spent years traveling to Mexico's drug war hotspots: [...] "Sinaloa, Michoacán, Ciudad Juárez—recording interviews with cops and narcos, visiting grave sites and murder scenes". Bookforum concludes that Grillo's book was an attempt to dig more and beyond the [...] "reigning mythology of the Mexican drug war".|$|E

50|$|Throughout Southeast Asia, the Neolithic Period can be {{considered}} {{the period in which}} organized societies developed. During this period the Vietnamese people spread across a large area from the foothills of the Annamite Range to the eastern coast of Northern Vietnam. It is thought that they lived in small communities with groups of extended families living in a simple communal way. The growing of rice, their staple food, had developed into two distinct methods, shifting cultivation, done on a dry field, usually in upland areas, and wet rice cultivation, which involved the construction of dikes around rivers that collected water into <b>knee-deep</b> ponds <b>in</b> which the rice was grown.|$|R

To avoid repeating the resupply difficulties encountered by the 28th Infantry Division in their battle further north near the Our and Sauer Rivers, Schmidt ordered his men to carry enough rations, ammunition, and antitank mines to last for at least 24 hours without resupply. Troops were carrying up to 120 pounds of gear.|$|R
