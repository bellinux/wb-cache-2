This study has been carried out to evaluate awareness of operating room staff about <b>fire</b> <b>sources</b> and its prevention methods in operating room. Methods and Materials: In this cross-sectional study a number of 48 persons of operating room staff from Shahroud Imam Hossein and Fatemiyeh hospitals were chosen and their awareness about <b>fire</b> <b>sources</b> (ignition Sources, oxygen sources and fuel sources) and ways of fire prevention in operating room were assessed using designed questionnaire related to prevention and fire safety in the operating room.

Results: Based on the results, 97. 9 % of participants declare that educational program related to prevention and fire safety in operating room is necessary and all of them told these programs are useful and important. 85. 4 % of participants declare that never passed any educational course related to prevention and fire safety in operating room.

40|$|Numerical Simulation by CFD {{was carried}} out to {{understand}} the hot current behavior in a tunnel with longitudinal ventilation. It becomes clear that <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> modeling is very important because the hot current behavior is strongly affected by the <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> position and is sensitive to methods in the modeling of the <b>fire</b> <b>source.</b> The flame area which has developed from the <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> {{is an area of}} chemical reaction caused by combustion. Even if grids {{in the vicinity of the}} <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> are made fine, it was difficult to simulate the heat generation area with consideration to this chemical reaction through using a method for setting the heat release rate simply on the <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> surface.

40|$|Due to {{the ceiling}} jet phenomenon, smoke above a <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> has a natural {{tendency}} to spread under the ceiling in all directions, until a barrier is reached. The present study focuses on smoke control, rather than smoke clearance, in large closed car parks. A particular situation is that the ceiling height is {{much lower than the}} horizontal car park dimensions. Also, flame heights can be in the same order of magnitude as the ceiling height, so that flames can penetrate into the smoke layer under the ceiling near the <b>fire</b> <b>source.</b> Smoke control in case of fire in large car parks can be established by horizontal mechanical ventilation. A ‘critical ventilation velocity ’ exists, for which no smoke backlayering occurs, i. e. the car park is maintained smoke-free at one side of the <b>fire</b> <b>source.</b> In many cases, however, backlayering can be allowed to a certain distance. We analyse the results from a large series of CFD-simulations, used as numerical experiments, and illustrate that there is a relation between the horizontal ventilation velocity and the backlayering distance. The backlayering distance varies linearly with the difference between the critical ventilation velocity and the actual ventilation velocity of the incoming fresh air. We perform a parameter study with variation of heat release rate per unit area, <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> area, car park width and car park height.

One possible explanation might be the community misconception that associates the decrease in fire hazards with their increasingly modern lifestyle (for instance the increasing trend of replacing indoor open <b>fire</b> <b>sources</b> with electrical appliances as well as the increasing general fire prevention awareness). Socioeconomic development and an urbanized lifestyle might bring along new <b>fire</b> hazard <b>sources.</b> Field program efforts to address fire risks should take note of the disassociation between disaster experiences and risk perception/preparedness behavioral intent.

40|$|Smoke back-layering flow {{length is}} {{the length of}} the {{reversed}} smoke flow upstream of the fire when the longitudinal ventilation velocity is lower than the critical velocity. This paper experimentally investigates the smoke back-layering flow length of longitudinal ventilated tunnel fires with a vertical shaft in the upstream (0. 5 - 4. 0 m from the <b>fire</b> <b>source)</b> using a 1 / 10 reduced-scale subway tunnel model. Experimental results show that the vertical shaft in the upstream can control the smoke back-layering flow length within a relatively limited range, compared to the tunnel without vertical shaft. Moreover, for the cases that the <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> is not located exactly below the vertical shaft, the most appropriate dimensionless distance between the vertical shaft and <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> is 3, resulting in the shortest smoke back-layering flow length. By introducing a concept of virtual <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> below vertical shaft, a new empirical model was further deduced to predict the smoke back-layering flow length. Its predictions fit reasonably well when the dimensionless longitudinal flow velocity is less than 0. 19. Beyond that, the predictions are little higher than the experiments, which is because some of the assumptions in this model are invalid under higher longitudinal ventilation velocity...|$|E

Numerical simulation was used to make a comparative study on SPEA motion released at different driving pressures in fire. The simulation results indicate that the converging nozzle will enhance the capacity of extinguishing agent particles to penetrate fire plume, and its penetration capacity is directly proportional to the driving pressure value. When interacting with particles, the flame height decreases and flame width increases. The larger the driving pressure, the shorter time for particles to enter into <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> area. Particle concentration value in <b>fire</b> <b>source</b> area is relatively higher at 1. 2 MPa and it less changes at 1. 0 MPa.
