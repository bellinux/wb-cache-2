25|$|Since the Rolls-Royce RB162 lift engines {{specified}} for the Mirage IIIV {{were not}} expected to be available before 1963, Dassault modified the first Mirage III prototype to serve as an interim VTOL testbed. Eight Rolls-Royce RB108 lift engines were installed, each with an average maximum takeoff thrust of 9.83kN (2,210lbf). The Mirage III's SNECMA Atar G.2 propulsion engine was replaced with an unreheated (non-afterburning) Bristol Siddeley Orpheus BOr 3 with a thrust of 21.57kN (4,850lbf). The lift engines were grouped in tandem pairs around the aircraft's center of gravity {{on either side of the}} propulsion engine's <b>intake</b> <b>duct,</b> with each pair in a row separated by the main undercarriage wheelbays.|$|E
25|$|Few aircraft, {{although}} many ramjet-powered missiles, have flown with intakes which have supersonic compression taking place inside the <b>intake</b> <b>duct.</b> These intakes, known as mixed-compression intakes, have advantages for aircraft that cruise at Mach 2.2 and higher. Most supersonic aircraft intakes compress the air externally so do not start and hence have no unstart mode. Mixed compression intakes have the initial supersonic compression externally {{and the remainder}} inside the duct. As an example, the intakes on the B-70 Valkyrie had an external compression ratio (cr) at M3 of 3.5 and internal cr about 6.6, followed by subsonic diffusion. The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird and B-70 Valkyrie had well-publicised unstart behaviour. Other aircraft that have flown with internal compression include the Vought F-8 Crusader III, the SSM-N-9 Regulus II cruise missile and the B-1 Lancer.|$|E

The RD-10 engine, rated at [...] of thrust, {{was moved to the}} front of the nose and its cowling formed the bottom of the forward fuselage. This position minimized thrust losses due to the length of the <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> and allowed the engine to be changed much more easily than its predecessor. The cockpit was widened and moved to a position over the mid-set wings, even with the engine's exhaust nozzle. The pilot's seat back was armored and he was protected by an armor plate to his front and a bulletproof windscreen. Three fuel tanks were positioned ahead of the cockpit and one behind it with a total capacity of [...] of fuel. The removable, mid-mounted wings used several different laminar flow airfoils over their span. Each wing had a single spar, slotted flaps and ailerons. The tricycle undercarriage retracted into the fuselage, which meant that the aircraft had a very narrow ground track. The aircraft was armed with three [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, two on the starboard side of the aircraft's nose and the other on the port side. Each gun had 50 rounds of ammunition.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} positive crankcase ventilation system. The crankcase ventilation system vents to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air vented from the crankcase contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and emission system. This will immediately place the vehicle into limp home mode and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a check engine light and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine oil venting occurs on the right hand side of the engine air <b>intake</b> <b>duct.</b> For this reason there is always some oil in the engine air <b>intake</b> <b>duct,</b> see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|E

50|$|The ram-air intake {{works by}} {{reducing}} the intake air velocity by increasing the cross-sectional area of the <b>intake</b> <b>ducting.</b> When gas velocity goes down the dynamic pressure is reduced, while the static pressure is increased.

5000|$|In the valveless engine, {{there will}} {{actually}} be two arrivals of rarefaction waves [...] - [...] first, from the intake and then from the tailpipe.

Its main effect is to begin flow reversal in the intake itself, in effect [...] "pre-loading" [...] the <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> with fresh outdoor air. The actual breathing of the engine as a whole will not begin in earnest until the major low pressure wave from the tailpipe reaches the combustion zone.

Extra heat exhangers were added for the differential and transmission oil to prevent overheating under extreme racing conditions. A fast-filling racing fuel cell replaced the standard gasoline tank.

50|$|An S-duct (or {{serpentine}} inlet) {{is a type}} of {{jet engine}} <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> used in several types of trijet aircraft. In this configuration, the intake is in the upper rear center of the aircraft, above or below the stabilizer, while the exhaust and engine is {{at the rear of the}} aircraft. The S-duct is located in the tail, or empennage, of the aircraft. The shape of the S-duct is distinctive and easily recognized, and was used in several aircraft, beginning in 1962 with the Hawker Siddeley Trident. Currently, the Dassault Falcon 7X and Dassault Falcon 900 business jets, and the Tupolev Tu-154M narrow-body airliner in limited production, are the only aircraft in production that use the S-duct design.|$|E
50|$|Much {{attention}} {{was given to}} aerodynamic considerations, with the body being de-guttered/seam welded {{and the use of}} filler panels for the door pillars and 935-style mirrors. Prototype models had NACA-style intercooler <b>intake</b> <b>ducts</b> over the rear fenders (later dropped, as it was discovered that air was pulled out, rather than in, at speed due to a low-pressure area), while later models had additional slots in the rear bumper corners for the air to exit.|$|R
2500|$|A {{peripheral}} {{intake port}} gives the highest mean effective pressure, however, side intake porting produces a more steady idle, {{because it helps}} to prevent blow-back of burned gases into the <b>intake</b> <b>ducts</b> which cause [...] "misfirings", caused by alternating cycles where the mixture ignites and fails to ignite. Peripheral porting (PP) gives the best mean effective pressure throughout the rpm range, but PP was linked also to worse idle stability and part-load performance. Early work by Toyota led to {{the addition of a}} fresh air supply to the exhaust port, and proved also that a Reed-valve in the <b>intake</b> port or <b>ducts</b> improved the low rpm and partial load performance of Wankel engines, by preventing blow-back of exhaust gas into the <b>intake</b> port and <b>ducts,</b> and reducing the misfire-inducing high EGR, at the cost of a small loss of power at top rpm. David W. Garside, the developer of the Norton rotary engine, who proposed that earlier opening of the intake port before top dead center (TDC), and longer <b>intake</b> <b>ducts,</b> improved low rpm torque and elasticity of Wankel engines. That is also described in Kenichi Yamamoto's books. Elasticity is also improved with a greater rotor eccentricity, analogous to a longer stroke in a reciprocating engine. Wankel engines operate better with a low-pressure exhaust system. Higher exhaust back pressure reduces mean effective pressure, more severely in peripheral intake port engines. The Mazda RX-8 Renesis engine improved performance by doubling the exhaust port area compared with earlier designs, and there has been specific study of the effect of intake and exhaust piping configuration on the performance of Wankel engines.|$|R

50|$|Etsuo Matsuki and {{his team}} {{developed}} another interesting feature to increase TDM engine torque and power: A variable <b>intake</b> <b>duct</b> effectively brings out the full potential of the new injection system. The air cleaner box will automatically adjust the air intake volume in accordance with engine rpm. Below 4000rpm the duct closes down {{about one-third of the}} intake area. The result is amazing: when suddenly opening the throttle, the new 900 twin pulls stronger than ever without any hesitation. And {{with the help of the}} injection system even on high mountain roads (up to 3000 meter!) the fuel mixture is always adjusted properly. Riders who use their bike often on higher altitude, will fully understand and appreciate these benefits. A 3-way catalytic converter is standard and reduces emissions effectively in the background.|$|E
