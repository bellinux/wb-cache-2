Using a sample of industrial companies that are included in the PROPER program and listed on the Jakarta stock exchange, and the path analysis. This study found that the role of <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mediator supports hypotheses about, the financial resources, capability, and characteristic of corporate influences on environmental performance through coporate disclosure. Although the relationship between financial resources with environment performance of the corporate is not significant. But in the context of time and involvement of the <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mediator of the relationship in the long term is positive...|$|R

This paper reports {{on the experience of}} 18 people living with HIV in the UK of disclosing their HIV+ status in arguably their most important relationship, their intimate partnership. Five main themes arose: <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> the battlefield, preparing psychologically to disclose, <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> test of the partner’s love, <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> opportunity for the partner to know them more deeply, and the renegotiation of the relationship narrative...|$|R

40|$|Section 1 {{begins by}} {{discussing}} credit card usage and {{the levels of}} debt of American consumers. Section 2 outlines the history of TILA, which was promulgated by Congress in 1968, {{as well as the}} enforcement power bestowed by Congress on the Federal Reserve Board to implement TILA. This exploration also includes descriptions of Regulation Z and the Schumer Box requirements that state exactly what information needs to be clearly and conspicuously displayed in credit card application materials as well as how the information is to be displayed for consumers to review. Section 3 discusses the recent Ninth Circuit case Rubio v. Capital One where the court decided the clarity of <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> question of law. The dissent from Rubio is also analyzed because the position taken is in accord with the Third Circuit opinion of Roberts v. Fleet Bank, where the clarity of <b>disclosure</b> was left <b>as</b> <b>a</b> question of fact for the jury. Section 4 outlines the Roberts case, and the court’s decision to analyze clarity of <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> question of fact, in more detail. The fifth and final Section recommends leaving clarity of <b>disclosure</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> question of fact to be decided by a fact-finder...|$|R

40|$|This Note {{advocates for}} the reform of the federal initial {{disclosure}} of documents rule. Plausible pleadings, mandated by Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, provide sufficient foundation to support increased use of initial <b>disclosures</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means to reduce the costs of civil discovery. The Massachusetts Superior Court Business Litigation Session’s Discovery Pilot Project pioneered a reform initial disclosure rule. The Discovery Pilot Project’s initial disclosure rule differs from the initial disclosure requirement under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in that it (i) requires actual document production and (ii) is intended <b>as</b> <b>a</b> principal document discovery tool. The federal initial disclosure of documents rule should be amended to include an actual production requirement, {{but the use of}} initial <b>disclosures</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> principal discovery tool is still too ambitious to warrant national replication...|$|R

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} <b>a</b> customer <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> of business in the accommodation industry. The {{purpose of this article}} is to examine the value of guests <b>as</b> <b>a</b> firm <b>asset</b> and to propose a model for managing guests <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> in the context of accommodation services. A guest is considered <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> due to its role in providing revenue to the accommodation firm. Because of this role, the accommodation guest needs to be managed appropriately. This article argues that guest service evaluation (i. e. service quality, perceived value, and guest satisfaction) and service loyalty are important factors in the development of guest lifetime value. The proposed model of managing guests <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>asset</b> consists of marketing instruments, service evaluation, guest loyalty, and financial outcomes provides a comprehensive guide on how accommodation firms can manage the lifetime value of their guests. Finally, as there are limited studies examining this issue, future research should test the proposed model...|$|R
