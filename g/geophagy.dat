5|$|Being {{the most}} frugivorous {{members of the}} family Lemuridae, {{consuming}} an average of 74–90% fruit, ruffed lemurs also consume nectar (4–21%), and supplement the rest of their diet with young leaves (3–6%), mature leaves (1%), flowers (3–6%), and some seeds.

5|$|<b>Geophagy,</b> the {{practice}} of eating soil or rock, has been observed in orangutans. There are three main reasons for this dietary behaviour: for the addition of mineral nutrients to their diet; for the ingestion of clay minerals that can absorb toxic substances; or to treat a disorder such as diarrhoea. Orangutans also use plants of the genus Commelina as an anti-inflammatory balm.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Africa, termites are consumed in local or tribal areas in Asia and North and South America. In Australia, Indigenous Australians {{are aware that}} termites are edible but do not consume them even in times of scarcity; there are few explanations as to why. Termite mounds are the main sources of soil consumption (<b>geophagy)</b> in many countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Researchers have suggested that termites are suitable candidates for human consumption and space agriculture, as they are high in protein {{and can be used}} to convert inedible waste to consumable products for humans.|$|E
500|$|The silky sifaka's diet {{is similar}} to that of other eastern {{rainforest}} sifakas, consisting primarily of leaves (folivory) and seeds (seed predation). [...] It is highly varied and includes many plant species. [...] A two-month study from the mid-2000s showed that the silky sifaka can feed on as many as 76species of plant from 42families. [...] Its favorites included primarily tree species, but also some lianas. [...] The most prominent plant families in the diet were Moraceae (20.30%), Fabaceae (12.87%), Myrtaceae (12.65%), Clusiaceae (10.13%) and Apocynaceae (9.49%). [...] In the study, feeding upon these four plant families took up as much as 37.06% of the total feeding time for the silky sifaka: 16.09% on the fruit of Pachytrophe dimepate, 8.43% on the seeds of Senna spp., 6.52% on the young leaves of Plectaneia thouarsii, and 6.02% on the fruit of Eugenia spp. [...] In sum, folivory accounted for 52% of the feeding time, while fruit-eating accounted for 34%, and seed predation made up 11%. The consumption of flowers, as well as soil (<b>geophagy),</b> was rarely observed in this study. [...] Prior to this, preliminary studies had reported that folivory accounted for 75% of the diet, while fruits and 15% was seed predation, 7% was flower consumption, and bark and soil made up the remainder.|$|E
2500|$|Helminths are {{transmitted}} to the final host in several ways. The most common infection is through ingestion of contaminated vegetables, drinking water, and raw or undercooked meat. Contaminated food may contain eggs of nematodes such as Ascaris, Enterobius, [...] and Trichuris; cestodes such as Taenia, Hymenolepis, and Echinococcus; and treamtodes such as Fasciola. Raw or undercooked meats are the major sources of Taenia (pork, beef and venison), Trichinella (pork and bear), Diphyllobothrium (fish), Clonorchis (fish), and Paragonimus (crustaceans). Schistosomes and nematodes such as hookworms (Ancylostoma and Necator) and Strongyloides can penetrate the skin directly. Finally, Wuchereria, Onchocerca, and Dracunculus {{are transmitted}} by mosquitoes and flies. In the developing world, the use of contaminated water is a major risk factor for infection. Infection can also take place through the practice of <b>geophagy,</b> which is not uncommon in parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Soil is eaten, for example, by children or pregnant women to counteract a real or perceived deficiency of minerals in their diet.|$|E
2500|$|Herbivores {{can avoid}} plant {{defenses}} by eating plants selectively {{in space and}} time. For the winter moth, feeding on oak leaves {{early in the season}} maximized the amount of protein and nutrients available to the moth, while minimizing the amount of tannins produced by the tree. Herbivores can also spatially avoid plant defenses. [...] The piercing mouthparts of species in Hemiptera allow them to feed around areas of high toxin concentration. Several species of caterpillar feed on maple leaves by [...] "window feeding" [...] on pieces of leaf and avoiding the tough areas, or those with a high lignin concentration. Similarly, the cotton leaf perforator selectively avoids eating the epidermis and pigment glands of their hosts, which contain defensive terpenoid aldehydes. Some plants only produce toxins in small amounts, and rapidly deploy them to the area under attack. Some beetles counter this adaptation by attacking target plants in groups, thereby allowing each individual beetle to avoid ingesting too much toxin. Some animals ingest large amounts of poisons in their food, but then eat clay or other minerals, which neutralize the poisons. This behavior is known as <b>geophagy.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{is unclear}} which {{function}} is driving avian <b>geophagy.</b> However, evidence is mounting that sodium {{is the more}} important driver among parrots in southeastern Peru. Parrots are known to eat toxic foods globally, but <b>geophagy</b> is concentrated in very specific regions. Lee et al show that parrot <b>Geophagy</b> in South America is significantly positively correlated with distance from the ocean. This suggests that overall lack of sodium in the ecosystem, not variation in food toxicity, is a better predictor of the spatial distribution of <b>geophagy</b> in this system. This work coupled with the recent findings of consistently high sodium levels in consumed soils [...] make it highly likely that sodium is the primary driver of avian <b>geophagy</b> among parrots (and possibly other taxa) in the western Amazon Basin.|$|E
5000|$|Many animals eat soil or clay, a {{behaviour}} known as <b>geophagy.</b> Clay {{is the primary}} ingredient of kaolin.

50|$|Frugivory, nectarivory and folivory {{are well}} {{understood}} in C. sphinx; in addition, <b>geophagy</b> behaviour {{has also been}} reported in this species recently, and is suggested to represent an ‘adaptive behavioural plasticity’ in the foraging behaviour of the C.sphinx. According to Mahandran et al. <b>geophagy</b> have the function of mineral supplementation and/or detoxification.|$|E
50|$|Earths and clays {{may have}} {{provided}} prehistoric peoples {{with some of}} their first medicines. This is related to <b>geophagy,</b> which is extremely widespread among animals in the wild as well as among domesticated animals. In particular, <b>geophagy</b> is widespread among contemporary non-human primates. Also, early humans could have learned {{about the use of}} various healing clays by observing animal behaviour. Such clay is used both internally and externally, such as for treating wounds, and after surgery (see below). <b>Geophagy,</b> and the external use of clay are both still quite widespread among aboriginal peoples around the world, as well as among pre-industrial populations.|$|E

50|$|Yellow-tailed woolly monkeys {{participate}} in <b>geophagy,</b> {{the consumption of}} soil. <b>Geophagy</b> is a rare biological behavior, but the species benefits since it results in trace mineral intake of minerals and reduction of intestinal parasites; they tend to suffer from an iron-deficient diet. Their consumption of soil allows them to intake iron {{that they do not}} get from their regular diet.|$|E

50|$|There {{are obvious}} risks in the {{consumption}} of ampo and clay that is contaminated by animal or human feces; in particular, parasite eggs, such as roundworm, that can stay dormant for years, can present a problem. Tetanus poses a further risk. Nevertheless, these risks are generally well understood by most tribal populations that engage in <b>geophagy,</b> hence 'clean' earth from below the surface level is sought out. Children's predilection to engage in <b>geophagy</b> makes them more susceptible to worm infestations. Other dangers associated with geophagia include damage to tooth enamel, the ingestion {{of a variety of}} bacteria, various forms of soil contamination, and intestinal obstruction.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{medicinal}} clay in {{folk medicine}} {{goes back to}} prehistoric times. Indigenous peoples around the world still use clay widely, which is related to <b>geophagy.</b> The first recorded use of medicinal clay goes back to ancient Mesopotamia.|$|E
50|$|There is a {{psychological}} hypothesis, which is centred on the cravings reported by clay eaters. Researchers' attention was directed mainly towards pregnant and postpartum {{women and their}} emotional states. <b>Geophagy</b> was attributed to feelings of misery, homesickness, depression, and alienation.|$|E

50|$|<b>Geophagy</b> is the {{practice}} of eating soil-like substances. Both animals and human cultures occasionally consume soil for medicinal, recreational, or religious purposes.
