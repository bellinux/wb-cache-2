Architect Tao Ho {{was chosen as}} one of the panel judges to pick Hong Kong's new flag. [...] He recalled that some of the designs had been rather funny and with political twists: [...] "One had a hammer and sickle {{on one side and a}} dollar sign on the other."

Six designs were chosen as finalists by the judges, but were all later rejected by the PRC. [...] Ho and two others were then asked by the PRC to submit new proposals.|$|R
