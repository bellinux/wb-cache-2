The experimental program is {{conducted in a}} laboratory flume with 10 cm wide, 31 cm deep and 3. 0 m long. A diverging channel reach with fixed length and constant divergence angle is used. Polygonal sills with constant height, constant upstream slope and variable downstream slope are used under the gate. These sills are tested under wide range of similar submerged flow conditions to investigate the effect of sill slope on the flow characteristics. Also, a particular sill is tested under different heights to address the effect of sill height on the flow characteristics. Both the effects of submergence and the under-gate Froude number on the flow below the gate are discussed. Different flow regimes are considered (Supercritical, critical and subcritical flow). It is found {{that the presence of}} sill under the gate upstream of diverging channel reach has a remarkable effect on the discharge coefficient of the gate.

The program's {{purpose was to}} assess the historical relationship between flow from the springhouse as a function of Floridan aquifer and Suwannee River levels. Anecdotal evidence indicates that discharge from White Sulphur Springs has decreased significantly over time. Springflow status was reviewed and data were analyzed to assess the quantity of springflow relative to aquifer head and river level. Regression analysis shows a strong relationship between <b>differential</b> <b>head</b> (Floridan aquifer elevation minus springpool elevation) and springflow when river conditions permit flow to occur. Using the above criteria, hindcasting was performed to April 1982, beginning date for continuous Floridan aquifer monitoring near the spring.

40|$|Lecturepg. 69 A {{submerged}} electric (SE) pump {{has been}} designed and analyzed for high flow applications. The challenges when designing a high power density SE pump are torsional and lateral dynamics and hydraulic stability. The case discussed in this paper is a single-stage pump rated for 7000 m 3 /h (31, 000 gpm) with a mixed flow impeller and <b>differential</b> <b>head</b> of 65 mlc (213 ft). The increased flow design means that the impeller/motor inertia ratio increases compared to smaller designs. It is therefore important to review the torsional vibrations during start up when having direct online start. In this case the fundamental torsional critical was {{much higher than the}} main excitation frequency during start up, hence the response can be regarded as quasistatic. The main challenge with the lateral analysis was related to rotordynamic coefficients for the fluid filled clearances in the motor and impeller. The first bending mode was related to the motor itself, but with satisfactory separation margin from the operation speed. in addition, the response was highly damped. The impeller/diffuser interaction was analyzed with regard to flow stability. The diffuser can be a source for rotating stall that again can affect both vibrations and performance. Numerical flow simulations (computational fluid dynamics, CFD) were used to analyze the performance and flow at off-design. No sign of propagating recirculation around the circumference was detected. Additionally, casing/bearing house vibration analysis showed low vibration values and stable blade passing frequencies, confirming no blade stall interaction and corresponding diffuser instability in the flow domain of interest...|$|E
40|$|Leak {{testing is}} being {{performed}} in 105 KW {{to verify the}} performance of the isolation barriers which have been recently installed. When an 11 inch <b>differential</b> <b>head</b> is established between the main basin and the discharge chute, a leak-rate of approximately 30 - 35 gpm is observed. The leak-rate would be achieved by a 1. 65 `` - 2 `` diameter hole (or equivalent). Analyses suggest that the flow is turbulent/laminar transitional (dominantly turbulent), which would be indicative of a single point leak, typical of a pipe or large opening. However, local vortex rotation is observed in the entry to the West transfer chute while no observable motion was seen in the East transfer chute: this may be an indication of seal leakage in the East isolation barrier. The potential for leakage had been considered during the design and field work planning stages. Review of potential leak detection technologies had been made; at the planning stage it was determined that location specific leak detection could be established relatively quickly, applying existing K Basins technology (dye or ultrasonics). The decision was made not to pre-stage leak detection since the equipment development is highly dependent on the nature and location of the leak, and the characteristics of the leak rate provides data which guides leak characterization technology. The expense could be deferred and potentially avoided without risk to critical path activity. Consistent with the above, a systematic recovery plan has been developed utilizing phased activities to provide for management discipline combined with timely diagnosis and correction. Because this activity is not critical path at this time, activities will be coordinated with other plant activity to optimize overall plant work. Particular care will be exercised in assuring that information gained from this recovery can be utilized in the more critical work in 105 KE...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 23 Pressurized {{gas seal}} {{technology}} has been applied successfully to many types of equipment, in various processes, and under diverse operating conditions. Using a readily available gas supply, typically nitrogen, the seal is capable of providing zero process emissions, no process contamination, and high reliability, even off-design pump operation. Recently, a discrepancy was observed during standard {{net positive suction head}} (NPSH) testing at the pump manufacturer. Under certain operating condition, normal gas seal leakage into the pump may influence pump performance. A standard pump NPSH test objective is to vaporize liquid within the impeller and to generate a measurable head loss as a direct result. When a gas seal is used in a pump NPSH test, the total <b>differential</b> <b>head</b> (TDH) is reduced for reasons other than cavitation. Before the liquid?s vapor pressure can be reached, the gas leakage across the seal faces expands and reduces the pump?s TDH by three percent or more. Although the pump test indicates a high NPSH? (the r is for required), in reality, the pump never reaches the point of cavitation. Based on standard NPSH testing, a test program documented the effect of gas leakage into the pump under varying operating conditions. While operating at both low suction pressure and low pump flowrate conditions, the effects of gas leakage are the most evident. Because these conditions are inherent in standard NPSH tests but much less common in field installations, the relevance of pump NPSH performance data should be evaluated at true conditions. The results of these tests may help pump users and pump suppliers understand the effects of gas leakage into the pump. Pump and seal operating guidelines are outlined to minimize the influence of gas and to avoid field problems...|$|E
40|$|The Fourier {{method is}} used to provide new {{analytic}} solutions for idealized mathematical models of double-element shielded magnetoresistive (MR) recording heads. The general two-dimensional model allows analysis of various recording head configurations; a single pole head, a ring head, a dual stripe head and a <b>differential</b> <b>head.</b> The analysis accommodates both longitudinal recording (with no soft magnetic underlayer present) and perpendicular recording (in {{the presence of a}} soft underlayer). Typical field, spectral response function and output voltage pulse plots for double-element MR heads are given and compared to published, approximate solutions. The integrals arising in the determination of the Fourier series coefficients, magnetic potential and magnetic field components are expressed either as rapidly convergent infinite series or in terms of special functions to provide a more efficient means of evaluation than numerical integration. It is shown that, in many situations, it is only necessary to take the first Fourier coefficient in the calculation of output voltage pulse shapes in order to achieve sufficiently accurate results. Bi-variate regression techniques are used to provide a convenient method to approximate the first Fourier series coefficient for a broad range of typical head dimensions.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the economic feasibility of photovoltaic technology to supply the entire energy demands to off-grid irrigated-farming-based communities in the arid regions. This aims at helping these communities to find practical solutions {{to cope with the}} rapid rising electricity generation costs, mainly by diesel generators (gensets). The genset electricity costs are typically affected by the high fossil fuel prices, the fuel transport costs and the intensive operation and maintenance (O&M) requirements. The work was conducted on a representative site from which conclusions could be drawn for similar regions. The case study was performed in the New Kalabsha Village in the Lake Nasser Region (LNR) in southern Egypt. The work involved the technical design and the calculation of the life cycle costs (LCC) of a PV system, which is able to supply the village with its entire energy demand. The PV generator was sized in such a way to daily pump 111 Â  000 Â m 3 of lake water to irrigate 1260 Â ha acreage plots and to electrify the adjacent village's households. The required pumps were designed to pump the fluctuating lake's water for a maximum <b>differential</b> <b>head</b> of 17 Â m in four different locations. Consequently, water from the four pumping stations flows freely by gravity forces to the different plots through overhead open canals. The electricity generation costs and the performance of the designed PV generator were compared with those of an equivalent diesel generator (genset) in order to prove its competitiveness. With this regard, the real market value of the diesel fuel of 86. 55 Â c[euro]Â l- 1 was considered for calculating the costs of genset generated electricity. The results showed that the genset electricity unit costs 39 Â c[euro]Â kWÂ h- 1 while a unit of PV electricity costs only 13 Â c[euro]Â kWÂ h- 1 for the equivalent system size and project lifetime.

Initial concepts are discussed and a system configuration is physically modelled at a laboratory scale. Outline designs using a variety of materials are developed and these provide a basis for the estimation of a probable capital cost using standard Civil Engineering methods. The proposed system is mathematically modelled using a lumped mass approach to the complex hydrodynamics. The resultant differential equations are solved by means of a variable Runge Kutta numerical analysis. The model includes the thermodynamic aspects of the system's compressible airflow. A computer program has been developed from the mathematical model and Is utilized in a series of parametric studies. An economic assessment based upon both the average power output achieved during the parametric studies and the probable capital cost of the system is presented, together with an estimate of the cost per kilowatt-hour of the electricity produced. This assessment takes into account maintenance costs, expected value of the energy produced and the possible effects of both Water Abstraction Charges and Local Authority Rating. In addition to the parametric studies a final, more rigorous optimization of the system involving a number of the many interacting variables has been undertaken. This optimization is achieved via Cumulative Evolutionary Design techniques involving the use of Genetic Algorithms. An optimal design of the chamber shape is achieved in the same manner.

40|$|Seepage {{barriers}} {{have been}} used extensively to mitigate seepage problems in dams and levees. Although the designs {{of many of these}} dams and levees have been based on intact seepage barriers, seepage barriers {{have been shown to be}} susceptible to deformation and cracking when high differential hydraulic pressures act across the barrier. Cracking and deformation have also been observed due to thermal expansion and contraction during seepage barrier curing. Under certain conditions, a crack can lead to serious seepage problems, which could potentially lead to the development of a low-resistance seepage pathway. Three scenarios have been identified where there is potential for erosion to occur adjacent to a crack in a barrier: 1) erosion at the interface between a fine-grained soil and a course-grained soil, 2) erosion of overlying soil due to flow along a joint in bedrock, and 3) erosion of the barrier material itself. Previous studies have investigated the first mode of erosion and studies are underway to look into the second mode. The objective of this study is to investigate the third mode of erosion and to identify the conditions under which serious seepage problems can develop. The question considered was whether the combination of highly permeable material adjacent to a crack in a seepage barrier and a large <b>differential</b> <b>head</b> across the barrier combine to develop a velocity within the crack that is erosive to the seepage barrier material. Laboratory tests have been performed on a variety of seepage barrier materials to assess the potential for cracks to develop a preferred seepage path leading to a serious seepage problem. The results of this study will be useful in risk assessment studies of dams and levees with existing seepage barriers as well as in the design of new seepage barriers. Having knowledge of the conditions under which problems may occur will aid in the selection of seepage barrier types for new barriers, placement of instrumentation to monitor new and existing barriers, and mitigation of existing barriers where problems have been identified. The data provided will assist engineers in quantitatively assessing the potential for the propagation of critical seepage problems from cracks in seepage barriers...|$|E

Our results also indicated that counterpulsation yields the minimum left ventricular stroke work, left ventricular end diastolic volume, and aortic pulse pressure, without significantly affecting mean cardiac output and aortic pressure...|$|R
