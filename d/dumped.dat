The geological conditions, <b>dumping</b> operation, and waste particle size distribution were investigated in the Heidaigou open pit mine.

40|$|Background: <b>Dumping</b> syndrome, {{a common}} {{complication}} of esophageal, gastric or bariatric surgery, includes {{early and late}} <b>dumping</b> symptoms. Early <b>dumping</b> occurs within 1 h after eating, when rapid emptying of food into the small intestine triggers rapid fluid shifts into the intestinal lumen and release of gastrointestinal hormones, resulting in gastrointestinal and vasomotor symptoms. Late <b>dumping</b> occurs 1 - 3 h after carbohydrate ingestion, caused by an incretin-driven hyperinsulinemic response resulting in hypoglycemia. Clinical recommendations are needed for the diagnosis and management of <b>dumping</b> syndrome. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed through February 2016. Evidence-based medicine was used to develop diagnostic and management strategies for <b>dumping</b> syndrome. Results: <b>Dumping</b> syndrome should be suspected based on concurrent presentation of multiple suggestive symptoms after upper abdominal surgery. Suspected <b>dumping</b> syndrome can be confirmed using symptom-based questionnaires, glycemia measurements and oral glucose tolerance tests. First-line management of <b>dumping</b> syndrome involves dietary modification, as well as acarbose treatment for persistent hypoglycemia. If these approaches are unsuccessful, somatostatin analogues {{should be considered in}} patients with <b>dumping</b> syndrome and impaired quality of life. Surgical re-intervention or continuous enteral feeding may be necessary for treatment-refractory <b>dumping</b> syndrome, but outcomes are variable. Conclusions: Implementation of these diagnostic and treatment recommendations may improve <b>dumping</b> syndrome management...|$|R

40|$|In July 2008, a {{self-employed}} construction contractor (the victim) sustained fatal injuries when he {{was crushed}} against the cab of a <b>dump</b> truck by the <b>dump</b> body at a residential construction site.

The property owner saw that the victim was crushed between the back of the cab and the front of the <b>dump</b> body that was in the down position.
