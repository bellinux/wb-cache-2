50|$|Biochemical studies {{indicate}} that the species diverged from the common ancestor of the <b>European</b> <b>souslik</b> and the Taurus ground squirrel, its closest living relatives, around five million years ago. This coincides {{with the formation of}} the Bosporus, and the subsequent separation of Anatolia from Europe, during the late Miocene. During the last Ice Age, they may have survived in small mountain refugia in the Anatolian region.|$|E
5000|$|There are two Nature Paths {{within the}} borders of the park: Lasy okolic Przemkowa (Przemkow Neighbourhood's Forests) and Ponds of Przemkow.Since 2010, the {{reintroduction}} of the European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus), or <b>European</b> <b>souslik</b> has been taking place in the area near Jakubowo Lubi≈Ñskie as part of the bigger reintroduction of this species in the fauna of Poland led by Polish Association for Nature Preservation [...] "Salamandra".|$|E
50|$|The European ground {{squirrel}} (Spermophilus citellus), {{also known as}} the <b>European</b> <b>souslik,</b> is a species from the squirrel family, Sciuridae. It and the speckled {{ground squirrel}} (Spermophilus suslicus) are the only European representatives of the genus Spermophilus. Like all squirrels, it {{is a member of the}} rodent order. It is to be found throughout eastern Europe from southern Ukraine, to Asia Minor, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia and north as far as Poland but the range is divided in two parts by the Carpathian Mountains.|$|E
50|$|The fur is {{uniform in}} colour {{over most of}} the body, and does not have the darker {{markings}} found in neighbouring species such as the <b>European</b> <b>souslik.</b> Asia Minor ground squirrels are typically buff in colour, but may vary from greyish to dark brown. The underside and limbs are somewhat paler {{than the rest of the}} body, often being yellowish in colour. The only clear markings are narrow white rings around the eyes, and a white patch on the chin and throat. Females have eight or ten teats, and both sexes possess scent-producing anal glands.|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} of grasslands for agriculture has triggered a serious {{decline of the}} European ground squirrel or souslik Spermophilus citellus, categorized as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996. The Jakupica phylogeographic lineage of central Macedonia is {{the smallest of the}} three major evolutionary lines of the <b>European</b> <b>souslik.</b> This lineage is an important reservoir of within-species diversity and should be regarded as an independent unit for conservation management purposes. It is endemic to Mount Jakupica, where it lives in mountain pastures at 1, 500 - 2, 250 m altitude. The total area occupied by sousliks (884 ha) is fragmented and 94 % of individuals occur in four colonies. Densities (0. 8 - 5. 5 adults ha- 1) are lower than those reported elsewhere for the species, with the total population probably, 2, 000 adults. One large colony, reportedly of c. 1, 000 sousliks, was decimated in 2007 by a catastrophic fire and had still not recovered bz 2010. A steady decline in livestock grazing, together with the predicted advance of the tree line as a consequence of climate change, will probably reduce the optimal habitat for the souslik and negatively affect population fitness. Monitoring needs to be implemented, at least for the largest colonies, to provide early warning of any decline...|$|E
