500|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} German boy who Leto had {{previously}} met in Berlin. He spoke {{about the loss of}} his father and how he had played a Thirty Seconds to Mars song at the funeral. After Leto again met the German fan again at a concert in Austria, he asked him to share his story on camera. Leto explained, [...] "At the show in Austria, where there were tens of thousands of people, and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> him and interviewed him; he was the first interview of the summer, and he shared this story about losing his father, and what it taught him, it was really an organic and serendipitous and beautiful way to begin. He shared a really personal part of himself and we're really grateful to him, and that continued throughout all the interviews." ...|$|E
500|$|At age 10, Ryder and {{her family}} moved on again, this time to Petaluma, California. During her first week at Kenilworth Junior High, she was bullied {{by a group of}} her peers who mistook her for an effeminate, scrawny boy. [...] "I was wearing an old Salvation Army shop boy’s suit. As I went to the {{bathroom}} I heard people saying, ‘Hey, faggot’. They slammed my head into a locker. I fell to the ground and they started to kick the shit out of me. I had to have stitches. The school kicked me out, not the bullies... Years later, I went to a coffee shop and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> one of the girls who’d kicked me, and she said, ‘Winona, Winona, can I have your autograph?’ And I said, ‘Do you remember me? Remember in seventh grade you beat up that kid?’ And she said, ‘Kind of’. And I said, ‘That was me. Go fuck yourself.’" [...] As a result, Ryder ended up being home-schooled that year.|$|E
500|$|Although Drymon had a {{significant}} influence on SpongeBob SquarePants, he was not initially offered a role on the series. As a late recruit to Rocko's Modern Life, he had not established much of a relationship with Hillenburg before SpongeBobs conception. Hillenburg first sought out Drymon's storyboard partner, Mark O'Hare - but O'Hare had just created the soon-to-be syndicated comic strip, Citizen Dog, and while he would later join SpongeBob as a writer, lacked {{the time to get}} involved with both projects at the outset. Drymon has said, [...] "I remember Hillenburg's bringing it up to Mark in our office and asking him if he'd be interested in working on it...I was all ready to say yes to the offer, but Steve didn't ask; he just left the room. I was pretty desperate...so <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the hall after him and basically begged him for the job. He didn't jump at the chance." [...] Once Hillenburg had given it some thought and decided to bring Drymon on as creative director, the two began meeting at Hillenburg's house multiple times a week to develop the series. Drymon has identified this period as having begun in 1996, shortly after the end of Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E

500|$|Elena Pignatti, who had {{employed}} Morisi {{after she}} left the Mortaras in 1857—her words about Morisi's misconduct had formed part of the Mortaras' appeal to the Pope—testified that [...] "seven or eight years ago... a son of the Mortaras, whose name I don't know, became sick, and {{it was said that}} he was going to die. Around then, one morning... <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> Morisi. Among the other things we talked about, she—without mentioning the child's illness—asked me, 'I've heard that if you baptise a Jewish child who's about to die he goes to Heaven and gets indulgence; isn't that right?' I don't remember what I told her, but when the Mortara boy was kidnapped by order of the Dominican Father, I was sure that he must have been the one who was sick". Pignatti said that she had herself seen Edgardo during his illness, and Marianna sitting by the crib—"Since his mother was crying, and despaired for his life, I thought he was dying, also because of his appearance: his eyes were closed, and he was hardly moving." [...] She added that during the three months when Morisi worked for her in late 1857, the servant had been summoned to San Domenico four or five times, and had said that the inquisitor had promised her a dowry.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{commercial}} failure of [...] "Ain't It Hard", Reprise Records {{was encouraged by}} the group's effort, and signed the band to a recording contract that left them under Hassinger's authority. Weakley departed the band after the single, {{and was replaced by}} Preston Ritter, and rhythm guitarist James [...] "Weasel" [...] Spagnola was recruited to make The Electric Prunes a quintet. Although the band was composing their own material, Hassinger called upon songwriters Annette Tucker and Nancie Mantz to write the majority of the group's songs. The new line-up recorded six demos at American Recording Studio and Leon Russell's studio. These mainly comprised cover songs and Tucker-Mantz compositions. According to Lowe, while at Russell's recording studio, [...] "Dave cued up a tape and didn't hit 'record,' and the playback in the studio was way up: ear-shattering vibrating jet guitar. Ken had been shaking his Bigsby wiggle stick with some fuzztone and tremolo {{at the end of the}} tape. Forward it was cool. Backward it was amazing. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the control room and said, 'What was that?' They didn't have the monitors on so they hadn't heard it. I made Dave cut if off and save it for later." [...] The fluttering buzz sound was utilized for the opening to the Tucker-Mantz song, [...] "I Had Too Much To Dream (Last Night)", which also included a heavily-textured psychedelic guitar motif. The song was chosen to be released as The Electric Prunes' second single in November 1966. It peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number 49 on the UK Singles Chart. The success of the single prompted immediate touring, and earned the group a promotional contract with musical equipment makers Vox. Williams recorded an advert, demonstrating the use of Vox's wah-wah pedal in early 1967, and the band was featured in magazines such as Vox Teen Beat.|$|E
500|$|The Mavericks swept Kevin Garnett and the Minnesota Timberwolves in {{the first}} round of the 2002 NBA Playoffs 3–0: Nowitzki outscored Garnett with 33.3 points per game versus 24.0. In the second round, the Mavericks met the Sacramento Kings with rival power forward Chris Webber. After {{splitting}} the first two games, Kings coach Rick Adelman changed his defensive scheme: before, Webber had defended Nowitzki one-on-one, but now, the Kings coach ordered his smaller but quicker player Hedo Türkoğlu to cover Nowitzki. Türkoğlu would use his agility to play Nowitzki tightly, and if the taller Maverick tried to post up Türkoğlu, Webber would double team Nowitzki. In Game 3 in Dallas, the Mavericks lost, 125–119; Nowitzki scored only 19 points and said: [...] "I simply could not pass Türkoğlu, and if I did, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> a double team and committed too many turnovers." [...] In Game 4, more frustration awaited the German: the Mavericks gave away a 14-point lead, although the entire Kings starting frontcourt of center Vlade Divac and power forward Chris Webber (both fouled out) and small forward Peja Stojaković (injury) were eliminated in the closing stages of the game. Nowitzki missed two potentially game deciding jump shots, and the Mavericks lost, 115–113, at home. In Game 5, the demoralised Mavericks were no match for the spirited Kings, lost, 114–101, and were eliminated again. Among others, nba.com remarked that the Kings defended better than the Mavericks: in those five games, the statisticians counted 115 Sacramento layups against the Mavericks, meaning the Kings averaged 23 uncontested baskets (i.e., 46 easy points) per game. However, Nowitzki received a consolation award: the Gazzetta dello Sport voted him as [...] "European Basketballer of the Year", his 104 votes lifting him over second-placed Dejan Bodiroga (54) and Stojakovic (50).|$|E

2500|$|According to Swift, {{she wrote}} the song [...] "about an awkward {{situation}} where, well... Let me just preface by saying that I have happened to run into exes in strange places lately.

I was seated a couple of seats {{away from him and}} there was so much that needed to be said, and neither one of us was willing to say it. We were both acting like we were engaged in conversations with people that we don't even know. It was just miserable. I was telling my Mom about it later, and I said I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room. And then I was like, [...] "Gotta go. Bye!" [...] And my Mom is used to that at this point so, that's what this song is about." ...|$|E

I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E

5000|$|In June 2010 Jim Lynch {{reviewed}} Lubuntu 10.04, saying, [...] "One thing you’ll notice {{about using}} the Lubuntu desktop is that it’s fast. Very, very fast.

It’s {{one of the best}} things about this distro; it leaves behind the bloated eye candy that can sometimes bog down GNOME and KDE... <b>I</b> didn’t <b>run</b> <b>into</b> any noticeable problems with Lubuntu. It was very fast and stable, and I didn’t see noticeable bugs or problems. I hate it when this happens since it’s so much more interesting for my readers when <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>into</b> one nasty problem or another. Hopefully the next version of Lubuntu will be chock full of horrendous problems and bugs. Just kidding." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hou Junji was resentful that, {{despite his}} great achievement, {{he was put}} under arrest, albeit briefly. [...] In the spring of 643, when fellow general Zhang Liang was sent out of the capital {{to serve as the}} commandant at Luo Prefecture (洛州, roughly modern Luoyang, Henan), Hou tried to provoke Zhang by asking him, [...] "Who {{squeezed}} you out?" [...] Zhang, in jest, responded, [...] "Other than you, who can squeeze me out?" [...] Hou responded, [...] "I conquered a kingdom, but <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> someone throwing a temper tantrum big enough to overturn a house. [...] What strength do I have to squeeze you out?" [...] He then rolled up his sleeves and yelled, [...] "I am so unhappy that I would rather die. [...] Do you want to commit treason? [...] I will commit treason with you!" [...] Zhang secretly reported this exchange to Emperor Taizong, but Emperor Taizong pointed out that this was a private conversation with no corroboration, and took no action on it.|$|E
2500|$|As in Standard German, Pennsylvania German uses three genders (masculine, {{feminine}} and neuter). Pronouns inflect for four cases, as in Standard German, but the nominative and accusative articles and adjective endings are the same, e.g., [...] "der" [...] in Pennsylvania German {{does not become}} [...] "den" [...] in the accusative, like it does in High German. As in other South German and West German dialects, the genitive is often replaced by a special construction using the dative and the possessive pronoun: [...] "the man's dog" [...] becomes [...] "em Mann sei Hund" [...] (literally: [...] "to the man his dog"). In most regions, the dative has been gradually replaced by the accusative, so that [...] "em Mann sei Hund" [...] (the man's dog), for example, has frequently become [...] "der Mann sei Hund". Adjectival endings exist, but are somewhat simplified compared to Standard German. As in all other South German dialects, the past tense is generally expressed using the perfect: [...] "Ich bin ins Feld glaafe" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>into</b> the field) rather than the simple past ("Ich lief ins Feld"). The use of the subjunctive, while it exists, is more limited than in Standard German.|$|E
2500|$|In 640, Zhang was {{recalled}} to {{the capital}} Chang'an {{to serve as the}} minister of public works. In 641, he was made the head of the household for Emperor Taizong's son and crown prince, Li Chengqian, but was also sent out of the capital to serve as the commandant at Luo Prefecture (洛州, i.e., Luoyang). The general Hou Junji, who was unhappy that he had been briefly imprisoned on accusations of embezzlement after he conquered Gaochang, tried to instigate Zhang by asking him, [...] "Who squeezed you out?" [...] Zhang, in jest, responded, [...] "Other than you, who can squeeze me out?"

[...] Zhang secretly reported this exchange to Emperor Taizong, but Emperor Taizong pointed out that this was a private conversation with no corroboration, and took no action on it. After Hou was revealed to have plotted with Li Chengqian to overthrow Emperor Taizong in 643, Li Chengqian was deposed and exiled, while Hou was executed. Because Zhang had previously warned Emperor Taizong about Hou, Emperor Taizong rewarded him by recalling him {{to the capital}} to serve as the minister of justice and also bestowing him the additional designation of Canyu Chaozheng (參豫朝政), making him a de facto chancellor. (Earlier in 643, when Emperor Taizong commissioned the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion to commemorate the 24 great contributors to Tang rule, Zhang's was one of the portraits commissioned.) ...|$|E
