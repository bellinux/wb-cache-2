It was his first homer since {{returning}} from being hit by Wang, and Youkilis said his wrist [...] "felt a lot better as the days have progressed. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{thing about it is}} that it's playoff time, and adrenaline helps the most."

500|$|Although {{the band}} is of German origin, their music {{is based on the}} American style of death metal. Drummer Lille Gruber explained, [...] "Blues and rock music was {{developed}} in the U.S., that means it all goes back to this country.

[...] When asked about the difference in terms of sound and direction between Psalms of the Moribund and Prelude to the Tragedy, Gruber stated, [...] "We got our own style on Psalms to the Moribund where Prelude to the Tragedy had very obvious hints of the bands we idolized. Psalms of the Moribund splits in two extremes, it went more chunky, brutal, thick and deep, {{but at the same time}} that math-approach and the technicality went up a lot!" ...|$|E

Television Without Pity rated it an A, while The A.V. Club's Noel Murray gave the episode an A-, explaining [...] "This was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> Fringe of the season, and I’m only docking it a notch because it was less about themes and character than it was about plot. But man, what a plot". Various critics lauded Noble's performance. Website blogger io9 listed [...] "Grey Matters" [...] {{as one of the few}} [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show. In January 2013, IGN ranked the episode the sixth best of the entire series, explaining that the [...] "story is brilliant, with twists and turns and remarkable acting by both John Noble and Joshua Jackson as they portray a bond that's closer than anything else up to that point... This fantastic episode was an early Christmas present for Fringe fans." ...|$|E

Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi said after the match, [...] "My generation can't compare him to Maradona that's for my generation, because of what Maradona did for Argentine football. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> player ever played today here in the United States." [...] Messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind Eduardo Vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more Man of the Match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the Golden Ball Award for best player, which went to Alexis Sánchez.|$|E

2500|$|On May 27, 2011, Pippen {{generated}} {{a great deal}} of criticism by saying that Miami Heat star LeBron James may be a better player than Michael Jordan. This came only a day after the Heat beat the Bulls 4 games to 1 to advance to the 2011 NBA Finals. Pippen said: [...] "Michael Jordan is probably the greatest scorer to ever play the game. I may go so far as saying LeBron James may be the greatest player to ever play the game."
