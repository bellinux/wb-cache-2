5|$|Since the FairTax {{would not}} tax used <b>goods,</b> {{some critics have}} argued that this would create a {{differential}} between the price of new and used <b>goods,</b> which may take years to equalize. Such a differential would certainly influence the sale of new <b>goods</b> like vehicles and homes. Similarly, some supporters have claimed that this would create an incentive to buy used <b>goods,</b> creating environmental benefits of re-use and re-sale. Conversely, {{it is argued that}} like the income tax system that contains embedded tax cost (see Theories of retail pricing), used <b>goods</b> would contain the embedded FairTax cost. While the FairTax would not be applied to the retail sales of used <b>goods,</b> the inherent value of a used good includes the taxes paid when the good was sold at retail. The value is determined by the supply and demand in relation to new <b>goods.</b> The price differential / margins between used and new <b>goods</b> should stay consistent, as the cost and value of used <b>goods</b> are in direct relationship to the cost and value of the new <b>goods.</b>|$|E

5|$|Coffin {{moved to}} the Cincinnati area in 1847, where {{he took over the}} {{management}} of a wholesale warehouse of free-labor <b>goods.</b> With the intention of returning to Newport, Indiana, after fulfilling his obligation in Cincinnati, Coffin rented out his Newport business and made arrangements for his Indiana home to continue serving as an Underground Railroad stop. At Cincinnati his first task was working with the eastern organizations to set up a steady supply of free-labor <b>goods</b> for the business. The enterprise's ongoing problem was the poor quality of its <b>goods.</b> Coffin had difficulty procuring free <b>goods,</b> such as cotton, sugar, and spices, whose quality was competitive with the <b>goods</b> produced by slave labor. With inferior quality <b>goods</b> to sell, he had a difficult time finding purchasers for the <b>goods.</b> The problem plagued the business for years, causing the enterprise constant financial struggles.|$|E
