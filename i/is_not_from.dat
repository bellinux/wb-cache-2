5|$|Meanwhile, the {{homicide}} department is requiring all the detectives to take sensitivity training with therapist Carry Westin (Jennifer Mendenhall). While {{most of them}} have positive experiences with her, Bolander (Ned Beatty) flatly refuses to participate and repeatedly avoids their scheduled sessions. When Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Bolander he will be suspended without pay if he does not meet with her, Bolander chooses the suspension, but later reconsiders after his partner Munch (Richard Belzer) harasses him at the bar until he changes his mind. When they finally meet, Bolander explains he does not trust therapists because when going through marriage counseling with his ex-wife, the therapist actively encouraged her to leave Bolander. He feels he was cheated out of $7,000 in therapy bills, but Westin explains his anger <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> the money, but from feelings of betrayal by his ex-wife. Bolander is ultimately impressed by Westin and even decides to ask her on a date, but she strongly hints she is a lesbian.|$|E
5|$|This {{language}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> the Court’s {{opinion in}} Lucas v. Earl. Instead, {{it is an}} almost direct quotation from page 17 of the taxpayer's brief filed in the case. Guy C. Earl was the taxpayer, and the brief was written by Earl’s attorneys: Warren Olney Jr., J.M. Mannon, Jr., and Henry D. Costigan. In some printed versions of the case, this statement and other quotations and paraphrases from pages 8, 10, 14, 15, 17, and 18 of the taxpayer's brief are re-printed as a headnote or syllabus above {{the opinion of the}} Court. In the case reprints that include this headnote (and many of them do not even show it), these excerpts are not clearly identified as being from the taxpayer's brief. A person not trained in analysis of legal materials would not necessarily know that this verbiage, like any headnote or syllabus, {{is not part of the}} Court’s opinion, perhaps leading to the confusion about the source of the quotation. As explained below, the Supreme Court rejected the arguments in the quotation, and the taxpayer lost the case.|$|E

25|$|Since most vinyl records contain up to 30% {{recycled}} vinyl, impurities can {{accumulate in}} the record and cause even a brand-new record to have audio artifacts such as clicks and pops.

25|$|There {{are many}} place names {{containing}} the element chad or something similar. In many cases, {{reference to the}} early forms of the name suggests that the derivation <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> the name Chad, but from some other word. It is possible that even where a name might reasonably be thought to derive from Chad that the individual is some other of the same name. Hence great caution needs to be exercised in explaining ancient toponyms by reference to St Chad.|$|E

25|$|George Ramos of the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that many Cypress Park residents were {{angered by the}} negative portrayal of their community in the media; the perceived {{lack of attention to}} gang issues from the municipal government and their council member, Mike Hernandez; and the Los Angeles Times for posting large images of Stephanie Kuhen and her brother {{on the front page of}} the newspaper, stating that the media does not do this with ethnic minority children. Ramos said that the editor of the newspaper had asked for the images of the children to be posted before learning that they were white. Ramos also stated that many Cypress Park residents believed that if one <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> Cypress Park, one should be concerned with crime in his or her own neighborhood rather than in Cypress Park.|$|E
25|$|Winifred Banks – {{the wife}} of George Banks, and mother to Jane and Michael. In the musical and film, she is {{presented}} as a society woman. In the film, she is a suffragette and involved in social causes. In the musical, she is a former actress. Her family and maiden name are not mentioned, however in the books, she has two aunts that are mentioned, Aunt Flossie and Aunt Caroline. In the musical, Winifred is shown to be confused and overwhelmed with her family and her role in it. It is hinted that she did not grow up in the same strict manor as her husband, perhaps she did not even have a nanny as a child, and <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>from</b> this area, which makes it difficult for her to connect and make friends. In the original books, she has five children instead of two, including the twins, John and Barbara, and later a baby, Annabel.|$|E
