5|$|In September 2003, McLeod {{represented}} Canada at the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup {{though she}} did not make an appearance during the tournament. Following the tournament, McLeod moved to Vancouver to live with another goalkeeper {{in order to gain}} more practice and improve <b>her</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kuznetsova {{received}} {{training at}} the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Barcelona, Spain {{from the age of}} 14 and was coached under direction of club president Emilio Sánchez and Sergio Casal. Her major coaching relationship was with Stefan Ortega who was a regular guest in her player's box and helped advance <b>her</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
5|$|Team World and Team North America {{began the}} event with women's team play. Mirjam Ott and Allison Pottinger played a high-scoring game which {{resulted}} in a win for Ott, and Eve Muirhead scored an early lead over Heather Nedohin and held it to win another point for Team World. Jennifer Jones made a precise draw to tie <b>her</b> <b>game</b> with Margaretha Sigfridsson and secured a half-point for Team North America, averting a sweep by Team World.|$|E
5000|$|At the 2006 Players' Championships, Scott {{scored a}} rare [...] "eight-ender" [...] {{in one of}} <b>her</b> <b>games</b> against Cathy King.|$|R
5000|$|... k is {{best known}} for <b>her</b> <b>games</b> LIM, HUGPUNX as well as Consensual Torture Simulator. She said that the theme of <b>her</b> <b>games</b> is [...] "the {{capacity}} of digital games to convey care relationships; either to provide a sense of care to the player or to invest her in the project of caring for another." [...] She {{is also the author of}} Internet fiction and zines such as Dear Pauline and These Were Free On My Blog.|$|R
5000|$|Electronica a.k.a. Polly Pixel (Grey DeLisle) - A former {{video game}} {{designer}} furious {{over the fact}} that players constantly beat <b>her</b> <b>games</b> using cheating devices.|$|R
5|$|After {{settling}} {{down at the}} landlady's house, Vanaja gets invited {{to play a game}} of ashta chamma (a leisurely game in rural towns of Andhra Pradesh) against the landlady. Knowing that losing isn’t the mistress’s forte, she deliberately gives up <b>her</b> <b>game.</b> This gesture, in turn, eventually secures her the landlady’s mentorship, first in music and then in dance. Vanaja excels at these art forms and seems to be on a steadily ascending path until the arrival of Shekhar (Karan Singh), the landlady's 23-year-old son, from the United States. Shekhar is a handsome, muscular young man who is running for an office in the local government. Sexual chemistry is ignited between Shekhar and Vanaja (still a minor at 15) when flirtation and sexual innuendo bloom.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Alison and Diana Gordon {{are being}} held captive in their home by Zep, who is {{watching}} Adam and Lawrence through a camera behind a two-way mirror in the bathroom. The house is simultaneously being watched by Tapp, who has since been discharged from the force. Flashbacks show that Tapp became obsessed with the Jigsaw case after hearing Amanda's testimony, and eventually found Jigsaw's warehouse using the videotape from <b>her</b> <b>game.</b> He and Sing entered the warehouse, where they apprehended Jigsaw and saved a man from a drill trap, but Jigsaw escaped after non-fatally slashing Tapp's throat, and Sing {{was killed by a}} quadruple shotgun walkway while pursuing him. Convinced that Lawrence is Jigsaw, Tapp began stalking him after his discharge.|$|E
5|$|Although The Landlord's Game was patented, {{and some}} hand-made boards were made, {{it was not}} {{actually}} manufactured and published until 1906. Magie and two other Georgists established the Economic Game Company of New York, which began publishing <b>her</b> <b>game.</b> Magie submitted an edition published by the Economic Game Company to Parker Brothers around 1910, which George Parker declined to publish. In the UK, {{it was published in}} 1913 by the Newbie Game Company under the title Brer Fox an' Brer Rabbit. Shortly after the game's formal publication, Scott Nearing, a professor in what was then known as the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, began using the game as a teaching tool in his classes. His students made their own boards, and taught the game to others. After Nearing was dismissed from the Wharton School, he began teaching at the University of Toledo. A former student of Nearing, Rexford Guy Tugwell, also taught The Landlord's Game at Wharton, and took it with him to Columbia University. Apart from commercial distribution, it spread by word of mouth and was played in slightly variant homemade versions over the years by Quakers, Georgists, university students (including students at Smith College, Princeton, and MIT), and others who became aware of it.|$|E

5|$|Players can add non-Steam {{games to}} their libraries, {{allowing}} {{the game to}} be easily accessed from the Steam client and providing support where possible for Steam Overlay features. The Steam interface allows for user-defined shortcuts to be added. In this way, third-party modifications and games not purchased through the Steam Store can use Steam features. Valve sponsors and distributes some modifications free-of-charge; and modifications that use Steamworks can also use VAC, Friends, the server browser, and any Steam features supported by their parent game. For most games launched from Steam, the client provides an in-game overlay that can be accessed by a keystroke. From the overlay, the user can access his or her Steam Community lists and participate in chat, manage selected Steam settings, and access a built-in web browser without having to exit the game. Since the beginning of February 2011 as a beta version, the overlay also allows players to take screenshots of the games in process; it automatically stores these and allows the player to review, delete, or share them during or after his or <b>her</b> <b>game</b> session. As a full version on February 24, 2011, this feature was reimplemented so that users could share screenshots on websites of Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit straight from a user's screenshot manager.|$|E
25|$|Navratilova had an attacking {{serve and}} volley. Under Renée Richards, she {{improved}} <b>her</b> <b>game</b> tactics.|$|E
25|$|Kanepi {{builds up}} <b>her</b> <b>game</b> around her {{powerful}} groundstrokes. Her serve {{is considered to}} be one of the strongest on the WTA tour. Kanepi frequently hits 170km/h to 180km/h serves. She generally serves for power and tries to hit the lines but sometimes hits a powerful body serve to push her opponents behind the baseline. But sometimes her serve can break down which affects <b>her</b> <b>game.</b> In 2008, she began to improve her volleying skills and under her coach Luca Appino begun to use sliced backhand more often thus making her playing more versatile.|$|E
5000|$|Horrorshow {{gave up on}} {{her initial}} {{attempts}} to become a game developer after finding it too complex. Years later, she became interested again after playing a Twine game. Horrorshow's art style is influenced by early 3D video games, such as Doom, Hexen, Thief, and EverQuest, citing their ability to create immersive worlds while still remaining unmistakably computer-generated. [...] Owen Vince of Kill Screen compares the stylistic, low-polygon graphics in <b>her</b> <b>games</b> to that of German Expressionism, specifically The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. [...] <b>Her</b> <b>games</b> often lack characters with whom to interact, but focus instead on dreamlike scenes to explore. She avoids jump scares and player death, as she finds them uninteresting. To scare players, she uses elements of psychological horror, such as leaving disturbing scenes unexplained and open to interpretation. [...] Commenting {{on the lack of}} jump scares in <b>her</b> <b>games,</b> Brendan Caldwell of Rock, Paper, Shotgun wrote, [...] "These games creep up on you slowly and rattle your brain, not your instincts." ...|$|R
50|$|After a January 1936 {{interview}} with her {{appeared in a}} Washington D. C. newspaper, {{in which she was}} somewhat critical of Parker Brothers, they agreed to publish two more of <b>her</b> <b>games.</b>|$|R
50|$|She {{clinched}} World championship title {{three more}} times, in 1987, 1989 and 1993. Her victory in Rosmalen in 1989 was particularly impressive as {{she managed to}} win all <b>her</b> <b>games</b> at that championship.|$|R
25|$|Kvitová also {{possesses}} notable {{amount of}} variety in <b>her</b> <b>game.</b> Her volleys {{tend to come}} more from her forehand, her stronger side, which she executes by moving her racket in a straight line, also allowing her to disguise the shot well enough from her opponents. In the slice department, she {{has the ability to}} keep the ball low and performs the shot better on her backhand wing. Due to her tall frame, she is known to make up for her lack of speed by playing close to the baseline. <b>Her</b> <b>game</b> suits the fast courts and she cites grass as her favourite surface.|$|E
25|$|While Hayley {{was not in}} {{any serious}} danger of being fired, Lord Sugar warned {{her that she had}} slipped into the {{background}} since winning as project manager on the first task, and that she needed to step up <b>her</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because she predicates <b>her</b> <b>game</b> on power, Sharapova's {{preferred}} surfaces {{early in}} her career were the fast-playing hard and grass courts, as evident through her 25 victories on hard court and grass court. This was most notable when she won the 2004 Wimbledon, 2006 U.S. Open and 2008 Australian Open crowns, where she had her career breakthrough and played her peak tennis level, respectively.|$|E
6000|$|... "Many hundreds, noble gentleman; {{and report}} speaks of {{thousands}} that are collecting at Vévey {{and in the}} neighboring villages. The country of Vaud {{has not had a}} richer harvest from <b>her</b> <b>games</b> this many a year." ...|$|R

50|$|A right-arm off-break bowler, Lamason {{played in}} four women's Test matches in 1947/8 and 1954, captaining New Zealand in two. All <b>her</b> <b>games</b> were against England, {{and she was}} never on the winning side, losing both the games she captained.|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} Monopoly {{can be traced}} back to 1903, when American anti-monopolist Elizabeth Magie created a game through which she hoped to be able to explain the single tax theory of Henry George. It was {{intended}} as an educational tool to illustrate the negative aspects of concentrating land in private monopolies. Magie took out a patent in 1904. <b>Her</b> <b>game,</b> The Landlord's Game, was self-published, beginning in 1906.|$|E
25|$|During {{the grass}} season, {{she reached the}} quarterfinals in Birmingham. At Wimbledon, {{she was one of}} six seeded female players to be knocked out in the first round, losing to Jana Čepelová in three sets. During her match against Čepelová, Halep {{suffered}} a blister on the middle toe of her left foot. After Wimbledon, Halep took a couple of weeks off to regroup and make <b>her</b> <b>game</b> stronger again.|$|E
25|$|Li Na {{was born}} on 26 February 1982 in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Her mother is Li Yanping (李豔萍); her father, Li Shengpeng (李盛鵬), was a {{professional}} badminton player and later worked as a sales rep for an Wuhan-based company. He died from a rare cardiovascular disease when Li was fourteen. Her mother didn't tell Li Na {{that her father had}} died for many weeks, thinking it would affect <b>her</b> <b>game.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fabienne Weber is a German {{football}} goalkeeper. From 2011 to 2016 {{she was on}} {{the bench}} of the first team of Bayern Munich several times as a reserve goalkeeper, although the majority of <b>her</b> <b>games</b> she played with the reserve team.|$|R
50|$|She {{has been}} honoured many times by her country and several postage stamps {{have even been}} {{designed}} to celebrate her chess achievements. Mongolia issued a commemorative stamp in 1986 which illustrates a position in one of <b>her</b> <b>games</b> from the 1984 world championship match against Irina Levitina.|$|R
50|$|She played <b>her</b> last <b>game</b> on 28 May 1998.|$|R
25|$|At the Beijing Olympics, {{following}} early-round victories against world No. 3 Svetlana Kuznetsova, Ayumi Morita, and Kaia Kanepi, {{she went}} on to defeat one of the favourites, Venus Williams, in the quarterfinals. Li was trailing 1–4 in the first set, but managed to strengthen <b>her</b> <b>game</b> to win in straight sets. Li lost her semifinal match to sixth seed Dinara Safina and was then defeated in the bronze final by Vera Zvonareva. At the following US Open, Li was defeated by the Beijing Olympics gold medalist Elena Dementieva in the fourth round.|$|E
25|$|Energa Toruń next faced {{off against}} faced Siemens AGD on November 22, 2007. Lindsay stepped up <b>her</b> <b>game</b> and scored 16 points and made 9 rebounds. This was {{made all the}} more {{impressive}} in comparison with the other players as she only played for a total of only 20 minutes in the game. However, Lindsay was not as defensive as previous games and only made 2 blocked shots. Energa {{went on to win the}} match with Energa's 85 points to Siemens AGD's score of 64. Unfortunately it wasn't a league game, it was a Cup qualifier.|$|E
25|$|Their {{most notable}} meeting to date {{was in the}} final of the 2013 Australian Open. Both players entered the {{championship}} match with one Grand Slam title each (Azarenka who the 2012 Australian Open, whilst Li won the 2011 French Open), and in very good form, with Azarenka only dropping one set throughout her run and Li Na having not dropped a set and also having defeated two top four players (Agnieszka Radwańska and Maria Sharapova) en route. After Li Na won the first set, Azarenka stepped up <b>her</b> <b>game</b> as Li started to suffer multiple injuries, and eventually won in three sets to successfully defend her Australian Open title and become the first world No. 1 to win a Major since Serena Williams won Wimbledon in 2010.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, {{while playing}} at the USA Cup in Minnesota, she met and was scouted by Philippines men's {{national}} team coach Aris Caslib who watched some of <b>her</b> <b>games.</b> On October 2005, the Philippine Football Federation contacted her and team manager Ernie Nierras invited her to the women's national team.|$|R
