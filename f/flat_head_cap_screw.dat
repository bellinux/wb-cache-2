5000|$|A {{counterbore}} (symbol: ⌴) is a cylindrical flat-bottomed {{hole that}} enlarges another coaxial hole, or the tool {{used to create}} that feature. A counterbore hole is typically used when a fastener, such as a socket <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screw,</b> is required to sit flush with or {{below the level of}} a workpiece's surface.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of joint between shell and arbor {{involves}} a fairly large cylindrical feature at center (to locate the shell concentric to the arbor) and two driving lugs or tangs that drive the shell with a positive engagement (like a dog clutch).

5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male hexagonal head of a bolt or nut fastener. The {{opposite end of the}} socket wrench has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the socket wrench's drive size. Male drivers are also produced for use with socket <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screws,</b> and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:. In the {{condition}} of alternating impact,the nut-supports subassembly is analyzed according to uncertainty of design parameters. Firstly, a three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element (FE) model of the nut-supports subassembly is built and is meshed,and the constraints and loads are imposed. Secondly,the model of nut-supports was assembled using the software ANSYS to understand the stress distribution and {{various parts of the}} deformation of the nut-supports and its weak links in the harmonic forces. Finally,socket <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> has not enough pre-load in {{the condition}} of alternating impact and will be simplified. It is analyzed and checked whether it is cut or not; which provides the reference data for design and optimization of the wave maker...|$|R
40|$|Torque tension {{testing of}} a newly {{designed}} Reusable Solid Rocket Motor nozzle bolted assembly was successfully completed. Test {{results showed that the}} 3 -sigma preload variation was as expected at the required input torque level and the preload relaxation were within the engineering limits. A shim installation technique was demonstrated as a simple process to fill a shear lip gap between nozzle housings in the joint region. A new automated torque system was successfully demonstrated in this test. This torque control tool was found to be very precise and accurate. The bolted assembly performance was further evaluated using the Nozzle Structural Test Bed. Both current socket <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> and proposed multiphase alloy bolt configurations were tested. Results indicated that joint skip and bolt bending were significantly reduced with the new multiphase alloy bolt design. This paper summarizes all the test results completed to date...|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{features}} four inline cylinders inclined {{at an angle}} of approximately 45 degrees (hence the name), and this is because Vauxhall had originally planned to develop a whole family of engines all built on the same production line. There was to be slant four and V8 versions in both petrol and diesel versions, designed {{under the guidance of}} Vauxhall's then chief engineer, John Alden. Although several diesel 4-cylinder and a V8 petrol engine prototypes were built only the 4-cylinder petrol made it to series production. There is a single overhead camshaft operating two valves per cylinder. An ingenious valve train design incorporating an inclined socket <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screw,</b> allowed valve clearances to be adjusted with a feeler gauge and an Allen key. The block and crossflow head are both of cast iron. The layout makes good use of the cylinder inclination to lower the overall height of the engine, which allowed for more aerodynamic designs of cars to be achieved by lowering the bonnet line. It also means most of the engine is very easy to access for maintenance, {{with the exception of the}} exhaust manifold and spark plugs, which are [...] "underneath" [...] the slanted cylinders.|$|R
5000|$|Male bit {{drivers are}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{referred to as}} [...] "sockets", but are in fact the opposite of a socket, in that bit drivers fit into a socket <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> or pipe plug, rather than fit over a male drive head on a nut or bolt as a socket does. A socket is a [...] "female" [...] recess or opening which receives another object, together as a fitting connection. A socket is not a protruding [...] "male" [...] connection. Common male bit drivers of this type include Allen hex wrenches (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), Torx (T-3 thru T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized screw heads that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various screw head types and a can be attached to a socket wrench. Conversely, for low torque situations, a [...] "socket spinner" [...] screwdriver handle with a socket wrench type fitting on one end can be attached to {{many different types of}} sockets, bit drivers and extensions.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, fatigue {{strength}} of the engine damper <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> bolt is determined. Engine damper <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> is critical fastener. Critical fastener is a term used to describe a <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> that, upon failure, causes immediate engine shutdown or possible harm to person. So, determination of {{fatigue strength}} is important. S-N method is used for <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> fatigue strength determination by testing number of samples at different alternating load keeping mean load constant. Alternating load is increased until <b>cap</b> <b>screws</b> begin to fail. But for measurement of axial load in fasteners, ultrasonic bolt gauging method is used. It has been observed that fatigue failure takes place on the thread of <b>cap</b> <b>screw</b> bolt due to high stress concentration on the thread...|$|R

40|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine {{closures}} provide {{many benefits}} in maintenance of wine quality over time, however acceptance of their use by purchasers has varied. This work first investigates how factors like age, gender, income and education affect {{the decision to}} purchase <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wines {{and to what extent}} these factors impact consumer decisions to bring <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine to various social settings. The results of a questionnaire pooling attitudes and behaviors of wine purchasers (n= 319) indicate that factors such as age, wine knowledge, income and gender influence a consumer’s decision to purchase <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wine. Education and income positively impact the acceptance of <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wines and the likelihood of purchasing them. Age has a negative effect on acceptance of <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> wines in social situations.

50|$|Compared to cork, <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> {{reduce the}} wine faults of {{oxidation}} and of cork taint, {{although it is}} possible to find TCA contamination in a <b>screw</b> <b>cap</b> bottle. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> are generally perceived as easier to open. <b>Screw</b> <b>caps</b> have a much lower failure rate than cork, and in theory will allow a wine to reach the customer in perfect condition, with a minimum of bottle variation. However, cork has a centuries-old tradition behind it, and there are also concerns about the impact of <b>screw</b> <b>caps</b> on the aging of those few wines that require decades to be at their best. Some argue that the slow ingress of oxygen plays a vital role in aging a wine, while others argue that this amount is almost zero in a sound cork and that any admitted oxygen is harmful.|$|R

40|$|The chronological {{formation}} {{and development of}} three rat spermatozoon head components - the nucleus, acrosomic system and perinuclear theca - were investigated by electron microscopy during spermiogenesis and transit through the epididymis. Chromatin condensation involves an intermediate step of coarse chromatin filament formation. Coarse filaments aggregate into coarse chromatin clumps which, in turn, fuse into a dense homogeneous mass late in spermiogenesis. The completely formed acrosomic system is composed of the acrosome and <b>head</b> <b>cap,</b> both enclosed in a continuous unit membrane, and a separated portion of the <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> called the ventral flap running on the antero-ventral part of the head. During spermiogenesis, the acrosome and <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> are formed as distinct morphological entities, and the ventral flap ls split off from the <b>head</b> <b>cap</b> during step 14 of spermiogenesis. Perinuclear material forms adjacent to the nucleus in three areas which eventually become connected. The material of this continuous layer condenses during the last steps 18 and 19 of spermiogenesis to form the perinuclear theca, a continuous layer over the nucleus except around the attachment site of the flagellum...|$|R
