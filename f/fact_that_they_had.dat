5|$|The Germans {{had very}} {{little in the way of}} heavy weapons, as they had {{discarded}} most of their artillery and machine guns due to lack of ammunition. Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns up close to the rifle pits, using them only at close range to ensure his ammunition would not be wasted. The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and finding themselves hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> enough military supplies to continue the action.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{significant}} {{problems with the}} casemate guns early on, however. They were equipped with hinged plates that were designed to close off the casemate opening in heavy seas. The plates were easily washed away, though, and without them, water easily entered the ship and caused significant flooding. This problem was compounded by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been mounted too low in the hull, which subjected them to heavier pounding from rough seas. The problem was eventually corrected {{by the addition of}} dwarf bulkheads in the gun houses and rubber seals to the hinged plates.|$|E
5|$|Brummer {{was ready}} for service with the fleet by May 1916, though she did not steam {{with the rest of}} the High Seas Fleet for the Battle of Jutland at the end of the month. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been built as minelaying cruisers, Brummer and Bremse were never used in this capacity. In the autumn of 1917, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the chief of the Admiralstab, decided to {{supplement}} the U-boat campaign with surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia. In addition to damaging British shipping, Scheer sought to divert escorts from the Atlantic theater, where his U-boats were concentrated. Brummer, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Leonhardi, and Bremse, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Westerkamp, were selected for the first such operation. Their high speed and large radius of action, coupled with their resemblance to British light cruisers, made them suited to the task. In preparation for the raid, their crews painted the ships dark gray to further camouflage them as British vessels.|$|E

5|$|Jane's legal husband, who {{was still}} living in London, {{attempted}} to blackmail her in 1838 by publishing {{the details of her}} marital status in Barnard Gregory's The Satirist. Johnson published the notice after learning that she was living with a Mr. Hogg. He was mistaken as to the identity of her lover, however, and attempted to blackmail James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly. After James Hogg prepared to bring a libel suit, Johnson quickly disappeared. Although one journalist initially planned to publish the correct identities of the parties involved, at Mary Shelley's request Leigh Hunt convinced him not to publish the story. Johnson died in Hammersmith in 1840, ensuring an end to the matter. Though they were now free to marry, Jane and Thomas declined to marry in order not {{to draw attention to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been unmarried for so long.|$|E
5|$|On 20–22 September, the VRS 5th Kozara and 6th Sanska brigades {{managed to}} push OG Centre back {{approximately}} , while parts of OG North had {{to withdraw from}} some areas they had captured. OG North was able to continue its advance near Novi Grad and towards Ljubija against strong resistance. On 22 September, Colonel General Ratko Mladić cut short his medical treatment in Belgrade to return to Banja Luka and control the VRS more directly. The meeting between the top VRS commanders and Mladić produced a request for general mobilisation, establishment of corps-level drumhead court-martials, and a request for the SDG to leave the area—despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been invited by the Republika Srpska Ministry of the Interior and had been granted authority by Radovan Karadžić, the president of Republika Srpska. Finally, a VRS counteroffensive was ordered to regain the lost territory.|$|E
5|$|The column left Bulawayo heading north, and, in {{an attempt}} to {{expedite}} its progress, reorganised itself into a more compact 290-man force at Shiloh. Lobengula, meanwhile, rode north towards the Shangani in his wagon, which left obvious tracks in its wake. Following the wagon tracks, Forbes's men were soon hot on the trail, routinely finding recently abandoned Matabele camps, provisions and stragglers. Heavy rain slowed both the king and his pursuers, and led Forbes to split his force again; moving on with a flying column of 160 men, he sent the rest back with the wagons. He pushed on, and on 3 December 1893 reached the southern bank of the Shangani, from where he could clearly see Matabele hastily driving cattle behind an impi (regiment) of warriors. The presence of smouldering fires beside the native column betrayed the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> just crossed. Wishing to know whether the king had crossed here or at another point on the river, Forbes sent Major Allan Wilson across to scout ahead with 12 men and eight officers, and told him to return by nightfall.|$|E

5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, a Sunday, {{at around}} 18:00, a general disturbance {{was reported in}} the town bazaar and columns of smoke were seen, rising from burning buildings. The 60th Rifles were waiting outside the local church, ready to attend a service, which had been delayed by half an hour on account of unusually warm weather; the sound of gunfire from the town alerted them to trouble. They headed to their own barracks, armed themselves, and were on their parade square awaiting orders when they were attacked by mounted troopers from the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry. Upon finding the 60th Rifles unexpectedly armed and waiting for them, the troopers rode away, headed directly to the jail and released their comrades {{with the help of a}} local blacksmith. At the same time, soldiers from the 11th and 20th Regiments of Bengal Native Infantry were mutinying, killing some of their officers and some civilians (while helping some of their officers and officers' families to escape), and burning a number of buildings within the town. One company of the 60th Rifles was ordered to guard the treasury, a second company was ordered to guard their barracks, and the remainder of the 60th Rifles, joined by the 6th Dragoon Guards, headed to the barracks of the Native Infantry regiments. When they arrived, they found the buildings ablaze and the area deserted. Hewitt, concerned about the possibility of attack, withdrew the troops back toward their barracks and encamped them nearby. Throughout the mutiny and subsequent rioting, one troop consisting of between 80 and 90 members of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry remained loyal to their officers. The mutinying soldiers from the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry, having released their comrades from the jail, returned to Meerut and joined in with the rioting along with members of the local civilian population, and then the mutineers from all three regiments left, heading to Delhi, although the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> left Meerut was not discovered by the military authorities until the following morning and they did not know the direction in which the mutineers had departed.|$|E
