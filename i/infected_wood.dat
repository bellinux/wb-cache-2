40|$|International audienceChemical {{composition}} of crude extracts from <b>infected</b> <b>woods</b> of Aquilaria malaccensis {{were compared to}} that of healthy wood and commercial agarwood. <b>Infected</b> <b>woods</b> were collected six months after drilling of wild mature trees or after fungal inoculation into the stem of 4 -year-old trees. Agarwood substances were extracted in methanol and were subjected to GC-MS analyses. The major compounds were chromone derivative, aromatic compounds, sesquiterpenes, monoterpenes, sterols and fatty acid methyl ester. Aromatic compounds constituted of aldehyde, phenol, ether and ketone groups. In the agarwood extract of the juvenile fungal-elicited tree but not in the healthy wood, some major compounds found were 2 -(2 -phenylethyl) chromone derivative, 4 -phenyl- 2 -butanone, (1 S, 4 S, 7 R) - 1, 4 -dimethyl- 7 -(prop- 1 -en- 2 -yl) - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 -octahydroazulene [guaiene], 1, 1, 4, 7 -tetramethyl- 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7 a, 7 b-octahydro- 1 aH-cyclopropa[h]azulen- 4 a-ol [palustrol], and 4 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) butan- 2 -one [anisylacetone]. These were also found from agarwood of different grades and agarwood collected from the wild mature tree, in addition to agarospirol, alloaromadendre oxide (2), alpha-elemol, gamma-eudesmol, and guaiol. This work demonstrated that in young A. malaccensis trees, fungi may be associated to the formation of important agarwood compounds and can be detected as early as six months after inoculation...|$|R

It occurs alongside the Cardinal woodpecker which to some extent exploits thinner branches.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these symptoms, signs of the infectious organism are very evident in the host. Upon removal of the bark, white mycelial mats are visible along with rhizomorphs, a distinctive reproductive structure. Clusters of mushrooms will also form {{at the base of}} the infected tree, indicating an infection. Also, zone lines of melanized fungal cells may be visible within <b>infected</b> <b>wood.</b>|$|E
50|$|Eru {{has been}} found to be {{negatively}} impacted if grown on or next to termite <b>infected</b> <b>wood</b> or trees. However, the productivity of the vine appears to be resistant to a significant proportion of diseases. The vine is largely understudied and more research is needed to verify plant susceptibility and resilience to viruses, diseases, and fungi. Eru depletion is largely associated with tree felling and overexploitative forestry practices. Overexploitation is partly caused by unsustainable forest clearing practices throughout regions in Africa.|$|E

50|$|A living tree can {{be killed}} by the feeding {{activity}} of adults and larvae, which damages the phloem {{in such a way}} that the tree is girdled. The beetles also introduce several species of fungi which invade and <b>infect</b> the <b>wood,</b> blocking the xylem. The first sign of an Ips infestation in a tree may be the discoloration of the needles that occurs when fungi block the xylem and prevent water transport to the foliage. Several species of blue stain fungus can be vectored by the beetles, including those of the genera Ophiostoma and Ceratocystis.|$|R
50|$|The Winkler Vine {{was trained}} on a 60x60ft steel arbour, {{covering}} 1/12 of an acre and {{was capable of}} producing over a tonne of fruit.

50|$|After {{starting}} {{as just a}} crust on the wood, the fruiting structure develops undulating intergrowing brackets up {{to about}} 3 cm broad, which have a tough rubbery texture. The edges and fertile lower surfaces show a fairly vivid violet colour while the fungus is growing, and the upper surfaces have a grey aspect (sometimes with zonation) and are covered with whitish hairs. After {{a week or two}} the fructification dries out, becomes brittle, and turns a drab brown or beige. <b>Infected</b> <b>wood</b> can be recognized because it is stained a darker tint.|$|E
50|$|The fungus {{causes a}} brown heart rot, {{resulting}} in wood {{that is a}} light brown to red-brown color, and dry, with a stringy texture.

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, only 300 wood bison {{remained}} worldwide, {{almost exclusively in}} Wood Buffalo National Park. During the 1920s, 6000-7000 plains bison were also relocated to Wood Buffalo National Park. These bison were not only infected with brucellosis and tuberculosis, which <b>infected</b> the <b>wood</b> bison herd, but the wood and plains subspecies also interbred, and thus {{it was thought that}} wood bison were completely extinct by the 1940s. In 1957, however, a disease-free, wood bison herd of 200 was discovered near Nyarling river in Wood Buffalo National Park. In 1965, 23 of these bison were relocated to the south side of Elk Island National Park and remain there today as the most genetically pure wood bison remaining. In 2007, the wood bison population in Elk Island National Park was estimated at 315.|$|R
50|$|The balm (resin) {{produced}} and accumulated from the wood {{is used as}} a valuable Chinese medicine called “Chen Xiang” (沉香). According to Chinese medicinal literature, the resin can be extracted in large quantities by natural fungal infection or by external wounding (up to 5 cm into the bark). Sustainable harvesting of the resin of one tree can be induced by opening a wound 3 to 4 cm into the bark, and with the resin collected a few years later after accumulation. Or a small quantity of resin can be extracted from wood blocks by heating or burning, so that the resin liquefies and seeps from the wood blocks. Sections of trees trunks or branches that contain patches of fragrant, resinous wood enter into the trade under the name “agarwood”. The resin is probably produced by the plant as a reaction against fungal infection or external wounding. Resin impregnated fragrant wood is usually found in trees older than 20 years. Although not all trees are infected, with increasing harvest pressure, harvesters in some regions often fell trees indiscriminately in search of <b>infected</b> <b>wood.</b> Good quality “Chen Xiang”, derived mostly from a related species Aquilaria malaccensis, was formerly imported from the Asian tropics into China but the supply of such quality products is now depleted. The resin produced by Aquilaria sinensis {{has been used as a}} substitute to the former and thus also under threats.|$|E

5000|$|In {{keeping with}} the theory of abiogenesis, in which living things can develop from non-living things, {{scientists}} traditionally believed that tree decay led to fungal growth. [...] With the advent of germ theory, however, German forester Robert Hartig in the early 20th century theorized the opposite was the case, and developed a new model for tree decay: when trees are wounded, fungi infect the wounds, {{and the result is}} decayed wood. Over time, the research of Shigo and others helped to expand this theory, leading to the modern concept of tree decay: when trees are wounded, many organisms, not just fungi, <b>infect</b> the <b>wood</b> at different times and in different ways; trees respond to these infections with both chemical and physical changes; discolored and decayed wood results, but is limited by compartmentalization.|$|R

Burning of pistachio wood, naturally infected with Xtp, was conducted twice under field conditions. Viable Xtp was detected in some non-burned wood, but not in charcoal, ash or partially burned wood. Controlled laboratory experiments were conducted with pure cultures of Xtp and naturally and artificially infected pistachio wood. In liquid culture, 65 °C was lethal to Xtp, whereas survival at 60 °C or less varied with culture medium and duration of exposure.
