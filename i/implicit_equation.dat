25|$|An {{algebraic}} {{curve in}} the Euclidean plane is {{the set of the}} points whose coordinates are the solutions of a bivariate polynomial equation p(x, y) = 0. This equation is often called the <b>implicit</b> <b>equation</b> of the curve, in contrast to the curves that are the graph of a function defining explicitly y as a function of x.|$|E
25|$|With a curve {{given by}} such an <b>implicit</b> <b>equation,</b> the first {{problems}} are {{to determine the}} shape of the curve and to draw it. These problems are not as easy to solve {{as in the case of}} the graph of a function, for which y may easily be computed for various values of x. The fact that the defining equation is a polynomial implies that the curve has some structural properties that may help in solving these problems.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} {{a new type of}} language <b>equation,</b> namely <b>implicit</b> <b>equations,</b> and derive a number of properties which clearly demonstrate that the behavior of <b>implicit</b> <b>equations</b> differs substantially from that of conventional or explicit ones. Explicit language equations express each variable as a regular expression in terms of their variables and constant languages; <b>implicit</b> language <b>equations</b> express constant languages as regular expressions in terms of their variables and constant languages. An algorithm is given for determining a solution of a given system of <b>implicit</b> language <b>equations,</b> if one exists, provided all constant languages are regular and the operations permitted in the regular expressions are unrestricted union and concatenation from the left by a constant. A characterization of the uniqueness of a solution of such a system and a method for determining all solutions are also provided...|$|R
40|$|Non linear <b>implicit</b> <b>equations</b> are {{frequently}} minimized in computer vision either to estimate a parameter from an initial guess or to rene a previous linear estimation. In such configurations, the local minimum {{of interest and}} the initial guess are rather close. We thus present a specific method for the minimization of such non linear <b>implicit</b> <b>equations,</b> based on a complete specification of the parameters and on a randomized algorithm. As a direct application, we consider the visual estimation of the localization of a known planar pattern. Experimental results are presented and a comparison between standard minimization techniques is performed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} how to extend Ctadel, a Problem Solving Environment, {{in order to}} generate code for a turbulence scheme, in our case, within a numerical weather prediction model (NWP). Common for these schemes {{is the presence of}} <b>implicit</b> <b>equations.</b> We describe how to generate efficient codes for a particular class of <b>implicit</b> differential <b>equations,</b> that is encountered in the turbulence scheme of the Hirlam NWP model. This extension to Ctadel enables the code generation for a particular solution method for these <b>implicit</b> <b>equations.</b> This solution method is also used in the original hand-written (reference) code. We address problems like how to recognize the type of equations and how to generate efficient code for a prescribed solution method. Finally, we compare the generated code for the turbulence scheme with the hand-written reference code...|$|R

40|$|Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) {{improves}} the computational {{efficiency of the}} Metropo-lis algorithm by reducing its random walk behavior. Riemannian Manifold HMC (RMHMC) further improves HMC’s performance by exploiting the geometric properties of the parameter space. However, the geometric integrator used for RMHMC involves <b>implicit</b> <b>equations</b> that require costly numerical analysis (e. g., fixed-point iteration). In some cases, the computa-tional overhead for solving <b>implicit</b> <b>equations</b> undermines RMHMC’s benefits. To avoid this problem, we propose an explicit geometric integrator that replaces the momentum variable in RMHMC by velocity. We show that the resulting transformation is equivalent to transform-ing Riemannian Hamilton dynamics to Lagrangian dynamics. Experimental results show that our method improves RMHMC’s overall computational efficiency. All computer programs and data sets are available onlin...|$|R

The geometry of the domain is represented using <b>implicit</b> <b>equations,</b> which can be generated from traditional solid models. Solution structures are constructed using <b>implicit</b> <b>equations</b> such that the essential boundary conditions are satisfied exactly. This approach is used to solve boundary value problems arising in thermal and structural analysis. Convergence analysis is performed for several numerical examples and the results are compared with analytical and {{finite element analysis}} solutions to show that the method gives solutions that are similar to the finite element method in quality but is often less computationally expensive. Furthermore, by eliminating the need for mesh generation, better integration can be achieved between solid modeling and analysis stages of the design process...|$|R
