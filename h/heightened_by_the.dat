5|$|During {{the siege}} of the city by the Fourth Crusade, the sea walls {{nonetheless}} {{proved to be a}} weak point in the city's defences, as the Venetians managed to storm them. Following this experience, Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) took particular care to heighten and strengthen the seaward walls immediately after the Byzantine recapture of the city in 1261, since a Latin attempt to recover the city was regarded as imminent. Furthermore, the installation of the Genoese at Galata across the Golden Horn, agreed upon in the Treaty of Nymphaeum, posed a further potential threat to the city. Time being short, as a Latin attempt to recover the city was expected, the sea walls were <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> addition of two-meter high wooden and hide-covered screens. Ten years later, facing the threat of an invasion by Charles d'Anjou, a second line of walls was built behind the original maritime walls, although no trace of them survives today.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated by the {{mobility}} of the Ottoman batteries, which evaded the Allied bombardments and threatened the minesweepers sent to clear the Straits, Churchill began pressuring the naval commander, Admiral Sackville Carden, to increase the fleet's efforts. Carden drew up fresh plans and on 4 March sent a cable to Churchill, stating that the fleet could expect to arrive in Constantinople within 14 days. A sense of impending victory was <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> interception of a German wireless message that revealed the Ottoman Dardanelles forts were running out of ammunition. When the message was relayed to Carden, it was agreed a main attack would be launched on or around 17 March. It transpired that Carden, suffering from stress, {{was placed on the}} sick list by the medical officer and command was taken over by Admiral John de Robeck.|$|E

5|$|In essence, the lbw law {{remained}} the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs; their use for any other purposes was considered unsporting, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence: they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further; if the delivery {{was not an easy}} one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, over a six-day period, Heathrow was {{targeted}} three times (8, 10, and 13 March) by the IRA, which fired 12 mortars. Heathrow was a symbolic target {{due to its}} importance to the UK economy, and much disruption was caused when areas of the airport were closed over the period.

25|$|In June 2017, Amazon {{announced}} that it would acquire Whole Foods, a high-end supermarket chain with over 400 stores, for $13.4 billion. The acquisition was seen by media experts as a move to strengthen its physical holdings and challenge Walmart's supremacy as a brick and mortar retailer. This sentiment was <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the announcement coincided with Walmart's purchase of men's apparel company Bonobos. On August 23, 2017, Whole Foods shareholders, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, approved the deal.|$|E

25|$|The National Association of Railroad Passengers (NARP) {{was formed}} in 1967 to lobby for the {{continuation}} of passenger trains. Its lobbying efforts were hampered somewhat by Democratic opposition to any sort of rail subsidies to the privately owned railroads, and Republican opposition to nationalization of the railroad industry. The proponents were aided {{by the fact that}} few in the federal government wanted to be held responsible for the seemingly inevitable extinction of the passenger train, which most regarded as tantamount to political suicide. The urgent need to solve the passenger train disaster was <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> bankruptcy filing of the Penn Central, the dominant railroad in the Northeast U.S., on June 21, 1970.|$|E
25|$|Much of the Ring, {{especially}} from Siegfried act 3 onwards, cannot {{be said to}} be in traditional, clearly defined keys for long stretches, but rather in 'key regions', each of which flows smoothly into the following. This fluidity avoided the musical equivalent of clearly defined musical paragraphs, and assisted Wagner in building the work's huge structures. Tonal indeterminacy was <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> increased freedom with which he used dissonance and chromaticism. Chromatically altered chords are used very liberally in the Ring, and this feature, which is also prominent in Tristan und Isolde, is often cited as a milestone on the way to Arnold Schoenberg's revolutionary break with the traditional concept of key and his dissolution of consonance as the basis of an organising principle in music.|$|E
25|$|Bucharest {{was shaken}} {{by a series}} of crimes {{committed}} {{in the latter half of}} 1970 and the first months of 1971. An unknown individual would use a hammer, a small ax, an iron bar or a knife to attack restaurant waitresses who were alone and returning from work. He struck after midnight during unusual weather conditions such as snowstorms, driving rain, high winds, freezing cold or fog. Many women would not go outside after 9:00 pm except in large groups or with men. Their terror was <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> police's reluctance to release details, leading to wildly exaggerated rumors. After a few crimes, the police realized that they were dealing with a serial killer; a yearlong investigation, with the help of victims who had survived, led to Rîmaru's arrest on May 27, 1971.|$|E

25|$|In 524/525 Kavadh {{proposed}} to Justin I to adopt his son, Khosrau. The proposal was initially greeted with enthusiasm by the Roman emperor and his nephew, Justinian, but Justin's quaestor, Proculus, opposed the move. Despite the final {{breakdown of the}} negotiations, {{it was not until}} 530 that full-scale warfare on the main eastern frontier broke out. In the intervening years, the two sides preferred to wage war by proxy, through Arab allies in the south and Huns in the north. Tensions between the two powers were further <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> defection of the Iberian king Gourgen to the Romans: in 524/525 the Iberians rose in revolt against Persia, following the example of the neighboring Christian kingdom of Lazica, and the Romans recruited Huns from the north of the Caucasus to assist them.|$|E
25|$|The {{music by}} Torrejón conserves {{much of the}} {{character}} and the idiosyncrasies contained in the comedies of Calderón as previously set by Juan Hidalgo. It is speculated that Torrejón {{may have been one}} of Hidalgo's pupils and that his work was possibly a source of inspiration for Torrejón in the composition of his own version. The score makes use of a variety of Spanish song types and Latin American musical influences, incorporating Latin American melodies and rhythms into the overall European dramatic and harmonic structure. The erotic nature of the text is <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of dance rhythms, musical repetitions, and sensual lyrical lines. The ornamental writing is also used deftly to emphasize the drama of the text. The exact instrumentation has not been found in Torrejón y Velasco's surviving original scores. However, the scores of other late seventeenth century musical plays in Spain suggest that the instruments would include harps, guitars, viols, violins, clarino and regular trumpets, drums, and castanets.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression in the United States {{hurt the}} Polish American {{communities}} across the country as heavy industry and mining sharply cut employment. During the prosperous 1920s, the predominantly Polish Hamtramck neighborhood suffered from an economic slowdown in the manufacturing sector of Detroit. The Hamtramck neighborhood was in disrepair, with poor public sanitation, high poverty, rampant tuberculosis, and overcrowding, and {{at the height of the}} Depression in 1932, nearly 50% of all Polish Americans were unemployed. Those who continued to work in the nearby Dodge main plant, where a majority of workers were Polish, faced intolerable conditions, poor wages, and were demanded to speed up production beyond reasonable levels. As the industrial trades Polish Americans worked in became less financially stable, an influx of Blacks and poor southern Whites into Detroit and Hamtramck exacerbated the job market and competed directly with Poles for low-paying jobs. Corporations benefited from the interracial strife and routinely hired Blacks as strikebreakers against the predominantly Polish-American trade unions. The Ford Motor Company used Black strikebreakers in 1939 and 1940 to counter strikes by the United Auto Workers, which had a predominantly Polish-American membership. The mainly Polish UAW membership and pro-Ford Black loyalists fought at the gates of the plant, often in violent clashes. Tensions with blacks in Detroit was <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> construction of a federally funded housing project, the Sojourner Truth houses, near the Polish community in 1942. Polish Americans lobbied against the houses, but their political sway was ineffective. Racial tensions finally exploded in the race riot of 1943.|$|E

5000|$|The {{strength}} of the paradox can be <b>heightened</b> <b>by</b> considering <b>the</b> two hemispheres to be of different diameters; with the outer shell a good distance farther away.
