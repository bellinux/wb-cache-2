40|$|Queensland {{has over}} 42, 000 {{hectares}} of hardwood plantations, with 13, 700 hectares currently managed for sawn timber and high-value products. Previously, a major impediment to {{expansion of the}} <b>hardwood</b> <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> and high-value products industry in Queensland was that improved varieties of the key subtropical and tropical species were not available for plantation establishment. Trees from earlier projects, such as Hardwoods Queensland and the Private Plantations Initiative, have now reached an age where selection for growth, form and wood properties is possible. The current project used non-destructive and destructive wood evaluation techniques to characterise the timber quality of 443 subtropical and tropical Corymbia and Eucalyptus trees in these plantings, allowing selection of trees with the best growth, form and wood properties under Queensland conditions. Ecological assessments were also undertaken in the Corymbia plantings to identify germplasm that posed minimal risk of gene flow into native forests. Elite varieties are being fast tracked for deployment in Queensland using economical systems for germplasm capture and nursery production. The project identified and captured 108 new Corymbia and Eucalyptus varieties that can be grown with confidence in Queensland over a shorter rotation length and which produce well-characterised high-quality hardwood timber...|$|E
40|$|Spotted gum (Corymbia citriodora {{subspecies}} Variegata) is {{a popular}} tree species for <b>hardwood</b> <b>saw</b> <b>timber</b> plantations in Southeast Queensland (SEQ), Australia. In {{many parts of the}} world, logs up to 10 cm top diameter are considered to be merchantable logs and acceptable at sawmills. However, due to the higher handling costs of smaller size logs, sawmills in SEQ are only buying logs with a top diameter of 25 cm and larger. This necessitates the determination of the volume of logs with top diameters between 10 cm and 25 cm. This paper compares the taper rates of different sizes of spotted gum logs and estimates the stem volume of spotted gum logs between 10 and 24. 94 cm diameter. Analysis showed that there is a statistically significant difference between the mean taper rates of bottom (30. 5 - 64. 2 cm diameter) and top parts of stems (10 - 24. 94 cm diameter) at harvesting age. Using only the average taper rate of large diameter logs would underestimate the log volume of smaller diameter logs. The average length of spotted gum logs between 10 and 24. 94 cm was found to be 19. 27 m. Therefore, by the sawmill declining to use 10 to 24. 94 cm diameter logs, approximately 0. 55 m 3 of log volume per tree at harvesting age would be lost...|$|R

However, there are few data quantifying the volume and value of residual timber in such areas. We inventoried merchantable timber in nine RZs of three widths in sapling-class East Texas pine plantations. Present, discounted, and projected volumes and values of residual timber were determined. Average per-acre volumes of narrow, medium, and wide RZs were 337, 1438, and 2542 board feet (Doyle log rule) and 4. 6, 8. 2, and 7. 2 cords, respectively. At US $ 154. 00 and US $ 57. 00 per thousand board feet for pine and <b>hardwood</b> <b>saw</b> <b>timber,</b> respectively, and US $ 15. 00 and US $ 5. 00 per cord for pine and hardwood pulpwood, respectively, average present per-acre values were US $ 46. 41, US $ 209. 93 and US $ 352. 75 for narrow, medium, and wide RZs.

The demond function for investment in <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> industry are evaluated as basis for impact estimation, using time series analysis, to estimate demand function for net investment (in(t)) in <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> industry. A distributed lag model was used. The result of the distributed lag model shows that the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> export tax policy caused this industry adjust their investment in 1. 3 years. The increase of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> export tax rate to 78. 3 % at the and of 1989 had caused a decrease demand for net investment of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> industry about Rp 222. 970 billion (constant price 1983) and Rp 132, 798 billion (constant price 1983) in 1990 and 1991, or about 50 % respectively.

30|$|A {{shift to}} rail {{transport}} {{does not seem}} to be an option for <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> The latest figures show that only 0.3  % of the Swedish forest industry exports <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> by rail [41]. The reason for this, according to Johan at Holmen Timber, is that transport costs account for a larger share of the value of goods for <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> than for pulp and paper. Railway transport implies huge costs associated with handling, making door-to-door transport by truck a more cost effective alternative. Long shipping distances are required to compensate for the extra handling costs.

The small sawmill was opened in 1941 {{at a time when the}} Second World War demanded increased production of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> in Queensland.

40|$|The main {{question}} asked {{of the work}} described in this thesis was howthe sawing of logs into <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> can be performed more efficientlywith respect to the choice of raw material, volume and value yield in thesawing and in the grading of the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> produced. The development of industrial computed tomography scanning providesinformation about the external and internal properties of a sawlogat production speed. This opens up new possibilities of controlling theflow of raw material early {{in the process and}} of optimizing the breakdownof each sawlog. Another use of industrial computed tomography scanningis for predicting the strength of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> better than is possible withcurrent visual and machine strength grading equipment. A more traditional way of increasing sawmill profitability is by increasingthe volume of <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> One way of doing this is by reducing thesaw blade thickness which results in less sawdust. With the use of thinnersaw blades however there is a risk that the saw blades become misalignedwhich in turn leads to saw mismatch, an unevenness seen on the surfaceof the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> In this work, attempts were made to automaticallymeasure and monitor saw mismatch in a sawmill during ongoing production. It is also possible for a sawmill to increase its profitability by measuresnot related to the sawing process. One such example is customer adaptationwhen delivering the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> Different customers use the sawntimber for different purposes and consequently have different requirements,which is why the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> produced is graded and sorted before it isdelivered to the customer. In this work, an alternative method for gradingsawn timber more efficiently using a multivariate method was developedand evaluated. The following results have been obtained:Log breakdowns of 716 Scots pine logs and 750 Norway spruce logsthat had been scanned using computed tomography were simulated andthe rotational position of each log was optimized. The results showedan average relative value increase of 16 % for appearance graded sawntimber compared to the conventional horns down position. When simulating log breakdowns of 677 Norway spruce logs with respect to visuallystrength graded <b>sawn</b> <b>timber,</b> an average relative value increase of 11 %was obtained. The effect that errors in knot detection algorithms had ona breakdown optimization was also analysed when optimizing breakdownof 57 Norway spruce sawlogs. The results showed that errors in the knotdiameter had the most severe impact on the average relative value increaseof a log rotation optimization, followed by errors in the dead knot border. The smallest effect was observed in the case of errors in rotational positionof the knots. Computed tomography scanning can also be used in a sawmill for log sorting in relation to different end-uses of the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> A simulationsoftware for cross-cutting optimization based on computed tomographydata was developed and it was shown that there was a reasonable correlationbetween these results and the results of an industrial system. Sincethe developed software can be combined with log breakdown simulationsbased on computed tomography data, it is evident that computed tomographycan be used to identify logs that would result in a poor volume yieldin the subsequent cross-cut optimization. Destructive bending strength tests were performed on 113 pieces of Norway spruce <b>sawn</b> <b>timber.</b> Multivariate models for predicting the bending strength of the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> were created using computed tomography data of the sawlogs from which the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> originated. The results showed that computed tomography scanning of logs produced prediction models of bending strength with a higher accuracy than discrete X-rayscanning. The main advantage was the detailed knot information {{that could be used in}} the prediction models. A method to measure saw mismatch automatically in a sawmill basedon laser triangulation was developed and the measurements were well correlatedwith manual measurements of saw mismatch. When laser triangulationwas used to measure saw mismatch in a sawmill, a distinguishabletrend of increasing magnitude and frequency of saw mismatch was observed. Finally, ways in which the <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> in a sawmill could be gradedand sorted more efficiently was investigated. It was found that by using agrading method based on multivariate techniques it is possible to increasethe proportion of higher <b>sawn</b> <b>timber</b> grades by up to 10 percentage points,which may increase sawmill profitability.
