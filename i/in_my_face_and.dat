500|$|Hill began {{recording}} The Miseducation in late 1997 at Chung King Studios in New York City, {{and completed}} it in June 1998 at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica. In an interview, Hill described {{the first day}} of recording, stating: [...] "The first day in the studio I ordered every instrument I ever fell in love with: harps, strings, timpani drums, organs, clarinets. It was my idea to record it so the human element stayed in. I didn't want it to be too technically perfect." [...] Initially, Jean did not support Hill recording a solo album, but eventually offered to help as a producer, which she did not accept. Aside from doing work at Chung King Studios, Hill also recorded at Perfect Pair Studios in New Jersey, as well as Sony Studios, with some songs having different elements recorded at different studios. The bulk of the album, however, was recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in Kingston, Jamaica, the studio built by reggae musician Bob Marley. Regarding this shift in environment, Hill stated: [...] "When I started recording in New York and New Jersey, lots of people were talking to me about going different routes. I could feel people up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> I was picking up on bad vibes. I wanted a place where there was good vibes, where I was among family, and it was Tuff Gong." [...] Many members of the Marley family were present in the studio during the recording sessions, among them Julian Marley, who added guitar elements to [...] "Forgive Them Father." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, Verdi still {{refused to}} compose the music, taking the {{manuscript}} {{back to the}} impresario the next day. But Merelli would accept no refusal and he immediately stuffed the papers back into Verdi's pocket and [...] "not only threw me out of his office, but slammed the door <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> locked himself in". Verdi claims that gradually {{he worked on the}} music: [...] "This verse today, tomorrow that, here a note, there a whole phrase, and little by little the opera was written" [...] so that by the autumn of 1841 it was complete. At the very least, both Verdi's and Lessona's versions end with a complete score.|$|E
2500|$|Snowden's first {{television}} interview aired January 26, 2014, on Germany's NDR. In April 2014, {{he appeared on}} video from an undisclosed location during President Putin's live annual Q exchange with the public. Snowden asked whether Russia intercepted, stored or analyzed individuals' communications. Putin replied, [...] "Russia uses surveillance techniques for spying on individuals only with the sanction of a court order. This is our law, and therefore there is no mass surveillance in our country." [...] Benjamin Wittes in The New Republic described the exchange as [...] "a highly-scripted propaganda stunt for Vladimir Putin". Snowden insisted his question was designed to hold the Russian president accountable. In an op-ed for The Guardian, Snowden said his question was intended [...] "to mirror the now infamous exchange in US Senate intelligence committee hearings between senator Ron Wyden {{and the director of}} national intelligence, James Clapper, about whether the NSA collected records on millions of Americans, and to invite either an important concession or a clear evasion." [...] Snowden called Putin's response [...] "evasive". A few days later, The Daily Beast reported that Snowden himself [...] "instantly regretted" [...] asking Putin the [...] "softball question", which was crafted with several of his key advisers, and that he was mortified by the reaction. Ben Wizner, one of Snowden's legal advisers, told the Beast that Snowden hadn't realized how much his appearance with Putin would be seen as a Kremlin propaganda victory. [...] "I know this is hard to believe," [...] Wizner acknowledged. [...] "I know if I was just watching from afar, I'd think, 'Wow, they forced him to do this.' But it's not true. He just fucking did it." [...] Asked six months later about the incident, Snowden conceded, [...] "Yeah, that was terrible! Oh, Jesus, that blew up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> ... <b>And</b> in the United States, what I did appearing at that Putin press conference was not worth the price." ...|$|E
6000|$|He looked <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> steadily, <b>and</b> then, {{instead of}} {{replying}} to my remark, he said slowly, [...] "Your name is Spottiswood, I believe?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Oh, that manner, I {{could see}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> visitor's <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> {{not a little}} else besides! [...] "She asks me every three minutes if I think you're coming in." ...|$|R
60|$|What I {{said was}} petulant and snappish enough, and Hunsden only replied by looking <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> laughing.|$|E
6000|$|We thundered on {{past the}} fishermen, and nothing had happened. Charley grinned at the {{disappointment}} he saw <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> then shouted: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll hold any man fifty pounds,' said Sir Mulberry, 'that Miss Nickleby can't look <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> {{tell me she}} wasn't {{thinking}} so.' ...|$|E
6000|$|There was an {{instantaneous}} convulsion <b>in</b> <b>my</b> cousin's <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> I distinctly {{heard him}} gnash his teeth at this reply; but, to my surprise, he resumed in tones of almost good-humour: ...|$|R

60|$|When the Blefuscudians saw {{the fleet}} moving in order, and me pulling at the end, {{they set up}} a scream of grief and despair that it is {{impossible}} to describe. When I had got out of danger I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck <b>in</b> <b>my</b> hands <b>and</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> rubbed on some of the same ointment that was given me at my arrival. I then took off my spectacles, and after waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen, I waded on to the royal port of Lilliput.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me as if he {{wondered}} who on earth I was, but I am sure he saw my soul <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> trusted me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I won't {{tell you}} a word until you drink," [...] {{repeated}} my friend, as he looked anxiously <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> held the flask to my lips.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tell her to {{take all}} there are and welcome. I shall be glad {{to get rid of}} them; always {{bouncing}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> getting in my dress,' laughed Mrs Jo.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1989, New York {{magazine}} {{published a}} feature story on Leighton, calling him the [...] "Man of a Thousand Faces." [...] He told the magazine that he avoided costume parties:"I {{never go to}} costume parties. That's a busman's holiday. Heaven for me is to lie in bed stark naked with no costume -- living <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>face</b> <b>and</b> not someone else's -- and luxuriate <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own skin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why in {{the name}} of common sense," [...] I cried, turning {{suddenly}} around <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chair <b>and</b> <b>facing</b> Walkirk, [...] "did you put into Miss Raynor's head all that stuff about typewriting? Did you do it simply because you liked to talk to her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Mr. Percival {{looked very}} white and upset, {{which was only}} natural; and when we had got my poor master to bed, I asked if I should not go and break the news to Mr. Murray, {{who had gone to}} {{business}} an hour ago. However, before Mr. Percival had time to give me an order the doctor came. I thought I had seen death plainly writ <b>in</b> <b>my</b> master's <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> when I showed the doctor out an hour later, {{and he told me that}} he would be back directly, I knew that the end was near.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, she did; {{she told}} me that she could read all sorts of things <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> offered, if I would give myself up to it, to make me more than human." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A big, tall {{fellow in}} a motor-car stopped {{me on the}} Mayfield road. He poked a pistol <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> took my purse and my watch. Sir Henry, that man was you." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{received}} me with disciplined amazement. Lady Osprey {{was interested}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> scrutinised the scar. Beatrice stood behind her solicitude. Our eyes met, and in hers I could see startled interrogations.|$|E
2500|$|The Las Vegas Review-Journal {{reported}} that tensions reached a [...] "critical level" [...] during the standoff, [...] "with rifles pointing toward each side." [...] Las Vegas station KLAS-TV also {{reported that}} guns were pointed at officers. Assistant Sheriff Lombardo recounted that [...] "they were <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> yelling profanities <b>and</b> pointing weapons," [...] and said, [...] "We were outgunned, outmanned, and there {{would not have been}} a good result from it." ...|$|R
60|$|He drew {{over the}} picture {{the sheet of}} thin paper on which I was {{accustomed}} to rest <b>my</b> hand <b>in</b> painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied. What he suddenly saw on this blank paper, {{it was impossible for}} me to tell; but something had caught his eye. He took it up with a snatch; he looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me, inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point <b>in</b> <b>my</b> shape, <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning. His lips parted, as if to speak: but he checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.|$|R
6000|$|Prometheus. Ay! in act now, in word now no more, [...] Earth is rocking in space.

[...] Such a curse on <b>my</b> head, <b>in</b> a manifest dread, [...] From the hand of your Zeus has been hurtled along. [...] O my mother's fair glory! O Æther, enringing [...] All eyes with the sweet common light of thy bringing! [...] Dost see how I suffer this wrong? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{took a step}} forward, {{but before}} I could gain the threshold, the door was slammed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> as I stood there, quivering with anger and disappointment, I heard the bolts being shot within.|$|E
60|$|We {{stood looking}} at one another {{on the edge of}} the marsh. In the clear morning {{sunlight}} I had no chance of escape or subterfuge. There was terror <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> she could see it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Elfride, we must bid {{good-bye to}} compliment,' said Knight: 'we must do without politeness now. Look <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> as {{you believe in}} God above, tell me truly one thing more. Were you away alone with him?' ...|$|E
60|$|Fortunately Pollie and I found {{ourselves}} {{in an empty}} carriage. The scream of the whistle, the grinding jar of the wheels, the oppressive odour of Mr Waggett's bouquet--I leaned back on her to recover my wits. But the cool air blowing <b>in</b> on <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and</b> a far-away sniff from a little glass bottle with which her mother had fortified her for the journey, quickly revived me, and I was free to enjoy the novelties of steam-travel. My eyes dizzied at the wide revolving scene that was now spread out beneath the feathery vapours. How strange it was to see the green country world--meadow and stream and wooded hill--thus wheel softly by. If Pollie and I could have shared it alone, {{it would have been}} among my pleasantest memories.|$|R
60|$|I {{sprang up}} and took her two little gloved hands <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own. As she came over the side her breath blew <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> sweet <b>and</b> warm, and all that vagueness and unrest seemed in a moment to have been {{shredded}} away from my soul. I felt as if that instant had taken me out from myself, and made me one of the race. It took but {{the time of the}} flicking of the horse's tail, and yet something had happened, a barrier had gone down somewhere, and I was leading a wider and a wiser life. I felt it all in a flush, but shy and backward as I was, I could do nothing but flatten out the sacking for her. Her eyes were after the coach which was rattling away to Berwick, and suddenly she shook her handkerchief in the air.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He is older, though; years older. But,' with a slap {{upon the}} table, 'it's the rum you see <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> - rum <b>and</b> sin. This man, perhaps, {{may have an}} easy {{conscience}} and a good digestion. Conscience! Hear me speak. You would think I was some good, old, decent Christian, would you not? But no, not I; I never canted. Voltaire might have canted if he'd stood <b>in</b> <b>my</b> shoes; but the brains' - with a rattling fillip on his bald head - 'the brains were clear and active, and I saw and made no deductions.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I didn't hope so. They all crowded up {{and leaned}} over the rails, nearly <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> kept still, {{watching}} with all their might. I could see them first-rate, but they couldn't see me. Then the captain sung out: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have told}} him as much, Squire," [...] Mr. Bastow said, in a {{depressed}} voice, [...] "and he has simply laughed <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> {{said that he was}} very comfortable where he was, and had no idea whatever of moving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Brooke, with {{a little}} hollow laugh. [...] "Not seriously, anyway. The fellow flung the door to <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> <b>and</b> the blow must have partly dazed me. That reminds me that I'm wasting time. Where is he now?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Meili {{took the}} stand during the trial and said afterwards: [...] "I'll tell you what—I didn't feel {{wonderful}} about the boys' defense attorneys, especially the one who cross-examined me. He was right <b>in</b> front of <b>my</b> <b>face</b> <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> essence, calling me a slut by asking questions like 'When's {{the last time you}} had sex with your boyfriend?'" [...] Wise's lawyer had also asked her whether she had been assaulted by men in her life, suggested that a man she knew may have attacked her, and implied her injuries were not as severe as they had been made out to be.|$|R
6000|$|August 21.--Wrought out my task, {{though much}} bothered {{with a cold}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head <b>and</b> <b>face,</b> how caught I know not.

All the [...] "calliachs"[323] from Huntly Burn are to be here, and Anne wishes we may have enough of dinner. Naboclish! it is hoped {{there will be a}} pièce de résistance.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's not of this world," [...] whispered my lord, [...] "neither him nor {{the black}} deil that serves him. I have struck my sword {{throughout}} his vitals," [...] he cried; [...] "I {{have felt the}} hilt dirl[12] on his breastbone, and the hot blood spirt <b>in</b> <b>my</b> very <b>face,</b> time <b>and</b> again, time and again!" [...] he repeated, with a gesture indescribable. [...] "But he was never dead for, that," [...] said he, and sighed aloud. [...] "Why should I think he was dead now? No, not till I see him rotting," [...] says he.|$|R
