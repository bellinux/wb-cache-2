40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} how the {{organization}} of creditors and debtors within an ad hoc sovereign debt framework affects the prospect of establishing a formal international mechanism for <b>debt</b> <b>disputes.</b> Since sovereign debtors are not bounded by the same constraints and guarantees as domestic actors, crisis-driven political battles and case-by-case compromises between creditor interests and indebted countries are the ideal building blocks for constructing {{a picture of the}} contemporary debt regime. A review of sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>disputes</b> between the 1970 s and the present day – corresponding to the North-South Dialogue, the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980 s, the International Monetary Fund’s Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism proposal, and Argentina’s 2014 default – indicates that a formal sovereign debt regime is unlikely to arise in the current bond-dominated atmosphere. In particular, the dominance of retail investors and other private bondholders, combined with stagnated or waning influence among public entities such as the IMF and the Paris Club, relegates the concept of a formal, permanent debt arbiter to an aspirational status...|$|R

40|$|In {{the absence}} of an {{international}} framework to regulate sovereign debt restructuring, investment arbitration has recently been seen as a potential forum for holdout creditors and vulture funds to seek to enforce sovereign debt instruments. However, the system of investment arbitration was not designed to enforce financial obligations, and even less to provide an avenue for the claims of speculative hedge funds and non-cooperative creditors. To date, however, most investment tribunals have found jurisdiction over sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>disputes.</b> Notwithstanding a few arbitration decisions, the consideration of human rights issues in international investment arbitration has so far remained rather {{on the periphery of the}} international investment law regime. Given the deep and broad human rights implications of debt crises, the report of the Independent Expert argues that it would be a dangerous development if bilateral investment treaties became a forum for solving sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>disputes.</b> While the international community is making great efforts to prevent or minimize holdout litigation, investment arbitration may open a new door for such creditors to deploy disruptive strategies. The current system of investment arbitration may therefore impair economic recovery and undermine State funding for public services and State institutions that give effect to economic, social, cultural rights and the protection of civil and political rights...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the legitimacy of}} investor-state arbitration under international investment agreements in sovereign debt restructuring. The paper presents mechanisms governing sovereign default generally, namely collective action clauses and informal negotiation in the London and Paris clubs and then discusses how sovereign debt restructuring is governed by IIAs, looking at how the clauses affect restructuring. Taking the conception of legitimacy in global governance by Buchanan and Keohane as a theoretical framework, the legitimacy of IIAs as a mechanism of governing sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>disputes</b> is questioned, looking at the aspects transparency, accountability, minimal moral acceptability, institutional integrity and comparative benefit. It is concluded that investor-state dispute settlement {{on the basis of}} IIAs lacks legitimacy to decide on sovereign debt restructuring...|$|R

25|$|In 1871, Virginia enacted {{legislation}} exchanging {{two-thirds of}} its outstanding bonds for new debt, and issuing certificates for the remaining one-third of the debt (which the state assumed would be paid by West Virginia) guaranteeing payment once the state's <b>debt</b> <b>dispute</b> with West Virginia was resolved. Virginia enacted legislation in 1879 reducing the interest rate on the outstanding one-third of the debt, {{but was unable to}} discharge the debt due to bondholder resistance. A second sale in 1882 also failed, and in 1892 Virginia issued new bonds to pay off the old one-third debt. Virginia established a commission in 1894 to negotiate with West Virginia over the debt, and in 1900 authorized the commission to accept the 1871 certificates from bondholders with the promise to pay once negotiations with West Virginia concluded.|$|R
50|$|The {{problem with}} the Third Circuit's holding is it treats {{liquidated}} and unliquidated debts alike. The whole theory behind requiring {{that the amount of}} a <b>debt</b> be <b>disputed</b> before the contested liability exception can be triggered is that only in the context of <b>disputed</b> <b>debts</b> is the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) unaware of the exact consideration initially exchanged in a transaction... The mere fact that a taxpayer challenges the enforceability of a debt in good faith does not necessarily mean he or she is shielded from discharge-of-indebtedness income upon resolution of the dispute. To implicate the contested liability doctrine, the original amount of the debt must be unliquidated. A total denial of liability is not a dispute touching upon the amount of the underlying debt.|$|R
40|$|From {{the first}} English {{settlement}} in colonial America {{to the beginning}} of the Revolution, the legal status of account books evolved. During this period, there was a scarcity of hard currency which made commercial transactions largely dependent upon a credit based, barter based economic system. Business transactions often were represented by book debt. As merchants brought legal actions over book <b>debt</b> <b>disputes,</b> American colonial courts and legislatures began to examine the English common law rules that placed several restrictions on the introduction of account books into evidence. Responding to economic and social necessity, colonial America developed a legal system that was more flexible and pragmatic than was the English system in regard to admitting account books into evidence. Thus, American colonial courts and legislatures met the commercial needs of the new world, and in so doing, provided the impetus for examining accounting standards, fiduciary duty and financial statements in today’s American legal system...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Disputed</b> <b>Debt</b> Doctrine (also {{known as}} the Contested Liability Doctrine), is yet another {{exception}} to including COD income in gross income. This doctrine {{can be found in}} a Third Circuit Court of Appeals case, Zarin v. Commissioner. [...] In order for this exception to apply, the amount of debt must actually be disputed. This can happen if the two parties actually have a good faith dispute over the amount owed. A written instrument containing the amount of debt will probably not satisfy this requirement. However, as the court decided in Zarin, the <b>Disputed</b> <b>Debt</b> Doctrine can also apply if the debt is not legally enforceable.|$|R
40|$|How taxpayers {{determine}} {{the amount of}} money on which they must pay taxes is an uneasy question because this amount, gross income, has never been conclusively defined. In the case of Preslar v. Commissioner, the Tenth Circuit examined this “disputed debt” exception in depth and came to a conclusion directly at odds with preexisting Third Circuit authority. This Note analyzes these opposing conclusions and ultimately suggests that this split arises because the two circuits interpret the underlying logic of debt discharge income differently. Part II more thoroughly introduces the concept of debt-discharge income and examines the <b>disputed</b> <b>debt</b> exception to the general rule. Part III examines the facts of the Preslar case and summarizes the Tenth Circuit’s reasoning. Part IV analyzes the court’s reasoning in the context of how the rationale for debt-discharge income should affect the <b>disputed</b> <b>debt</b> exception and critiques the Tenth Circuit’s application of the exception to the facts of the Preslar case. Finally, Part V concludes that the Preslar court correctly analyzed the concepts of debt-discharge income and the <b>disputed</b> <b>debt</b> exception but incorrectly applied those concepts to the facts of the Preslar case...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the ouster}} of Santa Anna in 1855, Mexican liberals came to power and began to {{implement}} their vision of Mexico through changes in law and ultimately the writing of a new constitution in 1857. The Constitution of 1857, established February 5, 1857, codified major changes, especially {{the separation of church}} and state. Mexican conservatives refused to swear fealty to the new constitution and set up a parallel government under general Félix Zuloaga and precipitated the War of the Reform (or Three Years' War). During this period, General Almonte was named special emissary to Spain to deal with outstanding bilateral issues between the two countries. While in Europe, he sought European powers' intervention in Mexico, concerned that the turmoil would be disastrous for the country. [...] "Unless we can persuade some European power to aid us in establishing some stable government, it is inevitable that the whole of Mexico must be swallowed up by the United States." [...] Almonte was a signatory of the Mon-Almonte Convention with Spain in 1859, which ended a period of suspension of diplomatic relations between Spain and Mexico over a <b>debt</b> <b>dispute.</b> The treaty saw Mexico pay debts to the Spaniards in exchange for economic aid against the Mexican Liberals.|$|R

This thesis {{guides the}} reader through {{contemporary}} {{problems of the}} law of sovereign debt and default. Adopting a horizontal approach to the field, the state in its double role of being a borrower from the market and a regulator of the market remains {{at the center of this}} inquiry. How do problems related to sovereign debt challenge state institutions, constitutional principles and even the very concept of statehood? What kind of tools does the state have at its disposal to address these problems? Can the state improve both, its own role as a borrower and the overall functioning of the sovereign debt market? These are the core questions discussed in this thesis on the basis of numerous examples. A detailed analysis of the practice of sovereign debt is followed by an account of case law primarily from municipal courts dealing with sovereign <b>debt</b> <b>disputes.</b> The IMF's 'bailouts' are reviewed in the light of the constitutions of the recipient states before in a last chapter, a full account of the Euro crisis and its particularities is given. All these examples show strengths and weaknesses of the state's role as borrower and regulator and ultimately indicate where and how the law of sovereign debt can be improved...|$|R
