40|$|With the {{emergence}} of craft brewing, the popularity of intense hoppy beer styles and breeding of new flavor hop varieties (with high oil contents and intense hop character) has increased. Hop citrus character is currently poorly characterized and therefore {{the objective of this}} study was to identify the odour-active molecules of citrusy hop oil fraction, in an attempt to investigate the relationship with the citrus character of some commercial hop varieties. We report in this work the results achieved in characterizing citrus hop character and the relevance in terms of production of commercial <b>hop</b> <b>product</b> fractions available to brewers. Hop essential oils were obtained from several varieties by steam distillation. The sensory profile of these hop oils was determined with the selected varieties divided in two groups; ‘citrusy’ and ‘not-citrusy’ hops. Volatile compounds were determined using reference compounds. Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) was used to fractionate hop essential oil, using a C 18 column stationary phase. Hop oils, suspended in an ethanol/water solution, were pipetted on the C 18 column and eluted to allow hop oil compounds to be adsorbed into the stationary phase. The adsorbed compounds were selectively desorbed and pipetted into a range of ethanol/MQ-water solutions and the effluents collected. The hop oil fractions were analysed by HS-SPME-GC-MS and Cluster analysis (Ward’s Method, Squared Euclidean) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were carried out. Sensory and chromatographic analysis of the varietal hop oils highlighted the citrusy hop character in specific fractions. The fraction 70 / 30 was selected for further analysis. Considerable differences in the qualitative and quantitative composition between the hop varieties were found by the GC-MS analysis of the 70 / 30 fraction. Analysis of citrus character in varietal hop essential oil was determined for several varieties with citrus intensity in the hop cones. These were compared and contrasted with non-citrus hop and citrus fruits. Cluster and PCA analysis highlighted the role of geraniol in citrus character. This project has identified initial practical benefits for the Hop Industry, namely the screening for citrus character of new hop varieties being bred, the ability to compound hop oil fractions to create citrus intense fractions, and to increase our understanding of hop citrus character and the synergistic effects of geraniol rich compounds in citrus intensity. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Hop, an {{essential}} ingredient in beer, contains different prenylflavonoids, among which 8 -prenylnaringenin (8 -PN) {{would be the}} most potent phytoestrogen currently known. Therefore, hop extracts are now marketed to relief menopausal complaints but efficiency varies greatly among individuals. As variability in biological activity was also noted for other phytoestrogens and related with variable intestinal bacterial metabolism, the goal of this work was to investigate whether intestinal bacteria also determine the final activity of hop phytoestrogens by combining batch incubations with SHIME, rat and human studies. Batch incubations learned that 8 -PN is stable towards microbial degradation but that isoxanthohumol (IX), another hop prenylflavonoid, can be activated into 8 -PN by bacterial O-demethylation. Although IX shows no estrogenic activity, it is present in <b>hop</b> <b>products</b> in 10 - to 30 -fold higher concentrations than 8 -PN, showing that intestinal IX activation may significantly increase 8 -PN exposure. SHIME experiments showed up to 80 % IX conversion, mainly in the distal colon. Experiments with 51 fecal samples indicated significant interindividual variations, with high, moderate and low 8 -PN producers. An experiment with germ-free and human microbiota associated rats and a human intervention trial confirmed the importance of variable intestinal IX activation and provided a definitive explanation for the variable biological activity of <b>hop</b> <b>products.</b> As the final activity of all phytoestrogens depends on variable intestinal metabolism, 100 fecal samples were incubated with precursors from all classes. This learned that the activation of different phytoestrogen classes occurs through separate pathways, with within-class correlations between different metabolites. Moreover, the production of specific metabolites was related to certain intestinal conditions. As variable IX activation implies variable 8 -PN exposure, technological applications were investigated to balance the 8 -PN exposure between individuals. To do this, an efficiently 8 -PN producing Eubacterium limosum strain was selected. Its application as probiotic to increase intestinal 8 -PN production was shown in vitro and in the rat model. In conclusion, it was demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the exposure to the potent phytoestrogen 8 -PN mainly depends on the product IX concentrations and the variable intestinal metabolic potential to activate IX. Moreover, strategies were developed to balance the 8 -PN exposure in all individuals...|$|R
40|$|Age-induced {{decomposition}} of iso-alpha-acids, the main bittering principles of beer, determines the consistence {{of the beer}} bitter taste. In this study, the profiles of iso-alpha-acids in selected high-quality top-fermented and lager beers were monitored by quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography at various time intervals during ageing. The degradation of the iso-alpha-acids {{as a function of}} time is represented by the ratio, in percentage, of the sum of the concentrations of trans-isocohumulone and trans-isohumulone to the sum of the concentrations of cis-isocohumulone and cis-isohumulone. This parameter is relevant with respect to the evaluation of bitterness deterioration in aged beers. Trans-iso-alpha-acids having a shelf half-life of less than one year proved to be significantly less stable than cis-iso-alpha-acids, but it appears feasible to counteract degradation if a suitable beer matrix is available. The fate of the trans-iso-alpha-acids in particular adversely affects beer bitterness consistency. In addition to using <b>hop</b> <b>products</b> containing low amounts of trans-iso-alpha-acids, brewers may profit of the remarkable stability of tetrahydroiso-alpha-acids, even on prolonged storage, for the production of consistently bitter beers. status: publishe...|$|R

These institutions, however, might in turn reshape the structure of the industry. The analysis indicates that the cartels in the hop industry were essentially 'children of opportunity' and their emergence was rarely correlated with an economic crisis. Even though the industry gave rise also to international collusive structures, the cartels in the hop industry were essentially unstable and weak and in most cases, the attempts to create them failed.

40|$|For many centuries, hops (Humulus lupulus L.) {{have been}} used as {{essential}} ingredient in beer, providing the typical bitterness and hoppy flavor. However, {{in the last few years}} the plant has gained increasing attention as a source of prenylflavonoids and in 1999, 8 -prenylnarigenin (8 -PN) was identified as the most potent phytoestrogen known so far. Hop extracts are therefore now marketed to reduce menopausal complaints. However, 8 -PN concentrations in hops are very low, and variable efficiency of these extracts was observed. Yet, hops also contain isoxanthohumol (IX) in much higher amounts (IX/ 8 -PN ratio in hop extracts is typically 10 - 20). This manuscript will review our recent findings that human intestinal microbiota may activate isoxanthohumol (IX). Depending on interindividual differences in the intestinal transformation potential, this conversion could easily increase the 8 -PN exposure tenfold. The variability in efficacy of hop extracts may therefore be explained by variable intestinal metabolism. Based on this scientific knowledge, an innovative strategy was developed to reduce this variability. First, Eubacterium limosum, capable of rapidly metabolizing all IX into 8 -PN, was isolated from the complex intestinal ecosystem. This bacterium was then used to develop a new generation of <b>hop</b> <b>products</b> with reduced variability in effect. This strategy involves the use of the bacterium as probiotic, in which the bacterium is administered in combination with the original hop extract.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{misunderstood}} and anticompetitive business behaviors in today’s economy is “product hopping,” which occurs when a brand-name pharmaceutical company switches from one version of a drug to another. These switches, benign in appearance but not necessarily in effect, can significantly decrease consumer welfare, impairing competition from generic drugs to an extent that greatly exceeds any gains from the “improved” branded product. The antitrust analysis of <b>product</b> <b>hopping</b> is nuanced. It implicates the intersection of antitrust law, patent law, the Hatch-Waxman Act, and state drug product selection laws. In fact, the behavior is even more complex because it occurs in uniquely complicated markets characterized by doctors who choose the product but don’t pay for it, and consumers who buy the product but don’t choose it. It is thus unsurprising that courts have offered inconsistent approaches to <b>product</b> <b>hopping.</b> They have paid varying levels {{of attention to the}} regulatory structure, offered a simplistic analysis of consumer choice, adopted an underinclusive antitrust standard based on coercion, and focused on whether the brand firm removed the original drug from the market. Entering this morass, we offer a new framework that courts, government enforcers, plaintiffs, and manufacturers can employ to analyze <b>product</b> <b>hopping.</b> This rigorous and balanced framework is the first to incorporate the economic characteristics of the pharmaceutical industry. For starters, it defines a “product hop” to include only those instances in which the brand manufacturer (1) reformulates the product {{in a way that makes}} the generic non-substitutable and (2) encourages doctors to write prescriptions for the reformulated product rather than the original. The test also offers two safe harbors, which are more deferential than current caselaw, to ensure that the vast majority of reformulations will not be subject to antitrust scrutiny. The analysis then examines whether a brand’s <b>product</b> <b>hop</b> passes the “no-economic-sense” test. In other words, would the reformulation make economic sense for the brand if it did not have the effect of impairing generic competition? Merely introducing new products would pass the test. Encouraging doctors to write prescriptions for the reformulated rather than the original product—“cannibalizing” the brand’s own sales—might not. Imposing antitrust liability on behavior that does not make business sense other than through its impairment of generic competition offers a conservative approach and minimizes “false positives” in which courts erroneously find liability. Showing just how far the courts have veered from justified economic analysis, the test would recommend a different analysis than that used in each of the five product-hopping cases that have been litigated to date, and a different outcome in two of them. By carefully considering the regulatory environment, practicalities of prescription drug markets, manufacturers’ desire for clear-cut rules, and consumers’ needs for a rule that promotes price competition without deterring valued innovations, the framework promises to improve and standardize the antitrust analysis of <b>product</b> <b>hopping...</b>|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{intersection}} between competition law rules on abuse of a dominant position and switching strategies employed by pharmaceutical originator companies. Switching {{is also known as}} ever-greening, <b>product</b> <b>hopping</b> or <b>product</b> life cycle strategies. It {{is one of the most}} topical issues in the patent-antitrust intersection today and consists in launching a slightly modified, second generation pharmaceutical, 1 - 2 years before the patent exclusivity expires for a first generation product. In this window originators try to migrate patients to a reformulated product. If successful, this will shield the originator from the effects of generic substitution for the first generation product. In the AstraZeneca-case the EU General Court held that a selective redrawal of marketing authorizations for a first generation product was an abuse of a dominant position under article 102 TFEU. This article focuses on other components in a switching strategy, especially the timing and content of marketing efforts by an originator company. Marketing is pro-competitive in almost all cases, but due to the special regulatory context in the pharmaceutical industry, marketing by an originator company can be used in an excluding fashion in the pharmaceutical industry. The conclusion is reached that casting the quality or price of the originator’s first generation product in a bad light, in comparison with the second generation product during exclusivity for the first generation product, may be an abuse by a dominant firm falling foul of article 102 TFEU. It is in effect equivalent to negative comparative advertising messages concerning a competitor’s soon to be launched product...|$|R

40|$|The {{bitterness}} of beer {{remains one of}} its most important flavour attribute. However, complexity surrounding bitterness perception alone represents a significant challenge in its understanding, in addition to other factors relating to production processes and raw materials used in making beer. The aim of this research was to better understand beer bitterness in terms of its intensity and quality, and how hopping technology (e. g. quantity and time of hop addition during the brewing process), hop aroma and variety may effect perceived bitterness intensity and quality. This project combined both analytical and sensorial analysis, and used statistical techniques to identify the key compounds driving bitterness perception. Analytical techniques were employed to quantify bitterness-contributing compounds and analytical bitterness units in beers alongside descriptive analysis of perceived sensory bitterness. Perceived sensory bitterness (both qualitative and quantitative) was assessed using a purpose developed list of well-defined bitterness attributes, to aid the characterisation of bitterness quality in beers. The impact of cross-modal flavour interactions on the perception of beer bitterness intensity and qualities was also investigated at varying analytical bitterness levels. Lastly, the effect of hop variety, and how this significant raw material affects perceived bitterness quality was also investigated using three distinctively different hop varieties (Hersbrucker, East Kent Goldings and Zeus). Results revealed a significant impact of the analytical profiles of beers, derived from the type of <b>hop</b> <b>products</b> and <b>hopping</b> technology adopted in beer production, on the perceived bitterness quality of beer. In general, beers high in hop acid compounds and polyphenols were, as expected, perceived to be higher in bitterness intensity. The results further showed that bitterness intensity also {{played a role in the}} perception of bitterness quality i. e. whether the beer was ‘harsh’, ‘lingering’ or ‘round’. However, beers high in these compounds were not always of ‘negative’ bitterness quality, and correspondingly lower amounts of these compounds did not always result in ‘positive’ bitterness qualities in beer. Results on the impact of cross-modal flavour interactions showed that hop aroma plays a crucial role in beer bitterness perception, and can modify the perception of bitterness intensity and quality as well as temporal profiles of bitterness in beer depending on analytical bitterness levels. The investigation into the impact of hop variety on perceived bitterness quality revealed hop-derived bitterness profiles relating to individual hop varieties, and further suggests that careful selection of the hop variety used for brewing is important for controlling perceived bitterness quality. This research provides a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach to understanding perceived beer bitterness and its associated qualities, with findings suggesting that besides bitterness intensity, the quality and overall impression of bitterness as perceived by consumers are significantly influenced by raw materials, production processes and other factors such as aroma which might be overlooked by brewers - but are likely to be significant for consumer preference and the success of a brand...|$|R

The Hatch-Waxman Act attempts to do so by simplifying the application process for generic drug manufacturers, allowing generic drug applications to circumvent the lengthy FDA testing and approval process that brand-name manufacturers must undergo. Though the Hatch-Waxman Act has successfully created a clear path to the market for generic drugs, it contains loopholes that allow brand name and generic companies to engage in practices aimed at maximizing monopoly profits, effectively depriving consumers of a generic option. Some of these practices include: reverse payments, citizen petitions, <b>product</b> <b>hopping,</b> and the misclassification of drugs. This Note argues that pharmaceutical companies have engaged in some of these practices and that the Hatch-Waxman Act must be amended to prevent these companies from continuing to circumvent the true intention of the Act...|$|R
40|$|The meiosis-specific HOP 1 gene is {{important}} both for crossing over between homologs and for production of viable spores, hop 1 diploids fail to assemble synaptonemal complex (SC), which normally provides {{the framework for}} meiotic synapsis, Immunochemical methods {{have shown that the}} 70 -kDa <b>HOP</b> 1 <b>product</b> is a component of the SC. To assess its molecular function,,ve have purified Hop 1 protein to homogeneity and shown that it forms dimers and higher oligomers in solution, Consistent with the zinc-finger motif in its sequence, the purified protein contained about 1 mol equivalent of zinc whereas mutant protein lacking a conserved cysteine within this motif did not, Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays with different forms of M 13 DNA showed that Hop 1 binds more readily to linear duplex DNA and negatively superhelical DNA than to nicked circular duplex DNA and even more weakly to single-stranded DNA, Linear duplex DNA binding was enhanced by the addition of Zn 2 + was stronger for longer DNA fragments, and was saturable to about 55 bp/protein monomer. Competitive inhibition of this binding by added oligonucleotides suggests preferential affinity for G-rich sequences and weaker binding to poly(dA-dT). Nuclear extracts of meiotic cells caused exonucleolytic degradation of linear duplex DNA if the extracts were prepared from hop 1 mutants; addition of purified Hop 1 conferred protection against this degradation. These findings suggest that Hop 1 acts in meiotic synapsis by binding to sites of double-strand break formation and helping to mediate their processing in the pathway-to meiotic recombination...|$|R
