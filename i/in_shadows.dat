Jon Irenicus and his sister Bodhi are the chief antagonists, Irenicus being the main villain of the game. Drizzt Do'Urden also makes an appearance; and if the player solicits his aid, he and his companions will later help the player.|$|E
5|$|Dishonoreds stealth {{system was}} {{originally}} {{based on that}} of the Thief series, which uses level lighting and shadows to determine whether an enemy can detect the player character's presence. However, {{it was decided that}} it was unrealistic that an enemy could stand directly in front of a player hiding <b>in</b> <b>shadows</b> and not detect them. It was also considered that making certain areas dark hid the designers' work and contrasted poorly with well-lit areas. Much of the ambient dialogue was written to be lengthy and add background detail to the game world and to entertain stealth players who may be in a single area for a long time. Conversely, main story dialogue was written to be short to compensate for the player being able to interrupt or kill the character who is speaking.|$|E
30|$|One of the {{difficulties}} <b>in</b> using <b>shadow</b> information is detecting <b>shadows</b> <b>in</b> input images.

Pixels with similar hue and saturation values and lower luminosity in hue-saturation-value (HSV) color space are classified as cast shadows [21].|$|R

5|$|Karas is {{the title}} for the city's {{appointed}} agents. Capable of transforming into automobiles and aircraft, they are suits of armor animated by human souls infused into them through Yurine's chanting of a Shinto prayer. Director Sato told his animators to enhance the Karas dark nature by drawing their faces <b>in</b> <b>shadows.</b> Fight scenes involving Karas take place mostly in dark settings shrouded with steam or lit with spotlights. Animators touched up film frames by hand, creating an effect different from cel-shaded animation. To make the Karas more menacing, they highlighted the eyes as if light bulbs were shining through them, a technique inspired by the suitmation practice of using light bulbs for the eyes of costumes. Producer Takaya Ibira explained the presence of ravens in Tokyo and the Tower of London, inspired him and Sato to model the agents of the city after them. He stated ravens {{are believed to be}} omens of good and bad in superstitions, and they always seem to be watching over the cities. This resonated with his view of the raven in the story Noah's Ark, which cursed Noah as it scouted for land. The presence of ravens all over Tokyo led Ibira to notice the same of cats and conceive the Yurines as catgirls.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, Bruno and George {{arrive at}} the same theatre, {{following}} Bruno's device to an energy source he was tracing. George decides to break in, finding Susarro, Petra, and Flap (who survived {{falling out of the}} train <b>in</b> <b>Shadows</b> of the Templars) interrogating Nico about her investigations; George quickly rescues her when Flap is left on his own with her, knocking him out in the process. After the pair reveal what led them to crossing paths with each other, they decide to continue searching the theatre, looking for the source of the energy Bruno detected. In the process, they find two keys - one in a safe, which is made of stone and decorated with crystals, and was the energy source Bruno detected, while the other, a stone, is found in a weird chamber, within a column of energy, bearing an omega symbol on it. Heading outside, after escaping from Susarro and Petra (who had been dealing with a mysterious, hooded man), George is tazed by an unknown assailant, who takes the strange energy key from him.|$|E
25|$|In this period, {{the methods}} of impressionistic are {{increasingly}} evident, particularly {{in the treatment of}} light: warm, direct light, for example direct sunlight with its red tones, and partially cold light <b>in</b> <b>shadows,</b> with blue tints, and violet transitional zones. Eckenfelder's ploughing horses become more monumental and infused with pathos, but by means of the use of light they remain a part of the landscape.|$|E

25|$|It {{seems that}} Prowler was {{deployed}} from Space Shuttle Atlantis during the STS-38 mission. STS-38 was launched from Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 22:48:13 UTC on 15 November 1990. The mission was officially acknowledged to have deployed a single satellite, USA-67, which observers have since identified {{as part of}} the Satellite Data System. Prowler was deployed from Atlantis at around 04:37 UTC on 17 November 1990, and boosted into geosynchronous transfer orbit by a PAM-D upper stage.

25|$|Aerial {{survey is}} {{conducted}} using cameras attached to airplanes, balloons, UAVs, or even Kites. A bird's-eye view {{is useful for}} quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document {{the status of the}} archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. Plants growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as middens) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening grain, which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes <b>in</b> <b>shadows.</b> Aerial survey also employs ultraviolet, infrared, ground-penetrating radar wavelengths, LiDAR and thermography.|$|E
25|$|Vermeer {{is known}} to have {{incorporated}} other artists' ideas, techniques and the poses in which they depict subjects. Some features of Diana share the effects and techniques of Rembrandt. Diana's stout figure is much like those in Rembrandt's work, and Vermeer used thick impasto brushwork following the lines of the folds of her clothing, as Rembrandt did. Also like Rembrandt, Vermeer cast the faces of the group <b>in</b> <b>shadows,</b> which gives a more expressive, moodier cast to the scene. Vermeer's painting is very similar in feeling to Rembrandt's Bathsheba, painted in 1654, a work Vermeer very likely saw firsthand, according to Wheelock. The poses of the woman whose feet is washed and the one doing the washing are similar. It is possible that Rembrandt's former pupil, Carel Fabritius (in Delft from 1650 until his death in late 1654), may have made Vermeer familiar with Rembrandt's work.|$|E

25|$|Based on the concept, for the {{majority}} Rouvas represents the dark and erotic side of the video, while Tamta the light and innocence. The video begins {{with the image of}} a man <b>in</b> <b>shadows</b> spinning on a chair and holding his head with his hand. It then forwards to a scene with Tamta, wearing leopard print lingerie, looking in a mirror and getting dressed, continuously alternating between these two scenes, while lights flash constantly. As the first verse begins, the shadowy figure is revealed to be Rouvas, with sweat dripping heavily down his face and an unidentified female hand touching him. A new scene is added with Tamta {{standing in front of a}} white background with the wind blowing, wearing various loose, flowy costumes, one of which is a Laskaris Haute Couture creation. The scenes constantly alternate between a single frame to a grid. Throughout the video Tamta wears five different costumes. It was also the first music video where Tamta can be seen with her new look.|$|E
500|$|Countershading {{was first}} {{described}} by the American artist Abbott Handerson Thayer, {{a pioneer in the}} theory of animal coloration. Thayer observed that whereas a painter takes a flat canvas and uses coloured paint to create the illusion of solidity by painting <b>in</b> <b>shadows,</b> animals such as deer are often darkest on their backs, becoming lighter towards the belly, creating (as zoologist Hugh Cott observed) the illusion of flatness, and against a matching background, of invisibility. Thayer's observation [...] "Animals are painted by Nature, darkest on those parts which tend to be most lighted by the sky's light, and vice versa" [...] is called Thayer's Law.|$|E
500|$|Thayer's close {{observation}} led him {{to notice}} what scientists such as Edward Bagnall Poulton {{were just beginning to}} describe. This was that many animals were [...] "painted" [...] the opposite way to how painters create the appearance of solidity in figures. A canvas is flat, and areas of uniform color painted on a canvas also appear flat. To make a body appear to have depth and solidity, the artist paints <b>in</b> <b>shadows</b> on the body itself. The top of an animal's back, facing the sky, remains bright, while it must become darker towards its underside. Thayer was excited to realize that by reversing such shading, nature could and did make animals appear flat. He was so passionate about this [...] "concealing coloration" [...] theory that he called it his [...] "second child". Poulton had noticed countershading in certain caterpillars, but he had not realized that the phenomenon was widespread, and he championed Thayer's theory in a 1902 article in Nature.|$|E

500|$|In {{reviews for}} the first five episodes of the series, Brian Lowry of Variety felt that [...] "Compared to Marvel's {{experience}} with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. for ABC, operating in Netflix's pay-to-view world is clearly liberating" [...] in terms of what can be done and shown. Matt Patches of Esquire added, [...] "The show's exterior recasts the high fructose, splash page aesthethic of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America with neo-noir attitude. Goddard and DeKnight drench Daredevil <b>in</b> <b>shadows</b> and blood." [...] He compared Daredevil to [...] "a TV spinoff" [...] of Christopher Nolans Batman films, and praised Cox and D'Onofrio's portrayals, while criticizing a subplot involving Nelson and Page and noting that the slow pacing of Daredevil, in which story may be stretched out more than needs be, could be a problem for binge-watchers. Victoria McNally of MTV felt the early episodes' fight sequences were [...] "filmed beautifully" [...] and enjoyed that they featured little CGI, while also calling Henson [...] "perfectly cast and endlessly amusing" [...] as Nelson.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most action games, stealth games {{challenge}} the player to avoid alerting enemies altogether. The core gameplay {{elements of the}} modern stealth game are to avoid combat, minimize noise, and strike enemies from the shadows. Completing objectives without being detected by any enemy, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "ghosting" [...] is a common approach to stealth games. Avoiding detection may {{be the only way to}} successfully complete a game, but there are usually multiple ways to achieve a goal with different pathways or styles of play. Players can hide behind objects or <b>in</b> <b>shadows,</b> and can strike or run past an enemy when the enemy is facing the other way. If the player attracts the attention of enemies, they usually must hide and wait until the enemies abandon their search. Thus, planning becomes important, as does trial-and-error. However, some stealth games put more emphasis on physical combat skill when the player is spotted. Some games offer a choice between killing or merely knocking out an enemy. When ghosting is optional, or even not well-supported by a game, players may still attempt to avoid combat for moral reasons or as a demonstration of skill.|$|E
500|$|Jean-Clement Sorret was {{the digital}} colorist for the film, this {{being one of}} the few {{instances}} in which a colorist received a spot in the opening credits. The film contains many coloring effects and [...] "density shifts" [...] of lighting to reflect the moods of the characters. For example, when Hayley gets angry, the colors would be edited to be of lower frequency. One effect used which, as far as the director is aware, had not been done in cinema before, was to brighten the lighting in filming and correct everything down in post-production. This allowed for facial details to be visible even while having a darkened atmosphere. According to the DVD extras, the process required a custom-built digital intermediate to be made and proved to be extremely difficult, with corrections having to be made frame-by-frame in some instances. This technique, known as ETTR, is a standard procedure in digital photography and cinematography to minimize the amount of noise <b>in</b> <b>shadows</b> and midtones. Early working titles of the script were Vendetta and Snip Snip. The producer wanted a title with a [...] "sugar and spice combination and a mixture of harsh roughness, innocence, and vulnerability", and settled on the title Hard Candy.|$|E
