5|$|In a loose, {{unstructured}} modernist narrative {{style that}} draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter. <b>However,</b> <b>over</b> time, the novel {{has come to be}} {{considered one of the most}} important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E

Early references consider her a foster-mother of Skanda, but in later texts she is identified with Skanda's consort, Devasena. In some early texts where Shashthi appears as an attendant of Skanda, she is said to cause diseases in the mother and child, and thus needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth. <b>However,</b> <b>over</b> time, this malignant goddess became seen as the benevolent saviour and bestower of children.|$|E

5|$|Constantine {{remained}} aloof {{from the}} Italian conflict, <b>however.</b> <b>Over</b> {{the spring and}} summer of 307AD, he had left Gaul for Britain to avoid any involvement in the Italian turmoil; now, instead of giving Maxentius military aid, he sent his troops against Germanic tribes along the Rhine. In 308AD, he raided the territory of the Bructeri, and made a bridge across the Rhine at Colonia Agrippinensium (Cologne). In 310AD, he marched to the northern Rhine and fought the Franks. When not campaigning, he toured his lands advertising his benevolence, and supporting the economy and the arts. His refusal to participate in the war increased his popularity among his people, and strengthened his power base in the West. Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307–308AD, but soon fell out with his son. In early 308AD, after a failed attempt to usurp Maxentius' title, Maximian returned to Constantine's court.|$|E
