40|$|With {{their high}} {{electrochemical}} efficiency, solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) and solid oxide electrolyzers (SOEs) offer viable means of reducing energy sector {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and storing surplus renewably-generated power. At present, these systems have operating temperatures of over 600 [*]°C. During start-up, following cooling or in an emergency shut-off situation, a premixed <b>safety</b> <b>gas</b> is necessary which prevents damage to the cell's anode substrate. To date, <b>safety</b> <b>gas</b> has been industrially produced and stored in compressed gas cylinders. Given an SOFC system's size, these cylinders must be transported and stored in close proximity and replaced following gas expenditure. The storage space required, {{as well as the}} continuous replacement of gas cylinders, increases system size and costs. This paper presents a solution to this problem {{in the form of a}} specially developed <b>safety</b> <b>gas</b> generator that generates an on-demand synthetic <b>safety</b> <b>gas</b> via the system's infrastructure. The functionality of this component is experimentally validated in tests conducted with a 4 -cell stack...|$|R

40|$|The {{decision}} {{reached at}} the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris provides to keep global warming temperature increase below 1. 5 °C, which should limit {{the impact of}} climate change. To achieve this, especially within the energy sector, new low emission and efficient energy conversion systems must be provided. The new systems must have a flexible part load capacity in order {{to compensate for the}} fluctuating influence of renewable energy sources on the power grid. Solid oxide fuel cell systems achieve a high partial load flexibility, and at the same time, a high electrical efficiency and thus fulfill today already the requirements for future energy conversion systems. The research objective of this work is an efficiency increase of a solid oxide fuel cell system developed at the Forschungszentrum Jülich, with a particular focus on the development of an innovative <b>safety</b> <b>gas</b> generator for the heating and cooling phases. In particular this means the removal of premixed <b>safety</b> <b>gas</b> compressed in gas cylinders, which currently limits the system’s suitability for everyday use. To achieve these objectives, dynamic component simulation models were developed {{on the basis of a}} stirred tank reactor cascade. With these models different system concepts were then investigated to ensure their feasibility and efficiency. Of the chosen criteria, the most suitable concept is a solid oxide fuel cell system with an anode off-gas recirculation, in combination with a low temperature blower. With this concept, electrical efficiency could be increased from 41 % to 60 %. In order to enable the release of premixed <b>safety</b> <b>gas,</b> a new <b>safety</b> <b>gas</b> release strategy was developed. This includes a component that uses the resources provided by the infrastructure to generate a hydrogen-rich atmosphere within the <b>safety</b> <b>gas</b> requiring operating phases. The functionality of the developed anode off-gas recirculation concept, as well as of the protection gas strategy, has been experimentally demonstrated. Through the combination of dynamic simulation models and experiments, a highly efficient system, consisting of anode off-gas recirculation and own <b>safety</b> <b>gas</b> generation, was achieved. Thereby, the challenges of operating the system could be resolved by developing a recirculation measuring method, an operation strategy to achieve maximum electrical efficiency, an analysis of the carbon-free operation window, as well as an innovative operating strategy within the <b>safety</b> <b>gas</b> requiring operating phases...|$|R
