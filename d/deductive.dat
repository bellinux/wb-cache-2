5|$|More {{in-depth}} investigations {{were conducted}} by Esther Levenson, Pessia Tsamir, and Dina Tirosh, who interviewed a pair of sixth-grade students who were performing highly in their mathematics class. One student preferred <b>deductive</b> explanations of mathematical claims, while the other preferred practical examples. Both students initially thought that 0 was neither even nor odd, for different reasons. Levenson et al. demonstrated how the students' reasoning reflected their concepts of zero and division.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{was asked}} to write an essay for the layman {{describing}} what mathematics is, and produced a beautiful analysis. He explained that mathematics straddles the world between the empirical and logical, arguing that geometry was originally empirical, but Euclid constructed a logical, <b>deductive</b> theory. However, he argued, that {{there is always the}} danger of straying too far from the real world and becoming irrelevant sophistry.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Conan Doyle KStJ, DL (1859–1930) was a Scottish {{writer and}} physician. In {{addition}} to the series of stories chronicling the activities of Sherlock Holmes and his friend Dr John Watson {{for which he is}} well-known, Doyle wrote {{on a wide range of}} topics, both fictional and non-fictional. In 1876 Doyle entered the University of Edinburgh Medical School, where he became a pupil of Joseph Bell, whose <b>deductive</b> processes impressed his pupil so much that the teacher became the chief model for Holmes. Doyle began writing while still a student, and in October 1879 he had his first work—"The Mystery of the Sasassa Valley"—published in Chambers's Journal. He continued writing short works—both fictional and non-fictional—throughout his career, and had over 200 stories and articles published.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{he became}} {{a student at the}} Melbourne Teachers Training College to obtain formal {{teaching}} qualifications. After his graduation in December 1910, he was awarded a scholarship to complete an education diploma at the University of Melbourne, but decided to defer for a year in order to teach at schools in country Victoria. He became a schoolteacher, teaching first at Tragowell in the Swan Hill district, and then at Fine View State School in the Horsham district. In 1911 he entered Trinity College at the University of Melbourne. After failing an exam in <b>deductive</b> logic, he decided to quit the state school system, and in 1912 took up a position at The Armidale School in the New England district of New South Wales. In 1914 he moved to the prestigious Melbourne Grammar School.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro. Eshiro {{had come up with}} the idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations, and Yamazaki had the idea to have it be about <b>deductive</b> reasoning and crime scene investigation. The game was specifically designed to be different from previous Ace Attorney titles, with a larger focus on the environment. The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye, a character from earlier games in the series, as the lead character, but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity. They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth, as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games, where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters; to do this, they included direct control of Edgeworth, and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} {{philosophy}} of science trace back to Plato and Aristotle who distinguished {{the forms of}} approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of abductive, <b>deductive,</b> and inductive inference, and also analyzed reasoning by analogy. The eleventh century Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied geometry, especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the reflection and refraction of light. Roger Bacon (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized {{by many to be}} the father of modern scientific method. His view that mathematics was essential to a correct understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.|$|E
5|$|Eshiro {{said that}} they could have set the game in a {{courtroom}} {{similar to that of the}} main series and made a few additions, but that it would not have been very interesting; instead they moved the game to crime scenes, and added several new gameplay elements. Yamazaki was the one who came up with the idea of making a game about <b>deductive</b> reasoning and crime scene investigation. Because of this theme, it made sense to them to include the Ace Attorney character Ema Skye in the game, as she is portrayed as wanting to be a forensic scientist. Yamazaki originally suggested that Ema should be the main character, but based on fan feedback, they decided to use the more popular character Miles Edgeworth instead. Figuring out how to move the game from the courtroom to the crime scene was a challenge for the development team. The team also thought that it was difficult to make the game feel new while also making sure it felt similar to the game series. Because of the new gameplay systems that all had to be created from scratch, Ace Attorney Investigations took longer to develop than previous Ace Attorney games had.|$|E

25|$|<b>Deductive</b> {{reasoning}} {{concerns the}} logical consequence of given premises {{and is the}} form of reasoning most closely connected to logic.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Henkin {{proved that}} the standard <b>deductive</b> system for first-order logic is sound, complete, and effective for second-order logic with Henkin semantics, and the <b>deductive</b> system with comprehension and choice principles is sound, complete, and effective for Henkin semantics using only models that satisfy these principles.|$|E
25|$|A <b>deductive</b> {{system for}} a logic {{is a set of}} {{inference}} rules and logical axioms that determine which sequences of formulas constitute valid proofs. Several <b>deductive</b> systems can be used for second-order logic, although none can be complete for the standard semantics (see below). Each of these systems is sound, which means any sentence they can be used to prove is logically valid in the appropriate semantics.|$|E
25|$|A <b>deductive</b> {{system is}} sound if any formula {{that can be}} derived in the system is logically valid. Conversely, a <b>deductive</b> system is {{complete}} if every logically valid formula is derivable. All of the systems {{discussed in this article}} are both sound and complete. They also share the property {{that it is possible to}} effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called effective.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, a theorem is a {{statement}} that has been proved {{on the basis of}} previously established statements, such as other theorems, and generally accepted statements, such as axioms. A theorem is a logical consequence of the axioms. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a <b>deductive</b> system. The proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement. In light of the requirement that theorems be proved, the concept of a theorem is fundamentally <b>deductive,</b> in contrast to the notion of a scientific law, which is experimental.|$|E

25|$|Andreas Speiser has {{advocated}} {{the view that}} the construction of the 5 regular solids is the chief goal of the <b>deductive</b> system canonized in the Elements. Much of the information in Book XIII is probably derived from the work of Theaetetus.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{distinction}} between number and magnitude, geometry became the only method that could take into account incommensurable ratios. Because previous numerical foundations were still incompatible with the concept of incommensurability, Greek focus shifted away from those numerical conceptions such as algebra and focused almost exclusively on geometry. In fact, in many cases algebraic conceptions were reformulated into geometrical terms. This may account for why we still conceive of x2 or x3 as x squared and x cubed instead of x second power and x third power. Also crucial to Zeno’s work with incommensurable magnitudes was the fundamental focus on <b>deductive</b> reasoning that resulted from the foundational shattering of earlier Greek mathematics. The realization that some basic conception within the existing theory was at odds with reality necessitated a complete and thorough investigation of the axioms and assumptions that underlie that theory. Out of this necessity, Eudoxus developed his method of exhaustion, a kind of reductio ad absurdum that “…established the <b>deductive</b> organization on the basis of explicit axioms…” as well as “…reinforced the earlier decision to rely on <b>deductive</b> reasoning for proof.” This method of exhaustion {{is the first step in}} the creation of calculus.|$|E
25|$|A key {{property}} of <b>deductive</b> systems {{is that they}} are purely syntactic, so that derivations can be verified without considering any interpretation. Thus a sound argument is correct in every possible interpretation of the language, regardless whether that interpretation is about mathematics, economics, or some other area.|$|E
25|$|The {{rigorous}} <b>deductive</b> {{methods of}} geometry found in Euclid's Elements of Geometry were relearned, and {{further development of}} geometry in the styles of both Euclid (Euclidean geometry) and Khayyam (algebraic geometry) continued, resulting in an abundance of new theorems and concepts, many of them very profound and elegant.|$|E

25|$|Thales (635-543 BC) of Miletus (now {{in southwestern}} Turkey), {{was the first}} to whom {{deduction}} in mathematics is attributed. There are five geometric propositions for which he wrote <b>deductive</b> proofs, though his proofs have not survived. Pythagoras (582-496 BC) of Ionia, and later, Italy, then colonized by Greeks, may have been a student of Thales, and traveled to Babylon and Egypt. The theorem that bears his name may not have been his discovery, but he {{was probably one of the}} first to give a <b>deductive</b> proof of it. He gathered a group of students around him to study mathematics, music, and philosophy, and together they discovered most of what high school students learn today in their geometry courses. In addition, they made the profound discovery of incommensurable lengths and irrational numbers.|$|E
25|$|Different sets of {{derivation}} rules {{give rise}} to different interpretations {{of what it means}} for an expression to be a theorem.

25|$|Looking at logical categorizations of {{different}} types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between <b>deductive</b> reasoning and inductive reasoning. Formal logic has been described as the science of deduction. The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as informal logic or critical thinking.|$|E
25|$|From the Middle Ages onwards, {{categorical}} syllogism and syllogism {{were usually}} used interchangeably. This article is concerned only with this traditional use.
