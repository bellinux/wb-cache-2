5000|$|In {{a last-ditch}} effort to revive the Jaguar, Atari Corp. tried to play down the other two {{consoles}} by proclaiming the Jaguar was the only [...] "64-bit" [...] system. This claim is questioned by some, because the CPU (68000) and GPU executed a 32-bit instruction-set, but sent control signals to the 64-bit graphics co-processors (or [...] "graphics accelerators"). Atari Corp.'s reasoning that the 32-bit [...] "Tom" [...] and [...] "Jerry" [...] chips work in tandem to {{add up to a}} 64-bit system was ridiculed in a mini-editorial by Electronic Gaming Monthly, which commented that [...] "If Sega <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>math</b> for <b>the</b> Sega Saturn <b>the</b> way Atari <b>did</b> <b>the</b> <b>math</b> for their 64-bit Jaguar system, the Sega Saturn would be a 112-bit monster of a machine." [...] On the other side, Next Generation, while giving a mostly negative review of the Jaguar, maintained that it is a true 64-bit system, since the data path from the DRAM to the CPU and Tom and Jerry chips is 64 bits wide. Design specs for the console allude to the GPU or DSP being capable of acting as a CPU, leaving the Motorola 68000 to read controller inputs. In practice, however, many developers used the Motorola 68000 to drive gameplay logic.|$|R

5000|$|In {{order to}} reduce the amount of time {{consumed}} by these steps, most modern CPUs use a technique known as instruction pipelining in which the instructions pass through several sub-units in turn.

40|$|Using the {{language}} of mathematics, Professor Polk Wagner has recently argued that the impossibility of fully appropriating the value of information in a rightsholder leads to the surprising conclusion that expanding the degree of control of intellectual property rights will, in the long run, increase {{the sum total of}} information not subject to ownership claims and therefore available as part of the cultural and technological base on which new growth and development can occur. Indeed, he claims that open information will grow according to the formula for compound interest, where the interest rate is 100 % plus or minus a factor z supposedly related to creation incentives.

5000|$|A similar {{practice}} to notes inégales occurs from the 20th {{century to the}} present day, in jazz, although the term [...] "swung note" [...] is used by jazz musicians and listeners.
