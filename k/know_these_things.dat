5|$|Earp's {{anger at}} Holliday's ethnic slur may {{indicate}} that his feelings for Josephine were more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because {{at that time in}} the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus in Tombstone was not public knowledge. Otero could <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> only if he had a relationship with someone who had personal knowledge of the individuals involved.|$|E
25|$|Before I {{experienced}} {{the horror of}} that attack, I was quick to call coward or yellow anyone who showed fear under any circumstances. Nevermore. I donâ€™t <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> but they speak truth to one. I am not a psychologist, nor a statistician, and less of a philosopher; but the depth of emotion, the dreads of fear, the referees of horrors, and the concentration of self that led me to make this observation, the fear impulse, or perhaps, better said, the (impulses caused) by fear, are stronger, more demanding than either that of love or hunger...|$|E

Then they are sent off with what they can carry.... How can anyone <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> and walk around free?"

60|$|The warriors <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> <b>knew</b> {{them better}} perhaps {{than a simple}} warrior should have known them. And so it was here in the temple that he looked for the aid that he sought in the {{carrying}} out of whatever design he had.|$|R
6000|$|Now, when I, who am {{not paid}} to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> know them daily on the {{evidence}} of my senses and experience; when I know that the Ruffian never jostles a lady in the streets, or knocks a hat off, but in order that the Thief may profit, is it surprising that I should require from those who ARE paid to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> prevention of them? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, my dear," [...] {{answered}} Mr. Merrill, still pacing, [...] "two wrongs don't make a right, I admit. I've <b>known</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> a long time, and I've {{thought about}} {{them a good}} deal.

6000|$|... "Boys outgrow what is amiss in them? From {{bad boys}} spring good men? Sir, 'the child is {{father of the}} man;' hence, as all boys are rascals, so are all men.

5000|$|Several years later, Orestes, now {{converted}} to Christianity, is prefect of Alexandria.

60|$|The speaker ceased, {{or rather}} {{suspended}} utterance, and gazed upon {{me with an}} eye of understanding. I held the bottle between our eyes and the fire, indicated with my thumb {{the depth of the}} draught, and shoved it over to him; for was he not Palitlum, the Drinker? Many tales had he told me, and long had I waited for this scriptless scribe to speak of the things concerning Ligoun; for he, of all men living, <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> best.|$|R
25|$|Head-to-head races favor fast starters, and War Admiral's speed {{from the}} gate was well known.

From the {{scheduled}} walk-up start, few gave {{him a chance to}} lead War Admiral into the first turn. Smith <b>knew</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> and trained Seabiscuit to run against this type, using a starting bell and a whip to give the horse a Pavlovian burst of speed from the start.|$|R

6000|$|... "It's my {{business}} to <b>know</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> Think we can't {{tell the difference}} between the tracks of a led horse and a ridden one? The only times two horses trot close together at an even distance is when one's rider has both bridles, or when they're yoked to a wagon pole. However, I've come to ask if you can throw any light on the matter? You and Jernyngham were partners, in a way, weren't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{thus have}} I in few words showed you {{the grace of}} the Spirit, and how it putteth forth itself towards the saving of the soul.
