5|$|People {{sometimes}} suspected vampirism when a cadaver did {{not look}} as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred.

40|$|A {{large number}} of <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> are {{referred}} to forensic autopsy halls for medicolegal examination. They can {{be a source of}} transmission of infectious diseases through direct contact or autopsy tools. The main aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the virus infection rates in the <b>dead</b> <b>bodies.</b> One thousand consecutive <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> that had been referred to autopsy hall of Legal Medicine Bureau of Tehran, Iran, during 2016, were included. The blood samples were analyzed in the laboratory for detection of HBs Ag, HBs Ab, HIV Ab, and HCV Ab, after providing informed consent from legal next of kin of the <b>dead</b> <b>bodies.</b> The general characteristics of the <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> were also collected by a checklist. Forty-seven cases of HIV seropositivity, 80 cases of HBs Ag seropositivity, and 97 cases for HCV Ab seropositivity were found. Among them, 27 cases of HIV, 40 cases of anti-HBC positive, and 94 cases of RIBA testing positive for HCV were proved through confirmatory tests. In other words, 2. 6 % of the <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> were infected with HIV, 3. 8 % with HBV, and 9 % with HCV. The total infection rate was 15. 5 %. This is a worrying risk for pathologist and autopsy technicians...|$|R

5|$|Dr. Adam Pierce, a {{scientist}} at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, intercepts a visual transmission from Firewalker, a mobile robot sent by a volcanic research project on Mount Avalon near Bend, Oregon.

5|$|Faramir first {{encountered}} the hobbits Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee in Ithilien and recognized {{them to be}} the Halflings mentioned in his dreams. Faramir questioned Frodo of his quest, and Frodo revealed that he, along with eight other companions including Boromir, had set out from Rivendell. During the interrogation, Faramir asked often about Boromir, since he knew, although Frodo at that point did not, that Boromir was already dead. One night, while on guard, Faramir waded down to the Anduin river after seeing a boat there. It contained the <b>dead</b> <b>body</b> of his brother, {{who had been killed}} by Orcs after Frodo left the group.|$|E

In May 2004 this journal published the first-ever review article to compre-hensively assess the scientific evidence on the infectious disease risks of <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> following natural disasters, along with an editorial commenting on the persistence of myths concerning the dangers allegedly posed by <b>dead</b> <b>bodies.</b> This paper assesses the impact that the review ar-ticle and the editorial have had on the way that health risks from <b>dead</b> <b>bodies</b> have been reported by the media over the following year, especially focusing on the South Asian tsunami disaster of December 2004.

5|$|In 1597, King James wrote a {{dissertation}} on witchcraft titled Daemonologie {{in which he}} wrote the belief that demons could possess both {{the living and the}} dead.

As a devil borrows a <b>dead</b> <b>body,</b> it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.|$|E

5|$|Just as Julie and Keys {{celebrate}} their victory, the dog, without warning, turns {{its attention to}} Carruthers and brutally attacks him. The dog had not previously shown any aggression towards him--no explanation for this is given, but implications go that the dog's programming has somehow been reversed, though that was never Keys's intention, or that Carruthers has a similarity to the dog's original owner whom the dog hates now. To save his employer's life, Keys is forced to shoot and kill the dog, and the film ends {{with the image of}} the dog's body lying {{in the center of the}} training enclosure while Julie weeps over his <b>dead</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
