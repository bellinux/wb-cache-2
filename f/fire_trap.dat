Separate magnetic and analog optical audio heads are built into the mechanism itself, enabling all 5/70 magnetic and 4/35 optical formats to be projected without the need to adjust or replace any audio components. The change of gauge is done by swapping some gate components, pad roller assemblies, reel spindles and the lens, {{and in some cases}} making minor adjustments to the lamphouse. This procedure can be completed by a competent projectionist in 5-10 minutes, which is a major reason for the DP70's popularity with venues that show 4/35 and 5/70 prints interchangeably.|$|E
5000|$|After the war, it {{was left}} empty, leading to protests from {{returning}} veterans who faced a housing crisis. In 1946, a group of veterans and squatters occupied the building until they were forced out by the Governor General's Foot Guards. The event drew enough attention that Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King mandated that it be turned into subsidized housing.In 1950, the military reoccupied the structure and it served a number of purposes over the next decades, eventually becoming the home of 28 Service battalion, 763 Communications Regiment (formerly 3 Signals Regiment RC Signals) and several minor Army reserve units. The aged building soon became a problem. Constant minor renovations left the interior a warren of hallways and rooms.

5000|$|The Lakeview School was a <b>fire</b> <b>trap,</b> though {{buildings}} designed similarly {{could be}} found throughout the nation. During the fire, the school's masonry exterior acted as a chimney, sucking flame upward as the wooden interior burned. Open stairways {{and the absence of}} fire breaks enhanced the chimney effect. Lakeview had only two exits and fire quickly blocked the front door. Children rushed to the rear door, but, in a vestibule narrowed by partitions, they stumbled and climbed on top of one another, forming a pile that completely blocked the exit. Though later accounts sometimes described children pinned against inward-swinging doors, Lakeview’s doors opened outward. The vestibule, however, created an impassable bottleneck for the crowd trying to rush through it. Collinwood's small volunteer fire department and horse-drawn engines arrived too late and were ill-equipped to battle the inferno in front of them. In less than an hour, the three floors and the roof of the Lakeview School collapsed into the basement, leaving only a hollowed out brick ruin. Almost half of the children and two teachers in the building died.|$|E

5000|$|Overcrowding persisted {{at the new}} facility, {{made worse}} in 1924 when Topeka's Fire Marshall closed the school's 4th floor, calling it [...] "the biggest <b>fire</b> <b>trap</b> in the city". [...] A {{committee}} planning {{the construction of a}} new high school recommended that one large school be built, and that it occupy an entire city block. They wished it to be [...] "an addition to the City's public buildings, and not just another building". [...] Bishop James Wise offered to sell the grounds of Bethany College and other church property for a price of $142,000, and in 1928, Topeka voters approved issuing bonds of $1.1 million (=$14 million in 2014 adjusted for inflation) to finance construction of the new Topeka High School. [...] Thomas Williamson (an alumnus from 1907) and Ted Griest were selected as architects, and Linus Burr Smith as designer. [...] Construction of the new school took 18 months, and the total cost was $1.8 million. The school opened in September 1931, and there were 2000 students enrolled by the following year. A spar from the USS Constitution ("Old Ironsides") was acquired with the assistance of Vice President Curtis, and mounted on a nautical base in the plaza to serve as a flagpole. It was dedicated in October 1931. After years of wear, a replacement spar, also from the USS Constitution, was installed in 2004. Topeka High's 'Hoehner Auditorium' was selected as the site for the inauguration of Kansas Governor Payne Ratner, on January 9, 1939. In 1957, Time and Newsweek listed Topeka High among the 38 best schools in the nation.|$|E
30|$|Without thinning, oak and {{red maple}} {{seedlings}} {{are caught in}} a <b>fire</b> <b>trap</b> (Grady and Hoffmann 2012). In our study, 80 % to 90 % of seedlings remained less than 30 cm tall after one or three fires. Although fire behavior was not assessed as an objective in this study, the fire temperatures we obtained were within the ranges reported by others for dormant season burns in Eastern deciduous forests (Franklin et al. 1997, Iverson et al. 2004, Phillips and Waldrop 2008), but may have been insufficient to cause mortality of shade-casting overstory trees. Without thinning, available light is too low to support rapid rates of height growth for either oaks or red maple, and frequent fire {{in the short term}} sets back shoot development. Burns that reduce post-fire seedling emergence of red maple have been documented (Glasgow and Matlack 2007), and Brose (2010) noted that seedling-origin dominant stems were only found in controls, not in any of the burn treatments. With thinning, oak seedlings that were burned also appeared to be caught in a <b>fire</b> <b>trap,</b> with fewer stems tallied in the largest size classes. There was no clear pattern for red maple seedlings under thinning and fire, as distribution among height classes was somewhat even. In these systems, juvenile sprouting must be considered part of the recruitment strategy. Without thinning, red maple sprouts were not trapped in the smaller size classes following one fire, a trend found elsewhere (Arthur et al. 1998, Albrecht and McCarthy 2006). With three fires, red maple sprouts were maintained as smaller stems. Under thinning, oak and maple sprouts responded favorably to one fire, with over 60 % of the sprouts in the largest size class for oak and over 90 % for maple; with three fires, oak sprouts did not recruit into larger sizes. The key to developing large oak advance reproduction is to have sufficient light in the understory and time between fires to permit positive net root growth. Then, when the oak seedling sprouts are competitive, they need further release from overstory competition and a fire-free period to allow for recruitment into the overstory. Reproduction needs to reach a threshold size before it can escape from fire. Longer fire-free periods (antecedent periods as described by Arthur et al. 2015) may allow seedlings and sprouts enough time to grow into a fire-resistant size (Jacqmain et al. 1999, Fan et al. 2012, Grady and Hoffman 2012).|$|E

We use this method to demonstrate a landscape wide expansion of closed forest (42 % increase in total coverage) in the Australian monsoon tropics over the past five decades. Retrospective habitat suitability models (HSI) of closed forest derived using four landscape measures (drainage distance, slope angle, aspect and elevation) for imagery taken in 1947 correctly forecast the subsequent spatial distribution of the expansion, with topographic fire protection primarily determining the closed-forest distribution. The dynamics of the closed forest-savanna boundary were predicted accurately by generalised linear models, with closed-forest expansion in fire-protected sites along forest edges and regression in the more fire-prone areas. Two factors may plausibly explain the expansion of closed forests. First, eco-ethnographic records stress the skilful use of fire by Aboriginal people in protecting isolated and locally resource-rich closed-forest patches. Second, the recent global increase in atmospheric CO 2 may be changing the competitive balance between savanna and forest by enabling C 3 trees to grow fast enough to escape the <b>fire</b> <b>trap</b> presented by flammable C 4 grasses...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to gain a {{comprehensive}} understanding of the patterns of carbon partitioning, storage and remobilization in Acacia karroo during the juvenile life history stage. Tuber total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) concentrations and δ¹³C values were determined in plants from two different stages in the juvenile life history of A. karroo. These were one year after a fire when the plant consisted of numerous leafy shoots or coppices (coppicing stage) and three years after a fire when the plant consisted of one pole like stem (gulliver stage). Gullivers were found to have mean TNC pools of 150 g and mean TNC concentrations of 33 %. Coppices had mean TNC pools of 97 g and TNC concentrations of 24 %. Both total TNC pools and TNC concentrations in gullivers were significantly higher (p 1 ‰) in ¹³C compared to both coppicing plants (p < 0. 01) and adults (p < 0. 05). The negative δ¹³C values in coppice stems suggest that their growth is not based on stored carbon. The enriched δ¹³C values found in the gulliver stems support the hypothesis that carbon reserves are utilized to achieve fast growth rates in an attempt to escape the <b>fire</b> <b>trap.</b> However, the small magnitude of the differences in δ¹³C between the two stages suggests post-burn regrowth is derived from both current photosynthate and stored carbon...|$|E
40|$|Various {{morphological}} {{and life}} history attributes of Acacia karroo Hayne. were investigated in five populations from three environments in South Africa: forest (Cape Vidal, Natal), arid shrubland (Prince Albert, karoo) and savanna (Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game reserve and ltala Game reserve, Natal). I aimed to elucidate on the distinctive characteristics required for trees {{to survive in}} savannas. The combination of frequent fires and intense herbivory in savanna environments creates a disturbance regime not encountered by trees in other situations and {{it was expected that}} A. karroo would display specific adaptations of growth form, life history, and reproductive ecology - adaptations which would reflect the strong selective pressure imposed by fire and herbivory on juvenile savanna trees to grow above flame height and browse limit in order to recruit into the mature canopy. A. karroo in savannas was found to have an unbranched, vertical growth form, and is thus maximising height gain. Reproduction was delayed until the trees were above the reach of flames and herbivores. Savanna A. karroo trees had fewer, smaller spines than trees in the other two environments, even though spines are generally considered to be effective in defense against mammalian herbivores. It is therefore suggested that a combination of low 'apparency' to browsers and rapid growth rate is an effective herbivore avoidance strategy in conditions where the need to escape from the <b>fire</b> <b>trap</b> makes a trade-off of growth rate for defensive structures unacceptable. The architecture of mature savanna trees reflects their history of rapid growth in earlier stages and they have smaller canopies, and thus lower reproductive capabilities, than equivalently sized trees in other environments...|$|E
