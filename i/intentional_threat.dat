40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis focuses {{on the characteristics of}} water as the basic structural element of the life on the Earth. It also mentions regulations related to critical infrastructure, water protection and water management. It describes water management system of the Czech Republic and the South Bohemian Region. It similarly characterizes the most probable chemical, biological or radiological water contaminants that might be abused by a man in the case of trespassing into waterworks system objects. The aim of the thesis was to map possible threats to the waterworks system and to propose follow-up measures preventing the South Bohemian Waterworks System from abuse. Upon identification of possible threats in the territory of South Bohemia and {{from the point of view}} of the extent of the thesis the text then focuses on <b>intentional</b> <b>threat</b> of waterworks object by a man. The research part first deals with more detailed description of the South Bohemia Waterworks System, from drinking water via its pumping, treatment, storage to its supply to final consumers. The system of drinking water supply to inhabitants of South Bohemia is divided into sectors by means of AKIS method here. A questionnaire to employees working in the water management sphere was based on this division and particularly vulnerability and the level of security measures in the individual South Bohemian Waterworks System sectors was evaluated from the information based on their answers. In the second plan the research part of the thesis focuses on description of security elements used in South Bohemian Waterworks System objects accompanied by my own photo documentation of objects and areas administered by the South Bohemian Waterworks Union. The elements of passive and active protection used by the South Bohemian Waterworks Union are documented and described here. Application of two operation analysis methods relates to this part. Quantitative research of security of waterworks objects based on evaluation of the best secured object of the South Bohemian Waterworks System was first performed. The obtained results enable us to determine which of the South Bohemian Waterworks System premises has the best active and passive security against trespass of unauthorized persons. To assess relevancy of the quantitative security research the method of relative comparison of waterworks objects security and its consequent interpretation by the security index is also used. The security index describes object protection against possible trespass within the whole area of the object. Application of this method brings numeric interpretation and identification of the overall security of the South Bohemian Waterworks System with regard to preference of the monitored parameters. The same result is achieved by both the methods. The applied operation analysis methods have revealed that the heart of the South Bohemian Waterworks System, the Plav drinking water treatment plant, the only drinking water treatment plant of South Bohemia supplying majority of South Bohemia inhabitants with drinking water, is the best protected object. Pumping stations and water towers are further well secured objects. There are also completely unsecured object in the South Bohemian Waterworks System. The conclusion contains some measures that should prevent unauthorized persons from trespassing into all waterworks objects and thus protect drinking water against contamination. As the observation has revealed the protection of waterworks objects should be improved with regard to the worsening safety situation in the world. This also involves the costs the South Bohemian Waterworks Union should invest in security to introduce the most up-to-date security elements into practice. We may conclude that the major part of waterworks objects are secured against abuse both passively and actively...|$|E

In order to protect city from <b>intentional</b> <b>threats,</b> the urban defense engineering has become {{an important part of}} urban planning and construction. Based on that, the security planning on urban infrastructure is required to be improved and corresponding security surveillance and early warning systems need to be enhanced. More importantly, the macro-level study of defense resource allocation should be given more considerations. In this study, a resource allocation model focusing on urban defense under the situation with intentional attacking is developed. In this resource allocation model, the rationality level of attackers, the interrelation among targets and other related problems under intentional attacks are all considered. Besides, this model is also validated by using an example, and in this example, the impact of several important parameters have been discussed. It is shown that the expected loss of the optimized resource allocation plan derived from this model is smaller than that of the population proportion-based allocation plan and average-based allocation plan. It also shows that the correlation coefficient of targets has a significant impact of the defense resource allocation.

Given these problems with existing frameworks, in the present proposal I provide algorithms for secure optimal policies based on the MDP/Dec-POMDP frameworks with no adversary model.

The first part argues that rational models can provide significant insights on the emergence and current patterns of terrorism and piracy. These findings could lead to new priorities or to more nuanced interventions in response to these threats. The second part focuses on the direct and indirect costs of both terrorism and organised crime. EUSECON provided new data about the scope of related illegal economic activities and explored the sensitivity of markets, societies and polities in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. It emerges that political actors are at greatest risk of over-responding, whereas mature economies display a high degree of resilience. Finally, the third part discusses economic approaches to policy evaluation. EUSECON clarified the benefits of transnational security cooperation, but also highlights the difficulties of rigorous costeffectiveness and cost-benefit calculations. Therefore, a more evidence-based approach to security policymaking, which is increasingly touted by EU decision-makers, remains elusive. In conclusion, European security policy needs further scrutiny from an economic perspective, in order to answer the increasing complexity of security challenges under the increasing financial or political constraints. ...|$|R

On the other hand, security engineer sees the emergency door a loophole that can provide access to the building to unauthorized personnel and therefore must be secured. Although this is the typical way to distinguish the two fields, it also exist another distinction: “Security is concerned with the risks originating from the environment and potentially impacting the system, whereas safety deals with the hazard arising from the system and potentially impacting the environment” [1].

National risk assessments usually consist of several phases; scenario development, scenario analysis by experts, assessment by bureaucrats and compilation of a matrix depicting the scores of the scenarios in relation to each other in terms of probability and impact. They generally examine both <b>intentional</b> <b>threats</b> and accidents that might impact the functioning of infrastructure and society in general with nearly the same methodology; hence they may be described as using an all hazard approach. Most of the writing on national risk assessments has focused on issues related to the methods; how likelihood and impact are scored as well as how these are combined to reflect a specific point in the risk matrix. The actual use and results of national risk assessments do not appear to have received similar attention, perhaps because they are still a relatively new phenomena. This is an interesting issue because actual use of risk assessments, even at lower levels of government in terms of informing and developing policy, appears to be challenging.

40|$|UnrestrictedRecent {{advances}} {{in the field of}} agent/multiagent systems brings us closer to agents acting in real world domains, which can be uncertain and many times adversarial. Security, commonly defined as the ability to deal with <b>intentional</b> <b>threats</b> from other agents is a major challenge for agents or agent-teams deployed in these adversarial domains. Such adversarial scenarios arise {{in a wide variety of}} situations that are becoming increasingly important such as agents patrolling to provide perimeter security around critical infrastructure or performing routine security checks. These domains have the following characteristics: (a) The agent or agent-team needs to commit to a security policy while the adversaries may observe and exploit the policy committed to. (b) The agent/agent-team potentially faces different types of adversaries and has varying information available about the adversaries (thus limiting the agents' ability to model itsadversaries).; To address security in such domains, I developed two types of algorithms. First, when the agent has no model of its adversaries, my key idea is to randomize agent's policies to minimize the information gained by adversaries. To that end, I developed algorithms for policy randomization for both the Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and the Decentralized-Partially Observable MDPs (Dec POMDPs). Since arbitrary randomization can violate quality constraints (for example, theresource usage should be below a certain threshold or key areas must be patrolled with a certain frequency), my algorithms guarantee quality constraints on the randomized policies generated. For efficiency, I provide a novel linear program for randomized policy generation in MDPs, and then build on this program for a heuristic solution for Dec-POMDPs. Second, when the agent has partial model of the adversaries, I model the security domain as a Bayesian Stackelberg game where the agent's model of the adversary includes a probability distribution over possible adversary types. While the optimal policy selection for a Bayesian Stackelberg game is known to be NP-hard, my solution approach based on an efficient Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) provides significant speedups over existing approaches while obtaining the optimal solution. The resulting policy randomizes the agent's possible strategies, while taking into account the probability distribution over adversary types. Finally, I provide experimental results for all my algorithms, illustrating the new techniques developed have enabled us to find optimal secure policies efficiently for an increasingly important class of security domains...|$|R

In this paper, we report on results of an evaluation of the potentials of SocialTV by considering end-users' privacy based on lab and field trials. In these trials we enabled eighteen people of various ages and expertise to use centralized as well as decentralized (group-centric) solutions for SocialTV by means of a Web-based software prototype. Further, we describe the followed methodology used by the evaluation in order to allow porting it for future evaluations in other social contexts...|$|R
40|$|The Information System Security is {{characterized}} by an organized frame of significances, perceptions, concepts, policies, procedures, techniques and measures that are {{required in order to}} protect individual resources – assets of the Information System, but also the entire system, from each <b>intentional</b> or accidental <b>threat.</b> The effective security management of an Information System initially requires the elaboration of a complete study, which is based on the methodology of Information System Risk Analysis and Management and which follows three main stages, according to the International Organization for Standardization: (a) Identification and valuation of assets, (b) Risk Analysis, which includes the threat assessment and the vulnerability assessment of the Information System and (c) Risk Management, which includes the selection of countermeasures, the determination of the security policy as well as the preparation, implementation and observation of the security plan. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose the effective guidelines that have to apply to all organisations (“participants”) in the new information society and suggest the need for a greater awareness and understanding of security issues and the need to develop a “security policy”...|$|R
40|$|The {{smart grid}} vision implies {{extensive}} use of ICT in the power system, enabling increased flexibility and functionality and thereby meeting future demands and strategic goals. Consequently, power system reliability will increasingly depend on ICT components and systems. While adding functionality, ICT systems also contribute to failures, such as hidden failures in protection systems, as has been exemplified by recent power outages. It also brings new threats, {{such as that of}} cyber-attacks. To ensure effective power system reliability, the interdependencies between power and ICT systems need to be properly understood. This paper provides an overview of main interdependency categories, as well as methods {{that can be used to}} identify and study interdependencies. Based on a study of recent papers in major archival journals, we conclude that appropriate methods for identification of interdependencies between power and ICT systems seem to be lacking. In addition, current methods seem unable to both cover the power system at large, and at the same time take into account the full array of <b>intentional</b> and accidental <b>threats.</b> Based on these findings, we make recommendations for future research in this field...|$|R
40|$|Parrot’s feather, {{a member}} of the water-milfoil family (Haloragaceae), is a {{herbaceous}} aquatic perennial that gets its name from the feather-like appearance of its graygreen leaves. The leaves are arranged around the stem in whorls of four to six, and may be submerged or emergent. Stiff, bright green, emergent leaves are 1 to 2 inches long with 10 to 18 segments per leaf. The stem and leaves can grow up to a foot above the water surface, giving the appearance of small fir trees. The submerged leaves are limp, but the stems are stiff and very vigorous. When attached to a bank, the plant can extend several yards across the water. Male and female flowers are on different plants, but only the female plants have been found in North America. Besides parrot’s feather and another nonnative, Eurasian water-milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), eight native species of Myriophyllum are found in eastern North America. Consult a botanist to confirm identification before initiating any control measures. Habitat Parrot’s feather is a native of the Amazon River and was introduced to North America in the Washington, D. C., area around 1890. However, since its introduction, the plant has spread throughout the southern United States and northward along both coasts. It appears to prefer warmer, milder climates and has spread quickly via plant fragments through waterways and drainage systems and <b>intentional</b> plantings. <b>Threats</b> Because of its appearance and ease of cultivation, parrot’s feather has been used extensively in both indoor and outdoor aquaria and as a popular water garden plant. It has escaped cultivation, however, and while parrot’s feather may provide cover for some aquatic organisms, it can seriously change the physical characteristics of lakes and streams. The shade from dense infestations can alter aquatic ecosystems, and the thick growth can clog irrigation and drainage canals. Many municipalities are spending {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} annually to control parrot’s feather. Flooding, drainage and irrigation problems, and increased mosquito populations are all legacies of this single aquatic plant. Yet it continues to be a challenge to persuade garden centers to remove it from their inventories...|$|R
