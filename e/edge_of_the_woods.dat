25|$|Anderson {{incorporates}} precursor {{texts that}} parallel Melinda's experience. In the story, Melinda's English class studies Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter, which features similar fairy tale imagery. Hester Prynne, an outcast protagonist like Melinda, {{lives in a}} cottage at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> Hester's cottage parallels Melinda's closet. For both women, the seclusion of the forest represents a space beyond social demands. The deciphering of Hawthorne's symbolism mimics the process faced by readers of Melinda's narrative. Similarly, Anderson connects Melinda's trauma to that of Maya Angelou, author of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Melinda places a poster of Angelou in her closet. She admires Angelou because her novel was banned by the school board. Melinda and Angelou were both outcasts. Like Melinda, Angelou was silenced following her childhood rape.|$|E

25|$|Warren found Crawford's {{division}} hesitating at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> on {{the east}} side of Gilliam's field at the same time Custer's division was being held back by Rooney Lee's men to the south and west. The Union soldiers were not heeding officers' orders to move forward against Corse's line of breastworks. After a few minutes for reorganization of the units, Warren took the corps flag and rode into the field with his staff officers and called for the men to follow. The men then rose and followed their officers and color bearers to attack Corse's brigade, capturing many prisoners and dispersing the other Confederates. In the attack, Warren's horse was shot from under him just short of the Confederate line, an orderly was killed and Lieutenant Colonel Hollon Richardson of the 7th Wisconsin Infantry Regiment was badly wounded when he jumped his horse between Warren and the Confederate defenders.|$|E
25|$|Saint-Cyr put his cavalry and {{artillery}} {{in the middle}} of his leading unit and was able to avoid pursuit. His column arrived at Trippstadt as the town was being attacked by Kleist. This lucky accident allowed Saint-Cyr's column to easily brush off Kleist's division and escape. Ambert's column had more trouble. His infantry was supposed to hold the edge of a forest until the cavalry {{and artillery}} of the rear guard reached it. By some error, the foot soldiers continued on their march. The Prussian horsemen routed their adversaries and the defeated French cavalry stampeded through the ranks of their own infantry, causing chaos. Oudinot's battalion, made of sterner stuff, chased off the Prussian cavalry and returned to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> where they recovered some of the abandoned artillery. However, they were unable to drag away the guns because the horse teams had been killed. Continuing the withdrawal, Oudinot's men encountered a Prussian roadblock, but forced their way through. The two retreating columns reassembled at Pirmasens except for some soldiers who fled as far as Bitche. At Kaiserslautern the French lost about 1,000 men killed, wounded or missing in addition to 17 artillery pieces and two colors. Total Prussian casualties were 110 while Saxon losses were unknown but very light.|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{placed the}} 90 men {{of his company}} in {{position}} facing in an arc from west to northeast; the 2nd Platoon took the left flank near the stone wall, the 1st Platoon took the center position on a wooded knoll, and the 3rd Platoon the right flank {{at the edge of}} a woods. Just as he reached the top, Second Lieutenant Thomas T. Jones, commanding the 3rd Platoon, saw and heard three North Korean mortars fire from [...] away on a grassy ridge to the east. He suggested to Kennedy that artillery fire be directed on these mortars, but Kennedy did not act on the suggestion. Kennedy established his command post inside the tunnel behind the 2nd Platoon position. The D Company position was entirely within the area enclosed by the stone wall, which was nearly intact except on the northeast near the 3rd Platoon position where it had crumbled and was covered with brush and trees. Jones pointed out to his platoon sergeant and squad leaders where he wanted them to take position at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> facing the North Korean mortars he had seen on the grassy ridge beyond. He then remained a few minutes in conversation with Kennedy. A few minutes later Jones joined his 3rd Squad men at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> They told him that the platoon sergeant and the rest had continued on toward the narrow grassy ridge. One of the squad members called Jones to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and pointed out 12 well-camouflaged North Korean soldiers, one of them carrying a machine gun, coming down the narrow ridge toward them from the mortar position. This group was a security force for the mortars and they dropped to the ground about one-third of the way down the ridge.|$|E

500|$|During the bombardment, {{the land}} force under Walley {{remained}} inactive, suffering from cold and complaining of shortage of rum. After {{a couple of}} miserable days, they decided to carry the shore positions and try to overcome the French earthworks. They set out on 20 October [...] "in the best European tradition, with drums beating and colors unfurled," [...] {{but there was a}} skirmish at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> The New Englanders could not cope with the maintained heavy Canadian fire, and the brass field guns fired into the woods had no effect. Although Sainte-Hélène was mortally wounded, 150 of the attackers had been killed in action, and were utterly discouraged. They made a retreat in a state of near panic on 22 October, even abandoning five field guns on the shore.|$|E
500|$|While Dilkes {{was moving}} on Ruffin's {{position}} on Barrosa Ridge, Barnard {{and the light}} companies advanced through the woods towards Leval's division. Unaware of the impending British assault, the French had taken no precautions and were advancing in two columns of march, with no forward line of voltigeurs. [...] The unexpected appearance of British skirmishers caused such confusion that some French regiments, thinking there were cavalry present, formed square. [...] These were prime targets for shrapnel rounds fired by the ten cannon under Major Duncan which, having made rapid progress through the woods, arrived in time to support the skirmish line. As the situation became clearer, the French organised themselves into their customary attacking formation—the 'column of divisions'—all the time under fire from Barnard's light companies and Duncan's artillery. [...] Finally, with the French now in their fighting columns and beginning their advance, Barnard was forced to draw back. [...] Leval's men then encountered Bushe's companies of the 20th Portuguese, who supported the light battalion's retreat and kept the French engaged until Wheatley's brigade had formed up in line on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> The retreating light companies joined Wheatley's troops; Leval's division of 3,800 men was now marching on an Anglo-Portuguese line of 1,400 men supported by cannon.|$|E
500|$|Some of the Americans, led by Thompson, {{made their}} way out of the swamp to be confronted by HMS Martin, which drove them back into the swamp with grapeshot. [...] A column of men under Colonel Anthony Wayne fared only a little better, {{arriving}} out of the swamp only to face Fraser's formation. A brief exchange of fire took place: but the Americans, clearly outmatched by Fraser's forces, broke and ran, leaving arms and supplies behind. Portions of the American force retreated to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> which gave them some cover, and attempted to engage some of the British troops: but fire from those troops kept them off the road and fire from some of the ships in the river kept them from the shore. [...] St. Clair and a number of men made it back to the landing site, only to find it occupied by the British troops. Only by returning to the swampy woods and continuing to flee upriver did these men escape capture at that time. [...] Wayne eventually managed to form a rear guard of about 800 men, which attempted an attack on the British position; but they were driven back into the woods. Wayne then led a staggered retreat, in which companies of men slipped away, with the woods giving cover to hide their true numbers.|$|E

2500|$|Just before 11 on {{the night}} of August 8, 1898, Lt. Atwater thought he saw moving figures in white, on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> 250 yards from the lighthouse. At 1145, with {{moonlight}} breaking through the clouds, he saw several men in the brush on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> Without giving an alarm, he instructed the lookouts to be on heightened vigilance. As he was heading to the yard gate to order the corporal of the guard and sentry to come inside the light-house, those men came running up and announced they had seen Spanish troops in the road. Almost immediately, a volley of gunfire erupted from the surrounding woods. [...] Atwater ordered the lighthouse lamp doused as a signal to the three armed ships lying offshore that the light-house was under attack. The cruiser, , the only ship with an operable searchlight, trained it on the hill where the lighthouse sat in order to direct secondary battery gunfire from Cincinnati, Amphitrite and Leyden on the attacking Spanish troops.|$|E
2500|$|As Ayres's men crossed White Oak Road, {{they ran}} into Mackenzie's {{approaching}} cavalry. Sheridan had ordered Mackenzie to strike toward Hatcher's Run, turn west and occupy Ford's Road, covering the V Corps' right flank. Warren soon realized that the V Corps had crossed White Oak Road east of {{the left of the}} Confederate line and Crawford's division was starting to diverge from Ayres's. Warren thought that the Confederate line must be in the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> about [...] from the road and continued to lead the corps toward the northwest.|$|E

2500|$|Seeing {{this force}} approach, Bennigsen wheeled back his main line {{to face the}} wood, thus {{reducing}} the artillery fire directed at Lannes's units. [...] Barclay, finding Fournier attacking his right flank, fell back {{to the right of}} the main Russian line. [...] Bennigsen reinforced him with two infantry regiments and some cavalry, and directed an artillery battery to fire on the wood. [...] Thus reinforced Barclay attacked the wood. [...] The French were driven out, and Fournier's right flank exposed. [...] This was attacked by twenty squadrons of Russian cavalry, but the 85th French Infantry Regiment formed squares and by a steady fire drove the cavalry off. [...] At about 8:00 PM the combat died away, and Fournier retired to the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion {{was ordered}} to seize and hold the central area on the western <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods,</b> {{where there was a}} main road running north from the Wesel to Emmerich, and to a number of houses. It was {{believed}} this area was held by German paratroopers. [...] "C" [...] Company would clear {{the northern part of the}} woods near the junction of the roads to Rees and Emmerich. Once this area was secure, [...] "A" [...] Company would advance through the position and seize the houses located near the DZ. [...] "B" [...] Company would clear the South-Western part of the woods and secure the battalion's flank. Despite some of the paratroopers being dropped some distance from their landing zone, the Battalion managed to secure its objectives quickly. The battalion lost its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Nicklin, who was killed during the initial jump on 24 March 1945. Following the death of Nicklin, the last unit commander was Lt. Col. G.F. Eadie until the Battalion's disbandment.|$|E
2500|$|Colonel Randal McGavock, 10th Tennessee Infantry, {{commanding}} the consolidated 10th/30th Tennessee, sent a courier to find General Gregg. [...] The courier returned, not with orders from General Gregg, but with {{news that the}} Confederate center had been routed. [...] In a panic, McGavock ordered his regiment to the center without pausing to inform the 50th Tennessee now protecting the Confederate left flank. Marching double time by the right flank back to the position he had occupied earlier that morning, McGavock emerged from the woods {{in time to see}} scattered groups of Confederates being pursued by a wave of blue. [...] Before all his troops had even emerged from the woods, McGavock ordered an oblique charge by his own 10th Tennessee [...] "Sons of Erin," [...] some seven companies, across the open field into the midst of the blue mass. [...] What McGavock failed to realize was that the field was now enfiladed by the 31st Illinois, lying hidden in the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> along the creek. [...] In a dramatic flourish, McGavock threw back his cape, exposing the red liner and inspiring his fellow Irishmen as he led the counterattack. [...] Unfortunately for the 10th TN, this also made McGavock a fine target and he was shot almost immediately. [...] The 31st Illinois [...] "opened fire as if by file" [...] as the Irish Southerners charged across their front, successfully forcing the Federal pursuers of the Confederate center to return to the shelter of the creek. [...] The success came at a cost: the 10th Tennessee suffered a majority of its 88 reported casualties in this action.|$|E

2500|$|More {{orders were}} {{received}} at 3pm {{to move to}} Varesnes on the south bank of the River Oise but whilst en-route they were countermanded with surprise orders to counter attack and retake a village called Babouef. Therefore, the war worn Brigade who had been fighting and marching for four punishing days solid were about faced and moved off to the attack with an enthusiasm that {{is nothing short of}} incredible. By rights, the Brigade should have been incapable of the action yet those quoted as being there remark that it was the most memorable event of the entire rearguard action. At 5pm, with the Fusiliers on the right, the Bedfords on the left and the Northamptons in reserve, the Brigade formed up with the Babouef to Compeigne road on their right and the southern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> above Babouef to their left. The Germans had not expected a British counter attack, thinking there was nothing but ragged French units in their area, so were surprised at the arrival of three small but determined British battalions. They put little fight up and many Germans fell in the hand to hand fighting that lasted for around [...] before the village was secured and the remaining enemy – that could get away – fled. Ten machine guns and [...] prisoners were taken with very light casualties recorded by the Brigade; an incredible feat whatever way you view it. They dug in on the German side of the village amongst the cornfields and settled in for the night. Cooking limbers were even brought up and the idea of a quiet night gave the exhausted men a welcomed break from the extreme stress they had all been through in the past five days. Unfortunately, their rest did not last long.|$|E
