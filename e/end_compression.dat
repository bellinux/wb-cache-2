40|$|The {{deformation}} of two sheet-stringer panels subjected to <b>end</b> <b>compression</b> under carefully controlled end conditions was measured {{at a number}} of points and {{at a number of}} loads, most of which were above the load at which the sheet had begun to buckle. The two panels were identical except for the sheet, which was 0. 70 -inch 24 st alclad for specimen 1 and 0. 025 -inch 24 st aluminum alloy for specimen 6. A technique was developed for attaching Tuckerman optical strain gauges to the sheet without disturbing the strain distribution in the sheet by the method of attachment. This technique was used to explore the strain distribution in the sheet at various loads. The twisting and the bending of the stringers was measured by means of pointers attached to the stringers. The shape of the buckles in the sheet of specimen 6 was recorded at two loads by means of plaster casts. The sheet and the stringer loads at failure are compared with the corresponding loads for five similar panels tested at the Navy Model Basin. A detailed comparison is made between the measured {{deformation of}} the buckled sheet and the deformation calculated from approximate theories for the deformation in a rectangular sheet with freely supported edges buckling under <b>end</b> <b>compression</b> advanced by Timoshenko, Frankland, and Marguerre. The measured effective width for the specimens is compared with the effective width given by nine different relations for effective width {{as a function of the}} edge stress divided by the buckling stress of the sheet. The analysis of the measured stringer deformation is confined to an application of Southwell's method of plotting deformation against deformation over load.

To this <b>end,</b> <b>compression</b> tests in a direction perpendicular to the fibers were carried out inside a scanning electron microscope and secondary electron images obtained at different magnifications during the test. Optimum DIC parameters to resolve the displacement and strain field were computed from numerical simulations of a model composite and they were applied to micrographs obtained at different magnifications (250 _, 2000 _, and 6000 _). It is shown that DIC of low-magnification micrographs was able to capture the long range fluctuations in strain due {{to the presence of}} matrix-rich and fiber-rich zones, responsible for the onset of damage. At higher magnification, the strain fields obtained with DIC qualitatively reproduce the non-homogeneous deformation pattern due to the presence of stiff fibers dispersed in a compliant matrix and provide accurate results of the average composite strain.

40|$|A rectangular, variable-stiffness {{panel with}} tow {{overlaps}} was manufactured using an advanced tow placement machine. The cured panel had large anticlastic imperfections, with measured amplitudes of over two times the average panel thickness. These imperfections were {{not due to}} the overall steered-fiber layup or the tow overlaps, but instead resulted from local asymmetries in the laminate that were caused by a manufacturing oversight. In the nominal panel layup, fiber angles vary linearly from 60 degrees on the panel axial centerline to 30 degrees on the parallel edges. A geometrically nonlinear analysis was performed with a - 280 degree Fahrenheit thermal load to simulate the postcure cooldown to room temperature. The predicted geometric imperfections correlated well with the measured panel shape. Unique structural test fixtures were then developed which greatly reduced these imperfections, but they also caused prestresses in the panel. Surface imperfections measured after the panel was installed in the test fixtures were used with nonlinear finite element analyses to predict these fixturing-induced prestresses. These prestresses were also included in structural analyses of panel <b>end</b> <b>compression</b> to failure, and the analytical results compared well with test data when both geometric and material nonlinearities were included...|$|E

The test panels in the study consist of superplastically formed titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V half-hat elements that are joined by weld-brazing to titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V caps to form either single-corrugation compression panels or multiple-corrugation compression panels. Stretching and subsequent thinning of the titanium sheet during superplastic forming is reduced by approximately 35 percent with a shallow half-hat die concept instead of a deep die concept and results in a more uniform thickness across the beaded webs. The complete panels are tested in <b>end</b> <b>compression</b> at room temperature and the results compared with analysis. The heavily loaded panels failed at loads approaching the yield strength of the titanium material.
