500|$|At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge's Division was {{assigned}} to Lieutenant General William J. Hardee's Corps and was stationed {{on the east side}} of the Stones River. When the Union Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Major General William Rosecrans, attacked on December 31, 1862, beginning the Battle of Stones River, Bragg's main force initially repelled the attack. Bragg ordered Breckinridge to reinforce him on the west side of the river, but Brigadier General John Pegram, who commanded a Cavalry brigade, erroneously reported that a large Union force was advancing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was slow to comply with Bragg's order. When he finally crossed the river, his attacks were ineffective, and Bragg ordered him back across the river. By January 2, Union forces had taken a ridge that ran along the river; against Breckinridge's advice, Bragg ordered the 2nd Division to launch a near-suicidal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, [...] "if [...] should result in disaster and I be among the killed, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> justice to my memory and tell the people that I believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it." ...|$|E
500|$|Disney then {{assigned}} Larry Clemmons as his new {{writer and}} one of the four story men for the film, giving Clemmons a copy of Kipling's book, and telling him: [...] "The first thing <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is not to read it." [...] Clemmons still looked at the novel, and thought it was too disjointed and without continuity, needing adaptations to fit a film script. Clemmons wanted to start in medias res, with some flashbacks afterwards, but then Disney said to focus on doing the storyline more straight - [...] "Let's do the meat of the picture. Let's establish the characters. Let's have fun with it.". Although much of Bill Peet's work was discarded, the personalities of the characters remained in the final film. This was because Disney felt that the story should be kept simple, and the characters should drive the story. Disney took {{an active role in the}} story meetings, acting out each role and helping to explore the emotions of the characters, help create gags and develop emotional sequences. Clemmons would write a rough script with an outline for most sequences. The story artists then discussed how to fill the scenes, including the comedic gags to employ. The script also tried to incorporate how the voice actors molded their characters and interacted with each other. The Jungle Book also marks the last animated film from the company to have Disney's personal touches, before his death on December 15, 1966.|$|E

You’ve {{been doing this}} your whole life.' He inspired me. He’s been able to have these conversations with me since the mid ’80s. He pushed me to start writing Little Earthquakes, so he’s been in my life for so long. (Before July of last year), I hadn’t seen him for 14 years. And even though he’s 70, he’s as sharp as he ever was.|$|E

2500|$|A {{technique}} {{attributed to}} Sigmund Freud {{to help in}} making difficult decisions is to toss a coin not actually to determine the decision, but to clarify the decision-maker's feelings. He explained: [...] "I did not say you should follow blindly what the coin tells you. What <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> is to note what the coin indicates. Then look into your own reactions. Ask yourself: Am I pleased? Am I disappointed? That will help you to recognize how you really feel about the matter, deep down inside. With that as a basis, you'll then be ready to {{make up your mind}} and come to the right decision." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rihanna {{possesses}} a mezzo-soprano vocal range of three octaves and two notes. While recording tracks for her third studio album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna took vocal lessons from Ne-Yo. Speaking {{of the experience}} she stated, [...] "I've never had vocal training, so when I'm in the studio, he'll {{tell me how to}} breathe and stuff... He'll call out these big fancy words: 'OK, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> staccato.' And I'm like, 'OK, I don't know what that is.'" [...] Her vocal performance on Loud (2010) received positive reviews from music critics. James Skinner from BBC praised Rihanna's vocals on the song [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] and wrote that her voice is powerful and that [...] "it is Rihanna's vocal– at once commanding, soulful and vulnerable– that anchors the song, and Loud itself". Andy Gill from The Independent feels that [...] "California King Bed" [...] features her best vocal performance. In a review of Unapologetic, Billboard magazine wrote, [...] "Diamonds finds Rihanna doing one of her throatiest, most impassioned vocals to date, on this inspirational pop ballad." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times stated, [...] "over the years, as her game face froze in place, her voice cured into a weapon of emotional chill and strategic indifference. It's decidedly unfriendly, made to give orders".|$|E
2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} me to come to his private office. [...] Wondering what he would want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
