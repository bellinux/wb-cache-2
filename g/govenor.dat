40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to clarify the}} process of judicial selection of the courts of general jurisdiction at regions and districts in Russian Federation. It is focused to {{the conflict between the}} autonomy of the judicial community and the external control on this process of judicial selection. Especially it is investigated to the relation between Judicial Qualifications Collegia of judges at regions and chairpersons of courts at regions or districts, and the conflict between Federation and federation subjects. This article is composed with the following three parts. The first part is concerned with the relation between the establishment of the judicial self-government and the interference of district powers at the Yeltsin administration period. The second part is concerned with the relation between the revision of the judicial self-government and the strengthening of President power at the Putin administration period. The third part is concerned with the process of judicial selection by Examination Committees, Judicial Qualifications Collegia and President Administration. In conclusion it is pointed out that on the process of judicial selection of the courts of general jurisdiction, the self-control of the judicial community is inicially respected, but gradually the influence of President power is strengthened, and the unofficial influence of <b>govenors</b> at regions and chairpersons of courts at regions or districts is still remainig...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{contribution}} towards legal history of Roman Asia Minor from {{the creation of}} the province of Asia to the enfranchisement of the free population of the Empire by the emperor Caracalla. Chapter I is concerned with the Hellenistic background and with the theoretical framework for explaining the relationship between the suzerain and the cities in the Hellenistic and Roman periods. The possibility of using Bickerman’s ‘surrender and grant’ model for introducing much needed nuance into usual dichotomy of ‘free’ and ‘subject’ cities is argued for. Chapter II deals with the court of the Roman governor. It is argued that there was no limit set on <b>govenor’s</b> jurisdiction from below and that the main way in which governor’s burden was relieved or legal autonomy of local communities guaranteed was through delegation of decision at the apud iudicem stage of the proceeedings. An in-depth study of the procedure is provided. Chapter III provides an analysis of the assize circuit system, above all in the province of Asia. Arguments for continuity with the pre-Roman administrative structure are advanced and a new hypothesis of significant structural changes in the second century A. D. advanced. Chapter IV explores the jurisdiction of other Roman officials: proconsular legates, quaestors, and above all procurators and other imperial officials. The division of responsibility with the governor’s court and their role in covering the areas not usually penetrated by the governor’s jurisdiction is discussed. Chapter V deals with judicial autonomy of the ‘free’ and ‘federate’ cities. It is argued that the extent of these privileges was widely variant and the possibility that some of them applied only to the apud iudicem stage explored. Chapter VI is concerned with courts of the ‘subject’ communities. It is suggested on the basis of recently published evidence that ‘subject’ communities could retain a high degree of judicial autonomy. Different models used by the Romans are explored and compared. Chapter VII explores a vexed question of internal jurisdiction of Jewish diaspora communities in Asia Minor. The validity of Flavius Josephus' evidence is upheld and the role of 'ancestral laws' ideology in Roman interventions in support of Jewish courts discussed. Two appendices discuss a recently published inscription from Chersonesus Taurica and offer an annotated list of passages in the Corpus iuris civilis dealing with Asia Minor in our period respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is twofold. Firstly it is to examine the {{response}} to school inspection conducted by teacher 2 ̆ 7 s organisations, especially by the National Union of Teachers (NUT), thereby receiving to its rsearch reports. Secondly it aims to give consideration to the role of such an organisationunder the school evaluation system, hereby including school-self evaluation and school inspection. In 1992 a new school inspection system by the Office for Standard in Education (OFSTED) was introduced to England. Before this system, the school inspection had been conducted by Her Majesty 2 ̆ 7 s Inspector (HMI). Teacher 2 ̆ 7 s crganisations had evaluated this system as helpful and important for developing teachers 2 ̆ 7 professional motivation. The response to OFSTED school inspection by NUT, however, is very negative. It seems that schools and teachers are being divided into 2 ̆ 7 good 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 failed 2 ̆ 7 by the OFSTED inspection, especially by the classroom observation under the OFSTED 2 ̆ 7 s limited framework, which has had a big impact. Not only the teachers labeled as 2 ̆ 7 failed 2 ̆ 7 are gradually losing their self confidence and professional motivation. NUT emphasises school self-evaluation as a strategy against OFSTED 2 ̆ 7 s dominant school inspection in order to consider differences betweene schools and to encourage teacher 2 ̆ 7 s professional motivation. It 2 ̆ 7 s framework respects school own specific circumstances and its indicators are generated and developed by people directly involved, such as pupils, students, teachers, parents, and <b>govenors.</b> But OFSTED has introduced its framework of self-school inspection m 1999 and is trying to make schools use this self-school inspection criteria as their school self-evaluationcriteria. This will make it impossible for schools to use their own self-evaluation criteria and gives OFSTED 2 ̆ 7 s inspection system more and more authority. The role of teacher 2 ̆ 7 s organisatoins is to continue the empirical research for school self-evaluation to ensure its effect for school improvement and to support teachers who are facing problems in their job. Moreover, it is to continue developing and examining a school self-evaluation framework which is useful to examine OFSTED inspection objectively...|$|R
