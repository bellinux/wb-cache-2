The club {{were in the}} middle of a financial crisis, which had seen the board sell the Goldstone Ground <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> afloat; on the pitch the club were facing a battle for their league status. His first full season as manager was a matter of consolidation as the club finished a respectable 11th, whilst Adams signed talent such as star striker Bobby Zamora. The £100,000 spent on Zamora was the only transfer outlay Adams made in building his squad.|$|E
25|$|Insects {{generally}} {{have a higher}} food conversion efficiency than more traditional meats, measured as efficiency of conversion of ingested food, or ECI. While many insects can have an energy input to protein output ratio of around 4:1, raised livestock has a ratio closer to 54:1. This is partially {{due to the fact}} that feed first needs to be grown for most traditional livestock. Additionally endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates need to use a significantly greater amount of energy <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> warm whereas ectothermic (cold blooded) plants or insects do not. An index which can be used as a measure is the Efficiency of conversion of ingested food to body substance: for example, only 10% of ingested food is converted to body substance by beef cattle, versus 19–31% by silkworms and 44% by German cockroaches. Studies concerning the house cricket (Acheta domesticus) provide further evidence for the efficiency of insects as a food source. When reared at 30°C or more and fed a diet of equal quality to the diet used to rear conventional livestock, crickets showed a food conversion twice as efficient as pigs and broiler chicks, four times that of sheep, and six times higher than steers (oxen) when losses in carcass trim and dressing percentage are counted.|$|E
25|$|After {{the bike}} shop closes, Mark decides {{to move to}} Minnesota. Becky decides to go with him, and they elope. Jackie and Roseanne each get a check for $10,000 from their mother after she and their father divorce. They, along with Nancy, decide to open a diner but can only get the money they need after Bev agrees to become a partner as well. Nancy comes out as a lesbian. The Tildens, a single father and his two daughters around Becky and Darlene's ages (Wings Hauser, Mara Hobel, Danielle Harris), move in next door. Jackie dates Fisher (Matt Roth), a much younger man. When Roseanne discovers he is {{physically}} abusive, Dan confronts him, beats him up, and is arrested. Roseanne and Jackie's father dies, and Roseanne confronts his longtime secret mistress only to find her father blamed his daughters for his abuse towards them. Roseanne's rich, estranged cousin Ronnie (Joan Collins) visits and persuades Darlene to get her GED and apply to art school. David applies as well. Darlene asks her parents if David can move in, because his mother is moving away {{and they want to}} stay together. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne sees David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive, she decides to let him stay because it reminded her of her own troubled childhood with her equally abusive father. Roger (Tim Curry) offers Dan a deal to renovate and sell a small fixer-upper house, then runs off before the deal is complete; Jackie decides to buy the house, saving Dan from financial ruin. David gets a rejection letter from art school, while Darlene gets an acceptance. At the end of the season, Roseanne fears Darlene will run away to school, although Darlene has already decided not to go. Realizing she was wrong, Roseanne persuades Darlene to not give up on her goals <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> with David.|$|E

In {{the early years of}} her marriage to fellow actor Adam Smethurst the couple struggled financially, and with the added expense of the birth of their daughter, Ayola had been on the verge of giving up her acting career to begin a business franchise. [...] On joining the cast of Holby City, she disclosed: [...] "I've been someone who's loved the uncertainty of acting. I've loved that one month it's Sahara in Morocco and the next I'm doing a stage play, then it's a six-part telly thing.

So, maybe it'll only sell a million singles and reach No. 2", giving the song three-and-a-half stars. Daryl Addison of Great American Country praised the song, saying that [...] "even with heavy thematic elements, the songs impressively maintain a pop/crossover shine and accessible sound, courtesy of Carrie's pristine voice and modern delivery." [...] Writing for Country Universe, Kevin Coyne gave the song an A, complimenting the singer's versatility, saying that [...] "it's a credit to her ambition as an artist.

The song contains ambient beats, {{bass and}} percussion and a poetic spoken word vocal with high loop.

It continues with a person incorrectly pronouncing her name as [...] "'Bee Awnz' [...] Knowles". According to Spin columnist Brandon Soderberg, the song begins with a [...] "random, frustrating indignity from her youth into a full-blown, racially loaded origin story" [...] and also features expressions of her celebrity. Lyrically, Beyoncé makes a prediction about her album's sales and offers commentary on record labels through a spoken word intro: [...] "I don't trust these record labels, I'm tourin'" [...] and later adds, [...] "Soul not for sale/Probably won't make no money off this/Oh well." [...] Speaking about the record industry, she sings about being bored with labels during the lines, [...] "All the shit I do is boring / All these record labels... boring".

500|$|Drogba is {{credited}} with playing {{a vital role in}} bringing peace to his country. After the Ivory Coast qualified for the 2006 World Cup, Drogba made a desperate plea to the combatants, asking them to lay down their arms, a plea which was answered with a cease fire after five years of civil war. Drogba later helped move an African Cup of Nations qualifier to the rebel stronghold of Bouake; a move that helped confirm the peace process. On 24 January 2007, Drogba was appointed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as a Goodwill Ambassador. The UNDP were impressed with his previous charity work and believed that his high-profile would help raise awareness on African issues. In September 2011, Drogba joined the Truth, Reconciliation and Dialogue Commission as a representative to help return peace to his home nation. His involvement in the peace process led to Drogba being named as one of the world's 100 most influential people by Time magazine for 2010. Drogba's charity work continued when, in late 2009, he announced he would be donating the £3million signing on fee for his endorsement of Pepsi {{for the construction of a}} hospital in his hometown of Abidjan. This work was done through Drogba's recently created [...] "Didier Drogba Foundation" [...] and Chelsea announced they too would donate the fee for the deal toward the Foundation's project.

Cosmopolitan Alex Rees said the song is a [...] "sharp critique of postmodern culture, except {{then all of a}} sudden there's a bunch of nasty sex talk." [...] Mesfin Fekadu from the Associated Press described [...] "Haunted" [...] as a [...] "gloomy" [...] song. Writing for the website The 405, editor White Caitlin felt the singer offered part of her insecurities and flaws through the song and [...] "sheds slut-shaming, the shackled role of uptight matriarch or calculated star". Facts Chris Kelly described its composition as [...] "foreboding" [...] and found a [...] "seductive" [...] and [...] "haunting" [...] hook; he further described the first part as [...] "smoky ethereality". Mojos Priya Elan felt that some of the lines were a [...] "nihilistic streak". In a review for The Quietus, Mof Gimmers described [...] "Haunted" [...] as a [...] "perfect slice of vanguard-pop". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune described it as a [...] "two-part dream". Robert Leedham of the website Drowned in Sound felt that the album's [...] "confessional moments are when you connect with it the most", exemplifying the statement with lyrics from [...] "Haunted".
