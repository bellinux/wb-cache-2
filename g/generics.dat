5|$|In June 2005, ECMA {{approved}} edition 3 of the C# specification, {{and updated}} ECMA-334. Additions included partial classes, anonymous methods, nullable types, and <b>generics</b> (somewhat similar to C++ templates).|$|E
25|$|Large {{pharmaceutical}} companies often spend {{millions of dollars}} protecting their patents from generic competition. Apart from litigation, they may reformulate a drug or license a subsidiary (or another company) to sell <b>generics</b> under the original patent. <b>Generics</b> sold under license from the patent holder are known as authorized <b>generics.</b>|$|E
25|$|No <b>generics</b> are {{available}} for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (Januvia, Onglyza) and other combinations.|$|E
25|$|When <b>generics</b> {{were added}} to Java 5.0, there was already a large {{framework}} of classes (many of which were already deprecated), so <b>generics</b> were chosen to be implemented using erasure to allow for migration compatibility and re-use of these existing classes. This limited the features that {{could be provided by}} this addition as compared to some other languages. The addition of type wildcards made Java unsound.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the new Pfizer made Greenstone (originally {{established}} as a division of Upjohn) its generic division, and its focus turned to selling authorized <b>generics</b> of Pfizer's products.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{as chair}} of the Senate's {{subcommittee}} on patents, he helped extend patents for several drugs, most significantly the allergy medication Claritin, to prevent the marketing of less-expensive <b>generics.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 1 April 2013, it was {{announced}} that the Indian court invalidated Novartis's patent on Gleevec. This decision makes the drug available via <b>generics</b> on the Indian market at a considerably lower price.|$|E
25|$|J2SE 5.0 (September 30, 2004) – Codename Tiger. It was {{originally}} numbered 1.5, {{which is still}} used as the internal version number. Developed under JSR 176, Tiger added several significant new language features including the for-each loop, <b>generics,</b> autoboxing and var-args.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer's patents on Viagra expired {{outside the}} US in 2012; in the US {{they were set}} to expire, but Pfizer settled {{litigation}} with each of Mylan and Teva which agreed that both companies could introduce <b>generics</b> in the US in December 2017.|$|E
25|$|Methylphenidate was {{originally}} available as an immediate-release racemic mixture formulation under the Novartis trademark name Ritalin, although {{a variety of}} <b>generics</b> are now available, some under other brand names. Generic brand names include Ritalina, Rilatine, Attenta, Medikinet, Metadate, Methylin, Penid, Tranquilyn, and Rubifen.|$|E
25|$|In May 2010, the GCC {{steering}} committee decided to allow {{use of a}} C++ compiler to compile GCC. The compiler {{was intended to be}} written in C plus a subset of features from C++. In particular, this was decided so that GCC's developers could use the destructors and <b>generics</b> features of C++.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to marketing branded pharmaceuticals, Pfizer {{is involved in}} the manufacture and sale of <b>generics.</b> In the US it does this through its Greenstone subsidiary, which it acquired as part of the acquisition of Pharmacia. Pfizer also has a licensing deal in place with Aurobindo, which grants the former access to a variety of oral solid generic products.|$|E
25|$|The European Federation of Neurological Societies {{recommends}} pregabalin as a {{first line}} agent {{for the treatment of}} pain associated with diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain. A minority obtain substantial benefit, and a larger number obtain moderate benefit. Other first line agents, including gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressants, are given equal weight as first line agents, and unlike pregabalin, are available as less expensive <b>generics.</b>|$|E
25|$|As of 2008, all Java ME {{platforms}} {{are currently}} restricted to JRE 1.3 features {{and use that}} version of the class file format (internally known as version 47.0). Should Oracle ever declare {{a new round of}} Java ME configuration versions that support the later class file formats and language features, such as those corresponding to JRE 1.5 or 1.6 (notably, <b>generics),</b> it will entail extra work on the part of all platform vendors to update their JREs.|$|E
25|$|In ObjC, {{and most}} other {{languages}} implementing the protocol concept, {{it is up to}} the programmer to ensure that the required methods are implemented in each class. Swift adds the ability to add these methods using extensions, and to use generic programming (<b>generics)</b> to implement them. Combined, these allow protocols to be written once and support a wide variety of instances. Also, the extension mechanism can be used to add protocol conformance to an object that does not list that protocol in its definition.|$|E
25|$|Bioequivalence {{does not}} mean generic drugs must be {{exactly the same as}} the brand-name product ("pharmaceutical equivalent"). Chemical {{differences}} may exist; a different salt or estermay be used, for instance. However, the therapeutic effect of the drug must be the same ("pharmaceutical alternative"). Most small molecule drugs are accepted as bioequivalent if their pharmacokinetic parameters of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) are within a 90% confidence interval of 80–125%; most approved <b>generics</b> are well within this limit. For more complex products—such as inhalers, patch delivery systems, liposomal preparations, or biosimilar drugs—demonstrating pharmacodynamic or clinical equivalence is more challenging.|$|E
25|$|In March 2001, 40 multi-national {{pharmaceutical}} companies brought litigation against South Africa for its Medicines Act, which allowed the generic production of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for treating HIV, {{despite the fact}} that these drugs were on-patent. HIV was and is an epidemic in South Africa, and ARVs at the time cost between 10,000 and 15,000 USD per patient per year. This was unaffordable for most South African citizens, and so the South African government committed to providing ARVs at prices closer to what people could afford. To do so, they would need to ignore the patents on drugs and produce <b>generics</b> within the country (using a compulsory license), or import them from abroad. After international protest in favour of public health rights (including the collection of 250,000 signatures by MSF), the governments of several developed countries (including The Netherlands, Germany, France, and later the US) backed the South African government, and the case was dropped in April of that year.|$|E
25|$|Flutamide, another {{frequently}} used antiandrogen which is nonsteroidal and a pure androgen blocker, though much less potent by weight and binding affinity than either spironolactone or cyproterone acetate, {{has been found}} to be more effective than either of them as an antiandrogen when it is used at the typical treatment doses. Unfortunately, the uses of both cyproterone acetate and flutamide have been associated with hepatotoxicity, which can be severe with flutamide and has resulted in cyproterone acetate never being approved in the United States. Bicalutamide is a more potent, safer, and more tolerable alternative to flutamide, but is relatively little-studied in the treatment of androgen-dependent conditions aside from prostate cancer, though it has been used to treat hirsutism with success. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues are another very effective option for antiandrogen therapy, but have not been widely employed for this purpose due to their high cost and limited insurance coverage despite many now being available as <b>generics.</b> As such, spironolactone may be the only practical, safe, available, and well-supported antiandrogen option in some cases.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the release}} of C# 2.0 in November 2005, the C# and Java {{languages}} have evolved on increasingly divergent trajectories, becoming somewhat less similar. One of the first major departures came {{with the addition of}} <b>generics</b> to both languages, with vastly different implementations. C# makes use of reification to provide [...] "first-class" [...] generic objects that can be used like any other class, with code generation performed at class-load time.|$|E
500|$|Linezolid is marketed by Pfizer {{under the}} trade names Zyvox (in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, {{and several other}} countries), Zyvoxid (in Europe), and Zyvoxam (in Canada and Mexico). <b>Generics</b> are also available, such as Lenzomore (in India, by Morepen), Linospan (in India, by Cipla), Nezocin (in Pakistan, by Brookes), voxazoldin (in Egypt, by Rotabiogen), Lizomed (in India, as a dry syrup by Aglowmed), [...] and Linzolid (in Bangladesh, by Incepta).|$|E
500|$|... "Sing" [...] {{incorporates}} the South African activist song [...] "Jikelele", which translates into [...] "global treatment". Developed by The <b>Generics,</b> [...] "Jikelele" [...] {{was used as}} theme for Prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs across South Africa. After writing it, Lennox wanted to ask other renowned artists to contribute vocals to the song. She wrote a generic letter to many and waited for a response. Although some of the artists were not available, many answered in the affirmative, and ultimately 23 singers were enlisted.|$|E
500|$|Lennox was {{ultimately}} inspired to develop [...] "Sing" [...] based on Achmat's activism {{on behalf of}} HIV and AIDS afflicted people. A group of activists called The <b>Generics</b> {{had given her a}} CD of music, and Lennox combined her inspiration and one of the songs from the CD to compose [...] "Sing". It ultimately became a collaboration between Lennox and 23 prominent female singers. Afterwards, it was included on Lennox's fourth solo studio album, Songs of Mass Destruction (2007). [...] "Sing" [...] was released as the second single from the album for digital download on 1 December 2007.|$|E
500|$|... "Sing" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Scottish singer Annie Lennox for her fourth solo studio album, Songs of Mass Destruction (2007). It was released as the second single from the album on 1 December 2007 by RCA Records. Lennox was inspired to write the track after seeing South African activist Zackie Achmat at Nelson Mandela's 46664 HIV/AIDS concert. She wanted the track {{to be a source}} of empowerment for people without a voice of their own. It also gave rise to her SING Campaign which aimed to raise funds and awareness for issues surrounding HIV/AIDS. [...] "Sing" [...] was produced by Glen Ballard and interpolates the South African tune [...] "Jikelele"; the music was given to Lennox by an activist group called The <b>Generics.</b>|$|E
500|$|Total Films review {{gave the}} film 4/5 with its verdict: [...] "The Terminator story recharges with a post-apocalyptic jolt of energy. Frantic {{and full of}} welcome ties to the past, it also ploughs new ground with purpose. Fingers crossed McG will follow Cameron's lead and serve up a worthy sequel." [...] Devin Faraci of Empire {{magazine}} also gave a positive rating of {{four out of five}} stars, saying: [...] "McG has sparked a moribund franchise back to life, giving fans the post-apocalyptic action they've been craving since they first saw a metal foot crush a human skull two decades ago." [...] However, on CHUD, the latter said, [...] "Bale's desire to star as John Connor was probably the most fatal blow to the film; it completely distorted the shape of the story as it existed." [...] Furthermore, he expressed that the third act was when the film began falling apart, saying, [...] "McG and Nolan muddied the end of the picture, delivering action <b>generics</b> (yet another Terminator fight in a factory) while never finding their own hook that would give this movie more of an impact than you would get from an expanded universe novel." [...] In contrast, James Berardinelli considered the ending {{the best part of the}} film, feeling that the first two-thirds were [...] "rambling and disjointed" [...] and that the lack of a central villain was only fixed when the T-800 appeared.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike <b>generics</b> in Java, [...]NET <b>generics</b> use reification to make {{parameterized}} types first-class {{objects in}} the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) Virtual Machine, which allows for optimizations and preservation of the type information.|$|E
2500|$|Many anti-diabetes {{drugs are}} {{available}} as <b>generics.</b> These include: ...|$|E
2500|$|United States [...] Depakote and Depakote ER (extended release) by Abbott Laboratories and <b>generics</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|United Kingdom [...] Depakote (for {{psychiatric}} conditions) and Epilim (for epilepsy) by Sanofi-Aventis and <b>generics</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|When Prilosec's U.S. patent {{expired in}} April 2001, AstraZeneca {{introduced}} esomeprazole (Nexium) as a patented replacement drug. [...] Many companies introduced <b>generics</b> as AstraZeneca's patents expired worldwide, {{which are available}} under many brand names.|$|E
2500|$|Altimesh Hybridizer {{created by}} Altimesh compiles Common Intermediate Language to CUDA binaries. It {{supports}} <b>generics</b> and virtual functions. Debugging and profiling is integrated to [...] and [...] It's {{available as a}} Visual Studio Extension on [...]|$|E
2500|$|On September 24, 2010, Guernsey's {{auctioned}} a 4lb, 5.4 oz resin falcon for $305,000 to a {{group of}} buyers that included actor Leonardo DiCaprio and billionaire Stewart Rahr, owner of pharmaceutical and <b>generics</b> wholesaler Kinray. [...] The prop was discovered at a flea market in New Jersey in 1991 by Emmy-winning producer/director Ara Chekmayan.|$|E
2500|$|A typical moving light {{allows the}} {{designer}} {{to control the}} position, color, shape, and strobing of the light beam created. [...] This {{can be used for}} exciting effects for the entertainment or dancefloor use. [...] Moving lights are also often used instead of having a large number of [...] "generic" [...] lights. [...] This is because one moving light can do the work of several <b>generics.</b>|$|E
2500|$|<b>Generics</b> (or {{parameterized}} types, parametric polymorphism) {{use type}} parameters, which {{make it possible}} to design classes and methods that do not specify the type used until the class or method is instantiated. The main advantage is that one can use generic type parameters to create classes and methods that can be used without incurring the cost of runtime casts or boxing operations, as shown here: ...|$|E
2500|$|Juries {{in several}} US states have found J guilty of concealing {{the adverse effects}} of Janssen Pharmaceuticals' {{antipsychotic}} medication Risperdal, produced by its unit, {{in order to promote}} it to doctors and patients as better than cheaper <b>generics,</b> and of falsely marketing it for treating patients with dementia. [...] States that have awarded damages include Texas ($158 million), South Carolina ($327 million), Louisiana ($258 million), and most notably Arkansas ($1.2 billion).|$|E
2500|$|Sanders is {{a staunch}} {{supporter}} {{of a universal}} health care system, and has said, [...] "If you are serious about real healthcare reform, {{the only way to}} go is single-payer." [...] He advocates lowering the cost of drugs that are expensive because they remain under patent for years; some drugs that cost thousands of dollars per year in the U.S. are available for hundreds, or less, in countries where they can be obtained as <b>generics.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In the mid 2010s the <b>generics</b> {{industry}} began transitioning {{to the end}} of an era {{of giant}} patent cliffs in the pharmaceutical industry; patented drugs with sales of around $28 billion were set to come off patent in 2018, but in 2019 only about $10 billion in revenue was set to open for competition, and less the next year. [...] Companies in the industry have responded with consolidation or turning to try to generate new drugs.|$|E
