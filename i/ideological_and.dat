5|$|At party level, the Labour Party, in {{opposition}} until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and {{supportive of the}} black nationalist movement on <b>ideological</b> <b>and</b> moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more sympathetic to the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ideological</b> <b>and</b> {{political}} rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism deeply influenced one another. For example, Wang Bi, one of {{the most}} influential philosophical commentators on Laozi (and Yijing), was a Confucian. The three rivals also share some similar values, with all three embracing a humanist philosophy emphasizing moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously. This became institutionalised when aspects of the three schools were synthesised in the Neo-Confucian school.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>ideological</b> <b>and</b> {{political}} {{strategies of}} the Vlaams Blok started out with its radical nationalist rejection of the People's Union compromise on the Flemish autonomy issue, later {{to be followed by}} focus on immigration and security, exploitation of corruption and other scandals, and defense of traditional values. While the party was legitimized first and foremost by its defense of Flemish interests, its voters were mainly motivated by anti-immigration and anti-establishment protest.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to reveal how {{entrepreneurs}} manage conflicts or contradictions between values, norms and beliefs specific to entrepreneurs’ ideology and capitalist requirements. In addition to the main purpose, this study also focus on what the preferences of entrepreneurs are when they have a conflict and contradiction between their <b>ideological</b> positions <b>and</b> capitalist requirements. In this context, interviews were conducted with eight entrepreneur who have invested in tourism industry. Interview data imply that when entrepreneurs have conflict between <b>ideological</b> norms-beliefs <b>and</b> capitalist requirements, they prefer <b>ideological</b> norms, beliefs, <b>and</b> avoid behaviour which are in conflict with their ideology. But, this implications always doesn’t mean that entrepreneurs doesn’t always prefer <b>ideological</b> norms <b>and</b> beliefs to capitalist requirements. Because data show that some new economic incomes and investment forms about tourism industry arise which enable to prefer <b>ideological</b> norms <b>and</b> beliefs...|$|R

5|$|As landholders and drafted {{government}} officials, the gentry {{considered themselves}} the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was {{essential for the}} county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the Tang dynasty (618–907). Civil service examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on <b>ideological</b> <b>and</b> policy issues led to political strife {{and the rise of}} political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke apart as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for civil service.|$|E
5|$|The Dashnaktsutiun held {{a meeting}} on April 26, 1907, dubbed the Fourth General Congress, at which ARF leaders such as Aram Manukian, Hamo Ohanjanyan and Stepan Stepanian {{discussed}} their engagement in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution. They established that the movement was one that had political, <b>ideological</b> <b>and</b> economic components and was thus aimed at establishing law and order, {{human rights and the}} interests of all working people. They also felt that it would work for the benefit and interest of Armenian-Iranians. The final vote was 25 votes in favour and one absentia.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{answer to}} these {{problems}} was to issue two decrees, one in 1977 and one in 1981, which called {{for an increase in}} the maximum size of privately owned plots within the Soviet Union to half a hectare. These measures removed important obstacles for the expansion of agricultural output, but did not solve the problem. Under Brezhnev, private plots yielded 30% of the national agricultural production when they only cultivated 4% of the land. This was seen by some as proof that de-collectivisation was necessary to prevent Soviet agriculture from collapsing, but leading Soviet politicians shrank from supporting such drastic measures due to <b>ideological</b> <b>and</b> political interests. The underlying problems were the growing shortage of skilled workers, a wrecked rural culture, the payment of workers in proportion to the quantity rather than the quality of their work, and too large farm machinery for the small collective farms and the roadless countryside. In the face of this, Brezhnev's only options were schemes such as large land reclamation and irrigation projects, or of course, radical reform.|$|E

5|$|The {{rulers of}} the princely states were not uniformly {{enthusiastic}} about integrating their domains into independent India. Some, such as the rulers of Bikaner and Jawhar, were motivated to join India out of <b>ideological</b> <b>and</b> patriotic considerations, but others insisted {{that they had the}} right to join either India or Pakistan, to remain independent, or form a union of their own. Bhopal, Travancore and Hyderabad announced that they did not intend to join either dominion. Hyderabad went as far as to appoint trade representatives in European countries and commencing negotiations with the Portuguese to lease or buy Goa to give it access to the sea, and Travancore pointed to the strategic importance to western countries of its thorium reserves while asking for recognition. Some states proposed a subcontinent-wide confederation of princely states, as a third entity in addition to India and Pakistan. Bhopal attempted to build an alliance between the princely states and the Muslim League to counter the pressure being put on rulers by the Congress.|$|E
5|$|Under the synthesis, debates {{have become}} less <b>ideological</b> <b>and</b> more methodological. Business cycle modelers {{can be broken}} into two camps: those in favor of {{calibration}} and those in favor of estimation. When models are calibrated, the modeler selects parameter values based on other studies or casual empirical observation. Instead of using statistical diagnostics to evaluate models, the model's operating characteristics determine {{the quality of the}} model. Kydland and Prescott (1982) offered no formal evaluation of their model, but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements of the model did. When estimation methods are used, models are evaluated based on standard statistical goodness of fit criteria. Calibration is generally associated with real business cycle modelers of the new classical school, but methodological differences cut across ideology. While Lucas, Prescott, and Kydland are calibration advocates, another prominent new classical, Sargent, favors estimation.|$|E

25|$|The {{incorporation}} of ancient concepts and {{racial and cultural}} assumptions into modern imperial ideology bolstered colonial claims to supremacy and right to colonize non-Europeans. Because of these numerous ramifications between ancient representations and modern colonial rhetoric, 19th century’s colonialist discourse acquires a “multi-layered” or “palimpsestic” structure. It forms a “historical, <b>ideological</b> <b>and</b> narcissistic continuum,” in which modern theories of domination feed upon and blend with “ancient myths of supremacy and grandeur”.|$|E
