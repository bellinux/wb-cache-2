5|$|The Toy Story {{films and}} {{characters}} will always hold {{a very special}} place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy's room, we thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way.|$|E

We both loved that song {{and we both}} thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> for Weezer, and for my voice, and it’d be great to do like a rock version of it with more of an alternative aesthetic. And you know, just the way I would sing it versus in the way Toni Braxton would sing it. And I love the way it came out, and I think probably {{the rest of the}} band really does not like it, and that’s probably why it didn’t make our fifth record, in 2005 when we were recording it." ...|$|E

"It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> glory for a {{small band}} to fight a big one, no doubt," [...] {{returned}} the leader in a sarcastic tone; [...] "but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>greater</b> glory for one man to do that alone--so you had better stay here and fight them yourself." ...|$|R

500|$|George Lucas {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film (originally titled Munchkins) in 1972. Similar in intent to Star Wars, he created [...] "a number of well-known mythological situations for a young audience". During the production of Return of the Jedi in 1982, Lucas approached Warwick Davis, who was portraying Wicket the Ewok, about playing Willow Ufgood. Five years passed before he was actually cast in the role. Lucas [...] "thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> to use a little person in a lead role. A lot of my movies are about a little guy against the system, and this was just a more literal interpretation of that idea." ...|$|E
500|$|Bakshi had {{originally}} intended to cast Drew Barrymore and Brad Pitt in the film's leading roles. Brad Pitt was cast as Frank Harris instead, with Gabriel Byrne as Deebs and Kim Basinger as Holli. The film's voice cast includes Maurice LaMarche, Charlie Adler and Candi Milo. According to Bakshi, Basinger had attempted to rewrite the film halfway into its production because she [...] "thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> [...] if {{she would be able}} to show this picture in hospitals to sick children [...] I said, 'Kim, I think that's wonderful, but you've got the wrong guy to do that with.' [...] was sitting there with Kim [...] agreeing with her." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, both Toy Story and Toy Story 2 were {{converted}} to 3-D for a two-week limited theatrical re-release, which was extended due to its success. Lasseter said, [...] "The Toy Story films and characters will always hold a very special place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way, thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. [...] With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy's room, we thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way".|$|E

500|$|In July 2010, Feargus Urquhart, {{replying}} to {{an interview}} question about what franchises {{he would like to}} work on, said that [...] "if [...] could come across everything that [...] played", he would choose a Chrono Trigger game. At the time, Urquhart's company Obsidian Entertainment was making Dungeon Siege III for Square Enix. Urquhart said: [...] "You make RPGs, we make RPGs, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> to see what we could do together. And they really wanted to start getting into Western RPGs. And, so it kind of all ended up fitting together." [...] Yoshinori Kitase revealed in 2011 that he used the time travel mechanics of Chrono Trigger {{as a starting point for}} that of Final Fantasy XIII-2.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, {{while working}} on several films, A. R. Rahman {{received}} an email from Danny Boyle, {{the director of the}} film Slumdog Millionaire, stating: [...] "Hey I'm Danny Boyle, I like your work, and <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> for us to have you on our film". Rahman was unsure how to answer, but after exchanging several more emails, they met in Mumbai. Rahman summarized their first meeting by saying [...] "when I talked to him, I had some interest and I wanted to see the film. He had a first cut of the film already, and when I saw that I was really interested and wanted to do it. So I left another film to do this one. I made time for it".|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, Record Collector {{published}} {{an interview with}} Ray Davies in which he said, [...] "I spoke to Quaife {{about a month ago}} and he dearly wants to make another record with me. I think Dave's getting better and Mick's still playing. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> to get back together just to see what musical ideas we had, and what would happen." [...] The Daily Mail subsequently interpreted his comments as a declaration that a reunion of the band's original line-up was imminent. Dave Davies swiftly rejected the idea of a reunion. He told a reporter that [...] "it would be like a bad remake of Night of the Living Dead" [...] and added, [...] "Ray has been doing Karaoke Kinks shows since 1996." ...|$|E

500|$|Hurd {{recalled}} {{that she had}} heard of the comic before, and upon reading it, felt that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> for film. She stated: [...] "When I first read the book, I thought, 'This would be a great film,' and boy was I wrong. It's a much better TV series. Fast forward, I knew that Frank had initially developed it for NBC, which to me seemed like an odd pairing for this. Then I heard it wasn't going forward at NBC so I talked to Frank." [...] On January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot with Darabont and Hurd acting as executive producers; the former wrote the script and directed the episode. The entire series was pre-ordered based on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement.|$|E
500|$|In August 2015, Cornell openly said in {{interview}} with Total Guitar {{that he was}} quite eager to reunite with Audioslave: [...] "I think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great.</b> We {{did a lot of}} songs, and with the benefit of not having done anything with those guys for so long, I can't imagine what it would be. It would be a really amazing experience just to get back and work with the same guys again." [...] Soon after, Morello said that he's interested in working with Cornell again, remembering their 2014 Seattle performance with great fondness: [...] "I love Chris and consider him a great friend. The Hall of Fame jam was nice, but a little chaotic. Playing with him in Seattle, that was just fantastic. I love that guy. He's one of the most talented vocalists in the history of vocalists. And {{to be able to play}} the songs that we wrote together, it was awesome and so much fun. I hope we do something like that again." ...|$|E

[...] It's bad enough that you people get all the parking spots!" [...] To an individual with Tourette syndrome, she says, [...] "I think Tourettes is so cool. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> to be able to annoy people like that. You get to whoop and twitch. Any other good ones?" [...] A passing blind man accidentally taps her with his cane, and Ling cries, [...] "OW! [...] They're not weapons!...I so prefer the deaf to the blind." [...] Ling will even impersonate the blind to get her way. In one episode she puts on sunglasses, extends a telescoping white cane, and walks across a busy street, [...] tires squealing as she hits a couple of cars with her cane. [...] Ling is unapologetic for these affronts. When pointed out that [...] "there are real blind people in the world", Ling retorts, [...] "It's not like any of them saw me." ...|$|E
50|$|One {{approach}} {{to test whether}} an observed value of ρ is significantly different from zero (r will always maintain −1 ≤ r ≤ 1) is to calculate the probability that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>greater</b> {{than or equal to}} the observed r, given the null hypothesis, by using a permutation test. An advantage of this approach is that it automatically takes into account the number of tied data values there are in the sample, and the way they are treated in computing the rank correlation.|$|R

500|$|When {{asked in}} 2012 about {{his brother and}} an Oasis reunion Gallagher said [...] "I last texted Liam at Christmas after the City match. I don't think it's gonna happen. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> for {{everyone}} else except me. It'd be mega for the millions and millions and everybody else it would be brilliant but I wouldn't be very happy about it. I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like to do it for longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E
500|$|While {{discussing}} {{the origin of}} the title [...] "Rhythm Nation", Jackson stated she first uttered the phrase during a conversation with her producers. [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> if we could create our own nation" [...] adding that it would be [...] "one that would have a positive message and that everyone would be free to join." [...] She based the idea on the prevalence of various youth groups and organizations that are formed as a means of creating a common identity. The usage of the number [...] "1814" [...] represents the year the national anthem [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] was written. Rolling Stone emphasized the core concept is further explored in the album's opening pledge (the first track of the recording), which states: [...] "We are a nation with no geographic boundaries, bound together through our beliefs. We are like-minded individuals, sharing a common vision, pushing toward a world rid of color-lines." [...] Several critics noted that [...] "R" [...] (Rhythm) and [...] "N" [...] (Nation) are the eighteenth and fourteenth letters of the alphabet, though Jackson said this was coincidental.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Nigel Dick and filmed on June 14 and 15, 1999 at the Redondo Beach, California. Spears conceptualized the video's treatment, and explained during an interview with MTV in 1999 that [...] "it would be cool {{to be in a}} club, and we're dorky waitresses, and we break out and start dancing." [...] At the time, Spears expected that the video would take her [...] "to the next level". To promote the film Drive Me Crazy, actors Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart were invited to make cameo appearances in the video, since the song had been included on the film's soundtrack, however, Grenier did not want to participate. Dick commented on the issue, saying, [...] "I was given instructions to ring him up and make sure he appeared in the video. I said, 'You know what, Adrian, I just think <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> for your career, and Britney's a great girl and she's fun to work with.' Eventually he came around." [...] Dick also revealed that he was impressed by the singer's work ethic, adding that she [...] "came to the set completely rehearsed." [...] The music video premiered on MTV's Making the Video special that aired on July 18, 1999.|$|E

500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it." ...|$|E
500|$|IGN {{gave the}} games a 9/10, a higher rating {{than any of}} the other Nintendo DS Pokémon games. The review praised the games for {{renewing}} interest in the series, though criticized some of the new Pokémon designs, explaining that [...] "aside from a weaker lineup of monsters (largely an aesthetic complaint), this is the best Pokémon has to offer on every level, renewing my waning interest in monster battling". Jeremy Parish of Retronauts criticized Black and White, commenting that he grew tired of it shortly after starting and feeling like it was too similar to all previous Pokémon games. He further went on to say that EVs and IVs, invisible mechanics in the game, are not necessarily beneficial. By contrast, he noted that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> to new players. He also compared it to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games and Final Fantasy XIII, arguing that they all share the common element of being bad before they get good. Fellow Retronauts contributor Justin Haywald criticized the games' release on the DS, which had received two main Pokémon series games published before them. GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson stated [...] "It may not break the Pokemon mold, but Black/White offers enough new content coupled with the series' classic, deep battle mechanics to make it endlessly playable. If you could only play one game for the rest of your life, this would be a wise choice." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that just goes to show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>great</b> if the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E
