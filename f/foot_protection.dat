50|$|Several {{other items}} of {{equipment}} {{are commonly used}} by surf fisherman and surfcasters to improve comfort, convenience and effectiveness. Among these are waders, used to wade out into the surf to gain distance from shore when casting the bait. Full length, chest-high waders are most popular, {{in order to provide}} a measure of protection against a pounding surf that could easily swamp hip-length wading boots. In addition to the extra reach provided by wading out from shore, waders provide improved <b>footing,</b> <b>protection</b> for <b>feet</b> and legs from sharp bottom objects and stinging/biting fish and crustaceans, and protection from cold water temperatures. Most surf fishermen prefer integrated booted waders to stocking-foot models, which eliminates the tendency of sand and rock to find their way in between boot and wader. In areas where the bottom consists of slippery rocks or when fishing from mossy and slimy rock jetties, cleated boots or attachments are utilized to improve footing and enhance safety.|$|R
50|$|Childhood {{lessons learned}} from his father, a tanner, now served him well. For example, when his clothes wore out, he made new ones from hair-covered goatskins using a nail for sewing. As his shoes became unusable, he {{had no need to}} replace them, since his toughened, calloused <b>feet</b> made <b>protection</b> unnecessary. He sang psalms and read from the Bible, finding it a comfort in his {{situation}} and a prop for his English.|$|R
50|$|In {{the sport}} {{not only is}} skill {{required}} but {{you also need to}} use the right equipment. When competing you will need a few basic items: cross-cut saws, bow saws, axes, peaveies, <b>foot</b> and leg <b>protection,</b> and climbing gear for the pole climb.|$|R

50|$|Several {{styles of}} wetsuit boots are {{commonly}} used for kayaking. Short-cut boots are frequently used in warmer conditions where the boots help give grip and <b>foot</b> <b>protection</b> while launching and portaging. In cold conditions longer wetsuit boots may be used with a drysuit where they are worn over the rubber drysuit socks.|$|E

50|$|In this species, {{the shape}} of the {{operculum}} changes during growth, from a rounded shape in juveniles to a curved shape in adults. The relative size of the operculum decreases as individuals grow. About a half of all adult snails of this species possess an operculum among the sclerites {{at the rear of the}} animal. It seems likely that the sclerites gradually grow and fully cover the whole <b>foot</b> for <b>protection,</b> and the operculum loses its protective function as the animal grows.|$|R

50|$|Open-heel fins have a foot pocket {{with an open}} heel area, and the fin is held to {{the foot}} by springs or straps which are usually {{adjustable}} and so will fit a limited range of foot sizes. They can be worn over boots and are common in diving, in particular where a diver has {{to walk into the}} water from a shore and requires <b>foot</b> <b>protection.</b> Some manufacturers produce fins with the same blade architecture but a choice of heel type.|$|E
5000|$|Digging in. In World War I, even heavy {{artillery}} was dug-in with several <b>feet</b> of overhead <b>protection.</b> Even today North Korean artillery is widely {{thought to be}} somewhat resistant to CB fire because of its deeply entrenched positions. More generally precision munitions have decreased the value of digging.|$|R

50|$|The {{most basic}} <b>foot</b> <b>protection,</b> used since ancient {{times in the}} Mediterranean area, was the sandal, which {{consisted}} of a protective sole, held to the foot with leather thongs or cords of various materials. Similar footwear worn in the Far East was made from plaited grass or palm fronds. In climates that required a full foot covering, {{a single piece of}} untanned hide was laced with a thong, providing full protection for the foot and so made a complete covering.|$|E
50|$|September 14, 1974 on ABC's Wide World of Entertainment {{promoter}} Mike Anderson introduced PKA 'full-contact' karate. In the bouts, competitors wore foam {{hand and}} <b>foot</b> <b>protection</b> and fought to the knockout (Kickboxing rules allowed for leg kicks: full-contact karate rules {{did not permit}} kicks to the legs). Lewis, the retired US Heavyweight Kickboxing champion was accustomed to full contact fighting. In 1974 he beat his only opponent in the new sport of full contact karate with a 2nd round ridge hand knockout over Yugoslavia's Frank Brodar in Los Angeles, California to win the Professional Karate Association (PKA) Heavyweight full-contact karate title.|$|E
50|$|Combat {{boots are}} {{military}} boots {{designed to be}} worn by soldiers during combat or combat training, as opposed to during parades and other ceremonial duties. Modern combat boots are {{designed to provide a}} combination of grip, ankle stability, and <b>foot</b> <b>protection</b> suitable for a rugged environment. They are traditionally made of hardened and sometimes waterproofed leather. Today, many combat boots incorporate technologies originating in civilian hiking boots, such as Gore-Tex nylon side panels, which improve ventilation and comfort. They are also often specialized for certain climates and conditions, such as jungle boots, desert boots, and cold weather boots as well as specific uses, such as tanker boots and jump boots.|$|E
25|$|Competitors do {{not wear}} the hogu (although they are {{required}} to wear approved <b>foot</b> and hand <b>protection</b> equipment, as well as optional head guards). This scoring system varies between individual organisations within the ITF; for example, in the TAGB, punches to the head or body score 1 point, kicks to the body score 2 points, and kicks to the head score 3 points.|$|R
30|$|We can preliminarily {{conclude}} that SMAT providing governments with data that inform forward-looking policies {{are standing on}} a weak legal <b>footing</b> whilst data <b>protection</b> legislation and jurisdiction fall short in grasping the potential consequences coming from these new technologies and their rapid progress. Despite a certain protectiveness towards privacy rights that {{is shown in the}} current legal debate, SMA tools remain in large parts unregulated [36].|$|R
50|$|Minimalist {{shoes are}} shoes {{intended}} to closely approximate barefoot running conditions. They have reduced cushioning, thin soles, and are of lighter weight than other running shoes, allowing for more sensory contact for the {{foot on the}} ground while simultaneously providing the <b>feet</b> with some <b>protection</b> from ground hazards and conditions (such as pebbles and dirt). Research shows that wearing a minimalist shoe can help improve foot strength and arch function.|$|R
50|$|Most men {{typically}} just {{wear the}} towel provided.

50|$|Chromoblastomycosis {{infection}} occurs by subcutaneous puncture by a thorn or splinter that is {{infected with}} C. carrionii, such as decaying cacti and wood. Scratching at the lesions worsens the infection by spreading the fungus over larger and distal {{areas of the}} body. Field workers who work without <b>foot</b> <b>protection</b> or clothing covering legs and arms {{are at greater risk}} for inoculation by material colonized by C. carrionii. Immunocompromised individuals are also at risk, because the ability to produce antibodies against fungal proteins is critical in minimizing fungal pathogenicity and C. carrionii may penetrate deeper into muscle and bone layers if the patient is immunosuppressed. Even if an individual is immunocompetent, they may be at risk if they carry the HLA-A29 antigen, since its presence may increase an individual’s susceptibility to contracting chromoblastomycosis. Histology tests from a skin biopsy can identify muriform cells that are commonly found in chromoblastomycosis. Identifying the specific agent that caused chromoblastomycosis can be done by PCR assays or culturing the fungus by growing it on an agar plate and observing the colony morphology and sporulation characteristics. However, C. carrionii grows quite slowly in culture, so significant results cannot be obtained until after 4-6 weeks of incubation.|$|E
50|$|To {{people who}} are close to a blast incident, such as bomb {{disposal}} technicians, soldiers wearing body armor, deminers or individuals wearing little to no protection, there are four types of blast effects on the human body: overpressure (shock), fragmentation, impact and heat. Overpressure refers to the sudden and drastic rise in ambient pressure that can damage the internal organs, possibly leading to permanent damage or death. Fragmentation includes the shrapnel described above but can also include sand, debris and vegetation from the area surrounding the blast source. This is very common in anti-personnel mine blasts. The projection of materials poses a potentially lethal threat caused by cuts in soft tissues, as well as infections, and injuries to the internal organs. When the overpressure wave impacts the body it can induce violent levels of blast-induced acceleration. Resulting injuries may range from minor to unsurvivable. Immediately following this initial acceleration, deceleration injuries can occur when a person impacts directly against a rigid surface or obstacle after being {{set in motion by}} the force of the blast. Finally, injury and fatality can result from the explosive fireball as well as incendiary agents projected onto the body. Personal protective equipment, such as a bomb suit or demining ensemble, as well as helmets, visors and <b>foot</b> <b>protection,</b> can dramatically reduce the four effects, depending upon the charge, proximity and other variables.|$|E
50|$|If the climber climbs {{three feet}} {{higher than the}} last piece of {{protection}} in the rock, and then falls, the rope allows him to fall the three <b>feet</b> to the <b>protection,</b> and another three feet below that. If they fall any further, rope is pulled upwards through the protection from the belayer below. Because the belayer generally keeps the rope locked off, the climber's fall should be arrested and they are left suspended, but safe, somewhere below the protection.|$|R
5000|$|In {{exceptional}} cases, bunkers {{have been}} found buried hundreds of feet underground, with several <b>feet</b> of concrete <b>protection</b> and enough food and living space to last for weeks without resupply. Some of Hezbollah's tunnels have been thousands of meters long. Israeli sources say that North Korean instructors traveled to Lebanon in 2004 and oversaw construction of Hezbollah's underground infrastructure. In 2013, a United States federal court found that North Korea gave Hezbollah [...] "advanced weapons, expert advice and construction assistance" [...] in building [...] "a massive network of underground military installations, tunnels, bunkers, depots and storage facilities in southern Lebanon." ...|$|R

The League is a global organization dedicated to seeking out and eradicating governments. Established at some unknown point during or after the global revolt, the League is organized around [...] "League camps" [...] which dot the landscape. Members of the League are easily recognized by their [...] "ironite staffs": metallic walking sticks which they are trained in using as weapons. These tools are a symbol of the League—"the walking Anarchists who patrolled the world on <b>foot,</b> the world's <b>protection</b> agency." ...|$|R
