5|$|Progestin-only pills, {{injections}} and intrauterine {{devices are}} {{not associated with}} an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with previous blood clots in their veins. In those with a history of arterial blood clots, non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used. Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods. The progestins <b>drospirenone</b> and desogestrel minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line. The perfect use first-year failure rate of the injectable progestin, Depo-Provera, is 0.2%; the typical use first failure rate is 6%.|$|E
5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as desogestrel, <b>drospirenone,</b> or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E
25|$|Fourth {{generation}} COCPs {{are sometimes}} {{defined as those}} containing the progestin drospirenone; and sometimes defined as those containing <b>drospirenone,</b> dienogest, or nomegestrol acetate.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} many {{formulations}} of estradiol combined with one of various progestins, such as norethisterone (in Activelle, Novofem and Cliovelle), levonorgestrel, medroxyprogesterone (in Indivina), dienogest or <b>drospirenone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{is closely}} {{structurally}} related to other clinically used spirolactones such as canrenone, potassium canrenoate, <b>drospirenone,</b> and eplerenone, {{as well as}} to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7α-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), spirorenone (ZK-35973), and mespirenone (ZK-94679).|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, <b>drospirenone,</b> and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E

50|$|Based {{on these}} studies, in 2012 the FDA updated the label for <b>drospirenone</b> COCPs {{to include a}} warning that {{contraceptives}} with <b>drospirenone</b> may have {{a higher risk of}} dangerous blood clots.|$|E
50|$|The FDA {{recently}} updated {{the label}} for contraceptives containing <b>drospirenone</b> to include warnings for stopping use {{prior to and}} after surgery, and to warn that contraceptives with <b>drospirenone</b> may have {{a higher risk of}} dangerous blood clots.|$|E
50|$|<b>Drospirenone</b> is 8-10 {{times more}} potent as an antimineralocorticoid {{relative}} to spironolactone (3 mg <b>drospirenone</b> {{is equivalent to}} about 20-25 mg spironolactone in this regard). It is more potent as an antiandrogen relative to spironolactone also but is less potent relative to cyproterone acetate, having about one-third the potency of this drug. Progestogenic, antimineralocorticoid, and mild antiandrogenic effects have been observed in humans during treatment with <b>drospirenone</b> at a dosage range of 0.5 to 4 mg per day orally.|$|E

5000|$|One {{study showed}} {{more than a}} 600% {{increased}} risk of blood clots for women taking COCPs with <b>drospirenone</b> compared with non-users, compared with 360% higher for women taking birth control pills containing levonorgestrel. [...] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated studies evaluating the health of more than 800,000 women taking COCPs {{and found that the}} risk of VTE was 93% higher for women who had been taking <b>drospirenone</b> COCPs for 3 months or less and 290% higher for women taking <b>drospirenone</b> COCPs for 7-12 months, compared with women taking other types of oral contraceptives.|$|E

5000|$|Fourth generation: Approved for {{marketing}} after 2000. Examples: <b>drospirenone,</b> norelgestromin, segesterone acetate (nestorone).|$|E
50|$|<b>Drospirenone</b> binds {{strongly}} to the progesterone receptor (PR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), with lower affinity, to the androgen receptor (AR), and very low {{affinity for the}} glucocorticoid receptor (GR). It is an agonist of the PR and an antagonist of the MR and AR, and hence, a progestogen, antimineralocorticoid, and antiandrogen. <b>Drospirenone</b> {{is said to be}} devoid of any estrogenic or glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity. It has potent antigonadotropic effects at sufficient dosages as a result of PR activation. It has been regarded that <b>drospirenone</b> has a pharmacological profile that is very closely related to that of natural progesterone, due to the combination of both progestogenic and antimineralocorticoid actions.|$|E
50|$|Another FDA {{approved}} {{treatment for}} PMDD is the oral contraceptive with ethinylestradiol and <b>drospirenone,</b> a novel progestin. It {{has been shown}} that hormonal birth control containing <b>drospirenone</b> and low levels of estrogen helps relieve severe PMDD symptoms, for at least the first three months it is used. The idea behind using oral contraceptives is to suppress ovulation by controlling sex hormone fluctuations during the luteal phase.|$|E
5000|$|While all oral {{contraceptives}} {{can increase the}} risk for venous thrombembolic events, including fatal blood clots, several studies have reported a greater risk for women taking contraceptives containing <b>drospirenone.</b> (Before becoming alarmed at the huge [...] "relative" [...] differences in risk, one must remember that the [...] "actual" [...] risks involved are quite small — {{in the neighborhood of}} 1 in 10,000 to 27 in 10,000 in a year). When the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became concerned about the risks of <b>drospirenone,</b> they funded studies based on the medical records of more than 800,000 women taking {{oral contraceptives}}. They found that the risk of VTE, which includes dangerous and potentially fatal blood clots, was 93% higher for women who had been taking oral contraceptives made with <b>drospirenone</b> for only 3 months or less and 290% higher for women taking <b>drospirenone</b> oral contraceptives for 7-12 months, compared to women taking other types of oral contraceptives. To determine the exact risk for women of different ages and different circumstances, further study is warranted.|$|E
50|$|Some drugs {{also have}} antimineralocorticoid effects {{secondary}} to their main mechanism of actions. Examples include progesterone, <b>drospirenone,</b> gestodene, and benidipine.|$|E
50|$|In {{clinical}} trials, spirorenone {{was found}} to be 4- to 10-fold as potent as spironolactone as an antimineralocorticoid, and {{is said to be the}} most active antimineralocorticoid identified to date. However, it was serendipitously and unexpectedly found that low doses of spirorenone lowered testosterone levels in men during clinical studies. This was determined to be due to metabolic conversion of spirorenone into <b>drospirenone</b> (1,2-dihydrospirorenone) by the enzyme Δ1-hydrase, a transformation that occurs only in monkeys and humans. Unlike spirorenone, <b>drospirenone</b> {{was found to}} be a highly potent progestin and antiandrogen in addition to antimineralocorticoid, with 8-fold the potency of spironolactone as an antimineralocorticoid and 0.3 times the potency of cyproterone acetate as an antiandrogen. Subsequently, investigation of spirorenone was discontinued and <b>drospirenone</b> was developed and eventually introduced instead as a contraceptive.|$|E
