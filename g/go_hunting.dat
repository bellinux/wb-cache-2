5|$|In {{the later}} and better-known version of Compert Con Culainn, Deichtine is Conchobar's sister, and disappears from Emain Macha, the Ulster capital. As in the {{previous}} version, the Ulstermen <b>go</b> <b>hunting</b> a flock of magical birds, are overtaken by a snowstorm and seek shelter in a nearby house. Their host is Lug, but this time his wife, who gives birth to a son that night, is Deichtine herself. The child is named Sétanta.|$|E
5|$|The Natchez {{then began}} {{to prepare for a}} strike on the French at Fort Rosalie, {{borrowing}} firearms from some French colonists with promises to <b>go</b> <b>hunting</b> and to share the game with the guns' owners. Some French men and women overheard the Natchez planning such an attack. According to Le Page du Pratz, it was the Natchez female chief Tattooed Arm who attempted to alert the French of an upcoming attack led by her rivals at White Apple. When colonists told Chépart, he disregarded them and placed some in irons on the night before the massacre, when he was drunk.|$|E

5|$|Initially overjoyed at the {{prospect}} of marrying, Marguerite Louise's ebullience faded to dismay when she discovered her half-sister, despite initially favouring the Tuscan match, then changed her mind. In reaction, Marguerite Louise's behaviour became erratic: she shocked the court by going out unaccompanied, a grievous offence in contemporary French society, with her cousin Prince Charles of Lorraine, who soon became her lover. Her marriage by proxy, on 19 April 1661, did nothing to change her attitude, much to the annoyance of Louis XIV's ministers. On the day she was supposed to meet diplomats offering their congratulations on the wedding, she attempted to abscond and <b>go</b> <b>hunting,</b> only to be stopped by the Duchess of Montpensier.|$|E
5|$|Lonely and needing {{someone to}} care for his {{children}} and help with the sewing and other chores, Mala takes the young girl Iva as his new wife. But Mala still longs for Aba, and their relationship is a cold one. The Eskimos <b>go</b> <b>hunting</b> caribou by stampeding the animals into a lake and then hunting them with bow and arrow and spears from boats. Mala is haunted by Aba's death, and after pouring out his grief through dance and prayer he changes his name to Kripik. Kripik's attitude toward Iva softens dramatically, and they make love. The hunter whom Mala welcomed to the village the previous year returns to his village, and gives Kripik his wife in gratitude. The woman is {{more than happy to}} live with Mala, and Mala makes love to her as well.|$|E

25|$|Albert {{had been}} {{introduced}} to deer stalking at Taymouth back in 1840 when he was rather fortunate in successfully shooting a stag and he took up this new pastime finding that the area around Loch Muick on the estate was a good location. They had rebuilt the shooting lodge of Allt-na-giubhsaich {{at the foot of}} Loch Muick and, although Victoria did not <b>go</b> <b>hunting,</b> she liked visiting there to relax away from visiting dignitaries and to do painting.|$|E
25|$|The {{foregoing}} examples {{present the}} Salticidae as textbook examples of active hunters; they would hardly {{seem likely to}} build webs other than those used in reproductive activities, and in fact, most species really do not build webs to catch prey. However, exceptions occur, though even those that do build capture webs generally also <b>go</b> <b>hunting</b> like other salticids. Some Portia species, for example, spin capture webs that are functional, though not as impressive as some orb webs of the Araneidae; Portia webs are of an unusual funnel shape and apparently adapted to the capture of other spiders. Spartaeus species, on the other hand, largely capture moths in their webs. In their review of the ethology of Salticidae, Richman and Jackson speculate on whether such web building is {{a relic of the}} evolution of this family from web-building ancestors.|$|E

25|$|In the Sundarbans, 10 out of 13 man-eaters {{recorded}} in the 1970s were males, and they accounted for 86% of the victims. These man-eaters have been grouped into the confirmed or dedicated ones who <b>go</b> <b>hunting</b> especially for human prey; and the opportunistic ones, who do not search for humans but will, if they encounter a man, attack, kill and devour him. In areas where opportunistic man-eaters were found, the killing of humans was correlated with their availability, most victims being claimed during the honey gathering season. Tigers in the Sunderbans presumably attacked humans who entered their territories in search of wood, honey or fish, thus causing them to defend their territories. The number of tiger attacks on humans may be higher outside suitable areas for tigers, where numerous humans are present but which contain little wild prey for tigers. Between 1999 and 2001, the highest concentration of tiger attacks on people occurred in the northern and western boundaries of the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Most people were attacked in the mornings while collecting fuel wood, timber, or other raw materials, or while fishing.|$|E
25|$|Since Cole's identification, {{investigation}} is now aimed at locating {{the person responsible}} for her murder. Frances Aucoin, whose father, John Chesson, discovered Cole's remains along with her brother, told officers that she suspects he is responsible for the victim's death. Police confirm that Chesson is considered a person of interest in the case, especially because of his conviction for the murder of his estranged wife's former mother-in-law, but he has yet to be considered the prime suspect. Aucoin believes that Chesson had decided to <b>go</b> <b>hunting</b> {{for the first time with}} his children to establish his innocence by finding the victim's body and reporting it to the police. She went into further detail, describing her father as abusive and that she believes that a young woman he had brought into their home was Cole whom he had picked up as a hitchhiker. Aucoin's brother, a witness in finding the body, committed suicide in 2008. Chesson is currently incarcerated for life for the murder of his estranged wife's former mother-in-law, which occurred in 1997.|$|E
500|$|For Paula Kahumbu, CEO of Kenya's WildlifeDirect, {{maintaining}} stockpiles does {{too much}} to enable illegal trade to justify keeping it rather than destroying it. She told NPR that when an ivory dealer wants to obtain ivory, the most sensible way {{to do so is}} not to <b>go</b> <b>hunting,</b> which carries many risks, but to [...] "raid a stockpile by bribing the guy who has the key". She gives examples of tusks being lost from vaults and even courtroom exhibits due to corruption.|$|E

500|$|Uncertain of the letter's meaning, Monteagle {{promptly}} rode to Whitehall {{and handed}} it to Cecil (then Earl of Salisbury). [...] Salisbury informed the Earl of Worcester, considered to have recusant sympathies, and the suspected catholic Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, but kept news of the plot from the King, who was busy hunting in Cambridgeshire and not expected back for several days. [...] Monteagle's servant, Thomas Ward, had family connections with the Wright brothers, and sent a message to Catesby about the betrayal. [...] Catesby, who had been due to <b>go</b> <b>hunting</b> with the King, suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, and with Thomas Wintour confronted the recently recruited conspirator. [...] Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, but urged them to abandon the plot. [...] Salisbury was already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, but did not yet know the exact nature of the plot, or who exactly was involved. [...] He therefore elected to wait, to see how events unfolded.|$|E
500|$|Between May 1972 and April 1973, Kemper {{embarked}} on a murder spree that started with two college students and ended with the murders {{of his mother and}} her best friend. He would pick up female students who were hitchhiking and take them to isolated areas where he would shoot, stab, smother or strangle them. He would then take their lifeless bodies back to his home where he would perform irrumatio on their severed heads, have sex with their corpses, and then dissect and dismember them. During this 11-month spree, he killed five women, including two college students, one high school student, his mother and his mother's best friend. Kemper has stated in interviews that he would often <b>go</b> <b>hunting</b> for victims after his mother's outbursts towards him, and that she would not introduce him to women attending the university she worked at. He recalled: [...] "She would say, 'You're just like your father. You don't deserve to get to know them'." [...] Psychiatrists, and Kemper himself, have espoused the belief that the young women were surrogates for his ultimate target, his mother, and that the humiliating acts he committed with his mother's corpse support this hypothesis.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the conspirators}} {{expressed}} worries about fellow Catholics {{who would be}} caught up in the planned explosion; Percy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and when the young Earl of Arundel's name was mentioned Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day. Keyes's suggestion to warn the Earl of Peterborough was, however, derided. On 26October William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle (Tresham's brother-in-law) received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton, warning him not to attend Parliament, and forecasting that [...] "they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament; and yet they shall not see who hurts them". Uncertain of its meaning he delivered it to Secretary of State Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. In an extraordinary act of bravado Catesby had planned to <b>go</b> <b>hunting</b> with James, but was warned of the betrayal by Monteagle's servant. He immediately suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, a view which was shared by Thomas Wintour. Together the two confronted the recently recruited conspirator, and threatened to [...] "hang him", but Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, and the next day urged them to abandon the plot.|$|E
