25|$|There {{are several}} common terms used for Image <b>Intensifier</b> tubes.|$|E
25|$|An image <b>intensifier</b> or image <b>intensifier</b> tube is {{a vacuum}} tube device for {{increasing}} the intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low-light conditions, such as at night, to facilitate visual imaging of low-light processes, such as fluorescence of materials in X-rays or gamma rays (X-ray image <b>intensifier),</b> or for conversion of non-visible light sources, such as near-infrared or short wave infrared to visible. They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a microchannel plate), and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night vision goggles.|$|E

40|$|Our exam {{paper is}} about young adults’ use of <b>intensifiers</b> in school papers. The {{theoretical}} background includes previous research about <b>intensifiers</b> in the Swedish language {{and above all}} young adults’ use of <b>intensifiers.</b> We have chosen to focus on all intensifying expressions which young adults’ use, because {{we did not want}} to limit our research material. We made a comparing study of 25 student papers from year 1999 and 25 student papers from year 2009 to find similarities and differences. Our result answers our four main questions: “How has the frequency of <b>intensifiers</b> changed from year 1999 to year 2009 ?”, “Which new <b>intensifiers</b> have been added?”, “In which contexts are <b>intensifiers</b> used?” and “Are there any differences in the use of <b>intensifiers</b> between boys and girls?”. The result shows that the number of <b>intensifiers</b> has increased during the 10 year period but that the selection of used <b>intensifiers</b> has decreased. Furthermore is a change in which <b>intensifiers</b> that are used and in which contexts they are used illustrated. The result also shows that boys in year 1999 use <b>intensifiers</b> more frequently than the girls, but in year 2009 the result was opposite...|$|R

[...] But if a judge's authoritative written opinion uses {{a high rate of}} <b>intensifiers,</b> a lawyer's written appeal of that opinion that also uses a high rate of <b>intensifiers</b> is associated with an increase in favorable outcomes for such appeals. Also, when judges disagree with each other in writing, they tend to use more <b>intensifiers.</b>|$|R

It provides an elegant model for investigating the whys and wherefores of adverbial <b>intensifiers.</b> Specifically, the main emphasis {{lies on the}} motivations behind choosing from among competing <b>intensifiers</b> in a non-haphazard way. The model is meant as a ‘combinatory chart’ that allows for fair comparison of near-synonymic <b>intensifiers</b> {{with respect to a}} number of parameters of variation or textual preferences on the morpho-syntactic, lexico-semantic and discourse-pragmatic levels. It is intended as {{the first step in a}} comprehensive study of English and Italian predicate-intensifiers collocations. Among its expected applications are a combinatory dictionary of English <b>intensifiers</b> and a bilingual combinatory dictionary of English and Italian <b>intensifiers...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractSpeech carries, in {{addition}} to its propositional meaning, the functional intentions of the speaker (illocution). Persian language is governed by norms the realization of which makes significant cross-cultural differences. This study is an attempt to investigate the proportion by which <b>intensifiers</b> are used in the two speech acts of apology and compliment. More specifically, it tries to investigate how using <b>intensifiers</b> ensures the desirable level of appropriateness for Persian speakers and, generally speaking, why they are used in that proportion. Moreover, it tries to find out whether gender tends to affect the differential degrees of use of <b>intensifiers.</b> To this end, Persian apologetic and compliment utterances were collected through interview as well as eliciting Discourse Completion Test (DCT) data. The findings of the analysis reveal that Persian speakers use <b>intensifiers</b> extensively in both apology and compliment speech acts. Significant differences are also observed in the type, frequency, and illocutionary effect of using <b>intensifiers</b> in apology and compliment speech acts. The interview data show that Persian participants believe they are concerned about the illocutionary effect of their speech acts in order to make sure that face has been sufficiently served in apology. In compliments, <b>intensifiers</b> are used in a typical sense to show the illocutionary force of the speaker's act. <b>Intensifiers</b> are also used differently across genders: female speakers show greater tendency to use <b>intensifiers</b> than male speakers...|$|R

In addition, this paper investigates if an indirect effect can be established by which sensationalistic message features influence news reception through the perception of sensationalism. Two between-subjects experiments show that sensationalistic message features like <b>intensifiers</b> increase perceived language intensity (PLI). In experiment 1, <b>intensifiers</b> had {{a negative effect on}} news article appreciation, which was not influenced by PLI.

25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} image <b>intensifier</b> tubes {{manufactured}} for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the image <b>intensifier</b> within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the microchannel plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant current draw from the microchannel plate, it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of image intensifiers is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} upwards <b>intensifiers</b> (adverbs of intensifying) in the English, German and Croatian language. Intensity as an {{important}} human cognitive category, and language expressivity is differently treated in grammars and dictionaries of all three languages, especially with respect to different degrees of intensity. In this paper we {{argue that it is}} possible to model a typology of upwards adverb <b>intensifiers</b> in the three languages, according to their morphosyntactic and semantic aspects. When it comes to <b>intensifiers,</b> it is necessary to describe which collocates are modified by <b>intensifiers</b> and which semantic fields the collocates belong to. The results of the corpus analysis based on Harry Potter novels show that all the three languages express the category of the upwards intensity in the same way: the number of <b>intensifiers</b> is similar, the collocates mostly belong to the same semantic fields and word classes, they have similar syntactic functions...|$|R
40|$|This article {{extends the}} {{definition}} of sensationalism to print media and argues {{that the use of}} <b>intensifiers</b> may be an aspect of sensationalism. In addition, this paper states that a perception of sensationalism is a mediating state which may be induced by the use of sensationalistic message features. In two between-subjects experiments, these claims are investigated for positively and negatively framed news articles. Both experiments support the hypothesis that <b>intensifiers</b> can increase perceived language intensity. In the first experiment, <b>intensifiers</b> had a negative effect on appreciation of the news article, which was not influenced by perceived language intensity. In the second experiment, positive indirect effects of <b>intensifiers</b> x perceived language intensity on newsworthiness and the attitude towards the article were found. No framing effects were observed...|$|R

30|$|<b>Intensifiers</b> {{refer to}} {{words such as}} very, quite, most, etc. These are the words that change {{sentiment}} of the neighbouring non-neutral terms. They {{can be divided into}} two categories [29], namely amplifiers (very, most) and downtoners (slightly) that increase and decrease the intensity of sentiment, respectively. In our approach 25 most frequently applied <b>intensifiers</b> were selected and then, depending on their polarity, they were divided into 3 categories, namely downtoners, weak amplifiers and strong amplifiers. Empirically downtoners represent <b>intensifiers</b> that decrease value of the sentiment by 50  %. Weak and strong amplifiers increase sentiment by 50 and 100  %, respectively.|$|R

This study is an attempt to investigate the differential usage of <b>intensifiers</b> in male and female speech in Persian. About four hours of naturally-occurring spontaneous conversations between male and female participants were recorded, transcribed and examined for the use of <b>intensifiers.</b> Frequency counts and the Chi-square test were used to analyze the data. The results indicated that women used <b>intensifiers</b> significantly more than men. The findings were seen to support the previous findings in this regard.

25|$|The Leclerc tank {{features}} the HL-60 gunner's primary sight from SAGEM. The sight's day channel offers X3.3 and X10 magnification (x14 {{in case of}} the UAE version). The night channel thermal <b>intensifier</b> offers X3, X6, X10 and X20 magnifications. No emergency or auxiliary sights are mounted. The laser range finder is of the Nd:YAG type. The tank commander can observe the surroundings through 7 periscopes and the HL-70 Panoramic sight. The HL-70 {{is equipped with a}} day channel at X2.5 and X10 magnification and a night channel with X2.5 magnification. On the Series XXI and UAE variant the HL-120 and HL-80 commander's panoramic sight are mounted respectively. The sight offers X2.5 and X10 magnification (and an electronic zoom X2) for the thermal <b>intensifier</b> and a laser range finder of the Nd:YAG type. Both sights are also equipped with a semi auto tracker for target acquisition. The combination of the gunner's primary sight and commander's panoramic sight allows the Leclerc to operate in a hunter-killer mode.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} Generation 3 Omni VII and Generation 3+, {{following}} the issues experienced with generation IV technology, Thin Film technology became {{the standard for}} current image <b>intensifier</b> technology. In Thin Film image intensifiers, {{the thickness of the}} film is reduced from around 30 Angstrom (standard) to around 10 Angstrom and the photocathode voltage is lowered. This causes fewer electrons to be stopped than with third generation tubes, while providing the benefits of a filmed tube.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{since the}} {{limiting}} resolution is usually {{defined as the}} point at which the MTF is three percent or less, this would also be the maximum resolution of the tube. The MTF is affected by every part of an image <b>intensifier</b> tube's operation and on a complete system is also affected by the quality of the optics involved. Factors that affect the MTF include transition through any fiber plate or glass, at the screen and the photocathode and also through the tube and the microchannel plate itself. The higher the MTF at a given resolution, the better.|$|E

In {{view of their}} enormous variety and subtle differences in use within and across languages, this paper sets out to investigate equivalences in translation between English and Italian <b>intensifiers</b> and predicate-intensifier collocations. Crucially, due attention {{will be given to}} <b>intensifiers</b> as expressions of speaker’s attitudes and evaluations and, hence, to connotational and pragmatic equivalences between source and target language at the micro-textual level...|$|R
40|$|Night vision devices, such image <b>intensifiers</b> and {{infrared}} imagers, {{are readily available}} {{to a host of}} nations, organizations, and individuals through international commerce. Once the trademark of special operations units, these devices are widely advertised to ''turn night into day''. In truth, they cannot accomplish this formidable task, but they do offer impressive enhancement of vision in limited light scenarios through electronically generated images. Image <b>intensifiers</b> {{and infrared}} imagers are both electronic devices for enhancing vision in the dark. However, each is based upon a totally different physical phenomenon. Image <b>intensifiers</b> amplify the available light energy whereas infrared imagers detect the thermal energy radiated from all objects. Because of this, each device operates from energy which is present in a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. This leads to differences in the ability of each device to detect and/or identify objects. This report is a compilation of the available information on both state-of-the-art image <b>intensifiers</b> and infrared imagers. Image <b>intensifiers</b> developed in the United States, as well as some foreign made image <b>intensifiers,</b> are discussed. Image <b>intensifiers</b> are categorized according to their spectral response and sensitivity using the nomenclature of GEN I, GEN II, and GEN III. As the first generation of image <b>intensifiers,</b> GEN I, were large and of limited performance, this report will deal with only GEN II and GEN III equipment. Infrared imagers are generally categorized according to their spectral response, sensor materials, and related sensor operating temperature using the nomenclature Medium Wavelength Infrared (MWIR) Cooled and Long Wavelength Infrared (LWIR) Uncooled. MWIR Cooled refers to infrared imagers which operate in the 3 to 5 {micro}m wavelength electromagnetic spectral region and require either mechanical or thermoelectric coolers to keep the sensors operating at 77 K. LWIR Uncooled refers to infrared imagers which operate in the 8 to 12 {micro}m wavelength electromagnetic spectral region and do not require cooling below room temperature. Both commercial and military infrared sensors of these two types are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to describe the use and behavior of adverbial <b>intensifiers</b> of adjectives in today's informal spoken British English. For the lack of freely available corpora, {{the language of the}} popular television series Skins is used as the source of material. In the theoretical part of the thesis, the use of <b>intensifiers</b> based on their elementary syntactic and semantic functions is briefly described, and the main tendencies that influence their behavior in present-day colloquial English are characterized. The theoretical part then lists the basic features of the grammar of conversation and identifies the differences between authentic conversation and television dialogue. Finally, it gives a short description of the use and behavior of <b>intensifiers</b> {{in the language of the}} American sitcom Friends. The initial section of the practical part of the thesis examines the features of conversational grammar in the Skins dialogues.

25|$|Modern {{image intensifiers}} no longer use a {{separate}} fluorescent screen. Instead, a caesium iodide phosphor is deposited {{directly on the}} photocathode of the <b>intensifier</b> tube. On a typical general purpose system, the output image is approximately 105 times brighter than the input image. This brightness gain comprises a flux gain (amplification of photon number) and minification gain (concentration of photons from a large input screen onto a small output screen) each of approximately 100. This level of gain is sufficient that quantum noise, due to {{the limited number of}} X-ray photons, is a significant factor limiting image quality.|$|E
25|$|Fluoroscopy is an imaging {{technique}} commonly used by physicians or radiation therapists to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} internal structures of a patient {{through the use of}} a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an X-ray image <b>intensifier</b> and CCD video camera allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor. This method may use a contrast material. Examples include cardiac catheterization (to examine for coronary artery blockages) and barium swallow (to examine for esophageal disorders).|$|E
25|$|Although not {{formally}} recognized under the U.S. generation categories, Super Second Generation or SuperGen {{was developed in}} 1989 by Jacques Dupuy and Gerald Wolzak. This technology improved the tri-alkali photocathodes to more than double their sensitivity while also improving the microchannel plate by increasing the open-area ratio to 70% while reducing the noise level. This allowed second generation tubes, which are more economical to manufacture, to achieve comparable results to third generation image <b>intensifier</b> tubes. With sensitivities of the photocathodes approaching 700 uA/lm and extended frequency response to 950nm, this technology continued to be developed outside of the U.S., notably by Photonis and now forms the basis for most non-US manufactured high-end night vision equipment.|$|E
